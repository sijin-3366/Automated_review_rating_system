rating,review
2.0,The picture and pattern do not match.
2.0,Too small in waste.Too pong in length
2.0,The inside material is rather thin and ripped on me already where the cards go.  I got this because I needed a new case and wallet and thought the combination case/wallet would be a good idea.  It would have been if it were made with better materials. All in all not happy with this product.
2.0,I love the look of these sandals but for some reason the left sandal was smaller than the right one and I had to give them away. Beading also scratched the top of my foot so I had to put a band ache to prenvent futher injury to my foot.
2.0,"I wanted to like this shirt so bad.  I followed the sizing guidelines and bought a small which was still too large for me around the arms, around the neck, and in the chest.  Also, the shirt was somewhat see through too.  Adorable print though."
2.0,I expected it to be a coat. Instead  I got a fashionable lined shirt. No pockets as well.
2.0,Nice quality but tiny and returned it.
2.0,Ok quality but the size is very small. My 13 year old can't wear it. It doesn't fit her head. We were disappointed.
2.0,Can't breath a lick if you sweat in it. They are great if you are not going to  sweat. But I bought them for work and working out. Lab mask are better.
2.0,Bought these in size 18 months and they are about 3 sizes bigger than stated on the tag
2.0,Interior circumference is a little too small
2.0,Runs way to small and lays funny on the body
2.0,These run extremely small way way to small and tight on my girls. Deff order up two sizes this looks like it was made for a kid
2.0,Too tight thru mud section and hips
2.0,Came with a stain
2.0,"junk, and it was expensive. returned"
2.0,Lightweight but way too floppy and would get in her eyes. Annoying.
2.0,Cute swimsuit but the top is way to small and the bottoms are a little big. They both say the same size but don’t fit like they should. I wouldn’t have been able to size up or down to make this one fit.
2.0,My daughter daughter these with her own money... it broke in half the first time she wore it. Waste of money!!
2.0,Had it just over a month and it broke.
2.0,It is a pretty dress. Too bad my zip broke before I could even wear the dress once and I ordered the correct size.
2.0,Broke after a couple weeks of use.
2.0,"Love the color and fabric but WAY too big. The top is also weird and does not fit properly , the straps, although adjustable, are way too long and too low cut even if I make them super short. Pass this up, it does not fit like the picture shows. It’s not worth my time to send it back, I could possibly use it as a swimsuit coverup.... maybe"
2.0,"Shimmer not as good as others I have.  Also, I purchased 7.5 to 8, they do not appear to be that large.  They are definitely not 8"
2.0,Not very exciting no support at all I doubt I will wear them. I was looking for some color at an inexpensive price .....
2.0,"I normally wear a 34DD in all my bras to include sports bras. I could not even get this bra on. The shape of the bra is much too small. I have not ever had issues with sports bras ill fitting, but I am not sure who this bra was designed for. You have to be a child to wear these bras. I would not recommend this bra to anyone unless you have a very small frame."
2.0,"Very low quality. It's not cozy, like it looks in the picture. It's thin and cheap, with bulky, messy seams and big visible stripes where the pocket is sewn in that make it look like you have a turtle tummy."
2.0,"I just received my package. I was super excited and I thought everything was fine, but I was wrong. I tried on my coat it definitely was not the right side. I ordered an XXL and I'm pretty sure its a L and really short on the length. I tried on the shirt and its loose which is good but I realized there wasn't any hole. You could see where the button should be going in but there is no hole TO put in. The pants were fine and so was the leg piece. But I'm kind of bummed out they didn't check the sizing before shipping. Definitely going to have to return and hopefully they'll get the right size..."
2.0,"The material is light but it was to small, tight around my ears and to close to my face made it feel uncomfortable."
2.0,Broke with a few weeks.
2.0,"This runs extremely small.  I am 5'4, 120 lbs and I couldn't even get this shirt on-ordered a Large.  It fits my 6 year old granddaughter."
2.0,Poor quality. Came missing a bead
2.0,"The shirt looks great when you get it, but it is nearly impossible to iron after washing it. I bought this shirt to wear to work with a tie and it took me forever to iron it to some condition appropriate for work. Near the seams it is wrinkled even when you're trying to iron it because it is smaller by the seams. The collar is floppy too for what that is worth. If you're planning to wear this to work or anywhere else that you need it ironed, I would suggest looking elsewhere.<br />This is the only shirt I could find in the orange color that I wanted which is the up side to this shirt; there are several color options that aren't easy to find."
2.0,The color of stone was pretty but I noticed there was crack in the stone.
2.0,quality not that great- strap & design too small
2.0,It would be great if it had pockets like the picture VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT 😒 😕 its just ok.... material is a little to thin too...
2.0,"Way too slim cut for a man, ordered a size larger and still didn't fit. The fabric is also see-through, so unless that's what you're going for, I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,I returned these. They do not fit like a skinny jean but more like a straight leg. Not tight and not stretchy. Not like pictured here.
2.0,"This jacket is 100 percent polyester, but simulating wool.  I thought this might be good for cleaning purposes but the fabric a little stiff and it sort of squeaks when you bunch it up.  The fit is not very flattering as a result.  I am returning."
2.0,"Sorry but I receive a&#34;Moon Triplet, 18mm10X not a 10X x21mm.  However I an very pleased with the Moon Triplet that replaced my 54 year old B. & L Hastings Triplet."
2.0,Falls off due to heat
2.0,"The leather cord on this necklace is okay, but the assembly of the bead pendant is very shoddy and lop-sided.  Looks like something made in summer camp."
2.0,I would size up 2 sizes. I wear a medium in everything and ordered a medium. WAY TOO SMALL
2.0,Very cute but very poor quality
2.0,"LOVE the look of this ring, however, I just got it a few days ago and half of the gems have already fallen out :( very disappointing..."
2.0,"If you are buying this for a small child then it might work, too small for any adult. Beautiful though."
2.0,Very cheap and horrible bubble-gum pink color. Returned dress.
2.0,Definitely inaccurate description. Runs small. Still super cute though so I'm keeping.
2.0,They are cute but cheaply made. The zipper busted as I was packing the first time using them. Next time I'll spend more money and get the compression packs.
2.0,Picture deceiving. No utensils included. I had picked this option since it was supposed to include utensils too. Disappointing.
2.0,I love the fit but worry about it because the cut out designs go pretty high so I worry they’ll show my goods
2.0,"Smaller than expected, not much stretch in fabric."
2.0,Love the colors. Love the fit. Went to squat test them and noticed a rip across the bum area. Super disappointed was really excited to wear these.
2.0,"Stretched out in no time (2 wearings), which was a bummer.  That was disappointing to my teenager.  Ah well.  Very cute styling, though."
2.0,Cheap cheap. Seams are not lined up. Elbow patches not in right place. Very thin.
2.0,This is not a sweatshirt. It's a shirt. It's not warm at all. The pink is not at all accurate on the website vs. the product I received. I will be returning.
2.0,Its functionality remains a total mystery
2.0,Way more boxy than pictured. Returning.
2.0,"These are soooooo small that I gave them to my 6-year-old grand-daughter, and they were even a bit too small for her ears.  They are actually small enough for a doll to wear.  No joke!"
2.0,you couldnt remove the label on the glass which is by your eyes
2.0,It don't look like the picture. Would return it but it's not worth it.
2.0,"nice shirt, I ordered for my son because he wanted the fitted look.  We got his original size but the shirt fits big, too big for fitted look."
2.0,"The fit is fine, I like the pockets, but the material is so thin that it's a brighter white wherever it overlaps. I could have gotten around this by wearing neutral colored underwear, except for the wrapped bust, and pockets. I imagine this is not an issue with other colors, so might consider trying those, but had to rate based on the color I needed."
2.0,It's cheaply made. My anklet broke after just a single wear.
2.0,The fabric flew off of the lei and got all over. Doesn't look legit either.
2.0,"Fits great looks good, my wife loves it, but it did not come with the battery which is another 50 dollars! That's crazy not worth it."
2.0,Too long also! Don't like the material either.
2.0,The quality was not what I expected it could have been better overall the fishnets are cute but I wouldn’t order them again
2.0,Love the dress but super see through. Very disappointed.
2.0,"I am 5'2"" and weighs 175 lbs, I ordered a XL and it was too big. The dress is beautiful and the fabric is nice."
2.0,It's really hard to get on your ear and doesn't bend. It got here weeks early though.
2.0,"This shirt is very short. It's cute, but I would reccomend this shirt for someone with a flat stomach, unlike mine."
2.0,I bought these for my husband and he does ac/heating and is on the rooftops 150 degrees and these boots don’t have any traction they slip in water please know if you are working in these kinda places please don’t spend your money on these boots my husband does like to where them when we go to dinner but not to work very dangerous
2.0,They dont increase the size of the graphic with the size of the shirt. Pixilated. And this is Chinese sizes so 3XL is a Large
2.0,This didn’t work for my Athletic build..
2.0,"Bummed!!  I thought this was going to be my pretty Halloween ring.  Looks cheap and the black eyes are too big and kind of overtake the ring (I think).  Also, it didn't seem very sparkly (although I didn't try it on in the sunlight."
2.0,These did not fit or look like little aviators like I thought they would.
2.0,It is definitely smaller then what the sizing chart says it sohould be. Thankfully I bought two sizes and was able to wear the bigger one. It was cute otherwise but I was happy I bought a pettycoat to go under it. Otherwise it would have been very flat.
2.0,half the clamps would not open
2.0,"It came very small, not even half of the length of the scarf pictures. It's okay if you're looking for something not as poofy or big as normal fashion scarves, and I'm going to keep it and wear it still, it's just a smaller scarf. The cats on the fabric also look somewhat distorted and squished, but you can't really tell when you're wearing it."
2.0,Threads were tangled and it broke after about a month
2.0,Fit as expected but looked pajamish and made my hips look bigger. Returned.
2.0,It is big for xs
2.0,"The fabrics are lightweight and the patterns are cute, but one of the caps arrived with buttons that were cracked in half with pieces in the bottom of the bag it came in. None of the ribbons are finished, so they unravel and one fell off after just one wash. Overall, the quality was lacking."
2.0,Love the style but the multi focal areas are not compatible with my vision. I have to tilt my head back to read my phone screen
2.0,Mask is small so filter just makes it tighter to wear and it did not have the nose clip as pictured online. Very limited wear time as a result.
2.0,Okay so I was really excited about these and when they first came in they seemed great. I almost compared them to my gymshark vital seamless shorts but upon wearing them. They are not the same. There’s too much stretch and not enough compression. Almost none. And if you wear them to workout they are not gonna be squat proof but the most annoying part to me is that they roll up the entire workout
2.0,"Well, I have to update and change my review. I did love them, and yes...they are very comfortable, but when the quality come in to play...that changes everything. They are coming apart at the seems where the material is sewn to the bottom pad. If I was rough on them, I would expect it, but I only wear them inside and most of that time is with my feet up in my recliner. Very disappointing because I did love them. I wouldn't have a problem if they lasted at least for a year. Oh well, I guess I've learned my lesson and will probably go back to cheaper ones from WalMart that I won't mind throwing away each season."
2.0,They were at least one size too big!
2.0,I am 5’6” 170 size 14.  I bought an xl and it fit.  However I returned this drea because it was touching the floor when I put it on.  It was very cheaply made.  I was disappointed.
2.0,"This is too larger to fit me. And the materials is hard and sticky, not very comfortable to wear."
2.0,"While comfortable, these are *not* workout shorts. Even the tag on the clothing calls it ""intimates"". These are definitely more shorts you'd wear under a dress to try and slim you down. It's a thick material that I would not workout in."
2.0,"Very pretty and sturdy. I received this for Christmas. The power plug lights up when used however even with batteries, I have no success getting it powered on."
2.0,When opened package letters had shirt stuck together had to pull apart.  Very this shirt. You can see through it.
2.0,This dress was too short. If I was a woman I would not order to wear out for a night on the town. If you need someone to wear once to a halloween party or dark night club go for it. But don't wear in a well lit ballroom because the other women will read you to filth. I will be using it for a drag performance.
2.0,The worse quality I bought on Amazon. The robber stickers cracked and peel even before the first wash. Colors are not as vibrant as on the picture. Fabric is a solid color with stickers that don't stick - it is not normal fabric knit. Carter would never make anything like this. Overpriced junk.
2.0,The material is very very cheap and not of good quality AT ALL
2.0,"The bands aren’t the easiest to put on by yourself when the watch is on your wrist. I had to stretch the bands a little bit when I took it on and off, which caused the end loop to tear. When I went to use the extra, the middle black metal piece that connects to the actual watch broke off, so now it won’t hold."
2.0,"I like the design of this watch and I think the color is perfect, but after a month of continuous use the strap has cracked and both small straps have broken off. But you get what you pay for!"
2.0,Touch screen doesnt work well
2.0,[[VIDEOID:5645db526fcb710432d069860a5bda98]] The socks are very comfortable. My one complaint is in only a month there’s a hole the size of a quarter in the inside seam near my ankle! I’m bummed. Past the return date by 2 days. My loss I guess.
2.0,"I am 5’3 and 235 lbs, I ordered a 3x. It fits good but the material is so cheap and really thin and very clingy. If you have any body rolls this dress will find it and show it off. The picture looks a whole lot better than the actual dress. If you like the polyester/spandex type of material that you can see through then this is your dress. I have 2 stars instead of nothing because it fits and it’s long enough and I like the color but that’s about it."
2.0,"NOT COTTON ... Cute but it's polyester or something , not as discribed"
2.0,"Unfortunately, the quality of the material doesn't lend well to the style as seen in the photo. Also the inside seem area will become distressed from walking and legs rubbing together. Looks fashionable, but is not quality leisure wear. It's synthetic."
2.0,"I've been reading the reviews and realized sellers are using the word ""LIGHT""...which obviously means ""HOLLOW!"
2.0,Ordered a medium for a friend. Got a large that said sizes 9.5-10... well it fit my size 7 foot...... keeping them for myself. They look kinda cheap. But super soft!
2.0,"Nice pants for under $20 bucks, however size chart is not accurate. Run excessively small."
2.0,At first I thought I absolutely loved these sure they were a little small but they stretch. I went through 3 pairs no issue the next 2 right where the elastic label is they ripped. Besides that they are pretty decent.
2.0,"No zipper on pockets, flimsy material and the color was darker than expected . Cute style."
2.0,"Runs small, and poor fabric"
2.0,Bought these because I wanted to have my sunglasses float but they don’t. Nice design and comfy.
2.0,"Things slipped out of this for me all the time, and did not work as I would have hoped."
2.0,"Looks nice, but construction is like something you get in the discount isle at Walmart."
2.0,"They are not green, more like a bronze."
2.0,The logo is pretty cheaply made
2.0,"It's what you would expect for an $11 swimsuit. Quality is poor though wearable, but they run small. Unless it's suppose to fit a certain way and I'm just not a fan idk. The straps on the back &#34;stick out&#34; so to speak on the lower back, which looks tacky. Overall is wasn't comfortable which is a must for me."
2.0,"Snug, but comfortable on a size 10 men's foot. Unfortunately, right out of the package they had a hole in them. :-("
2.0,Very small and quality wasn’t that great.
2.0,Sweater was as expected but when I took it out of the bag to try it on OMGGGG it smelled of man's dirty armpit that's been in 110 degree heat without deodorant all day..its awfulllllll!!! Not even sure if its going to wash out or that going to wash with my other clothes in fear the smell might spread into my other clothes and not come out!!!
2.0,The quality of this shirt seemed ok but it was way too large and it came with shoulder pads sewn in. I will be returning.
2.0,I thought super dark would actually be dark. Not even close. Medium grey at best and that is me being generous. Also the fit of the glasses- at least for me sticks out on the sides versus the true wrap around I got from the Bobsters I unfortunately lost on a ride out to the desert.
2.0,Good quality expect the clasp broke almost immediately! So now it won’t grip things. Pretty disappointing
2.0,The quick release break off piece broke and now I can't use it. I have 2 piece of lanyard that can't go over my neck.
2.0,The fabric is nice however the size runs small. I followed the chart and it is at least 2 sizes smaller than advertised.
2.0,The it's very short..
2.0,"I was not a fan of this dress. It was cheap material and didn’t really hug my body as expected. It was very frumpy looking.<br />It did have a very big stretch to it as well and the material was rather heavy, so I don’t think it helped that issue.<br />Maybe try it in a smaller size to get better body definitely and hold.<br />I personally would not recommend this though."
2.0,I ordered a size medium for my boyfriend. The pair I received say medium but they are preposterously huge. It looks more like an XXL than a medium. They're very soft and probably extremely comfortable but the size is entirely wrong.
2.0,"The braiding is lovely, but the wristlet came unglued from its metal holder as soon as I started putting my keys on it - I didn't even get to use it before it fell apart! Quality is reflected in its low price point. Will be contacting seller for refund."
2.0,The straps are not adjustable.  The cut was too high up to be comfortable.
2.0,"It is very very very short, Im not tall but will need to either lengthen it or wear something under it ..."
2.0,the product was damaged in the corners of the glass. They look awesome but you can notice that they are broken
2.0,I do like it but cant wear coz its much too big for me... i have a small wrist
2.0,These smell so bad. I ended up not using
2.0,items were cute and easy to latch on to clothes but the ears arrived broken. headband is not very sturdy / strong.
2.0,Its ok ..its for work durt/ dust  but not good for rain or snow
2.0,Adorable but fell apart after two washes.  Not too durable for a kids dress.
2.0,Was very pretty but sizing is off by alot. I ordered a 2x and it fit my size medium friend.
2.0,Not even remotely slim fit design and top button popped off the first time I wore it.
2.0,Not the same as I expected. Cuz I bought one for my kid last year. And I can feel the old one is thicker than the new one.
2.0,"This skirt looks like what it costs, which is no compliment. It doesn’t fit well and the seems are off. Thumbs down."
2.0,You get a lot but it shreds like crazy
2.0,"I’ll make this simple by listing the pros and cons, then go into detail underneath.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Wasn’t broken when received<br />- Could be a craft base (?)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Crazy fragile<br />- Cheap paint job<br />- Poor craftsmanship<br />- Unusable shedding strings to hold it in place(?)<br /><br />This was really, really underwhelming to receive. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t order this with high expectations because I read the other reviews. I held my breath as I opened the box, hoping it wasn’t broken, and… it wasn’t! As I held it, I could immediately tell how fragile it was though. Fortunately, I was prepared with hot glue by my side to avoid it shattering on Halloween…<br /><br />but the paint job is horrific, and whoever sculpted/molded this really gave up near the end.<br /><br />The paint wasn’t realistic, but wasn’t clean either. It’s the same type you’d see on a cheap full-faced mask for $5. This would’ve been better with no paint, or a solid white/bone color.<br /><br />I didn’t plan on playing dentist either, but I can clearly see how the teeth were *supposed* to be shaped… so I’m using a nail file to shape them. Luckily, some of the smaller “extra bits” came off easily. The rest will take some time.<br /><br />Finally, I’m not sure how I’m supposed to wear this. It came with 2 strings, which isn’t reassuring because they can’t carry the weight of the mask, I’ll be walking, and the mask is really fragile. I wouldn’t want them on my face, hair, or neck anyway because when I removed them (to secure the mask with hot glue) I found the strings were shedding. It was on both sides of the mask and my hands… a bit messier than I had anticipated. I might place the mask on top of another mask- or buy elastic bands for it instead… I’m investing into this more than I’d like.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this product if you’re not willing to put some work into it. Plus, I’d say this is worth about $6-$8 max. There’s not many positive things to say, since this is supposed to be the final product. If this were a base, then it’d be different… but this is advertised as a mask."
2.0,Lightweight and  water resistant but back pocket is exactly in the middle(not on the side). Would not buy again.
2.0,"Based on some of the answered questions, I was expecting these to be at least partially made of cotton. They are polyester, and definitely feel like it.  I found a better pair by Champion that are made of cotton."
2.0,"Doesn't really seem to help. Only worn my nubra twice and the cleanser has done nothing to restore or revive the sticky of the bra. There is no more sticky around the edges of my nubra, and I've followed the directions exactly and the sticky just won't come back. Pretty disappointing."
2.0,The buried half zip is a royal pain. Zipper is pretty cheap and where it is installed you fight your natural curves to get it zipped.
2.0,"These ""safety"" glasses come in a sweet little case and look great for just being safety glasses. The thing that broke the deal for me is that after wearing them for a short period of time I became dizzy as they have this weird augmentation. These are more of a hazard than safety glasses."
2.0,Too big for my ear and the part that goes into my ear lobe broke off immediately.
2.0,To small. Not much room to put anything in it I thought the purse was much bigger.
2.0,not tall enough
2.0,Not happy with size. I ordered a 8.5 but it is more like 9.5 . I will have to send back and get a smaller size. But it looks nice.
2.0,Strap immediately broke as soon as I took the dress out of the bag.
2.0,"Very cute, but the hardware on the suspenders is very cheap.  Ours broke before even managing to put them on the first time.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"Realizing feet aren’t the same size, left too big and right fine."
2.0,"Not reversible like advertised, very odd shape, way to short in back."
2.0,"Don't waste ur money, No support for standing all day."
2.0,Very nice material. Ran larger than I thought - probably should have ordered an extra small. Color is different than pictured almost seems like a pinkish purple gray.  Disappointed in color.
2.0,"It is cute but, doesn’t stretch, it’s only about the size of my hand and barely fits over my head. The pictures do not give an accurate representation of how it really looks."
2.0,Was very disappointed in the material. It is very thin and like a spandex or nylon material. Looks good but definitely wont keep you warm if that's what you're looking for
2.0,"ADULT size, these fit my husband (who has a big head) WAY too big for my 9 year old."
2.0,Runs very small. Not super thrilled with the material. It felt a bit cheap.
2.0,"Still haven't made a decision on whether I like it or not... I love the style and look of it, but I can't say it's worth $15. I'm not sure if it's hand stitched or done by an automatic machine but the fabric/design is so uneven that I had to adjust it to where part of the seam was on my back. The listing pictures show that the top doesn't go straight across and has a hump (I guess you would call it) along the top but it is so uneven because the stitching scrunches up on one side and doesn't on the other... so if I do decide to keep and wear it, I'll have to tuck it in.<br />The next down side is it is a very, very cheap material. It's the same material that you would use for a baithing suit... except a baithing suit is layered with another fabric on the back to make it thicker and more durable.<br />And finally.. again since I'm not sure if it's hand stitched,  I'm wondering about the stains on it. There are patches of yellowish brown spots that are mostly around just the seam. I'm not sure if this is a result of it being hand made and marking where to cut the fabric or not but I'm going to reach out to the seller and ask.<br /><br />I'll update with my decision, but it really isn't worth the price having all of these issues...but I do like it and can manage to work with it."
2.0,shoes did not last long
2.0,I usually wear a M/L bought an XXL just in case and it was still way to small I returned it
2.0,The cut of the dress was shorter than expected. The material felt uncomfortable. I would have preferred the style in a cotton fabric.
2.0,"I am pleased with the look and operation of the watch, but the band broke within about 2 months of wear. It's a cheap watch, but not THAT cheap. My $10 Walmart watches have lasted longer."
2.0,Vest looked fine. Size was grossly misstated.
2.0,I ordered a 2xl and it's too small.  My current coat is a large and barely fits so I thought it would and I can't even button it up.
2.0,"I liked these earring a lot when I first ordered, really beautiful, but unfortunately I think my backings are defective, because I’ve lost one earring not knowing, and I am disappointed about that and left with one earring."
2.0,"Bad quality, weird material, just fixes awkward.. luckily it wasn’t send it the time frame so it was free! But if not I would have definitely returned it"
2.0,too lightweight for me but otherwise perfect
2.0,Too short size run small
2.0,The material is way to sheer and the sizing was way off-I ordered up a size and it was still too small in the chest
2.0,"it runs small, the color didn't look like the pic.  It says wine red, looks more like rust colored red.  I wouldn't buy again, thankfully low price."
2.0,Will do in a pinch.
2.0,Hangs like a maternity dress but I wear a belt with it and it looks great. Material is very thin.
2.0,Made very cheaply.  Tassels were not as pictured.
2.0,"Coloring is off in picture. Received this and the beautiful band was more of a dull sand color. The rose gold was a lot more pink than the picture as well. Overall, it looked cheap. I understand it's only a $40 watch, but with such rave reviews on the other colors, I expected this to look great. Returned."
2.0,"If only they would stay on.....lovely, otherwise."
2.0,"These clips are nearly impossible to open. Once you do get them open, they don't slide nicely like other clips I have purchased. Very poorly made. I purchased these for handmade bracelets and you would never be able to get the bracelet off your arm with these clips. The package they arrived in was ridiculously taped with packing tape,like someone had opened them previously. I returned them."
2.0,Should have been longer for the waistline
2.0,"It is a nice product, a little thinner then I thought it would be but other then that I am pleased with it."
2.0,This dress was nothing like pictured. It was form fitting and no key hole button in back. It was a ‘V’ in the back with zipper.  Very disappointed.
2.0,This was super tiny. I am 5'4&#34; and 114 pounds. It was not near long enough. I doubt the biggest size they have would even fit me that's how small it was.
2.0,"I was extremely disappointed  in the color--I wanted brown, this is light taupe. The material hangs on you--no fit at all--I have already given it away to charity-- not worth returning"
2.0,Cute look but very cheaply constructed.
2.0,The bottom fit just right but the top is not made for large breasted women
2.0,My 3 year old son loved these.  The first pistol broke within 10 minutes.  The second one broke after about 2 hours of him constantly pulling the trigger.
2.0,Not very well made.  Some of the ruffles were caught by the stitching.  Not what I was hoping for and the fit was not what I normally get.  I bought a size larger as suggested but it was still too small.
2.0,"This tee is probably great for teens.  Because it literally looks like you are wearing it inside out! So if that is you thing, go for it."
2.0,"This shirt is much cuter online than in person. I ordered the smallest size possible (I'm 4'10, 110lbs) and when I took it out of the package I swear it was a XXXL rather than an XS. It was SO big! I could fit two of me in there! But then once I put it on, the sleeves were too short, but the rest was too big? It was just awkward. It would have been really cute too."
2.0,Very cheap looking I guess because it was and you get what you pay for
2.0,Not enough pictures were posted to tell how the flip out portion was.
2.0,Great price but not very protective!
2.0,Nowhere close to half an inch per the description (also deceiving photo with model).  These are tiny tiny hoops.
2.0,Runs small in waist
2.0,"the picture shows a different look from the actual item, it never stands tall as shown in this picture."
2.0,"Seller cut the shein tag off of it but left the hanger straps on, and the white is very see through but fits nicely"
2.0,"The only thing that made this purchase worth while was the cheap price. They seemed a little too small for mediums, not much room for business. Also some had seams sewn directly across the front, as if they were made with scrap pieces of fabric."
2.0,The shirt I ordered was not like the shirt pictures on Amazon - the flowers are the only thing white - everything else is black. Sadly I don’t like it as much .
2.0,It’s too small couldn’t really feet has to cut it up to a diy wouldn’t recommend
2.0,"I’m between a Medium and a Large, in most clothing, so I opted for a large. It is quite small though...especially for a jacket. Bummed because it’s very nice looking."
2.0,"The colors are a matter of personal preference.  I have several different types of silicone rings, and these seem pretty good. A silicone ring will never accurately replicate the look of a metal ring, but if you're going this route than these seem like a solid choice.  They seem to fit smaller than the sizing indicates. I typically wear a size 9.5. I ordered the size 10, and it fits too snug.  Other than the sizing issue, they seem pretty good.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />*edit - after wearing these rings for a few days, the sizing really proved to be a problem.  The ring fit so tight, and in an airtight fashion, that my skin underneath turned white.  Until they get their sizing issues sorted out, I can't recommend these."
2.0,"Wasn't nearly as heavy and warm feeling as I had hoped. Maybe they make a heavier one. I know they used to, anyway."
2.0,They’re cute but half of them arrived broken which caused my daughter to burst into tears. I would’ve rather paid more and gotten functional headbands.
2.0,This top is a bit too short. The worst part about it is that it is pretty tight in the chest area. This is not made for girls with boobs (I am a 34c). I typically wear M/L in tops and I ordered this in a L. Returning this. So much potential but just fell flat.
2.0,They fit in the fram. But they are loose and rattle in the okley fram. They look nice (good mirror and clean) so this is why I gave them 2 stars.
2.0,This is supposed to be a 3x but fit like a medium 🤣🤣🤣🤣 don't buy
2.0,The image is beautiful but the way it is offset somehow makes my face look crooked.<br />I love it but cannot wear it because my face looks really crooked with it on.
2.0,This material is literally what you could find at Party City...not impressed for almost $30.
2.0,"Looks nothing like it does on here the colors are not bright, the printing is very poor it looks like the image is cracking just completely looks faded as if I have had this shirt for 3+ years easy but barely took it out of  its package was looking forward to wearing it for Halloween but not anymore."
2.0,They fit but are tight. Do not put in dryer. If they shrink at all she will not be able to wear.
2.0,"Quick shipping. Not as described. Described as &#34;4.3/4 X 3.3/4&#34; which would have replaced my old inserts perfectly. However the product delivered is 5&#34; x 3 3/4&#34;, larger than what I needed and larger than advertised. Caveat emptor. The vendor promised a suitable product, delivered an unsuitable product."
2.0,Received it today. Fit as expected. Nice color. Inside pocket. I didn’t order the thin one because I needed it for cold weather. The thick one also is way too thin for cold weather. The zipper didn’t move very smoothly and kept getting stuck. After 10 minutes of checking it all out I returned it. I often will say something is worth the price but I don’t believe that to be the case here. All of my bomber/flight jackets are more lined than this one and they were around the same price with sturdy closures. It seems definitely worth paying a bit more than this one though for something that will be more well made.
2.0,"They fit small , I was hoping for it to be longer and more loose fitting"
2.0,"really cheap looking,not a fan"
2.0,Cute color but the leg openings were too loose since there was no additional elastic. It was self fabric openings. Thet kept riding up. I will not keep them.
2.0,"I loved the way these jeans looked so I had high hopes for them, apparently too high cause when I got them, they were just slightly too tight and uncomfortable around the waist"
2.0,"The thumb hole section of the sleeves where obviously sewn on the wrong sides, as seen in a prior picture. Thinner material than expected and fit was smaller than expected. Ended up returning."
2.0,The pants were very comfortable but the jacket runs small. The material is thin but has a lot of stretch and is comfortable. Big issue is the hot pink colors don’t match on the jacket and pants
2.0,"I recently ordered the brown version of this bag. Liked it so, decided to get it in black and it bag in a resealed bag plastic bag, no box and cat hair inside the bag."
2.0,In the picture the material lookes to be more like cotton but it was more like 100% spandex
2.0,"These came fast because I have amazon prime, but honestly I'm sending these back. They were so think that they wouldnt sit flush with my ears. I also ordered the lightest color, and received a pair that is much much darker than pictured. They are almost orange. You get what you pay for, but like I said I'm sending these back. The plastic was also uncomfortable on the skin. Less like silicone and more like a harder plastic blend."
2.0,"Not a very good fit.  I don't have small ears, but neither do I have gigantic ears, either.  This must be made for a very tiny ear.  Plus it did not come with a fastener for the back of the earring stick."
2.0,"I am 5’4 130lbs and 34D. The bottoms, the let holes were way too large and the stop was so tight around my boobs! There as do say I could wear it!"
2.0,"Meh, you get what you pay for"
2.0,These were too wide for my feet and I did not feel that there was any benefit for the reflexology aspect - I also found them  very uncomfortable.
2.0,I did return these pj’s because I don’t give gifts if I wouldn’t wear them.
2.0,"Made well, but heavy and doesn't fit very well over any of my glass."
2.0,"Came broken, wasn't able to return because apparently it's &#34;one of a kind&#34;."
2.0,The suit seemed really well made but it was just too small. I am a DD so I ordered 2 sizes up from my normal size and it was still too small.
2.0,All of the eye holes are little and the shape doesn’t hold.
2.0,"was really excited to get this in however, the material is heavy and fades and wears so bad after one wash."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this scarf. The color and knit itself are gorgeous, even the sequin detail LOOKS gorgeous. But if you have sensitive skin like me, this is going to bother the crap out of your neck. I found it to be very itchy & pokey, at first i thought it would grow on me, like not bother me as much but it really got more annoying as the night went on. I am returning this scarf for one without sequins."
2.0,We both laughed out loud when we opened the box and looked at this thing.  Really poor quality for a $30 item.  After we purchased thought to check the other reviews on Fakespot and this listing gets a D meaning a lot of the positive reviews are highly questionable.
2.0,This would be a fantastic dress if it wasn't advertised in the wrong size.  This dress is made in China so it doesn't fit one size smaller (as stated in the description) it fits 2-3 sizes smaller than your U.S. size.
2.0,Loved the dress but it came with a hole in the side of the skirt! Be careful when buying from them
2.0,"Product was just what I needed! It's so comfortable and looks great on!  However, after just 2 wears, it is starting to unravel--the crocheting is coming lose."
2.0,Shirt keeps peeling for no reason and thread sticking out the only time I wore it. Poor material. Do not recommend.
2.0,"Broke the first time I tried it, only 1 broke."
2.0,"I ordered an XL that was more like a medium, so gave them away. Didn't fit. Other XL shirts fit fine, but this item ran too small."
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  The medallion part is really cheap looking and the strand with the triangle hangs to the side instead of center & not in a cool, we did that on purpose way."
2.0,Returned. Disappointed in quality of this even though it had good reviews. Pockets were bulging almost pouch like appearance.
2.0,"I’ve ordered a great bra from Yvette, so I had no hesitation buying another.  This one does not match the quality of the black one I bought.  It’s much smaller and I’m sure will not be supportive for the cardio portion of my barre workout.  I’ll need to return it.  I’m very disappointed."
2.0,"The second picture the product shows led me to believe the dog would be easily visible on my face. That was not the case as the dog is too huge to even be seen, plus how low it is on the gaiter."
2.0,"These are cute bracelets and you can't beat the price, but I only wore it a couple times and one of the ropes broke off one side of the clasp so I ended up throwing it away."
2.0,Didn't love. high low cut isn't flattering and the shoulder pads make you look very boxy especially if you are heavy chested. Returned.
2.0,"I ordered 2 packs of these. 1 I received the other I did not. The socks are described as warm, they are not. Much thinner than expected. They are cute, but that's really the only positive I can say."
2.0,No pude usarlo. El size no es correcto y la tela es un engaño.
2.0,"After only 3 months, my leather band snapped. There was only one good size that fit my wrist and the leather did not hold up to the wearage. Shame, because I really liked this watch."
2.0,Small price for the hats. But the hats are very small too and would need an extra inch of material just to fit my head.
2.0,"This looks really cute, but is WAY small!!! For a &#34;one size&#34; it would fit I'd think NO BIGGER than a really tight B cup. The design is cute, and it doesn't even feel that flimsy/cheaply made for being under ten bucks. Final answer? If you're no bigger than a 34B...you MIGHT be able to squeeze into it."
2.0,The magnet clasp broke the first time I wore two of the three.  Don’t waste your money.
2.0,this shirt is a very faded navy.  All the other shirts I have are clear vibrant colors.  Very dissappointed.
2.0,"I get so much pilling from these socks that end up all over the floor. They were pretty good when I first bought them, but after about a year and a half (I rotate them with other socks and only wash them every 7 days of actual use or so) they've developed holes where the ball of the foot is. Not good quality."
2.0,The colors are pretty but the material looked cheap and low quality. Will be returning.
2.0,"Sunglasses run smaller than advertised! Please read description before buying, thank you for ripping me off!<br />Would've looked cute if they weren't so small."
2.0,These fit me poorly and have a tendency to slip off. They are not as good a fit and similar quality to a pair from Academy Sports which I could at least try on first.
2.0,These are super cute but sizes are WAY off. I ordered an xl and the pants fit perfect but the shirt was more like a medium. My husbands xxl didn't even come close to fitting. Order several sizes bigger!
2.0,It didn’t look anything like the posted picture. The material is flimsy & you really get what you paid for. I’m Disappointed with this outfit.
2.0,This was a cute necklace but the chain broke the second day that I wore it. I think I can have my husband fix it with a soldering iron but it would be a hassle for him and he's got enough to fix being a mechanic. Bummed I can't wear it anymore.
2.0,The newer ones I received of this product were too tight and hard to breathe through. Masks are much better.
2.0,"Very basic, no label, no care instructions, fits snug."
2.0,"The pom poms. They look big, soft and fluffy in the pictures. In reality they are poor quality, not soft, short in fur length. No amount of blow drying was going to fluff these up."
2.0,junk like to send it back.
2.0,"Bad desighn on the clip ,almost lost my watch verry flimsy and keeps opening up making my watch fall off all the time .."
2.0,"Not at all what I expected. Large was too tight, and it was navy blue, instead of black like the description said."
2.0,this worked for a few times - get what u pay for
2.0,"Super cheap quality of material,  the seems starting to undone as soon as I wore them."
2.0,"They are cute I returned them I didn’t like how  they fit kinda big on me, the Jean is good material I will say, but I didn’t like they style on me"
2.0,Didn’t like how loose it was
2.0,Materials didn't fit like should
2.0,Ordered 13 and recieved 14.
2.0,It fits just a tiny bit tight and a little shorter than I wanted. The fabric is soft though.
2.0,I bought the 7 1/2 and could not even attempt to zip them up. My daughter tried them too and her foot is narrower than mine. Neither one of us have wide feet.  SO..... this shoe. Runs small as far as circumference. This makes it difficult to zip them up. Order the wide width unless you have a very narrow foot.
2.0,"The thing that I don't like about this shoe for my 8 year old son is that even on the LOOSEST shoe lace setting these shoes are VERY DIFFICULT for him to get on alone.  They are just very tight around the opening where you put your foot in, even at their loosest. When his foot is in the shoe fits well, it is just the squeezing them in each time that he needs help with.  He has a slim foot (not wide) so it is not that they don't fit him.  Just a weird shoe.  I would not recommend these to a friend for that reason."
2.0,Kind of off fit at the shoulder across the chest. Did not like that the key holes were not hemmed
2.0,Colors look faded
2.0,I tried them and they are cute but not waterproof. I may not get soaked while washing dishes but my shirt still gets wet. I learned that if you want waterproof go for latex or plastic. But you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I bought a tan and maroon shirts in XXL.  They fit perfect.  I bought a teal shirt  in XXL and it was huge, maybe a 3x or 4x.  The teal was way bigger then my first 2 shirts.  I returned it and bought a XL in teal.  It was to tight.  I bought a second XXL in teal thinking the first one was mis-sized.  Nope the second teal XXL was huge again way bigger they the first two XXLs I bought.  Quality control is bad.  The sizes vary to much between colors.  I like the shirts but it’s impossible to buy one in teal that fits."
2.0,Sized too small vs regular briefs
2.0,"Looked nice, but too small."
2.0,"I bought this for a present for my parents, they were cute, but the rings broke trying to put them on anything and you can’t really read what they say."
2.0,Irritates my skin and leaves a mark.
2.0,"The elastic band tension is too much that prolonged wearing causes indenting in the bridge of your nose. May want to rethink how to create some elastic tension, perhaps a wider band almost like basketball shorts/underwear or athletic gear."
2.0,"i love diadora, they fit the best for me, but they are starting to separate after only wearing them 5 times. 100$ cleats not enough strong"
2.0,"I read the reviews, they were good. But this pillow is to flat even when inflated completely. It’s uncomfortable and noisy when moved. I would recommend against buying this item"
2.0,"The backs for these earrings came in a plastic bag. When I tried to wear the earring, the hole in the back of the earring was too small to fit the post. The post also bent easily."
2.0,"I chose this suit based on reviews and the picture of the curvy model that was used. I am 5’6”, 150 lbs, and very curvy - this suit did not accommodate my 36Ds. I don’t believe they would accommodate 32Bs - so if you have anything larger than that I would not recommend. The bottom half fit perfectly, but unfortunately this item will be returned."
2.0,"The fit of the outside top is fine; the length is good, goes to my hips, comes up to under my arms. The inside &#34;bralet&#34; is what makes this top suck. It is not, by any means, made for larger breasts. It comes maybe halfway down so you end up with an unsightly elastic lump across the center of your breasts and if you pull it down so the elastic is under your breasts, well that just defeats the purpose of it because your breasts are now hanging out the top, which some people might be ok with, but yeah, not why I bought them. I'm bummed because I liked the colors and they are very soft fabric but I sure cannot wear them. I gave them all to a smaller breasted friend."
2.0,Clasp fell apart just minutes after  delivery and subsequent try-on.
2.0,Set out when received had to glue.
2.0,"Got for my partner, way too small for her. Maybe will fit my 14 year old sister. Will see."
2.0,"Very cute, but turned my neck green after 12 hours of wear. Very dissatisfied."
2.0,The shirt is very pretty but the fabric is see through and not soft at all. This is definitely not a casual shirt. I ended up returning mine because it was such a scratchy fabric.
2.0,"the lens in the right side is too small and pops out constantly. and, the frames are advertised as silver but are actually black. other then that, they would've been nice."
2.0,"The necklace was very cute. My daughter loved it, but the necklace broke the first day. It's cute, but broken."
2.0,Size 30 do is not size 30. Size 30 feels like a 32 or 33 for me and I wear a size 30.
2.0,"I waited quite a while for these, but they are going back. Too thin, too short. Not sure that they are even cotton/linen as there is no label other than the size. I fell for the ""it looks good on the model"" lets try. And - not available anymore, in any color...hmmm."
2.0,after washing them enough times material starts to wear out
2.0,I bought a large and am usually a medium and they were still very small.
2.0,Dress was made too short...not floor length.
2.0,Nice coat but it was too small even though it was a 2X large.
2.0,This shirt is cute the quality is ok but wayyyy to big in size so I suggest size down
2.0,I really wanted this bathing suit to work but unfortunately it was a let down.  If you have a large bust this suit is not for you.  I am a 36DD and ordered a XL.  The band was to big but the cups were very small.  There was too much side boob and front boob.  The back is so low there is no support.  I was hoping this would be cute and hide the tummy I am self conscious about but the boob issue is too much.
2.0,Such a disappointment! Was going to use as a photo booth prop with the White Rabbit hat....UGH! WAAAAAY too small!!!! The glasses will most likely fit a 5yr old. NO ADULTS!
2.0,it arrived Oct 31st and the strap was broken
2.0,Not sure why all the positive reviews. They're a $32.00 boot. You get what you pay for.
2.0,I’m 5’5 and 135lbs and I ordered a Medium. The bottoms were pretty loose on me but if I were to go down a size the top would be too small. The material overall felt kinda cheap. That’s not to say all Zaful suits are like this though. Ordered a different Zaful that I love!
2.0,Shrunk a great deal after washing them in cold water.
2.0,I was disappointed with the fabric<br />Very thin
2.0,"One major area of note.  If you do not have drilled lugs, you cannot remove this bracelet.  Wish I knew that before installed it."
2.0,I just got this item but is wayyyy to long where can I get a smaller one like this bc it looks good but is to long
2.0,"The fabric is wonderful, but the band was far too tight, too tight even for my calf. I'm 5'8"" and 170lbs."
2.0,Didn’t look anything like this. The “coffee” color was a rust color and there was one flat bow that you velcro to the side. Very unimpressed.
2.0,"This was the wrong item. I ordered the lightweight silk gauze and got a heavyweight winter scarf. Also, this was not an authentic scarf.  If you look at the pictures and see how the labeling is done, this scarf does not have Burberry of London on it. Very disturbing."
2.0,"The picture makes it look like the crop is only going to expose a small bit of your stomach but this shirt hardly covered my chest and I am a 34 B. It is basically like wearing a bandeau bra with sleeves,"
2.0,I did not like the material of this item. You must definitely would have to wear cotton underwear so it won't slip off. This item also run small
2.0,"Clasp doesnt close properly. If latch mechanism is hit with some pressure, even slight, your band pops undone. Do not buy, go for a magnetic band.  One positive, it does fit small wrists."
2.0,Cute but lights fade fast
2.0,"I bought this and it was way smaller then i expected, just about the size of a half dollar. Also it's super flowery on back which I wasn't expecting. For you it might be good, but I didn't like it because it wasn't wasn't I thought it was."
2.0,"I liked this enough to keep it,  but it's already pilling after 2 washes and 5 or so wears... so it looks cheap.<br /><br />If you're buying it for the hood definitely don't. The removable hood is heavy and makes the whole shirt pull back so it's choking you in the front. The length is good but it's a little wide....if you're looking for a slim cut, this isn't it!"
2.0,"Lovely bag itself, but the zipper continues to fail me by not properly closing so I can hardly use the bag to travel. Scary to even think about opening the zipper because you won't know how long it will take you to close it again. Rather unfortunate!"
2.0,"The belt buckle has an interesting mechanism. Probably a little too fancy, because it stopped working after a few months."
2.0,Beautiful coat. Had to return. Way too big. Would have been perfect in a medium. I am normally a large
2.0,They are really cute but they just get messed up way too easily. Would not recommend.
2.0,"These shorts run a bit larger than I expected and they did NOT come with a belt.  I ordered 2 pair (different colors) at the same time. The other pair came with a belt, as advertised and it’s a good thing because it’s needed to keep these shorts from falling low, causing the crotch area to chafe when I walk.  So I’m pretty unhappy about not having the accompanying belt for these shorts. This is why I gave it 2 stars.  Otherwise, I would rate these higher."
2.0,"The quality of this is pretty low.  If you're looking for something stupid to wear to a party once then it's fine.  If you're looking for something a bit better, then avoid this."
2.0,"I was disappointed to find that this item was not brand new. It smelled strongly of someone else’s perfume or very fragrant laundry detergent. Also the tag had been cut out and the tag’s white stump remained on the inside seam. Nowhere on the actual garment did it say Capezio or list the size. That aside, it is nice quality and fit well and arrived in time for a costume. I just wish I hadn’t paid full price for “new” when it clearly was worn previously."
2.0,I never wear this.  It's too thick for an under layer and very long.  I look like I'm wearing a bag.  :(
2.0,"The reason why I am giving this item two stars is because My blouse came with some white fabric hanging out of the seams in two places. I was a little disappointed to see that. I took pictures and will share when I can figure out how to add pics to my review. I will have to cut that fabric out really carefully.<br />Ordered this blouse in black. I wear between a large and an XL. I ordered the xl to be safe. Nice and flowy. It was bigger than the reviews led me to believe. Nice and Long in the back, covers my entire bottom. A little shorter in the front. The sleeves are adjustable."
2.0,Nice but fabric way to thin. You can see too much!
2.0,"I bought this for my husbands Birthday. He loved it at first, but it only took a week for the links to start falling apart. The watch is beautiful, but it cost way too much for it to be falling apart. I would not recommend this watch."
2.0,"When I received the bracelet I was very disappointed, it looks very cheaply made, despite the fact that it is sterling silver."
2.0,The gaiter is on the small size.  It does not want to stay on my face and slips down below the chin.  I think I have an average size adult head.  It will be used now as a bandanna or a neck warmer.  The material is a stretchy polyester material.  I like the teal color.
2.0,"I thought the watch was very pretty but the connection snaps are very bad.  First one snap broke, as I was wearing it and when<br />I used the other snap it evidently came undone and I LOST the watch."
2.0,It is not working for me! It is not sticky enough so I had to keep on pressing it and it is uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend it.
2.0,"A little too small and the fabric is that stretchy kind that doesn't breathe. Cute style, but not comfortable."
2.0,"Flimsy, constantly falling off my son's feet."
2.0,These earrings are way too tiny. I wanted small hood but these are just too small; the photo is misleading. They seem like they are designed for a toddler
2.0,The product is as described however the Deathly Hallows symbol is very very dark and it's really not distinguishable when you're wearing the plugs
2.0,"Design was great, and colors were true upon arrival. But after having it for a little while they have begun to fade, and stitching is coming loose @ the point where the neck opens up for the hood, and at the pockets. Not very great quality. I've already had to purchase my child a replacement hoodie, because this one looks janky now and I dont want her walking around in public looking like a slob. Really wish it had held up better. Would not recommend for daily use."
2.0,Dress was to small and the color wasn't white it was closer to ivory.  Up size
2.0,"unless your kid has super long skinny fingers, these aren't going to fit.  my son is 3 and his fingers barely fit due to how skinny the fingers of the gloves are, but his fingers only go half way into the gloves because the fingers are so long."
2.0,Our medium luggage’s wheel broke off the first time we took them out of town! But seems to be a good product!
2.0,not crazy about them
2.0,"Ordered Large in ""grape"" color - not as purple as it looks in the pictures. They are tight enough on my thighs I couldn't go down to a medium, but the waist is pretty loose. It appears the pocket will stretch out fairly quickly.  I have worn and washed them only once - and the color went from a muted grape to a gross grayish blah.  I needed pants badly enough that I'll keep them, but won't order these again."
2.0,"The shirt was a little small, but pretty close to the sizing described. It was poor quality and the print/design is really off centered."
2.0,Kind of disappointed. They are very see threw and don't work well without another pair of leggings under them. Was hoping they weren't as  see threw.
2.0,Fabric looks and feels good.  Just doesn't fit like the product looks.
2.0,"Like the fact that they were 80% cotton, but that's  about all. Unfortunately these socks were not made for an adult woman shoe size 9. I have very sensitive feet, and the  fit is extremely tight with no wiggle room for ones toes.  These will be going to Good Will."
2.0,The necklace is very pretty but the chain is too short for my neck. I thought it extended to 18” but if it did then it would fit. Kinda disappointed and will probably just give it to my daughter.
2.0,These were so small when they arrived! The sizing is a little off I think
2.0,Too small at the band and my cups overfloweth. I ordered a cup size up. Quality was nice though. I am sad it didn’t fit.
2.0,"These earrings are very pretty and I was excited to get them. Two of the pairs were fine but the other pair came in moldy. I tried just wiping it clean, but the mold grew back a few weeks later. I LOVE the non-moldy ones, but unfortunately that means I can only wear 2 out of 3 pairs."
2.0,"Bought the black and blue. Black was too small and didnt cover my whole booty. If I bent over, I looked like a plumber. The waistline stitching wasn't very comfy either. The blue was perfect."
2.0,"I'm a size 7/8 I ordered a Large, and the body suit is still too small for me. It's tight fit, so for comfort you should order a size up.  I would have exchange for a larger size, unfortunate Large is the largest size.<br />I think I will need to cut the bottom so its no longer a body suit if I plan to wear this top. Money wasted.<br />I love the snack color."
2.0,It looks good and worked good for about a week before it started to come apart. Not durable at all.<br />Great Slot for air tag that slot seems sturdy.
2.0,Cute but made for a child. Broke easily
2.0,I think the picture of the dress that's advertised is stuck in that position. It doesn't move in real life because it's made out of curtain and potato sack. Maybe it's better if you wash it? I sent it back.
2.0,They fit fine just a half inch too small for someone who has wide feet at size 11.  But the heel is too big I fell twice
2.0,Very boxy unflattering
2.0,Super cute BUT Left stain on the back of my neck after a concert.
2.0,it broke the second time i worn it pretty but not good quality
2.0,"The photo shows three lines of text.  My text was two words, one admittedly long, but both appear on one line making the text too small to read.  The mask itself is small - more suited for 13 years of age and under."
2.0,"The earrings are cute, but are not clip earrings they are regular earrings w butterfly back. They are a little larger than regular clip earrings. Additionally the clips did not work. They were broken."
2.0,need a better way to size them needs to be a stretchier material.
2.0,Not great quality and already tarnishing.
2.0,"The jacket is very small, I would go with a size or 2 bigger than you normally wear. I wear an XL and got a 2XL which was too tight. Otherwise, very cute and made well!"
2.0,Definitely did not fit as expected. Too big.
2.0,"I still have a Speidel twistoflex on one of my watches from the 70's.  Looks and works great.  Really wanted one for my Apple Watch 5, 44mm.  I ordered  the black one from Speidel not Amazon, since Amazon did not carry the small size.  I live in Virginia. The first watch was shipped somewhere to Seattle, Wa.  ( Black watchbands matter?).  I did receive the second more quickly than whoever got the first one, as that one took three weeks. A few issues with the watch.  I have a 7 inch wrist.  I ordered small.  As you can see from the photo, apparently not small enough. So , I would guess for the 44mm these run large.  On their website they do show you how to remove the links if you feel brave, and have some time. However it is a very complicated procedure. Second big issue is if you look at the side of the band the top link ends are black and the bottom are silver.  But in their photo, it  doesn't appear that way.  All the links on the end are black.  IT kind of bothers me as this is very visible as you can tell from the photo.  How tough just to paint the entire band.  I contacted Speidel and they said that was customer preference.  Really???  Also when the watch band expands the silver is visible between the links.  If I had a stainless watch or aluminum one, I'd keep this band.  For black.. uh, no.."
2.0,I love the material of this dress but there is absolutely no lining underneath you could see right through the dress.
2.0,They fit good but the zipper broke the 2nd time I wore them. Had them to long to return. Would never buy another pair of this brand.
2.0,"Stitching quality was poor.  There was a run on the back of the collar.  I returned it because of that but also the stitching on under the arm had a long piece of yarn just sticking under there.  I would have returned it for another one, but I felt like it would not last long.  Went a bought another sweater elsewhere."
2.0,"I normally take an xl size sweatshirt.  Reading the reviews of this product, I was led to believe that it is a quality product with sizing problems. A vast majority of the reviewers said that not only are these shirts larger than stated by size; they are larger by 2 to 3 times.  So instead of ordering a xl, I ordered a medium.  Well I barely got it on. And the strange part was that although the body of the sweatshirt was too tight, the armholes were for a size 2x (a size I wore for years).  The outcome is a shirt that looked really tight with sleeves for a 3x size.  So even if you get the correct body size, you'll notice that the arm opening and the length of the sleeve is for a big, tall person.  Consequently I had to ship them back."
2.0,Was not good in person.
2.0,Cheaply made regular sunglasses. Not “HD Yellow” lenses for night driving as described. Just low quality sunglasses.
2.0,"Took forever to get.  The package was torn open, USPS thankfully put it in another clear bag. It runs super small. I ordered a 5x and it is tight. The fabric is very thin and holds wrinkles."
2.0,It is frayed at the bottom pretty badly and is basically completely see through. Order up two sizes and know that you will need to wear some kind of slip type thing if you don't want your undergarments showing. I will keep because it was so inexpensive and I am trying to find a way to wear it in public but for now its just used as a sexy lounge around the house pjs. I had to cut a lot of the fray off as it looked a hot mess. I honestly wouldn't bother with this
2.0,followed guidelines and other suggestions based on height and weight...but it still ended up too big.
2.0,Pockets are too tight. More than one credit card in a pocket is very difficult to pull out.
2.0,"I had high hopes b/c I liked the pattern & style. However, it got returned. Pattern didn’t match up on the sides, flimsier fabric than I anticipated & the inside of the black dress is white which stands out when walking or sitting."
2.0,I thought this has enough lights for both wheels and frame. The photo is extremely misleading. I also don't understand and it wasn't clear how you could put them on the wheel. The lights were bright and worked well and we were just able to wrap around the body frame of the bike.
2.0,Size and fitting was so off on both dressed that I purchase.
2.0,suppose to be XL must have been a kid size or JR
2.0,I have a 5 year old that I bought these for and they are definitely not worth it.  They are hard to fit over his head and the earloops dont line up.  They squeeze his ears forward and are very long.  My aunt purchased similar ones and they were great but I was unable to find the same ones and regret purchasing these.<br />May be able to use them without the earloops but for my 5 year old I was looking for something simple.
2.0,"When new they look good but then you put them on, they are very thin. If comparable Wilson headband can hold 2-3 matches, this one is not enough for one match.<br />It is too thin.<br />It is soft and looks good, but after wash it becomes drab."
2.0,Thought these would be acrylic. I believe they’re all stainless steel.
2.0,"These moccasins are really adorable but the quality is less than desired. If you just need some mocs for photos or an event, these come at a great price, but don't expect them to last.<br /><br />My one year old literally bit a hole into the toe, and it look little effort! The fringe is tearing off and ripping with just a few wears. The inside sole comes out every time you take them off. I obviously should have known with the price, I suppose my expectations were too high."
2.0,Very cheap material but you get what you paid for!
2.0,"I thought this would look more gold but it has a more vintage rust look to it. Not what I wanted, might return."
2.0,"I had a problem with the lens falling out, and got tired of re-inserting them."
2.0,"Purchased these shorts in the past fit perfectly, recent purchase ‘same size’ were smaller and material seemed different return is an option."
2.0,I ordered a few for a wedding party. The sizing was way off. Runs super big.
2.0,"The product fits well and has a great quality look, however when opening the package there was this strong smell. The smell irritates the eyes. I've washed this sweater twice(btw, no tags or washing labels on this product). The smell of some type of chemical is still strong. I've hung this up in the closet and the whole closet smells. I have no idea what it is but it continues to give a very strong and irritating scent. After a couple washes and dryer sheets, I finally tried to wear it. Eyes burn and skin feels itchy even with a shirt on underneath it."
2.0,Cardigan came all bunched up in package.<br />It appears not as described on Amazon.<br />Appears only for very casual wear.
2.0,"Looks fine, works fine, metal parts are not titanium or hypoallergenic, nickel-free stainless, so I'm having to throw mine away after one month of increasing irritation and rash and buy a competing brand. The OEM served me fine for over a year, but $60 + $20 shipping is absurd, so I'm stuck with knock off."
2.0,Black paint started chipping off after 2 wears. looks good when the light hits it right.
2.0,"For the price, I suppose I could not ask for better quality.It looks very pretty until you put it on. I felt the material was rather poor quality and did not maintain color, print, or overall structure around the waste band and it is not particularly tight. The skirt is nowhere as full as it is pictured. One of the pockets had a hole in it. I do not think I would order it again."
2.0,The back has a weird slit in it and the arms are huge and shapeless. Sad it ended up being so sack like because the pattern was cute and it was really soft. I sized down also.
2.0,"The sunglasses are cheaply made. They are lightweight and the style is good. But the quality is real bad and they are not very comfortable to wear. For Instagram photos yes, for daily wear no!"
2.0,The material is really cheap and didn't look nice when I tried it on. While the photo looks great; it doesn't look as great in person. Also the material for the skirt is really stiff and uncomfortable​.
2.0,It doesn’t look anything like the pictures. The color is very yellowy and doesn’t have much sparkle/shine. It looks more like a shell type shirt than a cute tank top.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:9f9d81f14b4ee6aa5aecc5a85ca298c]] this looks a feels like a low quality polyester shirt and it Is yellow. The images on the shirt are juvenile and there is a lot of fabric folded over behind the button panels. It ran small in our household. it might be good for a young person for summer fun but I have a hard time knowing what anyone's taste would be. I think if it were white I would like it better but the light yellow background diminishes it.
2.0,"It is a warm product, but as you move, it keep going down and does not hold the ears."
2.0,"I like the design of these, but I spend half the time I'm wearing them picking at them because they ride up so far."
2.0,To tight on ears and face. Sizing is wrong. Would describe as a Medium not a Large
2.0,I I like the style but the quality is cheap
2.0,"Ordered this ""new"" watch, and it came ""used"" with the band already resized and with the wrong movement. Description says a Seiko NH35, but watch arrived with a different movement with no hacking and a wobble in the second hand. Rotating bezel was slightly misaligned. Shame as it was an otherwise beautiful piece. Even at this price, the quality control is really lacking."
2.0,"I normally wear large in dresses ,so I ordered an Extra Large.  I could not even get my arms in the sleeves.  Cut way too small.  Will be returning."
2.0,Runs smaller than the size you order. Couldn’t wear.
2.0,Couldn't put the pants on without taking off my work boots.  Good set of work rain pants should do that.
2.0,Material does not flow like it appears in the ad.
2.0,best for 50 + age
2.0,"At first I was mildly happy with it, since it seemed it would do the job.  I have a 35 lb. Husky and the excess belly strap was so long it touched the ground.  I wish I could have cinched it a little tighter, but that was the tightest it went.  Before we even left for our trip, the very light duty zipper malfunctioned and became open on both sides.  I was able to fix it but the same thing happened again on the trail, and I had to safety-pin it closed.  There is no under-tail strap, and maybe it would have helped, because 30 minutes after fixing the thing with safety pins the dog emerged from a diversion off the trail without his pack.  We had been calling for him for 10 minutes.  I imagine he got the pack stuck on the brush/tree branches and wriggled out of it.  I was glad he was able to escape, but frustrated that the $50 worth of pack and contents were not to be found.<br /><br />In summary, if you have a calm dog that stays right on the trail with you or is always on a leash, then a pack is a great idea.  Not for my young Husky, however.  He hasn't had much experience with leashes, so he still pulls like a son-of-a-gun, leaving your arms sore.  If he is off leash, the risk of him getting caught up isn't worth it.  A good pack should have heavy duty zippers and a third strap besides the chest and belly strap."
2.0,Flowy dress but sub par material. Returned because of material. Would not wear to a formal event. More like a summer dress to wear to a winery or dinner.
2.0,The listing shows a top in ALL the photos!  NO top includes!  Misleading!!!
2.0,Too large. Hard to give Orthopaedic shoes as a gift without trying them first. I'm sure the product is fine.
2.0,Really lovedthe loon but the heel is super unstable so it forced you to use the balls of your feet only. the heel just was not under my foot.
2.0,We put it on our dog because it won't fit my daughter.
2.0,The shine on this snap did not last two weeks. Disappointing in this one.
2.0,I thought the doll with bathrobe was included as shown in add. False advertising. Very disappointed.<br />Never would have paid $23.00 for a little girls bathrobe
2.0,They run large for size and I need a bit more arch or heel.  If you love flat sandals you will love them!
2.0,By the picture I expected some type of shiny material.  They were not and they were on the smaller side.
2.0,To long. Didn't care for the material.
2.0,The idea is fun but doesn't work well unless your ear is tiny...
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these. Both Medium, one in black and one in white. They are completely different! I am 5'7 135lbs. e black one is made small. It seems like it is made for women with short torsos. If I put my arms up it shows my belly and that's not what I wanted it for. The white is big on me. If I put my arms up the top slides down past my chest. I will keep them both since they weren't that expensive. I like the material. I am going to try and shrink the white."
2.0,The color cane of within three days
2.0,Quality not as good as I had hoped. Flimsy
2.0,"There are hooks on the sides of the mask, but if you don't use a disposable mask, there is nothing to hook to, and the mask moves around.  I found it to be cumbersome and touched my face more to keep it in place."
2.0,Meh…
2.0,"Extremely flimsy, and unappealing. Was hoping for a cute hula-lilo and stitch vibe. Instead I look like a knockoff hula doll"
2.0,"it’s a nice set. It looked beautiful and complemented my outfit. My low review is more so for the necklace. Horrible. Extremely cheap, yea I get it you’ll get what you pay for but this was crazy. The chain popped fresh out the pack. I was able to wear it w|o it but it cut my skin so crazy. It still hurts. Overall very cute though lol"
2.0,"I didn't even put it in the dryer and it shrunk right after wash. It's small like child size, I'm unable to wear it. Poor Poor quality for the price I paid, I do not recommend!"
2.0,"I own this dress in several colors and they're a nice thick fabric. The purple dress was much thinner and a very different color than pictured, very bright."
2.0,It is great but dosent open and the lights don't work uts kinda sad and upsetting.
2.0,The underside of the ruffle was white and showed when wearing it.  Made it look cheap. Also a little too cheeky for my taste.  Returning
2.0,It’s soft but too small.
2.0,"Although it is pretty cute, it’s not really like what’s shown in the photo. First, it’s way bigger in person than I expected. And second, it didn’t come in the little inspirational packaging I thought it would. It was/is supposed to be a gift and the packaging was one of the reasons I got it."
2.0,I like this well enough and my son likes them but they grip material on the palm of one of the gloves is already coming off the glove and he’s only had them for a few weeks so that’s an issue.
2.0,I purchased a medium in this for my son who is a tall thin 14 year old. The colors and print were great but it fit much more tightly than he prefers. It wasn't necessarily too tight but it is definitely a more slim cut. It is also VERY thin. As in you can see through it when held up to a light thin. If you are aware of the sizing and fabric this may be exactly what you are looking for but we returned it.
2.0,Cheap!!!!!!.
2.0,"These are great disposable pants! However, if you want something that lasts longer than a month, keep looking.<br /><br />I love the way they look and fit. However, they are so cheaply made they literally start coming apart at the seams. At first, I thought it was how I was caring for them. I bought THREE of these, dry cleaned them even & they are still coming apart. I constantly have to pull the hanging elastic threads out of the seams and the material gets ruined. I wish they were made better because they look good but I’m not wasting my money anymore on these cheap pants."
2.0,This fit more like a medium.  I am returning it because it is tighter than I like.  I recommend getting 1 size larger than your normal size.
2.0,"Nice shorts. Just need to order 2 sizes larger, I ordered 1 size larger and there was no difference,  the shorts are well made though."
2.0,"After about 1 year of use, a simple dip in a pool was enough to allow water in and ruin the LCD screen."
2.0,Very beautiful but it came damaged and 3 of the stones had fallen off.
2.0,"The fabric isn’t bad, maybe a little thin, but the top is just a piece of fabric with halter straps. No elastic or bra-like cups to hold it down. One puff of wind and you would flash everyone. Will probably try to sew in a strapless bra or something."
2.0,"No cumple con lo prometido, poner esas medias es súper difícil"
2.0,"Beautiful color as shown, but the hat has a different shape than the image that appears on the website.  I will never wear it."
2.0,I didn't like the fit across the chest arms and back. I'm returning.
2.0,Wrinkles and cheap fabric. Would not buy again
2.0,Too simple
2.0,Very uncomfortable while sleeping for me.
2.0,I bought it for my best friend and it was way too small for her on the largest size! It wasn’t even good quality.
2.0,"These waist beads are ok. You get what you pay for. The beads are small and the elastic used is not a heavy quality elastic for waist beads. I have had several and I would recommend if this is your first time and you just want to try, buy it. Otherwise go with a better quality bead and elastic. Will not purchase again."
2.0,"Beautiful,  but hard to put on..."
2.0,"Cute idea, but way too small."
2.0,Lithe material is very cheap other than that it's a pretty deess
2.0,I was hoping this would be a good purse. The inside zipper is already fraying and gets caught when trying to open and close. Have only used it a little over a month. I like the size. The quality not so much.
2.0,Very small not what I expected..
2.0,"I thought I was ordering four 18mm rings but only got one 18mm ring. Every other size was four to a pack, it shows four in the picture. Went back and read everything and in the fine print, it says that the 18mm was the only one that was a single.<br /><br />It doesn't work for the purpose I needed them for, because I needed four. Maybe I will use the single one to hold cables together."
2.0,"I own the green floral dress in another print,& decided to buy a red one.The first one was cheap & flimsy,I did wear it once,but not much.I thought it was just the material of that particular dress,but no.I just ordered the red one that looked so cute online,but sadly it's made of the same material,cheap & flimsy just like the first.Shame because the cuts & prints are so cute,just very very cheap material.Won't buy again."
2.0,"The fit was as expected and I really wanted to like it. However the picture provided did not represent the truth of the fabric. It looks very well used with pilling all over. It doesn't look like a new garment, rather something found in a thrift store. Very disappointing."
2.0,"It's a nice small wallet.  My only complaint (sorry) is the smell.  It smells like chemicals.  Hope that goes away,"
2.0,They don’t look anything like the picture they look picture than in person I worn them once and will only wear them once in a while since not a fan
2.0,"This shoe digs into my grand daughter's heels so badly, she couldn't take more that 5 steps."
2.0,"Worked great for 2 months.<br />Now  one shoe half the lights only work.<br />But , one month warranty."
2.0,I bought Medium which is what I usually wear in sports bras. I am a 36 C.<br />This was so hard to put on and it was very tight. I only tried it on and never wore it again. The struggle to put it on is too much.
2.0,These are tights not leggings!
2.0,"When it came to band part of the hat (where the visor is), it fit so tight I felt like I was going to faint. Because it was so tight there, the baggy part of the hat (top part) it looked way too big."
2.0,":( I have thick calves, but not abnormally huge....and despite ordering the largest pair, I struggled to get these on"
2.0,"The leather feels good and of good quality. However the threading seems like cheap threading. At the lugs, the threading was starting to come up off the leather. Has great quick release springs bars which work great. Sadly I did return it because the threading was starting to look cheap."
2.0,The Buckle keeps coming unclasp
2.0,This shirt looks cheap in real life. The quality is thin and transparent. It was very cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,No<br />Too big
2.0,"I am really disappointed in these, they look comfy and cozy but they run so small in the height part of pushing your foot in, I really had a struggle, then they were not comfortable because they were so tight.  I honestly had no idea that there was a memory foam padding on the foot bed, I personally did not feel it with my feet or my hands.  Also when I hear pink, I think something is going to be pink, these at best were tan...no pink here! They will be donated maybe someone with a much smaller foot will like these."
2.0,"I love the outside of the mask and the Tigger picture.  I also liked that you are able to adjust the ear loops.  I did not like the inside material, it is irritating to my nose.  (It caused my nose to itch).  I washed it and hoped that it would help to resolve this, but unfortunately it did not."
2.0,The color does not match the photo. The dress in the pic looks plum to me but the dress is a dark red.
2.0,"Very flimsy, and was afraid it was going to break when I was wearing it."
2.0,"Very pretty, but made of the cheapest metal. I usually have no issues with earrings but I had an alergic reaction to the metal in these."
2.0,"I ordered this one weeks ago and didn't look very closely when it arrived, but I took a closer look when I wrapped it for my wife last night and I was pretty disappointed. It just looks so cheap.<br /><br />I'm no psychic, but I predict this will sit at the back of her closet for a while, and then it will go in the Donate pile when the weather warms up. And I won't even blame her. The sooner she donates this, the sooner she forgets that I gave it to her."
2.0,My son is proud of his coon and wears it everyday.  This gift is better to put medal in holder just for looks.  Not durable to wear daily
2.0,When I received these glasses they reminded me of the 3D theatre glasses. I also don’t think they’re super comfortable. If I saw them at the store I’m not sure I would have bought them even if they were only $5.
2.0,"Runs very small!,"
2.0,"I would describe this hat as just ""okay"",  The hat itself is made of a lightweight, soft material.  It actually fits good on my head itself.  The problem is that the brim in the front of the hat hangs down so low over my forehead that it blocks my vision.  If I am looking straightforward...the brim actually goes lower than my eyes.....so in order to see, I have to lift my entire face upwards.  The brim itself is a soft material.... so I can't just fold it up and get it to stay in a higher  position.  I tried putting the hat on with the bow in the front and the back and it hangs too low and blocks my eyes in both positions.  Considering I can't see with my head in a normal forward position.....the hat itself would not work for me.  I did try pushing the hat back real far on my head so I could see better....but then it looks sort of like a bonnet, which is not attractive.  The low hanging brim in the front might not be a problem for those with a longer facial structure....however the brim from all angles was just to long and floppy.  It is a cute hat with the bow....but a hat won't do me much good if I can't see while wearing it."
2.0,"These are nice and arrived fairly quickly, however they are really large bot the lenses as well as the fit- they are way too wide for my head."
2.0,"The bottoms were perfect!!!!! I have a bubble butt, about a size 8 in jeans/shorts and ordered a large. Talk about some perfect coverage!!!<br /><br />However… because you have to buy a set of L/L… i’m only a 34C up top, so the top was massive. The cups are weird and pointy, gives off an 80’s vibe. If you have lots of junk in the trunk but not a lot up top, think twice. If they sold the bottoms alone, i’d be buying more in more styles!"
2.0,The only good thing about this hat is the print of the fabric. The overall shape of the hat and it's proportions are very awkward.
2.0,"Sorry to report that although the bra is comfortable, it rides up  to where the cup is halfway on my beasts. I'm a B cup, so I don't fall out, but I'm constantly pulling the bra dowsee<br /><br />I was really looking for  Daily wear comfort."
2.0,Broke same day.
2.0,Material very thin.
2.0,The material is very nice but the cut was far shorter than the picture and they ride up on your legs the first time you go from sitting to standing.
2.0,looks great but it's flimsy and very thin
2.0,These jeans are super cute!!! But..... they run super small I order a size 11 and they fit my sister who is a size 3 in jeans!<br />So sad they didn't fit. Will be returning them
2.0,"This should be advertised as lingerie instead of a swimsuit. It's not swimsuit material, but rather the thin material of a camisole tank.<br />However, it makes a cute leotard to wear with jeans or a skirt, with a sweater or blazer over it."
2.0,Shoulders/Sleeves were too tight. Could not even out it on
2.0,"I've had it for two months or so, and the seams on the inside of the wallet are falling apart. It seemed like good quality material, but it doesn't stand up against time."
2.0,"First off the anklet does have good bling.<br />The problem is the bracelet is far too big to be an anklet. I bought it for my wife and it just falls down to her foot.  The elastic should be tight enough to have it stay on her ankle.<br />She has a normal size ankle she is not a twig but she doesn't have cankles either.<br />If this would fit right it would be 5 stars for the price.<br />I read other reviews that said it was too tight, wondering how big the are."
2.0,Too thin. See through
2.0,I am 5ft 5in 132 pounds. This was a horrible fit. The shorts fit well tge top part was very droopy way too big I would have to get it altered. Bought to go on vacation but now looking for another item wouldn't evendors wear this around the house
2.0,"Cheap material, washes bad."
2.0,"Very light and breathable, but you spend all your time pulling it up"
2.0,"I love nato/zulu bands, and find the nylon way more comfortable than the rubber bands. I really liked this and wanted to give it 5 stars. The problem is, the strap kept popping off. The nylon part of the band is held to the garmin quick fit clasps with simple watch pins. Three times, these pins popped out, and the watch fell off my wrist. I work as a dive instructor, so I may be a bit harder on this than the average user. But the final straw was when I was getting out of my car, and it just dropped off my wrist for no reason. It's just too unreliable. I can't afford to lose my $1,000 watch down the main wall when it pops off my wrist underwater. I can't recomend this.<br /><br />Back to the standard rubber for me. :-("
2.0,"I ordered this ring as a gift for someone. I wasn’t going to open the plastic bag the box and the polishing cloth came in but I’m so glad I did. This thing was SO TARNISHED. It looked like an old piece of jewelry someone had sitting in their jewelry box for a long time. The ring had fingerprints on it and it looked really used. I tried to use the polishing cloth and it didn’t really do anything. The ring looks and feels cheap. So disappointed with this purchase. Also, the stone does not look like what was advertised. I don’t recommend this product."
2.0,It was far lower quality than expected.
2.0,One of the rings were broken
2.0,"It was a great belt for the couple months I used it ,the spring popped out and made the belts useless"
2.0,Pretty easy to use but it left a film on my glasses and the anti fog effect did not last very long. I hate that it didn't work for me.
2.0,I like the shirt light weight and comfort but was to small so order about 2 sizes bigger then what you would wear
2.0,I loved the hats but they are sized wrong.  They were way too small.
2.0,"These compression shorts are very light weight (so they will be form fitting) and easy to move around in. The elastic band isn’t constricting at all. It allows for more movement at the waist. I’m a woman so, of course the dimensions are a little off but I like the length and where they rest on my thighs. I ordered the red ones, they’re actually maroon.<br /><br />One small thing, a tiny hole formed in the crotch area the same day I received and tried them on after a full yoga spread. Must’ve been made too quickly or with cheap material."
2.0,"Black Flare Pattern: It is hard to see in the photos, but the black print pattern has a flare on the sleeves.  This isn't my style so I returned it, but otherwise the fabric was nice and the fit was fine, but a little on the large side. 3 stars (mainly due to style preference)<br /><br />Flag Pattern: The fabric on this is terrible.  It looks like a cheap reproduction of the pictured fabric.  It is one-sided so looks weird when it drapes open because the inside is white but slightly see through to the pattern on the other side. It also has a very weird fit where the bottom is very tapered so not a good fit for anyone with hips. 1 star"
2.0,Looks cheap. Not impressed. The slimness of the tie was accurate.
2.0,"True to size but not impressed by the material, kind of light and shiny. Not exactly what I expected. I should have orderered medium instead of large as I wear size 10 for my tops. A little poorly made too. Other than that, still in love with the picture..."
2.0,the belt has started peeling already. has not be used frequently either.<br />nice design and idea. nice buckle. would not recommend because of bad quality
2.0,"The picture is deceptive. My wife bought this because she wanted another fitted running shirt. The picture makes it seem fitted; however, the shirt is actually cut like a square. If you have an hourglass shape, this shirt is not for you. The material quality is nice though."
2.0,"QUESTIONING HOW SHORT THE MODELS IN THE PHOTOS ARE? They must be under 4' 8&#34; to be able to wear these. Also, god bless them, they must have 22 inch waists to have the flowers so close."
2.0,"Everything was fine, except the center stone is very dark... Almost black. I purchased this specifically for the bright blue center stone that's in the photo."
2.0,I ordered smoke blue lenses and received dark smoke lenses. Not worth hassle of trying to return. Quality is as expected for $6.49.
2.0,The product itself seems very durable and sturdy. My issue is the pictures as well as the description show a water bottle holder on the side and the item I received has no water bottle holder anywhere. I’m returning.
2.0,This is a very pretty bracelet. Unfortunately the T toggle end fell off after a day of wearing it and got lost :-(
2.0,Its unlined and does not hang well on my body.<br />It looks cheap. I returned it.
2.0,Got this as a replacement for my worn out comfort click belt because it was the same ratchet style belt. The problem is the buckle. It doesn't really grip firmly to the end of the belt and has a tendency to come loose.
2.0,One chain was received with the clasp already broken and the other two lasted only one day of wear. They both separated from the piece that was holding it together as I was trying to fix the position of the clasp toward the back.
2.0,It fit just fine but it's so thin! The material is incredibly rough.
2.0,"shows a fuschia pink color and comes as a much lighter pink.  is neon, just not the neon color shown. runs large"
2.0,"Loved the bracelet gave as a gift, ended up breaking in less than a month ):"
2.0,The shirt is not true to size. I ordered a size up and it was still to small.
2.0,Horriable fabric unless you like shiney.  Would be fine if this fabric was not used
2.0,These glasses have metal pieces where it sits on your nose and I broke out/got burnt from them. Absolutely awful! they are very cute on but DEFINITELY not worth the burns!!!!
2.0,"Even though I ordered a size larger than I usually wear, the pants are way too small."
2.0,Purchased this as a gift for someone that normally wears XL and it was extremely small. Would have to purchase 1 to maybe 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear for it to fit.
2.0,"Loved these, super cute but does not hang in ears as pictured. They slide all the way down, a backing must be put on the end or it will fall out. Can not move the backing up the chain to keep them in place. Very disappointed i had to return them."
2.0,Way too small and made of cheap products that chafe and sit uncomfortably. I returned these but I wouldn’t buy them again even in a bigger size.
2.0,"Chain is much shorter than described.  Although the heart is quite tiny it is cute, but the chain being so short and cheaply made makes this necklace not worth the $24.99 price.  After initial purchase, the price then went up to $49.99.  This is a rip off for cheap jewelry....be warned it is definitely Not worth the original price and way too expensive at $50!"
2.0,The waist line is too high on these for a summer cool down.
2.0,The way it crushed easily is the only drawback
2.0,"This is a good looking watch, the construction materials are fairly cheap though. When I peeled the protective plastic film off of the watch face, it peeled up the &#34;Units Per Hour&#34; piece that borders the glass (see pictures). It appears that it is a thin piece of metal that was poorly glued to the watch body. Like I said, it's a good looking watch, but poorly made.<br /><br />I would not recommend this watch."
2.0,Comfortable pretty looking sunflower socks
2.0,Material faded to very light green within two weeks. Is already fraying badly. I will not order from them again.
2.0,It was missing a diamond and it broke on the 1st day
2.0,Poor quality. Haven't worn it and there are frayed threads at the seams. Also fits oddly. Will likely return.
2.0,Broken clasps on each pair of earrings
2.0,The flies fall down a lot !
2.0,The pants were way too big and poofy and of cheap quality the only thing used was the shirt
2.0,This fabric is pretty cheap. It’s also short in the torso. I ordered a Medium am 5’7” and 140 lbs.
2.0,I kept seeing all these reviews about good quality..  No. This is horrible quality and is see through. It does not cover the whole body and you can't wrap it around unless you are about a siz 10 or smaller. I'm not happy but it could still be useful for Halloween. It should be $10 not $30. Feels very cheap and thin.
2.0,Screw fell out that holds the ear piece on the second time I wore them
2.0,I may send it back not comfy and too small
2.0,Very pretty but broke when I took it out
2.0,I’m disappointed with the necklace. I’ve worn it once or twice but it just appears “dull”.
2.0,Tree fell out and chain broke right away.
2.0,"My ID and debit card fell out while they were in this, while I was wearing it. It's not at all secure, which is what I personally expected."
2.0,"The pants are very cute, casual, soft fabric. I'm 5'9&#34; and ~150lbs and based on the sizing chart (I'm bottom heavy, appx a size 6/8) ordered a medium. They were WAY too small and bc they were too tight up top, they were also too short. Returning."
2.0,"Normally I wear an XL, I sized up to an XXL and it was still too small. The XXL fit like a L.<br />The fabric was slinky and soft. If it fit, it would have been a nice shirt."
2.0,"I found the sweater too bulky in the middle and too long, which is totally different from the advertised picture. If you have a T shape frame this is not going to look slim fitted. The material and overall style is nice, I normally wear large and generally I get a good fit, it's just the fit of this sweater didn't work for me."
2.0,"I guess I should have read the description better but this thing is super tiny, it’s coin sized and not at all what I was expecting. It’s cute but I’m sorry I bought it."
2.0,The lenses came scratched and the frames are very loose.  These appear to be a pair of seconds
2.0,"Such a cute bowtie perfect for Easter!!  Unfortunately, it would not stay on not matter what we tried.  Sad diasappointment."
2.0,This says plastic flexible barbells and shows the whole thing glowing. I received 6 barbells correct colors but the bar itself isn't plastic or glow in the dark
2.0,Arrived bent and unusable. Too bad as it is very pretty.
2.0,"I got the &#34;color: Navy_yellow&#34;<br /><br />Color & Cut: If you look at the picture it has a clear yellow pattern going down the middle. Mine had only an inch of it in the top part and the bottom part had zero yellow. Color is also off, from what I can see of the yellow its more mustard (which I actually liked more) than pastel yellow as pictured & its more black every where else than navy (which I don't like).<br /><br />Feel: very soft and nice, but much fuller and heavier than I thought it would be.<br /><br />Shoulders: were really made me return this. They puffed up like I had shoulder pads or something. Not flattering!<br /><br />Buttons: so freaking cute and easy to button.<br /><br />Size: I'm either a medium or large and I went with the medium, it had the buttons pulling very slightly in the bust. But I think if I went up a size it would just be too big elsewhere and add additional fabric weight."
2.0,"The color in the picture is red, but in reality it is red-orange.  I have learned from this experience that if you want a shirt that is red, you have to order &#34;deep red&#34;.  I am returning the shirt as soon as my caregiver's car is fixed."
2.0,The neck is stretched out.
2.0,My husband gave me this for Valentine's day and it broke as soon as it put it on.  Terrible. quality. Cheap.
2.0,"The colors are vibrant and beautiful. The material is soft enough. But this thing is more like a sweater bra. I'm a member of the IBTC, so large breasts aren't the reason this top stops about an inch below them. It's beautiful, but really, really short."
2.0,"So sad, guys. This is seriously the cutest shirt, but I've never received something that looked closer to falling apart. Even the button holes were fraying before I ever wore it. Gotta send it back."
2.0,Cute Skirt - But VERY small.  Ordered XLG and could not buckle any of the closures past the waist.  This was for my niece ho is usually a medium at best.
2.0,"The size and style are perfect. The silver pair was not broken and works great. However, the rose gold pair had a clasp that broke as soon as I tried to open it. Waste of a pair."
2.0,I love Calvin Klein and have a few Blazers but the 18W was way too wide for me.  lots of space.  love the color. may have to take it to the cleaners to get it sucked in or tailored.
2.0,But donated it
2.0,Far from true to size. Brought a large which fit more like a small.
2.0,Fit is fine.  Inside stiching is very scratchy.  Returned
2.0,"Unfortunately, material is not great quality...."
2.0,2 stones are missing.
2.0,Used once and a seam tore where the pads are placed.
2.0,Why if they are &#34;one size fits all&#34; are they made to fit a very small foot?
2.0,Picture shows these are red. They look very pink.
2.0,The shirt fit great but the shorts DID NOT come with it. I will be figuring out how to either get them or it will all get sent back.
2.0,"I loved the feeling and fit of this band,  unfortunately it was only 6 weeks until it busted. The clasp part stayed locked into my watch but the band broke. I am pretty bummed.  Guess I need to look for a better quality one"
2.0,"Cheap fabric... not the same flattering cut as shown. The bodice is too short and the ribbon belt is too thin to look like the photo. These types of dresses almost always look good on me, but this one just wasn’t good sadly."
2.0,My biggest complaint is they are too short. They fall down and liquid I am trying to use get on my wrist.
2.0,"I ordered these earrings they were beautiful and now around the diamonds they are green, they turn a month later."
2.0,Runs hella small
2.0,Order at least two sizes above your normal size.
2.0,The material is so then you need to use under garment … seems like I’m wearing a Handkerchief that then ..
2.0,Arrived torn and I must mend before I can wear.
2.0,I can't them in my ear
2.0,The color of the rings is really good like real gold. Waaayyy too small tho. I'm an average size gal so my hands aren't overly gianormous. But these rings will barely fit the tips of my fingers. I did really like the design and look had they been just a tad larger I would<br />LOVE them.
2.0,"Picked 3X and it was more of an uncomfortably long hoodie than a hoodie dress, extremely unflattering. I used the sizing chart. If you’re a bigger girl with curves, I don’t recommend this product."
2.0,This watch broke within two days of my son wearing it
2.0,It's okay. It is pretty but earrings are small and the necklace would not stay put and kept flipping.
2.0,"These are advertised as a 7” inseam. They measure at 5” -too short. They are also see through, could read the tag through it. Nice, if you want to show off a bit ;)"
2.0,The fit was too large and made my hips look bigger
2.0,Super uncomfortable and looks too much like Batman when on. Will not be using it for event.
2.0,"If you are a individual that travels a lot for work, in my case a long-haul truck driver, this watch is not for you. I travel through several timezones a day in some cases and the watch never corrects itself. Even at night when I'm stationary. The watch looks great and the strap is comfortable, not a fan of the negative LCD display at the bottom, very hard to read. This would be a great watch for individuals that are stationary or don't travel. I'll never buy another Casio unless it's one of the higher end G Shocks or Master of G series, lesson learned."
2.0,"Made very cheap, you get what you pay for."
2.0,Didn't fit like I expected at all. Bought them a size bigger then usual and they were still too small. Have them to my little sister so now she rocks them around the house and I just stare in jealousy. If ur thick in the leg area don't bother!
2.0,"Stitching is much different than photo, also much boxier cut and shorter in length (and I’m short) than represented in photos. Very Disappointed. Was looking forward to it."
2.0,My daughter loves the costume but is sad because it didn’t come with the earrings that were advertised as part of the set.
2.0,"Hi,<br /><br />The black band around the wide brim floppy hat was not glued down well and more than half of the band is out of place and keeps slipping out of line with the rest. Not at all happy with this as I have to keep adjusting it to stay in place."
2.0,Fit is okay but I paid for cotton LINEN pants NOT cotton polyester pants making these over prices and unwearable.
2.0,Weird fit - loose in the butt and waist. Guess I need a Kardashian butt like the model’s.
2.0,"To me they look cheap in person,this is just my opinion. Mine also had a noticeable scrape on the frame so I had to send them back."
2.0,"Looks beautiful but too heavy for me, so I returned it."
2.0,"I loved everything about this watch... except for the digital display. It’s completely unusable. For example, check out the comparison photo I took between this watch and the 1A3 version (green strap). As you can see (or not) the positive display is nothing to brag about, but at least you can see SOMETHING in the digital display. This negative display is so bad, I had to return the watch. A shame."
2.0,"EDITED: Ive now used them a few times and my husband notices that I was getting a rash from these! Flower shaped mark off red bumps. Not cool.<br /><br />I think it's great to get so many for a low price... But you get what you pay for. There are tons (I purchased the 40 set)! And a convenient bag to put them in. These are suuuuper thin though. And it's a challenge to get the backing off. (I added some photos for reference). As for wearing them, comfortable but really hard to get smooth, and little bumps can still show through."
2.0,Very disappointed in this pair of sunglasses.  I guess you get what you pay for.  A lot of the camo print is scratched off like they are used.  These were supposed to be a Christmas present but Im too embarrassed to give them.
2.0,"These would be nice, although, they are way too small for my taste. If I had a bigger size, I would totally wear these."
2.0,Had to return way to small. Didn’t cover the chest area enough.
2.0,Did not fit well in the chest area
2.0,Very uncomfortable. Scratchy and not wearable. Donated to goodwill.
2.0,way too big for my face. that's what I get for not trying on first before purchase. guessing did not work out for me. quality seemed fair.
2.0,"I love this dress so much I bought it in 3 different colors. And while I can physically get it on, it is way smaller than the sizing chart indicates. There is NO way I could do up even one button. But I put a camisole underneath and it's cute as a button. I strongly suggest getting a size larger than the size chart indicates."
2.0,"The inner glove layer disconnects from the outer layer and after taking them on and off several times my hand no longer fits into the left glove. I've tried fixing them but it's pretty annoying. I guess you get what you pay for, I was going snowboarding for the first time and these did the trick for a day."
2.0,"Dress is so cute but is way too small, I ordered 1T-2T because my daughter is 20 months but it didn't fit at all...  I’m sure it would fit a 10 month old baby."
2.0,Ordered these in toddler 8.5 which is the size my daughter is in currently. They’re two sizes maybe three too big. And the size on them says 25? So I ordered the smaller size and although it is still a little too big the shape of the shoe is all wrong. My daughter trips a lot because they are so clunky and the strap doesn’t really do what it needs to do.
2.0,Had to return as it didnt look like the picture. It has a walmart type look to it.
2.0,It looks nice until you look at the watch face and watch hands got placed off center so the “circle” pieces are up on the edge of the piece causing the second hand to get stuck. Super disappointed.
2.0,The slipper looks great and has support and comfort UNFORTUNATELY they SHED EVERY WHERE!! Clumps of fur all over the house. I  expect the shoe to be naked in a month!!
2.0,"I was first really excited with this band as I loved the cute design. It was the perfect accessory for my upcoming Disney World trip, but it has not even held up for two months! I'm very disappointed in the quality as the laminate is already starting to lift up and crinkle. I was looking forward to sporting it around for awhile longer than this. Looks like it is back  to searching for a new band."
2.0,"Basically a glorified pair of chenille-type fluffy socks, with thin material soles that have &#34;slip-resistant dots.&#34;  DD wore them only at/inside the school, only on school days, starting end of August. They were in tatters before Thanksgiving.  Pretty, cute, but horribly cheap quality."
2.0,it was too small and it was not like it is pictured
2.0,Great gloves but the zipper on one hand broke with one use and the other hand on the third use.
2.0,"Not well made. I haven't given them to my son, whose shoe size is 11, and I doubt they will fit well or last. Very disappointed."
2.0,"These earrings are a little flimsy, they seem like they can break with little effort, I don't feel like they are as shiny as I thought they'd be either. They are easy to smudge believe it or not, I wish they were thicker and bigger in size, they don't really add anything to my look, I don't see me wearing these often to be honest. The only thing I like about them is the shape, that's about it for me."
2.0,picture is good but real item looks quality not good.
2.0,Material not comfy at all.  Not a big fan
2.0,"The chain looks good, but after wearing it for a while it turns my neck green, also the ends that clip onto glasses broke after four months use."
2.0,"Two 'circles' can be seen due to manufacturing.  And of course given the price, I didn't expect high quality lenses.  But I was hoping to not wash out all of the clarity.  Good if you need to swap lenses to abuse your glasses at work and can pop back in your good lenses.  If that is the case, look for an ANSI approved set to cover all of your bases."
2.0,This is a good looking and ultra-slim card holder.  Unfortunately the glue that holds it together gets on the interior pockets.  Even if I clean it off it keeps coming back.  This ruined my chip cards.
2.0,Thin material; you will see your bra through this even if it’s white or nude.  Not impressed.
2.0,It became black although I used it only for weeks. disappointing.
2.0,"Beautiful gown but measurements are incorrect!! Wear a 12 and I got a 12, waaaay too tight! Had to return it! Waaay too long also!!"
2.0,First the paint fumes were so strong. I could barely handle it I won't let my child put it on. She's into the Dyno masks I thought it was going to be more like that. She didn't like it
2.0,"I mean you get what you pay for. It is really cheap leather but it does the job. It looks great in my opinion, but the information is definitely lacking on the sellers side. It says 11&#34; strap but obviously it wasn't 11&#34;. If it was it would have fit just fine but as you can see from the pictures, I had to punch a hole in order to make this fit my wrist. Now I'm a large guy with big wrists so not a lot really works for me. But this leather strap didn't and was just another disappointment. If I were a normal sized guy with average wrists, this would be a well worth it buy! Don't play on my negatives just because I've got abnormally large wrists."
2.0,"I’ve read the review and decided to order these boxers.  I bought a size that should have been loose on me. When they arrived, I found them to be so small I couldn’t even get them on.  Do not compare these to fruit of the loom, AE, OR Haines when sizing. They are way off.  The underwear looked to be decent in quality but I was so discussed with the sizing I won’t order them again."
2.0,The only thing I disliked about these is the star is not a stone it's painted and looks cheap other then that the moon and ready is fine.
2.0,Great fashion shoes. The sole has completely came out after a week.
2.0,Received wrong item wanted Gucci style
2.0,Elastic is too lose.  Doesn’t not stay putZ
2.0,"I actually needed an insulated jacket for my outdoor workouts, and I think I still need to find one. This jacket is not all that comfortable and its not that warm either."
2.0,Honestly the picture is misleading. The dress does not define the waist like that whatsoever. And the shoulder make your top half look larger than it is.
2.0,"It was just a thin non flattering shirt. Was going to ware to Vegas for the 4th but once I tired it on it was very thin, rough type of fabric and cheap looking. I sent it back. It needs to have a spandex fabric in it because the fabric because that fabric is the type that becomes loose and stretches out over while wearing it."
2.0,Received product with black stains on it! Fits nice with good material. Just arrived dirty!
2.0,"My mother recently passed away, and my niece was getting married. She wanted my mother, her Nan to somehow be included in the ceremony. I purchased this for her to wrap around her flowers as she walked down the aisle. Unfortunately the opening is so so so tiny I was not able to get any of the ashes inside. It is made very nicely. Maybe mine was just defective?"
2.0,Several of them came apart or were too small
2.0,This little black dress is comfortable fits perfectly I love that it has sleeves. Wish it had pockets that would make it a lot better. It looks great with cowboy boots 👢. After washing the dress it shrunk  so recommend to dry clean/ wash by hand and air. Was super disappointed that it super short now.
2.0,I used them a few times and to my surprise the massage insoles  came off
2.0,"The pattern is attractive, but they are definitely for very curvy ladies. Wayyyy huge and roomy, even though Im not even close to skinny."
2.0,They shrank even in tap cold water and low heat dryer. They don't  stay up now. I bought 3 pair- I'll air dry the other two to see if they are useable
2.0,Too large for size 12/14.
2.0,My daughter says it fits as expected but the material is itchy and doesn't feel like silk.
2.0,this is not hermiones wand
2.0,"I ordered a long sleeve white shirt, I’m very tall (6F) and was hoping that this would be a holy grail item. Well it definitely is not. The arms were a nice length, but man are they tight, weirdly tight with v little stretch. Also it’s supposed to be a fitted shirt, the arms were the only thing fitted. I’m hulking out in the arms, but the body of the shirt is loose, it looks ridiculous. I think if I would have gone with a short sleeved option it would have been at least been wearable."
2.0,"Very cute, fell apart the first time I wore it"
2.0,This is a great set of earrings BUT the backs are not attached to the earring so it makes it incredibly difficult to put on. They were precious but were returned because of this. It took entirely too much time to put on.
2.0,"So much wanted to love this dress but it is DEFINITELY a stretch ,thin,see through material that shows all...including BULGES..yikes..not flattering..bigger size would make no difference.  You would need QUALITY undergarments because eveyrone will see what you are wearing."
2.0,Not durable - strap fell off
2.0,the material is much thinner than it seems in the picture.
2.0,16/18..3x extremely small
2.0,Human or machine error for size sent?
2.0,"These bike shorts are tight at the leg openings. Not for women with meaty or muscular quads.  The fabric is soft and the pattern is pretty and is not see through.  However, the fabric isn’t trimmed to the seams, one of my pet peeves!  I also dislike that the crotch is NOT gusseted. I am returning these shorts and in search of a pair that fits American women’s legs and is of a better quality but affordable brand."
2.0,"The quality of the this bag is definitely worth the price. It was flimsy and with no shape. Just cheap material over all. The bag looks bigger in the pic shown, reality is it’s NOT"
2.0,Broke immediately after 2 dayd
2.0,Weird printing
2.0,"This was NOT something to wear to a formal event, which is what I needed it for. It’s more like a club dress. I returned it."
2.0,"Buyers should be aware that Enchroma wants $150. To make ANY repair, even if all you need is a replacement frame.  I recently broke my pair.  The lenses are fine, and I can put them into new frames.  But Enchroma won’t just sell you frames.  They want their $150!  When the same thing happened to me a few years ago with Pilestone glasses, they shipped me a replacement frame for $20.  Now that is concern for the customer!"
2.0,Lost one in 1st few wearings they open too easy 😖
2.0,Not true to size and material quality is very poor
2.0,Love the colors in the fabric. Fit great everywhere except falls off my chest and you can see the pads . Gonna have it fit . Adding straps and new pads
2.0,"Material seems decent but the cut is awful. It’s almost like they left way too much slack under the armpits and it’s really unflattering. When I sprawl my arms out, I look like a flying squirrel. Just was too much fabric and they should have tightened it around the pits instead if having it bulge out. I have a Vshaped figure so for this to do the opposite is going to look even more exaggerated if you have a normal body type.  I don’t think this is possible to look good on anyone unless you get a medium, you’re super muscular and you normally wear a extra large."
2.0,The sandal are great but I ordered them for my father at 12 which is his size but they were way too big. I however wear a 14 and they just so happen to have for me perfect so I kept them but they were much to large for my father which was the purpose I ordered them in the first place.
2.0,Small sizing. Size up by 2 sizes at least. Quality and color is good. They’re just smaller than regular sizing.
2.0,"These would be fine for dress up and that’s it but my daughter wore them a lot and within two months the soles broke on the inside, and then I could see they are basically hollow squares under the thin padding.  Had to throw them out."
2.0,The only good thing I can say is the material was comfortable. This was a lot longer than I expected and huge. It looks like a mumu until you add the belt. Not the trim dress I was expecting at all.
2.0,So soft.  Too small.
2.0,It's OK. I returned it. The fit wasn't that flattering.
2.0,my sister loved this!! very pretty
2.0,"I absolutely ADORED this shirt, color and fit, until about the 2nd time I wore this (but not within the return period) when it ripped in the back. So bummed, thought it was a great shirt."
2.0,nicely made but way too big.<br /><br />update:<br />amazing customer service.<br />they kept trying to find me a band that would fit.<br />i didn't even call to complain. they probably contacted me about 8 times to jane it right.<br />i've decided to keep the one that's to big because i like it.<br /><br />update again: mine keeps unclasoing now that it’s winter and i am wearing long sleeves. it’s made my alta hit the hard concrete multiple times. beware!
2.0,Cute material but pretty cheaply made.  It would be a cute swimsuit for a teen but not for me.
2.0,"I have the brooks Ghost 10 and love them, these were recommended to me so I tried them out but they are causing my second toe to become raw. I've tried different socks but for some reason every time I run in these my toe is sore at the top and I have to go back to my Ghost."
2.0,"This scarf is of average quality, as to the feel of the faux fur and the weight of the piece itself. However, the scarf is not as shown in the photos. The color was quite different and didn't match any of the listing photos for other versions. The color of their items appears to be variable and this one was just not attractive and looked very fake. Good luck finding what will work for you."
2.0,"Fabric is cheap, but if your looking for this trend and only need to wear it a few times it works"
2.0,it's sooo cute but i got an xxl thinking i would be swimming in it.. not.. it's tight.. too bad
2.0,"Lining is totally crappy, made with material used for cheap shopping bags, will disintegrate quickly."
2.0,"Beautiful ear piece.  Looks just like the picture.  Delivered in a small bag and the post was bent to the point it almost broke.  It's very large for my ear and will not clip on my cartilage if the post is in my piercing.  It is not adjustable, unfortunately.  Luckily it's cheap, so I'm going to play around with it to see if I can get it to work because I really do like it."
2.0,Two stars because they fit really nicely and were quite comfortable...but the first day they broke. These are unfortunately very cheaply made and the top lace was split down the leather so I couldn't even tie them.
2.0,"nothing like it's pictured to be. granted, i'm very tall, but i also ordered two other knee-length pencil dresses and the other two approached my knee whereas this dress only went a few inches past my butt. cute color though"
2.0,I like the light material and length but they are huge!!!
2.0,"Description says &#34;spring assisted temple for comfort&#34;. There is no spring in the arms; only a pin hinge. False, misleading advertising."
2.0,Strong buckle but NOT 50mm as advertised.  Width is 2.3125 (2 5/16) = 58.7375mm!  Too wide for my purposes which is annoying now that it's in my lap
2.0,"The leggings themselves are fine, but the foot holes are so tight and narrow that my son literally could not get them over his feet."
2.0,The material is on the cheap end and the stitching is poorly done.
2.0,"Within a couple weeks of wearing these, the metal part broke off and the blue beaded part not only stretched out a lot, but the color also faded. Things like this are bound to go through some wear and tear and eventually break but it should not have happened this quickly, especially for the price being paid"
2.0,"I am 5'3 and 150lbs. These didn't fit very good at all. Hard to get on, as they are too short. Already got runs from pulling them up. Good colors though."
2.0,I wanted them for a gift for my daughter but they were way too big and gaudy.
2.0,Great light weight watch. But can only be used at night..you can not see the time during the day at all enless you hide it in the palm of YOUR hand...but i still love the sleekness and design..just wish it was 90 persent brighter
2.0,Got this dress to attend a wedding with.  Fits as expected except for the back bunches up with the zipper.  Really unflattering so now need to last minute dress shop for this wedding.  If you're looking to buy I wouldn't bet on this dress.
2.0,Demasiado chico....pero bonito.
2.0,First thing the ring is definitely NOT .925 sterling silver. It’s not stamped and my finger underneath where the band is has turned green. Also the ring is much bigger than expected. It’s beautiful costume jewelry but I purchased it because it said it was sterling silver.
2.0,"This may be a one-size fits all type of mask, but for me the fit is poor.  It is too small.  The ear-hooks barely hold on to my ears.  The mask pulls down on the bridge of my nose in a very uncomfortable manner.  And despite their claims that the design will prevent fogging up glasses, my glasses still get fogged up, likely due to the extremely poor fit."
2.0,"I waited a really long time to write this review because I want to LOVE this vest.. however, every time I wear it, I end up with sores where the plastic has rubbed me raw whilst running. I live in Arizona, so I don't wear thick shirts, but in order to be comfortable with this vest, I have to put a hand towel or roll an extra shirt between the vest and whatever shirt I am wearing...trust me, the last thing I want in the heat is more material.<br /><br />I am really bummed because I LOVE all the pockets, the extra water storage areas, and the whistle feature... I just wish it had more padding or the lumbar area was not made of a rough mesh material."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:5e11b1861b0ce44c0fecdcbd455df661]] I like the ring because I work in construction but I also vape and this is similar to a 1.99 buffer so at this price dont believe it is worth it
2.0,Very small and no chain with it!
2.0,Mine are two different sizes! I’m so upset they are so cute but I’m not going to ever get to wear them.
2.0,Not even close to the pic. The engraving is hard to see and the meta is thinner and pokes your side fingers. It looks cheap like it will soon turn my finger green.
2.0,Please don't buy this
2.0,The color was great. Product get lint’s balls very quickly
2.0,"Bought a size larger but still feel it does not stretch enough, I do not like shirts form fitting with leggings."
2.0,"I just got this in the mail, it is really cute but it comes with an awful smell from the insole. i know what a real lather smell and a synthetic material.  The smell is just discouraging. I am scared to let my child wear this because of that. This is going back."
2.0,"These are not very good compression shirts! They are very thin and not enough of the proper material to be compression. Also, they run very big! I usually were a large and read the reviews and got a medium and could've gotten a small!"
2.0,"The plating was slightly worn down and the crystals didn’t sparkle as much. Didn’t know I was purchasing a used item, but the person I gave it to liked it and that’s all I wanted. Ordered more from Swarovski using the ‘try before you buy’ hopefully these items are better quality because I am a fan and since my move I don’t have a store close by."
2.0,"I loved the necklace, but came with broken chain."
2.0,The bracelet is nice but it's easy to notice that it's not even close to the original one.<br />And the silver pain on the lock started to dissappear after a couple of days
2.0,"Super cheap feeling and seams are bulky, firs awkward"
2.0,"I ordered these to wear under sweatshirts as a second layer. Only received them on march 5, today is march 23, haven’t worn that much. Already has a hole in the seam. Very disappointed."
2.0,Did not fit very well with my 6 year old.  The sizing I feel is small.  This would possibly fit no more than a 4 year old.  I found it to be cheaper made and didn't hold up well.
2.0,i bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday party. The dress was super cute but too small & I had to return it.
2.0,The dress is beautiful and the net falls really nicely. However the lining is very cheap and the dress is basically fully see through. Really wanted to love this but sadly will have to return it.
2.0,It would have been nice if the adheisive tape was double sided so I could use it but it was not. I can still use it but I will have to buy my own double sided tape.
2.0,Now that I see them they are not as pretty as I expected. They are too big. I don’t know when I’ll wear them.
2.0,"At 37degrees, my fingers are very cold. Very disappointing."
2.0,"Let's face it .... you get what you pay for. Awful stitching and assembly. Supposed to be large. On a toddler they would be large. An adult a large small..... LOL<br />I'll be using these for reloading ammunition so I'm not looking for anything pretty, just functional and these are usable. Won't order again."
2.0,I hope this was a mismarked dress.  Too small bought a size up and fits like a size down. dress. I literally have 10 or 20 of these Indian print dresses all in large or extra larges. This one is an XL love the colors but it is so tight and so small it fits like a medium and I am a large. I’m 5’7” with a 36D and I can barely get this closed around me. I immediately returned it. Maybe other people have had better luck or maybe these are all just mismarked and ir mis-sized.
2.0,NOT HAPPY at all with the fit but keeping it because my son bought it for me. Material is almost jersey type material so No stretch at all.
2.0,It doesn't look good after leaving the dryer. This needs ironing to look good
2.0,"These were great while they lasted. Fun designs but these shrunk in the first wash. I didn't see any care or handling instructions on line or included in the package, Too bad, I would have gotten another pair."
2.0,"The quality and quantity are great. However, when you attach it to your jewelry it doesn’t hang right. The wings aren’t balanced so it falls back too far. It gives the jewelry piece an off look."
2.0,The dress was fine but the sleeves were very tight. I returned it.
2.0,Much much much too small to put photos in. we had to send it back. should have noticed the measurements more but miscalculated; found it hard to believe they would even sell a locket for photos that are too small for photos
2.0,Not what I expected somewhat thin wish you was a better quality like the style
2.0,They don't seem to strong very deceiving
2.0,Runs small!! If you are medium  you May want to buy this large.
2.0,"Looks very nice and stylish on the picture, when I wore it I looked Amish.  Just not the look I was going for."
2.0,Much larger than size indicates
2.0,Too tight!
2.0,Mask soft and like the adjustable ear loop. Was disappointed that stitching came apart with first use.
2.0,Bought it for my 9 year old daughter. Didn't realize it was a crop-top hoodie for an adult...🤣 It's cute though.
2.0,retuened. miles to big...runs large.
2.0,Beautiful but not true to size... Way too big!
2.0,These pants don’t have much give making them restrictive for ice skating. Returned.
2.0,Shrunk after first time washing the shirt. The necklace that came with it was awful.
2.0,Just not big enough for me.
2.0,Not easy to get on and off
2.0,"They were cute, but poorly made. One broke the first time I wore it, I won't be looking for button earrings again."
2.0,They advertised wrong size and it's annoying.
2.0,"There was lots of gaping going on here. If I bend there for sure would be a nip slip. Chest: 32.5"" fuller at the bottom, flat at the top. The white line was also visible no matter what because it was sewn too close to the top, and the sewing was wavy and not straight."
2.0,"Did not come with instructions so I followed the video, which doesn't cover it all. The cheap plastic components are unattractive and the self-watering feature does not work, nor does the water level indicator. And now there's little hope for My Little Hope plant. It dies a bit more each day since I transplanted it into this pot 😫. I am a novice plant parent and this planter just made my list of epic fails. Good soil and the best food can't help it now."
2.0,Pero muy corta para una persona llenita
2.0,I took it out of the box and thought it was so pretty I put it on right away since I was getting to go somewhere at that time.  I was so proud wearing it but by the time I got home I went to take it off along wth my other jewelry and I almost cried when I saw it was no longer on my wrists.  No more purchasing these from there. What a waste of money and a huge disO
2.0,It's a nice enough purse.  I just don't think that the quality justifies the price.
2.0,"36DD here. I received a size “E”...... huh? Anyway, no support whatsoever. But I can see how it would work wonders for smaller breasted women. Hard to get on and off. When I had it on, the strings were NOT easy to tighten like the ads says. Big breasts get lost and all flabby and all over the place in this bra. Glad I investigated all the hype. Does not work for big breasted women like me. #returning"
2.0,"First, I ordered a large based on other reviews of running large.. and it was still too small! Secondly, based off of the provided images by the company, I assumed the fit would be more of a basic tank fit.. These are cut like athletic tanks so just know that ahead of time."
2.0,Pom poms came off of one pair as soon as I took them out of the package. Another pair lost the Pom poms and had a hole in them...
2.0,"This rubber is as hard as a rock. I have many silicone, polyurethane, and PVC rubber dive bands and have never even seen anything as hard as this. If its silicone it does a good impression of a solid plastic. But it looks good and is extreamly heavyduty. Its overpriced in my opinion!! I went from 1 to 2 stars because its atleast wearable"
2.0,nice looking holder but  motor died
2.0,I dislike that purse was not pure white
2.0,"I know this review is not about the fit or quality of the band, but I couldn't get that far because of the awful smell. When I opened the Amazon shipping envelope, I could smell the ""fragrance"" and thought maybe it had been next to some package containing cheap air freshener. But then I opened the sealed package containing the band and the smell really hit me. I had to immediately take it outside. I don't have a chemical sensitivity, but I don't like most fragrance either (use unscented products). It really made me think of the fragrance cakes used in public bathrooms. I don't know if it was wiped down with scented sanitizer before shipping or something spilled on it before packaging. But, there was no way I could wear this band, it still smelled after being outside. So I returned it that day! I give it 2 stars because it is cheap and maybe this was just a fluke. I wasn't going to try another one though."
2.0,"I bought 2 different packs of these, I like the shirts and the way they fit but the colors are off.  The pack of red, purple and teal are about 5 shades lighter than the picture.  The purple looks like a lavender, the red looks like a pink, and the teal looks more aqua.  Would buy the darker (black, grey, navy) colors again but not any of the others."
2.0,"I ordered a size up but still didn't fit right.  The quality is not what I expected, had to return it."
2.0,"It was cute but really petite.  I finally got the nerve to wear them but one of the clasps came undone and, as a result,  these will be in the trash.  Again, really cute but not durable."
2.0,"This is well designed, except for the cheap snaps. One ripped off the first time I removed the neck flap. I wrote to the seller to see if I could buy replacement snaps, but received no answer. I guess at this price you just buy another hat, but for me, it won' t be this one."
2.0,My son used his own money to buy these and they split towards the front by the pinky toe- became completely useless.<br />They are a name brand but disappointed in the product.
2.0,Sweater was not as long in the picture and the sleeves were not like in the picture. I was disappointed with this product and will not reorder.
2.0,"Bands are adorable and comfortable, but don’t secure to watch so it constantly comes unhooked, very frustrating and not worth the effort."
2.0,"I sent these back because there was a logo on the front of the shirt. I wish that was disclosed before I bought, the shirts were nice but I hate logos."
2.0,"The size was right and fits my foot well, but overall these boots are horrid. They are ugly and look awkward..."
2.0,"I love the look of this.  I thought the cup was a really nice size and the detailing was cool.  But it broke after only wearing it twice!  I didn't do anything crazy, the chain just snapped where it connects to the cup.  Nice-looking but very cheaply made.  I'm very disappointed."
2.0,"Nice ring set, but turned."
2.0,"While this band is built well and feels great the money you save with it will only be used to buy another, and another.  After 1 year the springs in the mounting mechanism completely rusted out.  The band is now useless without new springs.  I can only assume the genuine Garmin equivalent uses stainless steel springs that will not corrode."
2.0,"Weird cut, baggy crotch, does not look flattering, too dark green, returned them."
2.0,"This item looks very cheaply made and looks like something you would buy out of a bubblegum machine. Daughter is very disappointed with what it looks like, was going to be given as a gift to a friend for there birthday."
2.0,Too small. It’s ok I gave it to a friend. Just keep in mind it’s that thin t shirt material not 100% cotton so after one wash you’ll look like an emo kid from 2006
2.0,"Used the measurement to calculate a medium which was considered a 38, but when I tried it on, it was too small.  Nice quality, bad fit."
2.0,"way too small, I had to return it"
2.0,"Sized smaller than marked, lightweight material.  Yeah, it;s a jersey but the weight is that of a lightweight t shirt.  Good price though, and it was the color I was looking for.<br /><br />After about 12 months and a couple dozen washings I am starting to see some small holes develop in the fabric.  Just not durable enough to recommend."
2.0,"One star for on time arrival. One star for the fact that product was specified length and color. The chain smelled like diesel fuel, and was very greasy. I rinsed them in a mild soap. Not a good idea! Now the chain is rusty! I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I got the dark navy + pink flowers and it's a thin, jersey feeling material."
2.0,"Beautiful fabric, beautiful skirt, but even with the sizing chart, incredibly small and uncomfortable. It will look beautiful hanging in my closet."
2.0,The earrings are beautiful. However the packaging is awful and damaged the earrings. the package is too small and damaged the bottom of the earrings.
2.0,A bit snug and short in the torso (even for a petite 5'4&#34;). The collar is difficult the manage because the fabric is thin and cheap so it doesn't have the heft it needs to hold its shape well. Disappointed.
2.0,Does not fit like any other ring. Very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Way too small. Slightly larger than my toddler. Smaller than my size 4 lace top similar to this one. It does smell awful. I'm sure the smell would disappear after a few washes. For sensitive skin it does not seem to bother me. But, again, way too small. Not at all like the picture."
2.0,"slides , and is too big for my wrist"
2.0,"Stiff, Harsh , coarse scratchy feee;  uncomfortable.  Not for extended wear, sleeping or resting in.  For a ten minute procedure, ok for modesty/"
2.0,I'm 5'8&#34;. They are really short. Not one size fits all.
2.0,The Images make band appear to be robust and thick. Not the case. Same flimsy thin band as original. Disappointed. Not worth returning either.
2.0,Very dowdy looking.  Straight style - not for anyone with hips.
2.0,The fabric glitter was coming off . It had to be glued on and I hope it stays on.
2.0,Lasted for about 4 days then popped off of my neck
2.0,Great fit but got a run in fabric after wearing twice.
2.0,I tried this item on today for the pool! It was nice but a lot bigger than posted in the photo. The sizing is a bit awkward.
2.0,"Nice design, seems well made but...the link removal tool bent!  I needed to remove 3 links and could only remove one of the links, the rest were so tightly linked that the tool did not work.  Returning....."
2.0,"The jacket is warm and comfortable.  I bought it for traveling, so the stuff bag is important to me."
2.0,Very soft and warm material but the beanie cap is too small to put on. No scarf was enclosed either! I am sorry I have to return these!
2.0,sadly unflattering on my round shorter shape. I will return this. The color was overwhelming on me. I think I would have liked it if I was taller and thinner :)
2.0,"Out of the 3 pieces, the plastic choker was missing..."
2.0,I have a few swiss dot dresses and all are sized appropriately.  This dress ran really small.  I returned it.
2.0,Tooooo small can't be 1/2in
2.0,"The watch arrived with a chip in the upper face of the watch, right above the 12. I would like this watch alot more if they put a glass face on it at the very least instead of the cheap plastic."
2.0,"I order a Small, but this is very big for a small"
2.0,The pants fit amazingly. But the jacket and vest not so well. If you're chunky with a belly don't go by the waist size of the pants when ordering. Order the suit bigger and just wear a belt to hold the pants up.
2.0,The shoes are too small.  They look cute.  I am just upset that they didn't fit.
2.0,Super cute but had to return. Runs really small. They did not have the size I needed in stock so I had to have them refund. Otherwise I would have ordered larger size.
2.0,Was not happy with the fit or the fabric so I will be returning the dress for credit back to my cared
2.0,"This dress was okay quality,  but completely see thru. So I could not wear it. I returned over a week ago and haven't had any refund posted to my account."
2.0,I did not like the fit were very loose on my feet and they were the right size
2.0,Product was a faded red color.
2.0,"I dislike about the glasses holder is that it’s too thick for a child who has a lot of hair, so it kind of rubs against the hair in the back of the head"
2.0,I have no idea why this bag smells so horrible :( It's stuffed with fabric softener sheets right now) It's really REALLY cheaply made.  I think the interior will last me maybe a month. But..it was cheap...and you get what you pay for... Atleast it's cute.
2.0,"We ordered black and the color looks more like a navy blue. Ordered the largest size they had (12) and it was too short on my 11 y/o. It fell right below her knees, not a cute look."
2.0,I have owned over a hundred polo shirts & never had one that was too long. I was as if this was for Big & Large men.
2.0,This item runs small. The sleeves especially. The material is also thin.
2.0,"I honestly can't tell you how this dress fits because it was so poorly made that the lining was sewn in a knot/tangled and I couldn't even step into the dress.  It is as pictured as far as the pattern goes (it is rose gold as others have mentioned) but is not made well and looks cheap.  Within the 2 minutes it took me to take the dress out of the package and realize that the thing was sewn incorrectly, about a dozen sequins fell off.  I didn't expect this dress to be amazing seeing as the price is so low... but I did expect to be able to at least try it on and have it sewn correctly.  Big fail and big disappointment for me."
2.0,It's too big to work with my helmet - it pushes it way up in front.
2.0,"The hearts are massive in size, not what was expected"
2.0,"These pants were purchased for my daughter. She wears a size L so naturally I purchased her size, but to make sure I bought an XL as well. Unfortunately,  neither size fit. Both were  waaaaaay to small and tight. I had to return all items."
2.0,I absolutely loved this wallet but after 6 months both zippers split and wallet is no longer functional. And trust me I did not overload it. Kind of disappointed bc I loved this wallet. It was so practical and did the job if I didn’t want to carry my entire handbag or diaper bag.
2.0,I got the maroon suit. It fit well and has great material but I did not like that you could see the white fabric from the other side.
2.0,"It looks great, just really easy to be breakable."
2.0,"It fit but the pics are inaccurate. Had a weird western-looking red thread design on the shoulders and mid sleeve buttons, presumably for rolling up and securing the sleeves. Very odd. Would not by again despite the perfect fit."
2.0,dont get cold enough i have had much better
2.0,The writing is hard to see. Smaller than the picture.  Looks cheap.
2.0,"Probably the strangest gym shorts I’ve ever ordered... they’re a little heavier than normal gym shorts and they fit tighter than any I’ve ordered.<br /><br />But the most bizarre part about these shorts..... the back pocket is right in the middle of your ass crack. I’ve seen shorts with pockets on either side or no pockets at all. But I have never seen a zipper pocket that land in the middle of your ass. Honestly I don’t even know how to feel at this point. Just my luck, I’ll have my car keys in my back pocket and accidentally sit on them, they’ll disappear forever."
2.0,Fitted. Very heavy weighing on my shoulders. I dont Like how much it hurts pulling me down. Good for workouts i guess But it rides up.
2.0,My watch falls off fairly frequently.  The bands don't stay in place and lock.
2.0,"Well, I thought it was cute and it is. But if you have animals their hair will stick to this band like crazy and I HATE it. I’m constantly pulling fuzzies off it like crazy."
2.0,"The earrings have good weight. My issue is that the detail on the scarabs is inconsistent. One earring has refined detail while the other one has no detail at all. In addition, one of the wires arrived bent and I had to reshape it. For the money I paid, I'm very disappointed!!!"
2.0,"I loved this when I initially got it. It comes with different length bars to suit your piercing and the stud is very pretty. However, this is not an earring that you can wear over an extended amount of time. The stud moves and unscrews as you wear it. I had mine for 5 days before it fell off."
2.0,I typically don't order shorts or pants online. So when I ordered these I went up 2 whole sizes. Told myself it would be safe I would use a belt. I just wanted them to fit. When I got them I couldn't even pull them up all the way. Which sucks because I ordered 2 pair. I assumed going up 2 sizes would be safe. Only reassured myself not to order pants or shorts online.
2.0,"It doesn’t matter how much fabric softener I use, this shirt clings to my body."
2.0,"They fit fine, are comfortable, and warm, but have had them less than 2 months and they are already falling apart. Very disappointed"
2.0,Top was too small and bottoms too big
2.0,I received another style jean. Not the one pictured.  Totally disappointed
2.0,The dress is really small. I wear a size 6 and this dress is more like a size1. The material and print was nice but had to return it.
2.0,"The buttons on this coat are crooked. I don't understand how it passed quality control. Too bad because the coat fits well, and is nice looking, but I can't wear it with the buttons being so off.  See the attached picture."
2.0,Too small not a  real 2xl.
2.0,Cheap. Looks dumpy.
2.0,Love them but they started to change color quickly. Now my rose gold looks brass and silvery
2.0,Size was supposed to be an XXL and that was the way it was marked.  The actual size of the shirt was more like a large.  Lucky we have a smaller boy in the family that could wear it.
2.0,"Although the dress looks beautiful in pictures it is not flattering for a bigger, curvier body. The material is sorta stretchy but not flattering. It comes folded in a plastic bag which causes it to be super wrinkled which I guess is to be expected. The sleeves on the dress are also so tight! I ordered a 2X which normally works great for my figure but this was smaller than the general 2X sizing. Will be returning."
2.0,"At best its barely legible at what its supposed to be. The image was more red than skin tone, blurry, and just bad quality. It was like mine was rushed just to get it out."
2.0,"didnt notice hardly any difference, except for lights looked yellow instead of white."
2.0,It came to me broken. When I opened to package and took the necklace the purple piece fell off. The glue didn't hold it together.
2.0,Not the most attention to detail.  The button positioning at the top of the shirt was sloppy and I decided to simply cut them off.
2.0,Not really the rain jacket material I was expecting. Very thin.
2.0,Nice hat but the shield is worthless. It’s made of soft plastic that in no way looks like the photo in advert. Wont keep shape.
2.0,This piece would be so awesome if it fit however it would have only fit 5 year old finger I tried to adjust and finally made it to fit I was just sad because it does look amazing if you have a really small but long fingers I would highly recommend it
2.0,White dress is see through.. the top of the dress is cut weird.. doesn't fit right. Will be returning.
2.0,"Good price, but even the XL top is too small for a c-cup.  The bottom is cute, but hits at a weird spot- widest part of the waist area.  I ended up keeping it, but had to wear a different top."
2.0,Well the screw backs are what got me but they strip rather quickly.  The posts are also really long and poke the back of your ear/neck area when you lay down. They looked really good though just not made good. I should've looked elsewhere.
2.0,"I bought these for my son when he was a baby, just learning to roll over.  They were super cute on him.  However, they started to unravel after only a few washes, and eventually they all got very stringy and I had to throw them away."
2.0,Poorly made and it fits like a workout shirt.
2.0,Not the best dress. Difficult for me to assemble with the ropes in the back. I ended up returning it because I just couldn’t manage it.
2.0,Not a top grade shoe.
2.0,It’s cute but the color is off
2.0,Cute keyring but broke after a couple months use.
2.0,"Looks great, but it's sized way too small.  I went a size higher than I normally wear, and it's still too small to button.  I can wear it open, but even that is tight on the back and shoulders."
2.0,Very Sheer and shows too much. Wear a slip...
2.0,"Obviously not real Oakley. They don’t fit, they don’t snap in."
2.0,"The printing on the shirt itself was ok, but runs very small and the material is thin."
2.0,Its would probably look good on someone of asian or caucausion descent.
2.0,I followed the measurements on the fitting guide. And when I got it and tried it on it was way too big. Super sad!!!
2.0,Bottoms fit like expected but the top was too small. Had to return. Bummed because the bottoms were really cute.
2.0,"As much as I wanted to give this garbage shirt 1 star, it was for the most part as-described, undamaged, and showed up in time to be made into a last minute Star Trek TOS Uniform for Halloween.<br /><br />Now on to the dirt:<br />1) This is extremely low quality. The material is thin, cheap, and not even soft. There are loose/stray threads EVERYWHERE.<br />2) There's a thick collar trim you cant really see in the pictures.<br />3) This shirt literally STINKS. Like a horrid combination of BO and chemicals. Washing the shirt didn't even help.<br /><br />Anything you can get at a Walmart, Target, or Kohl's discount rack would be better quality than this thing by a mile. Unfortunately, it was the only red v-neck long sleeve I could find and get delivered with 2 days notice. If it wasn't for a costume, I'd be more upset. If you're looking for an actual wearable shirts, run away!"
2.0,I love The styling but once it was washed it shrink to almost half its size
2.0,Shorter then expected but my daughter likes them.
2.0,This suit runs very small! I am 5'7 and 155 lbs and ordered a L and it didn't come close to fitting.
2.0,Fit was ok... pants was a little loose. I ordered an xl. I wear size 14. I didn't like it. I ordered the purple and black one. It looked like pajamas. My husband disliked it as much as I did.
2.0,Underwire popped out on one side on second wash.  🥲
2.0,It just wasn't my cup of tea
2.0,"I usually wear a medium and ordered a large and the sleeves are no where near long enough. The material is rough, not soft at all. The inside sheds bad even after washing. I love the color and style, but the quality is very poor. The material has a lot of snags even upon opening."
2.0,"I gave two stars because the mask itself is pretty ding darn cool, but probably before the item was put in the actual amazon box, it got bumped or something. The box is unscathed so maybe it was dropped? Not too sure, but the mask broke and the mesh came undone from it. Poor Rambo in the sweatshop had to get it done fast enough to get it here in two days before the Prime Overseer lashed down upon them for not finishing sooner. I won’t return it solely because I am sure hot glue would just blend in with the rest of the poopy glue job. Hope you are doing okay little Rambo. The rest of the mask looks good ❤️"
2.0,The skirt is beautiful but difficult to figure out how to tie it.
2.0,Band in pants rolled on first wash.and impossible to repair!
2.0,"I think these sunglasses fit me well and are comfortable, but for some reason they make it hard for me to see, even though they aren’t exceptionally dark. I’m not sure I can quite put my finger on why, but it’s hard for me to clearly tell what is going on around me at all times with these sunglasses in vs my Oakleys. For that reason I’m not a huge fan of them."
2.0,ordered XL fit like a medium gave it to my wife
2.0,"Runs slow ,and has a very cheap band chrome plated 😂"
2.0,Critical flaw at the weld to the end pieces. Mine broke almost right away. I was all set to send it back. But I liked the rest of the bracelet & clasp. So I canceled the return & drilled the last 2 end links to go over the retainer pins. I think it was .075 but fairly easy as it had pin holes already.<br /><br />Works fine now-but really un-acceptable for those who don't want to modify or drill the product. For the price & to save hassle -worked for me.
2.0,"This bra is AMAZING at creating cleavage, however the band is just way way too big.  It makes the entire bra uncomfortable."
2.0,SHEIN and ZAFUL selection of colors and styles are cute just never really cover right I should have looked at the reviews super cute just wish it covered more
2.0,"The glasses were solid and had a good frame but were not nearly as lavender tinted as the photo. They basically looked clear, very disappointing."
2.0,The stitching was off
2.0,Did  not  fit  good  at all was a little  too  big
2.0,"This dress is made out of costume material. It’s unfortunately tool. Makes it not comfortable to wear. I was hoping for something that I could wear any day, not just Halloween."
2.0,Is very thin silky material. Not what I expected from a poncho. This is definitely for looks only
2.0,"&#34;Leather&#34; on mine was melted in areas of the front and back. Although the wallet was not what I had in mind,  I am modifying my original rating because the company contacted me multiple times absent out of their way with suggestions and alternatives to rectify the situation and I appreciate that."
2.0,Irritating to attach to the watch and turned my skin green
2.0,My three year old thinks these are too tight and I would have to agree. It says they are adjustable but I don't see how they adjust. Definitely not as comfortable as his Baby Banz. I was trying to go up to a larger size but I guess we will be ordering a second pair of Baby Banz for baby #2.
2.0,"Very cute, but did not stay on my daughters feet."
2.0,"These are definitely cute but run a little larger than the sizing chart indicates by the manufacturer. I only had them on for a minute which allowed no time to stretch them out, so it's definitely the company rather than being overly-worn. I was really hoping they'd honor a replacement and I could just return the product once the new pair arrived as many companies do allow that and I was needing these for an event next Friday. It's good customer service in my book. Instead, I'd have to reorder a new pair meaning I'd need to pay again before a refund is processed, so I'm ordering from a different company instead. They DO allow you to print a return label which is helpful."
2.0,I only ordered because my daughter specifically wanted the pink stone. But it’s definitely more white.
2.0,Colors were nice but you can see through them when you bend over. Compared to the neelus brand I bought on amazon these large run small.
2.0,"The hands were loose, and the skirt is see-through. I tried to wear with grey tulle-skirts underneath, that way it became a bit puffy which was nice. But I decided to return it as the fabric is not comfortable to wear. It is itchy and does not fit where it is supposed to fit."
2.0,"Nice boots, but I need to exchanged for other size and price is double. Crazy ...just one week after the first purchase ....😕"
2.0,"Well made, good material, workmanship and a great value for the money, but unfortunately padding is too far to the front. I keep adjusting it  back, but after a while the rear edge of the padding is just under my seatbones, and the front it feels like wearing a jock guard. Not sure if it's a design issue or just a defective item. I own a few more Przewalski/Spotty bibs and none of them have this problem."
2.0,Bad material one trip and the front ripped stitching was already loose in some spots
2.0,"Looks nothing like the picture.  Definitely looks made in China by some tired children.  Threads unevenly cut, cheap fabric, short sleeves."
2.0,Feels cheap . Material.doesnt breath at all.
2.0,Not the greatest quality but it’s lasted a few months now.
2.0,I was very disappointed to open the shirt and see how short is was. I have to send it back because of how short is it. Otherwise ba cute shirt and nice material but be warned the shortness of this shirt would be best for my 6yr old.
2.0,"Ordered for my son, sizing is incorrect-although the belt itself it very nice."
2.0,"I like the print, the material is nice, and the construction seems solid all things you want in a sports bra.  Unfortunately it doesn’t offer as much coverage as I was expecting and the straps are kind of all over the place and takes a lot of finesse to line up.  The only really problem I have with this is the coverage. It’s definitely not made for large breasts. I wear a 36DDD and ordered an XL. The fit around my ribs is fine, not too much back fat bulging out but I’m spilling out in the front.  It’s as if they didn’t account for breast size increasing when making the pattern larger.  I won’t be ordering from the company again. Although they hit it out of the park on so many aspects; what’s the point of a sports bra if you’re going to have a nip slip in the gym?"
2.0,"The overall size and weight of the material is nice, but with the velcro being so weak I'm not sure if they'll stay on my kid on the playground. Might be good for someone just out shoveling or doing low key activities."
2.0,Runs big- worn one day and already unraveling
2.0,Its one of those shirts!! Amazon photos are deceiving! Sleeve hang on by litlle threads. (I own these shirts in past and didnt even last 6 months in washer sleeves fell off!)  Iam shock they charged me $15 for this. I do not reccommended. Not durable at all!
2.0,Runs small too tight
2.0,"Bought these for my husband, they barely fit his hands.  They are just ok more appropriate for a womans hands."
2.0,Very thin and does not drape the way it looks in the picture
2.0,Cute but run really small. Had to return.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this product. The rave reviews and the amount of people who reviewed them made me think it would be a great dress, but even after just trying it on once the stitching from the buttons were already coming loose and getting caught. It's a pretty looking dress, but like a lot of things from overseas is cheaply made.<br /><br />Just for reference, I bought a size small. I'm 5'4, 129 pounds and wear a 34C. It fit fine, but was a little bit loose and a tad bit longer than I thought it would be. I think if I kept it and washed it, it'd be fine, but unfortunately, I'll be returning it."
2.0,Soooo small. It’s for a teddy bear not a grown woman. Even the large fit like a small
2.0,These are cute but so much smaller than expected!  I feel like the photos used are very misleading.
2.0,"I really liked my old one, but they changed it.  No longer a place for a check book.  Sent it back."
2.0,"Nice ""hoodie"".  But I ordered a cadet neck sweatshirt!  But I kept it despite that error because the hoodie is a great fit and looks and feels great when I am wearing it.  too bad.....won't trust them to get it right the next time so will look for another vendor."
2.0,"Hardly any wax at all. More like untaxed laces. If they’re all like these, I wouldn’t buy again. Bought in black & brown. May return."
2.0,"Look and feel great when you first wear them, however....  after the first wash they fade, pucker, and the fabric sheds.  Very poor fabric on these shorts.  Very disappointed.  (Yes, I know how to wash clothes in delicate, cold water, without harsh detergents!  It is the fabric.)  I will try to take it to the drycleaners and see what they can do with it. ."
2.0,"Skirt is pretty and fits well. It’s just that the fabric is very thin, the buttons are not attacked well, and you have to air dry and iron the skirt after washing it."
2.0,"They are not tight around the calves/ankle, and have weird creases in odd places that don't go away which makes these look cheap. I love the sage color, but the fit is weird around the lower leg. Wish the sage color came in full length."
2.0,"Poor quality. Had chips and scratches littered all over the rings. None-platted fake gold would have been a wiser choice, if any."
2.0,"This would have been very lovely, had it fit. The fabric is a little stiff and polyester like but it is very cute for the price. Just Way way way too small."
2.0,This mask was not big enough for an adult face my kids can wear it easily. It is also hard to breathe through.
2.0,"My daughter bought this for me. She didnt realize the logos are not embroidered, just ironed on. She could've bought an embroidered hat for the same price."
2.0,I wouldn’t recommend them. They look cheaply made. The buckle was weird. Returned them.
2.0,Beautiful piece but turned my neck green 😒
2.0,I ordered the XL. Love the material quality and the tank top cover. I typically wear a large shirt but I read that these run small so I ordered a size up. Not only is it super tight around my belly but my nipples hang out ON BOTH SIDES lol. I can't wear this is public.
2.0,I love the full-length Ouges V-neck dresses and wanted something for the summer but these do not fit the same :(
2.0,Unfortunately the dangling beads that are supposed to show the artwork are very small. The print of the artwork is also very dark. You don’t get to see the swirls or the bright yellows and blues that make the painting recognizable.
2.0,Item sized too small
2.0,I got these readers because I need them for work looking at the screen all day. I believed them to be blue light blocking. They are more like filtering. I have a blue light beam that came with glasses from another brand to prove that the or glasses are blue light blocking. I used them on other brands and the blue light blocked. With these the blue light was faint but not gone. I will use them for just reading.
2.0,"Love how warm these are but I’ve only worn them twice and there is two small holes already along the seam. Also, they do run big so order the next size up."
2.0,"Cheaply made, and the color wasn't correct."
2.0,I loved these yoga pants until the day I went to yoga and one of the yogis after class informed me they are completely see-through when I bend over and they could see everything. Even if you go up in size they are still see through.okay for running but never bend over or strech in them. I had 4 pairs of these too! Then I tested them all and yep you can see right through them.
2.0,"Well, one of the slide beads was missing and the color was disappointing.  Not the nice clear bright colors in the photo but rather dull and muddy looking."
2.0,Very tight fitting which results in cold fingers.
2.0,"Lace these gently and don't pull on them too hard or the eyelets might come off.  I got these shoes and really loved them....at first. When I went to actually wear them out and lace them up, (much like one of the reviews before mine)....the eyelet broke off and I sent them back. I got another pair after the return and leave them as they came, like a slip on and that works. They're cute, but not made very well. Special occasion shoes for sure."
2.0,Super soft slippers but so very soft that your foot slips out of it.  Wish these had a little more structure.
2.0,"true size 10 women average width cuts badly into heel, couple hours maximum."
2.0,Pretty flimsy.  Better off paying more and getting a more substantial hat
2.0,Way too long. I ordered a Medium and I am 5&#34;7. It wouldn't even work with heels on. Had to return.
2.0,"These were stiff. I thought they would be supple and cool but they had a smell. Not like good leather smell, but like chemicals. The magnetic snaps were a cool idea but they did not outweigh the weird leather smell and the stiff feel. Too bad."
2.0,"These shorts are hand wash only, which is a tad bit inconvenient. The zipper on the back pocket also broke after about a week."
2.0,The flowers are WHITE :(
2.0,"one hinge fell off within 3 months!<br />To the manufacture: Do not eve use ""glue"" to stick things together, your pin head!"
2.0,Really poor fit. Fit way too big.  Not like described.  Color bought was black. Color shipped was purple.  Refund requested
2.0,It broke the second day my son wore it. I'm really disappointed and I have already thrown away the return slip.
2.0,For the price it's not a bad watch. Has a sleek look and kept time great....until I took it on a flight. Now it doesn't work. Lasted about two months.
2.0,CHEAPLY MADE.<br />BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THEM AS GIFTS. (GREAT PRICE AND GREAT PICTURE)<br />WE GET WHAT WE PAY FOR... SILVER? LEATHER? DON'T THINK SO!<br />PAY LITTLE BIT MORE AND GET MORE QUALITY! BUY AMERICAN!!!!!!!!!
2.0,These run small!! I even bought a bigger size just to be safe and it's still snug
2.0,"Soooooo, top is super cute! Bottoms are hideous. Much too high and ridiculously tight!"
2.0,the beads constantly pinch arm hair if you have them. It makes the cool look not worth it all unless you remove your arm hair
2.0,"I bought these because they were on sale for less than $7. And I liked the design, but realized when they arrived that the back pockets are fake. And one of the front pockets was sewn shut! Crazy!"
2.0,The loops are not tight enough so the glasses keep coming out of them
2.0,This dress does not fit to size. I am 5’9 and it was way too short and does not fit like my usual size.
2.0,"This bag is too small, I can't even put my average size wallet in it. And no pockets or liner on the inside."
2.0,"It’s a very cute dress but I can’t use it because it’s see through, I really wish it wasn’t."
2.0,"the dragon beautiful, but is cast badly, jags stick out and it is possible to be wounded till it bleeds"
2.0,Is not a batwing sweater
2.0,We got married September 15th 2018 and the black part on the ring has worn off big time....Didn't expect that...I guess it is true...You get what you pay for!
2.0,bought for my son. The color was perfect but the tie itself started to fray and he hadn't even worn it. Now it looks old instead of brand new.  He told me the other night don't buy anymore ties from this company.
2.0,"These slippers look fantastic, but are poorly made. I bought them for my toddler, who will not where them because the glue holding them together is hard and pokes her toes if she does not have socks on."
2.0,Not as brightly colored as pictured and there are brown leaves on my roses that were not shown in the picture.
2.0,"This stated sizes 5-6 which would have been perfect but when I received it the sticker said Ages 5-6...  that's a Big difference!!  I should have returned them. And the product, material and sticking I thought were very low quality."
2.0,Not “vintage “ photo they used was a different shade or orange and the flag is printed off sides. Material is scratchy
2.0,"Good for 1 weekend trip, but break real easy and last me only 2 weeks before they broke."
2.0,"The SAXX boxer briefs are super-overpriced and gimmicky. The performance is no better than the crappy Hanes that Walmart sells. The pouch is too small and placed too low. The support is nothing more than compaction. The inner wings of fabric do nothing except make getting your package situated a futzy exercise. There is no need for separate compartments for your boys. Any old polyester/spandex shorts will smash your package.<br /><br />I have performance men's underwear that have properly designed support for the genitals. They cost about $5/pair. I need more, but I can no longer find them for sale. The other briefs that I have tried claim to have ""contoured pouches"", but they really don't. The SAXX underwear is no better, just 8 times the price."
2.0,"Fits fine but only two stars because the crotch area ripped (more like shredded) with the first wear.  Considering it was only a few bucks and my wife's butt looks superb in these, I gave it a second star."
2.0,Product appeared to be fine but after one wearing the arm fell off one of the glasses.  I have a small head so the glasses were not tight enough to break the arm off.  I would not purchase again.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these - I mean what's not to like, soft socks for the feet seems like a no brainer.  Unfortunately, these just did not meet my expectations.  They started soft, but with each subsequent washing that has reduced significantly (cold water wash, dry on normal).  The big problem, though is that they have not retained their shape, at all well.  They sag and droop and (in just a couple of months) have become pretty much unwearable."
2.0,Decia que era plata pero se puso color cobrizo en la parte de atras y la oreja de mi hija tuve que ponerle antibiótico en crema
2.0,The measurements that were stated in the listing were way off.  I usually wear a 10-12 but I am a DD on top.  The measurements told me I needed a 2x.  It was like a bag.  They also somehow doubled my order AND sent me both of them in red not green...
2.0,"I saw the pictures of other ladies who had worn this and they looked gorgeous so I was confident it would be nice. It is extremely cheaply made, which you get what you pay for in this instance, but it is very shear and VERY thin material, so be sure to keep that in mind when ordering. It can definitely be made cute given all the right things (nice slip, etc.) but purchasing a slip was not worth it given the price of the item, just wasn’t worth investing in for me."
2.0,"I am a small in 99% of the clothes I buy. I ordered the small and it was too small. I then ordered the medium and it fit identically to the small, no difference. That was disappointing as I did like the shirt otherwise"
2.0,"Were smaller than I thought. Not easy to stretch over my whole head, not what I expected."
2.0,"I usually take an US-size ""M"" in shirts.  The ""US""-size in this brand has an 18"" collar, which is all out of proportion with the body.<br />What kind of bull-necked wearer is the manufacturer expecting to buy this shirt ?<br />No choice of a ""small""size is offered to the shopper."
2.0,missing one the stones on the pendent
2.0,not the quality i had hoped for.
2.0,Come  off  your head  real  easy. Have  fold over twice  for  it on stay especially while in bed.
2.0,"Feels very plastic-like, like if it'll break easily, color is purple (not true to original).<br /><br />Will look for another option"
2.0,"Bought these for my gf—didn’t realize they were covered in glitter (which gets everywhere, forever). Maybe it’s the glittery surface—she says they are stiff and scratchy, not soft like other stance socks she has. She does not like them."
2.0,"Bought these for my wife’s new Apple watch. First band we tried wouldn’t lock into watch. Realized it was missing the center locking pin on the band. Unfortunately, I am one day past the return/exchange window. Will be looking for another brand."
2.0,Looks cheap. Seam directly down the front of the dress is not pretty.  Looks very cheap and you can really see how the fabric sewn together doesn't match up.
2.0,This product ripped down the side my first time wearing it - low quality - do not buy returning it tomorrow!
2.0,Pretty color but too short.
2.0,Picture looks better
2.0,Not as described  super long fake zip pockets on the side. Why?
2.0,Looks bigger in the pics
2.0,"They are super cute but, they broke less than 24 hours of getting them 😢😢"
2.0,The bottom of the t-shirt starts rolling up by itself.  Careful when you wash it-  it shrinks.
2.0,Cheap and too small
2.0,"Not sure if the dress was too big for me but the amount of cleavage was a little too much for me. Material is very comfortable though so I think it’d be great, if you find your size."
2.0,"The color and the fabric are great...unfortunately the cut is absurd. I read the reviews about the small sizes so I ordered a medium when I usually wear a small. The shoulders fit properly, but the sleeves were nearly 3/4 sleeves! On top of all this, the waist was almost twice what I needed. I can't imagine that someone with the waist size that would fit the jacket would be able to fit the shoulders and sleeves. The flap on the right breast is strange as well but not a deal breaker."
2.0,"Quality was fine, but these are definitely not 20g"
2.0,"Can't fit cell in strap, pocket is very small so I returned it."
2.0,"Cute shirt nice material however the shirt was super long, to the knees..."
2.0,These are sized too small
2.0,We need clothes made in USA
2.0,"The top is way too small, can't move my arms, but the pants are huge"
2.0,Broke within a month of having it.
2.0,Its good but the balls are too small and the ball falls off.
2.0,"I ordered this set specifically for the Labret studs. I was super disappointed. They are so SHORT. They didn’t even come out the other side of my chin. I have a pretty standard size chin, no excess fat etc. I’ve had my labret pierced for 20 plus years and bought tons of jewelry for it over the years and never ever seen ones this short or that didn’t fit. Most are so long on me that they stick out. I thought since the balls etc were so pretty maybe I could at least put them on the current one I have In but no luck they didn’t fit. Super disappointed and the only reason this is even getting 2 stars is because the jewelry is super pretty and you get a lot of it for the price."
2.0,"Delivery was good. The fit, comfort and function of this mask type is why I repurchased this style. I purchased the masks from another seller.  These masks looking and working identically, smelled like pesticides. I'm not claiming to know this what is was it took an extraordinary among is soaking, scrubbing, rinsing and repeating the process with airing out for days to get the smell out.  The mask is functioning fine. A smell in material from China usually comes out with several hot water and soap scrubs, rinses and airing out. For these masks the smell was unusually stubborn and time consuming to remove."
2.0,"Insoles weren't as soft as they stated,  won't buy  again."
2.0,"Beautiful, but too small"
2.0,"Very cool dress, but you cant wear it as a dress unless you like ur ass hanging out. Looks cool with legging and a pair of boots!"
2.0,"legs are tight (and I don't have large legs/thigs) -- and the waist is way too big.  Disappointing, but probably can't expect a whole lot for the price/"
2.0,No actual boob cup in the top and the area was way to small for anyone with larger boobs. Otherwise a good suit.
2.0,It fits nice and long but the color I got was no where near the green I was looking for. What I received was a very bright light green that made you cringe looking at it. I guess I'll try ordering a different color and see if that turns out like it should.
2.0,"Item fit when I received it, washed it before I wore it and it shrank, now can't button top to buttons. Very disappointed!!!!"
2.0,After paying (with shipping costs) $26.00 and some change for this item<br />I certainly expected more than what I received.  I was shocked when<br />I opened the package and saw the extremely poor quality of my purchase.<br />The bracelet looked as though it had been purchased at a 99 cent store. I<br />returned it for a refund immediately.
2.0,The item came packaged in a tiny bag for an item with a tutu skirt its was completely flattened. The skirt did puff out reasonably ok but the material for the skirt is shredding off and tiny particles of the green skirt were all over the white onsie. A lint roller will solve this problem BUT I would never give a baby anything that produces particle like that. They can inhale it of if she got ahokd of the skirt it seems like she could pull off a handful of it. Also the little ribbon looks like it was applied with hot glue after the fact and there was glue all over the ribbon and rhinestone. Also there was a glob og glue on the shamrock applique
2.0,I have a bunch of these bought from the true local artists and was looking for one more to make a set of 5 for my last piercing. But this one is just not the real thing. It looks like it’s made from the cheapest silver alloy possible and thinnest possibly silver sheet.
2.0,"Probably it is original, but the frame are very thin and delicate plastic, not for daily wearing, probably won't serve you for a long time"
2.0,everyone of the socks had 2 to 3 pulls in them
2.0,"I have bought a few of these acoustic guitar strap buttons by Walker & Williams, and have always been satisfied. I bought this one recently, and noticed in the picture that it uses a different button than the others. While it affects the aesthetics of the strap (the other buttons are better looking), it really wan’t much of a big deal to me. The strap came today, and upon trying to install it, the button broke off. I originally planned on returning the broken product, but instead decided to just remove the button completely, and use a strap shoelace to attach it to a guitar strap. If it doesn’t work, I’ll probably just buy another one, but make sure it has the older, OTHER button that has always worked well."
2.0,"Its a pretty blouse, but unfortunately the sleeves were damage. (Pardon me, english its not my first language). There was no elastic on the sleeves."
2.0,Incredibly small. Female watch or child watch.
2.0,"If color matters to you, be aware that the product is actually very yellow rather than ivory/pale yellow shown in the photo. I had to return it because of this, so I can't speak to any other details of the bustle."
2.0,Gave to my son
2.0,Not worth your money!! They hurt!!
2.0,I understood the description to say there were 3 polishing cloths included by I only received 2.
2.0,Inexpensinve and for a reason. I've had two. Both have come apart within two days. Now I know why. The end of the leather straps are GLUED together and evidentally not with water proof tape! The first one I threw away as I thought the strap had broke. When the second one came apart I investigated closely and discovered the glued ends of the straps. I used super glue to repair. The next weak point is the clasp: it is hard to get closed without help but comes unclasped and falls off within an hour of use! I tape the clasp shut so as not to lose it.
2.0,"I don't think these sunglasses should be priced more than $20-$25. They have a high inner reflection (I can see my own eyes on the inside of the lenses). The tint of the lenses is medium (not dark), but adequately reduces glare. The frames and lenses are very lightweight. I have a small women's head and these glasses ""fit"" my head and do not slip with side to side or up and down head movements. I ordered these for a backup pair for my young adult son. I'm not so sure he will like them or wear them because the only sunglasses he has ever had has been one pair of Serengeti's. These glasses just do not hold a candle to the phenomenal quality of Serengeti's. These would be okay for use in water or active sports where you wouldn't want to damage or lose better quality sunglasses."
2.0,The back does not stay on tight. It opened twice and all my charms fell out.
2.0,Ordered these as a gift for Christmas. My daughter is in a size 13 right now and that's what we ordered. However these size 13 are way to large. My daughter was so upset that she could  not wear them. Now we have to return them and they no longer have a smaller size that will fit her.
2.0,"It's not cotton, it's a thin polyester. It runs a little small. I returned it. Cute idea,  poor fabric choice."
2.0,This shirt seems to be well made.  The design is attractive and the material has a stretch to it.  But I ordered an XL and got a L so it is too small and I can't really judge.  Irritating to not get what you ordered.
2.0,This band is perfect for special occasions. I like the way it has a quick-release to change the band.<br />*** yep you get a change out but it already broke now I can't use it
2.0,Already broke it....
2.0,This shirt is nothing like the picture. It is such thin material and not made well. I expected more from its look. Also if u are under 5’4” it’s too long and the front flap looks like a diaper. Not satisfied at all.
2.0,It’s disappointing that whatever protective layer/film that are on the lenses is coming off after only 2 months of wear. I clean them with warm water and hand soap under the faucet so maybe they can’t stand up to regular hand soap?
2.0,"I purchased a large, but the hoodie I got was definitely an XL or possibly even a XXL. I really liked the style but I don't think I can walk around with a ridiculously oversized hoodie."
2.0,Color doesn't match the picture.
2.0,Second week of classes and the seams along the back came open then two days later the thread holding the strap on broke. Looked good but low quality.
2.0,No tengo medidas perfectas así que no me favoreció. Pero el print es hermoso.
2.0,"I just received my band today and I quickly changed it out.  Two things that bug me:  1) the band sticks out a bit where it connects to the watch on both ends and 2) the color is gray and not white!  I was expecting a white band since that’s what I selected and it shows as the description, but in reality it’s gray.  Neither issue are a huge deal breaker, but disappointing nonetheless."
2.0,I really like the shirt but the XL fits more like a medium so I can't wear it.
2.0,"Looked nice, lasted about a week when it unhooked from my pants and split into pieces"
2.0,"Looks cute, but not good quality.  It doesn't hold what I need it to and it falls apart easily."
2.0,Very ugly not as picture
2.0,"The look and feel out of the packaging is very nice, but the fit is way off.  The bra is way too small and I followed the sizing guide.  Also, there is no support from the band.  The band stretches and the girls fall straight through the bottom.  I had high hopes, but had to return it."
2.0,Runs small. My daughter cannot wear them. She is 11 years old and usually wears 10-12 in girls. These were WAY too small. She couldn't pull them up all the way.
2.0,"First off, I'm super disappointed! Loved the color and style, but there's no darts in the bust, it smashes the girls in the middle and no amount of rearranging could fix the problem. My bottom is larger than my top, so when that part fits the top should ALWAYS be fine, (it's usually the lower portion that is too tight,) but the skirt fit fine and was very flattering.<br />I was going to try the next size up, but when looking closer to the pictures online I see the same problem, so I don't think it would make a difference.<br />Nice dress for the flat chested!"
2.0,Got the shirt for my wife. It looked great but was way small
2.0,Way too big Size down if you can. I purchased a smaller size and I was swimming in his shirt really upset because it was actually cute and had a perfect scoop neck.
2.0,It is too long. I need to have it shortened.
2.0,"Package came indicating ""imitation jewelry"".  Description noted ""genuine birthstone"" and ""sterling silver"".  Ring does not look like sterling silver either.  It is a pretty ring but it looks silver plated.  It also is thick and uncomfortable."
2.0,The chain is pretty long and good quality although the pendant is a little thin.
2.0,Very pretty but the stone fell out the first day.
2.0,"Cheap knockoff. Terrible material, and wrong sizing."
2.0,Water runs right through these pants after a while in the rain.  Don't try to spend any duration outside such as a sporting event.
2.0,They are not big enough.  Squished my nose.
2.0,the top cover for the hard case has not clamps or clips to keep it onto the laptop. all the other pieces of the bundle were fine.
2.0,"Even after washing the top, it bled onto my skin and my favorite PINK sweatshirt I wore to the pool. The bottoms are a bit saggy unless you really hike them up. The top gave a little underboob/ side boob so I had to tie it in a certain way to make it work. I wore it twice, but after dying my skin and my sweatshirt I’ll be returning it. Cute suit though, I don’t know if I got one from a bad batch or if this happens with all of them. Size medium, 110 pounds, 5’1, 32/34C"
2.0,Not at all what is pictured. I ordered an XL (I’m a size 10 pants but my bust is a 36 H) and it fits like a Medium. The material is thick and stiff and the black is very dark where as the picture shows a flowy worn look. May work for others but I’m large chested and it did not work for me at all.
2.0,"Very cute bracelet, but unfortunately the item broke with 4 days.  If ordering I would be careful<br />on whether you choose this"
2.0,"The ring is pretty. However, it was broken. Will be returning"
2.0,I ordered a small and it’s super lard and wide in width
2.0,"I had the usual problems with the motors shutting off, but they restore easily. Moving the control sticks to the lower right position until it beeps resets them. They shut off as protection from stalled blades, and you only get a few tries. After that limit, the motor drivers burn out, no choice but to buy a new circuit board. The board looks to be about $20 US, but you'll need to solder the motors in."
2.0,They fit but they’re made for a toddler. They’re so tiny! It’ll do for the time being. Meh.
2.0,Like the style but one the the ties was frayed when I received it and is not wearable.
2.0,Yoga bag too small can’t fit mat.
2.0,The waistband inside turns all crooked after we washed it. That was very frustrating because it became uncomfortable to wear
2.0,i LOVED IT...BUT LOST IT AFTER 1 WEEK it did not fit snug enough in the jack to stay secure which I was afraid of lost my little foxy :(
2.0,"I wanted to like this sweater ,I'm a 5'5&#34; size 2 and this sweater was not slouchy. The sleeves are short and the waistline is fitted and ends right at the waist snugly, in the photo it looks as though its slouchy and much longer this is not what I received :( Disappointed, I wish the sleeves weren't 3/4 length. The sweater stretched and lost its shape when I did wear it :( The back opening does not drop as low as in the photo. Cute for a fitted ,short sweater but it wasn't what I was expecting when I purchased this sweater."
2.0,Wouldn't fit nose still hurts a lot been done since March. I still have it and will keep it until Blue to use it
2.0,"I love the separate sequined bralette, it's not meant to be worn as a bra but is extremely versatile and very cute under just about any low cut top. The black overshirt was extremely small, had no sewed hemline to be found and seemed to have been cut crooked. I'd purchase the sequined section on its own for all of its benefits, it's the overshirt I could have done without."
2.0,Necklace is nive its just that the chain turns colors as in rust.
2.0,"I really liked the idea of these shoes but they are so wide that I'm not sure they would fit any child's foot. My daughter wears a 10 toddler in shoes and while these were just a tad long, they were extremely wide. Sent both pairs back."
2.0,Material very very thin and to tight.
2.0,Looked nice out of the bag but way too smal compared to sizes on the size chart.
2.0,"Very pretty socks. If you have hot feet, I see how the metal can direct heat back. But if you have chilly feet usually, they take on the cold and have no heat to reflect back. Quite thin. Actually think they may work with socks that keep air in, but I can do that with 2 pair of reg sox."
2.0,I took this out of the bag & immediately put it back in. I have many Grace Karin sweaters & this feels nothing like the others - it’s scratchy to the touch - I can’t imagine how it would feel once actually on.
2.0,Hardly covers my butt. But really cute
2.0,"I am 106 lbs; 33, 25, 35. Chinese M usu fits me perfectly, but in this case it's more then sizing. I think the photo explains everything 🤣<br /><br />This company is a hit or a miss. If it's a hit, the garments are beautiful. If it's a miss, well, yeah..."
2.0,"I was excited to get these, they seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.. sadly the first time I put them on I noticed a whitish patch on the side of one leg (pic) then after a 10 minuet walk the color rubbed right off leaving a white streak across both calves of the pant (pic). The rise was also much shorter than I expected"
2.0,Very pretty online . When received the ring looked worn and rusted like it has been worn  before . The description claimed to be sterling silver but the condition the ring came in contradicts the description . Don't recommend
2.0,I was disappointed. They were not what I expected. I guess too late to return. Wish I had ordered just some cheap cheater sunglasses.
2.0,Too small and they don’t stretch much.
2.0,It's doesn't fit like what in pic<br />Fits big
2.0,Love the color! Looks great! I wear a 8 women's but I ordered a man's 9 very small! They are very hard! I have back problems & my back is already hurting! U can't stand long u have 2 move from 1 leg to another to keep ur back from hurting! I don't know if I can wear! Dang! I had a pair of colgo sandals! Loved them but after 6 months they fell apart! Was replacing them with theses but I have sciatic nerve problems! Another waste of money with Amazon! Amazon sells junk!
2.0,"The chain is not silver, mine was blackish silver material, cheap like you'd get at a carnival or out of a machine.  And the plastic ball inside is NOT turquoise.  Super disappointed."
2.0,"I loved this watch when arrived, I was very happy with a look and how comfortable it was on my wrist but……. I was swimming in my pool two times and it’s all foggy and water inside.. such a disappointment. I’m not sure if that happened only to me but it’s not worth that money. It’s not very expensive watch but for that money you expect more."
2.0,I returned this because the fit was tight and the armpits being so large was awkward on me.
2.0,disappointed  very thin...wore it for one day and lost both earrings
2.0,"This mood locket is cute. The mood change can happen just from the back of it being on your skin.<br /><br />However, the one I received looked used. Some of plating was chipped around the edges (it doesn't really show well in the pictures). Also,the inside looked like it might have had glue or something in it at some point."
2.0,"Top is nice, soft but slightly see through"
2.0,more junk looks so beautiful in this picture and it is NOT
2.0,These gloves are pretty sick! Size is perfect and the warmth is great!<br />Was not paid for this review btw!<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW;<br />  These do not hold up well in below freezing temperatures. I took them skiing in Vail CO and my hands were BRUTALLY cold. I had to take pit stops at the lodges to warm my hands up when I was able to.
2.0,This shirt took forever to arrive. It is made from a thin athletic fabric—not what I was expecting.
2.0,Size was way to big than how ad how it written
2.0,The open shoulder top too looked a little off with the open shoulders not fitting on my arms well. I had to return it.
2.0,These things look very rough. If you are expecting something that looks halfway decent you will be greatly disappointed. I would consider this more of a toy for children than jewelry.
2.0,"The shirt would be nice if the print ""Honey"" wasn't so high it sits just below the neck and it looks a bit odd.  The lettering should be lower on the tank top.  This is the only reason I am returning this top.  Otherwise, it's a great idea...just center the print in the middle instead of the top."
2.0,Didn’t love them. They’re very thin and the material sticks to your face where you can see the outline of your lips and all. It just looks funky and too thin. Doesn’t feel very effective.
2.0,I had to return this. The price is not worth it. I was expecting very long scarves but the scarf barely went around the circumference of my head.
2.0,It exposed a lot more than I thought it would.  The chest area was just a little too loose and showed side/under-b**b.  The back was very open - didn't cover much on the side.  Wasn't as flattering as I thought it would be and didn't have enough coverage.
2.0,Lightweight and cheap looking. I was very disappointed. Smallish and holds very little.
2.0,I am not impressed
2.0,"This beautiful print dress that is very inexpensive. However, it arrived with wrinkles that were very difficult to remove. I washed it then pressed hard with a warm iron to smooth the soft beige floral fabric. I ordered an XL since I am 5' 11 1/2"" tall and weigh 170 lbs, usually a size 14 misses fits well. The bodice is only 14"" long (measured from the middle of the neckline, unfortunately rests 3"" above my natural waist. See my profile photo, my hand is on my waist. The short bodice results in my waist appearing larger than it actually is. If I had tried it on in a store I would NOT have purchased it. However, by wearing a 24"" petticoat under the 26"" skirt results in an acceptable look so I am keeping it. The fabric is thin, so a full white slip in additional to the petticoat enhances the appearance of the dress."
2.0,The backs fall off. We have lost a few since purchasing.
2.0,"This dress fit me as good as a blanket. 😞 I wanted so much to love it. The texture was great, the color lovely. But the sizing is really just off. A small fit me like an extra large. (I am 5'2 115 lbs for comparison.)"
2.0,"Don’t get me wrong I used to love these when I was a kid, but these ones are just way too small and you need to make bigger ones like 20 inch maybe, but not only that, the buckles suck, they are very tight and hard to get apart, especially if you don’t have long fingernails they smack your nail and It really hurts once trying to get the buckle apart, if your and adult ordering them for yourself go find bigger ones because the 18” ones are just to small"
2.0,"This pair of socks is... unique.<br />It's crew height, so more of an athletic style, but then it's patterned like a dress sock.<br />The male response here was that your leg will show when you sit with dress pants & they wouldn't wear dark gray w/ blue & red stripes to the gym or with shorts!<br />The fabric is decent with a good amount of stretch & softness, but the height & the styling is... odd."
2.0,Graphic only looks good when you aren’t wearing the socks.
2.0,Tigger was a sticker/iron on transfer. I have Piglet & Eeyore hats that are stitched. Those hats were comparable in price.
2.0,"I purchased these thinking they would help with nighttime glare. After looking at several different pair, I decided on this one with all the rave reviews. I must say, the packaging alone is worth the price you pay for these! They have better packaging than most designer glasses. However, after using them for multiple nights, in the rain, in the snow, etc.. I returned them. They didn't seem to help the glare of nighttime driving at all. They just made everything bright yellow in color. I was greatly disappointed!!"
2.0,[[ASIN:B0026TASQO Rose Scented Carved Rose Petal Rosary]]<br /><br />I was very disappointed when I've received the rosary.  It did not have the crucifix.
2.0,The sleeves are too tight
2.0,Very pretty on the web but very small
2.0,"They're comfortable but overall I don't think it's worth the money. First, the fabric started to look worn out after two washes on cold delicate. Second, the ballpark sack didn't keep my sack in the sack."
2.0,"It was way thinner than I expected, essentially see through.  It was also really flimsy."
2.0,It seems good
2.0,"Its really nice and warm but the unfinished collar and bottom edge is nooot it. looks kind of awful, if you care about that"
2.0,From band to crown to short.<br />.  0
2.0,"Omg, when I was mowing the lawn I hit my nose (not even hard) and the pain to the bridge of my nose was so painful it actually made me stop mowing. It was horrible. The day glasses are great otherwise, a lil cushion on the bride would make these a 5 star to me."
2.0,A stone was missing when I received it.
2.0,"I liked the way they were made, and looked, but were cheaply made. They lasted less than two weeks before they fell apart."
2.0,poor quality did not hold up
2.0,"The space between the fingers and the toes pinch so bad.  They could hardly be worn.  I took scissors and clipped the piece between and now they have holes in them between all the fingers but now I dont wanna cry when doing downward dog with sweaty hands.  Much more comfortable now.  Just wont last long at all this way, guessing one wash."
2.0,"Poorly made, 4 of the stones snapped off after about a month."
2.0,The print and design on the sock looks great right out of the bag. The sock looks grey instead of black and print looks faded when worn due to the inside of the sock is white. I do not recommend.
2.0,"If you would like some polka-dot socks to amuse your friends, these are it.  If you truly want/need compression socks look elsewhere.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fits true to size in length and height<br />- Colorful, festive polka-dot pattern with some great colors<br /><br />Con:<br />- Lacks compression<br /><br />I decided to try these out on my husband, who wears Size L socks.  They fit just right in terms of length and knee height.  They were easy to get on, but there is no detectable compression.<br /><br />They feel and look like regular casual socks.  If you would like a pair of multicolored polka-dot novelty socks, these would be a great choice.  They have purple, gold, teal, and blue dots on a white background (as pictured), and Halloween is approaching.  You will definitely stand out in a crowd if you don these.  Unfortunately for those looking for compression, these do not compress any more than a regular sock of the same size."
2.0,"I received this recently and although the quality is as expected the rose quartz isn't very rose, it's almost clear with a slight pink tint, which although it is still pretty it's not what I wanted. Others are nice though."
2.0,"Out of the box the left ear grip came off, and ever so slowly did the right one go as well, they were adhered with a cheep glue that was visible on the outside of the grips of the ear. These only lasted a week before I was fed up with them"
2.0,"I ordered the dress in green, the color and the texture doesn't look at all like the image. It looks ok, the size is ok but the color is greyish-green. Disappointed"
2.0,"Cute dress, saw that it ran small so order a size up but I would recommend 2 sizes up.  Ended up sending it back."
2.0,low raise pants. i don't like that for athletic pants because it makes them slide down the butt when you squat. I got those in gray and they are see through on the butt. returning them.
2.0,My Gf wanted this. Bought it about one month ago. Already tore on the inside.
2.0,"Not flattering.  Frumpy looking, waist is wide and high. The photo shows the waist more tapered. The dress has no shape and if you have larger boobs, it will look like a maternity dress. The material is fine, I just can't get over the shape/wide high waist. Not for me.  Returning it."
2.0,"The design of these suspenders - the fabric, color, and mode of attaching in back are all good. But all of that means nothing if the suspender clasps will not stay attached. They don't. The two rear clasps held okay, but neither of the front clasps would stay attached to my jeans for more than a few minutes. I am over six feet tall, weigh 230 but am not obese. The suspenders were not stretched tight - barely tight enough to do the job.  I have ordered a different brand of suspenders with a  better track record and will replace the two failed clasps also with a different brand."
2.0,The material is extremely cheap nothing like what i order online.
2.0,"did not fit, material is cheap"
2.0,These are actually slippery so not that great for tree poses etc
2.0,"Item fits great and feels nice. However, I wore the first one and it was great I had no issues with it. The second day came and I went to put on another one which was the navy lace with the pink and looks like someone cut one side of the clasp completely off. Went to grab another one to put on and the front of it was ripped. I contacted the seller letting them know of the defect and asked for replacements because I preferred having the item over a refund. Well they  refunded me $9 and some change for the two with defects which I wasn't happy about but I could deal. The next day I put on another one and while wearing it the bra ripped while I was at work (I work at a desk so there was no strenuous activity or anything). So now I only have 3 of the 6 left and I haven't tested two of them yet. They are really cute but obviously very cheaply made."
2.0,color and pattern looks different in person
2.0,The look of these is really nice. I did buy them because they are supposed to be hypoallergenic but they do give me a weird metal smell on my ears and they are probably leaching into my skin also. For these reasons I would not repurchase.
2.0,Not really comfortable. I've had them maybe a month or so and the insoles are completely flat with no support.
2.0,It was too small for my arm but nice as a gift
2.0,"these are flimsy and cheaply made, mine arrive broken in half!"
2.0,These are way too thick to be comfortable.  They feel hard and not breathable.  The regular cheap medical masks are much better.  These feel like you are wearing construction paper.<br /><br />If you want a very thick mask you might like these.
2.0,These were to big for my daughters nose if your are a petite person they maybe big she wanted a snug fit
2.0,Disappointed the Christmas gift came with broken earrings. The necklace broke as well while waiting on the return info. Price is good but as expected not made in the USA.
2.0,Love the feeling of them just wish I had read a little better thought I was getting all socks in the picture and was very disappointed when I only received one pair of your only getting one pair at least it would have been nice to pick the pair you wanted
2.0,No back clip is a problem
2.0,Showed up on time. Unfortunately it’s too large. I recommend ordering a size smaller than the child is currently wearing. Pants are extremely long
2.0,"Although the waist size was as expected, the pants were huge in the hips and thighs. I returned them and got a refund for the original price. I was not reimbursed for the $11.00 that I paid for return postage."
2.0,Was told it was easy to adjust this band but it's not. Will have to take to a watch shop.
2.0,See through material not a great skirt
2.0,I bought one and had only worn it a couple times before an antler broke. Ordered another one and received it broken. Packaging was exceedingly poor. I won’t try again.
2.0,This product is almost see through
2.0,I normally wear size 12 so I ordered an XL and it was too small and tight. Also was too short so I had to return the item.
2.0,"I am between a large and a medium. I got the large and it was ginormous!!!!! It could fit two of me under the arms. I tried to return it and the supplier sent me a message in broken English. They tried to convince me to keep it or give it to a friend. They actually said that!!!! Also, if I tried to return it they told me I would need to pay shipping. It isn’t an Amazon product.  The fabric is thin, but the graphic is cute. I’d avoid this seller until he future."
2.0,"This product was cute but too small. It fit pretty well I'm the width but was too short. I am 5'6 and am a size 12 and even ordered a size up, the XXXL and I could not get the straps over my shoulders. Will definitely have to return it, the material was ok, not the best but not the worst either. I ordered the red and it was a much brighter shade than in the picture, kind of took away from the vintage look. For the price I guess it was as expected."
2.0,"The size of these pants seems to fit right, but the inseam is short! I could have sworn I checked the inseam length, because I have longer legs for a 5'4"" person.  These feel like 29"" inseams.  Can't wear these to work with flip flops ... I kept them anyway ... I guess they'll do if I miss laundry day."
2.0,came with a hole in the butt...
2.0,print and color as expected but the dress does not fit on body poorly tailored
2.0,Looks real in photo is plastic and big. Kids might like. Was hoping metal
2.0,Returned...not good at alll!!!
2.0,"Unfortunately the button, buttons or clip at the back of the romper was missing .. I had to take it to a tailor which  cost me $25 to add a bottom on the back of the romper."
2.0,Bottle was partially unscrewed. Nearly ⅓ of the product was in the bottom of the bag
2.0,Wore out in 4 rounds of golf
2.0,"I like these earrings so much that I had to buy this second pair to repair my first. The charms fall off easily. I lost a few the first time I wore them, so.....that’s not good. But they sure are cute."
2.0,Got to my destination but zipper promptly broke
2.0,The review on this is true as far as the map being reversed on the back. I did find the fit to be good however the bottom is too boxy to leave untucked. The worst thing about this shirt is the material. It is AWFUL. I just returned from a trip in cold weather that I bought this shirt for and I was sweating. I had to go back to the hotel and change! I just couldn’t get my body temperature to cool down in the shirt.I’m pretty disappointed because the shirt looks adorable on the website.
2.0,Items is exactly as described and what I want BUT has a horrible chemical odor!! I've left it out for a week now in hopes it would eventually go away. Unfortunately it has not. It's so bad it makes me sick. Very disappointed.
2.0,"So sad to realize that the quality they use be made is not the same. I had a pair couple of years ago, it last long strong and durable. These look like a Dollar Tree one😓"
2.0,"It's a nice dress for the first few times you wear it and after you wash it, it gets short and goes above the ankle. Like an awkward length... If your short it's perfect for you!"
2.0,Did not come in original packaging like pictures and not great quality.
2.0,I ordered a size small and it was still way too large
2.0,"Pretty color and design, but the fabric is rough,'scratchy and hot/makes you sweat even though it's a bit sheer."
2.0,"Ordered xl. Size was small or maybe medium. Nice shirt, gave it to very thin friend. She loves is. She wears mostly smalls."
2.0,Disappointed in this item. The two end metal pieces were a different color & the wrap bands did not lay flat.
2.0,"I normally wear a small to extra small in dresses but this was super tight in the shoulders. It didn't have much stretch. If you lift weights and have broad or round, filled out shoulders like I do, I would recommend ordering a size up."
2.0,"Bought 7 pairs total among the groomsmen and fathers in my wedding. Of these, 2 individuals had the stems snap off of the back of the face. The first happened at the church and the other after the ceremony. Both with minimal wear and no strain on the cufflinks. Otherwise they were good looking and appeared to be fair quality, but I guess looks can be deceiving."
2.0,"Of the 50, I only go 38 in the box and only 10 worked straight out of the box. The others were either in pieces or just didn't work."
2.0,"These are fine for about 10 miles... the padding isn't the best quality and after a while is not effective. After a few very sore 20mile rides, I retired them. I keep them on hand for short rides only"
2.0,It was super cute and comfy but way to see through. Had to return.
2.0,"The further away you are, the prettier the necklace. Up close, this necklace looks very flimsy. I'd pass on this one for it's price."
2.0,3 or 4 sizes too small. Coarse soft fabric.
2.0,"I bought this costume due to the great reviews but it was so uncomfortable that I didn't even wear it other than trying it on. It must be made for people 5' and under. At 5'3 it was awkward. I had to pull the leg material all the way up, as far as it would go, to allow all the extra space for my torso and for my head to reach the neck opening. There is no easy way to put on this costume  on and I'm pretty sure I gave myself a kink in the neck trying to maneuver my head into the neck opening. Instead of fully unzipping you have to shove your head into a tiny covered pocket-like opening...it's so weird and uncomfortable. The look of the costume is 💯 which is why it's receiving any stars at all."
2.0,"Fit perfectly, but pills very easily after washing"
2.0,"This was more comfortable for my daughter than other options, but the color rubbed off in about 3 weeks. Not very good quality."
2.0,This braclet is pretty but with in 2 days the charm broke and came off it was poorly made
2.0,To hard to adjust. Screw design impossible to adjust on the garment.
2.0,The hat fit well but it sweat stained/ faded out really fast. It was worn daily for less than a month and looks like this now. Hand washed a couple of times but that did not help. It started out looking just like advertised.
2.0,Go up 2 to 3 sizes
2.0,"It looks great, but immediately turned my wrist green. Will be returning."
2.0,"This watch looks really good and can go with any of your outfits.  However, one day it fell out of my hands and dropped about 2 feet. The entire inside fell apart. All the hands fell off."
2.0,"I have other Sak purses and they have held up fabulously over the years.  This one, however, leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />I bought this as a gift for a friend.  She used it for a few days and the sequins lining the top border of the purse started coming off.<br /><br />This gets two stars instead of one because I love The Sak brand and the purse itself is beautiful.  The orange sequins that show through the holes of the purse are an appealing touch for me.<br /><br />Returning for refund."
2.0,It's ok. Feels somewhat cheap. Arrived without earrings even though I specifically ordered the ser. Returning.
2.0,"Very cute and comfy but pills something awful! Was going to buy in more colors as I liked it so much, but not now that I see how bad it pills. It ruins the look of the top and is too much to shave off with the pilling tool as it’s all over the top, not just the usual places; it has pilled all over the chest/front! I wear it around the house or to bed as PJ top."
2.0,The backpack in this picture is what ordered. The one I received has a blue background behind the lace and BRIGHT pink trim. Wouldnt have ordered the one I received. Only keeping it because my daughter wants it for school starting in a couple days and she and her friend are emma and chloe. So....
2.0,"I was really looking forward to getting this shirt. I wish it had said it was shipping from China. It took over 2 months to arrive. Before I tried it on, I read what it was made of (cotton and polyester). I had ordered an XL, thinking that it would be plenty big. I was wrong. It fits more like a medium, to a large. The last thing I want to do is send it back for a bigger size, because it took so long to arrive. I am very disappointed."
2.0,"It fit fine and the fabric feels good against the skin, but it looks extremely cheap. Good for lounging I guess, but I would not go out in public wearing it."
2.0,"Unfortunately, after wearing in the evenings for about two weeks, one has developed a hole at the heel.  The hole is not on the sole, but at the back of the heel.  A manufacturing quality issue for sure, that is now letting the stuffing out."
2.0,The size is slightly smaller than expected and the material is very thin. Not really thrilled with it.
2.0,"I'm 5' 9&#34; and shorts are below my knees. The waist fits but they pucker in the crotch.  Ironically, the material is exactly what I wanted but unusual cut makes them unwearable."
2.0,"Well this was cute and all but it looked like the larger version, this one is just a bit to small to actually be of use"
2.0,"Item arrived with broken stitching along the wrist. It's cheap as hell, so I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,The top is weird.. It screws on odd
2.0,"Cheap material. Washed once and it didn't shrink much. However, the feel of the material is uncomfortable. Also, it tends to shrink/wrinkle as you wear it so the sleeves started to ride up. Threw it away after 2 wears...wouldn't order again and wish I didn't order once. Sometimes you find deals, sometimes you get what you paid for. If they improved the material, this would be a great find. The style was what I was looking for."
2.0,Shirt fits small looks flimsy doesn't look dressy at all
2.0,"I have not put in on yet, do not like the waist and does not feel soft."
2.0,"The pockets are really poofy and it makes you look like a balloon (not good)<br />Plus, it took about 2 months to arrive. Wayyyy too long and wasn't worth the wait."
2.0,"I'd imagine these dresses could be super cute if you had a good hand for alterations and could nip them in at the waist a little. I don't have a particularly small waist, but the dress just kind of hung off of me with no curve or shape to it at all. Wasn't a fan of the look. Color was really nice though, and the fabric was very soft."
2.0,They're cute but The pompoms' came  off I only had them for a week.
2.0,Cute boot and style. They may be leather but feel more like a imitation leather. Rubbery like.
2.0,"Overall, this dress was pretty shapeless , even on a curvy woman like me. The material and lace, though soft, looked cheap."
2.0,Great looking band.<br />Case is too big and you can’t operate the round button on the watch
2.0,It is not what is pictured above it has 2 sets of brown instead of 3. But overall the product is very warm  and they fit perfect. I have large calves so that’s saying something
2.0,"Looks nothing like the picture. In color or style. Material is soft but on the heavier side. I expected this dress to be sort of harem style based on the picture but it's just a plain,almost white, grey maxi dress with really out of place pockets. Pretty mad that I spent $20 on a dress that's probably only worth half that and that I have to see and fix myself to try to salvage the purchase. But you can't win them all."
2.0,Bracelet was way to small.
2.0,"For the price this 14k gold charm is not worth the money.  It is very light weight and looks, feels, sounds, inexpensive. Rembrandt  Gold Charms are not what they use to be- the new ones seem to be a less quality than the ones I bought in the past- perhaps they're using less gold to make the charms."
2.0,"The shirt is nice in appearance, but it is very constricting and shrinks. I really liked the look even though it was pretty snug at first, but after washing it shrunk (which I was not expecting) and is now way to tight. If you purchase get a size larger than normal and wash it before your return period has expired in case you need to return it. Unfortunately I learned this the hard way and had to eat almost $150, which is what I paid for all of these shirts."
2.0,too small around calf
2.0,Amazing glasses. Can not be happier. Just a little big. But they are great at blocking out the sun. Love the case it comes with. Good to help protect them. I cant complain for a $20 pair of glasses<br /><br />Update. Left arm fell off the glasses. First week  in iraq. Was a great pair of glasses to bad they broke.
2.0,I am very happy with my purchase I would recommend
2.0,Cheap looking...
2.0,"It is nice dress, but the fabric is thin and shows ALL body imperfections. Maybe it looks better in darker colors."
2.0,The dress looks great in the picture but it does not fit that well. I am bigger in the hip area and this dress was too tight. The lines looked distorted. This size usually works for me but the dress proved to tight.<br /><br />The dress also looks very cheap. Will not wear again.
2.0,"I had high hopes, sadly i was disappointed the only lens that fit correctly is the one that it comes with. i tried all and all where loose but when i keep putting the one it came with back in it would fit good but none of the others would! Had to return! Ugg What a pain!"
2.0,"I have always wanted a pair of moissanite earrings. I just wish I knew there was a brighter white. They are pretty , I get more compliments on my CZ’s than these"
2.0,"Received the wrong size, ordered a medium. Received and XL and the color was more orange than red!"
2.0,Decent ring but definitely not worth its price tag. Could be $20 to $30 less.
2.0,Product is cute but definitely not true to size! Run small and for tiny lobes. Slip out easily!
2.0,Looked like I was wearing a garbage bag.. no shape to this item at all! Material was rough too!
2.0,"Horrible, barely blocks sun and made put of a cheap plastic; don't recommend this product for you will only be disappointed."
2.0,They are cute but the backs slip right off and die to the weight they fall right out of my ears
2.0,"Was happy to get these on a Lightning deal but disappointed. The front section of the pants are not properly sewn, badly matched seams.  The very top is not really finished. The material tag shows 35% cotton while the material looks and feels like 100% polyester.  My waist in not tiny or small for my size however the stretch is so loosely sewn I would be afraid the pants would fall down. The Size Small is loose & generous which would have been OK had the they been made better or stayed up.  Gave them 2* for the vibrant colors & pattern. Photos are of the front top section of the  pants & the material label."
2.0,These were definitely comfortable- just poor quality. They were thinner than expected and small rocks easily got caught in the bottoms and worked themselves up to the to the sole of my foot.. wouldn't purchase again
2.0,"While the shoulder and hip width were the correct size, the length was WAASYYYY to short. I am petite and have a short body, but this was ridiculous. I had the mega wedgie from hell! Do not buy from this seller. I bought two others from other sellers, and they fit fine all around."
2.0,The clasp that closes it broke soon after receiving.
2.0,"This bag tore very easily, causing my keys to get lost between the outer shell and the lining."
2.0,Did not fit the ear and impossible to ajust.
2.0,"Poor workmanship: weakly sew on main button, cheap metal zipper. Crap."
2.0,"Is not the color that is portrayed in photo.  Ordered a black and it looks more grey with black specs.  So if you order a black you will not get that color other than that the fit is nice, and the style is pretty."
2.0,Came with a stain on the hood.
2.0,It is a great fit but it is very poor quality. It is a fall hat. Definitely not for the winter months.
2.0,The front is nice but the back is plain red and just looks disjointed/unfinished.
2.0,"These are super cute and the designs themselves seemed to be well-made. They are lightweight and my daughter said they were pretty comfortable. However, they break very, very easily, which isn't ideal especially where they are intended for kids. The sticky material that holds the clip to the earring is not very durable and some had already broken off inside the case when this arrived. You can fix them with a little glue, but it was obnoxious that they broke so easily and my daughter lost a few that way as they fell off throughout the day as she was wearing them. Don't waste your money and buy something that actually works."
2.0,"Quality isn't good.  Thin and flimsy. Not sure it's really packable. Came out of the package bent and wrinkled, and stayed that way. Sent it back."
2.0,"if you are not 95 lbs and 5ft. 1&#34;, even the largest size is not for you."
2.0,"i am a 34D and the bra just did not fit my frame, i gave it to a donation box."
2.0,"These pants are just ok. Cheaper material than I thought they would be. If I saw them in the store, I Def wouldn't have bought them. I read reviews that they were low in the rear, and they are.  Would send back but I'm too lazy. I will just wear around the house."
2.0,Broken already!! Must of been made in CHINA…
2.0,Poor quality. I didn't even want to try.
2.0,"Pros- fit, grip, fingerless option, price<br /><br />Major Con- NO GEL CUSHION AT ALL. The ‘gel’ is dots placed on the heel of the glove for grip NOT FOR CUSION OR COMFORT OR IMPACT. These would be better suited for work out gloves NOT for bicycle riding"
2.0,Stitching of pockets and back seams fell apart after washing twice. These were loose and roomy while wearing.. and super comfy. Now only worn at home.
2.0,"Definitely need to read more comments-- don't get this if not a size 8 or smaller. While it did fit, it was really tight and uncomfortable, which is a shame since I wanted the leggings for the color, warmth and comfort. I'm 5'1&#34; and am 170 lb and typically wear size 14-16."
2.0,"I generally like small, not-so-bulky bracelets like this Ldurian Crown Woven Bracelet. The closure makes it easy to put on yourself, which is always a big plus for me with bracelets.<br /><br />But this particular bracelet has a few flaws that keep it from being one I’ll wear regularly.<br /><br />First, the bracelet I received has a really sharp edge near the closure section, which doesn’t feel great against the inside of my wrist. I can’t snip it off because then I think the whole bracelet will unravel.<br /><br />Second, the edges of the crown are also sharp. Fortunately the charm doesn’t spin around on the bracelet, but it’s still something to be aware of. The edges of the crown feel like little metal spears rather than circles.<br /><br />I have a pretty small wrist, so the bracelet is actually big on me and doesn’t fit snugly to my wrist."
2.0,Tight around the calf.
2.0,I chose the worng style of dress. It arrived and I tried it on and reaembeled a giant shapless baggy potato sack. I was 7 months pregnant and a size small didn't even cling to my belly it was so baggy. Was returned.
2.0,"Two stars because of the size & how nice it looks on my pandora bracelet, however, this charm was disappointing. Looks like a cheap sticker was placed in the heart, not what I  wanted."
2.0,"The pendant is cute, but cheap.  The pearl was awful!  lines all over it, misshaped , wasn't impressed"
2.0,"I had purchased one size smaller, I'm afraid. But due to XL being unavailable, I'll have to make do. It is a hassle to return if I have to pay shipping fee. The material is very 'hard'. It is not easy to stretch or maneuver."
2.0,I love the design but the clasp broke as soon as I first opened it . and if that wasn't bad it turned 2 days after wearing it .
2.0,"bought these several times... last few sets I got have manufacturing defects. when you whip the lenses off, they just pop right out EASILY. I have to be EXTRA careful to barely touch the lenses with EXTREMELY light pressure or they pop out"
2.0,Ordered 00 but they are too big and I cannot wear them. Not true to size.
2.0,Fabric is cheap looks like I’m wearing a bag for bottoms crop top way too short like right under your TATAS! Lol
2.0,Amazing idea but executed very poorly! Pieces of the anklet broke as I took it out of the bag
2.0,"These were super cute and I was very excited to wear them. Out of the 5, I have one pair left and that is probably only because I haven't worn them. The first pair didn't even last 2 hours. The second pair lasted the day, but not the washing machine. The third pair tore as I was putting them on. The fourth pair made it through a few hours of wear, washing, and then the toes got a hole within 15 minutes of me wearing them the second time. Maybe if younger girls (not yet in women's shoes) wore them, they might work better but I would imagine them being quite baggy. Save your money and buy a different set."
2.0,I bought 2 sets of these.<br />They wear holes in the heals within a month.<br />Don't buy.
2.0,"I was bummed it didn't really fit that well at all.. it was too short. The upper part (chest, arms, back) was a bit too narrow. Now all was lost though it's made for a decent night gown for my kid.."
2.0,The ruched bust wasn't very attractive. The fit wasn't the same as other dresses I've bought from this brand. It felt tight and restrictive. Overall I did not like the fit of the dress and sent it back.
2.0,"Very cute earrings, but the backing broke off before my daughter could wear them."
2.0,Thought it would be longer. Very well made.
2.0,"Great price, and they kept wind and snow out of your eyes, but.... They are not comfortable, the padding was thin, so you felt plastic hitting your face, they fog up often, and they made you want to ruin our and buy something else for a little more..."
2.0,I really wanted to love this! The style is exactly what I’m looking for! Very cute but it is SO flimsy and it doesn’t fit the way it should and there isn’t a smaller size.
2.0,"I bought this for my 3 year old for Halloween.  He is tall and slim.  The pants on this costume are made tiny!  It would t go past his thighs.  He was so disappointed that we were going to have to return it.  The top and everything else fit great.  These pants might have fit a 2 year old, but would have been uncomfortable.  I cannot believe it was for a child 4-8 year old."
2.0,Took a chance on buying this ring because it has no reviews and was prime. It came broken and I was suups disappointed ... giving 2 starts because I was being cheap and I took the risk on this ring listed at $6 instead of other listings with reviews that are $12-$13. Oh well I returned. Lol
2.0,I don’t know how this has so many good stars. Mine looks nothing like the picture mine looks like a cheap Barbie size sweater.
2.0,"They fit right, and they arrived quickly - but the padding is SO MUCH.  It feels very bulky when wearing them.  These would be good for long-distance cycling and tours, but not for the casual bicycle rider.  They were a bit too thin in other areas and very padded and bulky in the groin.  So if you are looking for a ton of padding for your bicycle ride, these would be good, but not the best."
2.0,"The picture fabric looks more like a cotton, but once arrived, felt like a polyester. Didn't like the material at all. Seems to run true to size. I ordered a size up, but should have ordered my true size. Had to return!"
2.0,2 stars for quality. It's a cheap pair of sunglasses so fit and finish isn't exactly high. 3 stars off for fit. These have big lenses which isn't horrible but they sit high and have massive gaps underneath that light comes up through. It's actually enough to be extremely distracting. I thought maybe my smallish face could be the reason but when my wife tried them on her reaction was the same. You can literally just glance down and see under the lenses a few feet in front of you.
2.0,I love t my Telic flip-flops that I wear. But they seem to be a bit pricey. So I have been looking for something comparable. These are not it. They are substantially wider. I wear a size 10 women’s in Telek and that’s what I order. I ordered a 10 woman’s in this brand and that’s the difference. If I were to try them again I’d order a size or two smaller
2.0,"This dress is as thin and light as a slip and feels like one, too. From the fit on the model, I expected this dress to be a bit loose in the waist and body skimming on the chest and hips. In reality, the dress billows out at the waist and is skin tight in the chest and hips. The neck hole and arm holes are also tight and uncomfortable and the placing of the cutouts precludes wearing a bra underneath. Overall, this is not a good look. There is a tag on the inside with the brand name, but no care instructions. I am giving this two stars only because the color is gorgeous, and it might fit better on someone with a very thin body type. For me, however, it is unwearable."
2.0,"Necklace arrived broken, and seemed very cheap.  I was however able to send it back for a refund.  Product not great, but saler was great to work with."
2.0,"The description says 100% cotton and lace however the material is not cotton it is like some sort of crepe paper material, and it doesn't feel good to the skin I might add.  The lace portion of the dress is beautiful which a shame this would have been a lovely piece"
2.0,The red polarized lenses are thinner material which causes a substantial gap between the lens and the frame. The thin lens allows them to wiggle since the screws can't be tightened enough to take the gap out. The coating looked good but don't the durability of it.
2.0,These are more like nylon/polyester with no compression.  Just like wearing a tank top.  The do not suck you in at all.
2.0,Does not look well made. Some of the stitches seem to be coming loose.
2.0,ordered 2 pairs for my twins - after 1 day at the water park the seams started to come apart on the one pair. Disappointing.
2.0,No me gustó como me quedó. Soy talla M y me quedo muy ancha y corta a la vez. La regale.
2.0,Long wait for delivery you can track it small size fits person and zero size I don’t think people that have 0 size needs those Leggings
2.0,Poor fitting … water leaks in to eye during swim
2.0,Material is not well made. Length of sleeves are too short. Sewing on it can be seen.
2.0,It’s itchy but cute dress however it doesn’t stay on the shoulders when you start to move. Definitely returning this item for a refund.
2.0,"The color was a bit darker than I expected and the cups were a lot flatter.  The wrinkles were created after a few unsuccessful attempts to fit the cup around myself, but it doesn't appear to accommodate curves. (I typically wear a 32 DD or 34 D.)  The color showed under my lighter color tops and I was unable to get a smooth silhouette even under loose fitting tops.<br /><br />The adhesive was great and still sticky through multiple positioning attempts.<br /><br />With similar products, hooking the clips helped to reduce jiggle but didn't alter my shape much. With this product, hooking the clips gave me a kind of uni-boob effect.<br /><br />This is not the one for me."
2.0,"Not good quality at all, there are loose strings and the edges aren't finished properly."
2.0,The shorts are fine the shorts are short and super soft I didn’t get a headband. I did get a little cotton tail to pin on the shorts if I want. HOWEVER the top is wayyyy too small I got a size large if you have double ds and up this top is most definitely not for you.
2.0,I like this shirt but it's way too small. I'm not overweight or big boned. I ordered a large because of the other comments and it fits like a small. Keeping it because I washed it already but wouldn't leave the house in it.
2.0,"I ordered two pair in different colors. One pair fit, the other is several sizes to big."
2.0,TOO SMALL  Gave it away
2.0,very cute but very quickly became oxidized and turned brown
2.0,The yellow is more orange than yellow. It isn’t form fitting like the picture. There is no tag or even washing instructions. I’d send it back but it’s fine for wearing around the house. Not for date night like I had hoped.
2.0,"Not great grip, slips right out of my hair."
2.0,"A week after I had the band, the color started rubbing off the edges. It doesn't stay clasped well either. It is pretty but not great quality."
2.0,"The earrings are nice and they shipped out fairly quick. With that being said, they are not the same as the pair in the picture. The ones shown above are all black (which is why I bought them, I thought they looked awesome) but when I opened them up they're silver and black. It was kind of disappointing but they were cheap so I can't complain to much!"
2.0,"THE BUTTONS ARE  VERY POOR QUALITY. IT IS A BIT SMALLER IN SIZE,"
2.0,"My mom sent these as a gift for my son. Very cute, fits perfect, but one of the bottoms tore a large hole at the seem after the first wash so one pair is useless now. Very disappointing."
2.0,"These were so tight I couldn't get them on my feet, had to return."
2.0,Mine are a year old but I mainly wore them around my pool last summer. Got them out last week and wore for first time in months and toe strap busted.  I have had several Hoka shoes so I’m extremely disappointed with the quality of these.  Looking at reviews it appears this is a common problem with them.
2.0,Sadly the flap is already breaking and the colors are rubbing off.
2.0,Product presents a bit more silver than the pic details.  I was expecting more of a light metallic finish.
2.0,Fit was small and garment was cheaply made - it has been returned
2.0,We ordered the red.  It was very orange and thin cheap material.  Not formal wear as you’d believe it was
2.0,"I'm sure there are people who love this shirt. Personally, it fits weird on me and I really don't like the material. It feels like it should be a bathing suit. It isn't form fitting or the least bit flattering. It fits like I'm wearing a potato sack, and the arm &#34;holes&#34; are saggy in my armpits, but if I were to size down, I'm afraid it would be too tight. Also, the neck feels like it is choking me. All in all, it's just an odd fit."
2.0,Took forever to get product! And they are thin. Will not buy again.
2.0,I liked it but it broke the first week I wore it
2.0,"It's an ok suit, but the color has faded like I've had it for years and I've only had it a few weeks."
2.0,Perfect for the sun.
2.0,Stones were small some broken and not the stones in the picture.
2.0,I’m 5’4 so I assumed a small would work for me however it goes to mid shin. This wouldn’t have been too big an issue except it’s hard to work let alone get anything accomplished in this. Also the dress fit okay over my hips and shoulders but was obnoxiously loose at my stomach and chest. A complete waste of money
2.0,The tank tops are nice and long. I like the fabric. It is thin but I do like it. The part that ruined it for me is that the straps are to far over so the straps constantly fall off my shoulder. I had to cut the straps and re-sew them so they don’t fall down.
2.0,"One of the sets I received came broken and apart. I would have thought they checked the items before they mailed them out as they all were in separate bags within one bag. I only have 2 starts as it was only 1 broken set, which happened to be the size I actually needed."
2.0,"I really thought this dress would be perfect, but it's just too big.  Usually I'm a large to extra large, but this dress fits like a double XL.  The material is also cheap feeling, and there were threads popping out everywhere.  Really really disappointed."
2.0,I like the style but way to small
2.0,"Breaking this review into 2 parts, one for the single triggers, one for the double triggers.<br /><br />Double Triggers<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />In terms of trigger position, it is a good design and it doesn't take long to get use to the finger position for both triggers.  That said, the triggers are about as barebones as it gets.  No springs or mechanical parts aside from one piece of plastic/metal resting on another piece of plastic/metal.  Obviously, this leads to imprecise trigger presses, and makes the clicker part slow to return to a ""non-clicked"" position.  Which is a disaster for shooter games when you need rapid clicks.<br /><br />Single Triggers<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />These triggers are actually not bad, they have good spring and are snappy.  They stay reasonable snug and fit over my phone case.  This issue which these ones is that both broke the very same way after only 2 or so weeks.  The plastic that holds the trigger against the back of your phone is too weak, and gets worse the more you use them.  Eventually it will just snap.<br /><br />Conclusion.. While I was able to get some decent play out of the single triggers, this 4-pack leaves much too much to be desired, and there are better options."
2.0,"I wasn't expecting too much for the price, but this watch is pretty lame.  The map picture isn't very detailed.  The band has a cheap vinyl feel to it and the metal clasp pieces don't seem rugged. The good: The plane travels around each minute; my kids thought that was cool.  It did come with a battery."
2.0,They are dyed grey pearls. Was hoping for natural grey.
2.0,Sizes are not comparable to those in the US. There is no way the size I ordered was indeed large.
2.0,"It was cute, but way too short. I wasn’t even comfortable attempting to sit down while trying it on. Not a very flattering cut - and certainly not as loose as the picture suggests. Sadly, I will be returning it."
2.0,The rubber started to peel after a few wears
2.0,They were bent when they arrived--very badly packaged.  Fortunately they didn't break when I bent the studs back.  But they were cheap.
2.0,too binding
2.0,"I got 2 left gloves, gloves look good otherwise."
2.0,"They are pretty, I washed several times, as they had a chemical smell. After several  washing, the first time I wore them, my face turned red, looked like red sunburn. Have not wore since."
2.0,Not the color I thought it would be. Doesn’t fit my iTouch watch
2.0,"Shipping was fast, but the item looks very cheap, I’ll give to my daughter and buy something else."
2.0,If you touch the screen of the watch at all the time changes
2.0,"These are a bit baggy, and they are also too thin. I can see my underwear through them! The pattern is great, good colors.<br />Also, it's more of a slick shiny fabrick, not a nice cotton legging like I was thinking. :("
2.0,The color is beautiful but not the material
2.0,Uncomfortable. Advertised for men/women but better for teens.
2.0,all the leather chipped from black to brown... I liked it but now it looks so old and used.
2.0,"I’ll be returning this skirt. I did not see any details posted on what kind or material this skirt would be. The picture makes it appear to be a polyester linen blend, but this skirt is some kind of stretchy Lycra material. That is not what I wanted so I will be returning. When you put the skirt on, the pleats do not hold their form. Not what I expected."
2.0,The pumpkins were upside down instead of as shown in the photos.  The dress printed pattern was way off.  Would not recommend it.
2.0,"I bought a 3X and it compares to a medium size. Cute design, nice fabric, but runs small"
2.0,"This is a very cute style, and feels really soft and cozy.  It does run quite small, and anyone who is busty or has a big tummy or butt is probably going to be disappointed."
2.0,"It's a super cute dress, but the fabric does NOT stretch. I got a large, but it wouldn't fit over my chest (36D)."
2.0,"The band continually came unhooked from the watch. I almost lost my watch twice, and finally said ""screw it"" and went back to the one that came with the watch."
2.0,"Super cute print, but fit is smaller than described.  Fabric feels a little cheap, but comfy"
2.0,Hard to get around the waist.
2.0,"My son's watch worked well for a week but one of the leather straps quickly broke off, making it unwearable."
2.0,"It was just a 3 point cover and could hardly see the eagle,globe and anchor"
2.0,"This is mis advertised as a sweatshirt. It is a thick long sleeve T shirt. It is not sweatshirt material. others had said it runs small and so i got a Medium though i normally order smalls of oversized shirts.  To make it look like the picture on Amazon, i would have to order a large. The zippers are higher up on my shoulders and the neck is a smaller opening on me with the medium size. I am 5'6 and 130 lbs. This is likely one of those shirts manufactured in China to resemble the original sweatshirt, but they didn't quite do it--probably to make it cheap"
2.0,Super cheap buttons. One of them broke just after removing it form the packaging. The only reason this got 2 stars instead of 1 is because it actually is very warm and soft.
2.0,"Stiff, uncomfortable, no arch support. Returned them because it would have taken way too long to break them in, so my feet would have suffered. Nice looking, but not nice to my feet."
2.0,"Runner material than I expected. Also, runs one size larger."
2.0,I had to re order this because the advertised 12-14 does not fit like it. I’m a size 12 in jeans (14 comfortable) and the bathing suit fit right. It seems like it would be for someone a bit taller (I’m 5’2). I took the padding’s out and the red is a bit transparent so keep them on. Order up if you’re on the heavier side like me
2.0,"While they seem to be well made, there is no evidence that they improve night vision, and by absorbing some blue lights they actually subtract from the amount of light reaching your eye. Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,My poor poor man friend. I got him this to be Rocky for Rocky Horror so he would stop using my gold shorts.... instead he stole my gold shorts and told me I can have these.... These are super small and squeeze in all the wrong places.
2.0,"Fit is small.  Usually an L is an comfortable relaxed fit.  This is almost a size M even though it's labeled as a size L.  Pockets are very shallow, so not that great if you are trying to hold a phone or wallet.  Velcro side adjustments do make these easy to adjust (down) in waist size, which I did use to get a snug fit around the waist.  In other words, waist size is ok, but the legs are too tight.  Ordering a size up may not work, as the waist portion becomes too big."
2.0,It was okay but not what I wanted so I returned it.
2.0,Didn't care for the fabric at all. Very staticy. I could have worn a small but had ordered a medium so it was a little big (5'4&#34; 125lbs). Would have been super cute if the dress was a cotton based material
2.0,Are usually wear a large and this was a little too tight in the bust and I’m not a big busted at all. Had to return
2.0,color was great but the neckline was so large.  Falling off my shoulders
2.0,"Update (original review below): Unfortunately, no surprises here and it's a classic case of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. I've used the belt for about 2 weeks and then left it in the pants on the shelf to only pick it up some time later. The belt showed serious sign of wear and I did loose (found it after some searching) the guide loop, which fell off after I took the belt out.<br /><br />My recommendation is to stay away from this one. It won't last.<br /><br />Original review<br />It's an ok belt, especially for the price. It looks better on the picture and the box it came with was rather impressive. The hole puncher was also a convenient tool as it turned out to be too long. Instructions on cutting it were rather clear, so it didn't take long, however, i'm not confident in the screw that is holding the buckle together.<br /><br />The belt is also thinner than some other brand name belts I've had and it had an unexplainable &#34;cheap feel&#34; to it. Though it looks very decent and soft.<br /><br />I was also not impressed with the belt guide, which, as others mentioned, is not attached and can be easily lost."
2.0,The blue ones were NOT fog proof & left lens has started leaking after 2 weeks of swimming. The black pair - left lens will fog up.
2.0,Fit was too small. I even upsized my size based on other reviews and it was still too small.
2.0,I liked it but not everything fits everyone
2.0,Snap broke the first week of my using it.
2.0,"Cheap fabric. Very light, poor quality. The dress Not as long as the picture. Will not purchase this brand again. This is dress you lounge around in the house.  ND🙁"
2.0,"Hat was very thin, even thinner than a tshirt, definitely not meant to keep you warm. It also had no real stretch to it to help it stay in place on your head. The material is somewhat slippery and without any stretch to keep it in place, it literally slid all around on my head... someone hugged me and it literally slid off my head when i leaned my head back slightly  - very embarrassing.<br />WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN."
2.0,"The style is cute and the fabric is nice. However, it is too small. I'm 5'9&#34; and wear between a 10 and a 12 and the Extra Large was too small. Also, it is way longer than pictured. It is more above the knee than tunic length. The pins do not stand up either. I returned both the large and extra large."
2.0,The top is adorable and fits really well. But the bottoms were completely see through! There's no way I'd wear those in public especially in the water.
2.0,"I don't think I am a person that puts wear and tear on a watch band, but this one has not held up as much as I would have liked. It is starting to turn black/silver. The worst part of this band is it snags on everything! I would look at others before buying this one"
2.0,"I wanted to love it. The colors are great and it's really cute, but it didn't fit too well. It was very large around the stomach and the fabric was stiff. It sits in my closet un-used day after day. I keep it in case I have nothing else to wear."
2.0,"I loved the style of this shirt, but the fit was off. It fit in some places but not in others. It was just not comfortable."
2.0,"Unfortunately the metal broke around about a week after getting it. I bought it for my mom, she loved the design but it broke. I wouldn’t recommend it, even for the price."
2.0,no robe rope. that an essential part which makes it hard to use. disappointing after waiting along time for it to arrive.
2.0,I was very happy with my purchase. Put first pair on my sneakers. By the time I got home. 3 of the ties had broken. They are not durable at all
2.0,"I ordered the two pack with the black and the pink glasses, but I only got the black ones. I wanted two pairs so I could leave one at my office and keep one at home. I like the glasses, but I am disappointed I only got 1 pair."
2.0,The inseam split after wearing these twice...  didn't even wear them for a full day.
2.0,"These are supposed to be pink.  They are more of a gray-lavender color.  Also, the stiching is wrong.  I am returning these because I need pink."
2.0,The glitter part of the band that touches the bottom of your wrist irritated me and rubbed my skin red & raw. I wore it the 3 weeks before Christmas and a lot of the glitter had worn off in several places so I won’t be able to use it again for other holidays. I don’t think it’s worth the price for 3 weeks worth it wear...and I’m not a complainer in normal life!
2.0,The item fits more like a blouse than a coverall
2.0,Not a practical beach outfit...
2.0,"I just wanted some simple cotton camisoles that I could throw on under sweaters and T-shirts and sweatshirts and even under loungewear. It was a great price. The material was great. The little lace accents were nice. At this price I didn’t expect them to last a long time, but I should’ve known. They fall apart as soon as you wash them. The lace is already separated from the actual camisole. So if you’re looking for something in expensive and to wear under things, they’re fine. But don’t think you’re gonna wear them out of the house after you wash them.  Not likely."
2.0,This is NOT a wrap dress as shown. The dress is completely sewn together. The tie is a seperate piece. They also did not include small loops on the side of the dress (since this is not a true wrap dress) so the tie actually falls down your waist as you walk as it cannot stay in the position you would like it to to look like a real wrap around.
2.0,Fits a little too small. Also is thin and the material is cheap. I washed it once and it looks like it isn’t going to hold well.
2.0,This looks like a parachute
2.0,Ordered my size according to the provided size chart and it is too small. I will be returning for a bigger size.
2.0,I don't understand why this shirts is made of a different fabric and is a different size from another color.
2.0,"I did not care for material, loved the color. And wasn’t made very well."
2.0,The side pocket zipper does not work properly. But all in all they are comfortable.
2.0,"Speidel older bands used to be 3/4"" wide. Seems the newer bands are 5/8"" wide and too narrow for larger watches. Looks out of proportion and strange.  Band width isn't listed in the product info for some reason. Been using Speidel for years great product and not cheap. Too bad they decided to make the bands narrower especially with all the larger sports/step tracker watches on the market.  Returned."
2.0,Wayyyyyy too small. Not even close to the normal size chart. Will be returning. Decent quality though.
2.0,Muy frágil
2.0,"We purchased a size ""youth small, 8"".<br />I am a 5'2"", 128 pound adult and I was able to put these on.<br />The 4.5 foot tall, 65 pound small child I actually bought these for has enough room in them for 2 small children."
2.0,"I probably won't wear these socks again and wish they could be returned. They are very attractive but are not warm. The material is somewhat harsh and frequently reminds you its there. Since I only wear knee highs in the colder winter months, this is important. They seem like summer socks (uncomfortable ones) with a winter styling."
2.0,"Looked cute for my son's John Lennon costume for Halloween, but they broke the first day.  He wasn't being rough with them.  Just not very sturdy."
2.0,Turned my neck green after 1 week...tarnished quickly.
2.0,"Very cute!<br />However, when the package came in (late) the bows were bent up, and are permanently bent this way.<br />Basically there is a crease going through 3 of the 5 chicks.  They are basically a single layer of felt with the eyes and wings attached and it is all sitting on an alligator clip.<br />As artistically challenged as I am, I think I could make these =(<br /><br />Sad face."
2.0,Just did not like the look of these glasses on me.
2.0,"I was made out of sturdy and nice material but the over all style is very cartoon like, I was not expecting it to be so dramatic."
2.0,"Hard to remove the protective covering, but that was relatively minor.  My biggest complaint is that it warped in the shipping box, and now I can't seem to get it back to form.  Its useable, but not very comfortable, and pretty dang warped.  It looks wonky as all getup when I put it on.  Good thing I bought this more as a gag anyway, but definitely a waste of money considering the condition its in."
2.0,It's a cute top. I haven't worn it yet. It arrived with so much perfume smell on it that so far I've had to wash it twice. I don't understand why there's perfume smell on clothes I've ordered from Amazon. I'm puzzled and a little annoyed since I'm allergic to fragrance.
2.0,Fishy smell. The arm straps aren’t adjustable and too large. Should sell for 5 bucks or less.
2.0,"The length was fine but they fit like spandex, not meant for my nerd body"
2.0,The first time I wore it I was  feeling cute then my sequence fell off. I had a blank spot on my back. Not a proud moment.
2.0,Looks like a cut my sheets and decided to sew some pants.
2.0,Gloves RIP very easy. Wore them for a two days and noticed they had a big RIP in them. Will stick to my leather insulated gloves instead.
2.0,There is no strings attached or at all
2.0,"I consider this more of a very pretty pearl and straw visor, definitely not a hat. The brim is very wide and offers a lot of protection from the sun. Unfortunately, the visor is constantly moving...does not stay in place, regardless of my hairstyle."
2.0,I’m a size 7 in shoes and the heels of the sock would go all the way up to my ankles. Didn’t like them
2.0,I don't recommend this dress because of the shoulders straps too long and there's no way to adjust it. The upper back of the dress is too low that its impossible to cover the back closure of bra.
2.0,Runs small . . . not quite what I expectef!
2.0,Not functioning properly
2.0,Bag is nice for the price but a lot smaller than I expected.  Will have to send it back for something a little bigger to fit a laptop in.
2.0,I kinda felt like the material was a lot cheaper in person then the picture portrayed. I am 5’8 and 175 pounds and it was too short on my arms and when I lifted my arms it made the dress itself too short. I’d say the other issue was the neck line- the button on the top made the color super tight on my neck and I hate that! So I’m mainly leaving this comment for the curvier chicks! If you are slimmer and arms aren’t super long it will probably fit you much better!
2.0,"Got these 5/17. Thought they were great and ordered a second pair in black, then they ripped today 6/20. Stitching came right out of the toe area, and they weren't too tight or anything to cause stress on that area. Just over a month? Sad. Hopefully these black ones don't do the same thing."
2.0,I returned because of the poor quality. The color also appeared faded.
2.0,It's a fancy hoodie ..not a coat.
2.0,These boots seemed to be okay quality until today when my daughter wore them for the third time. One of the handles fell off! I guess I got what I paid for.
2.0,"So when I purchased I didn’t know the butterfly would be so bulky, i then struggled to unscrew it from given package. Once in my ear, I slept in it, and i woke up without it in my ear."
2.0,Nice but waaaaayyy too small. Size should say xs/s Definitely not a one size fit all. I wear a medium shirt and this was way to snug
2.0,"Yes, they are super inexpensive, so you wouldn't expect too much. But still, they look really cheapy and break easily."
2.0,Too thick and bulky. Too pricey for the quality.
2.0,It’s pretty but it breaks easily
2.0,It is very pretty.  However the color is barely blue.<br />Stones look practically clear.
2.0,In the photos the stone has a really nice sheen ... not so it’s really very dull looking
2.0,"Great shirt but the colors are not as pictured here. The mesh is white, not grey like in the pictures."
2.0,"This jacket is soft and warm but thin at the same time. There is too much fabric by the zipper so every zip up and down, the fabric gets caught in the zipper and if you’re not careful, it will rip. The sleeves were too long but the waist trim was short and I bought a XL but should have ordered a Large. It is a cute jacket but not for every day wear which is what I was looking for."
2.0,Runs a little big and was a bit complicated to put on because it requires you to tie both sides.<br />My husband didn’t realize they were crotchless until I mentioned it.
2.0,"Initially I'd have given it 5 stars... got it for DH for Xmas, tho he didn't actually start wearing it til Feb. He loved it! Then this morning he threw it on the bed, saying it was broken. As you can see in the photos, one of the pins holding the buckle fell out after only a few months of occasional use. Too bad, as it truly was a great idea.<br /><br />Update: found a fix...2 small machine screws and some black paint."
2.0,"Im a size 10 and I ordered a large. The fit was quite odd as the arms were tight and torso was short. The ears and eyes were falling apart and the sweater sheds leaving you with a coating of white lint and fuzz balls. I wore it anyway because I wanted to match with my daughter but this is definitely sized to fit Asians with a smaller build and torso. Order a size or 2 up. But if you can, order a completely different sweater."
2.0,Again this gorgeous in the picture I wore the necklace once and the necklace turned tarnished . I mean it was very very in expensive but They could've made a better necklace it's the ones ones where in twice kind a piece of jewelry
2.0,Purchased for a little more coverage than regular brief underwear but these are too short and have less coverage than regular underwear
2.0,"This product is advertised as “padded” but the entire bra was extremely thin and there was no padding. This bra offers no support, but good coverage.<br />Quality was somewhat cheap and the bra was not comfortable to wear."
2.0,"Makes my feet sweat BAD, and they typically don't. Also, every time I take a step it suctions to the bottom of my feet and makes the most embarrassing ""farting"" noise lol. I wish I could love them, they're super cute other than some rhinestones falling off after wearing a few times around the house."
2.0,This ring is so light in weight it looks and feels like cheap costume jewelry.
2.0,"If you're into large frames, these might be the glasses for you. I looked ridiculous in them and didn't feel that the description made them out to be extremely oversized."
2.0,"The belt I received does not go up to 52"" like stated."
2.0,Item arrived broken. Cheap but interesting.
2.0,"Cheap fabric and awkward pattern, or maybe it’s not the pattern and the workmanship was just poor. Would not recommend or buy again. My daughter couldn’t wear it."
2.0,Color is awful
2.0,"I got a 3x per the measurements and The skirt fit perfectly! The top was way off however. I couldn’t even get it on. For more like a large, while the skirt was a true 2x/3x"
2.0,"I had really high expectations for these, and sadly am very disappointed. They give me MAJOR camel toe from the moment I put them on, and the ""compression"" is really only the top 5 inches, leaving my lower stomach sticking out (not flattering at all). Also the fabric is loose the around my lower calf for some reason. I could see these being nice if you're super toned, but it's a no from me."
2.0,"Immediately sent back when I received this bag.  No way this is a 50L bag. I held up my Osprey 32L bag next to this one and it was clearly bigger with much better construction and way more compartments. I suppose this bag could work fine for day trips, and the price is fantastic, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I like it BUT it has one big flaw - cleaning them with liquid ruined it - the liquid seeps into the multifaceted design and stays suspended in it - there is no way to clear it even trying to blow on it.  In fact, i'm waiting even now to see if they will dry up and even then what kind of residue will be left behind.  Also, they are very easy to scratch.<br />SO.  since i like the product, i went ahead and bought one more pair but being on a fixed income i will have to pamper the next set.  But after that, i'll be 40 bucks into it and that's already just under half of a script - which i would get if i wasnt disabled... this method fits a need but only till cost effectiveness is exceeded"
2.0,"These are nice and soft, and comfortable. However, I regret not returning them because I never ever reach for them.  The reason is that there’s SO MUCH excess material in the front pelvis/crotch region. It isn’t flattering at all and creates a fun “camel-y” vibe if pulled up too far (or even not pulled up very far). I would definitely never wear these outside my house. The two photos I’m including are showing mid-rise (the least camel-y way to wear them) and pulled up to my waist, where I LIKE to wear my joggers."
2.0,Very very small and the elastic is extremely tight. Only good for someone with nearly a man's haircut!
2.0,"The leather is stretchy and looks more velvete/suede like than I expected.  I think because it's stretches, it's less comfortable.  The overall band length is at an awkward length for me, too short to fold back under well but long enough to need to be folded back under.  The metal ring on the under strap is too big and doesn't sit flat to the leather band.  I'm really rather disappointed with the product."
2.0,"The glasses are dark which is nice, but the material it's made of is unattractive and feels too toy-like"
2.0,I didn't even have them in a day and they fell out without me even touching them
2.0,The zipper keeps coming off. I can fix it but its annoying
2.0,Completely see though!! Sheer streatchy fabric is cheep and needs an under shirt.
2.0,"They’re very fragile and bits fall off way more than they should, which is never. But what do you expect for $7?"
2.0,This Tamina- Amulet W/ Sands of time isn't what you think its much more for kids then that are 8 or lower. I though it was actually an amulet with sand and stuff but no it wasn't. The silver sand you see is pretty much painted on there and not inside and its plastic
2.0,Doesn't work with a deviated septum but still good quality my friend loves it
2.0,"Bought this for my baby shower and I ended up returning, I didn't gain a whole lot while pregnant, I'm 5ft tall and weighed 115 prepregancy and 135 at the end and this dress made me feel huge! And not in a good pregnant way. Very unflattering and was a very thin material, showed every crease and was see through."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Very thin and generic. Too price for what it is.
2.0,The fit was too small and the color was not as shown.  I sent it back.
2.0,The fabric was much different from what I imagined it to be.
2.0,"I expected a cheap dress and that is what I got, I saw that all the comments of the sizing being to small and so I measured my waist and ordered an Xl although I am a medium regularly. Got it in the mail, was see through, too big, and it does not have ruffles in the back like the picture has. Very dissapointed."
2.0,"I returned this swimsuit for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I ordered a large but received a medium. It fit but the proportions on the bottoms are really strange. See below.<br /><br />2. Fit. First off, if you do order this, size down at least one size or more. I typically wear a medium top and large bottoms. I received a medium and both fit except for the odd proportions on the bottoms. They are cut much higher in the front than the back, almost like a thong but not. It's very strange.<br /><br />3. Poor quality. The material feels like it will not hold up to even very few washes. The elastic in the bands also feels very cheap and perhaps old, the way old elastic starts to crumble and stretch on really old, worn clothing.<br /><br />4. There are cup inserts on the top, but they are a really small size and wouldn't offer coverage for women with even small breasts. That said, they move around inside the cup pockets, and there's no hole to remove them."
2.0,Material not as good as I thought.
2.0,"Material looks cheap. Arms are baggy, just not impressed."
2.0,"Its a nice fabric, color is the same as pictured, not see through and a nice length. I got a size small for my girlfriend. She says there isn't much give and the waist area is rather tight. The ruffles are frumpy and mske it look a little odd"
2.0,It was really small more of a kid size rather than Adult.
2.0,"Not happy with the fit... it's too baggy and doesn't fit like the other shirts I order of this brand. I've always ordered a M in this shirt and it fits perfect. This one is a size or two too big. The material is the same, which is nice. Add the price of the shirt to the cost to get the shirt tailored, it's not worth it. 2-stars!"
2.0,Odd flip up design. Bulky hard to clip on.
2.0,These flip flops have a cute design and all however they run small. I ordered a size 9 but they were too small for me. I feel like they are child size rather than adult.
2.0,Material is nice but size runs small and inside trim keeps sticking out when worn
2.0,"Really small, and the back doesnt seem to fit and stay on snug. One actually fell off my ear cus the back came off."
2.0,Wish I would have brought it a little smaller.
2.0,"I ordered a tan 22mm quick release strap and it arrived extremely fast. It feels soft and genuine and it is quite decent for its price. It's not too thick nor thin, it's great. I have however a complaint about the color. It feels more like cognac brown rather than the orange-brown that is shown on the pics. I'm pretty sure I was sent the tan strap instead of the brown strap because the brown strap is much darker than the one I received. In fashion, tan is the lightest of browns and when I'm thinking of a tan watch strap my mind goes to the tan straps TIMEX provides. Well, this isn't one of them."
2.0,"This thing swallowed my whole face. I feel like it could have covered my ears.<br /><br />Also, it’s made of that silk-like material, not traditional cotton which, for me, is a sensory issue. I ended up returning it."
2.0,The hoops had multiple petals shattered. One of the hook back earrings came missing a hook. Disappointing.
2.0,Its a hat made  by port authority company.  I dont care for it much. Not a fan of their products.  Wish I would of known before purchasing.
2.0,These socks didn't fit. I wear a size 11 shoe and could barely get a pair on. I thought I was going to have to cut them off my feet.
2.0,The metal was very rough and abrasive painful to wear and did not stay closed
2.0,Very cheaply made. I had the original magic wallet that was diplayed on tv. It wore out and I wanted to replace it. This is a very cheap copy. Ended up throwing it out. Do not recomend.
2.0,"Update: the H on one side and the A on the other fell off 3 minutes after carrying it, now it looks as if the quality is pretty crappy if they can't even keep their name on it correctly.<br /><br />Haven't used it yet but I love it, hope it holds up well and appears aesthetically like many other more expensive brands."
2.0,Color doesn't match 😒 almost white pigment
2.0,Very deceiving picture! It is silver when I thought it was white and it did not come with a chain.<br />Not happy!
2.0,Too loose and too high on waist
2.0,"The skirt was nice and long on this, which exactly what I was looking for, but the panty part was so small that even though it fit width-wise, it only covered the bottom half of my butt. Super cute, but so not cut for curvy people."
2.0,Did not like this shirt…poor quality.
2.0,The fabric breaks down after a couple of wears on the ankle part
2.0,Hangs a little off if you have a large bust.
2.0,"This bracelet wasn't right for me, I have small wrists and this bracelet was just too big, it was hard to keep on my wrist.  It was also dirty when it arrived; when it would get wet, or rub on anything like a long sleeve shirt I would have dirt marks all over the sleeves and on my arm, I initially didn't know it was the bracelet until it got wet and it stained some of my sheets (I dropped the wet bracelet on my bed).  Even after trying to wash it, I couldn't get the bracelet to stop making black marks on myself and clothing.  I'm having to return it."
2.0,"I love 4 of the 5 pairs of socks- fit well and are cute! However, we received one sock that is cream and the other matching sock is white!  They are two, VERY different colors!!!"
2.0,"I purchased a black one and a light pink one, both in the same size, 4-6.  They are very cute leotards however, they clearly do not fit the same at all.  The black one is shorter in length and wide across the body.  The pink one is longer in length and slim across the body.  My daughter is tall and slim so naturally the pink one fits better, but the leg openings are rather large so it is a little loose in the butt area.  They are 92% cotton so they may shrink a little,  but seriously think I am going to go ahead and just return these. 👎"
2.0,Not a very attractive pant or fit.
2.0,This feels like it weighs 25 pounds.
2.0,Glasses worked alright but cheaply and poorly made. The lens clips snapped off the frame while the glasses were in the storage case.
2.0,Guess I missed reading the small print or should have read the reviews closer....these did not work for my garage door...wrong color code ...so now I have useless openers because you can’t return. Got the right one at Lowes.
2.0,"Haven't worn it yet, product is different  than the picture."
2.0,Ok shirt
2.0,The denim is to thick so it doesn't sit nicely
2.0,"Ordered 2 pair, “A” pair were fine, “M” pair was printed upside down on one of the earrings. Shipping was delayed by a day so did not have time to return before I needed to give them to the recipient. Luckily the recipient has a good sense of humor and said she would just wear that one upside down."
2.0,Upon opening the box the watch truly sparkled! I was joyous to add this band to my collection. But when I tried to put it on I had the hardest time. It was so hard to bend it took me several minutes out of my busy morning to put it on. It was such a struggle. It is uncomfortable to wear. I can only wear it to Special occasions. It is just as equally difficult to remove. I thought this was going to be my favorite piece but it is a glitter fail!
2.0,Doesn't fit around the heel of the foot well. Extra material up around the top of the foot ankle.
2.0,"The price sure was good. I did read the reviews. when I got it, I can tell wasn't going to be comfortable for ME. then wanna tried on, will take  time to put in, I didn't wanna force in, maybe will fit, but sure the hussle I have to go throu each time I wear. most of those shoes has zipper on the side, not this one. not an easy shoe to put on. I don't wanna waste that time. maybe is good for other."
2.0,"I was really excited to receive this pair of gorgeous sandals, but upon a few hours of wearing them, the links broke!  Needless to say, I had to return them - very reluctantly."
2.0,was a girl or child's size
2.0,"I loved the look of this band immediately upon adding it to my watch. However, within just a couple of days, the rose gold color rubbed off and it's just gold now. I was extremely disappointed in how quickly it changed colors. The overall durability and fit of the band is great. If you purchase, just don't expect it to stay pink."
2.0,I thought the earrings were a bit larger compared to the photo.  Not what I expected.
2.0,"This hat is a little small for my large head and the flowers are not lined up correctly with the seam on the top.  If worn with the seam front to back, the flowers sit between the side and back.  It doesn't look right.  If you turn the hat, it doesn't seem to fit right.  It would be a good hat if the decorations were lined up correctly."
2.0,Beautiful product but I was not able to wear them the part that goes into the earring hole was too thick.
2.0,"I give them 2 stars because they're warm and comfy, but I wouldn't wear them outside the house.  I don't think these were Seconds, I think they may have been Thirds.  One leg was shorter than the other.  The pattern didn't match up on the legs.  One leg was twisted.  I wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,The quality of the shoes is not the best and the shape is weird. These shoes are kind of round.
2.0,"I purchased this shirt, and was super excited. I've been looking for a tarrot card t-shirt of the lovers card. I found this and it was beautiful. Then it showed up. The quality of the print was lacking, and the size was off. It ran much smaller than I had anticipated. I ended up returning it. Bummer all around."
2.0,Good idea but these don't stay up at all and my baby had fairly chunky legs so I would think if they would stay up it would be on his legs...
2.0,This watch is really cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.  It worked fine until I got it wet.  It is supposed to be water resistant but once I got it wet the display would fade in and out so I just threw it away.
2.0,These are too flimsy. Doesn't hold the creases too well. You get what you pay for
2.0,At first I really liked this keychain hook. It worked well and the single part construction led me to believe that it would last a long time. It obviously did not. No rough usage either .
2.0,"I give it two stars because, 1) it’s super duper duper cute! 2) the earring was wayyyyyy too short. I couldn’t even screw it on and it went in literally half way through the piercing."
2.0,The quality is not that great. Like tissue paper or a bad halloween costume.
2.0,"Would have been wonderful if i hadnt received such dull boring ones. I also only received 6 instead of the stated 7 for some reason! And one of them was shattered looking on its front size so was completely useless for my needs :( . The other 5 were nice just hardly any flash to them at all but i guess you dont always get lucky. I have ordered from JIC gems in the past and my last order of 5 labradorites were beautiful . So in conclusion there are great batches and very bad batches, i got a bad one this time around. It's a gamble it would seem."
2.0,Was not as pretty in person.
2.0,Shiny and bright. But fall off your ear.
2.0,Looks and feels cheap. Even for the price.
2.0,"Showed up smelling like orange cleaner with a wet stain on it. Box wasn’t damaged, only the shirt inside a plastic bag. Had to have come from the warehouse like that. Have order many products from this seller and I’m very surprised at this issue"
2.0,The glasses frame are 2&#34; and just seem too big. The concept of flip-up glasses is great - wish they made them with smaller lenses.
2.0,Opened the package and the dye smell about knocked me out I've washed multiple times and it still smells rancid
2.0,The person in the photo must be wearing a XXL because it definitely does not fit like that. The material is also much thinner than it appears in the photo. This fits more like a shirt than a tunic. I would say it would be a nice tunic if you are like 5'6 and under. I'll be returning.
2.0,This jacket looked good and appeared to be well made but the XL fit more like a medium/large.  Also my husband complained that the zipper zipped up like in a woman's jacket (the zipper was on the wrong side ...I didn't check to confirm it).  We returned the jacket.
2.0,Pretty dress but not the one I ordered
2.0,They were nice but fell apart fast  during first day of use- pulled it out of its bag and a lens popped out- popped it back in but popped out again later that day-  the lens fell and now that lens is scratched-
2.0,"Love the stretchy material, but the flannel pattern had a slightly defective print that gave it the appearance of a stain."
2.0,"This product is made out of the same material that football and hockey jerseys are made out of.  I do not recommend this material for scarfs or to cover equipment.  In my experience, this is not the type of material that a professional military would use."
2.0,The two items that are supposed to be a pair did not match in color.<br />The hat was so small it didn't even fit my one year old.<br />As separate items I guess they are fine. But the hat won't fit my 3 year  old and I won't be putting an infinity scarf on my one year old.
2.0,"They fit on too tight in the bridge of the nose thus, after a couple of minutes of wear, it feels utterly uncomfortable. The legs are not at the same level when placing it on the table. I was expecting something better."
2.0,"Muy pequeño, no le quedo el producto y no tube asistencia del vendedor"
2.0,It just was not what I expected. Probably will never wear.
2.0,"This turtleneck is quite thin and quite stretchy.  I was somewhat disappointed in it.  It does seem sized right, at least the size large for me, but I'm not impressed with the quality.  It really works only if you layer it under something else.  I found it odd that there was NO label inside.  Nothing to indicate size, fabric content, country of origin, or care instructions.  The best thing about it is it's soft and feels good on my skin.  But there was a sewing flaw near the neckline.<br /><br />The turtleneck is quite long, so has to be folded quite a bit for me, whom no one has ever described as swan-like.  That's okay, but aside from the softness, I just wasn't impressed with this top."
2.0,Product doesn't clean as well as expected for the price.<br />they are depending on the Norwex reputation to sell the product.
2.0,Looks cheap and color is off
2.0,Cheap and I am sure a knockoff
2.0,"I purchased this in 3-6 month and it was HUGE. It came more like a 9-12 month. I’m so bummed because the pants and bow was so adorable and silky and even great quality, but since it was too big it’s a waste now."
2.0,Delivered on time in a lovely bubble wrapped envelope then in a ziploc bag and finally in a cute black pouch. I pulled out the earrings and one of them was completely bent in half. I straightened it out but can’t imagine it will last long. I guess you get what you pay for :(
2.0,"I bought these for use as a party favor in an Oscars party schwag bag. When they arrived, there was one whose switch had been on for who knows how long. Out of the bag of 40, at least 12 didn't work at all, and another 6 or so, I'll be working to see if I can get the contact bent a bit, because they sputtered on long enough for me to tell that there was life in the battery.<br /><br />Otherwise, I like them well enough. They're certainly a cheaper version of some others I've bought. These have thin rubber straps, not elastic like my other ones. But the lights (when they work) are plenty bright."
2.0,"You can just tell it's poorly made when the fabric on the sleeves doesn't match (one sleeve plain white, one has fabric with pattern going opposite direction). While I love the pockets, you can see them through the sheerness of the fabric. And the dress ""sticks"" to everything: panties, legs.  Overall, I wish I just would have returned it instead of wearing it once and then tossing it in a donation bin."
2.0,I ordered up a size and it was too tight on my chest to where I could barely even button it. The waist was tight but I would have been able to deal with that if it fit my chest area and I ordered an XXL and my bust is a 38 C. I had to return as soon as i tried it on.
2.0,doesn't help block sunglare

2.0,The top fit fine but super cheap and poorly made the bottoms they way they are made sooo cheap and like a thong the suit was not advertised as a flippin thong!
2.0,I broke the minute I picked it up out of the box. really poor quality.
2.0,"These were too long and the waist was too small for my petite frame, I returned these."
2.0,"The lenses look great initially, but they &#34;scratch&#34; very easily. As if the polarized finish buffs off. So they look horrible and tough to see out of. Plus they don't fit in the frames very well."
2.0,Received quickly but is too short.  I am 5'8 and it's above my ankles
2.0,This was BRIGHT pink - neon really. I felt like it was too Barbie's color for me. My 3 year old loved it. The style was frumpy and unflattering. I like the fringe on the edges but that was it. I knew I'd probably never wear it so was returned.
2.0,The shape and size is perfect for kids.  I only deter red and they do not look like picture shown here. They are yellow/ gold.
2.0,"The price of this should have been a quarter of what it was.  It's very cheaply made, not good quality at all."
2.0,Followed the size guide and was still small.
2.0,There sizing is way off. The jeans are so soft wish i could wear them. But had to return. Ordered the size smaller and they are to small. I must just be in between sizes.
2.0,Bought two sets. One was great. The others were so tight I could barely put them on! Ridiculously snug. No way this fits the sizes they claim and I have fairly small feet.
2.0,Does NOT keep your hands warm. Working outside in 30°weather my hands froze.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this belt;  I liked its style, and it seemed well-made.  I just put on my pants the other morning and the buckle pulled off without much effort.<br /><br />I've had a lot of double-sided belts in my life, and this never happened before.  I'll just need to shop for a higher-quality replacement belt.  It may cost twice as much but will last more than 5 times longer.  By the way, I never used this belt roughly...I'm a senior."
2.0,"This was so cute and I was really hoping that it would work. However, as true to size as it may be around, unless you are about 5 feet or under this will probably not fit you. I am only 5'4&#34; and I could barely get the top over my breasts, and I really had to tug to get it there. It is very cute, but definitely not long enough."
2.0,"I was disappointed with this hat. It’s flimsier than I expected and the brim isn’t shaped as shown - and trying to reshape it didn’t work very well (the waviness that shouldn’t be there isn’t resolved by the wire at the edge of the brim). It will provide ventilation, but I might worry about sun burn.<br /><br />My navy hat was a much lighter shade of blue (more true blue versus navy) that what’s shown here."
2.0,"Just didn't look right on me, but it was fine and would have worked on some.  I returned though."
2.0,Quality was good very disappointed
2.0,loved the look and color but unfortunately it arrived with a cracked face cover.
2.0,Colors were pretty other than the material was faded. The inside of it wasn’t durable enough. The oil’s for my hair came through it was all over my pillow.
2.0,"I could have downloaded a picture for nothing and did my own iron on. I expected, for the price a better quality."
2.0,Does not have a drop on shoulder. Fit like a blouse
2.0,This 3X garment as obviously sized for a different region of the world it is a small 2X at best.
2.0,Definitely not a 3XL..  I actually wear an XL 14/16 but I sized it up out of fear.  The top fits like an XL which is fine but the bottoms 😞...the bottoms were more like a medium. I couldn't even get them over my hips even with material I thought would stretch.  At first glance they look like my fleece tights...
2.0,Not water proof😕 very dissapointed. It is cute & could use it as a wind breaker.
2.0,"I ordered these after buying the smaller heart tags. The images on the heart ones came out so nice and clear that I decided to purchase these bigger ones. I ordered three of them and they all came out orangish and one had lines on the image. I was disappointed because I really liked the results of the heart ones even though the images scratch off easily. I really think they should check the product before they ship it or reprint them if there is an issue with the ink or production. It would also be nice if the images lasted longer. Otherwise, they make great little gifts. Luckily these were for me and the better ones were gifts. I ordered more and I’m nervous to receive the new ones."
2.0,"after wearing this color a few times, i noticed the following things. otherwise it's not bad.<br /><br />-if you wear a dark colored thong, it shows through<br />-if you sweat a lot, the color bleeds and stains your skin (hips, hamstrings, buttocks)<br />-if you use the toilet after a sweaty workout, the stain transfers onto the toilet seat and the stain is still on your skin (gross)"
2.0,Cute but cheaply made... was hoping for something better made.
2.0,"Great build material and nice aging color. Very detailed stitching. However, the pull tab didn't last long."
2.0,"These are soft yoga pants.  The fabric is lovely with a nice hand feel to it.  However, the front to back rise in the pants has a most uncomfortable seam that makes it impossibly uncomfortable to wear just around the house.  I wouldn’t  think about wearing them for yoga practice.  The vendor needs to correct this problem as well as some shortness in the leg and loose ankle fit."
2.0,I've bought several pairs of lenses from Revant. This is the first pair that will not fit in the frame. Had to send them back. But the return process was easy.
2.0,"Great fabric but was as long as a knee high dress...not flattering at all.  Sleeves too long, sadly."
2.0,It is cute but not a dress more like a shirt
2.0,Dress looks great and fits ok. However the fabric feels very uncomfortable. Fabric feels like a water resistant table cloth.
2.0,"Seem authentic and well made but poor cut/design! They are very stiff and the material is so heavy it’s hard to move in them. I think the package weighted five pounds! Anyway, the waiste is HUGE and there is no way to take them in. So you need a bigger waist then butt for them to fit. I got a size 40 and coursing button them. I normally wear. 4 in shorts. I’m 5’4 and 125 and athletic."
2.0,Not what I expected arms are small and the dress was super short
2.0,There wore not like they discribe and wore not those colors eather
2.0,its too small for my boobs but underwear is alright.
2.0,"Amazing buy!  Good watch, cheap strap."
2.0,These came very small and very short. They are definitely a low-rise style. I'll be sending them back.
2.0,I didn’t realize these come in different sizes! They straps aren’t adjustable so pay attention. The red is also more like a pink but I like them!!
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress. fabric is good quality, and very true to picture. HOWEVER I am a bit busy (34DD) and the sides by the armpit pucker because of this/ disappointed, ahd to return. wanted to wear to a wedding."
2.0,I purchased the dress and it is very cute.  I was going to buy XXL but was recommended to buy the large.  What a mistake!  I could not zip it up and broke the very cheap straps.  I should have returned it.
2.0,One gem had already fallen out of the crown when it arrived.....and several more fell out with use.  Expected better quality for the price.  Thank goodness for gorilla glue.
2.0,"Couldn't even open these! Totally stuck. Other than that, they look exactly as pictured & came nicely packaged. If ya can't wear them tho, what's the point?"
2.0,Would order a size smaller next time<br />Great otherwise
2.0,"First, these run way too small! Second, I'd knock myself out if I tried any kind of exercise in them. I got them just to sleep in and lounge around the house. The uniboob is so bad that it's super uncomfortable to sleep in them."
2.0,"liked the style but did not fit well after two tries, so returned both"
2.0,Had a few little holes on the side by the blue part. Put them on for a workout did a few squats and the pants got a run in them.....yep like pantiehose a run down the butt.
2.0,Does not cover a larger size chest at all... I even sized up... Still does not cover half my chest. Cute dress other than that.
2.0,"This shirt was Way Too Small, Unless you're a Child in which case it may be perfect... Except that the actual color doesn't look anything like the images online, which might cause you to request a return/refund...Except that they require YOU to pay return shipping to California at a cost equal to the cost of the shirt... Save your time and money, look at shirts sold by American companies. IMHO."
2.0,it is a lovely skirt ...I do not like that it does not fit at all
2.0,"I love coach shoes and this pair is certainly beautiful. They are well-made and fit well. However, the description provided says that the color is “oxblood”. I had thought that would be more of a wine/reddish color. In fact the color is definitely purple or egg plant. I’ll be returning them."
2.0,"Flimsy and not very flattering, had to return."
2.0,Product fits as expected but I was sent the wrong color sweater
2.0,muy lindo pero muy pequeño
2.0,The clothes themselves are really soft and really nice quality... my only problem is these pants were for my daughter who has sensory issues and I was sent 2 completely different pairs of pants. One is gray and one is black and has stars both with 2 raised stripes on the sides. My daughter won't wear them because the stripes bother her sensory issues. I order from here quite frequently so im just upset that I didn't get what I ordered...
2.0,They were ok at first but I guess after washing them they shrunk a bit. It fits as it did before on length but the part on top barely cover my toes anymore. It kinda defeats the purpose. Good price though but didn’t work well for me.
2.0,"Great colour, navy/cobalt. BUT it has a horrible chemical smell. I've had the bag airing for 3 days it's just starting to dissipate. The texture of the bag is ok. Was able to get everything in the purse today that I take to work so hopefully in a couple of days I'll be able to use it."
2.0,"This dress is frumpy from the fabric to the fit. It’s like a scratchy,ridged fabric. The back is so terrible it’s as if they cut it without understanding women would be wearing it. Going back."
2.0,The right earpiece broke suddenly and flew into the back seat as I was driving and not even touching them. I still wear them but the right side does dig into my temple.  Love the fit and tint and would buy more except for that problem.<br />Thanks
2.0,Not happy about this product this time at all.  Fluffy Padding inside came apart  after couple days of wear. My bf was not happy about it. Cuz it ended up hurtong hid feet while he was at work. Will not buy those again. Better of getting the ones withought fluffy padding
2.0,this dress overall is a cute dress however the fabric is quite thin. the top of the dress is way to loose.
2.0,Sadly the hearts are not matching as seen in Picture. They should update photo so you know what you’re getting.
2.0,I love it YET it was cracked when I got it but since I don't like sending things back I will just use it at work:)
2.0,The mom life font is more of an orange color that what is pictured but fits great. True to size
2.0,Belly showed in front
2.0,Got it out of packaging tried it on noticed a hole on the shirt right in the middle top where wit would show.
2.0,"What I didn't like most about this product is the top of the hat. The picture showcase it as being curved and flat, not curved, sticking up and pointed; which gave the hat a different look."
2.0,"It’s not as pink/copper as I wanted, for being called rose gold. Closer to yellow. Sizing is accurate."
2.0,"I loved the bag from the moment i opened it. It was perfect for what i bought it for. I use it on a daily basis as i carrys all the most important items i carry on a daily basis. Sadly less than a month has gone by and it's already starting to fall apart. I assume this may be a good choice for a teenager or even someone who doesn't intend on using it on a regular basis. I've had it for 25 days total and it's already halfway to the point of being unusable. Very disappointing, because i had a different style from the same company in my wishlist and i fear I'll have to shop around for a company with a product that is made with more quality."
2.0,"For some reason, this product does not seem to be as elastic the last 2 times I tried it for some reason. I will be evaluating other products instead."
2.0,I wear a 2X. I bought 4X because product said it runs small. The upper portion did not fit. I could not zip it up.  The bottom dress portion was large enough and the length was good.  The pattern is as good.  The feel of the fabric was good. Too bad the upper part did not fit.
2.0,"More like a silky type bathrobe material, really not chiffon. More vibrant than the photo shows, and fit way big than expected"
2.0,The buckle that holds it closed cracks and breaks from opening and closing after a couple months. Slick material let’s it act like a bar of soap in your back pocket and may squirt the wallet out when you sit down.
2.0,"Dress is very clingy and tight and shows every flaw. Not flattering at all. Material is more spandex like then dressy. Doesn’t flow and the neckline makes you look fat. Unless your a size 2 and no fat rolls, this is not the dress you should get. Looks nothing on like it does on the perfect model"
2.0,"I don't like the way it feels on my skin.  It is not so and cozy like a cotton blend.  It's cute, but I have not worn it.  It's not worth the money to return theses type of items.  My daughter says it looks like  ""scrubs"", that you wear in a hospital."
2.0,too small...i wanted it bigger to hold all my work stuff
2.0,Size up 1 if not 2. Never wore. Missed return window
2.0,Item appears printed backwards.  The back looks like the front and visa versa.  Seller ssid thsy is how they come.  Did get full refund.  Was way cool idea but if they know ot looks tgat eas they should print the inverted image
2.0,The shoes were too small and I sent them back
2.0,"We bought these for my aunt.... she doesn't use Amazon and she needed some compression socks. The seem to be very narrow in the calf area, but I'm sure she won't have a problem since she doesn't have thick calves. I'll update as I get feedback from her.<br /><br />*UPDATE* so the person who these socks were for, they did not fit AT ALL! So we need to return them."
2.0,Zipper broke within two months of purchase. Loved the coffee color. Received many compliments on the bag but couldn't recommend it after the zipper broke.
2.0,Though these boots are cute you can not put your feet in and out of them without a struggle.
2.0,I loved this when I first got it. Now the necklace won't stay shut thus allowing the fitbit to fall out. I can't even use it anymore!
2.0,its poor quality and small not oversized as it says... also way bluer than looks in photo
2.0,"This dress is not like the picture, there is no side slit as advertised in the picture. Very confusing"
2.0,"The coat itself is great. Zipper on the other hand came bent and hard to zip. After a few times zipping & unzipping (adult help, my 9 y/o couldn’t do it), it seemed to get back to shape and was zip-able. However, first major snowfall the zipper broke completely, it was stuck in the middle with top & bottom of the jacket open. My luck, return window closed 3 days ago. My suggestion, check the zipper closely right away. (Picture is hard to see the bent part, sorry)"
2.0,"The shoes fit well, but something about how they are made isn't right.  They actually ""squeak"" when you walk. VERY annoying."
2.0,The flowers are a bit too much for me. However this was a very inexpensive item and I know a person who will love it. Am giving it to her.
2.0,If you order these pants make sure you understand their disclaimer that the sizes are described as &#34; Asian measurements.  The length was good but the waist was not.
2.0,"I am 6 ft tall and this top stops at the top of the waist band and the material is not as expected, it is scratchy and uncomfortable."
2.0,Missing half of the charms. The picture is very misleading. It shows that you get all these cute charms and you dont even get them. Very disappointed
2.0,"The shirt seems nice enough, but it is like parachute fabric to some extent.  So, I don't think I'd want to wear this in a humid climate.  However, my biggest disappointment is that I ordered a LARGE (my size for the past 30 years, including slim/athletic cuts) and I was barely able to get the buttons buttoned on this shirt.  I looked like a clown.  And yes, the tag says ""L.""  I need a large size for my shoulders and upper arms, not my gut.<br />I strongly suggest ordering the next size up and hope it will be big enough.<br />If China wants to sell clothing in the USA, could we please get the sizing correct?  How hard can that be?"
2.0,"It fit as expected but color wasn't as pretty as pictured. Washed it in cold water as instructed,  was very wrinkled, has to be ironed. Shrunk in cold water and hung to dry."
2.0,Too large and chipped after one wear
2.0,"Ordered Large, said they would fit mens 10.5 these were way to small if washed would not even cover the bottom of my foot. Nice socks though gave them to my daughter!"
2.0,"quality lacks as drawstring won't last very long, could have used grommets where string comes through the waist instead of a slit in the waistband."
2.0,"As in the picture these are beautiful in fact. And the findings are unique, considerably too unique in the pair I received. Ear loops are created at different lengths and angles. One is a gorgeous drop the other is a partial hoop. Dead on symmetry is something I demand in earrings so I won’t be keeping these... sadly because they are so pretty I wanted to get a pair in every color."
2.0,"I'm 6'4"" and it smashes my nose. There is no way I could wear this like the ways they show in the examples. Just wearing it as a mask is way too tight. I can't turn at all. My fiance' is 5'6"". She also can't wear this. She can't turn her head or it comes down. It also smashes her face. I thought it was due to my size so I had her try it. I can't find where there is a size selection anywhere here. I do not wear a large hat so I did not expect this to be an issue. They look great and if they weren't so uncomfortable, they would be wonderful."
2.0,Good but one size doesn't fit all.
2.0,Received DARK blackwatch plaid gloves. Picture showed BRIGHT blue & BRIGHT green w/black in a block plaid. Already have 2 prs of classic blackwatch plaid gloves; don't need a 3rd. I didn't open them.
2.0,"Colour not bright as shown in picture,"
2.0,The fabric has too much spandex that's why it kept riding up which made it uncomfortable. The style and the length is nice though.
2.0,"Very thin material, not particularly comfortable, prone to ripping. Would not purchase again, due to the the construction."
2.0,They style is nice but they have a tendency to slide down as you walk which is a bit concerning on my part
2.0,These boxers seem like good quality and attractive colors and patterns. However when we opened the box and held a pair up and they looked small. I put them through the washer and dryer. Now they shrunk up to a very small size. Size medium boxer now may fit someone who is maybe a 100 pounds. So if you order I would order several sizes up.
2.0,Looks nothing like the image. You have to keep it in direct sun for it to glow. Low quality of the chain and pendent.
2.0,It’s a bit see through but really cute print
2.0,"Reviews said to order a size up so I did, got 2XL shirt fits nice but the sleeves are about 3” short<br />Gonna give these away or cut the sleeves off"
2.0,Ordered a 2X so it would be loose but it’s way small
2.0,Teensy teensy teensy.  Will pass them on to a great-niece when she's a few years older.  Too tiny for adult ears.
2.0,Sleeves were way to small for the size of dress.  Better made than what you get at party city. Got lots of compliments on it.
2.0,It is like a mummy wrap...It makes every part of your body restricted turning a three dimensional woman into a two dimensional one restricting every area equally.  Size had to be increased from medium to XL and even then poor results.
2.0,This dress does not look at pictured! The flowers and material are completely different. Another case of someone taking a photo of a model in a cute dress and trying to remake a look alike using a different fabric. It’s polyester. The image looks like cotton.
2.0,Product was not very sturdy
2.0,"The wrist strap completely broke off after a couple of weeks of light use. Not just the removable clip part, but the part that is actually sewn into the wallet fell off. Thankfully I was just walking through a building when it happened and not at a concert, or else I would have lost the whole thing. The pull tab on the zipper for the change pouch fell off after a couple of months even though I never really used it. Everything else on this thing has been good. I can put my phone in it if it has a thinner case on it, so that's a plus. If this had come without the strap, I could give it 4 stars (taking one star due to the change pouch zipper). But since it came with it and it failed, I have to dock more stars."
2.0,Very dull. No brillance at all.
2.0,The chain was cheap.broke first time my Grand daughter put on.the rest was well done.very pretty..need to have better chains..
2.0,The pins to attach to the watch I have didn’t fit. Could have been designed much better
2.0,"DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL, RUNS VERY SMALL!  RETURNED BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE OFF!!!"
2.0,Fell apart within a month...
2.0,"Was comfortable, just didn’t fit"
2.0,Buckle to big will not go through levis belt loops  Nice bent though.
2.0,"Just received this, it is pretty and small. However, it broke the very 1st I tried it on to see how it looked. For paying $75 this is cheaply made. I would have expected better quality made necklace for that price! Returning this immediately."
2.0,"I thought these skirts would be a great choice for a hot-weather trip I was going on, however, they were extremely thin and the seams looked like they would come apart as some of the stitching was pulling before I even tried one on.  I only gave a 2-star because they felt and looked cheaply made. I don't think they would hold up for more than a couple of wears.  The colors were nice and what I was looking for but was dissapointed in the overall construction."
2.0,No stretch. Leg holes way to small and material had no stretch to put on properly. I returned when will I get my refund?
2.0,This dress is just not as cute as the picture. It's very large and not fitted. The material is strange as well. The print of the fabric looks cheap. Returned this.
2.0,"It's okay. The pocket is fine, I just wish the scarf was thicker. Very staticky and sticks to itself, not sure that it will be very subtle that there's something in the pocket. But I like the concept!"
2.0,I feel the rings included too many large pieces
2.0,the skirt is shorter than the pantie part so it is not the look that I was going for.  Makes it look like I have an extra layer over the bottom - not good.
2.0,Nice watch. Although it does not keep the time. I have to make corrections every 2 or 3 days.
2.0,"Item is decent... sleeves are a lil tight & too short... but I especially dislike vendors who send items that have no tags, wrinkle, & feel Like it’s been used or returned ☹️☹️☹️. I don’t like that at all. I’ll likely get the sleeves cut off to short sleeves and MAKE CERTAIN  that I WASH before wear, but I will not order from this vendor again.<br /> I like my items to have tags on them, nicely packed, and HAVE A FEELING OF NEW’NESS!<br />I Would not recommend if you know where I’m coming from… & feel the way that I do.<br />The only reason I’m not gonna send this dress back is BC at my job everyone is s’pose to wear something cc Black History Month on Monday 2/28/22… today is Wednesday & I prob will not be able to get an order back before Monday."
2.0,I love the feel of this watch. But I cannot get the watch hands and the digital time to match. I needed this to work for school and now am having to go ahead and order a new one again because I can’t get it corrected.
2.0,"It's a kind of smaller sized comparing to most other brands, but the quality is good. I am going to keep it and try to wear it."
2.0,"Beautiful to look at, but after its filled with cards and money, it won't snap.  Useless."
2.0,It worked for a while. But It stopped zapping and now is useless
2.0,"Unable to fit dress. It is not flattering on a slim build small frame bust and/or hips female. Wasted of money. Would not buy again.The material is nice,but I will never wear the dress😩"
2.0,will def gonna return this.. as you can see in the picture very poorly made.
2.0,"HUGEEEEEE watch I did not expect though.  Massive... looks average quality, works average quality.  You need to be a big guy to wear this one."
2.0,"The toe box is not tall or roomy enough, toes felt a bit cramped. It's too bad they decided to change the design. I have bought the Ghost for several years now and they fit perfectly until they came out with the Ghost 9."
2.0,It was really difficult to attach the band to the watch. I have tried several times. The pieces aren't attached like the other bands.
2.0,"This purchase was a mistake on my part. I did not read the details as thorough as I should. I relied more on the photograph and assumed with the fringe depicted the material would be cotton similar to a Turkish towel. In reality there is no fringe on the garment and the material is synthetic. The price is very good and if you don’t mind the synthetic material it is a good value for a long cover up, which is hard to find."
2.0,The arms were very tight on the small and medium sizes. Fabric was thin. Not worth the money.
2.0,They are cute but smell AWFUL! Does anyone know how to get rid of the smell from the thread?
2.0,It's a beautiful dress. Loved it however the top didn't stay up. I'm a small with a 34 bust bust it runs small a little tight. Zipper is hard to zip and catches on the material. So I had to return it ☹️
2.0,These were ok. I returned them because they were so heavy. Not bad if you are a cold person but I’m not and need something a little lighter.
2.0,Looks like a maternity dress very drab.
2.0,go 2 size's up
2.0,"Light weight with sun protection.<br />But try not to snag this t-shirt material on anything. It is not very strong, or resistant to any kind of snags. ie catching the material on anything! Even a fingernail!<br />Make do material for a cheap long sleeve t shirt! 2-3/5"
2.0,"Very cute on the model but very cheap/thin material. The body suit is see-through, normally with these bodysuits you go bra-less or pasties, but wouldn't be a smart idea unless you don't mind giving people a free show."
2.0,Great quality hat but HEMI stitching not straight and crooked to the bill.
2.0,Very stiff and not easy to put on but they keep my shoes dry
2.0,"The fit is good but the &#34;palm leaves&#34; look like weed, which makes sadly the suit look trashy"
2.0,The pattern is cute.  The fabric quality is low and warrants the 2 rating.  It really needs pockets.
2.0,The material was very weird
2.0,"The pictures made the dress look of higher quality, but upon receiving it the material was noticeably cheap--almost like costume material."
2.0,"Not compression at all. Loose fitting, silky textured material. I still use them to work out but if you're looking for something compression wise- buy something else. Bought a medium but could've bought a small."
2.0,"style is not as expected , too tide in belly which makes you look fat in the  belly area"
2.0,"Loved the design, wish they were a little better quality though!"
2.0,Unfortunately these do not stay on.  They are to large.  Was really hopeful they would based on other reviews.
2.0,"The halo broke the moment I took it out of the package and the wings are really pretty from the back, but facing someone you can see the cardboard underneath. Just cheap and I’m not impressed."
2.0,Bought this shirt for my teenager. The second time he wore it I noticed that there was cracking starting to appear in the material on the image. Disappointed that the quality wasn’t any better!
2.0,Runs way-small- couldn't even get them on over my butt. Nice fabric and color.
2.0,Love the color and style but it's to small in the arms that I can't answer.
2.0,Love it but it is way too small. I first got the 3x because it said it ran small and it was also too small. So I sent it back and ordered a 4x and it too was too small. I am so disappointed because I love it.
2.0,"Bought for my boyfriend and he loved them at first. A month later, they smell awful and he doesn't normally have smelly feet."
2.0,This isn't very flattering in person. Looked like a dress my great grandma would have worn to a funeral.
2.0,completely see through and very small.
2.0,"Pretty design and thick absorbent disks for the essential oils. Unfortunately as I was putting it on it slipped from my grasp, dropped onto the floor and broke apart (the pendant is not two pieces but four, with a disk-like tree image for each side as a separate piece adhered to each hinged circular piece). Beautiful and a great price but not very durable. In the photo you can see the tree image piece that broke apart."
2.0,"First of all, don’t do it if you’re busty.  I’m a DD and it didn’t fit at all.  Second, the dress was almost to the floor in the front and the back was so long it looked like it had a train.  I did order the correct size as all the American made dresses of size 12 fit perfectly.  Perhaps the manufacturer thinks if you are larger than an 8, they need to keep increasing the length.  I am 5’6 by the way.  Also beware, you have to pay for shipping both ways. The material was very nice that is why I’m giving it 2 stars."
2.0,"The material is very stretchy and has a lot of give. However, I did not like the way it looked on me once I tried it on."
2.0,"nice suit.<br />but very too small, I bought the 3x and I thing its really a L in american sizes.<br />maybe a medium.<br /><br />I expect to get into a swim suit fairly easily........not 25 minutes later, full body sweats. laying on the floor to breathe try on session.<br />i got the bottoms up to my mid thigh and started laughing, (*NOPE NOT GONNA HAPPEN)"
2.0,"Bought this to take on trips and They had the right idea when making this, but it does not even come close to a true body pillow, it has the correct size but not the correct shape. You can't really hug it like a true body pillow. I have learned to only blow it up about halfway and it helps a little. You can't bend it like you would want to.  I have stopped trying to use it."
2.0,Actual product was not as displayed. Sleeves are almost considered 3/4 not much of a sweater as portrayed in image.
2.0,The fabric was stiff and the dress had no shape -- it didn't look like the photos at all.
2.0,"It was nothing like the picture! The middle part wasn’t enough material, the split went up to my navel ."
2.0,The necklace is NICE but it is thinner than it looks in the picture and I'm not sure that it's a full 2mm wide.
2.0,Dress was not as long as I expected and it had no shape to it at all.
2.0,I purchased this and even got it in a x-large because I want length to wear with leggings. The photo gives the impression that is long anyway. I am 5'2 and it won't even cover my bottom...  Will just give away and mark it off as a lose and lesson learned...  Just Sad
2.0,My daughter couldn’t wear them. They clamped on so hard that they hurt to put on and off
2.0,"Dress is cute, but comes one size smaller and is very see through.  I had to return."
2.0,Not as soft as other t-shirts I’ve ordered and ran smaller. May return since prime offers free returns.
2.0,"The dress was fine.  The print placement was the problem.  When worn, the print ending up with medallions centered on my boobs.  This made it look like I had targets placed over my chest with my nipple area as the center of the targets. I was too lazy to return it, so I wear it to work in the garden, but, definitely, not in public."
2.0,ultra narrow fit in chest and shoulders
2.0,These are very cheaply made but useful for their intended purpose.
2.0,Best suited small women and adolescents. Stitch quality seems good at least but if you're buying this for a male with an average or above average sized head keep searching elsewhere.
2.0,Actually gave it to my mom it runs small but it's a very pretty top and I did like the way it was cut!
2.0,"It'll do for an emergency. I've had much better quality 6"" umbrellas before."
2.0,It was actually what u paid for.
2.0,These are cheaply made of plastic material and me wearing a size 10 shouldn't have had an issue with this fitting around my slim waistline. I had a nearly 3 inch gap in the back that looked ridiculous. These need to be marketed as junior sizing
2.0,Too small gave it to my daughter.
2.0,"The fabric is beautiful, but it is way, way too small. I ordered a 2XL, my usual size. Once I was able to squeeze my hips into it, I was only able to bring the bra section to about my waist. I'm not that tall, only 5'6&#34;. It's advertised as a &#34;High Waisted One Piece Swimdress&#34;, but you'd have to be pretty short for this suit to be &#34;high waisted.&#34;"
2.0,Much smaller than what I thought.. Little disappointed
2.0,"The hat itself fine but is unwearable due to the way it is shipped - folded into quarters, can you believe it?  Perhaps a clothing steamer will take out the fold marks.  If it doesn't, I'm returning it."
2.0,The fabric is soft and comfortable but far too thin for me. I am a mom of 3 and this shows every imperfection and bump. It is not flattering on me at all!
2.0,Purchased a 2xl and it doesn’t fit me at all being a normal 1X-XXL. Please give yourself a size or two up! 2 stars because it is exactly as the photo and description read. Nice quality tank top... which is great if it fits!
2.0,"Hat was faded color. Didn't look ""new"". Other than that was ok. Was expecting it to be navy, not faded navy color."
2.0,"Beautiful stockings but they squeeze your thighs with the elastic band and make my thighs look unflattering. I get muffin top thighs. Im not a very big lady, I'm 5'3&#34; and 115 pounds,  thigh circumference where it sits is about 22&#34;. I dont know about you but I'm highly not a fan of muffin top thighs."
2.0,I love the product. The price point is on target but the wait of 2.5 months was a bit excessive.
2.0,The scarf felt cheap and it had an odor to it. The beads were very large and the scarf was to long. It overwhelmed the neck area.
2.0,I have had this less than a week. I've had to reset the time multiple times. And the digital part keeps changing to military time.
2.0,I needed pants for my daughter quickly and found some Lands End on Amazon... But no sizes are listed. Decided to buy a pair just to see. These are Girls size 8 with a un-hemmed inseam.
2.0,This is for sure not a classic jersey cotton t shirt. It’s more of a cheap dry fit material. Still a cool shirt though. Runs small.
2.0,Very tight for a large.  Horrible quality of material and print. Not worth what you pay or have to wait for.
2.0,"Bought two of them, for me and my best friend... It has both our favorite colors for the stones... A lil dissatisfied, as the black had rubbed off and turned our fingers colors.  I might just remove the rest of the black..."
2.0,"Although the product is what I expected, the design of where the straps hook on the back was not clever. It's difficult to put on without a second person around to help or without giving yourself a wedgie. If you have the straps hooked in and try pulling your arms through, the hooks almost always come undone. Very irritating. The material is of good quality and it fits as expected. Good coverage and support."
2.0,Thin fabric. I returned it.
2.0,"They fit fairly well and felt very comfortable when I first got them. Over a period of 3 months they have stretched out and feel loose now. Also, they are supposed to be machine washable but after the 3d wash the sole split. I never put them in the dryer, I let them air dry. It's too bad because they were great at first."
2.0,Has a very strange smell
2.0,One of the lenses fell out within a week of receiving it. It can be popped back in OK enough but is more prone to popping out again. Not my go-to sunglasses but keeping it around as a spare.
2.0,The mask came arrived almost melted. Luckily I got another mask in time for my convention
2.0,Not great if you have metal allergies. Along with this the post on one of the earrings was not centered and the &#34;diamond&#34; was chipped. They look nice from a distance but I would not recommend.
2.0,Did not look not fit the way presented.
2.0,Shorts fell apart at waist seam.
2.0,This ring represent certain religious and for a lot of customers is kind of offending.  They need to change the name or explain more detail what the ring with the star mean!!!!
2.0,Very ordinary looking and ill fitting robe. Returning it.
2.0,"This is child size! Like, for a 5 year old at best. Very thin material....disappointing"
2.0,The material is pretty thin and the design is  off center and it’s very noticeable. It’s just not made very well and is cheap looking. It’s not flattering at all.
2.0,a little awkward. I wore it once and donated it.  It sheds like CRAZY.
2.0,"Very upset.<br />This dress is not as pictured. It's got the shiny wine colored taffeta and pretty lace overlay, but the skirt is NOWHERE near as full as pictured, which is what would give it the vintage feel I was looking for. Useless for what I needed it for. Very upset as this was for a special occasion and an authentic vintage look is required. I am attaching a photo to show the difference. The stock image shows a full skirt, the skirt is not full at all."
2.0,Runs small ordered daughter normal size and they where to small her toes couldn’t straighten out comfortably. So I compared they to a pair she had in the same school size and at least a half an inch shorter.  Appear to be good quality though just order up a size if you can I couldn’t they didn’t have a size up so had to return.
2.0,I would not order theses bandanas again. They had a very strong chemical smelling odor. I had to wash them before I used them.
2.0,My eyes hurt after using these for over 30 minutes on a FHD computer screen.  I wonder if they work.
2.0,"These look so much better in the picture then in person.  If you are slim, forget it! They are huge, baggy and really frumpy looking. They look cheap."
2.0,Great product but after one full shift the Velcro adjustable strap on the right club started to rip off and the touchscreen won’t respond to the right and I can bring
2.0,super cute but definitely size up about 2 sizes.
2.0,"Like the weave pattern, but the socks don't feel cottony enough. Tough finding socks made with high cotton content. All these petroleum-based fabrics advertised as being cool and absorbent are a bunch of bunk. 90+% cotton or wool is where it's at, but try finding it. Plus, these fiber mixes don't biodegrade!"
2.0,"I wouldn't consider these to be ""compression"" type tanks. They ride up very easily, they have zero compression to them. The material does wick though."
2.0,"I received the screen protector on March 27, so I've had some time with it a fair review. The product arrived on time in great packaging. It was easy to apply, so no problems there. However, I did notice that there seemed to be a lot of air bubbles but I assumed that was on my part, so I just pressed them out until they were gone. But a few days later they started coming back, no matter how much I pressed them out and now the entire middle portion of my screen is no longer sticking, and it seems to be spreading to the outside portion. Eventually my screen won't stick to my phone any longer. I'm not sure if I received a faulty product or what, but this is disheartening. It does offer great privacy protection since anyone sitting next to me can't look over and see what I'm doing, but it looks like I won't have this for no longer than 2 weeks since it won't stick to my phone anymore. Becareful when buying."
2.0,"I was really disappointed that these do not have a complete thumb. I had purchase these to replace an old pair of mittens I had that finally ripped. The portion that covers the fingers is great, but i don’t understand why the thumb is “fingerless” as well and does not have any cover. Not suitable to use in the winter where I live unless I want my thumb to freeze."
2.0,I’ve worn the dress twice and the seem just under the chest has already begun to need repairs. Love the dress but disappointed in the quality
2.0,"The fit is very good on the face, however these are NOT 100% cotton, they feel like they also have nylon or cotton.<br />They also are very thin and if you sweat they will end up sucking into your nose and mouth, making it impossible to breathe."
2.0,"I haven't even tried the product yet and it looks like it has been used. There is sealant all over the bottle, the label is partially scuffed off. I can't even read the instructions completely. I am pretty disappointed. I bought the product because of the positive result reviews, so we will see how it works. I won't return because it's inexpensive enough."
2.0,"Pretty but completely the wrong size. Listing description says they are 1.5cm long, and they are 1.5 inches long. Huge difference. Sime of them also were dull and had glue around them.."
2.0,"The fabric of the shirt felt fine, but the screen print was heavy and felt like plastic. I believe after being washing and dried once or twice the image will begin to crack severely."
2.0,"Got this for my helix piercing. I was shooting for a minimalist look, so I thought this would be ideal. I received the earring and couldn’t even put it on. It was so tiny and the barbell is smaller than expected. I got another earring with the same barbell length and it fits better.<br /><br />Disappointed :("
2.0,These will not stay closed while I’m wearing them.
2.0,i love the color it’s pretty but the glasses sit crooked on my face annoying. Does anyone know if the lens can be popped out and put in a different pair of frames?
2.0,These are too cute. Couple complaints tho. They were a bit snug on my feet and I wear a 8-9 typically. Also the lace around the big toe lasted through one day of wear. They should have the toe area reinforced
2.0,"Had to return it, the shoulder holes were not anywhere near as pictured. One hit at the back of my shoulder. Also the stitching was hit and miss. The neck binding was pieced together with white thread which made it very obvious against the blue fabric."
2.0,"First off, got an XL despite usually wearing an L. The shoulder width is way too short, it literally ripped open the back first time wearing it. Second it's too long, we had to hem the bottom about 4 inches to keep it from dragging on the ground. And the wrist braces don't stick, they fall off almost immediately. Overall stay away from this product, even if it does look really good the dimensions are just horrific."
2.0,"This is a child’s hat, not suitable for an adult."
2.0,"Will not stay flat and parts of the necklace keep shifting.  From the feedback of others plus the photos posted, it appears that this could be caused by being somewhat more bony in the collarbone area.  Plan to try to tack the pieces on the underside of the necklace in an effort to resolve these issues."
2.0,Very nice case included .. glasses themselves will bend easy after first few wears. Not sturdy as I would like.
2.0,Cute dress but you have to have a full body slip under it! It was also a little too short for me so I returned.
2.0,Too small on the top
2.0,They turned my nose blue they are not as described
2.0,Loved this so much !!!!!! but had to wash before I wore it.  Cold water.  Went from kimono robe to kimono shirt  Super sad !
2.0,"I received this top on time and it fit great, also great quality, but the fabric was fitly with allot of dirt and dust on it."
2.0,Hay que pedirlo una talla más grande.
2.0,"I'm typically a large but ordered an XL to allow room for bulky tops. The outer layer is oversized and shaped poorly and the inner later is great, however, the inner layer of XL fit perfectly so couldn't order the jacket in a L knowing the inner layer would not fit. It's a PASS for me."
2.0,"These are really really big, even the smallest pairs are HUGE in diameter. I got these for my daughter which likes my 14 gauge earrings like this and she wanted to trick her dad into thinking I let her get her ears gauged. (wrong, I know but very funny if you know our relationship). The smallest pair is huge on her ears and a lot larger than my 14 gauge surgical stainless ones. They are also very cheap looking as compared to the picture."
2.0,"Runs extremely small. I usually wear size L and can sometimes fit M, ordered XL and it looked like a small. Order 2 or 3 sizes up!!"
2.0,"This is not a dress... it is straight up a shirt. It doesn't even cover my butt. Tall people be Warned.... I am 6""1."
2.0,"The product is adequately made, however... the shape in the photo is totally misleading. It appears oval or rounded with an indented bottom to grasp the bracelet cuff and hold it in place. It is NOT! It is a tall trapazoid with straight sides with the widest part at the bottom. This requies that the bracelet be stretched at the opening in order to be put onto it; and there is no indent at the bottom so the shape of the bracelt becomes altered. The pressure at the bottom is the only thing holding it in place and with open space along the sides and top - so no support there.<br /><br />VERY POOR customer relations from Sanas. It takes them days to respond to emails if they even deign to respond. I'm not even sure whomever read the emails even understood what my concerns/questions were because they never directly addressed them. After several email go-'rounds, lasting over 2 weeks, they finally said I could return the item but they only MIGHT credit my return shipping. After the cost of the display ($4.99) and the shipping ($5.99) that I already paid it just didn't make financial sense to return it.<br />Sanas may have been unimpressed/unconcerned because of my small order (soooo sad!) but there were several other items from Sanas that I was considering buying in the future, but NO MORE!!!<br /><br />So, it's the old adage - Buyer Beware - you get what you pay for!<br /><br />The bottom line is that Sanas needs a better description for its product/s along with photos that actually show the correct shape/s not to mention a complete overhaul of their customer relations dept!"
2.0,The pants fit in the waist but to short on length
2.0,"Fit alright, but the quality was nothing special so I returned it."
2.0,"The quality is fine for the price but this necklace is by no means a choker. It’s over a foot and a half long, it’s a long necklace. Dips far beneath my collar bone. Do not purchase if you’re looking for a choker!"
2.0,"Had to return these. I don't give many bad reviews, but these were sub par and the inner soles slid around quite a bit, becoming uncomfortable to walk or job in. The fit was a bit awkward, which can be a big deal with footwear that you need to fit like a sock. They did refund my purchase quickly, so I would say there is no real risk if you want to see if they work for you."
2.0,I really hated the polyester feel of the fabric. I was expecting more of a beachy linen. It was not flattering on me at all.
2.0,Made for a child.Way to small.
2.0,"Got this as a gift for my wife, and she finally started using it last month, she got it a bit wet while washing her hands yesterday and the glue that holds the strap to the metal snap that goes to the watch came undone. Luckily it was at home or she would have lost her watch"
2.0,Like the look and functionality of this purse however have only had it 4 maths and the edges of each of the straps has frayed.  A black seam has torn off and now there are strings showing.  Good design but poor quality.  Don't waste your money.
2.0,"The shirt fits well, is soft cotton and the stitching is strong but after just a few washes, the letters are almost completely worn off.  Just a blue shirt."
2.0,I bought 2 pairs  for my son they are suber cute but this os what happened after 2 day usage i will return them
2.0,"I don’t have diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but a well padded sock made of soft, comfortable fabric is important to me, because I do hours of standing and walking every day, and extensive amounts of either of those activities can make anyone’s feet get sore if they are not properly protected.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />1. The socks are loose fitting, especially the upper portion.<br /><br />2. They are mostly made of cotton: 73% cotton, 23% polyester, 3% nylon.<br /><br />3. They can be put in the washer and dryer.<br /><br />4. They have a slight amount of padding in the toe and heel area.<br /><br />5. They are made in the USA.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1. The fabric of these socks feels uncomfortably scratchy against my skin. It made them unwearable for me.<br /><br />2. I have some Thorlo unisex athletic socks (ASIN ‏B09V8FWSGD) that are much softer and better padded than these. They cost almost three times as much as these, but they are far more than three times better in terms of quality and comfort."
2.0,Very cheap quality!
2.0,"The printing is done well but it's printed on a garbage Hanes shirt.<br /><br />Save your money, find something not printed on garbage.<br /><br />This is definitely an attempt to put lipstick on a pig.<br />(To those of you that don't know, there's a saying about putting lipstick on a pig in a superficial, yet futile, attempt to make garbage look better)"
2.0,"Took the dress out of the bag and one of the gems immediately fell off.  I had the dress professionally hemmed and altered.  I wore the dress to an Adult Prom.  By the time i left the venue, nearly all the gems were missing with long stings hanging all around.  The dress was gorgeous but the craftmanship was shotty to say the least."
2.0,"This is definitely a nice top, but the length of it is much too short.  When you raise your arms, it easily reveals your abdomen well above the belly button."
2.0,"I wear a size eight, ordered a Large to be on the safe side.  The dress is good quality however; the zipper would difficult to pull down, I had to have my daughter assist me.  After trying it on, the zipper once again was difficult to pull down.  Not good!  I have an hour glass figure with a large butt, if you have a nice large butt this dress might to fit you well."
2.0,nothing like web description.  Returned
2.0,"Every piece is super cute but I was having a heck of a time trying to get the ball spun on to hold it in, they were way to small and just more trouble then I found them to be worth. A tad bit disappointed."
2.0,"Very pretty piece!<br />Yes, it was a good price, but arrived broken so I had to pay to have it repaired as it was a gift."
2.0,"I ordered this skirt in Medium, it fit like a Large (12-14).  Fabric felt very uncomfortable and like it wouldn't breathe.  From the photos I was expecting something more flowy, but this was stiff and had a cheap-polyester sheen to it.  The cut was nice, and had this been a better material I would have sized down and repurchased.  I sent this back."
2.0,Shirt runs small and I dont care for material looks like pjs.
2.0,"Very disappointed with this too, it’s not a cozy knit top like it looks like, it cheaply made and the length is way to short! I’m an average height. I bought it in two colors so double disappointment."
2.0,It tarnished after few wear. I wish it last longer👎🏻
2.0,It was too thin and kept coming out of my ears
2.0,This is not true to its size!
2.0,There are not zip off pants as listed
2.0,"Not true to size, runs small. If you have muscular/sizeable arms or chest be mindful of sizing.<br /><br />Wasn't even close to fitting me, so I easily returned via Prime."
2.0,"Way too big for my needs. There is no way to adjust the bracelet to fit a small woman's wrist. It just falls off. It is more of a man's bracelet. The laser engraving is just okay. It looks more like it is printed on the metal and is a little hard to read. Also, it was supposed to come with a velvet jewelry bag, but it didn't. It came in a zip lock bag with a little card that said to keep it in the supplied velvet bag. Since it is customized, I cannot return it so, for me it was basically a waste of money. If you need a bracelet for a small wrist, or even a meduim sized one, look else where."
2.0,"The design is unique and beautiful. Smaller than what I expected after two weeks wear this ring. The ring had poor condition, rust and flak paint!"
2.0,Not gpod quality. The wristband broke in less than 5 months. Don't buy it
2.0,I like the concept but on opening the pkg one ear ring cuff broke in half led me to confirm that the quality is questionable.
2.0,"The color could’ve been more pale. On the packaging, it said it was a size M (probably for medium), and it would’ve been nicer if a bigger size was available. The shirt I received was a turtle neck, which was not in pictured in the image. I’ll still wear it, but it wasn’t what I expected and wanted to get."
2.0,It’s to big!
2.0,"tried a pair, was crooked, twisted at the frame.  replacement was the same. shipping was fast, replacement and refund was done so company was good for that."
2.0,It didn't fit as good as I would have liked
2.0,Very wide and not long enough
2.0,"Ugh. I ordered this twice in hopes that this would be long enough for me to wear. I'm 5'9, 150 and I really wanted this to work. Online, I always order a size or two larger than I usually wear because size never feels accurate. Initially I ordered the XL, this was okay length wise but I wanted it a little longer. I returned and got a 2X instead, and it was too short in the arms and only gave an inch or so more in the length. This is a great fit for average sized ladies, but for us taller ones I wouldn't even bother trying to make it work."
2.0,"I like them, but they're very THIN and see through and are very large. almost fits like the tall and curvy from luluroe. and i'm not tall and curvy."
2.0,"The dress is nice. However not for me. I was disappointed because I purchased the gray and loved that it is heavy. Perfect for early winter and comfortable. I decided to buy the red and black too. I am returning the red. Waiting to see the black. I hope it is the heavy material. Please be more accurate when describing the material. I purchased size large so it is loose and comfortable. I normally wear a medium. Thank you. By the way, I have washed the gray dress in cold water and put in dryer on normal cycle. Great on the go dress for my job . You can dress up or down."
2.0,I returned this product. It was too bulky than I expected. I was looking for something very sleek.<br />If you are ok with the size (its same as a normal formal wallet) the product seemed amazing..
2.0,This was a gift and the person enjoyed it until broke 5 months later. It didn't get caught on anything. It just broke and the beads went everywhere.
2.0,Cute shirt but fabric was very thin and you. Oils see through the short. One would have to use an undershirt.
2.0,After one day of my girl wearing to school one clasp broke from the beads ( I can fix but shouldn’t have to after 1 day) also wire sticking out of both sides.<br />Super cute but won’t buy again or recommend.
2.0,They made it to  small in the chest I always buy this size
2.0,"I am 5' 8'' with a large chest (42 E). The top &#34;fit&#34;, but it wasn't flattering.The back rode up and then the front sunk down. No support whatsoever.<br /><br />I followed my measurements to a T on their size chart. Like I said, it fit, But wasn't a great match if that makes sense.<br /><br />The bottoms fit and covered the cheeks, but the waistband was very tight. It pushed all my skin around my stomach out. So it was a nice tummy suck in, but everything above the waistband got all squished.<br /><br />So I guess maybe if you had less post baby chest and hips, it'd be a better fit haha<br /><br />Loved loved the colors! So bright.<br /><br />I was really hoping this could be a good fit, but it wasn't. Maybe it could be for you. Just keep in mind that the waistband was VERY tight."
2.0,They will replace the glasses with what I presume is the same product that does not fit. I am book marking them to avoid.
2.0,"I LOVE the earrings - they are beautiful - however, I am unable to wear them.  The stems were bent flat and I cannot wear the earrings."
2.0,"If you like polyester or cheesy fabrics, this top is for you. The style is cute but the feeling was not good when I put it on."
2.0,"The watch looks really cheap, The band is terrible.  Just purchase a ring from tree hut. I am going to try and redeem this watch with a new band."
2.0,"Cheap looking, could maybe get one wear."
2.0,Don't like it. Sent it back in 5 min.
2.0,Wasn't true to size at all. Disappointed.
2.0,"Do not buy it.  It will not say Adventure Awaits, it is random letters.  I tried to order it twice and it always says the same thing.  Unfortunate, very comfy shirt."
2.0,I ordered 3 of these bracelets. I was so disappointed when I received them as one of the bracelets was out of the plastic package and was broken.
2.0,"I am 5’1 and curvy. The pink is absolutely see-through. I can see this working on someone who is smaller. For starters, I had no idea it was ribbed. I am also a 38DDD, so that could add to the transparency. It truly just did not look good on me. That does not mean it cannot work on everybody else!"
2.0,To small to read and lettering not dark enough
2.0,For the money it cost....it should last longer. The material is peeling.
2.0,The cufflinks are nice and nice designs on tie clips but the tie clips to let you know is not for the newer style skinny ties and are for standard size ties and also are actually alittle too big for the standard ties also. Not really the size you want for a tie clip and the cufflinks don't stay any of my button shirts correctly and slide out too easily. They look nice but not good when I received them. I hope this helps as I will not be ordering from them again.
2.0,"The design looks neat and would have been really cute, if it weren't so big. This thing is very large and heavy, not what I imagined. Approx 3 inches across."
2.0,"I really liked this product, but it said it was hot pink, and it is more of a muted maroon! Will definitely be returning."
2.0,Not a soft material. I ordered longs because I am<br />Rather tall and need a 34&#34; inseam and I n ow regular would have been too short. The seam<br />Of the pant also turns in and looks sewn wrong. Good price for a set but now I know why; poor quality. Sometimes you get what you pay for. I won't be buying this brand again
2.0,"What I received was not what I ordered. I ordered the oversize pullover with pockets. The pattern was similar, but it was short in length  & the sleeves were short too, & there were no pockets."
2.0,"I (and my son) liked these shoes enough to order them twice. The first set did not come with a charging cable, so we returned them and got another set that did have the cable. Well, now it is 3 months later and only one shoe will charge.  I assume it is too late to do anything about it now, but I would expect a product to work longer than 3 months. My 8 year old and I are very disappointed."
2.0,"Rough material zipper pockets hurt my hands looking for<br />My keys the elastic on the pant leg stretched out in the first wear. So it kept sliding down my leg, you have to sag it to look like the picture , so if you do t mind your butt hanging out it will look dumb and tight not all cool loose looking like the picture"
2.0,"the material is thinner than I expected, I don't like it when you can see the toes through the socks."
2.0,"I like the style, and the material is very nice. Price is great but I purchased<br /> a 2xx using your size chart and it ended up being SO SMALL. I decided to give them to my daughter who is a X-SMALL to SMALL.<br />I believe that if China or other countries are going to sell things in the US, which is OK, however, they should make clothes etc. that actually fit Americans and adjust their size charts to fit Americans."
2.0,"1st of all, measure yourself.  Then do it again.  Add a few inches. Then buy the next size up!<br />I have NEVER been an XXL before in my LIFE!  I'm 5'8 and 140lbs.  It's snug.<br /><br />As for the dress... where the heck is the poof!?!?<br />It's made out of the same material as medical scrubs.... the Wal-Mart brand.<br /><br />It got here fast though. So, they do have that going for them!"
2.0,Cheaply made.  Will last maybe 6 months if I'm lucky. Cute color fun a summery.  Works to see *better*
2.0,This belt  is so thin . I got it thinking it was a normal belt but the width is very small and it doesn't nickel it just loops behind the buckle in a weird way and doesn't stay . If I had something to wear a very thin belt with it would be ok I guess but it not for jeans it's just to thin  .
2.0,Material is super heavy
2.0,"Nice but the color was completely different than pictured, light light blue, almost white. Disappointing,  they seem like nice plugs, just completely wrong color"
2.0,I ordered a Large and received a large bottom with a 2XL top.... lol
2.0,"I like that they're cheap. Not even $10. I don't like that I ordered them on the 3rd(ish) and it's the 29th and they are already broken. The upper rim of the left eye piece is cracked already. I don't mistreat my stuff, I take really good care of it. I usually buy sunglasses in the $40 range and they have lasted me for YEARS without so much as a scratch.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk."
2.0,"Looks good, super cheap"
2.0,"The link remover that came with the watch was broken and unusable. The watch is ok, the face itself is nice but the band feels and looks extremely cheap. There are much more affordable watches on Amazon that are of higher/equal quality."
2.0,"I didn't order the plain beige bag, it was sent to me in error. So, I'm returning it. It's a hard plastic material and is really large. The design would have been nice if smaller and real leather"
2.0,I found this item to be of poor quality
2.0,It's cute but I returned it because there is zero support. I was hoping the fabric would be a little stronger/thicker. It's relatively flimsy and seems like it will stretch pretty soon in time.
2.0,"While this swimsuit is super comfy, be aware that the dye color runs and stains!!!!  I realized this as I leaned it against my hotel bathtub to dry and saw the blue had stained the tub!  Also the dye was all over me and managed to get on my kids too (since I carried them in the pool).  It also stained the chair I was sitting on. I expect some staining with new swimsuits but this one was just embarrassing!"
2.0,"Super cheap quality, broke as soon as I got it. The cheapness makes it unattractive. Not worth 25 cents"
2.0,Very see through bottoms! Mine has a tear down the front crotch. But the top was perfect!
2.0,The band does little stretching and these did not fit my son right.
2.0,"Got my second one of these.  The first one was pretty sturdy except that the steel mesh eventually got bent on the edge and created a snare that got caught all the time.  Really liked the look and feel so I got a second one.  The new one is about an inch shorter and the magnet doesn't hold very well.  If I shake my arm at all, even just enough to make the watch backlight come on, the band slips.  It slips all the time.  After about a month, the glue gave out on the magnet and I had to re-glue it.<br /><br />First one was nice but didn't last long.  Second one was a waste of money."
2.0,I am only 5'6&#34; and the sleeves on a LARGE came barely past my elbows.
2.0,This is not an off the shoulder dress. Just a wide neck.
2.0,"Even with careful measuring, the size was way off. I ordered a size up from the measurements and it was too snug across the bust."
2.0,Pants come way to small!
2.0,"These were okay, the material is very paper-like and somewhat uncomfortable with the stitching right where your legs rub together. But over all they are nice shorts to wear to the beach"
2.0,Was not size indicated
2.0,"Preety good for the first time until it was washed. FYI, regular home wash in washer.  Once washed, the color fades away and looks the t-shirt is way too old."
2.0,"This was the third trench I purchased to compare.  The coat was unlined and was a rough twill that wrinkled easily and looked worn.  I was not looking for a rugged looking coat, rather a more polished trench. I returned the coat."
2.0,finger turned green after only a few wear and doubt serious to try buy something similiar again especially for little girl
2.0,"This dress had potential but didn’t make the mark for me. The top is bulky, and while the bottom front is flattering, the back is really thin. Also, my product came with two food stains on it. So I’ll be returning."
2.0,This sweater is good quality but it runs really small. I would recommend going up two sizes! I had to return.
2.0,This product is from China just FYI. The sizing is way way off. I ordered the 6-12 month for my 8 month old. I ordered the 4-5 years for my 4 year old. I’d say order two sizes down. I added a picture for size reference. The picture has 6-12 month suit from  another company and this company’s suit behind it. It’s sooo big. The infant suits is easily a 2T. The 4-5 is easily a size 6. So bummed because we leave for vacation tomorrow.  My kids will not be able to wear these.
2.0,"Well, after a shower as a sleepwear, its great, but I thought I bought a dress to go outside.You cant do it, everything shows, and it looks like a underwear.Anyway, maybe it is good to dress over the swimsuit.....to be alone in the garden, where nobody except your family sees you....its cheap look.Sorry, but tastes are different."
2.0,Chintzy. You get what you pay for.  Sorry I fell for this watch.
2.0,I liked the style which is what attracted me in the first place but it doesn't cover enough in the front to provide any support.
2.0,"i was looking for a comfy hoodie with an oversized fit, but this is everything but that. the material isn’t great and being somebody who is picky about textures this is not for me. it’s also not flattering in any way."
2.0,One of the pieces was missing a crown (cannot set the time). Otherwise as expected.
2.0,The daisy looks like a splattered fried egg and the graphics is rubbery looking. Not at all attractive.<br />Plus beware this is NOT free to return and that is NOT posted anywhere I can find.
2.0,I had to replace these glasses because a peace between the arm and frame that spaces the two apart came off
2.0,Runs way too small than advertised
2.0,Great color. Ordered a large but fits like a medium.
2.0,"The only good thing about this top is the color. It's spot on. As for product description and visual?  Besides the color, everything else about this product is misleading.<br /><br />This is by no means a sweatshirt. The material is thin as an average shirt would be..when held up to the light you can actually see through it.. not even close to a &#34;sweatshirt&#34;. The collar does not sit as the picture shows, it lies flat on your shoulders because the material is so thin and flimsy. The style is not long as the picture shows. There is no length to it. It is short, sits a little below my waist and is full and boxy.<br /><br />I take a size M-L and ordered an XL so I could have room to wear another shirt under it. The size is accurate but the product description and picture shown are both way off."
2.0,Cute but arrived broken
2.0,It was okay but after one month the buckle broke. Little disappoint about that.
2.0,the fit is fine but the fabric is stiff and feels like Halloween costume quality- I had hoped to wear this for business casual setting but there's no way I can wear this at an adulting function
2.0,"I had hopes for this bag.  Those hopes did not materialize.  In fact I have put the bag away and probably will eventually discard it.  The principal problem is the design, particularly the placement of the handle.  The handle is attached to the main flap rather than to the body of the bag itself. This mean that when using the handle, the weight of the bag and items inside of it pull down on the flap causing the flap to separate from the cheaply attached magnet that holds the flap in place.  I have had to reattach the magnet multiple times in a day.  Without the magnet, the bag cannot be held by the handle making the entire bag pretty useless. Had I paid more I would probably have returned it.  But as the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for."""
2.0,"I bought the medium - usually wear a size small. I always go up a size with asian brands. The fit was spot-on! Also, the pattern and color (I bought yellow) are really cute.<br /><br />However, I had to return it. The strap on the right side was sewn on backwards! When I put it on, the white lining was showing on the strap. I wish mine wasn't faulty - because everything else about this is really great."
2.0,This dress is beautiful in person but it ran too small on me. There was also small white splotchy stains around the top and the bottom in the zipper was ripped. I was so sad because I loved this dress so much!! Order up a size
2.0,"It looks cheap, and feels cheap! I was pretty disappointed and never wear it!"
2.0,"Blue diamonds are so tiny there is no distinction between them and rhodium accents.  Also, the bar does not lay flat on neck, it rolls over so there is nothing to see anyway."
2.0,"They will work, but the back part of the heel on the inside isn't together. It didn't all get correctly gathered when the shoe must have been made."
2.0,If your not curvy or a junior this would be fine. Had to return it.
2.0,Not what I expected or a good price for the product.
2.0,"Beautiful but I received the purple elephant instead of the green. So I knocked off 3 stars for that, and I ordered 2. Both were purple and not green."
2.0,"This dress runs pretty small, which is disappointing. I gave it away because there was no way I could squeeze into it."
2.0,they would fit my greatnieces who are 10 and 12.
2.0,Easily snagged but cute costume. Fine for dress up
2.0,"The watch band was very cute, and I received a lot of compliments on it. However, after only a few weeks of wearing it, the little screws that hold the band to the watch just fell apart!"
2.0,"100% not a sweatshirt.  It also does not have the fuller sleeves with tighter cuff as pictured.  It is a long sleeve tee.  The stitching on the rainbow colors (top and bottom) show.  I ordered a medium ( i am typically a small-5’3”, 130lbs, bra 34C) and I’m glad I did.  I think a small would have been too tight, but I don’t like things snug.  I did keep it only because I needed a “rainbow” top, but due to poor quality, I don’t expect to get more wear from it.  If you are looking for a sweatshirt, sweater, or quality item,  this is not for you."
2.0,Only two collars were sent. Missing the 3rd.
2.0,"Bought from this company when I was in Canada and was very satisfied!! However this time around, the bands on two of the three pairs had kinks/deformities in them. They also fit slightly smaller than expected, despite having purchased the same size from them before."
2.0,"the ad said 4 colors: 2 shades of gray, navy and black-what I got was 3 black and one gray."
2.0,"I like the thought. But the width of the beanie is very small and tight. I got each of my three sons this for Xmas. Their ages are 11,13,15. None of them could comfortably wear the beanie as it was  VERY tight and constricting. Since they have tried them on-they have NEVER worn them. 🙁"
2.0,"These are TINY. I may have a large head but even on others the headband is still uncomfortably snug. Nobody likes a headache during exercise. The wristbands are also very tight on narrow wrists.<br /><br />These are cheap, and still not worth it."
2.0,The shirt it self is made okay. Nothing special.  But the collar on the shirt is not tall enough or heavy enough for the full band to stay standing up. The white full band is very very cheaply made and it only have one button in the back to keep it connected. For the price it ok but just okay.
2.0,"You get what you pay for - The pants are comfortable and have good pockets, the material is slick and doesn't feel bad but it is very cheaply made and appearance wise, these don't look great. Definitely not keeping them."
2.0,Wore it.  Cute.  Does not keep the correct time.
2.0,"Somewhat large in the leg openings, put it mildly.  Sits very strangely They say order one size up as this is Asian sizing.  I ordered L for a US medium.  Waist is fine, pouch OK, but leg openings....  The whole thing is just  not  that comfortable."
2.0,I could not get my mask yostay over it and unable to attach it even though it had 2 places to attach. Mask that I had wouldn't stay on.
2.0,"if your expecting a narrow legged pant like the one in the photo, forget it, its a wide leg cut."
2.0,"I am NOT a large person, so I'm not sure this belt would fit anybody over a size 4!  I normally wear a size 6-8 and this belt is so small it cuts off my circulation!  I can wear it but it makes my hips stick out more than normal because it cinches your waist so tight.  I would not recommend to anybody over a size 4."
2.0,"Well made, but shorter than the 8&#34; measurement that was stated.  I had to return it and one other that also claimed to be 8&#34; long.  Yes, I measured my wrist carefully, they are 7&#34; so I thought I would room to spare."
2.0,Sorry to say that I'm really disappointed. This necklace feels cheap and imitation. It doesn't even feel like silver? And the clincher is that the anchor is hollowed out on the backside. The color is off too so I'm completely questioning is there's even any silver actually here.
2.0,Are Blurry across Middle and top. Love the Look of them. The bottom is fine and clear for reading.  I Can't see clearly in middle or distance as way too Blurry. So may not be abke to wear even.  Disappointed for sure.
2.0,Received this shirt and it stunk of gasoline
2.0,No no no. I can button them at the waist but they are so tight on my butt if I bend over they will rip apart. They are made very odd and I ordered a 42 and the legs and butt feel like a 38. Way to tight in the butt and thighs but fit in the waist. Odd. I would not recommend these at all
2.0,These were shorter than expected and did not stay up.
2.0,Fit as expected but its awful. I really hoped it'd look different
2.0,One of the stones fell of the 2nd day!
2.0,Not strong enough for the magnet eyelashes
2.0,arrived with one of the arms not attached.  Found a screw to re-attach but didn't go so well.  I think the glasses would have been ok if they arrived intact.
2.0,"A KID'S WATCH !! - it looks nice but lacking in several aspects: lightweight (in design and materials - leather is very flimsy, nylon is super thin), too small to fit my (&#34;normal sized&#34;) wrist and totally lacking in quality.  Wish I knew which brand I ordered from Amazon several years ago - it was so much better!"
2.0,I liked it initially but it was nylon which wasn’t very soft.  My wrist got aggravated underneath my watch when I exercised:
2.0,"I'm a 12. Garment very tight.  I knew it was going to be too small I raised my arms to put it on.  Not one size fits all.  It was beautiful, colorful and just what I wanted, too bad."
2.0,"The material  for this is not worth  your money,  super thin  and a slippery  fabric."
2.0,"I ordered this April 16th. The zipper completely broke July 3rd. It's a shame, I like the bag; it is large and holds a ton of stuff. I got separate small bags (one for makeup, one for change, my wallet, my phone case...) to keep everything organized because it is just such a huge pocket inside. It could do with a separator. It does have two pouches and a zipper pocket on the inside. There are also two small zipper pockets on the outside which makes things more convenient. The handles are at a perfect length to sling over your shoulder. The problem is the zippers are made of that bronzy metal that gets hard to close, draws blood when it snags skin and inevitably breaks pretty quickly."
2.0,It’s a cardboard made wing not like the picture they don’t hold still so you have to hold them with ur hands if you want a good picture they come all folded
2.0,"Cheap material that fits and looks like a shapeless tent and took a while to get here. Punch four holes in an old fashioned Italian restaurant tablecloth and save yourself $20.Usually an extra large from China is too small; they think extra large is a woman who weighs 130 lbs. Unfortunately, some Chinese manufacturers have overcorrected, and here's the result."
2.0,"It did  not match the marketing picture,"
2.0,Was beautiful like the picture but has started to come apart after about five uses. Do not waste your money. The cheaper plastic capes last much longer.
2.0,"Not at all what it says- smaller in size, cheap and loose stitching. My fault for expecting something of quality to be delivered."
2.0,"Very poor quality, it came with 2 unsewn seams on sleeves..... very disappointed.<br />Waste of money...very cheap."
2.0,Order one size smaller then what you wear!
2.0,The rubber tip comes off the arm end making glass very uncomfortable. This is a really bad design! Aslo tight on your head and no way to stretch out.
2.0,"Shirt length is too short for me, and I'm a short person.  Sleeves don't hit my arms in a comfortable place, A 2x shirt is usually the correct fit but this one was too fitted.  Guess I will stick to the man's xl"
2.0,"I bought the White Sunflower dress and it was COMPLETELY see through- as in you can't even wear a cami/ under shirt under it because even that will show vividly.<br />I have bought other dresses from this brand though, and they are amazing. This review is solely about the white sunflower pattern!!<br /><br />They do tend to run a little large- consider the stretch and buy 1 size down!"
2.0,In the picture it shows box chain but I got very thin snake chain. May be because it is an add-on item and seller didn't care what they are shipping out.
2.0,I barely wore them once and it broke too easily
2.0,Its a very pretty top but even after taking my measurements to make sure it'd fit it fits tighter than I'd like it to be. The sleeves don't even puff out for it which is a shame. It runs small so if you consider buying I'd suggest you size up at least 2 sizes
2.0,"Bigger than I thought and after one wear, I accidentally snatched one out of my ear by adjusting my hair. One of the earrings came apart from the gold section."
2.0,The beads were small but nice unfortunately Ithe elastic bracelet was afraid in a couple of places I will need to get it fixed.
2.0,Based on the other reviews I ordered a large as I normally wear a medium in sweatshirts. This is huge! It easily comes down to my knees (I’m 5’1”). I thought it was a mistake because it’s so big but I went to look for a tag and there is no any. You can see that it has been cut out. Doesn’t sound like it is worth the hassle to return so I will give it to someone who it will fit better.
2.0,"These pants were disappointing. I purchased them for my daughter. First day she wore them the hem gave way by the end of the day. Since then I have had to re-stitch the hem on both pant legs, re-stitch the belt loops and re-stitch the side of the pant leg. If you aren’t accustomed to darning your own clothes I suggest you buy your pants elsewhere because they won’t last you a month. Not very sustainable."
2.0,This product is very large and just has 3 velcro closures so it doesn't stay on very well for a person in a wheelchair. They require additional stability closures so they don't fall off.
2.0,RINGS TOO SMALL I WEAR A SIZE 10
2.0,"These say for adult but they run small, I am a librarian at a school.  I read all day to students as I read it slips up my face because it's to small."
2.0,I got an XL to ensure it wouldn't be too snug of a fit (im usually a medium/large) and the XL seemed like it would fit someone that's between a size 14/18 depending on your build. It draped off of me as a size 10/12
2.0,I paid $63 for size 7 Ivory color. when other is only $39. Ok Fine! i really want a light color rain boots. When I open it SOOOOo Disappointed. it looks Dirty. see the photos. looks awful. not sure because it was returned or already dirty during the packing.
2.0,"Nice looking jacket, but they run really small! Not true to size at all."
2.0,Product description was misleading.  This cloth is not even likely to offer a good buffing to jewelry.  I'll probably keep them in my purse to clean sunglasses.
2.0,"The pants were well made, but had way too much cloth for my daughter's slim, size 2 frame.  The pockets stuck out and gave a very fat look."
2.0,"So far, the hoops with the little dangling things are okay. The smaller huggie hoops don’t clasp well and one of them doesn’t clasp at all so it just falls out of your ear."
2.0,"I wear an XL, I love the dress! Unfortunately, I gave it to my sister as it was too small, she wears a medium."
2.0,instructions unclear....measure from the inside of the buckle before cutting to size.
2.0,Most gloves seem to last forever. These started unraveling on both hands within a month
2.0,Nice material but sizing was off... way to small
2.0,I bought this to wear to a party this weekend. Arrived  as expected. Took it out to wash it cuz a lot of clothes I order off amazon have  bad smell to them and it seemed big. So I had I up to see it and it s HUGE. I got the purple color which is true to color in medium but I had to look at the the tag nd then AGAIN at the size chart to be sure it was in fact a medium don’t mind my run on sentences my iPad doesn’t have a backlight on the keyboard and I’m In bed idk what I’m gonna do yet. I planned on wearing this Saturday assuming it would look just like the photo I will prob exchange it for a small but from the reviews their HUGE too. I’m 150lbs five foot 3 so idk ugh!
2.0,It faded terribly after one wash. Love this style and have bought other products but this particular fabric did not last one wash!
2.0,the rise is too short...not for men with big bellies
2.0,The colors aren't as vibrant and it was more of a scoop neck than a v-neck. The material was also thin and flimsy and wrinkled very easily.
2.0,They are cute the stone was a little bigger then expected. But the post was not long enough to use as a lip ring.
2.0,"These are super cute, but the bow tie has been sewn on backwards on the one I recieved. The smaller bow is behind the bigger and it makes the bow flop forward a bit. How can I contact the seller about this?"
2.0,"I thought the face of the watch was very pretty.  However, the band was quite stiff making snapping it closed  quite difficult.  So much so that I had to return the item."
2.0,ALOT SMALLER than on size chart. Buy next size up.
2.0,"It was gorgeous and versatile while it lasted. I got to wear it maybe 4 times before the metal strand that holds the beads snapped in half, making the entire thing more or less useless. Would have given it 5 stats if it had lasted any reasonable length of time. Good thing it was cheap."
2.0,This shirt is the size of a child's shirt not a women's XL.  I tried to sent it back but the shipping is $10! I'll just find a kid to give away. Disappointed.
2.0,Not what I thought it would be but its ok
2.0,"Coin fit inside hoop nicely but first time I tightened the screw, it jammed and did not ever close tight enough to securely hold the coin."
2.0,It’s a soft material but I didn’t like it for me it’s not flattering at all. There are pockets with this dress. It does hit my knees as it says and very pretty color and it does have stretchness and you can make it smaller on you. I also didn’t like that you can see on the hanger it was super stretchy and it was sitting weird on my body.
2.0,"Looks nice, lacks ease of use, definitely RFID, it’s not for my needs, I gave it to my teen."
2.0,"The one thing you need to know about these boots is after you have them on for only about 15 min they will rub your leg, right above the ankle, pretty much raw. I was really disappointed because when you first put them on they were the most comfortable, of the three. But after just a short amount of time they hurt, badly. They were fur-lined and seemed warm. I hope you have better luck if you order them."
2.0,Itchy material....runs small...dont waiste money!!!
2.0,"brought for my ex,  it broke in like a month but i think it was his fault. cause he ain't wanna take it off"
2.0,The dress was too sheer and the top gaped open too much.
2.0,"Cute jacket, BUT very cheaply made. Buttons barely hanging on, no hole to push button through...Runs so large.<br />I'd stay away if I were you."
2.0,These slippers were adorable. I think they run small though because I got the size that's supposed to fit size 8 (I'm normally 7 to 8) and these were too small.  I did not exchange for the next size up because right out of the package I noticed the stitching at the end of the toe was coming off of the rubber sole. I have a problem with slippers not lasting a long time and to me this indicated they might not last. I ended up returning them for something else.
2.0,"My 10-year old's review: ""I received the wrong shirt! I received the Tokyo-H Sailor Moon Style Women T-Shirt Kawaii Cosplay Costume! They did offer me another one which is why I gave it 2 stars, but I didn't want to take the chance of getting the wrong shirt again. I would not recommend this shirt."""
2.0,"I love the idea of this wind resistant umbrella. The design is gorgeous. Finally, this winter, used the umbrella with all the rainfall we experienced( Southern California). To my dismay, the frame was falling apart, after the first windy/rainy day."
2.0,"The only reason I gave it a 2 star was because I thought it was going to be bigger vut otger than that it was sturdy, had a lot of little compartments and easy to assemble."
2.0,"Really uncomfortable. Very tight, short in length, ridged. Just awful. I returned immediately.  Didn't try to wear them outside."
2.0,"its cute, but made out of cheap materials. The wristband broke after only two months."
2.0,Not great quality the bow come detached
2.0,"Didn'fit as good as I would have liked , got some a frew years ago at TJ Max fit so much better..."
2.0,"It's a very cute bag, but the outside leather started peeling after owning it for 2 month.  I've only used it a total of 5 times, so very disappointed in the product as it's cheaply made."
2.0,"The workmanship seemed a liitle shabby.  The point where the leather meets the metal connector has a kink in it.  Might not be such  a terrible thing if if was on the other side of the Fitbit, but when you see it every time you look at your Fit it, well, it gets annoying..."
2.0,Did not like the t-shirt material
2.0,"Looks good for two days, then the gold colouring wears off. Good thing it's super cheap."
2.0,I paid double for this one compared to the amazon basic cube set. Used them at the same time. 2 of these already are falling apart. The basic ones still look as good as new. In my opinion this is not worth what you pay.
2.0,The links are easy to fall off and get lost
2.0,The colors were true to what is shown in the image. The fit was too large for me (normally wear XS or S) and ordered S.<br />The main issue was that the fabric was too thick and heavy for summer (especially the skirt). I live in a hot place and can imagine sweating buckets wearing this - therefore I returned it.
2.0,"I bought this for my girlfriend after she lost her navel ring. The picture looks far nicer than the actual item does. The item isn't horrible, but it certainly doesn't have the appeal that the picture does."
2.0,"These are only made for short women. I'm a little on the tall side, but just 5'8."" Also, they are supposed to work as dress pants, which usually means they should be a little longer to accommodate heals. Without shoes on, the hem of the pants floats comically a few inches above the floor. Also, as with other poorly tailored pants, the waistband is too large for the amount of stretch and for the size around the hips, so if you have anything resembling a waist or hips be ready for the world to have an extensive view of your underwear and/or butt as soon as you sit in these. They would just barely pass for dressy. They are comfortable so I'm adding one star for that."
2.0,Not well made. After 2 times wearing starting to come unstitched and lose buttons.
2.0,Dress is cute! Shipping was very slow! Takes up to much time to string the Back of dress up.
2.0,"Soft material, but 2 sizes small"
2.0,"I do like the bandana face mask. Unfortunately, it is far to small for an adult male head. The idea and quality of the item is great.  Just wish someone had used an adult to size the product."
2.0,"The earring WERE lovely. However, the fifth time I put them on the hook for the wire snapped off."
2.0,Loved it until it broke so easily.
2.0,"INCREDIBLY SMALL.  I ordered a size up, large, even though I am typically a small/medium. Couldn't even get the dress on!  Perhaps they meant ""childs""??? Disappointed, as I loved the dress."
2.0,"My son loves these. However, less than a month later, they are pulling apart with very light use (it's not been cold enough to need them much).  After I saw the split he told me, ""they came like that!"" That may or may not be true  - I just didn't notice til now.  Bummer!"
2.0,"I loved the item. It is beautiful and soft and... WOW. However, the sizing from the chart is way off. I ordered a 2XL and I measured it and it was 41 inches not 48 as shown. I hate leaving a bad review, but it isn't the product quality, that is spectacular, it is the sizing. It runs really small!"
2.0,"I have a 43"" chest. Ordered size Large. Can't even get my arm all the way in the sleeve, not even close to fitting correctly.<br /><br />Order at least two sizes bigger. Or just buy one that is better quality."
2.0,"It looks white in photo, definitely more cream colored."
2.0,This is cute but runs at least two sizes too small! Im sad because it’s really cute but tiny. I ordered a medium.
2.0,"These drawstring pants are not French terry. They are 100% polyester. The girl may find them too big, as the waist looks big. But, hopefully with the drawstring, she will be able to wear them."
2.0,"Product came looking like it got dropkicked by hurricane Katrina. Package open and wet almost through. Inside was a shirt I had to wash before wrapping, and it was poorer quality than 100 thread count sheets. I felt bad even gifting it to the intended, but it was one of the components of an outfit. Would have returned it, but due to shipping debacle, had to immediately wash. Oh well, just glad I didn't buy more than one."
2.0,The dress does not fit loosely like the picture but it is straight down tight fit. I bought my usual size and was quite unhappy with the unflattering look that it had. It is nothing like the picture.
2.0,I ordered an XL (my typical size) to wear as an outer layer during winter hiking in CO. It was very (very!) tight even without my other layers on. I think I would need to go 2 sizes up to meet my needs. This is unfortunate bc these aren’t easy to find at this price point. Returned.
2.0,"Fell of twice so far. Once at a public place at which I was fortunate enough to reclaim the next day. This was only day 2 of owning  it. Second was at home. Clearly it is more rigid than the original and is susceptible to interference with cold-weather clothing (long-sleeve leather jacket, in my case). Good thing it was a cheap tracker to begin with, and I have an alternate back-up, but it is quite annoying to deal with cheap product. oh, well."
2.0,"These are brown, not orange :( however they will still work as we purchased them for a Halloween costume and only planned on our little guy wearing them for that purpose."
2.0,"there was no modeling of the earrings, so I was surprised they were so tiny."
2.0,"This dress serves better as a beach cover up. In addition, the material is flimsy and the dress did not reach the floor."
2.0,This was for my wife who said If it was made with a cotton/poly blend it would have been ok to wear in public. Liked the idea of a built in bra.
2.0,Just didn’t like this dress on my body shape. Not flattering for larger chests.
2.0,Pretty thing that ends up being a useless piece of junk which will damage your expensive timepieces because it comes apart and then your watch flies off and hits the ground and there's no way to fix that it happens over and over and over you just have no recourse except to purchase this item everybody do not purchase this item
2.0,It’s thin
2.0,The fit is weird. My daughter didn’t like it. Colors are fun and bright.
2.0,Did not fit. Too short on torso
2.0,"Greetings...<br />I say it is Ok because even though feels wells, It started to &#34;pell off&#34; after just wearing them once. Saying that I just used to go for a walk with no reason to deteriorate.<br />One image shows how it came.. the other image shows how part of the fabric started to peel off after just wearing once"
2.0,The pants were quite baggy/ saggy in the waist and butt. I hate the bottoms. They do not tie in a cute way like the picture. They are awkward and ridiculous. They look like pirate pants. For a pirate costume. I tried to return them but shipper said that it's too expensive to return. I donated the pants. Not happy.
2.0,"i have a normal size head; the hat is very small.  It is adjustable but it is just weird that I am on the last notch, very weird and I think it looks weird on"
2.0,A bit disappointed it’s very tight but also the material is itchy inside.
2.0,The top is super small my burst is a lot bigger than that.
2.0,Did not fit me well and it came in late.
2.0,Picked after first wash
2.0,It’s just a regular t-shirt looks nothing like the pictures
2.0,"Material was very thin, scratchy and see through. Bought a large for my daughter and it was very snug. Asked for a refund within an hour of receiving. Seller replied within 24 hours and offered a $5 refund (we purchased for $17)<br />I rejected refund amount because we would still be out $12 on a pullover she would never wear.<br />Seller responded a second time 24 hours later and closed the refund inquiry because they said Amazon only gives them 48 hours to settle matters.<br />They then offered a $9 refund, which still left me out $8. They told us to keep item, so I guess we will try to gift it so it doesn’t go to waste."
2.0,One of the rings snapped in half on the way to me.  This seems to look like plastic when I looked at the center.  I question the description of this being a Silver set of rings.
2.0,Doesn't keep a charge for more than 2 weeks.  Price is to high for this battery.
2.0,Arms are to tight..
2.0,Unfortunately this item’s sizing cannot be trusted. I bought 10 year old size and it was too small for even an eight year old. China sizing much different from USA.
2.0,It was not made very well. The stitching between the top and skirt looked very cheap. But the fabric and colors were great
2.0,Its beautiful but way too big
2.0,I saw that these ran small so I ordered a size larger than I usually wear. (I'm 5'6 and 150lbs. I have wide hips) Not remotely close to being a) tall enough for me or b) large enough.
2.0,"Buckle spring bar ejected somehow on a walk and the clasp lost one of it's parts. Unfortunately, this happened just outside of the warranty but it had only been used for a few weeks as I have others that I switch with frequently. I did like it. I wonder if I can find a way to contact ANCOOL for the one part I need."
2.0,The socks were advertised for ease  of putting on feet. They are too difficult to get on!  Our podiatrist added that they were too tight and she had very hard time pulling up on feet. Wearer had to have socks immediately removed due to pain.  Too tight and too hard to get on and off.
2.0,"The zipper is not on the back. The one they send me ,has the zipper on the side. Material does not look like the picture"
2.0,"First off when I opened the package the nightshirt smelled like cigarette smoke. When I pulled it out and tried it on it was wrinkled, too large and see through! Was extremely disappointed and had to return."
2.0,"I love the Sunflowers, however it didn't stretch out AT ALL. I wish it had, because I love sunflowers.  Now I simply have wrapped around my gear shifter in my car."
2.0,I bought these for an 8 yr. old girl and I think they are way too small for her.  The picture of the woman/girl wearing the earrings is deceiving.
2.0,"Way smaller than expected for One Size. I followed the chart, and I’m usually a medium in asian sizes. This is uncomfortably tight and barely made it over my butt. The material is scratchy and not flexible at all."
2.0,"Pros: Good feel on the leather and color<br />Cons: Bad sizes, runs way too big. My normal shoe size is 9, last Babolat shoe i wore a 8.5, so i thought this would also fit me in the 8.5, but it came out bigger than expected. Also too heavy compare to the other Babolat shoe, and it hurts my achiles tendon."
2.0,"The left lens of the silver pair is significantly weaker than the right lens. I thought maybe it was a problem of pupillary distance or one lens sitting closer to my eye than the other one, gave myself headaches for almost two weeks trying to adjust either the glasses or my vision, but it's just the lens -- they don't match. The gold pair is fine and I like them -- they're sturdy, they don't slide down, they're comfortable, and they don't scratch if I cheat and clean them with my t-shirt."
2.0,"Not happy, way to big in the waist. I wear a large size top and a smaller bottom. Not happy with this dress."
2.0,"Material is important, get a size larger"
2.0,The pants aren’t like tights material as they appear in the picture. Picture was misleading but I should have done my research.
2.0,Hard to breath in it and made me hot.
2.0,i bought this for my daughter as a gift and she wore it for 2 days and the clasp broke she was very upset
2.0,"These tights fit pretty strangely. I'm 5'3&#34;, 125 lbs, with wider hips/butt. I usually order a size medium in tights so they can fit around my hips and waist and not feel restricting. These were SUPER tight around the legs, butt, and waist, however, for some reason they were really big in the crotch area and it kept bunching. They also do not stay up well so I had to keep pulling them up every few minutes. The material itself is nice, but that's pretty much it. Ended up just tossing them since they were only $10 and not really worth the hassle of a return."
2.0,"It has the same edges of the ""Front man"" but it is just glossy plastic, not the muted carbon fiber black. Lots of fried glue inside from where they glued the fabric in for the eyes. Looks like a standard mold without much care of it final look. I'm not going to return since price was so low but next time I would spend more for better quality.<br /><br />I did not contact seller, did not make a complaint. I will work with what I have and see if I can fix it myself."
2.0,I like that the bag looked exactly as pictured<br />But came with a big tear inside.
2.0,They look ok. I followed the instructions and they fit. However the silver started to chip off on the upper piece exposing the copper looking metal underneath. Used it for 2 hrs. on Halloween and it started to flake. Got home and through them away. You decide if the expense is worth for using it for one time only. I don't think it was worth the cost.
2.0,Ordered this in a small base of the size chart provided. Did not fit at all. Also this is not steel boned in any way shape or form. Disappointed.
2.0,"A little on the small side, but not horrible, mostly just a little snug for my muscled thighs.  The major issue though is the fastening, which is a single button, somewhat loosely attached, without internal reenforcement.  You can fix that easily enough but the pockets, while numerous are sall, not 'cargo' pockets in any way.  For some reason, they are also bizarrely angled, which prevents me from getting my hand all the way into them.  There is no way I can carry a stethoscope or even my pulse oxymeter. The fabric is great, but unless I can carry a couple of instruments, what good are they?"
2.0,This product runs at least three sizes too small. There is no stretch whatsoever.
2.0,Pretty but the backs are too loose.
2.0,I love it but it is too large for me.  The quality is great.  I just got the wrong size for my body.
2.0,Very strong plasticy smell. The kids did not want to wear them at all.
2.0,the necklace isnt that pretty and measured longer than stated ( wanted a choker style necklace)
2.0,This was not made for big chested women.
2.0,Nice shirts. I always get a large but these are too tight and too short for me unfortunately.
2.0,The pants are too large on the bottom around the calves.  The tuxedo strip was too large
2.0,"This shirt is just ok. It fits very small, so order 2-3 sizes up from normal. Overall it is cute, but I had to give it to my daughter because it was a little too small."
2.0,I’m tall but this was super shirt waisted
2.0,Not for short girls or skinny minis gave it my sister looks amazing on her catwalk worthy...must have curves WAHHH
2.0,"FYI, these are NOT Terry cloth. The material was just plain old flat polyester. And the gray is much lighter than what's pictured here."
2.0,broke apart
2.0,"Purchased XL large , but they shrunk to XS.  Not happy, but my 9 yo daughter loves them."
2.0,"This watch band is a 20 mm curved end band but, don't expect it to look nice on a Seiko SSC017. The watch case and the curved ends are at two totally different mismatched heights. The spring pins that were supplied were far too long...........I'm thinking they were for a 22 mm watch. It was a real chore to attach it to my watch then, it was not aligned correctly. I ended up opting to order an OEM from totalwatchrepair.com  part# MOES327J9. I not return this band because it will cost almost as much to ship it back. But, I can not say that I recommend purchasing it either."
2.0,"Cute pattern & stretchy however the material<br />is definitely cheap, theseams were already coming apart when I received them and they are very see thru"
2.0,"Looked great, fit as expected. However, one shoe quit working after 2 weeks, not constructed well enough for active kids"
2.0,"I wear a true 10, but these shoes fit at least one size smaller. The color and design are nice, but the fit is not what it should be. Definitely buy a size bigger than what you normally wear."
2.0,This dress had a weird seam under the chest area. It was super noticeable and made the whole dress awkward.
2.0,"The large is no where near a large. If you are busty, don't bother. Cute style but wish the specs were correct"
2.0,"Customer service was great when we had to replace the first helmet due to a crooked visor. Unfortunately the second one broke halfway through Halloween while we were trick-or-treating. I think the product looks great, but it shouldn’t be more than $5 for the quality."
2.0,"PROS:<br />- Slimming perfect fit.<br />- Beautiful front twist as pictured.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Too pricey for the Low quality, slightly see-through material.<br />- Material is neither soft nor comfortable.<br />- The left and right tips of the V-neck don't lay down on your chest as pictured on the model - they protrude out and bend over revealing the inward seam. I'm not pleased with this dress and would definitely not recommend it to anyone."
2.0,"Nice colors and pattern, good stretch. Cheaper quality of fabric. Unfortunately the fit is made for a figure with zero curves. It feels like the manufacturer skimped on fabric. Sadly i realized that after i washed the set."
2.0,Medium too small large too big
2.0,"Too small! Tedious to put together. Once put together, some had to be reinforced with tape or hot glue.<br />Way too worksy !!!!! WAY too small!!!!"
2.0,The gold flaking is extremely different between the two. Great quality otherwise.
2.0,It's cool but you must replace the piece holding the dog tag to the necklace because it comes apart almost immediately.
2.0,Keeps getting stuck and is impossible to take off. It looks great but if my hubby is getting stuck in his belt and we both cant get him out... there's something seriously wrong here.
2.0,I have bought other shirts from the seller and 2 I really like but this one didn't fit the same. it was smaller than expected. So disappointed in this purchase.
2.0,"2 piercings are missing the barbell, and piercing are really small and tiny."
2.0,"Color not as pictured. They are actually a dull dark green, not the bright green pictured. They also seem larger than the picture shows. I am returning."
2.0,Not a quality suit
2.0,They are not oversized like the ad and pictures on the ad. Disappointed to say the least.
2.0,"The only reason for my dislike is that the locket opens and I lost all my charms.  So, now I have reordered all the charms I lost."
2.0,This shoe is heavy and the straps are loose. I got blisters after 4 hours. ☹️
2.0,"Disappointed. Fabric is soft and the color is good. However, the fabric is thin and you can see through it. Seamless underwear, yes you can see. Light through the legs, yes you can see. I was hoping to wear this out but it’s going to serve as a bathing suit cover for pool and beach time. If you don’t mind not keeping anything to the imagination then buy. I’m sure some people will really enjoy!"
2.0,"When I first got this bag, I was excited.  It fit my lifestyle very well.  The pockets were the right size in the right places.  The grey canvas was exactly what I was looking for.  Within two weeks, the lining of the outer zipper pocket had torn across the entire bottom.  A week later, the inner lining tore.  Disappointing."
2.0,"I thought I was purchasing a dress, not a jacket."
2.0,"I bought this because I loved the harry potter bracelet, however as soon as I got it the chain broke. I can still wear it with some tweaking I had to do myself and it's very cute, but very cheaply made"
2.0,Like the shirt but the largest size was too tight.
2.0,One rivet fell off on the decorative piece that the tab slips under on week #1.  Week #2-the 2nd rivet fell off.  My fault I should have sent  it back.<br /><br />Otherwise I really loved everything else about the purse.
2.0,"Junk. The post was glued on askew.<br />Larger than they appear, FYI"
2.0,I ordered this for my husband in burgundy but it came in black and wasn't well fitting on his head.
2.0,"I was so excited to get this ring because it is so beautiful in the pics and there were so many good reviews. It shipped very quickly but when I opened the ring box the metal of the band was very bright and the metal of the ring was a yellow color so they did not match at all and it was way too obvious to just ignore it and wear it anyway! I don't know if I just happened to get a crappy ring but I will not be exchanging, just returning, because I do not want to go through more hassle if I got another yellow ring."
2.0,Don’t love this. The red color is very off from the photo. The photo is a pretty burnt red and what I got is bright fire engine red. The photo looks like a smooth frabric but sections are textured
2.0,"At such an inexpensive price I really can't be too critical. I bought this to use as a cheap cover up for a beach trip. As soon as I started sweating a little under the arms & a little under my breasts (long before I even got wet from the beach or pool) the color started running off. Thankfully I was able to get it out of my swim suit, but nonetheless an inconvenience. Also, as many of the others have commented it is very sheer."
2.0,Broke after a few uses
2.0,Fit as expected but I don't like the quality of these socks. So cheap quality. Do not recommend to buy.
2.0,Did not fit as expected. Bottoms are not high wasted. My daughter said she looked like she was wearing a diaper. The top is not as long as shown and the breast cup pads are hot pink which I'm expecting will show when the top is wet.
2.0,Not that warm and the touch function is pretty poor. I almost always have to take the gloves off.
2.0,This ring was very pretty but scratched WAYYY too quickly and with everyday use snapped in 3 weeks from purchase. Material is very cheap.
2.0,I like but it come with the pices to attach to my watch
2.0,There was a hole in the seam of my dress. Other than that it was nice for the price. Just be ready to sew your own dress.
2.0,"The band continually came unhooked from the watch. I almost lost my watch twice, and finally said ""screw it"" and went back to the one that came with the watch."
2.0,Runs small. I know I'm a size 7 (via my engagement ring measurement) but this was very tight. Returned. Disappointed size up was not offered via Prime.
2.0,"The jacket is way too big, and the pants aren't big enough.  I knew the jacket would be a little big, because I ordered a larger size to make sure the pants would be big enough.  The jacket will still work, as I can wear it over my heavy coat for winter riding, but there isn't enough velcro on the sleeves, so you can't really tighten them up around the wrist.  The pants are just worthless.  I'm a big guy with a big ass and big thighs, so I knew I would need to order a larger size to fit.  Even with ordering 2 sizes over what the sizing chart says I should order, they are still too small."
2.0,Didn’t work for glare. Just made everything yellow. They are made well for the price and the case is nice to have
2.0,To small and see thru!
2.0,The top part near the neck falls and it's not like the one shown in the picture neither the dress material is like the picture.
2.0,Doesn't stay in correct position on the ear.  It's very cute though.  We use it as a tack on the bulletin board.
2.0,"The reviews of this cover-up said it was too long -- some women wrote that it went to the ground.  Instead, mine was very short.  Not a cover up at all except for my arms.  Seemed flimsy.  Disappointed."
2.0,"Do NOT trust the size chart. According to the size chart, this skirt should have been a little bit too big for me, but everyone said to buy a size up, so I did. This skirt was so small, it wouldn't fit over my thighs. I almost think it's kids sizes, even though it's advertised as womens. I can't wait to lose 50 lbs to fit into this skirt. Keeping it just for motivation."
2.0,"The buttons are oddly placed way off-center. Comfortable to wear around the house, but wouldn't go outside with it."
2.0,This product did not meet my expectations. It left a film on my lenses that defeated its purpose. I do not recommend it.
2.0,Battery goes dead so fast. 2-3 weeks most on 4 AA batteries
2.0,"The black cushiony bits which sit on the ears fell off almost immediately on both of the pairs we purchased. The frames were nice looking but the lenses were also too easily popped out. The age range says for 3 year olds but at the price these go for, I would not recommend them for kids under 5 and if you get them be prepared to glue the cushions on."
2.0,Did have yellow as the picture and I purchased one more box with my concerns of getting yellow. Still I didn’t get a lot of colors.
2.0,"These fit really well, were nice & comfy but unsure about the quality. They were ripped after just one wear and it wasn’t because they were too small or didn’t fit."
2.0,Like wearing a large thin scarf. Not worth  it.
2.0,"Unfortunately, it was nothing special.:/"
2.0,"The hat in the picture seems sturdy all around, holding its weight like a champ. The hat I got is so floppy it’s sad."
2.0,Color as pictured. Runs way smaller- 2 sizes smaller than described. It fit me and it does look beautiful on.
2.0,"I actually like the look of the dress and the fabric,  Very small.  I wear a 2X.  The dress I received would not fit a large."
2.0,This dress is poorly made.  The neckline is out of line and I could not figure out the creases and lines on it.
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress because I felt the material (the star pattern) was quite whimsical.  Unfortunately, I feel quite dowdy in it.  The cut isn't flattering at all.  I have decided to couple it with a wide burgundy belt, a bulky burgundy/cranberry colored necklace, and wine/burgundy boots.  I hope it creates a little more flair.  That said, this dress is perfectly acceptable, but it just wasn't my best choice."
2.0,It’s nuce but kinda cheap
2.0,The color is wrong. The khaki is more of a blush pink.
2.0,"I ordered this in blue and black. the blue fits an adult the black fits a child. dimensions should be included in description. i initially though the black i received was defective, so i returned it and ordered another. same results could not pull it over my head!!"
2.0,I've worn it 3 days and it's already falling apart it's cheap material.
2.0,"Made in China......I got to quit buying that kind of stuff. These LOOK just like the picture. They're about a size too small. They smell like formaldehyde, and feel like they're made out of cardboard. Seriously, they feel like paper shoes. I'm afraid to get these things wet. They might disintegrate. I gave them 2 stars because they do look like the picture."
2.0,"I realize this is slim fitting, but the material is very flimsy."
2.0,"Way too small. It's very cute, but thin fabric order up by 2-3 sizes"
2.0,Very see-through
2.0,"Colour Bled all over my white quit while ironed Right after receiving!! It came fully wrinkled. Fabric is sooo static! It sticks all over the body. It also came ripped in one place. However, Medium fits well for my size. I am 5'2&#34; 56 kg with 36C bust."
2.0,"I could even pull it on, and I am just 90 lbs."
2.0,I was looking forward to letting my daughter wear this then I noticed right away a small hole in the fabric right in the front.
2.0,"This watch is not clear.  It is white.  I wanted a clear silicone watch for my daughter.  I searched everywhere for a clear one.  The descriptions states clear, but it is not clear."
2.0,Cute pattern and style but sizing is way off!
2.0,The glasses broke at the end of the ear piece by the little hole. I loved them and was very disappointed.
2.0,I don't know  why I order from manufacturers  that have asian sizing.  It never fits right. Sad.
2.0,The shorts have no cinch waste. they are way wide in the waist they would fall off my son's but .cheap  denim
2.0,it is slippery and not suitable for the purpose bought. I bought it for use on wood floor so that I won't slip and fall and it does not provide the stability. Size fits.
2.0,This sheds too much!!
2.0,"I really like the fit and look of the shirt but it split along the shoulder seam after the 2nd wash, maybe it was just bad luck but Id say only buy if you're willing to chance it."
2.0,"The shirt is very cute and I personally feel that it is great quality.<br />My issue is that it is too small. I normally wear a large, or an XL if i'm going for the oversized look.<br />Because I noticed that it stated &#34;Our Size is Asian Size,So Pick 1 Size Up than you usually Wear!!&#34; I decided to go w/ an XXL and it didn't fit at all."
2.0,"It’s cute and a great piece to match clothing in, I’m five feet and although it is a bodycon I don’t think it’s small, bodycons are supposed to be snug and fitting, this fits me as I expect it to. The issue I have is this is $16 but it’s super thin material and doesn’t feel at all durable, this is nearly sheer and for someone who is curvier this doesn’t do much for me. I purchased the all black and I can see my panties through the back. I could probably find something similar at a forever 21 tier for like $5. It’s a cute piece but I don’t think it’s worth $16 for sheer material that is comparable to a pair sheer tights."
2.0,It's way too small to be a tote. Has the definition of 'Tote bag' changed? because i thought totes were supposed to be larger. This is tiny!!!
2.0,"The color was beautiful, and it fit great. Somehow it gets really stiff and heavy when wet, which is odd for a swim suit cover up, but it's light and airy when dry. It also takes a long time to air dry, which is all I did with it out of fear the dryer would ruin it. I feel like a swim suit cover up should dry quickly, since logically it's going to get wet when you put it on after a swim. The biggest issue was that it ripped the first time I wore it, right at the seam in the armpit. It's not too small - I got it loose so I had plenty of room to move. I guess the wet material stuck to my body, and when I moved it ripped because the material is so cheap. I know I bought a cheap cover up, and I just needed it for 1 week at the beach, but was really disappointed it didn't even make it through one day. I still ended up wearing it because it was all I had, and it still did the job."
2.0,"A SIZE 4T product had very little stretch and could hardly go over the head of a 32lb, 3 years and 6mth old Girl's head.<br />Material was not as soft as I expected and the fit was small because of the lack of stretch.....I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!"
2.0,Slides right off seat big or small
2.0,These broke within a week. The back fell completely off without it being dropped or anything. Disappointed.
2.0,"I have gotten a nicer swimsuit from Cocoship before that I absolutely love. This one... not so much. The quality is okay for the price. The boob cups are massive and stiff if you have an average sized chest like I do. Always size up with this brand. The bottom of the suit flared out and grabbed my stomach in an unflattering way. Overall the suit wasn't flattering and I am hesitant to buy another in this shape.<br /><br />My measurements are as follows and I got a size 2XL. 190 pounds, 5'5, 38C, usually wear a L."
2.0,The top looks awfull unless you have big boobs. The bottoms run small. Couldn’t even wear this.
2.0,I would not buy these again they don't last. While packing for a trip I put the small bottles in zipped everything up and the zipper ripped. The old plastic zip lock storage bags work better.
2.0,"These look and feel cheap. The lenses do darken slightly in the sun, but not nearly enough to keep from squinting. They don't help at night at all."
2.0,Hate the fit….sorry
2.0,Fabric quality was not very good so it does not picture arms snuggling.
2.0,"Really awkward cut, at least for my body. I am 5’9’’ and a medium 6-8 usually fits great. This dress, not so much. It is really short. It is too big in the torso and too small in the hips. It just doesn’t hang right. If you are cut really straight this might work, but if you have a curvy/hourglass shape this is not the dress for you."
2.0,"I actually REALLY like this vest. Beautiful fabric, well made, and it fits as it should with the exception of the collar which is SOOOO big. Because of that, it hangs weird and it makes me look frumpy. It’s really too bad"
2.0,"These shorts are super cute. I had a pink pair for several months when suddenly the elastic waistband snapped and they were completely unwearable. No big deal, I thought, I'll just go grab another pair because it's cheap and convenient. Well I ordered a pair in black, and I also loved how they looked, but the elastic snapped five days later, on their third wear.<br /><br />Cheap clothes are cheap."
2.0,No don tan calientes
2.0,Beautiful design but not necessarily sized to fit American Women.
2.0,These are a great idea for working out but don't seem super durable. All of them broke after about a month of wearing them.
2.0,Product broke after 3 months of use.
2.0,Cute but the material reminds me of a cheap costume
2.0,It's soft alright & dainty..Too small for me..enough room maybe for a cellphone & coin bag. Anymore the strap may break.
2.0,cheaply made -- returned
2.0,Runs super big
2.0,Nice for everyday on the go wear. Love the colors. Run very slim suggest 1 size bigger when ordering.
2.0,Only wore a pair twice before the seam came open at the toe. Super cute and comfortable just wish they lasted longer. Not use to paying $4+ for sock that last through 2 wearings.
2.0,I typically wear 2x and ordered a 3x because I wanted it to be baggy and snuggly. It was a little but not nearly as much as I would have assumed being 1 whole size bigger. It is soft and warm. Concerned with quality being that the picture I attached shows all the hemming string that needed to be cut straight out of the package before it was even worn. We shall see how it goes. At this price I didnt mind keeping it and trying it out.
2.0,The gaiter is a bit tight for an eight year old. The ear loops are just holes in the material do not super comfortable. The kiddo much prefers one that has actual loops and isn’t as tight over his mouth.
2.0,"No I thought it would be bigger, plus I am still waiting for refund. I was changed twice for it on March 6 and March 9th. For over $300 I thought it would be a bigger carrot!"
2.0,"man, i love the colors of this and i want to keep it. the art is from a poster my sister had in the 80's. unfortunately the fit is awkward, leaving no give/stretch and fit the chest and hips too tight while baggy on the waist. the inside of the material feels nice, but the non-stretching material is leading me to return it unfortunately. :( i really wanted to keep this item too. oh and the sleeves are short. i'm not sure who this is meant for, I am 5'8&#34; but i don't have excessively long arms. it's just awkward, but i guess i expected it and wanted to try it anyway. i am paying for the return shipping now."
2.0,It’s nice for the price but it does lose time in a day.
2.0,help me to return this item.  too small
2.0,"Earrings are very pretty, but heavy for me."
2.0,"This dress was not what I expected.  The material on the collar, cuffs and skirt is 'thick and heavy'.  The lace is pretty, the color is pretty - I got Navy - but it didn't fit well at all.  I read lots of reviews and even looked at pictures and thought this would work for me, but no.  After seeing it - I wasn't sure I would even try it on.  The material looks/feels like (and this sounds really bad) but kinda like drapes - slicky, kinda shiny and heavy.. I did try it on and acknowledge it looks better on, the material didn't look like I wrapped up in a curtain - but not only was it WAY too big,  the fit itself was not good for me. I loved the lace and the top of the dress - but the bottom just didn't have any appeal.<br />I see why so many people bought petticoats to wear under it - because that is the feel/style for this dress. It has the flare (hence, the 1950s style)."
2.0,"Igual a la foto. No me parece buen material, la talla es algo pequeña."
2.0,"Really still and dull, not my kinda necklace I guess."
2.0,The size was too small.
2.0,I am so upset this dress was too small! It was gorgeous!
2.0,"This was tight on my 14 year old sons hand. He’s not a large boy, but actually a skinny guy. This cut off circulation to his hand and fingers. And it’s some sort of cheap metal and turned his hand green. I don’t recommend this."
2.0,I’ll be sending this back. It’s a cute idea but material is super thin. Does not fit like pic. Wearing off shoulder just looked silly and baggy.
2.0,not as I expected - reminds me not to order on-line
2.0,I ordered 2XL and it fit like a large
2.0,"First, the earrings are very small.  If you are a petite person they might work for you.  Also, I thought from the picture they would be shiny.  Instead it is a brushed metal.  I could live with that, but the size is my problem with them."
2.0,"It's on the smaller side for hats. After I adjusted the snapback, it feels like it will fall off my head. I have a big head though and normally have this problem with average or OSFA hats. The hat itself has an odd shape. It not half a sphere like a regular hat. It's more like a yamaka, hugging your scalp but falling off. The quality of the sewing was poor as well. There was lots of loose threads and the stitching was definitely not a straight line. More like a trail of drunk ants walking across a picnic table. The meshing itself was also very stiff making it very uncomfortable to break in. If it was the right size, I probably wouldn't have had a problem with it though."
2.0,"The socks are fine, but the size was totally off from the description.  I thought I was ordering girls socks and these are sized for a woman.  What I received was for shoe size 8-9.5 in women's shoes, not for girls.  They fit me and not my daughter."
2.0,This is not a good tummy control shapewear. The fabric feels very cheap and extremely flimsy to give any control. Sorry didn't work for me and had to return this immediately
2.0,I felt like this would stretch my earring hole.  The hook is a flat shape rather than round.  It was hard to even get through the hole.  They are cute though.
2.0,Wasn't overly impressed with the fit of the dress. Was longer than I'd hoped. The sleeves are scratchy and the dress has a chemical odor. Returning it.
2.0,"I was so happy when I brought this purse back in 2017 of May. I needed a crossbody and thought I found the perfect one. I wore this purse sparing since I have many purses, so I would store it away. I had purchased a few MK purses so I have the satin bags to store them in when not used. I put this purse up at the beginning of 2018 took it out to use a few times for the spring and stored it away for the summer months. Used it a few more times before the winter then stored it away. Now remind you I have the Micheal Kors bag and PLUS I had purchased the Micheal Kors leather cleaner & Conditioner to put only on the leather the day before I stored my purse. Today I take my purse out 2019 March and I see that the chain is changing colors it is fading!!!...  I am so upset. The reason I don't mind paying more money on purses is that the care that I give them and storing them in the bags in a well-conditioned room. I did not expect to see this happen. I have brought cheaper purses and they have outlasted this more expensive one. The pics don't even show all the damage on the chain and gold on the purse but it is much. The MK purse chain I brought separate and it also changed. Now I do have a black and gold studded Hamilton purse and I had that one going on 4 years maybe 5 and it looks new. No change at all and it has gold chains... Has this happened to anyone else?"
2.0,"Not really liking these, only got them cause my son loves them. The box they came in was way too small which wouldn’t be a problem except it bent the wings. Looks tacky now. Would not recommend these."
2.0,I purchased this beautiful chain. And I wore it 4 days and the necklace broke right at the part that holds it together.  Kinda disappointed but I'll be repurchasing soon.
2.0,Is not what I wanted. Will use it.
2.0,"I ordered the caramel and the blue on the bottom is actually purple. Ordered a size up bc I wanted it be a little roomy but sleeves are way too wide, especially opening."
2.0,"its ok, I wear it when its chilly and i dont want a jacket but, it feels cheap and it runs small."
2.0,Pretty goofy Locs. Sort of look like geriatric goggles
2.0,"This is a very cute shirt, but I ordered a 2X and it is closer to a medium."
2.0,It meant for people with large calves.  Could. It get them on. The friend I gave them to Bart was able to get them on and they left elastic marks because they were so tight.
2.0,"I never write reviews, but I would have liked to read an honest one before ordering these. Product is fairly thin. Sizing is off. Ordered a large kids. I got a small shirt with medium pants, the pants match up to a U.S. kids large. I bought a total of 5 outfits and ended up mix and matching sets to make it ""work""."
2.0,Parecen las prendas que vende Costco
2.0,This item does not fit on the arm of the frames.  Will slide off every time.  There is an adjustment spring but it will not work because it does not stay tight and firm.  Does not serve the purpose.  I am returning it.
2.0,"Pretty nice quality but sizing is off. I usually wear a size 6-8 swimsuit, I ordered the large and it's actually too short to get on."
2.0,It makes noise as it winds.
2.0,It is see through. I picked 2 sizes up and it's still small.
2.0,This has a head circumference of 23&#34;. It fits my adult head and not my child's at all.
2.0,Weird fit. I’m bottom heavy but there were so long and narrow and not a comfortable material
2.0,I have several Brighton pieces and I love them.  The gold coloring on this piece is bright yellow and they crystals were not set straight.  Not their usual quality for the price.
2.0,"I received this necklace in the mail and was so excited. It was exactly the look I was going for. The first time I wore it, within an hour of putting it on, a bead fell off. Upon further inspection, I noticed there are several more beads not attached properly just waiting to fall off too. This is a beautiful piece of jewelry but poor quality. It was inexpensive so I didn't expect the best quality, however it shouldn't have fallen apart that quickly. Not impressed."
2.0,The look was not as pretty as in the picture and these are long and when I tilt my head a bit they poke in my shoulder.
2.0,not attractive
2.0,Thinner than I thought.
2.0,This isn’t the necklace in picture although it’s pretty nice.  It’s just not what was advertised and it’s from Thailand?
2.0,Cute shirt...not sweatshirt material...just polyester....RIDICULOUSLY LONG SLEEVES! It's a good thing I know how to sew!
2.0,"poor quality to magnetic claps , falls off very easily. thin  metal"
2.0,These have a hole in the bottom center and that ruined it for me. I didn’t return them but I should have.
2.0,Its too big😞
2.0,Were made cheap and they weren't worth the price so I sent them back.  Watch those hidden charge fees they will get you! I won't be ordering anymore.
2.0,Dress is very see threw no under lining what so ever and straps were way to long with no way to adjust
2.0,I chose the size based on the measurements on the size chart. I could have sized down. The lace around the arms looks cheap. Super disappointed by this. I really wanted it to work!
2.0,Lens fell out just after a few days. Will not buy again
2.0,"I just received this shirt 3 days ago and was dissappointed. It’s very clingy and itchy even after washing it. The material is soft which is great, it’s just itchy. It’s also not long sleeve it’s a half sleeve and the grey is much lighter in person than in the picture."
2.0,"Very short and small. Not the loose, slouchy shirt I was expecting from the picture."
2.0,"Dress did not look like the typical Lauren Ralph Lauren quality. I have several LRL gowns including a blue one like the one I ordered (different style). They are elegant, good quality with a great fit. This gown did not seem to compare. I am returning it with my Amazon Prime and I have to pay $4.85 plus tax. Had I known I would not have ordered the dress."
2.0,"These boots look very nice, but they are way too heavy!<br />Come on, designers, can't you come up with the 21st Century boot:<br />soft, strong, light-weight, and beautiful?"
2.0,I bought a larger size but it still would fit.  There is no flexibility to the fabric.  It's either the right fit or not at all.  The material is stiff and won't stretch if you gain weight.
2.0,"Ordered too small, hurts ear"
2.0,To small. I’d size up. The color was way to bright and see through. Not my style.
2.0,Makes ur booty look flat :/
2.0,Very thin material you need a cover up as soon as you get out of the water. Love the straps.
2.0,Very light duty.  Break easily.
2.0,The face was much larger than it looked. I like the style and the mesh band held on by a magnet. It was inexpensive but it cost me $11.40 to return it in the box it was sent in. That was almost 1/2 the cost of it. That won't happen again to me because I will watch the info better.
2.0,"The skirt is very cute and fits as expected, unfortunately the fabric is completely see through. No bueno."
2.0,"Beautiful product, but pink earrings arrived without the hooks for the ears. Each pair is in its own little baggie and I had not gotten our the pink ones until after my return window closed. Pretty bummed. ."
2.0,"These pants are not for petites with long legs.  The waist band is on my rib cage, the length is 13 inches too long.  Not what I expected or ordered."
2.0,One of the gloves weren’t working.
2.0,The posts for my pins are about the same size as a thumbtack and that is too large for these locks. These would be better suited to a tie tack or lapel pin.
2.0,"When we first got these, they worked very well.  Forty days later they would not charge properly, one shoe would not turn on when the button was pressed.  Instead it would turn itself on and off when it wanted to and stopped charging all together."
2.0,"The print was okay, but the dress fit so large. The fabric was also a weird, thin spandex material."
2.0,RUNS SLOW
2.0,Couldn’t even get my foot in.  Fabric does not give
2.0,"Quality is good, size is very false.. fit way to small. Does not look round."
2.0,"This set is cute but I feel it wasn’t made that great. Like if they pressed it and there permanent marks. They are faint, but at first I thought they were stains from a return product and they just sold it again. Other than that, very comfortable."
2.0,Looks terrible<br />Looks like not new
2.0,Not happy with these<br />The ends must be removed to add beads and while putting the beads on the leather braids come loose
2.0,"I bought two pairs, one broke already. They look good and all that but the hinges are pretty flimsy."
2.0,The purse is smaller than what it looks<br />It a size of a small make up bag<br /><br />It is for a toddler not a six year old
2.0,This skirt was to be used for our family pictures this fall.  It was very thin and so I was unable to wear it as I feared that with different light and angles you would be able to see through it.  Poor quality fabric but true to size.
2.0,It was too big and the zipper was not properly made but the seller was very nice therefore was given a FULL refund.
2.0,Giving this two stars bc the bodysuit itself isn't bad as far as fit and material. It does seem to run slightly large in the armpit area and has a weird neckline. The color however; is totally off. It is nothing like the green pictured in the description but more of a gray. Disappointed bc I needed a green one so this will be returned.
2.0,"It is very well-made.  However, it looks like a woman's belt in person.  It was advertised as a mens belt, but I have never felt comfortable wearing since I received it."
2.0,"Very cute style, but the buttons come loose easily."
2.0,"The center, or waist, of the suit is sewn so that the material will not stretch to go over your thighs. I could probably pull it on but the threads would snap. For the price I took a chance. Very cute suit & nice fabric but it's unwearable."
2.0,Delivery was right on schedule.<br /><br />Product is ok. Dislike that there’s no where to hide the wire and I feel it’s unsafe for kids. Just my opinion.
2.0,Side color makes shirts too stiff
2.0,"My kiddo loved this suit for swim team. Sadly, it didn't quite make it 3 months before it ripped. It was great while it lasted, but 3 months isn't long enough to warrant purchasing."
2.0,"I love how simple the ring looks, unfortunately there is a sharp part in it near the opening and can make wearing the ring painful"
2.0,Way to large. Much bigger then I expected.
2.0,"Too tight, so it keeps slipping backwards."
2.0,"The material is not what I was expecting at all. It reminds me a bit of a ribbed tank top, and it stretches out REALLY easily and within a couple of hours. Was also bigger than expected. Just wasn't what I was anticipating..."
2.0,Zipper broke when I was trying it on.  It fit fine and is very beautiful but is cheaply made
2.0,The picture doesn't accurately show what I received. The rose is a bright yellow. I liked the off white color I see in the picture.
2.0,"If these are polarised, they are the worst I've ever owned.  They do not reduce glare at all."
2.0,"These run really small, especially in the waist."
2.0,Not what I expected<br />costume jewelry
2.0,"looks horrible on, cheap material"
2.0,"I loved the color and dress, but it was a T-shirt on me. Only people that are smaller than 5’5 would it fit length wise I am guessing. Otherwise cute dress!"
2.0,It’s a little thinner material then I thought
2.0,"The part going to your piercing is very sharp, quite uncomfortable feel like it was cutting my ears."
2.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; 178lbs and I prefer a fitted shirt, not too tight but not loose either. A medium worked fine. The only problem is I'm not getting the shirt that I paid for delivered to me. This review comes after a 2nd attempt, but still I get the wrong shirt. Wasting my time! Guess I'm going to the mall now!"
2.0,These dresses look cute but the fabric feels too hot to wear in hot weather. Even just 5% of spandex makes 95% of cotton unwearable in hot temperatures. Polyester and spandex blend is even worse. Too bad
2.0,"Pretty print. The dress fit like a junior size, not misses size. Proportions were not right."
2.0,"When I first received my ring, it was really pretty and impressive. However, after wearing for 2 months, it's no longer shiny and pretty. Sooooo it's laying in my jewelry box."
2.0,Pros are the material is very soft and they fit true to size. Cons are waist elastic very tight and runs high on waist. Also they bag at knees after wearing for a short time. Don't waste your money. I already put in pile for donation.
2.0,It was cheap and it looks it.
2.0,"I mean... it's a soft button up shirt.  Size fit as expected.  The writeup makes a big deal about the traditional embroidery on the shirt, but there is no embroidery.  It just has three narrow pleats down each side.  If I were looking for a traditional shirt I'd look elsewhere. It does a basic three star job as ""a shirt"", but fails at being a culturally correct shirt (as I understand it) so that lowers my rating.<br />Basically: Do you like the picture? Do you want to pay the asking price for the shirt in the picture? That's up to you."
2.0,This is an among us two piece bathing suit not at all what was pictured. Cute but not what is pictured.
2.0,Very little information about this coat and took almost 2 weeks for arriving. Big for the size but a nice looking jacket
2.0,I asked if the bracelet would fit my eight inch wrist and it does not.  The beads are small as well.  It is more suitable for a child or teenage.
2.0,Runs a size larger
2.0,I was expecting better quality -wore once and after washing it started to unravel enough so I won't wear again
2.0,"It smelled weird, abd when I put it around my wrist it made cracking noises from the paint splitting"
2.0,"Incredibly disappointed. The item fell apart, smelled like sulfur and was difficult to use."
2.0,These run really small
2.0,"ordered this mostly for the ""it's my birthday"" headband for the birthday girl to wear but it was missing letters and broken. came very quickly after ordered though."
2.0,"I normally wear a 2-3 x, but ordered it larger since I like my sweaters to fit roomy. But this was clearly about a size xl- I ended up giving it away to someone who wears an xl. Disappointed as I bought it for myself."
2.0,Fit fine but the quality was not up to par. Material was thin and see through. Felt more like a dress up tutu than something I could wear out in public.
2.0,paper thin and zippers not working
2.0,Nice dress but WAY tighter and smaller than expected
2.0,The purple color was very muted and dull unfortunately. The shirt was also tight in the bra area. I would suggest going up 1 size for anyone interested.<br />Thanks!
2.0,did not work for my kids. received it fast
2.0,"This top is marketed as &#34;one size fits all&#34; where it should really be marketed &#34;one size fits small&#34; as that's the size they send according to the tag. I was highly disappointed with this company for falsely advertising this product's fit. fortunately I found the same top (same pattern and fabric) through a different retailer who actually offered sizes with a size chart for best fit. I would highly advise against buying this product unless you are a size 0-2 (my measurements are 37&#34; Bust and 27&#34; waist and the tie was fine/roomy, but the top couldn't even stretch to button shut)."
2.0,No. I did not think the finger tip touch was good enough to use on your phone screen
2.0,"This are very different from what the pictures show, very cheaply made. I bought them for my 10 year old, who won’t be as picky as I, so hopefully they stay up during soccer games."
2.0,"So I ordered xxl just to make sure they would fit. I’m 6,2 and oh boy are these small and tight. The quality seems good but the sizes are way off. Save your money and buy something else. I’m returning immediately."
2.0,"Beautiful dress, just didn’t fit on the  upper half."
2.0,"I really like this bracelet, but it broke the 2nd time I put it on my daughter. It is flimsy and not very well made. Would not recommend because of the quality."
2.0,"My partner liked the sweaters and the color, but they were way too small (she wears 6-8). Sent them back."
2.0,I ordered the blue one for my niece and they sent a gray bag. The bag doesn’t hold its shape.. kinda disappointing..
2.0,This is a Polyester cloth jacket...it does not look like picture and took two months for me to receive the item...i am disappointment
2.0,The lenses were very dark and also not very clear.
2.0,"I used these on my vacation in May. By the end of the trip I had taken everything out of the baggies and put them in a pocket of my suitcase. Good system in theory, but I felt like it made everything harder to cram into my suitcase."
2.0,Too tight in the hips.
2.0,After one wear for a couple hours it was tarnished and no longer gold. Disappointed
2.0,"I'm returning it because it didn't fit well. The top was very loose, so I'd you have a small chest, it's not going to fit."
2.0,"Back Strap already coming apart where it's suppose to be sewn, holding on by a thread."
2.0,"Was too small, zipper broke trying to zip it up. Fabric was uncomfortable and itchy. Headband is poorly made."
2.0,"I wore these pants for four days on a backpacking trip to the Wind River Mountain Range in Wyoming.  These pants are very lightweight, flexible, and have a tapper fit.  I was loving them for the first part of the trip but then came the log.  I went to step over a log on the way up the mountain and the crotch stitching ripped.  I was horrified.  This was the only pair of pants for four days.  Luckily my friend had brought a needle and thread.  I fixed them and had a great time but if he didn't I would have had a big hole in my pants.<br /><br />I also like the though fabric on the knees.  It may be good to add them to the butt too.  You sit on some crazy stuff in the outdoors more than you kneel."
2.0,Had it a month before it turned.
2.0,To tight and fabric was very uncomfortable to workout in.  Actually to thick around the waist and thighs.
2.0,Not true to fit!
2.0,"I wanted to like it. I wanted it to work... It is just too thin. Absorbs sweat/water/moisture very easily but is very thin so if you are sitting down, the water will be absorbed out of this thin hoodie towel... like I said, I realllly wanted this to work but is very thin."
2.0,"Terrible!!  I’m 135 lbs, 5’9. A large shouldn’t roll up while walking. Extremely small for a large. Returned 2 packages."
2.0,Need no boobs and a short torso
2.0,"I tried to send these back but you have to go through the vendor (not Amazon) and pay shipping. Total ripoff. These bandannas are thin, misshapen, with threads hanging off and badly screenprinted. They won't last three washings."
2.0,"I loved the length and pockets.The material was not at all what I had expected, and the craftsmanship was not the best."
2.0,"I ended up returning mine due to several reasons.<br /><br />First, the thing is huge. I should have paid closer attention to the dimensions, but I also thing the seller could list them more prominently in the listing and add one of those images of the silhouette holding the case.<br /><br />Second, the quality is nowhere near the $50 purchase price. The material is pretty cheap and I would say it is about $20 overpriced.<br /><br />Third, the product had a strong chemical smell. I am not sure if it was the dye used or just the materials, but it was definitely off-putting.<br /><br />As for the function, it does hold the watch bands nicely and they look sharp against the dark black fabric. Unfortunately I just had no idea where I would store the thing as it would take up half the top of the dresser."
2.0,"Paper thin material, runs one maybe two sizes smaller than marked.  Design is as pictured."
2.0,I love Homeyee dresses. I ordered a large (size 10). Which is my normal size. But it was way too tight and did not fit right. I have it to my much smaller friend. :)
2.0,cloth chain fell apart then black &#34;stone&#34; fell out lasted about 2 weeks dont waist your money.
2.0,This thing is garbage - probably why it's only 4 bucks (should be free). Nobody can tell there are shells in it - just a tacky piece of opaque blue plastic.
2.0,Wouldn’t stay on
2.0,Logo was awful
2.0,I'm sure I can still use these as an eyebrow piercing but they are far too small to be labeled as a septum piercing.
2.0,"My first charm came and it was very dull, and all scratched up. I reached out to the company and they said they will be sending me a replacement great! About 3 weeks later I contact them again because I still hadn’t received anything any they say “I’m sorry,I forgot” and arranged for my replacement to finally be shipped. Got the replacement and still the gems are very dull and the surface is all scratched up. Obviously the price is nowhere near name brand prices but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t sell quality things!"
2.0,"So cute and was very happy until one of the ears just came off. It wasn’t pulled on or anything, it just came off."
2.0,"Poor quality, odd fit! Very disappointing! Will not by again."
2.0,Very cute! But so super tight and I’d buy 1-2 sizes bigger than usual!
2.0,Nice glove but if you don't have 6 year old child hands they won't fit. Since I'm a 60 year old man I had to return them.
2.0,Too big and poorly made!
2.0,I am usually a 25-26 waist so I ordered a small and they fit like a 27-28 waist.
2.0,I could have bought my own fabric for cheaper. No seams.
2.0,Dress fits pretty snug but other than that I really like it
2.0,This shirt is too small in the bust.
2.0,"Really cute bag, but the handles are not attached securely. I felt like they are constantly in danger of falling off."
2.0,"it was very large, I was swimming in it."
2.0,Had I know that this order contained some bracelets with indecent language I would NEVER had purchased these for my daughter's 16th birthday party. Unfortunate too because the others are nice and quality is decent.
2.0,"The dress itself isnt too bad. I am 5'7 with 32dd, 25 waist and 37 hips and the XS fit ok. Lots of stretch. BUT omg, the fabric is like a cheap table cloth. It feels like plastic. It actually made noise when I moved hahaha. I am guessing this would wear ok once then would be garbage once washed. The smocked area didn't fit nicely- like normal fabric when smocked. My chest area had weird bumps and indentations when I put it on. My chest is larger tho so this may not happen with everyone. I would pay lk $2 for this dress if I was to keep it. Definitely not worth $20 or anywhere near that"
2.0,"Shirt size and fabric are fine. Not quite heavy enough material and a bit on the tight side (6’2” 2600 lbs), but the image/printing is essentially gone after 6 times through the washing machine. The printing was the only reason I bought the shirt.<br /><br />Months later:  The seller saw this review and reached out to me in an attempt to make things right. I appreciate their efforts and I’d recommend dealing with them anytime."
2.0,"Great idea & warm fleece hat, but the opening for the ponytail is much too low."
2.0,"Is a cute top, but three sizes too small. I gave it to my friend, whom it fits. Also cheaply made"
2.0,"very thin and narrow below unworthy of hugo boss name, dissapointed"
2.0,legs are to tight
2.0,"can't use them, a waste of money"
2.0,not just too small but way small -I ordered an XL and it seemed like it was a small -I've never had a product that was so mis-sized. And skirt was floor length which I didn't expect as it is calf length on model and I am 5'4.
2.0,"I wanted to like this watch. It looks very good and it's minimal design was just what I wanted. When a piece broke on it, I sent it back to warranty. I waited 3 weeks for the watch to come back, and low and behold when it did the piece wasn't even fixed. I don't know what took 3 weeks to do, but it wasn't to fix the watch. I contacted MVMT immediately and they were more than happy to replace just the watch face. In an email they told me that it's super easy to switch out the watch faces. When I clicked on their video it told me I needed a special springbar tool. Yeah I just have one of those laying around here. So another $7 purchase and some more time maybe I'll get my watch back in working order. If you're looking for a non expensive nice (looking) watch and love headaches this is the watch of your dreams!"
2.0,Quite possible I could be arrested for indecent exposure if I wore this white dress in public without another dress underneath it. I included pictures of  a shapewear slip under it and the slight seams burst through the paper thin fabric. I wanted a white dress to wear under a cute duster. I can't even wear this as an under-layer because it is so ridiculously see through. I  made a huge mistake by not returning this  during the exchange window... So now it is a nightgown that I'm still embarrassed to wear because it's so transparent.
2.0,"My wrists are really big and i put it on the smallest setting and it was still to big. Not to mention the bracelet kept coming apart. The look is cool, but not much else"
2.0,"I bought these as a gift for my 8 year old granddaughter and though they say they're adult sized, I wonder if they will be too small. Not what I was expecting."
2.0,Design on socks disappointing. Not good design of garden accessories in sock design
2.0,"It came pretty smashed. I've ordered hats before and they have always come in a box with some kind of bubble wrap in the box as well. So i was kind of surprised to see a bag for the product. And when i opened it, the hat was flat. I was able to reshape the hat and bend the bill the front back to shape. Also, even though it is adjustable, the cap itself isnt very deep so it doesnt stay no matter how loose or how tight  i make it. its nice to look at but i wont be wearing it any time soon, probably going to re-gift it as a gag gift."
2.0,"The image is blown out of proportion. It's not a clear as the image shown on here. The rest of the mask is good. I like the feel of the material, more breathable than the disposable masks. And the adjustable ear straps and great. Only complaint is the image."
2.0,It's too loose and big size ...
2.0,"If you take it out to clean it, the clasp stops staying closed pretty quickly. Also, the stones started falling out of it after the weeks of use. They're gorgeous, but not for long term wear."
2.0,"Thin material, runs small."
2.0,Sags down while you run. Cheap material
2.0,It's too small across the shoulders.
2.0,"I bought this around st paddy’s day, but it has already chipped off a chunk. It was a nice item, but didn’t last very long. It was never dropped, so unsure what happened. I would love to get a replacement."
2.0,I cannot wear this as a business dress as it is too short but I also do not like the material at all. I ended up giving it away bc I forgot to return
2.0,This is a good product but it doesn’t have nearly enough string to tie in the front of a man with a 36 inch waist.  Not even close.<br />I find it difficult to ties an apron in the back so I bought this apron to eliminate that problem. It didn’t
2.0,"I should have read the reviews before impulse purchasing. The ears are turned outwards instead of front facing, keeping the beanie from having cat ears- they're more like weird sideways bear ears. Unimpressed, but one star was given for a quick-ish delivery and that the beanie fit."
2.0,"These gloves are very small.  My hand is 7” from base of palm to tip of middle finger, and both the glove finger length and overall glove length feel short.  It wouldn’t be so terrible, if the gloves actually stayed on when you tried to use them - they inch up, exposing the palm and reducing overall dexterity.  At time of purchase I didn’t realize it, but I think the last photo must be kid hands.  I would not recommend these for an adult."
2.0,"After reading reviews I ordered this top. It was a return. It runs SUPER small and it's the stretchy, but clingy type of material. I was disappointed. Just not the top for me."
2.0,"The quality is quite poor. I guess I should have expected that for the price. It's way too skinny as well, not even 2&#34; at the widest point."
2.0,"This product didn't fit like I wanted it to, it was a okay but."
2.0,The back is shear and shows your full bra in back.  Not a style I ilke.  I will be returning it.
2.0,Not made of good material. Literally one of the bracelets broke within 2 weeks of having it. Has also started to become tarnished on the lion head. It is a very poorly assembled accessory. Would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.
2.0,These pants are made of a very thin material.  They were too short on me and I sent them back.
2.0,too large for an adult face. Never wore them  Can I return them.
2.0,Paper thin. Not even the right pattern.
2.0,"I didn’t like the fact that you could see the stitching on the arm. It’s not that tight, and it don’t compress. I’m 5 “7” 1/2...150 lbs. I ordered a medium. Sleeve could’ve been longer and the shirt could’ve been tighter. I returned this item."
2.0,"Very very thin fabric, mine had a nail head sized hole in the collar but honestly it's fabric is too thin to fix safely. Not the worst,  but nothing to rush and buy.."
2.0,"This is a hoop, but not what I would call an earring. It opens by pulling it apart & closes by pushing it together, leaving a small gap. There is not an actual clasp or way to make it one full hoop after closing & hair gets caught where it doesn’t connect."
2.0,"Tons of motorcycle branding logos, not a lot of just pure patterns."
2.0,watch band fell apart right away
2.0,"The slogan for this brand is “Good but no better”...... I would say “OK, but spend the extra $20 for a real brand” would be better fitting.<br /><br />The shoes come with the longer spikes, so I purchased 1/4in spikes to replace. However some of the holes appear to not be standard size and the spikes don’t screw in tight. we lost 2 within the first practice.<br /><br />The sole of the shoe is very hard plastic and not flexible. My daughter complained about them being uncomfortable on day 1 (yet she was fine in Adidas). The fabric also appears to be cheap and poorly stitched, but can’t give a full assessment on that as they held up for 1 day, and we probably won’t use them again to fully test their durability.<br /><br />I guess all-in-all they’re better than nothing- but if you’re struggling to find youth spikes I would suggest Nike or VS Athletics. Try resell places like eBay and Poshmark too!"
2.0,It is beautiful but the black wares off and you are left with a discolored wrist band. It is extremely hard to get it into place. I would pass on this one and find a better replacement.
2.0,Fits a little bit awkward but maybe that's because i got a size too big
2.0,Not able to adjust strap. Cute would be ok for a long torso
2.0,Does not Fit as intended or expected. Too lose. Need for sizing down
2.0,"The sizing chart was spot on, the dress itself was super cute but completely see through as it was so thin. Sadly I have to return this."
2.0,"Was looking for thin high density thin padding for 12 mile commute.  Padding very unsubstantial.  Pad itself is very small, about the size of a mtn bike seat so that seam is right at edge of seat.  Must be worn inside out to prevent skin being worn raw.<br /><br />If pad has a slightly larger diameter and the padding was a higher density like neoprene it would be what I was expecting."
2.0,"Runs very small, and it’s cheaply made. Save your money."
2.0,"The cons: The bra seems to have too much cloth, has construction and fit issues—it rides a big higher under the armpit than one is accustomed to. Since the fabric is loosey-goosey and the front cross gaps open, trying to get the bra the right side up will take a few minutes because in and out, wrong and right gets tangled. I washed the bra before first use. The padding came out—who sleeps in a padded bra, anyway? Worse yet, the nylon triangular lining on the pad came off. So there it was, 3 bras with only one pad left in after washing. Anyway, I sorted the bras out and decided I didn't want the song and dance of trying to get the pads back in because they'd only come out again when washed.<br /><br />The pros: With the padding, the bras fit comfortably and are right sized. With the padding, since the fabric of the bra itself is loose-goosey, I thought they would be too big. Instead, the bras fit snugly over the boobs, and the only slight discomfort was the too short armpit hole which seems to choke a bit.<br /><br />Final assessment: Will I buy this set of bras again? I doubt it. Too much fabric, and I don't like how it's constructed. Instead, I'll look for more of the Gilligan & O'Malley bra which has none of the issues plaguing this one."
2.0,"Distroid Fast, but is beautiful"
2.0,"Broke after 2 days, don’t waste your money."
2.0,"These shirts are made strange. There is so much room &#34;around&#34; but there is NO length to them. I bought a size up looking for a big shirt, I am swimming in the top of it but the bottom barely comes to my waist. The sleeves are a strange cap-ish type sleeve with a lot of room which is odd. All in all they make good shirts to sleep in but I wouldn't wear them anywhere."
2.0,"Just a note. If you are planning to wear this for the summer, dont for two reasons<br /><br />1. The material is rough and not soft. it will make a noise every time you want<br />2. The material is itchy and thats the worst material you can have in a hot day. you will want to tear this pant off when the temperature goes up."
2.0,"Good as a pair of readers, but not for distance."
2.0,"Colors are nice but sizing was incorrect, way too small"
2.0,"This product is nice but the background doesn't remind me of Hazbin at all. Similarly, it is not very comfortable to wear and strange looking on the head."
2.0,The simulated pearl looks great but the post is so cheaply made and lacks a groove for friction . I have to constantly adjust it because they keep slipping off. I am afraid it is going to fall down one of these days.
2.0,it did not look like on the picture at all it should of been a little less than the price point . will say that the measurement of sizing was to the tea but that was about it  I thought it was going to be cotton material. it like a polyester materiel.
2.0,"Cheap material.  Might be OK for a one-time wear throwaway dress if the top seams were sewn so that the top lay flat (poor stitching = puckering).  If you still want to try it, a size 8 was an XL."
2.0,"One side of the band will most stay on all the way to my Surge. The holes for the screws didn’t line up correctly, and stretching them so that the screws went in was the only way to secure the band to the Fitbit.<br /><br />Shortly after writing this review, the band came of when I started sprinting, and my Fitbit went flying 10 feet in front of me."
2.0,Loved it until I wore it then washed it. Now it's faded and will probably never wear again.
2.0,I like the design and feel of this shirt but it's way too small. I'm going to give it to my 9 year old niece.
2.0,very cute but the white is completely see- through!
2.0,2 stars for the appearance only. The backs fall off and don’t grip. Honestly can’t use them because I’m afraid of losing them. Huge disappointment.
2.0,"I'm 5'8 the length is too short, they are baggy in areas they should fit snd just not comfortable."
2.0,"The Wednesday series has made this dress all the rage. It's not particularly soft or stretchy and fairly unforgiving in that regard. It's durable enough, but the sizing is not accurate for a Medium (or at least, for an American woman's medium), so order a size up."
2.0,Such a cute unique apple watch band. I get lots of compliments on it.  Rose gold tarnishes in 3 mths- i wish it was real gold plating or silver and would last longer. I would pay extra for that because i love the look of this band.
2.0,"The reason I bought these was because I was lead to believe these were &#34;Oversized&#34;.<br /><br />Here is a picture of the Oversized pair I bought on the left and pair I purchased on the right at the dollar store. Not only is your quality of vision better with the dollar store shades, they also aren't unbelievably dark like these oversized shades."
2.0,"The sweater is comfortable, but is not at all long and off the shoulder. The color was as expected. Would not buy agian."
2.0,Worthless watch don't waste money it broke in 5 min
2.0,These feel ok but they wear out very quickly.
2.0,&#34;One size fits most&#34; means the size is lg/xlg
2.0,The bag is a little stiff. Would like an outside pocket but size is good with twin inside dividers. Would have preferred it to be a bit more supple and not that plastic smell
2.0,complicated to adjust
2.0,"Jacket ripped when i put it on, had to throw it out, looked good though."
2.0,"I have been looking into this 90s trend that's coming back, and I thought this one would be so cute. I got it in the mail and when I went to put it on the clasp fell out of the hook. I was really bummed because it was such a cute choker in person too...I didn't get to wear it and returned it."
2.0,"I LOVE the case they came in the hard case with a cleaning cloth inside was very nice. The glasses are nice and light they do not look bad at all. Overall the product would be good had it have fit. My glasses at the widest point are 5.15 inches. My lenses are within spec but still they would not fit inside very well. Also, it made me have a problem seeing. The sunglasses themselves would push the glasses to where one lense would be closer to one eye than the other because it is lifting on the stems or pushing back on your face and this made it very disorienting. I am not sure if this was just because the glasses were not labelled the right size or if was a problem with the glasses themselves. If you would like to simulate what I am talking about take your finger and press one lense of you glasses closer to your face. It is very off-setting. I think if they had been the right size it would have been an awesome product. I hate to give it a 2 star review but this just will not work for me."
2.0,Zipper malfunction almost immediately!
2.0,Most were not lined up for putting on chains
2.0,They do slip down over your face.  I didn’t love these.
2.0,The mask was uncomfortable and required assembly with the ventilation attachments. It was hot on the face as well.
2.0,I ordered up a siz because I don't like really tight clothes. I should have ordered my regular size but I still would not have liked the style.  Looks okay in the front but in the back of the dress the skirting has some very odd pleating - makes the dress &#34;poof&#34; out in the back - not a flattering look - I will  return the dress.
2.0,I could not get them to stay on my ears.
2.0,"They were ok, the lens was a lot lighter than I expected. They're very lite in wight, they seem like they could bend easily."
2.0,Super cute but very slick.  I felt like i would fall in them.  I didn't want to mess with trying to add something to them so they wouldn't feel slick on the floor because I didn't want to take the chance of not being able to return them if that didn't work.  Loved how they looked though.
2.0,"Normally one size fits all fits, but not in this case. Very uncomfortable, and I'm just an average sized guy. Too bad too, because I love North Face product historically."
2.0,Not are flowy as I expected. Material is cheap...
2.0,The pictures make them look WAY more flatering than they are. My friend’s said they made me look like a hobbit... I felt like I was wearing clown shoes. I have other zero drop boots that arent nearly as ugly.
2.0,super cheap.
2.0,Not only were these shorter than I expected but the fabric was anything but comfortable feeling.  I returned them and will keep searching for a more comfortable pair.
2.0,"I typically wear a size 12/14, bought the XXL based on reviews.  I'm 5' 6&#34; and bust is 36DD.  The bottoms fit perfectly!  The top had way too much loose fabric hanging over the elastic band at the waist.  Almost looked like I was pregnant.  The &#34;sports bra&#34; at the top was the main problem.  The elastic band was way too big, didn't even come close to supporting my chest or even touching my rib cage.<br /><br />Bought the pink as well as the blue.  They did fit slightly differently than one another but both had the same issues.  Had to return them."
2.0,"The gloves are warm, HOWEVER, they are NOT waterproof!!!  We used them in the snow and they were completely soaking wet. We had to dry them with a blow dryer to use them later on that day. That didn't work well as it took a very long time and they still weren't completely dry.  I was very surprised since the discription says they are water proof."
2.0,The collar is ridiculously large. The shirt size is “Small” Collar measures 17”.  Shirt fits great otherwise.  Sleeves a little long but not unexpected.
2.0,They are ok but I was looking for more green
2.0,My son loved the design but they pilled after a few washes.
2.0,"The watch looked good but there were some problems. The first one we came across was that the watch isn't for small wrists and it is incredibly difficult to resize, especially since the watch didn't come with the tool that was supposed to be with it. Even after we bought some tools, it was nearly impossible to get the pins out. The watch was slow too; we wound the watch and a day later, it was the wrong time (and yes the battery was working). There were just too many problems to handle, so we returned it."
2.0,"This piece is sooo cute but the post on it is ridiculously short. I figured I would just use the post of another piece because every single piece of internally threaded jewelry I have can be switched with the post from other pieces(no matter where they were bought, piercing shop, amazon, online jewelry store. Literally every piece can be switched with each other!). That is not the case with this piece! You can use the post it comes with and that's it! Very disappointing because I was so excited to wear this."
2.0,The material feels lovely but the cut is just so strange that I had to return it. Weirdly boxy in some places and tight in others
2.0,"Does not fit as per the sizing chart.  Order at least 1 size up, if not two sizes."
2.0,"The glasses look very cheap.<br />I understand the price was low, but since I had read good reviews about them, I thought I'd ordered a pair for myself.<br />But sadly, I didn't like them."
2.0,"Like the style, and they fit great. But the first day I wore them they ripped across the seam of the back pocket. Mind you they are loose fitting so they didnt get stretched just poor materials. would like to find some like these with better materials so I can wear them more than once. Bummed and out the price I paid"
2.0,"I'm 5'3 and  I have put on a few extra lbs (size 10) and I wanted something loose, but this is HUGE. Makes me look bigger than I am. Not flattering."
2.0,"With summer coming and the pools and beaches calling, I have been gathering up the essentials for fun in the sun. Last year I learned the hard way that wearing your day to day slip-ons to any water activity is not a good idea, nor is it smart to not wear anything. This year I wised up and looked for water socks to wear in the sand or poolside.<br /><br />The good:<br />- These water socks are very comfortable. They fit snug, but not tight. I wouldn’t go so far as to say “feels like being barefoot”, but they don’t feel like bulky shoes.<br />- They fit perfectly when using the size chart. For reference, I am a size 6 1/2 women’s and I ordered a large.<br />- They are cute. I like that they are basic black and are very low cut.<br />- Price is reasonable.<br />- Non slip surface on the bottom<br />The bad:<br />- They don’t last. I have had them for less than a month and already the seams are breaking apart. I have worn them 4 times, haven’t used them on rough surfaces (I put my shoes on over them when walking to and from) and I keep my toenails short so I am not sure why they would be coming apart so soon.<br /><br />So, as much as I like them, I would not re-purchase them nor would I recommend them. I break it down like this...I paid $9.99 for them, got 4 uses out of them before they started breaking apart, that’s $2.50ish per use. Seems a little high.<br /><br />No disclosure needed - I am a “reviewer” of Amazon products and often get things at a discount, however this item I have bought at FULL price for my own personal use. Thank you for reading my review!"
2.0,"I'm a petite person, 5' 1&#34; waist 25. So I'm used to things being a bit too big for me. I ordered the smallest size at least expecting a form-fit considering these are described as compression shirts. Even if it did fit the material is waaay to thin to be considered anything near compression, and if it did fit the stitching is much like a regular shirt, no sports movement in mind.<br />I do weight lifting and was looking for long sleeved workout shirts-this may be good for people doing lighter workouts, but I wouldn't recommend for heavy workouts.<br /><br />I don't think the price is unfair at all for what I received"
2.0,Runs small with no stretch AT ALL
2.0,Just received this today.  Returning .  Bought size 2-4 toddler and too large for my 4 year old.  Also the seam in the front is coming undone.  Very poorly made.
2.0,"Beautiful pair of shoes by Micheal Kors for a reasonable price yet painful to wear. I literally got two days of use out of them. I admit my feet tend to hurt when breaking in a new pair of shoes and as someone with a high-tolerance of pain, I was surprised I could not continue using these flats into day two. I broke down and stopped at a DSW for another pair as my day was far from complete."
2.0,It was small and the material was itchy.
2.0,"Chain is nice, but the clasp broke when I put it on the next day. I replaced it with one that I took off an ankle bracelet I no longer wear. Would not recommend buying this company's jewelry."
2.0,se ve muy diferente en la foto que en la realidad nada que ver
2.0,Junky metal. Cannot adjust to smaller ears. Ones with post were missing backs
2.0,I had to return it . It was much to small and it was very low quality ..
2.0,"flatted easily, no support"
2.0,Super cute watch band but I’ve only been wearing it for 7 days & it’s already fading.
2.0,"Lens was too light, didn't keep out enough sunshine.  Returned."
2.0,If your calves aren't the size of a 12 year old...don't bother. Gave them to my kid👎
2.0,Uncomfortable and couldn’t see
2.0,"This dress gives absolutely no stretch. If you are top heavy, I recommend going a size up. The dress is super cute but I just wasn't pleased with the fit."
2.0,Cute design but fades significantly after a few washes. Compression only ok. Also don’t have a sock shape...more of a cylinder shape. Poor print quality on white socks and design stretches/doesn’t maintain design well when worn. Would not buy again.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt, but it was so incredibly small and stiff. I felt like one wrong move and the entire shirt would split apart. Sadly I had to return it."
2.0,"I'm somewhere between a US size 6 & 8, and an XL should have fit, according to the size chart. Was very tight in the arms and shoulders and wouldn't close around me. Nowhere near as long as it appeared in the pictures. Will only fit you if you are very thin and very petite."
2.0,"they look NOTHING like in the picture, they are neon orange"
2.0,Not worth the cost poorly made<br />Runs slim and long
2.0,Cute but top too small.
2.0,Very nice look but it falls off easily. I had to stick the handles in my hair.
2.0,"I liked the material but was looking for fleece and this was a thin, lightweight cotton. It also was very long...to my calf, and too baggy. I wanted a relaxed fit but not too loose and not too fitted.  I am 5'3"", wear a women's medium top and a size 10 dress."
2.0,"The description was not adequate; however, I will use it, having bought it even though it doesn't exactly fit my wallet."
2.0,"I am normally a size small, but I ordered a medium in this tank because I didn't want it to be too fitted. Unfortunately, when I got it and tried it on it was VERY tight, and it laid above my belly button like a super crop top. It definitely wasn't as pictured in the model. I had to have my fiance help get me out of it."
2.0,It fits o.k. but is much much shorter than it appears to be in the photos.  I cannot wear a dress this short.
2.0,Shorts are great and would have given 5 stars except the zipper tab broke less than a month after getting them so they are essentially useless now.
2.0,Looked nice but too small
2.0,I was expecting a heavy thermal top but instead got a paper thin poly/cotton blend that wouldn't keep anyone warm. Way too thin and flimsy.
2.0,"I bought this set specifically for the blue paisley design one, the rest were just extras. It said the set was Color: Set 004 - Purple and Grey Assorted but since the sets contain additional colors I went by the photo that very shows blue on 2 of my computers. Unfortunately it is not the blue I was expecting but a purple that I really do not care for. There is one predominantly grey square that is nice. Shipping was fast hence the extra star although I am disappointed."
2.0,I order a medium size .... yet it was too small -_-
2.0,"This is a very pretty watchband. Unfortunately, the butterflies started peeling off after the third day of normal wear. =("
2.0,The mask is very big . It seems that they made it to fit the size of the K of C logo .
2.0,this doesn’t fit like other sets i ordred like this one this one is small
2.0,"Thin material,coming apart at the seams . Must of used child slave labor on theses ."
2.0,"Viste chico , cuando lo lavas un horroroso todo ese filo blanco se mancha de verde no quede contenta"
2.0,"My daughter wrote these for the first time for 2 hours at a splash pad. The toe decoration piece is already coming loose and her toe is poking through. It's not because the shoes are too small. They're very flimsy for kids running around while wet, which is what we purchased them for. I'm sure they're wonderful if you only wear them in the pool."
2.0,"These pins are very cute! However, the backings on 90% of them are useless. They won't hold the pin on. Look elsewhere, or expect to buy new backings to replace the ones that come with the pin."
2.0,I really loved them but they were a little cheaply made or something the rock kept falling off one of the earrings and then it just Broke on the first and only day I got to wear them.
2.0,Not happy with purchase!!!
2.0,The legs are so tight! I have small thighs and it cut into mine. They’re not stretchy. Ended up returning them because it was so uncomfortable.
2.0,it is not confutable for kids.
2.0,"I ordered this watch for two simple reason. First, it is easy to read the time when your vision is not perfect anymore. Second, waterproof. I can wear this watch when I take a shower or swim. I would not ask for more &#34;bells and whistles&#34; from watch which cost less than $60 bucks but if this watch cannot withstand water after swimming only for two hours (not even diving) then two stars will be very generous of me. Sorry, but I rather spend $10 and wear two years (battery limit) plastic Casio than this shiny thing and not to see time after swimming."
2.0,The collar on this shirt is huge and looks weird.
2.0,Runs very small. I ordered a Medium (my regular size) and the sleeves barely came past me elbows. Had to return.
2.0,"I like it, but it looks big size."
2.0,Bought this for my son to hike with me at Red River Gorge and it pretty much fell apart on the first time out.  Two of the straps ripped just tightening them up.  I threw it in the trash when we got home.  Do not waste your money on this bag.
2.0,Colors not what I expected or the thickness. I won't be wearing these much.
2.0,"Polarizing seems to try to polarize, but is more like looking through 3D glasses... makes you dizzy"
2.0,Way too small. Order a size or two up.
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter and it did not work out.  I am 5'2 and it is long on me.  I don't recommend this for young YOUTH as stated in the description.  I know it says extra long, but it is really extra long.  I don't recommend this item if you are buying it for an 8 year old."
2.0,Button fell off before i put them on
2.0,Not sturdy and can’t open the cage. Fake pearls were included but hard to put them in the cage.
2.0,Way too small gave it to my mom and looks nice on her.
2.0,Is tarnishing! Don' t remember exactly why I bought this!
2.0,"Unfortunately, as cute as this is, it broke right away. I recommend shopping around, I chose this because of price and got what I paid for."
2.0,only had it for 3 months and the hooks are breaking on the back
2.0,Hat is simply too small.
2.0,"Very cheaply made for the price you pay. I received and looked it over noticed right away the ""leather strap"" is junk plastic also the strap is way too short for the average man's wrist. The watch itself is light and junky feeling and looking. I returned it immediately."
2.0,Es linda pero pedí talla S y me llegó xxl. Ahora tengo que gastar más plata en achicarla porque no tienen stock para cambiar la talla
2.0,"Super pretty, Center diamond fell out the day I wore it :("
2.0,"After washing, the socks looked ok, but when I tried putting them on, I realized they shrunk!"
2.0,Returning this item because of the amount of shine. Looks like a costume. Not a fan. But the stretch is amazing
2.0,Arrived with no face on the earrings. Hard to tell what it is...
2.0,broke 2 days use
2.0,"It's only got one hook and eye fastener on it, so if you have anything above an a-cup it won't work. Also, I'm a size 8-10 and had trouble getting it around my waist. Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Not like picture top stone way too large for ring set my opinion only. I think a smaller stone would look better on the setting.
2.0,Cute purse no pockets just a purse...the chain is extremely short...or I'm really tall
2.0,Some of the superman logo was cut off
2.0,"The color was lovely but the fabric was thin and clingy, did not fit as I had expected."
2.0,"While a handy umbrella, it's nearly impossible to close. I have to fight with it to retract after using this device. If I could return this I would but now it's outside the return window for time. You're better off to get a Totes umbrella at your local grocery store."
2.0,"The cut of this dress is very cute. It runs small, order a size up.  This dress in particular is a little itchy because of the metallic threading and the black fabric doesn't breath well at all."
2.0,Awesome looking mask. The mask has a very strong  smell. Hung it outside for a day and it was better.
2.0,"Straps too short for me. I ordered a large and a medium. Same issue.  Have only been refunded for one suit. Both returned.  Seller, help me out!"
2.0,This product had no support.  Material is loss.  If your skinny minnie and need zero support to feel comfort this is for you.
2.0,"Beware this suit covers very little!  My daughter saw this online and loved it, but when it actually arrived after WEEKS in transit, she was completely disappointed because it was too skimpy even by her 16 year old standards."
2.0,"I requested these as a gift because I thought these were a great deal. You get 20 total, two of each colors I have in my photo. At first I was very happy with them but after wearing them for a few days they started unraveling for a couple reasons. 1) The thread is silky and shiny, which is fine, but there is absolutely no friction to keep them tied. I put 6 knots in one I put on my ankle and it fell off a few hours later. I got in the habit of constantly checking and re-knotting them when I wore them, which was annoying, but at least I wasn't losing them anymore. 2) The ends of these were only held together with a lump of dried glue from a hot glue gun, which was very scratchy and irritating to have against your skin. Each one I have worn has disassembled with no way to fix them. They are listed as bracelets but they work much better as anklets. The couple I have worn as a bracelet I had to cut the ties much shorter, which resulted in the ends immediately getting all fuzzy looking. I think these are only worth the price as party favors for a children's party or something, but if you want something to last you more than a few days, look elsewhere."
2.0,Low quality material with flaws in the side-seams
2.0,"Liked the top of the dress and the colors were as pictured, but I couldn't get over the extremely cheap polyester skirt. There's some polyester out there that looks OK, but this is heavy and cheap-looking. Will be sending it back."
2.0,I only got a good 4 uses out of these before they tore down the butt :(
2.0,Beautiful but the posts were bent!
2.0,"The dress itself is absolutely gorgeous, I read everyone's comment saying to order a size up so I did-I'm normally a size 10 and I ordered a 12 but the top of the dress is VERY small so I need to return it. I'm actually really disappointed because the dress is so beautiful but if I need to order a 14 to get the top to fit and get the rest tailored idk if it's even worth it. I'm still weighing my options."
2.0,These are pretty and just what I wanted but the silver one broke before I even used it.  Went to open one end clip and the whole clip assembly fell apart.  Used the bronze one instead.  So disappointed.
2.0,"This was absolutely gorgeous! Unfortunately it took longer then expected to receive, and it was almost too small. I was very disappointed."
2.0,"It looks silver but I got gold, wanted silver"
2.0,Don't waist your time
2.0,Sweater arrived terribly wrinkled and the sleeves are much shorter than shown on the model in the photo. The fabric is very thin and shows every lump and bump underneath. Not the quality I'd expect from this brand. I ordered my usual size and it seemed on the small side.
2.0,These pants are giant. Too long too wide too everything. This item ships from LandsEnd and costs $5 to return.
2.0,"The style was not what I suspected, and ended up returning it. I usually where a size medium and bought that size. I recommend going a size up."
2.0,Very very cheap material!
2.0,The Small was so tight I couldn't fit it over my shoulders. The material is as tight as it could possibly be.
2.0,"This scarf is very nice,  I really do like it but the REAL PROBLEM is the color! I ordered a BROWN one & received a burnt red color one instead!  Are people working for this company &#34;Colored Blind&#34;?!!! Now I have to go out & but something that matches the scarf."
2.0,I have a flat butt but I’ve never had the issue of falling leggings like I do with these. They fit fine but I think it’s the slippery material. Just really weird fit for me. They are soft and comfortable for the few seconds before they fall
2.0,"Large and roomy, but does not look like the picture.  Purse material kind of thin, so maybe that's why it was reduced.  Material does not even look like leather.  Disappointed."
2.0,Was happy with the product until the lens started having a defect issue? Not sure what has happened but it’s getting worse. Had this product 3 weeks until this started.
2.0,"button wouldnt fit through the hole it was sewed shut basically, id rather spend a little more and get a high quality pair of wranglers."
2.0,One piece version would be best. It is never straight when trying to adjust and the extra band constantly comes out sticks out.
2.0,"Buyer beware !!!! These pants are extremely see-through when you are bending over!!! I always do the “bend over in front of mirror test” before I remove the tags. This one has been the worst I have come across yet. I could literally see the lace, patter and color of my thong. I could see my rear crack and all.<br /><br />Now I work out at a boot camp so the rear is in the air doing Burpee‘s and mountain climbers often so this is a no go for me.<br /><br />HOWEVER standing up in front of the mirror is NOT see through. So if you want to run in them I’m sure they will be fine. Or if you wear long shirts that always cover the rear.<br /><br />I did not test them in natural lighting.<br /><br />Shame too! The pant is cute.  Appears to be made of good quality, however I won’t be able to put that to the test. Will be returning."
2.0,"I am a huge fan of ""The Legend of Zelda"", especially ""Majora's Mask"" so I HAD to get these and the all where amazing .... Except the most iconic one the ""Triforce"" clip, the triforce was Upside Down ??? lol. keep the other 3 and gave that one to a nephew who also likes the series."
2.0,Nice material but was larger than expected. Left pocket sewn in backwards towards hip which is aggravating. Will probably throw away or donate.
2.0,That ear ring was pretty but much too big for conch piercing and the post is long. The earring is two to three times larger than shown in the photo on the ear.
2.0,the jewel fell out within 20 minutes of wearing and was lost.
2.0,"Its hard to put the little ball back on, on all of them. i just gave up"
2.0,Made in Chinese sizes. order larger or not at all
2.0,"Beautiful , quick delivery."
2.0,Honestly the color is more red than red/pink like it looks in the photo. I'm not a fan.
2.0,"This bracelet was not how I pictured it. It looked rather cheaply made, and was very large. (There was no clear indication on the site how large it was.)<br />The customer service was great, though. They processed my return quickly, issuing a refund before the product had reached them!"
2.0,"I received this on Thursday and used it the first day I got it. Today is Saturday and it is broken. The rod that is in the back of the corset has popped out, uncomfortable and poking me. I'd like to receive another one from the seller. If I have a different experience I'll update my review."
2.0,I did not like the necklace or hat
2.0,The mask is smaller and thinner than the Korean mask of the same design. Disappointed.
2.0,This dress runs really big.
2.0,"These are perfect for women who do not have DD sized boobs. I bought them. Put them on and laughed so hard, I started to cry.  They pretty much covered my nipple. No lift, no promised clevage, no coverage. I have no idea why I had so much hope for these sticky bra cups."
2.0,Small and cheaply made. Zipper already ripped off.
2.0,This item was not sized right. It was smaller at the top more than the bottom.
2.0,The first 2 photos of this product are very misleading and not even an accurate color.<br />I’m sure you could find better leggings elsewhere for this price...
2.0,"Honestly, the other masked that people got look great. Mine is pretty lack luster. I’m going to customize it a bit and see if that helps."
2.0,"Material was soft and silky, but it was somewhat small."
2.0,"Way to large, ill have to see if I can fix it with my sewing machine. Too bad, I wanted to like this top. The fabric design is so cute."
2.0,A bit too chrome looking for my taste but not bad for the price.
2.0,These earrings were too heavy for my ears so I had to return them.
2.0,these rusted pretty fast.
2.0,"I always order/buy small tops -- these fit well at the shoulders, but run small at the bottom and tend to ""ride"" up -- do not stay pulled down.  I am constantly yanking them down -- and know I do not have a large stomach!  Otherwise quality is fine."
2.0,"I think it has bad fabric, I didn’t like. The details are poorly made."
2.0,Excellent color and fabric but poorly stitched! My throned apart after couple month of weekly use.
2.0,The color of the stones are more gold than the silver I was expecting. It scratches my finger when I am texting and I am going to throw it in the garbage.
2.0,Wasn't impressed with the feel or the way it fit. Sent it back
2.0,Won’t stay on my head
2.0,A lot smaller than I expected
2.0,"I thought I was going to get a pink rhinestone keychain and when it came in the mail, it was multicolored and some of stones were falling off :("
2.0,"I bought for work as a waitress, after my 4th wear the have little balls all over the thighs where my apron rubs.  They are almost see through on the thighs now.  I almost immediately ordered more because they are so comfort and I guess if I was in an office,  sitting down,  not moving with nothing rubbing against them they would be good.  I was so disappointed"
2.0,This thing looks comically square and stiff when you actually put it on. Would not recommend.
2.0,"I was thoroughly disappointed. It fits a little tight with the &#34;cinched&#34; band. And the back-side sags. I've worn this material for years in Croft & Barrow boxers, so thought this would be better, but they weren't. The material was fine, but the construction terribly poor.<br /><br />I took a chance and bought three packs, and couldn't even wear them each once before buying a different boxer. Taking these to Goodwill."
2.0,it is magnetic but the little side buttons came off so i couldn't turn off or use the volume buttons/.
2.0,"This was a lovely lanyard but it frequently unlatched on me and finally unlatched and hit the floor, then broke!  I only had it for about 3 months."
2.0,"Heel broke with a month use. Disappointed. I liked these.<br /><br />In short:<br />— Size: True<br />— Comfort: Good<br />— Style: Great<br />— Quality of fabric (outside): As expected<br />— Quality of fabric (inside): Poor<br />— I would NOT buy again<br />— I would NOT recommend<br /><br />I hope they build a better heel as everything else was good. If it were to be built in the future with a better heel, I would consider buying it again and recommending others to buy it as well."
2.0,My GF is 5'1&#34; and 110 lbs and these squeezed her legs to the point of complete discomfort and didn't look good. I'm not sure who these are made for if they're too big for her.
2.0,Sizing runs too big.
2.0,"I've gone through several toiletry bags, and this will probably be my last one. No sticky zippers around corners, everything visible and secure. If one of your containers leaks, the damage is contained. If it's not roomy enough for you, get two.<br /><br />Update, January 22, 2017: On my first extended (2-week) use, the top of the bag, where it connects to the hook, ripped wide open. Shoddy design or workmanship. Too bad, since I liked it so much in other respects."
2.0,"It was broke when i got it, the sodder point attaching it to the ring was not attached"
2.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; 178lbs and I prefer a fitted shirt, not too tight but not loose either. A medium worked fine. The only problem is I'm not getting the shirt that I paid for delivered to me. This review comes after a 2nd attempt, but still I get the wrong shirt. Wasting my time! Guess I'm going to the mall now!"
2.0,"Ordered it because I have many backless dresses where the front is low cut. Thought this would be perfect to have a push up affect. It did slightly do that job for me. Not even 10 minutes with it on, the bra kept slipping off until eventually i had to just slide it off. A little bit of sweat and this thing is useless!"
2.0,Very bad quality. I have worn it about 5 times and its already coming apart.
2.0,This shirt was more pinkish than leopard print.  Not exactly what i wanted.  Seems to be stiffer too.
2.0,"The bracelet is very pretty, but started to fade after literally 3 days of wear not submerged in water."
2.0,"Pretty design but if didn't go past my shoulders, weird cut"
2.0,"Strange fit. Twisted all around wrist & you couldn’t see the writing. When trying to adjust it, it bent in a weird way. Too ‘high maintenance’. Returned."
2.0,The fabric is pretty but it's not as long as the model has it ESP if you have hips. I'm pear shaped. 5'7 177 lbs most weight in my thighs and I got an xl. It fit but was snug on the bottom and huge on top. The drawstring helps but not enough for me to love it. I gave it away. The blue is exactly as shown
2.0,"This was purchased for my boyfriend. They were tiny. Definitely meant for women's arms, as it ran incredibly small, and we couldn't buckle the top two. And his forearms aren't even that large. Actually smaller than most men. Also it only comes in a right arm, so if you buy two, you'll have an imperfect match.<br /><br />For the quality, and the fit, and the whole right arm only thing, I'd just splurge in the future and buy a nicer set honestly."
2.0,It’s not oversized. The sleeves are short. Feels cheap. And too noisy
2.0,"Ordered hot pink. They don't look metallic AT ALL. Regular 80's style leggings. Pretty thin material, plan to wear them with shorts or skirt."
2.0,Fast shipping very cheap materials
2.0,"not as shown in pictures , quality not good"
2.0,"Pretty cheap looking, but..it was cheap, so..Lol"
2.0,"Its a cute blouse and a nice color. I am usually a medium but ordered a large because of the reviews and it was still small. The material kinda stuck to me, too."
2.0,"I found the purse to be to flimsy for me. It was a very nice looking purse but just wouldn't work for me,"
2.0,It DID NOT come with the stud!!! So misleading
2.0,If the shield would actually sit on my neck I would give this five stars. The whole apparatus flip backward at any given opportunity
2.0,The dress is beautiful but is not true to size. I will need to send it back.
2.0,The pants were the right size just short in length.
2.0,"Overall the quality of the shirt is nice. the material is soft and feels great. my biggest complaint is A) the process of getting this set up and B) the awful cost. 30 bucks is what I spend in a concert tee.<br />overall I think they did okay. sleeves are a bit tight, chest area is tight as well. length is about right but I feel after one wash this shirt is done for. it also seems the shirt is lower in the front than the back almost like it was cut an an angle. honestly would not buy another one. the overall fit just feels ""off"""
2.0,The only issue I had was it looked faded. The  material was stretching however it looked a little little discolored
2.0,these were smaller than i was expecting
2.0,Too sloppy looking for me
2.0,"Ordered three dresses. Three of the same dress, same order. One is different mint color🙄 Wedding is the 30th. Can’t get a hold of Andybridal…."
2.0,"Lovely color but huge. I was hoping the medium would be small enough but definitely not. I'm 5'4&#34;, 115lbs and I was swimming in it."
2.0,"Not warm at all, not constructed well. Seams started coming apart after about a month. They look nice though."
2.0,The material was soft and I like the color but I did not like the fit. Maybe because I’m curvy but it did not fit well. It is very long and a straight fit so was not flattering at all.
2.0,"Very uncomfortable to wear, it has a underwear attachment underneath that you close but it was way too uncomfortable, and if you don’t close it the hooks will get hooked on the slip and scratch whatever skin is by it. I only wore it twice and then decided I could not wear it anymore."
2.0,Not really as seen in picture !
2.0,The fabric itself is nice but it FIT TERRIBLY! I put on the pants and they were extremely baggy at the bottom and wouldn't zip at the top. The second belt loop (the one to go around the waist) also was not even in the package! I was so excited to get this cosplay but trying it on the day before the con and feeling like I'm suffocating even though the size measurements were the same as used for my last cosplay (which fit like a glove.) I'll probably end up sending this costume back to be honest.
2.0,"This dress would be flattering on someone whose not petite or short. I ordered a Medium and the top fit fine, but the length was too long. The ruching section of the dress goes to low on a petite person like my self whose 5ft, it just looks off. The material is not bad but its not luxurious. It looks more casual than what the picture depicts."
2.0,The robes are beautiful and seem luxurious save for the foul musty stench that overwhelms you when you open the package. Buyer beware
2.0,Doesn't look as well as the picture
2.0,I would guess this shirt comes via Ali Express - in accommodation with the PRC’s One Belt One Road plan.
2.0,"Poor quality, print/design is crooked<br />Should check quality before shipping"
2.0,So disappointed in sizing. It was NOT XL.
2.0,Way too tight for bust yet all other area were large.  I have found this to be on just about every dress that is made in China.  Make sure you go with your bust measurements.  Material was also poor quality.  Will say that shipping was great.
2.0,Cut to small you can see her chest. Cute but don't like the fit.
2.0,This is very different than one I purchased before. It looks matted to me.
2.0,Material was too thin. Returned.
2.0,"The shoes fit well, however these are absolutely, positively, not a deep burgundy as pictured. They are HOT PINK! Very dissatisfied. I bought these for an event that I purchased matching accessories and a bag to match and I couldn't wear th because I had nothing to match them. False advertising, but hey for $13 I'll keep them.. it costs way more to send back."
2.0,Not the greatest material or construction
2.0,This was clingy in weird places and then too big and heavy on the top.  And it cut very strangely across the chest.  I returned it.
2.0,The quality was so so.
2.0,Took a really long time to come.  Material is thin and fits a bit small.
2.0,"This cover up looked so cute in the pic, but is WAY TOO BIG!! Looks like I'm wearing a sheet."
2.0,"Horribly disappointed. I always check the size charts before purchasing and the size chart for this top was the most inaccurate representation I’ve encountered on Amazon. Not only is it several sizes too large, it’s also quite a bit different in regards to length than shown in the photo. It comes down to my knees, and I’m 5’8”. If the fit were more accurate I’d be able to make it work, but it’s just unflattering. And even more disappointing is the color that I ordered is out of stock in every size but the one I purchased. The fabric itself is alright; it’s a bit cheap feeling but it could skim over imperfections if it didn’t fit like a tent."
2.0,Material is cheap quality. The foldings do not stay in place.
2.0,"The dress is pretty and fits but the fabric is weird! It would be perfect is a cotton mix, this feels more like a plastic like raincoat fabric, as soon as you put it on it makes you hot and sweaty. Too bad, would be amazing in cotton"
2.0,the bow slipped out of the snot part after wearing for a couple hours. Slipped it right back in but this just tells me the quality isn't great
2.0,"disappointed with this item. color was not a light mint color as ordered, it was certainly dull and darker than shown. I ordered a size up and still cannot wear as a dress."
2.0,"These &#34;jeggings&#34; are more like very thin dark jean-colored leggings. They are almost see-through in spots, which is not what I was looking for, and are not of very good quality."
2.0,Ok pants but not worth the price. I bought $19.95 Columbia traveling pant that was much better.
2.0,"Could not find a way to contact the seller. I tried to do return for both pairs of plants but my reason for return was not listed. I ordered 2 pair of size 2X. I received 2 pair that say 2X, but they are not 2X. I have ordered for years from many places and never had pants marked 2X and not fit. These are for a size 12 or 14 person not a 2X person. I would like to return them or get a refund because I cannot use them at all."
2.0,Cute boots like the floral pattern.way to narrow.instep is tight.tried loosening lases all the way down.still no give to material.tight.long enough but just too narrow and instep tight.not like original dr martens.I think these are fake.
2.0,Looks cheap. Didnt like and sent bacl...return process was painless.
2.0,The fabric was extremely see through and cheap. I mean for the price I suppose I can’t complain but I’ll just be using it as a bathing suit cover up.
2.0,"It was too big, I think."
2.0,"so imagine that a teacher gave the students the assignment of making this shirt for their first project. So you will basically get a diy version of the shirt shown... Its was a nice look, but for a little under 5 buck i dont think ill feel confident wearing it out. Maybe round the house or to workout. I might just diy some decals for it just to use it up and practice designs.. I am 5'4 and 150 lbs and i ordered an XL. Its not as long as pictures. The sid bar should be tighter and slimmer. It just looks like u have another black shirt under, not a band. The back might be off center? Maybe thats just me. I rather have my money back and put it towards something that i love. I do like the collar. Just want a higher quality piece, even for a higher price."
2.0,I had to return these they were way too small :(
2.0,Color is not as good as shown in the picture
2.0,"How these leggings have such good reviews is beyond me. The first time I put these on I sat down and my 11 month old daughter crawled across my lap and somehow they got a run in them. On top of that they are ridiculously see through. Do not even waste your money.<br />I will say that they are super comfortable, but they're not even worth the money for pajamas. Just pass these by."
2.0,The fame is not as shown in the preview picture there is a bar separating the two lenses. They are relatively comfortable but scratch WAY too easy
2.0,Cheap quality. Three of them broke within the first week of having them.
2.0,size runs super small than what it is
2.0,"The ring itself is beautiful, and I received many compliments on it, but within two weeks I list three stones."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:aab47ce26a0b4c02f9ed8b4bb9650e4c]] the fact that it's not real does not really bother me, but the size of the post is too big, it stretches your hole a lot. i could not wear it for more than 20 minutes. check video for visual"
2.0,"Way too small, should be labeled as kids.  My daughter likes them though."
2.0,"I was very excited upon receiving these - I am 5'3"" and 115lbs and the small fit perfectly if you are looking for a relaxed, comfortable fit. Unfortunately, the first time I tried to wear this the buttons on the straps BOTH popped off.  I'm so disappointed because I really did like these! Be gentle and careful if you purchase!"
2.0,"Very poor quality. Material defects, Sent it back"
2.0,I loved this outfit but it was to small. I even ordered two sizes up and it still didn't fit. The material was cheap but I expected as much since it is a costume but I wasn't impressed.
2.0,Hurts me feet. I'm an 11 and it fits like a 10.
2.0,The waist is almost up to the boobs. Very pretty
2.0,"When I actually got the dress, it did not look anything like the picture-it was short sleeved lace with a tule skirt.  The zipper sucked but it was still a nice dress.  I'm lucky I still like it, but that was very dishonest of the company"
2.0,Color nothing like the picture.  Gave an extra star because arrived on time.
2.0,"Mittens are great, hat fits like it isn't cut directional for the face"
2.0,"I like this bag. The size is perfect and there are lots of pockets. However, the nylon strap started to shred the first day the I used it and it has continued to get worse."
2.0,"One pair broke the first time I put them on. Small earrings are fine, big ones really pinch the ears."
2.0,This suit is poorly designed and doesn't fit well. The straps are too loose and don't adjust enough. The design itself is just weird. It looks different from the picture. I'm keeping it because I had a coupon code and only paid $7. Otherwise I'd return it. Giving it 2 stars only because I think I may be able to re-sew the straps myself and get a little use out of it. And it was only $7.
2.0,Waist is very tight elastic and it gets uncomfortable after wearing them awhile.
2.0,The material is see through. So I guess I will wear it to the beach some day.
2.0,Its pretty but the sring came undone and the stones at the adjustments part broke in half from wearing it for a short amount of time.
2.0,It’s cheap. As others say:<br />• it’s see through if you stretch it at all.<br />•The print is upside down on the front; it is the right direction on the upper back part only<br />•it’s the quality of a cheap costume; not an article of clothing<br />•Overpriced. I feel like I overpaid and would not purchase again.
2.0,The pockets make your hips look wide. Ordered a medium and I’m average size 8 but my hips and butt looked too tight in the green. Black looked fine.
2.0,"The description said knee high soccer socks, these barely came up to mid shin on our 5th grade basketball team. the socks themselves are very cute, but size wise, not happy with"
2.0,It was really thin
2.0,The product looks like a Native shoe in the picture but when you get the shoe is is not.  The material it is made from is not great and it fits very snuggly.  It does not stretch very well to help with putting on the shoe.
2.0,"Love the design but runs small.  I had a hard time getting the dress on despite the side zipper on the right side of the bodice.  I ordered a size XL (normally would order an L) and the top was way too tight.  I am small busted and I felt like I was busting out of it.  The dress is cute and perfect for summer, just the fitting need to be more in line with the size."
2.0,"Thin and cheap, not worth the price"
2.0,"too big, too square. had promise tho"
2.0,"Cheap plastic, broke almost half of the poles trying to assemble it! Pretty sad, but taped it together and made one of them work for Halloween"
2.0,"Where to start.. this dress is very deceiving. 1. Looks like it’ll be tight up to your hips, but it’s not. It might be tight at the rib cage and that is it. 2. This dress didn’t come with any sort of material to tie the back with. Yet it’s a lace up back? Doesn’t make sense. 3. If you have bigger boobs, this dress will not work. I’m a size 4 but my chest is more toward a size 8. I was hoping with it being lace back and adjustable straps it would be fined but again was let down. The picture makes this dress look soooo much better than in person. The only reason my picture looks decent is because of angle and the fact I had a death grip on the back of the dress. Not to mention, mine didn’t have a slit in the leg. Make it make sense."
2.0,Expected the manufacturer name to produce finer workmanship for this product.
2.0,Doesn’t have the feel of a well put together item. Color is excellent
2.0,was great for about 2month. right now the leather rins that holds the srap are getting ripped.
2.0,"Disappointed in this item, and the delivery from seller was terrible. Over with item and seller I am not happy at all."
2.0,"I usually wear XL, so I ordered these 2X,  but these feel just as tight as an L size."
2.0,The bodice fits very awkwadly. Uncomfortable.
2.0,"Wayyyyy to small. I was able to get a half refund which is better than nothing so I do appreciate that. This shirt, however, was much shorter and tighter than the picture."
2.0,"Suitable for times when a nice pair of sunnies would be dumb. The are okay, lightweight, but scratched very easily."
2.0,"I was ready to wear it, but I was disappointed when I tried it on because the zipper broke when I tried to zip it up. It wasn't sturdy."
2.0,very small cheaply made stitching coming apart after two weeks. it is cute for a tiny bag and I do like the color.
2.0,"This band was too long for my 165mm wrist.  The end of the band was wrapped completely around and the end was past the magnets.  This caused the end of the band to flap around.  The description says that it will fit 140mm to 210mm wrist size.  Based on what I saw, I believe your wrist size would need to be at least 175mm for this strap to fit."
2.0,My son loves the shoes. But they only lasted about 6 weeks
2.0,Didn't last long before they broke. Lens popped out and the other one cracked.
2.0,zip so bad :(
2.0,The fabric was very flimsy and clingy and was very wrinkled!
2.0,Didn't make that much of a difference using these at night for driving.
2.0,"I had bought this primarily because of fabric content. This was definitely not rayon as advertised. In fact, the tag in the garment says 100% polyester. For me, this was a major disappointment because I can't easily wear polyester...it has an adverse reaction for me. The caftan has a lot of room in it. I am 5'10 and find it quite roomy...just can't wear it for too long. It is inexpensively made, for the price, I had expected it. For a quick coverup and if you don't mind the fabric content, it is just fine. For me, it doesn't work."
2.0,Too small than age listed. Buy a size up.
2.0,These are cool shades for a little dude but my 4-year old broke these on day 2. He popped the arm right off. These are the first pair he's ever broken too and I was shocked since they are rubberized frames.
2.0,The jacket didn't come with the bag to pack the PACKABLE jacket. I NEEDED this jacket to pack down since I am backpacking through Europe and need to save space. I cannot send it back and it was a waste to me.
2.0,Fits fine except the back is super weird. It sticks out and you can see into the back and see the underwear. Also the color was normal denim instead of the color I ordered.
2.0,"El color no es rojo como en la foto, es muy claro.  Peso 145 libras, lo cogi large y llegó muy ajustada."
2.0,It broke the second I wore it !
2.0,"Jacket is fine, more like a heavy sweater, but sizing (XXL) was well below reg XXL stuff"
2.0,"Product looked nice, but was way too small.  Be sure to order a size or two larger when ordering."
2.0,Light weight but The material is too hard.
2.0,"Slippers lasted one month.  At one month almost to the day, the rubber sole on one of the slippers started falling off.  All of the stitching came completely undone.  Will not buy again."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this top.  I like the color and design, but it is not even close to being a tunic.  I'm 5'9 and regularly buy tunic tops to use as regular length tops.  This top didn't even come to my hips."
2.0,RETURNED THIS DRESS BECAUSE IT WAS TOO BIG.
2.0,"Love this, however had to fix when I got it. Came broken."
2.0,The nose piece was broke off when I received them.
2.0,"Thin, smelled of mildew."
2.0,"Although these shorts are cute, the sizing is terrible. No where close to where it should be"
2.0,The material was not as expected. More light and stretchy than heavy. White was also closer to cream. Doesn't have a flowing effect
2.0,This coat runs small and is not the color as advertised. It's more of a peachy color. Super disappointed with this item.
2.0,This looks MUCH better in the photo. The actual shirt is just a plain boring racer back tank. It is not nearly as colorful or fitted as it appears in this picture.
2.0,"IDK what kind of human was supposed to wear this, but the pants were very uncomfortable and would not fit right. My daughter wore them once and took them off and threw them away. She likes the shirt, so I'll give it two stars. But the only reason I bought it was because of the matching outfit/print."
2.0,"flimsy material...too thin for my taste...one should was not completely sewn, not meant for true pear shape ...Im much smaller on top, heavy bottom.. returned"
2.0,"I like the material and the quality of these shirts.  Two of the three that arrived have spots/stains on them, as if they were used by someone, then returned, then reshipped to me.  Also, the Small size that I bought fit large on me even though I used the size chart to try to match my size."
2.0,the color was faded before it was even washed. I now just wear the pants around the house when cleaning or painting because they are comfortable but can't wear them outside because they looked terribly old and faded from day one.
2.0,Awkward to use. Not a great color.
2.0,Very bulky and hard to get on.
2.0,It fit fine but unfortunately I did not like the material.
2.0,Cheap looking and I’d give it to a young child it’s certainly not much for a lady.
2.0,I didn't like this jacket
2.0,I really don't like this bra at all It fits very oddly and as a result is very uncomfortable<br />.
2.0,"Ok this swim suit is super cute but unfortunately the sizing is off. I bought a large thinking it would fit me due to the size chart. I am a 34/36 C depending on bras, but the cup size for the bathing suit was literally an A cup, my sister even tried it on and she is a B cup and still runs too small for people with a little more in the chest. I was very disappointed in this purchase and the off sizing. Didn't bother trying on the bottoms since the reason I purchased the bathing suit in the first place was for the top part."
2.0,I returned this dress
2.0,Cheaply made. I should have known better.
2.0,The socks are too small
2.0,"Looks so cheap, I’d be embarrassed to give it to anyone. Glue spots near the clasp on the “stones” and matching peeled spots on the pleather. Jut looks sloppy"
2.0,I was super excited to find these after researching many. I didnt get to wear them long. Around my 5th month my piercing began to get red and irritated and had to be removed.
2.0,They're cute but kinda tight and see through by the toes. Some even ripped right after I got them and I have pretty small feet (size 6 in women's). Probably wouldn't recommend them
2.0,i was disaapointed at how awkward it was the back was such a weird length it doesnt fit like youd expect.
2.0,"Unfortunately, the bass clad broke off the rest of the cufflink after wearing them normally three times, and one half got lost when they popped apart. I couldn't say if my pair was a defective exception to the rule or not."
2.0,I typically wear larges and saw reviews of this being too big so I got a Medium. I feel like they mislabeled it since it definitional fits like an XXL size
2.0,"Update: it’s been about 2 months since my 5-star review. The chain that it’s attached to comes un-done SUPER easily. It’s slipped off 3 times without me even knowing. And wouldn’t you know it, it’s lost after merely two months. You would have to find something else to attach it by."
2.0,"These are more like shoes than slippers.  No cushioning inside at all.  So if you're looking for soft, cozy, or fuzzy slippers, do not buy these!  Also, the fit was very small."
2.0,"They do not stay up that well, and don't stay up at all when the filter is inserted. The fabric is comfortable though."
2.0,Disappointed in quality......
2.0,BROKE RIGHT AWAY
2.0,"It’s cute but it just looks and feels cheaply made. Obviously you get what you pay for. The belt is not a different fabric—it’s like they cut a strip off the dress and used that as the belt. I think with the right accessories, like some gold bangles, pretty sandals, and a big floppy hat...you’d look great probably. But the reality is that the material itself is just plain t shirt material. And low quality t shirt material at that."
2.0,"Not impressed with this product at all! These are SO cheap looking! I mean they were a good price but if you’re looking for jewelery that’s even acceptable to wear out of the house, do not get these. These are more of kids costume jewelery. I did give it two stars rather than one because the colors are cute and the idea is there, the product is just not of quality at all. I will not be wearing these but I suspect they would cause earlobes to turn green or get infected."
2.0,They are cute but break easily and stab into your ears
2.0,"It feels so comfortable but when you wear it around, my left side socks always comes off from the heel. So not so happy with the quality"
2.0,The interior lining has separated from the case. It was like this immediately upon opening the package. It’s not worth the hassle to return so I may try to fix it with glue myself.
2.0,The color is beautiful but the holes with it are easy to get caught as well as it’s not suitable for hot weathe with the material. It’s not something you want on you in the sun.
2.0,Fabric is too thin. Although the dress is loose you can see lines of everything under it.
2.0,Had a very noticeable stain on one of the cargo pockets and the diameter of the legs were excessive
2.0,"Seems to keep time and alarms. However, I purchased this particular watch for the vibrating alarm setting, and it does not vibrate. The alarm sound works, but not the vibration."
2.0,"The size chart called for large, but it sits so high on my head, I look like a mushroom! The padding is very hard. It fits my daughter, so I’ll keep it, but otherwise it would go back"
2.0,"They are a cute style and I liked the colors on the two pair I bought but they are over a half size too large. Very large opening at the heel. Also zero arch support.<br />Trying to figure out how to return them. All of these things arrive with zero paperwork now. Another reason for only two stars. Shoes thrown in a box, box thrown in another box with no padding just sliding around loose in larger box."
2.0,"The jacket was cute in style. However, to large was hoping for a shorter look. Studs were cute, one fell off. The big disappointment was thin fabric, long sleeves were short! It was not jean jacket heaviness. I was almost afraid to try it on. Gave it two stars for color & stud arrangement."
2.0,"I wish WISH wish this dress met my standards for cuteness (because i have always loved this style)<br /> and the fabric feels cheap and full of static, wrinkles easy.<br />BUT the worst part is I am 5'9"" and it was the most weird length, hitting at the middle/bottom part of my knee, making it the ""old lady"" length"
2.0,Way too small. Order 3 sizes up. The turquoise material is pretty and the material is nice.
2.0,"*BEWARE: You must be several inches shorter than 6' to be able to wear this snowsuit<br /><br />My partner is 6' tall, 150 lbs, 36-36-39, and this in size Large was absolutely unwearable.<br /><br />The legs are very short and she wasn't able to even raise her arms higher then this or it pulled up very uncomfortably in the seat area.<br /><br />The fabric seemed good and it was sewn together well, with soft cuffs with thumb holes to keep them in place. The zippers all seemed to keep tight and glide easily."
2.0,I ordered these earrings but I received a different pair than was advertised. The clip in the back was different and they did not stay on my ear.
2.0,no me gustó.
2.0,Quality is really good. But it ran much smaller than I expected.
2.0,"If the pants were the correct size, this would be a 5 star review.  Not the greatest suit quality, but what you'd expect from a Spider-man themed suit for 130 bucks.  Unfortunately, even though I ordered a size UP, the pants were still may too tight on my VERY SKINNY son.  Almost unusable.  He still wants to wear it to his prom, so we will try our best to make him not look ridiculous.  I'm pretty disappointed though."
2.0,They don't screw in how they show. They are two large and a bitch to put in.
2.0,To small!  It does not fit my son's Chromebook.
2.0,"The fit on these is weird.  They have no ass, and are baggy in the front.  And before you ask, yes I’m sure I didn’t have them in backwards."
2.0,"This women's top / tee is a nice top, but I'm annoyed that the seller advertised the color I bought as WHITE, when it should be listed as OFF-WHITE or IVORY"
2.0,"Not a good material, looks cheap"
2.0,The beads are dyed and they get on your skin
2.0,"The fabric is a weird slippery shiny polyester, almost like a swim shirt material. I’m not a fan at all. But the printing was nice. It’s also pretty big. I got the small 7/8 for a 7 year old and it’s a pj shirt on her. Overall, wouldn’t recommend because of the fabric."
2.0,The sweater is a nice color and surprisingly matched the photo online. But the hood was way too huge!
2.0,Fits very tight and small. Hurts my Dad’s swelling feet. Although he wears a men’s size 7 these were too tight and small. They don’t go up to middle of his calf either.
2.0,"This fit horribly! I usually wear a medium/large, I ordered a large and it pulls everywhere. The shirt isn't very forgiving and it's stitched around the waist weird. I don't recommend if you have curves."
2.0,It was really pretty.  It just was wide.  I am a bit busty so I ordered a 1x.  I wanted it a bit longer but it was just too wide in the waste area.  Not flattering on me.
2.0,"I ordered one and then my order was canceled. I was so excited because it looked so beautiful and I really wanted one, so I am not happy at all."
2.0,Broke fastly
2.0,Not as warm as I thought it would be.
2.0,"I paid under seven dollars plus $3 shipping for this apron and thought at the time it was a good deal. It looks so cute in the pictures. However, when I received the apron it was very small looking and I ordered an adult size. They had adult and child options. Please see the pictures. The material was very subpar almost like burlap. I bought this as a gift so I didn’t see it before I ordered a second apron in order to make front pockets for my sister. When I looked at both aprons, the second apron is slightly bigger than the first one so I will be using that as the main apron and cutting the pockets out of the first apron. The other thing that happened with this item is that it showed on Amazon as a prime item but I was charged three dollars for shipping from the seller who I believe was in China. When I reported this to Amazon and provided a picture showing the item as a prime item Amazon referred me to the seller to try to get my shipping money back. The seller was not interested in fixing the prime problem or refunding my shipping. If you want a high-quality item, don’t buy this apron. I’m making the best of it but I’m sorry that I did."
2.0,I was expecting casual socks. Dont need to standup to physical training but should be able to comfortably walk in them during the day. These are dress socks that can be work around the house. Super thin material.....slide around in shoes....not comfortable for walking in. As far as cool socks to wear around the house they fall off constantly. I wear a size 12 abd large is supposed to cover up to 13. Might fit better on 10 or 11 size maybe.
2.0,I LOVE THE STYLE BUT WEST BLVD BOOTS ARE NOT TRUE TO SIZE.  TOO SMALL ALWAYS.
2.0,"Bought this for my son who wanted an analog watch.  He can understand the the analog hands by reading the digital display.  The watch is easy to program.  It does have a large face.  It doesn't bother my son, but I feel that it would be too big for me.  The digital display and analog display do not remain synchronized, so about once a month you may need to change one or the other so that they match again.<br /><br />Update 4/16:  With the case being plastic, the springs that hold the wrist strap on can come off fairly easily.  Once that happens, its becomes easier and easier for the band to pop off.  After 4 months, the watch is gone and my son doesn't know where it is.  I would not recommend for a typical boy as I think the wrist strap would break too easily."
2.0,"The design is very cute, just like the picture. But the fabric is sheer and the size small. My 8 year old fits very snug even for a size 10-11. Good thing she is crazy about unicorns and doesn’t mind it because I’m unable to return it."
2.0,This bowling shirt looks good but does not feel good to wear. Very uncomfortable. There is extra material on the inside front of the shirt that just gets in the way. It seems like that should have been trimmed back or something.
2.0,"Played the cheshire cat in a stage production of Alice and Wonderland. The fur coverings for the hands, feet and head were awful, so I painted my face and bought a set of ears. The costume is extremely large and I had to pin it in several places. I do not recommend this costume for a woman, but if you're in pinch and need to be a cheshire cat FAST, then it works alright."
2.0,"The dress idea is cool but the fabric is super thin and cheap looking. Had to return. Not a terrible item, just not what I exspected for the price."
2.0,I love the color and pattern but unhappy with the bra padding. My breast do not sit that high and the padding made me look like I have quadruple boobs 🤣<br />I think I could cut them out but I’m pregnant and have sensitive nipples. I need some padding if I’m going into the water. Bottoms were a little tight and not as comfortable as I would have liked so I am  returning.<br /><br />For reference I am 5’8”- 182 pounds and five months pregnant. I got the largest size (XXL).
2.0,When received it had stains on the front of the shirt poor quality
2.0,"The material was very thick and felt weird, almost like felt... Was not flowy like I thought the picture looked.<br />Not very breathable... I'm hot natured so I didn't want to sweat all night... had to send it back :("
2.0,"This item was not as it appeared.  The gloves did not have the three tucks on the back of the hand, and did not button as pictured.  The fit was odd, as if the thumb were too far back on the glove.  The material is flimsy and cheap."
2.0,Very small glasses. Designed for a child. Not satisfied with this product.
2.0,"Ordered a 12mm rose gold hoop for my septum piercing.  After about a week of wearing it I noticed all the ""rose"" wore off and now it's yellow gold.  Had I known it was going to do that,  I would have ordered silver.<br />Sizing, however,  is perfect!"
2.0,Just got this sticker yesterday and put it on looked great! But...i lost the K when it started raining seems like a cheap product. Will not buy again.
2.0,Not my style. It was too soft so didn't stay in shape.
2.0,"It's good quality socks. Thick, warm and keeps your feet dry.  But if you like thin, this isn't it. It should not be even described as thin hence the 2 stars. It's truly misleading and a waste of money since it's not what I wanted and needed.<br />Need thin ski socks, buy 'Wigwam Women's Snow Whisper Pro Ultra-Lightweight Ultimax Ski Sock' instead."
2.0,"Wore it once and the entire side seam came apart. And no, it was not too tight or stretched out. One tiny loose string unraveled the entire side of the top."
2.0,much smaller than I thought they would be
2.0,They go on super easy but are hard to get off.
2.0,Cheap scratchie material<br />Threads hanging
2.0,"Should have known by the price, super cheap and bends/ folds too easily"
2.0,"Great quality, but sizing was off. Way too small! Even measured myself before purchasing and the size I ordered still didn’t fit. The shirt looks fabulous, but it’s unfortunately heading to the thrift store."
2.0,"Very cheap looking, returned."
2.0,"Shoes arent great and they didnt light up for more than two days, although charged at the same time one would die before the other ... I would say dont waste your money and go get the kids skecher twinkle toes which is what I ended up having to do anyway .... Only giving the two stars beccause shipping was fast and I feel that may be too high of a rating"
2.0,"Like the look, but after 1 wash each sleeve has already lost a seam.  Not a very durable piece of clothing.  Not the quality that i thought it would have been."
2.0,"This dress was well made however it is NOT true to size.  I wear a 10 and ordered a 12 thinking I’d rather it be too big & have it altered.  WRONG!!!  Even the size 12 was at least 2 sizes too small.  On the plus side, the return was quick & easy!!"
2.0,"Runs large. I wear an 10 1/2 - 11 shoe, an XL is very loose. Will return."
2.0,I bought this strap to go along with my coach bag because the original had a thick strap. I only wore the purse three times and the strap broke in the middle of a wedding I was attending.  Embrassed! So I walked out.
2.0,Not so impressed. Super small and the diamond accent that dangles does not hang right.
2.0,Poorly made.  Sleeve holes small enough for a Childs are.  Too short. Still lovely color
2.0,The seams are sloppily joined together and can fray easily.
2.0,"Nice looking socks but did not fit past my calves, way to tight, gave to my daughter instead."
2.0,"I bought these for my sons and nephew.  I thought I was getting a great deal, but I got what I paid for.  2 of 4 popped in a couple of days."
2.0,El precio es muy alto para que dure muy poco tiempo
2.0,"I was very disappointed that this hat runs small. The stone us very cute and I loved the fabric, especially the color (light blue). I have a very average sized head and have never had problems wearing hats, but this one was immediately uncomfortable. I took it off right away. It does have ribbons to adjust the fit, but only to make it smaller; it was already at its largest."
2.0,"I received my bracelet yesterday. It was nicely wrapped and also in a cute gift box.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the bracelet. It looks cheap, feels like it is made out of plastic, and very light weight for the price. Overly priced for the product!!!"
2.0,Got them for my son but he doesn't like them.<br />They don't fit good and lack support. I may return.
2.0,"My spawn likes prints like this.  I don’t know why.  Doesn’t wear it often though because of the cheap, scratchy feeling material"
2.0,I just don't care much for it. Nothing special.
2.0,The color turned
2.0,"I expected a little more heft and thickness to these mittens given the price. They are lovely, just not at all what I expected"
2.0,"Was upset that when I got them, they were broken. It sure they'd have been cute."
2.0,"Bands were nice, but had to switch the band around to get it to fit. Would not fit the normal way. Had to return"
2.0,Much prettier in photo.  The blue accents are plastic.  Overall they are very cheap looking.
2.0,I wanted to like this so badly. The fabric is very comfortable but it definitely doesn’t look like the fabric in the photo. I didn’t check the makeup before buying so that’s on me though. What didn’t work was that the buttons were really off center and the neck line kept wanting to twist out. I’m sad I have to return this honestly
2.0,It was my error I order it to small
2.0,"I expected these to be small like studs, but they're pretty big and hang off my ears looking kind of awkward. Not a fan."
2.0,"Really wanted to like these socks. The pattern is great and they are comfortable. However after two uses, seams are coming out, threads are lossening and there is an overall breakdown of quality that is not to be expected from this expensive of a sock. Seriously dissapointed... Two wears!"
2.0,"I should’ve known with this coming from SHEIN that you get what you pay for.<br />Material was just all around very cheap, and a bit see through. Skirt waistline was sewn completely crooked which made it look lopsided while on.<br />Needless to say I returned this outfit."
2.0,"The dress was too small at the top part so I ordered one size bigger and that turned out to be too big.  When I tried to return it I had to pay for postage and that was about the same cost of the dress so I choose to keep it and seller refunded 30% of cost and I kept the dress.  The dress itself is great material good and the make of it is nice but the return policy sucks. I will have to keep the larger one and take it to a semestres, which then adds more cost to the dress.  I would not recommend this item if not sure of your exact size being that seller does not pay for return shipping and then you’ll be stuck with two dresses like me thinking that ordering another one would fit better and it doesn’t!"
2.0,"I wore this shirt 3 times before one of the buttons fell off, if it wasn't for the poor stitching on the buttons I'd give this 4 stars. Very comfortable material, looks exactly as advertised, and fits perfectly."
2.0,See through. Returned it.
2.0,"The floral flats are so cute, but I couldn't keep them because one flat felt bigger than the other. I didn't want to deal with the awkwardness."
2.0,"Will protect against knife and scalpel and length was nice.  However do not fit tight enough so  bagginess hinders your manual dexterity.  Will not protect against puncture wounds from hypodermic needles.  Impossible to clean, everything sticks to the glove"
2.0,TOO TIGHT AROUND MY NECK!
2.0,"Okay, Let me say 1st. You get What you pay for!! Lol So with that in mind. The bracelet is okay. It's like a rose gold color... Not to fond of, Only because the other one I wear on the other ankle is more like an 14k gold colour. 2) I have small ankles & there isn't much chailn left hanging. Good for me, Not so much for women with wider ankles than myself. 3) Although it arrived earlier than the expected delivery date. It took over 3 weeks plus to even arrive... OMG I ALMOST FORGOT THE BEST PART!! MY HEART IS SIDE WAYS. SOOO, It's definitely not quite what tge picture is advertising.. Now may be it's just mine.. I'm not sure.. Lastly, The 2 chains won't stay seperated, Like the pic.. Overall. I wouldn't suggest nor recommend this....even for the low cost of $2 plush shipping"
2.0,"You can't actually see out of these glasses, ergo my return"
2.0,Does not work as well as some I have had.
2.0,Most of these are not Disney pins and some Disney ones don't look legit.
2.0,"Came in with a tear, could not replace without sending then getting a new one and would not get in time for a gift"
2.0,Disappointed that I have to make the charms myself. Definitely misleading
2.0,Bought these for an upcoming trip to Acadia National Park. I normally wear a 14-16 so got an XL. I couldn't even get them all the way on. I would say the XL is an 8-10 at the most. Disappointed and they are going back.
2.0,The 2 stars are for the pattern. I ordered an extra small as that is my size normally and this dress was too big. Totally unflattering in the chest and waist area. Looks like I’m wearing a bag and have no boobs. I am small chested but this makes my chest look bad. So I’d say if you’re normally a small or medium the extra small would probably fit you well.
2.0,"I wear an 8.5 or 9, so that is the size I bought (8.5-9) and they were way too big. I even have wide feet and felt like my feet were swimming in these."
2.0,"Fits good, its pretty much what I wanted and would have given 5 stars except my jacket has an Alaska logo on the front that the picture does not show. Grrrr. Sorry, I don't have pictures of mine, you just have to believe me. Good thing I actually bought this for a trip to Alaska. I'm going to keep it, but I will not buy from this vendor again."
2.0,"This stone color is pretty. However, there are divots all over the top where there is no coating. This is not a stone rather a fabricated plastic or perhaps a resin. I gave it 2 stars for the color which is the reason I bought this ring in the first place. I did return it after contemplating whether the finish would completely flake off leaving a defective appearance."
2.0,"Too bulky and the stone is set badly, cute style but the pictures do not resemble the real item"
2.0,A little smaller than anticipated. Also lacks cleaning instructions in English...
2.0,The shorts are made of very stiff cotton. I wasn’t comfortable wearing them.  Would not buy it again
2.0,The small and medium suitcase couldn't take the trip to Florida.
2.0,Cute but I did not receive hearts on mine
2.0,The design of the ring and size on your finger were bang on but what detracted from it was the color of the stone.  On line it looked very nice but in person it was such a different color of turquoise it wasn’t very believable.  Too bad.
2.0,"I had originally posted that it lost it's color quickly, but now see that that was not true and unjust--I was looking at it at night when I saw that and immediately posted.  When I looked at it in the morning, it looked fine.  Feel bad about that and want to correct that.  It's really a fantastic buy.  I think the reason why we have so many people saying it stays on the glasses and others that it slips off, is because iI've noticed it works differently with different glasses.  Some glasses are so slim, anything would slip off.  Also, you really need to tighten the little rubber hoops by pushing the metal down on it."
2.0,I recieved 4 buckles and sliders but pic shows 2 no sew buttons which is why I bought this item
2.0,It's wouldn't stay on my ear. I lost it within a day.
2.0,The dress is not the same as pictured or described.<br /><br />The dress is much longer than pictured. The two slits are even on both sides and don't even show the knee. The dress goes down to the end of my calves and I'm 5'9. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that the dress actually fit pretty true to size. I'll be returning this dress.
2.0,It arrived broken. The O rings had fallen off and one of the jewels was cracked  I fixed it with pliers and glue.
2.0,"They fit okay, lots of pockets, but they definitely are NOT green at all. They are brown, so I can't wear them to work like I wanted to. I do like the pants though."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:f3d21c94c4d7d76de50611de12ac4c2b]] It’s see through, a stretchy material, and the cups show through the front."
2.0,"The underwear aren't a good material for women's hygiene health, they are not cotton lined.. they get lent and fuzzy after you wash them as well."
2.0,Is not cropped like picture... has no pockets...i returned it
2.0,"This ring is cute, but left me a little disappointed by the finishing. The bezel had a rough gape around the stone, and I needed to use a butter knife to push it into alignment. It still has a visible irregularity, but what can you expect for the price? Oh, and the stone is very dark once it’s on your hand - almost indiscernible as blue. I should have realized that beforehand - my mistake."
2.0,great color but they are baggy and not tight fitting like I'd expected
2.0,The bracelet is beautiful but it is huge!!! No way I can wear it!  The size should be mentioned in the description!
2.0,Tarnished to quick
2.0,A LITTLE BIG
2.0,Stretched frames & flimsy plastic frames. Save your money & check the dollar tree for better quality!
2.0,"The dress itself is very simple but it's what I expected. I am upset because the sizing is way off. I ordered a size a size 3 but it would fit a 5 year old much better. Also, there was no ribbon belt, the bag consists only of the dress, the buckle, and a plant like thing. I'm assuming it's something you thread into their hair. Definitely returning"
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this product but it has left me disappointed. These flipflops are very comfortable but it's achilles heal, so to speak, is the very slippery surface. If the manufacturer fixes this problem WITHOUT hiking up the price (too high already), these flipflops would be recommended."
2.0,"I am 5'7'', size XS/0, waist 25 and ordered the skirt in size S.<br /><br />Fit and color: The fit is way off, huge in the waist (fits like 27'' waist), the slit in the back comes up way too high making the skirt look inappropriate. The color is as pictured but the pattern does not align at seams. The latter may not be an issue for some but I think it looks cheap. The material is not of very high quality either.<br /><br />Summary: Returning this skirt due to odd fit and low quality."
2.0,Mask stays folded so rhe print doesnt show
2.0,"So, I've never worn spanx before. It definitely smoothed things out a bit. The leg area on me was baggy and awkward. I would not recommend this product for daily wear. It's almost impossible to go pee this in!! Will not be wearing again. For me, it was a waste of money."
2.0,This shirt was a weird fit on me. I’m not tall at all and I felt the torso was short. Returned this shirt
2.0,"This dress is true to size. I ordered 4/Small and got it. However, the dress you get is not the dress that is pictured. The fabric is an unwearable synthetic that is fit for tiny foldable begs or lining. It's a tailoring and uneven mess. I do not recommend this dress to anyone!"
2.0,"After less than week the veneer on the toe is flaking away, not a good sign"
2.0,"I love this brand and have lots of dresses in the size I ordered, but it was so small! Great fabric, sad I had to return."
2.0,Me encanto esta muy bonito
2.0,I ordered the white in a medium the top neck piece was cutting into my skin just from trying on and it was too tight i’m 5’5 and weigh 148 had to return cause the skirt was super see through..
2.0,"Loved the texture however, 38D bought XL, fit like a small!!😔"
2.0,Thought it would be longer but short sweater
2.0,definitely fit too large overall. Material is very prone to static cling. made for a longer torso. Polka dots on fabric was bigger than in the photo. returned.
2.0,Tore at the fingertip just taking it off.
2.0,"Generally love these shoes, but believe they made some adjustments between the Launch 4 and 5 that don't work as well with my feet and gait as the Launch 4s."
2.0,It was WAY TOO BIG for my face and there was no way to adjust it. Unfortunate and upsetting.
2.0,"I was expecting a normal type of shirt but this is a very weird looking. The collar is enormous, the sides are very short and the front hangs down low to a sharp point.  Very unflattering fit although I have to say it was soft."
2.0,"I c have swollen ankles and your description made me think they you help. they didn't and made them worse. Cut off circulation and was pure pain by afternoon, Wish I knew this would happen before I ordered. Be careful with description. Do you have ones that just don't cover toes.I have neuropathy so to tight on toes is why ordered yours."
2.0,"I’m under 5’5, and this dress was too short for me to wear in public. I also have a large chest, and this dress only covered about half of it. Fabric was quite thin and see-through."
2.0,Wasn't what I expected it to be.
2.0,I returned the first 2 purchased because they had a small stain. One of the shirts in the replacement has a stain in the same place as the first 2. The shirts a very white so they show every imperfection. I intend to keep the replacements and wear them under another shirt
2.0,"The material is thin, can see through it. Can’t wear a bra with it."
2.0,"Pain to install, and did not stick."
2.0,"If this is actually a mens 4xl I’ll eat it. I normally wear a womens 1x, and I couldn’t even zip it up.  I’m disappointed because it looks great and the material is thick so it was nice and warm. But I couldn’t even zip it."
2.0,too small if you have a normal to wide forefoot
2.0,Too heavy & bulky
2.0,"I got it and about a week later, a link broke, and now the watch face is crooked, and the mechanism won't spin"
2.0,I wore these one time and the snap came completely out. Cheap ( as the price) . Do not recommend.
2.0,the fit was not good
2.0,Delivered with creases in it.
2.0,The shades are much to big for my face frame but unfortunately I cannot exchange now I am at a loss with them
2.0,They were super cute nice material just too short in the torso almost like belly shirts I had to return them.
2.0,White lining really does make it looks cheap and on top of being sent the wrong size I can tell you to order up a size or two
2.0,"Was nicely made,  soft.  cute logo.  purchased XXL for 14 yo, 6'  196 lbs.  Just fit him. I am returning<br />and will order XXXXL especially as it is 50% cotton and I would not put in a dryer."
2.0,"very  cute gift for my granddaughter,  but it broke in just a few days,  poorly made. I was very disappointed"
2.0,My son where's a size 6.  I purchased a size 8 and they are too small
2.0,Very thin and the neck area to the back has a big gap
2.0,"I really like this mask because it's so soft and light weight BUT it's so thin that I question how effective it could be. It's double layered, but I wish it was made so I could slide in a filter. It's not cotton but bamboo. It fits perfectly and has adjustable ear straps as a plus but if you're looking for a mask that's for effectiveness, not just soft and fashionable, I wouldn't recommend this mask. It's just too thin and without a filter and being bamboo....Sure, it's definitely breathable but this mask is for people who are only wearing a mask to get into stores to appease people (for show) but don't really care if it's helping, effective."
2.0,"Ordered what I thought was a bright green lightweight summer dress. Received enormous &#34;moo-moo&#34;  style, poorly constructed, polyester  avocado green dress with drab design. Returning asap! Only &#34;plus&#34; would be that it arrived quickly.... if that's actually a &#34;plus&#34;."
2.0,"Ordered a size up and it was way too big up top and still too small around my hips. Material was what you would expect for a $16 dress. It's cute, but only if you're built like the model."
2.0,I buy a lot of hats. This hat is smaller than average hats. I had to adjust it 2 snaps less than I would normally and the sides are at least 1 1/2 inches above the ear than they should be. It should be marketed as a child's hat.
2.0,Not sure about the quality of the belt.  The 'pin' on the buckle that keeps the belt closed keeps slipping off.  Will be returning this item for a refund.
2.0,"This is an awesome baseball tee style shirt with a great saying! Great material! Thicker type cotton, with a lot of stretch and bounce back. I'm very disappointed because the sizing is WAY off! I normally wear a L or an XL. So, I ordered the XL thinking it would be just fine. Not to mention there are no higher sizes to order. To my dismay it fits like a small or medium. I can barely get it on, and then can't even put my arms down. Says it came from China. So, I'm assuming that's why. I've heard their sizing is like 3 times off from US sizing. Huge bummer, because I was SO excited to get it."
2.0,"Don't get me wrong, these glasses look very decent to say the least; however, they broke the very first day I wore them- one of the legs snapped off when it was inside my bag... unless you're very careful, I'd suggest looking somewhere else."
2.0,Recvd my necklace today & 2 of the pearls were missing .. Other then that it was a good purchase
2.0,"Sizing is way too small , i purchased a L because the sizing chart said it would be 16-18 (I am a 14) and it fit more like a 10. I would order 2 sizes up otherwise the fabric was decent"
2.0,Changes color fast.
2.0,I am red green color blind. I saw absolutely no change in my color vision with these glasses. Very disappointing.
2.0,Sizing was noticeably smaller on the black yoga pant.
2.0,It took a while for it to come in the mail. Once it came we realized the quality was not as good as the photo. And the spelling was incorrect for the name.
2.0,Unflattering at every aspect. Wish I had tried it on earlier so it could be returned.
2.0,"Arrived with a hole in front seam, I should not have to mend a brand new dress..."
2.0,"The Package arrived fine, but my roommate noticed it’s already losing the iron on stickers on the front. It hasn’t been washed and only worn once."
2.0,"This product arrived crammed into a small manila envelope. It was misshapen to the point of being unrecognizable. When I attempted to straighten it out, the whole thing fell apart."
2.0,"to big for my wrist, the watch itself is attractive<br />no other choice but to send it back. good looking watch"
2.0,"The dress is cute, but it didn’t fit me right. Chest area is too small and the dress is too long. I’m 4’11” and 34DDD. This dress is for tall and slim bodies.<br />I tried to return it, USPS told me it was going to cost me $28 to send it back to China, so now I’m stuck with it. So, just be aware of that. If the dress doesn’t fit or is not what you expected you have to pay to send it back, Amazon will not take it back."
2.0,The suit was really cute but there was no stretch on the sides at the chest area. The cups fit ok but it wasn’t tight enough in that area to hold everything in place. It seems short in girth as well. And I’m a stocky 5 foot tall.
2.0,Never fails fits perfect n feels nice.. just one problem..it's very light yellow as not shown. on pic.. which I kinds suspect it to be but not so light lol so close to looking like the color if my Biege wrist band..
2.0,It's good if u want to sweat but it fits awkwardly. Not good for working out in or moving around it. It moves up down left right.
2.0,It made me feel like my chest is awkwardly shaped. It definitely sticks but the cup shape is weird. It just sticked out on certain areas. Had to return it.
2.0,"The bottom of the dress has no true stretch so buckles at the pockets. Just didn't work for me. I bought. 2x and normally wear a 1x, if you're real curvy<br /> all over...  this dress may not work."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f9a2dffe85b760741149a10b48d9dd00]] The functionality of these headbands isn't very good. The purple one is deformed and neither one stay on my head for long. The headband is too weak to support longevity.<br />I rate 2 out of 10! Only looks good but that's it! Wasnt worth $5 each!
2.0,These are pretty flimsy earrings but they are pretty
2.0,Too small if order right size arms and chest too tight if order larger the bottom is way too loose very disappointing since it looked so beautiful in photos and on others but it could just be my build as well
2.0,"Wow talk about terrible sizing! I typically wear a 1x in cardigans, maybe 2x if I want it to be more loose fitting. I ordered a 3x and it barely fits (I’m still considering if I’m going to return it). The fabric is stiff and scratchy. Disappointing!"
2.0,Not compact and not light weight.  Did not close at all....not automatic at all.
2.0,"Realmente no me gusto, no sabia que iba a ser de tan mala calidad, el plastico no tiene el color que se ve en la foto"
2.0,"I agree that this looked more like a night gown when I tried it on than a dress. The print is nice, and I love the pockets, but even the small was just way too big and loose. I am returning it."
2.0,Who has 3 1/2 inch long fingers?  I can’t use the touch pad feature of the gloves because the ends are a full inch longer than my fingers. They are well made and very attractive but if you have average length or shorter fingers you’ll have to keep looking.
2.0,So I ordered these mask to wear to work an one of my coworkers tells me that the Christmas tree on is a pot plant 🤣 if you look closely to the maskyou will see
2.0,"I really wanted to love these shoes. They’re super cute and I think they would be very comfy… if I could get them on my daughter’s foot. Maybe it’s just my kid, but these are impossible to get on. There’s no pull tab in the back to pull them on her heel and since there’s no Velcro or ties of any kind, there’s no way to loosen it. Maybe some up? This is the first slip on shoes I’ve ordered her aside from crocs and it was a bust. I would have returned but I just realized I missed my return window."
2.0,These are the size of children's glasses
2.0,"Very cute and size is right, however it is so short in the torso."
2.0,VERY small and it even shrunk a little with washing.
2.0,"Product was returned, very pretty in pictures however it did not fit that way."
2.0,the scratchy top would not even go over my boobs. I'm 5'6&#34; 140 lbs & wear a 34D. I bought a large.
2.0,"The material is cheap and feels like hay against my skin and because it is so rough, it snags on whatever shirt I choose to layer with it!<br />I would not recommend buying this product."
2.0,"1. item kept coming off watch, but after tightening screws it stayed on.<br />2.I do not have skin issues, but this Band caused skin irritation and cannot use. Band cost $7.98 and the return is $6.03. not worth it to return!!<br />50 50 change it will work for you!"
2.0,These are ok. Got these for a Halloween costume and returned. The printing looks like the picture- but a slightly darker red. The stitching and material isn't the best quality and they fit me pretty weird. I am 5'6 and 145lbs and they were too tight in the legs but bunchy and too big all over the top half which isn't a typical problem for me. Also the stitching in the back and front was crooked and seemed low quality.
2.0,"Waaaaaaaaaay too small. Gave it to a friend of mine that wears an A cup, it was even tight on her."
2.0,"Positives:<br />Fit as expected - usually this style is only available in slim fit.<br />Came with extra buttons in case one gets lost<br /><br />Negatives:<br />The 97% cotton 3% spandex mix is somehow incredibly stiff feeling<br />Wrinkle galore - followed the instructions, pulled this straight out of dryer, and it was a complete mess of wrinkles.  Tried ironing it, but then assumed I must have washed it wrong somehow, based on the stiff feel of the material and the amount of wrinkles.  Washed it a second time, being sure I was following instructions to the letter, but it still came out a wrinkles mess.<br />Color fading after two washes - after a second wash, colors were visibly fading and washed out on all edges and seams.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend this one."
2.0,"I wear 11N and the width and length are appropriate.  Heel and sole are great. Fairly attractive.  However the thin flimsy nature of the shoe top covering the foot does not lay flat on your foot.  It crinkles and doesn't look at all like the picture.  Might work for a wider foot?  Also, quite tight to put on, but that is expected given the design of the shoe."
2.0,It fits weird. I didnt like the material.
2.0,"Between summer and winter I buy a dozen or more shirts, all large. This is the only shirt I've purchased in a size large that doesn't fit me. I ended up giving this shirt to a smaller relative that normally wears a medium."
2.0,"Cute, but this brooch doesn't stay closed."
2.0,"The dress is comfortable, but totally see through. I wore this for family pictures and although the waist is flattering it sits poorly on the love handle area."
2.0,Very disappointed. The coloring of the plastic heart is beautiful but that is where this bargain begins and ends.<br />Don't know what I was expecting for $12 U.S. dollars. Certainly a little more than a 50¢ bubble gum machine piece of jewelry.<br />Lesson learned. Hope nobody is offended. The review is not aimed personally towards any individual in any form or matter!
2.0,They fit true to size but they are VERY thin I can't really even wear them because you can see right through them.
2.0,the rubber band break to easy
2.0,Waste of money after a wash it faded and got lil fuzz balls.
2.0,I ordered a small and although you can tie it to fit your wait the dress is sewn just like a curvy hourglass figure with hips and it does not fit mine. Would be gorgeous on a more voluptuous woman just like the picture model
2.0,Combining the light button with other functions (e.g. time setting) is confusing and a poor design choice.
2.0,"DON'T DO IT! It's cheap and sad. I didn't trust the reviews either, but they were right. It doesn't fit true to size or the chart. It it cheaply made and poorly structured. You can live your life however you choose. But please, let this be one lesson you don't have to learn the hard way!"
2.0,I washed this dress in cold water on delicate wash and it shrunk so now it fits really weird. The construction is very crude but the price is justified to wear it only once and throw it away.
2.0,This was too wide and heavy for me so I returned it. It looked very nice though.
2.0,"The bullet points description at top of the page says: 65% Cotton, 35% cotton Spandex and also ""Machine wash warm, Do not bleach, Tumble dry low, Do Not Dry Clean""  but the tag on the top says ""100% Acrylic"" and ""Professional Dry Clean Recommended""  If this matters to you - best to find something else."
2.0,These hose were used to help with swelling of my ankles on a flight to and from Australia.  After the first use they ran.  Not happy with the quality.  Would like a replacement
2.0,I was disappointed in this bracelet. The writing was too small to read.<br />The band should be wider to allow for larger letters.
2.0,It feels cheap.
2.0,Looks cheap & runs small but cute & cool.
2.0,This would only be suited for a child - the diameter for the neck area is incredibly small. Would not recommend for adults.
2.0,The fit was pretty good and they were soft.  And fairly heavy weight.  But they were not fleece lined.
2.0,Broke apart after wearing it for 3 days
2.0,"The first time I went to wear it, the necklace broke so I Kept the earrings and tossed the necklace.  I didn't return it because I'd thrown away the packaging and for what I paid it wasn't worth driving across town to UPS store.  I loved the look of it and hated that it broke."
2.0,"Purchased near the end of September and had ripped by mid December. The fabric for the outside of the bag is nice quality, but the fabric for the inside/pockets is cheap and thin.  The first picket that ripped only had light things inside of it.  Overall I like the features, but they need to upgrade the fabric choices so it can last longer."
2.0,"Look cute, comfortable, but will break over and over easily"
2.0,"I ordered this bag to carry on an overseas trip. I loved it - a plethora of pockets including a hidden one that I used for my passport, a cell phone pocket and one that accommodates a small water bottle and several others. The center part of the bag is divided into two roomy compartments.  Now for the 'but'.  Three days into the trip I was walking down Tottenham Court Road and the strap tore away from the body of the purse. So for the next 5 days, I wandered around London with very large, very obvious safety pins holding the purse together. It is a given that if you have a purse this big, it is a given that you are going to put stuff in it - the bigger the purse, the more stuff.  The the strap was attached with a single row or regular stitching appropriate for a hem, but not for something that will weigh more than a few ounces.  I do find the purse worth repairing - and I'm going to have the strap attachments heavily reinforced. But I shouldn't have to. The purse should have had the strap attachments strongly sewn on.  So if you do buy this purse, find someone who can reinforce the strap attachment before you put anything in the purse."
2.0,Not great quality. Haven't even worn it
2.0,Hat was too small for an adult head and would not stay on easily.
2.0,I was very impressed with these sunglasses for the low price. They are very lightweight and the polarization is great. My husband has been using them for fishing and he can definitely see more things in the water than I can with my non-polarized glasses. I’m actually thinking of ordering a pair for myself at this price.<br /><br />I am updating my review because these lasted 1 summer and the lenses started to peel apart
2.0,I gave it 2 stars because it's pretty. But there's songs are plastic and for what I I for it. I expected something was up.buyer beware you get what you pay for.
2.0,Son lindos pero se descocen el cuello facil y no ajustan tanto
2.0,The elastic is puckered making it fit weird
2.0,I bought this for my son for a dress up day at school but when it arrived it wouldn’t light up. I went to check the battery back and one of the wires from the pack just slid right out like it wasn’t even connected. Very disappointed. It would have been really cute!
2.0,Runs very small. Couldn’t return because it was “used” since it was attempted to put on.
2.0,"There is a seam right along your butt crack; it feels like a wedgie, but it is not. The legs ride up. Better as a PJ  bottom than wearing underneath pants or shorts, because the pseudo-wedg and legs riding up."
2.0,"Be careful and look closely at the pictures. I searched for Casio watches and was presented this as one of the options. If you look closely at the pictures, you will see that the logo on the face of the watch is blurred. IT IS NOT A CASIO.<br /><br />Shipping was great; it arrived as expected.<br /><br />I will update my review shortly based on how it performs."
2.0,I had to give them to my 13 year old because they were too small for me.
2.0,This hot pink too is cute but had to return product because it is not as described the back to the shirt was not at all crisscross in the back it's just like a regular spaghetti strap top and that's the whole reason I bought the top was because of crisscross
2.0,Boots almost look black and they run to big
2.0,"These are much shorter than shown, barely coming to the top of the hip. Otherwise, the size is pretty spot on."
2.0,The structure is odd not that comfy. after the first wash the thread unraveled at the collar and now there is a hole. Wish i spent a little more on a better quality jacket. Heck i wish i could return it. :(
2.0,"Looks nice. Fits watch. Clasp doesn't stay fastened and several times a day I have to stop the watch from falling off. Too bad, I really liked it and planned on buying a black one. I've gone back to my G-Shock."
2.0,Earringswith coloring faded quickly...the stainless steel ones are fine.  Should have just ordered a set of those instead of wasting money on a multi-colered selection that did not sustain color well.
2.0,"These were well made, but they were inconsistent. I bought three different colors at the same time (why did I do that?). What I found was that some were sewn with the pearl side out and some were sewn with the knit side out. I hated the feel of the pearl on the outside. The fabric wasn't slippery like I wanted, lots of drag. The fabric seemed exactly the same though, as though when being sewn, they just assembled it wrong side out. One of the colors was right though, and I think it was the one I didn't like as much, go figure.<br /><br />Regardless, these were't what I was looking for. I was looking for light-weight breathable leggings. These are heavy and seal you up and make you sweat. Very slimming though."
2.0,i ordered two sizes larger and this item still did not fit.
2.0,"Too tight, didn’t love the material"
2.0,"Not great quality. It was also very scratchy on the waist, and the material was cheap. Don't waste your money."
2.0,Thin socks and lots of strings inside. Disappointed with fit and comfort.
2.0,"The fabric is very soft but I should have read reviews. It's WAY small. I ordered 3x which I'm normally between 2x and 3x, depending on brand. I took one look and knew that's never gonna fit. It looks like a large. Going to have to give it away."
2.0,"In the pic, that sleeve is not pulled up. One is considerably shorter than the other.<br /><br />I also don’t like the print. Very mottled. I think I’ll keep them and layer over them but won’t wear just these shirts in public. I don’t plan to wear the purple one ever. Too weird with that one short sleeve.<br /><br />I ordered a medium and they are shorter and tighter than I like. I’m usually a small."
2.0,"These are beautiful earrings, but one broke IMMEDIATELY after i got them, didn’t even get to put them on. The wire is very delicate and they were tightly curled when received so i tried to open them enough to put them on my ear, and it snapped."
2.0,"This is well made... solid fabric and good stitching.<br /><br />However, the slips for cards and spaces for money are wayyy too tight to use without owning it for a long while and maybe breaking it in eventually.  New it's a struggle to get the items both in and out.<br /><br />The only really good bit to its make beyond the quality of it's making is that the pouch for passport space is very roomy.  Everything else is tight as all heck, but that's a bit soft pocket that could hold a couple and maybe some other small objects.<br /><br />Unusable for me. I'd not suggest it."
2.0,"I have a larger bust, and I couldn’t get it to zip. It’s a very small zipper to hold onto."
2.0,No me ha llegado
2.0,I ordered a 1X/2xl....I am 5 foot 7and weigh 160 pounds The jeggings are cute but they ran too small 😕1 ended up giving them to my 12-year-old daughter!
2.0,The bottoms were WAY too tight but the top was not fitting. It was fitting More like the actual size rather than fitting smaller like it said. I bought a large and the bottoms were digging into my hips and legs but the top was too loose. I wish I could order a smaller top and larger bottoms
2.0,Cheaply made. Broke in first use.
2.0,I just pulled received it today and pulled it out of the package and the tassel was already broken. :( It was perfect otherwise and the color/style was exactly what I was looking for.
2.0,"The snake was too big, and the bar was too small. It didn’t fit my ear only one side went in because of the size of the snake. If the snake was smaller it would have been perfect."
2.0,Lens weren't pink like shown and they fell apart 3 days after I got them!
2.0,"This wallet is somewhat good quality but it doesn’t sparkle/glow in the sunlight or light  like it advertises. The wallet itself is big but doesn’t really fit my credit cards in the card slot. The card slots are too tight.  Was thinking of buying a bag but after this wallet, I’m not going to do that. I miles well just buy it from the name brand itself."
2.0,Dosnt show in the pics its got stuff on the back too
2.0,incorrect measurments of chain i wear 16in and on would not even  go half way.so now afraid to but ant more of chains..
2.0,Thinner than I thought. The socks are Not high if you have bigger feet. Didn’t seem like boot sock quality.
2.0,"This ring may be very durable, but it looks NOTHING like their pictures! I went with the silver because they make it look like it will be shiny looking, or at least bright. This ring is a very dull Gray and looks almost worn out from wear before you even put it on. I liked  the last set of rings I bought from Rinfit since they looked exactly as advertised, so I believed they were a straightforward company with what they sold. I was incorrect. Trust me! If you order this product you will be disappointed as well, unless you don’t care that it looks run down! If I would’ve known this, I would’ve at least bought a fun bright color. Very disappointed!!"
2.0,"I purchased this Babyku satin sleep cap because it said EXTRA LONG  and I have long lot’s nope, it’s not for long hair, it’s cheaply constructed, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I liked the design pattern. I would not buy again."
2.0,"Updated: I am taking my original review from 5 stars down to 2.  I contacted the seller to see if a smaller size could be purchased or an exchange. I wore it for 20 minutes and the top part stretched out to the point I cannot even wear it. It fit perfectly for 20 minutes. It has now been almost 2 weeks and the seller has not communicated.<br /><br />bought this dress with every intention of having to return it due to these types of dresses never fit me right. But I did not have to return it. It is PERFECT! The fit is amazing and so comfortable. The design is flattering and makes you feel beautiful. I am normally a size 10/12, 36G bra size and I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly in all the right places as well as the length was just right ( I am 5'6). This is my favorite dress and I hope they come out with a lot more colors besides blue and black. Just order this dress, you will not be disappointed!"
2.0,Fit perfectly but armits are weirdly stretched out. Returned.
2.0,runs small and the fabric is real cheap and thin. i had these about 3 months before they ripped
2.0,"It's a very beautiful dress, but it was way smaller than descibed."
2.0,"The gold coloring makes the necklace seem cheap, even thought the quality isn't too bad."
2.0,The product works as described but the fact that it does not go over the calf the sock continues to slide down where it  actually looks like I'm not wearing any socks.  I would not recommend this product unless the style changes.
2.0,Way too small for the size!
2.0,The hat is warm and has thickness to it. But not much stretch to it.(Tight) the scarf in very thin and cheap looking. And the mitten are thin too.
2.0,Wow. I ordered a 3X because I like my PJs baggy. I can't even get these over my hips.<br />They are light weight and perfect for summer so I'll give them to my sister. Should have read the reviews but at least they were cheap :(
2.0,"Cute styles but not the quality mentioned. My ear turned green, the metal changed color. Good for cheap stuff, not worth long term use."
2.0,"Disappointed in the fabric.  The pattern is printed onto it, so that when you put the pants on, the fabric stretches and the pattern becomes very dull. Hard to explain, but it's like the pattern is printed onto the top of the fabric and when it stretches, there are white lines between where it is printed."
2.0,"The size of the bag was perfect for me, the color , the amount of space.  HOWEVER, what's a bag if the zippers don't work!  Very cheaply made zippers!  I cant even open and close without it getting stuck , and the grooves separate from each other.<br />Terrible. !  Never again will buy this brand."
2.0,I cannot accurately comment on this complete set.I only received the top on delivery.<br /><br />Pro's- the top was well made and the materials seemed to be a nice weight.<br />Con- it looked very small for a 3T.<br />I returned this due to not receiving the entire set.
2.0,I wear a medium helmet but this one size fits all is too small. Material feels like a thin  t-shirt but scratchy and not enough stretch. Label says 65% rayon and 35% polyester.<br />  I also ordered a Bohn skull cap which is way better feeling material made of polyester and spandex. Both are marketed as Perma Tech but not the same material. I think it would have fit if it had been made from the same material as the skull cap.
2.0,I wanted to like this shirt however the one I received has the sleeves sewn on inside out. Returned it.
2.0,Very cute. Runs VERY SMALL!!!
2.0,Broke in less than a year☹️
2.0,Very nice bag but very small like child size!
2.0,This top is way too small.  It is child sized. Perhaps because it is coming from China the size is different. I usually wear a Sz 5/6 and the medium was way to tight and short.  Nothing like the photo makes it seem like it would fit.
2.0,"Love the color and appearance. However, it didn't last. the snap came out of the band."
2.0,"I opened this rain suit yesterday and was surprised to find a little hazmat suit! It's made of the same material we use on construction sites for removing asbestos. This Tyvek type material is meant for temporary use and immediate disposal. I probably won't bother returning it, but will keep it for my son to take to Boy Scout Camp. It is lightweight and packs up small, but I expect this would last maybe two wearings and then will wind up in the garbage."
2.0,The cup is no bigger then my Playtex DDD and the lace had some missed stitches where it was attached to the body....sad.
2.0,They slide right off. The sock portion is not snug enough to keep the rubber bottom on my girls feet. The bottom ends up sideways as it falls off of them. We are hoping that when they get older (they are 1 now) the sock will fit better.
2.0,Beautiful bracelet; broke the second day I wore it.  I was so disappointed.
2.0,"Didnt get the hat that was in the picture but i guess its alright. Plain Red visor, with cheap material."
2.0,Turns your finger green...
2.0,"Very cute, but the battery didn’t last long - only about 3 months."
2.0,Returned very large
2.0,"The problem was that the small part that keeps the strap in place, broke in less than one week."
2.0,Made of nylon kept slipping off my head
2.0,I measured off bust size which was indicated as the most important measurement and the swimsuit fits everywhere but the length! Would've been soooo cute but was bummed to see it's made for someone petite or under 5' :-/ I'm 5'7&#34; and it's about 6&#34; short.
2.0,It is not what I expected because it looks different on website picture.
2.0,"Fits fine, super cute, but there’s this ridiculously strong rubber (almost weed) smell that hasn’t gone away in over A YEAR of having these. I’ve tried leaving them outside to air out and they still smell. Incredibly disappointing."
2.0,Junky material. The white fabric on the top is see through.
2.0,"Too small.  I am a true size 18, I ordered an 18W and it would not even fit over my thighs.  I ordered 2 other suits the same size and same time and they fit perfect, this one is Soooo small."
2.0,"I don't know if the purse I got was different than the other reviews I read about this purse but I'm being generous with a 2 star review.  It feels like a hard, fake, cheap plastic purse.  The interior fabric is like plastic, crinkly paper I would be scared to get into it at church it makes so much noise.  If I would have seen and felt this purse I wouldn't have paid any price for it, it's that bad.  It is so hard and rigid I can't even think of what it possibly could be good for.  So disappointed."
2.0,"It says it is 100% cotton, but I did a burn test as I am a fire performer, and it is definitely not 100% cotton. It is soft, but not the fabric content that was advertised."
2.0,"The dress ran a tad small.  And I ordered a size up.  It also had 3 red stains on the back.  The material is cheap. The pattern is cute, it’s a shame it was such poor quality."
2.0,These are too tight.  They hurt.  They're even tight on children's heads.
2.0,Not revommended
2.0,My dad just bought this on the family shared account and I do not think I want to know what it is used for.
2.0,These are way too tight and leave painful compression marks around the knees. I gave mine away and will not buy them again.
2.0,"great concept. they do stay in place very well, but they definitely shrink you down 1 to 1/2 sizes, which was too much for my needs."
2.0,"As some people have commented, the cut is straight and very narrow. The pattern is OK, but the whole effect is much &#34;greener&#34; than it appears on the picture. Personally, I didn't recognize the dress I ordered - which didn't matter anyway as it was not only too small, but the shape was off."
2.0,The necklace is beautiful. Quality is consistent with price so keep your expectations realistic. Mine was missing a stone. I’ve returned but ordered a replacement.
2.0,There was no stopper for the zipper and it came right off the end. I put the zipper back on and added a stopper and it popped off again because the zipper was too loose entirely. Now it won’t fill up with air.
2.0,Would have been a good shirt if the seams in it were sowed better. Ripped after three days.
2.0,Cheap silk screening.  Wouldn't buy again
2.0,"Due to having metal under outside surfaces, the wallet is very stiff & difficult to fully use the various pockets. It advertises room for checks but good luck trying to get the check register in there also! And if you do the above, then there is no room to put a pen in the slot provided. My next wallet will NOT have the metal inserts for &#34;safety&#34; reasons."
2.0,I immediately tried these on and as soon as I went to pull on the back of my boot it ripped on top part.. you get what you pay for cheap as cheap bottom line
2.0,unhappy but expecting to be so with AMAZON these days
2.0,"Bought this in an extra large and it still did not fit at the bust, it pulls tight across the bust and back. I wear a 34 DDD."
2.0,"Umbrella was much smaller than expected and didn't clamp well, nor did it adjust to avoid sun exposure."
2.0,No tiene la garantía de MK
2.0,Too short wanted nearly as a floor length
2.0,The brown color is not as dark as the photo
2.0,"This product will permanently darken your boots. Probably works as an oil but your boots will never look the same after!! Ruined a $250 pair of beautiful boots with this product! They were so nice looking and now they're too dark. Fine for work boots or any boot you don't care about the look on. But there should be a warning on the product that it's essentially a dye. Get a dye that won't darken, they won't go back!!"
2.0,They're so small.... Not the size I was expecting at all... Perfect size for an infant!
2.0,"the material makes it slippery and it wont stay put  like a regular beanie. I tried to put the beanie in a way that the front of my hair shows only about 1 inch or 2 like i do with my regular beanie, But this beanie wont grip to my head and slips back.<br />I was let down by the item :(<br />oh well."
2.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap material for the pants. Super thin and the string at the waist frayed badly after our toddler wore it for one day. Also- the shirt runs small. We got a 2T and our toddler who is in the 45th percentile for height and weight will only be able to wear it for a month or so.<br /><br />Cute for a one time photo session - but not much else"
2.0,"I just love how pretty my watch band is! I was very upset though because I received the watch band and within an hour of me wearing the new watch band, two of the jewels had fallen out. I ordered a replacement, so I am hoping that this does not happen again. I would have given 5 stars if this did not happen. Other than that, the watch band is beautiful!"
2.0,I don’t want to slam this product. It just didn’t work on my VOLVO Key fob. The hole in the fob was too small and this ring could not rotate in the hole.
2.0,"It’s a pretty ring, don’t get me wrong. It’s just HUGE. Much bigger than the picture shows."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, but they were just too wide.I exchanged for a size down and they were still too wide. They just felt too sloppy. They are well made and I liked the color. Wished they had worked."
2.0,"Love how these glasses look…<br />I ordered 2.0 magnification, received absolutely NO magnification. Clear glass"
2.0,The deadpool mask is so dark that one side is basically black. Disappointing
2.0,I love the shirt but did not know that the back of it was just see through material which means I can not wear it to many places. So I basicly wasted my money on t his shirt.
2.0,These shorts are huge!
2.0,Typically any design on the front of glasses is not seen by the person wearing them.  NOT the case here.  Kind of annoying seeing so much of the design when wearing.
2.0,VERY TIGHT!! and i got an XXL. I'm a size 14
2.0,Cool design but personally didnt like it
2.0,I returned these leggings because the material didn't stretch enough and felt to tight to move!
2.0,This is a really nice dress. But does not fit like it should around the neck.. My opinion its entirely to loose.
2.0,Not real happy with the product. It's not high quality by any means and it took over a month to get here.
2.0,One sizing is inconsistent. The blue shirt is about the size of a women's large and the peach color the size of a women's xs or xxs.
2.0,Cozy but the fabric pulls way too easy causing it to have snag lines.
2.0,I wasn’t very impressed. The dress was beautiful online but not so much in person it was to big and a few threads were coming out it looked more of a funeral dress rather than date night which is what I was going for
2.0,Barley fits as a medium. So disappointed
2.0,"Ineffective on touch screens, not very warm and not very waterproof. I use them for running, and have to stop and take them off to access my Apple Watch screen."
2.0,I love this dress until I put it on.  The zipper ripped out of the dress as I was getting ready for my event.  I didn't have a backup and had to go to Macy's and spend the $$$$on a dress.  You get what you pay for!
2.0,"Cheap fabric. I returned it about 3 weeks, they received it over 2 weeks but did not give refund. Very bad"
2.0,Not worth the cost.
2.0,These are so cute in the picture but the fit is off. Maybe it's my body frame but I tend to think it's the quality of the item.
2.0,I ordered a larger size just in case and it was still way too small.  The shoes were worn when I bought new and the stitching was coming undone.  Too bad because they were really cute.
2.0,"The fitting is a bit weird and it is very wrinkly after the wash. You will have to iron it if you decide to buy it. For me, it is buried in my closet now because I really don't have patience to iron this wrinkly shirt. Good luck."
2.0,The boots don’t fit tightly around the legs so we end up with wet feet after playing in the snow.
2.0,Good Quality but terrible design
2.0,see-through.
2.0,"Was a gift for my daughter, she loved purse, but after using a few times she just told me strap connector broke and cannot be fixed. Disappointed because she really liked the purse but now can’t use, return window closed, bummer."
2.0,"The stitching was very crooked. Looked very low quality. Also, the armholes were huge. Would definitely need to wear layered with another tank or a bikini."
2.0,"The leotard seemed great at first. Very soft and stretchy. Nice material. However, The seams are completely coming undone around the neckline."
2.0,"These are cute but if you need 8, buy 2 packages. The cat shaped key ring was missing a few sequins and the Bear was torn up on the foot."
2.0,"Sent it back- I am 5'7&#34; and 140 pounds and I ordered a small based on the other reviews. And it was still too large. the waist sits LOW on me, there was way too much fabric around the waist- made me look 20 pounds heavier. I would highly recommend it for a maternity dress since it's so loose and soft/stretchy fabric, but not otherwise."
2.0,Too long. See thru at the pockets. Had a hole around the shin.
2.0,Made me look as though I was pregnant. No bueno.
2.0,broke almost right away
2.0,"I thought this was an actual blazer, with ruched sleeves.  It's really more of a slinky sweater-jacket,  It's actually a nice thing, but not at all what I needed, and not what I thought I was ordering.  I am going to return it."
2.0,"1. It arrived with a huge hole in the left arm, so that was frustrating. 2. The small is more like a large (literally). It was way too big. 3. It was way longer than what you see in the picture. I felt like I was trying on a dress. If it wasn't for those three things, it would have been perfect."
2.0,"Flimsy & HOT, gets dirty fast and is hard to get clean.  I would stay away, looks can be deceiving-"
2.0,"These are NOT really worth the money. They work okay.<br /><br />However, I am much more pleased with the LOX™ Mega-Grip Earring Backs, 2 Pair Pack."
2.0,"Looks gorgeous, but definitely about 2 sizes smaller than labeled!"
2.0,They are much smaller than the picture indicated. Would have liked a bigger stone so could have been worn with multiple in each ear.
2.0,This is not for women with reasonably large breasts.  See how the image goes down in the middle?  It does not do this on me.  Instead it just makes your breasts stick out like a shelf.  It might work okay on small breasted women.
2.0,they look nothing like the picture when I ordered them...very cheap
2.0,Broke after I used it in 2 different pairs of shoes.  I'm still trying to use it and I think it is working but it is broken.I would look for an alternative if you haven't purchased one yet.
2.0,"I use a small fanny pack on my left hip when motorcycling. But the short strap and buckle on one side of this pack places the connection behind me, making it hard to put on or remove. To take off a fanny pack, I use my left hand to support it. So to get the buckle loose, I would have had to twist my right arm all the way behind me to the vicinity of my left back pocket. The extension strap that came with the pack was no help, as its buckle does not attach properly, falling off immediately every time."
2.0,"It said it would be able to fit a kid, and it didn't. The head was too large and you can't adjust the chin piece."
2.0,"I liked the shirt overall however I had to return it. I wore it one time and washed it, hung to dry. After that I noticed the stitching on the sleeve was coming apart. I went with this style because the one I wanted had poor reviews saying the material was coming apart. I guess this one was no better. I’m going to try Aftco for my fishing shirts."
2.0,"These are a super cute idea, I got these for my kid and their best friend, and they loved them!<br />The issue is that the 'necklace' strings are melted together where they should be adjustable, so they are too small for even a baby to use as a necklace, but too large to use as even a bracelet.<br />I left two stars because the scorpion heart halves are ok, but I bought these as yule presents and expected them to be able to use them out of the box."
2.0,this does not look like tike the pic - what I received was a darker color and instead of looking like blue jean material it is just a cheap cotton with loose threads all over like someone sewed it together and didn't finish - I was disappointed  - the little necklace was cute
2.0,Not quite as pictured... Has very cheap lining and is measurements are significantly smaller than sizing chart would suggest. I am a 5'5&#34; an 8/10 and ordered an XL and it is VERY snug.
2.0,"there appeared to be white paste (cleaner? buffing agent?) in all the crevices. I tried to scratch off with my fingernail, but no luck. I returned it and Amazon gave me a refund - no exchange on this piece (in case it was a fluke) as it's sold through Amazon but not BY Amazon."
2.0,"Cute, but doesn't have American flag patch as pictured. I tried to contact seller to no avail. Wish mine had the flag. That's why I ordered this one over others."
2.0,"The fabric is of a very poor quality. Its slightly uncomfortable and rough like cheap tablecloth.  The size is just right for me, but I still feel restricted in my movement. They aren't as comfortable as they look. The fabric doesn't stretch in any way and is very stiff. The pocket ripped a little the first time I stuck my hands in. I feel like they won't last very long.<br /><br />The pockets sit on your body in a way that isn't symmetric. It feels like you put on your pants twisted.<br /><br />I think they're really cool, and they make me feel like the Avatar. That being said, they're still not worth the price of around $30."
2.0,"I got two 500 bottles with my UD vest and I like them but not easy to drink on the move.  I went with the 500s to get the straw which comes out pretty high and makes it very easy for me to drink on the move.  The horrible downside is that I had to buy two new flasks to get the straws.  I already had two flasks.  Salomon makes a similar product and they sell straws separately.  The next issue is quality.  After 10 months of light use the rubber at the top seal has cracked and leads to some leaking when I'm not wearing it.  I would have liked it to last after a bit more use.  So now if I want to get new straws, I need to buy two more soft flasks with straws which is going to be $44.  I will probably just start looking around for third party flasks that will fit in the UD vest and not get gouged on the price.  Aonijie offers two 500ml bottles with straws for $26 so I think I will be saving $18 next time around."
2.0,Beautiful material and design.. but runs a little narrow.  Especially for linen.
2.0,The color was as expected but it is not flowy. It's clingy. I normally wear a medium and bought a large to ensure flowy and it doesn't. It's a cottony material.
2.0,Mask is fine the smell gave both my husband and myself a headache. I'm going to try and wash it out.
2.0,"The set is beautiful. However, one of the earrings was broken. The “stone” was not properly glued and fell off I guess during shipping. I glued it because I like the style. While wearing it the closure of the necklace detached (not glued properly). It’s a shame because the style is cute and is light."
2.0,"The material is very unforgiving, it shows every little imperfection.  I would not recommend purchasing this item, unless you are very fit and dont have a lot of curves.  It's very see through in the sun, if you do purchase I would highly recommend using very covering undergarments."
2.0,"These are so cute, but when you order a LARGE scrunchie band, you think it will offer any wiggle room...NOPE!!!  The bands are VERY SMALL and I have no idea how I would even get it on my wrist!  Bot to mention the loose pins that are not seen in.  I thought...let's try.  30 minutes later and I still cant get the stupid thing in since the versa 2 does not have room for lose fabric when you are trying to get a pin in!!!!  I really want a scrunchie band, so this is very disappointing. And I have to go through the return process on 2...NOT HAPPY!!!"
2.0,"This was a major disappointment, the actual item didn't really look like the picture. The chain is cheap and poorly made, and the necklace itself looked like something for a child.  I would not purchase again from this supplier."
2.0,"Not bright enough to be a functional light. Nice snap-ring, but it’s connected with a very weak link."
2.0,"Dress pattern Does not match the fabric pattern in the picture.  Very disappointed, gave it away to a relative who thought she might wear it."
2.0,Nice bracelet but broke the next day. Cheap quality.
2.0,"Stitching coming undone after one wearing, smaller than described in the listing, wouldn't recommend"
2.0,"No breaks the chain links easily , not recommended ."
2.0,"A few things:<br />-They sit high on the waist<br />-They are run very small (I’m an M, L too tight)<br />-I love pockets, but this has way too many"
2.0,"There is nothing &#34;compression&#34; about these shirts... the material is so thin it is almost see through. I also find them to be a bit short for work out shirts. You get what you pay for, cheap thin material..."
2.0,"I loved how it looked on the model, but on me it wasn't flattering at all. It was too wide and boxy, and it was too short. You could see my stomach when I lifted up my arm. I ended up returning it."
2.0,"Nice quality, but runs very small"
2.0,"They are soft and cozy - but the top is much smaller than the bottoms.  They take forever to dry in the dryer! I usually wear a small, but I bought a medium  for the extra length.  Turned out that the bottoms are much longer (which is fine because there is elastic at the ankle) but the top is much smaller (even though I bought a size larger than I normally wear!)"
2.0,The color is off! The picture is one color the outfit is another
2.0,"Runs pretty small.  It’s not a sweatshirt material at all it’s thin,  more like a tshirt, but not tshirt material.  Shiny.  Not super impressed, unfortunately."
2.0,"Back chain came off as I tried to put necklace on.  Pretty, but not well made."
2.0,"This watch is a two hand watch. you always have to use two hands to look at it, that makes it worthless for me, I am going to give it away for Christmas"
2.0,"I followed the chart and ordered a size up per the chart and all the recommendations and it was way too big in all areas. Material was ok, not sure if I would have kept it if it fit."
2.0,The little loops that attach to your glasses stems snap or break very easily.
2.0,"I like that you can bend to adjust with of your finger but if you bend it too much it breaks and some couldn’t handle bend and broke instantly, some are not stainless steel if not all"
2.0,"It wasn't what I expected, so I have sent it on to others."
2.0,Looked great in the packet. Extremely small and difficult to insert into nose.<br />Disappointed
2.0,"Something is wrong with the mechanics of my band, it's stuck and will not come off of my fitbit. So I am now stuck with this band at all times. This is not a good band for wearing to the gym. I'm so frustrated. I've tried everything to get the band off and it is seriously stuck."
2.0,Return because it was so heavy weight
2.0,The molding clay it comes with does not work
2.0,Product looked great until my toddler wore it once. It pulled all over the place and literally had holes in it
2.0,I love the bracelet but it broke a few days after wearing. It’s really thin.
2.0,"Full disclosure I purchased this item for $3 with a discount for my honest review. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the fabric isn’t bad. It’s not super soft but not rough either, it’s what I expect a beach cover up to feel like. The stitching was also good no fray’s. However the back cross is lopsided and the garment is incredibly huge I’m 5’0 and 117lbs bought a small in both colors, it swallowed me, it’s so big I’m pretty sure it can pass as a tight fighting large. Also it’s really thin and see thru."
2.0,Looks cheap. Didn't like the color..
2.0,"Broke after the first time I wore it.  Also, the gold looks very cheap. Definitely not for plus sized or even medium sized folks. If the belt has to stretch much at all it will break. The ends are just glued together. Disappointing."
2.0,"Can't be compare to the original Oakley glasses. Cheap made. I bought the polarize lens and I don't think they are. I still see better with the original lens with all the scratches. I'm still going to buy a new lens from Oakley. They cost a lot more ($120) but worth it, a lot better."
2.0,Shoes were  too small. Disappointed and had to by a whole size bigger.
2.0,"It looks so great in the photo but it really doesn't fit well.  The waist is too large and doesn't dip in like the picture shows.  Plus, I like my shirts a little longer and this was is too short for my tall frame."
2.0,"Glasses are very stylish! But unfortunately, the frame is very fragile, maybe too dry. 2 of the 3 broke already. If it wasn't for the fragile frame, I'd buy it again. Both glasses broke at the same place."
2.0,"Though cute, these are definitely for narrow faces, I say so because of the too little frame width that makes it fit extremely tight on my Round Face. The lens width is also too little that my Peripheral Vision is totally blocked. I would advise all Round-faced like me out there to stay away from this product(except you want to take your chances...GOOD LUCK!)"
2.0,"Did not like these when I saw them in person, they are not oversized and they don't cover my eyes fully the way I like. Gave them to my niece"
2.0,"Fits great in the body. The breast plates are ridiculous, though. I thought they might be removable cups, but the are hard, huge, thickly padded underwire cups that fit well below my natural C's. Just kinda floating around in there lol.<br />Great silloute if I don't move around, bend over or have anyone standing above me on the side of the pool while I'm in the water so....thanks?"
2.0,break easy
2.0,"Very cheaply made.  I thought it would be cute and maybe if I was 12 I wouldn't worry about the quality of the shirt....unfortunately, I am not so I did."
2.0,These run extremely small and fabric very thin.  Returning all 3 I bought
2.0,"Misleading image, This is basically like a toddler's seatbelt if it was made in a sweatshop."
2.0,Size runs big and &#34;stone&#34; is cheap and plastic looking. Returned.
2.0,I loved it the product looked beautiful and the first time I wore it the beads broke off one side all over a bathroom floor & I was going to take my business photo right after with it on :(
2.0,"My ring is starting to turn color , and it took a very long time for shipping much longer than i expected."
2.0,My 11 year old loved the look of the band but the quality is very cheap.  It has already fallen apart and she lost the pin when it fell off her wrist so there is no hope of fixing it.  She only wore it for a week.
2.0,The pants are way to low and the pants only are so tight. Had to return.
2.0,Perfect color but the buckle strap is sewn together so completely non adjustable so I had to return sandal for being too wide
2.0,"My son hates these shoes. They are very well made, and they seem very durable, but my son says the tongue inside really bothers his toes. He usually never complains about shoes, so it must be pretty bad. Of course, I have tossed the box, so to the shelter they go."
2.0,"too small, order larger.  My son is 3yrs old, not fat, pretty slim actually, and he did not fit into 4T's."
2.0,Weird material. It's not very flattering.
2.0,"Love the hat hate the adjustment clamp.  The clamp is about as thin as a beer can and does not stay secure.<br />Generally speaking about hats, I'd leave it at that but this is a Jeep hat.  It is best to assume that if someone is ordering this hat, that person probably drives a Jeep.  Now, this requires you (the hat seller) knowing something about a Jeep and Jeep owners.<br />We like to drive with the top off, the doors off, most anything that can come off.  It's pretty windy when drive our Jeeps and it PRETTY IMPORTANT that our hat stays on.  With that flimsy clip always coming loose it's not a good Jeep hat."
2.0,"I have bought several night clothes in this brand, in both L and XL and they have always fit well.  I purchased XL for this set.  The pants are fine perfect length and fit, the color is good, but the top is extremely tight, uncomfortable to wear and shows every bulge.  The pants and tops seen mismatched in size.  I won’t buy this brand again as I can’t trust the sizing chart."
2.0,"I expected this collar to be a good quality because of its price $26. However on the inside are along all four sides very visible lines as if a child was drawing on it. It’s made with pen, it’s visible and look awfull. I’ll add pics ."
2.0,It doesn't look like the picture. It has a textured look to it that made it look cheap.
2.0,"The first time I ordered this flamingo one they sent something else.  This arrived today and I love it and can wear it but it’s not any too big.  But yes, I can wear it and it’s pretty"
2.0,"Picture shows adjustable straps.  Actually, there are two different pictures of the backside, now that I look.  They are just plain straps with no adjustment.<br />It's very stretchy."
2.0,"You get what you pay for, obviously a rip off from the more expensive one I saw online.<br />Runs very small, I wear a small in everything and this one makes me look like I’m pregnant. (I’m 5’5”, 118lbs)"
2.0,"I buy all my dresses from this maker in the same size, in fact bought 3 different with this order, however the yellow and black version was WAY smaller than the other ones. Unsure if it was mislabled or not. I cut off the tags before putting on since i THOUGHT i knew my size in this dress since i have about 10 of them in different colors - so cant return. Size up in this dress if you are a regular buyer."
2.0,Had one in gray got lost. Ordered this pack good deal in two. Fit well to me and live the extra wings
2.0,Didn't fit well and not adjustable.
2.0,The hanging pearl fell off and one of the glued pearls came off.  Not worth what I paid for it.
2.0,"These are so ugly! I shouldn’t have expected much since they were so inexpensive, but they are really cheap looking. They did arrive quickly and were nicely packaged though."
2.0,Too small not adjustable.
2.0,"the color options were awesome, if only they BOTH worked....only one lit up even after charging....."
2.0,"I bought these for my 7 year old daughter and she loved the color, but after about 5 separate days of wear these literally fell apart, the top green piece snapped off of the yellow bottom.  I would not recommend these, just a few weeks into the summer and I already need to buy another pair of sandals for my daughter."
2.0,It's a physics equation. Sigh...
2.0,"This is a cute mask, and nicer fabric from others I've seen. However, I washed it once and the ear string broke from the first wash. Wish I could at least get a new one, but the return window closed a mere 10 days ago (oddly short return window for Amazon)."
2.0,"I ordered these as a gift for someone who is and has been an XL for the past 40 years.  The ratings were great, and I expected them to be a little tight (being tummy takers), but I held them up before wrapping them, and I am a solid medium (5'6"" 145) and these would have been snug on me!  I ordered an XL shapewell shirt at the same time, and it looked a little closer, but still looked more like a large to me. I returned them both and ordered different brands after reading reviews that included weight/height with the size."
2.0,"I agree with another reviewer, these are far smaller and of a lower quality than desired. One of them was even broken straight out of the package.  The coil material is not as thick as expected or desired either.<br />I purchased these for a kids party and its a good thing because they're very small and really only suitable for a child's wrist. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I'll be giving them away at s kids party."
2.0,"I have several older Russell sweatshirts and liked them a lot.  They were 2-3 years old.  I bought 2 in the past month, one was this hoodie, the other with no hood.  The sleeves on both are at least an inch shorter than the old sweatshirts.  I sent one back, gave the hoodie to a nephew, and am now buying my sweatshirts from a local store where I can try them on.  Whoever is now making the Russell sweatshirts is trying to save on material cost by taking it out of the sleeves, I guess."
2.0,the diver's left bag is broken
2.0,"It’s cheaper than the picture as many reviews had suggested but took a chance due to price and needed a white dress for a tea party. Ended up wearing something else to that event!!!<br /> I’m 5’5”, it’s atleast 4”too long. Donating it to a thrift store without once wearing it😕"
2.0,"Ya know how sometimes you buy cheap shoes online and they turn out to be good quality, unfortunately these are not those kinds of shoes. They were cheap and it shows."
2.0,I ordered this dress for my daughter's wedding.  The dress was at least two sizes too big.  She usually wears an 8 or 10 so I ordered the 8.  It was too late to have it altered and I didn't want to have to pay extra to ship it back.  Very disappointed
2.0,The fabric on this bike short is quite thin and the medium size runs larger than what I consider medium.<br />I like the pattern but that is about it.  I will be returning it.
2.0,Turned my ears black with one wear.......  disposed of them quickly.  They looked beautiful but were tarnished and pitted when using them for 1 full day...........  didn't expect that.
2.0,I’ve been looking for a simple wedding dress to get married at the courthouse. It’s so pretty in the photo. I was really disappointed when I inboxed it. Looked very cheaply made. Hated the way it fit.
2.0,It’s a cute swimming suit but it runs much smaller than it indicates.  The sizes are NOT US sizes.  The product material is very very thin and very very tiny.
2.0,"The leggings are decently made. The fabric is good quality and the design is nice. But they are too small. I wear M/L. I ordered M but I was not able to put the pant leg higher than my knee. If you want it to fit, order at least one if not two sizes up."
2.0,They were too large for my face. I have a round small face and they looked weird on me. Will be returning
2.0,This dress was just toooo cheap looking.  the fabric was too thin...<br />Didn't like at all and it was too large
2.0,"The face of the watch started to fade. My daughter loved the color but after a couple of months, the face of the watch started to fade.  It's more of a toy than a watch for a 9 year old."
2.0,The blue color square fell out after a few weeks of wearing. Would like a replacement.
2.0,I would definitely not consider this a sweater or sweatshirt but more of a long sleeve shirt. Returned this item as soon as I received it and didn’t even try it on because it was far from a sweater.
2.0,"Like the top, but I usually wear a medium, but ordered a large because some of the reviews<br />mentioned that it ran small.  I needed to get an extra large and I wear a size 8 in a dress or top."
2.0,Its very very cute BUT it runs incredibly small. Like.... literally 2 or 3 sizes too small. Fyi.
2.0,Was stretching material did fit right
2.0,The bracelet is beautiful!  But as a gift with the charging crystal missing- it loses the unique aspect of the gift. Also kind of embarrassing when I gave it to her!
2.0,Not as long as pictured and it shrinks more if washed
2.0,Super cheap.  I should have known.  My mother always said &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  This material is so bad.  It's like a bad kids Halloween costume material.  I am giving it away.  I ordered a Medium and is fit as expected.  I waited almost six weeks for it to arrive!  It's awful.
2.0,Good quality but runs really small
2.0,"Marble looks nice but the clear bumper around the perimeter of the case is a little cloudy. The lip of the case is flush with the face of the phone. The peep hole cutout for the camera is crooked as well.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a cheap phone case just to get by, then this is a good one."
2.0,The necklace I received was different
2.0,I love the socks love the color was worried they would feel rough but they don’t. I tried a pair on and though they would be longer than they hat they were. The next day I tried a pair on and they were longer so I compared a couple pairs and sure enough some of these socks were longer than the other VERY frustrating!!!!!
2.0,"Gloves are nothing like an actual hand,  it's like they were traced and sewn together.  The Santa hat does not fit the grinch head so be prepared to get something different.  The suit itself is itchy as heck! Bypass this one!"
2.0,"Ridiculously too small.  Usually ordered a medium, went for a large, too tight, exchanged for and XL and still way too tight.  Won't order from this company again - they need to get their sizing fixed."
2.0,2 out of theee have broken already. My purse is only 6 lbs. They’re very pretty but not sturdy enough for a bigger purse. Gave the last one to my daughter because she has a small cross body purse
2.0,The hat itself wasn't to bad but the flag decal was rather bad looking. Would not buy again.
2.0,Fit is way to small as well as having logos the pictures do not show.
2.0,Weird fit. Ended up returning.
2.0,The clasp on the necklace was broken and it was a gift for my son's girlfriend.  I am taking it to the jewelry Doctor.
2.0,Dont like the material
2.0,It's kind of cheaply made. And it's really tight. I wear a lot of belts like this and this one is super tight and uncomfortable. I rarely wear it. Its not as nice looking as the picture shows in my opinion.
2.0,This charm is very cute and looked great on my phone however it broke after one week of use on the part where the rope meets the metal holder. I wouldn’t purchase again.
2.0,"Really bummed about the durability.  This bra was so within my budget, soft and simple and one of the MOST comfortable bras I have ever owned. Unfortunately, within the first 2 weeks of light use (1 of 3 bras in circulation), some underwire has now started to pop out. Not very durable."
2.0,"Because of size differences and fabric, the fit is less than desirable. Also the peplum does not have any flare. It sags."
2.0,The top was to big and the bottom was to short. It left nothing to the imagination. It looked like a big belt. Also the skirt was coming apart at the seams so I returned it.
2.0,"If I could’ve felt the material before I purchased this item, I never would have bought this."
2.0,item is sized very small...would recommend ordering 2 sizes larger than needed
2.0,I had to return this because the fit of the pants for fairy weird. I couldn’t tell which was the front and which was the back by the fit even though there was a tag they’re definitely high waisted but a little uncomfortable with the elastic around the waist. Shirt fits great
2.0,"It looks nice, but I can’t charge my fossil watch w/o having to take off the whole band."
2.0,"Kind of hate it...? WAY too short, 5'7"". You get what you pay for, my whole butt shows when I bend over, there's a slit up the back and I almost feel like it's defective with how ""high"" it is. Worn once."
2.0,I just did not like it.
2.0,Muy buena calidad no pasa el agua .. pero donde esta la costura de la bolsa que lleva enfrente filtra el agua al usarlo para lavar los trastes no funciona para mantenerte seca tu blusa de abajo.
2.0,"Really pretty color. Very long for me, but I'm 5'3. I find the criss cross design quite challenging to do, and I have not worn it because I can't figure it out."
2.0,"I love this shirt. Love the colors and the sizing. It was packaged with a thin tissue paper to protect the flag and flower. When removing the tissue, a lot of it has stuck to the decal on the shirt. It will not come off. Like I said, I love the shirt but don't know how to get that tissue off."
2.0,"The mask itself fits its needs, but there is no glitz to it. The picture makes it appear glitzy but it is in no way the way it appears in the pic . I bought it for the glitz which is why I decided to give this only two stars ."
2.0,"These gloves are very nice — even without the heating system. Alas, the heating system doesn't deliver enough heat. I'd like these much more if the gloves got warmer! Also, it is hard to see the colors of the on/off indicator in outside light. Finally, it appears the heat turns off on its own, perhaps based on time or temperature. Bottom line: these aren't the answer for extended outdoor activities in cold weather. LOOK ELSEWHERE!<br />I returned the gloves and got a new set. Also not good. Never got really warm. Returned it also. Save your money. Buy hand warmers that fit in the gloves!"
2.0,Wore 3 times.  Neck elasticity is shot. There's no label on it.  Seems like a scam operation.
2.0,These were perfect at first but then they started to unravel after only a few days and wouldn’t stay tightened so it fell off. Really loved the idea of it and seemed like good quality but then only lasted less than a week
2.0,"Fits true to size, but the fabric is thin and shows the line of your undergarments, etc."
2.0,Very soft and great length but poor quality. Holes started to form after one wearing and one wash. Very very disappointing. Really wanted to love these socks.
2.0,"Dont buy this..,is a 10$ polo with nike logo!!👎👎👎"
2.0,2/4 were bent in their packages and one didn't have a back to it.
2.0,"For starters I tried canceling the order once I realized it wasn't through Prime and the seller refused! I requested a cancellation before the item was even shipped and I also contacted Amazon. Both were no help. The item arrived today so I figured I would try it on anyways. The color is beautiful which is why I gave it the two stars but the back of the bathing suit is like a thong and didn't cover my butt at all. I am very petite at 5'4"" and under 110lbs so it's not like I have a big booty. The front is also cut very wierd. The straps are also ridiculously long. I went to start the return process and am being charged to ship back an item I didn't want to begin with?! So ridiculous."
2.0,It’s pretty on the photo but chain was too thin!
2.0,This was smaller than I anticipated and I did not like the plastic zippers. They did not glide easily and I found they stuck a lot
2.0,"This shirt is made out of a strange fabric. It is almost mesh-like and has a bizarre, sort of scratchy texture. I put it through the wash with fabric softener to see if it might make it feel better. It's still lousy.<br />Considering the price, I thought the shirt might be better quality than it is. Needless to say, I am disappointed."
2.0,"Pros: Cute for two seconds.<br />Cons: The picture is misleading because the laces are adult-sized laces and are tucked away on the inside of the shoe. When the shoe arrived and I tied the laces, the loops were HUGE and dragged on the floor. They were so long they got caught on our child's bike pedals. Also plan on having these shoes ruined within a weekend. They get scuffed and stained immediately."
2.0,"I bought this underwear for my husband to make me happy :). It is little small, does look sexy, but I was very disappointed that it doesn't have an open fly! Yes, the black underwear on the picture looked like it did have this feature. I guess it is a different choice of design, might be quite sexy too, but I still wouldn't have bought it, if I knew."
2.0,Cute but broke first time wearing<br />Strap unraveled
2.0,So much shorter than shown in the picture!  Can't wear it.
2.0,"I am 4'11, about 115 lbs and was hoping to have these to wear under my clothes for when I coneal carry. I bought the smallest size and they are still gigantic and loose. Will be returning."
2.0,"this is a nice looking bag but too heavy, especially after adding items to it.  the handles are too bulky get in the way when you use as a cross body bag for hands free shopping.  I don't like handles that stick me in the armpits.  if I had not gotten rid of packing material I would have sent it back, but I will just live with it now."
2.0,"Didn't fit like the picture, really baggy"
2.0,"Whomever molded these ears, used a petite person. For an average American adult, you cannot get them to slip on without trimming the edges with a knife."
2.0,It wasn't the right fit for me.
2.0,This product is unwearable if you are over 5’10” tall.  Very cheap material and not symmetrical.  I had high hopes but I’m giving up.  I’ll give it to a little cousin who can wear it out and toss it.  At least it was super cheap!
2.0,Don't wear earrings
2.0,"The elastic unravels, so I had to change it. The beads are beautiful"
2.0,I lov this casual style but mine was made wrong  the line between the bottommost top comes up across my breast n I kept havin to pull down Manufacturer didn’t catch the mistake  so the skirt comes up  it needs a longer top n attract under ur breast n cinch  someone should’ve tried one on before they sent them out all over the United States I’m very disappointed  the picture is beautiful it’s a cute dress but I can’t to cut the top off and put another piece of material between the bottom and the top so that I have a normal dress no one wants the big skirt line across your two breast I was very disappointing I’m gonna have to return it but the pictures r  beautiful
2.0,Looks like i can only wear it at home like a lounge dress . Disappointing cotton quality. I am keeping because I like the color though.
2.0,I'm a large but the shirt fits like a small medium. It was extremely hard to pull off once I had it on.
2.0,"Update: I had to change my rating because this morning (6/2) only after roughly 4 weeks of wearing these the front fell off.<br /><br />Original: I don't know if I got the only good pair in the lot, but I have had them for almost a month and they are fine. I love them and get lots of complements on them, and can put my delicate hoops through the tunnel and get to wear earrings I haven't in a long time."
2.0,I was disappointed with this item. I’m even more disappointed that American clothes are made in countries that don’t understand our American sizing requirements.
2.0,"This backpack is for my 13-year-old daughter. It is very pretty, but the straps are kind of wonky. I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"If you’re looking for a cheap bathing suit that is cheaply made, this is it. The white bottoms are very see through once they are wet. They also fit very tightly! I’m 5’2 and 130 pounds, and a medium is almost too tight. However, the top fits well and the colors in it are very vibrant!"
2.0,"These slippers may be warm, but they were not what I expected so I returned them.<br />They are very roomy on the inside (width), but run short length wise. There is no stability on the bottom, so to me they are like slipper socks that your feet slide around in."
2.0,"Doesn't look like in the picture, (cheaper look in real life)  Where the seam is (at the bust ) sticks out too much, making what you want to wear with it very limiting. Need to return."
2.0,"I love this watch band. The color and style are beautiful, however the individual elastic strands are not durable. Within 1 week of beginning to wear this band 1 strand broke at the tie off and a second strand is already starting to fray. I am very disappointed."
2.0,Very cute but sending it back. The gold buttons screw off and I am concerned they will fall off.
2.0,very delicate threads in the silk that came loose and plucked up the first time I used them as an inner glove to a pair of deerskin outer gloves I have had several pairs of silk liners did not experience this condition before - returned then to Amazon for a refund -
2.0,not clear...
2.0,Not enough room.
2.0,"The base plug in this horn was tacked in and poorly fitted. Powder would have poured out all around it. It worked ok for me because I bought it to rebuild. I made a new base plug for it, glued it in, drilled both ends and put in brass fill plug and powder valve along with a new strap. Next time I will just buy a plain horn and start from scratch."
2.0,"These socks are way too short. They are pretty comfortable, but need to be longer. They look child size."
2.0,Sizing is accurate. It’s  a T-shirt. Jersey material. Not a sweater.
2.0,This chain is way to big I feel like DMX
2.0,It's see thur and super short I'm 5'2 the material is cheap. :/
2.0,"Too small, be sure to check size when ordering"
2.0,Chinsey
2.0,Bought these in March of 2018. They were great! I wore them swimming all the time. I use this daily. I was very happy with the way they float...then they started to come apart. I feel like this product would be better if the pattern were a sleeve the foam goes inside instead of adhered to the foam.
2.0,"Technically nothing “wrong” with the shirt, it’s just a COMPLETELY different sleeve style than shown. This is not the look I wanted, so it’ll be going back."
2.0,"They're cute and comfortable for walking around the house. I bought these for a comfortable flip flop to go for walks outside in but discovered the hard way they can't be worn for any real length of time. I made the mistake of going for an hour long walk in these shoes and while they felt comfortable DURING the walk, once I got home my right foot started having major pain issues around my cuboid bone. I ended up not being able to walk w.o excruciating pain for over a week. Tried multiple times since then to go for a walk w. These shoes but always make my 1 foot sore. Switched these out for my sneakers and bam, no more foot pain. I had a pair of Nike flip flops I used to walk in and was hoping to replace them with these but apparently that was a mistake."
2.0,"The picture clearly shows (or at least looks like) it has a zipper - and based on reviews - some of this same product did. But the one I ordered did not, which doesn't allow my husband to wear it the way he would want. One of the main reasons we bought this one was for the zipper. The product also seems cheaply made - but again, I could get over that if the product at least came as pictured. I would beware of this seller."
2.0,Sweater is nice but worried to wash it. Looks like it can unravel any moment. Came with lots of strings already coming apart :( also the color is not like the picture. I ordered red but the actual sweater is like a stitch of red and white so its much lighter and not solid red.
2.0,First time out band pin broken<br />Too weak
2.0,"The band is easy to install but the fit is just too off for me. Either it is too big or too small. If you have the perfect wrist, this band would be great."
2.0,The money clip is very difficult to get bills into or out of.  The pockets for the credit cards are very tight.
2.0,Dress ripped at the seam the first time my daughter wore it. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Super cute bottom half, top barely holds me in. Bought a large, I’m 5’11” and 140, size 36C. Bottom is cute and cheeky but side boob explosion. Haven’t worn it in public out of worry. Would be cute, but probably shouldn’t move around in it."
2.0,"This was extremely large, has to be returned"
2.0,the dress itself does look like the pic. But the material and the fitting of it does not. The material is that clingy material and it does not fit like the model in the picture. I thought the dress material was thicker than it is
2.0,For adults is fit good.but for the kid so small more than the age of the kid.if your kid 5 years old you have to buy side 7 or 8 year old.
2.0,"I got these for 7yo son. They are fine in the length (I measured per the instructions), but are much too wide. So if he pulls the straps across tight enough, they touch the ground. Also the soles are coming off the toes. And he's only been wearing them for a month and a half."
2.0,These were definitely designed for someone with a bigger crotch than me. It was a full hand length too long for me just in the front. Super awkward feeling and cheap material.
2.0,"Too tight, cannot wear them. And My calf size is within the limits. Even sent one pair back for a bigger size and still too tight to wear"
2.0,The nose pieces are not in the right place and they look larger in real life than in the picture
2.0,"These shoes did not have the quality zi was expecting. They were very narrow and were unexpectedly flimsy. Also, there was not a return slip included in the packaging."
2.0,It said it was for 12 months but when I got it it looked more for a baby doll than a baby she’s 22 pounds
2.0,The tee has no shape. Has a worn look and hard to tell the right from the wrong side.
2.0,It only lasted 2 months :(
2.0,VERY short in length!!! And sleeves alittle short also
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, I wanted to keep it but it was just so small for stated size and so short that it looked kind of funny, it would be better if the bottom was loose and it could hang open, but it was elasticized and tight so it zipped right underneath the boobs and looked kind of odd"
2.0,"These shirts run huge and they're basically a straight box. Not fitted at all, so you'll look overweight if you're not. My husband didn't like this shirt and we sent it back."
2.0,I wanted to use them as gifts but when I got them they looked old fashioned and not as cute as the picture.
2.0,They broke easily which was a bummer because they were pretty cute.
2.0,"Disappointed that this is so small.  It's really pretty. The background color is almost peachy, instead of the off white shown in the picture. I couldn't get it on over my shoulders, there is no stretch. Also, the arms are pretty thin. I'm returning it."
2.0,"Does not fit well.. very tight around hips and tummy, drapes funny."
2.0,"I ordered these socks because they were advertised as diabetic compression socks.....nowhere on the package of socks is the word &#34;diabetic&#34;, only for leg fatigue and swelling..Now questioning this purchase"
2.0,"the quality is fine, and the length is fine. but they won’t stay up above my waist...they slid down."
2.0,"The shorts are light and comfortable enough. The big problem they have is that the pockets are attached to the reflective strips and are only glued on to the rest of the shorts. For me, after a few months of using the shorts the glue started giving out. I eventually sewed them back on, but still, more work than probably necessary."
2.0,Very cheap material- extremely see through as well. It didn’t remote match my measurements in any way. Going to return it as soon as possible- this was not an inexpensive amazon purchase either.
2.0,"Very thin and stretch out quickly.  The grey one is the only one that seems to be made of a better, thicker material."
2.0,"The headwraps were nothing like the illustrations shown. The headwraps looked as though they were cut from a loosely fitting template. The straps were just a longer piece of fabric that was difficult to tie tightly. The caps fit okay, they were a little large and would not fit snug on top of your head. Choosing a product that fives you lots of pieces for a low price is not always the best deal."
2.0,WAY TOO SMALL.  My dad wears a size 11 in men’s and they don’t even come close to fitting him.  My mom & are a size 9 in women’s and they fit us.  Although they are a little tight on my normal-sized calves but not so bad that they’re uncomfortable.
2.0,"I have not even had these 6 months, and the weaving is already falling apart, and they have holes in them.  They would be going back, but they are now outside the return window.  $13 for two of these is too much to pay."
2.0,"This is my second pair.  The first pair would not charge so I returned it.  This pair is behaving erratically.  Each shoe behaves differently,  Sometime one shoe only works when walking in it.  So far, I cannot figure out how long either shoe holds the charge.  I will give it one more day ( it has been four days and no day has been the same) to see if they would in a predictable manner.  If not, I will return them.<br />Third pair worked.  They don't stay charged for more than 5 or 6 hours, so plan your day. The first to pair were returned because on of the shoes in each pair would not charge/ or quit after 10 minutes."
2.0,Arrived on time and pretty from a distance but when u get close it looks very cheap
2.0,"not very good, all of the stones are falling out. Waste of money"
2.0,Fabric was nice but the shirt was not tapered like the one in the picture. It was wide like something for a grandma
2.0,Too big. No belt so it looked like a sack. Recommend a size smaller.
2.0,It missing the mask and wig and it okay I guess tiktok otayashiro
2.0,My daughter is 12 and is very petite usually a 10/12 will fit her; this item runs small. If your considering this product go for the larger size
2.0,The size is too big for your pocket.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress more. It was adorable, simple and sweet in style. But the sizing tag label was literally a sticker you could peel off. The little tie around the neck was barely tacked on with only a stick or two. The sticking all around didn't look like it would hold up to very many washes. I returned it."
2.0,"Really cute pin, however it should have two backings instead of just one. The pin is heavy and leans too far forward and you can’t see the pin at all when it’s on something :("
2.0,"This is way too hot unless you’re in a blizzard. Also, even after washing several times it won’t stop shedding. Size was good."
2.0,I've only had this a few months and somehow the edge is so rough that it keeps catching on my shirts and ruining them.  I am disappointed because the color matches my fitbit perfectly.
2.0,"Great gloves. EXCEPT we've had issues with the lining coming out. And once it's out, it's virtually impossible to get back in again.<br /><br />I'll probably still buy again to replace the ones the liner came out of because my kids love having the long gloves."
2.0,It is quite small. Not a statement piece.
2.0,Not sure if all products are like this but mine certainly is. It looks just as advertised but it's so sticky the minute I used it I got a lot of hair and dust stuck to it. I was intending to use this a lot as a stress ball of sorts but it being so sticky makes this difficult. It also sticks to itself when I squeeze it and I have to put it apart. Overall I would not buy again and would honestly like either a replacement or a refund.
2.0,"I am returning this product. I always wear a small, and this was difficult to clip, has cheap buttons, and the sides where it hits your hips is so high that is showed my skin when I had pants on.  Imagine an 80s spandex unitard with super high hip cut outs. Not what I want to wear to work with dress pants."
2.0,Fits as expected but cheaply sewn together. There was a large hole in the crotch
2.0,Cheap. Not what I hoped for.
2.0,"The day I ordered this, I would have definitely given it five stars. But after one wash (let it air dry) it had to of shrunk at least 2 sizes. Now it's basically a long t shirt. I wouldn't suggest purchasing this if you want to wear it more than once."
2.0,Had to return it. The color was more of a &#34;safety&#34; yellow than banana yellow.
2.0,The Luggage it is good but first trip and need repair already the pull out handle verily come out in one luggage
2.0,These shoes are thin and they run really small.  They look cheap and don't look like they will hold up very well.  I plan on giving them away.  I love a good pair of slippers and this does not feel like a good pair of slippers!!!
2.0,This cover up is poorly made and was too large. I will be returning it. The material felt very cheap and hard. It was not very comfortable.
2.0,The material is like a thin cotton. I personally didn't like that my underwear could almost be seen. A size up in pants would've been better but top would fit lose and material was still not like some sellers. Def wouldn't wanna wear in the cold w/o another pair underneath!
2.0,The clasp broke within 2 weeks of wear. It just fell off my arm.
2.0,not what I expected at all
2.0,Super disappointed in the sizing of these. It wont fit him until he's a toddler which doesn't quite make sense given the slogan is new kid on the block.
2.0,I was very disappointed with these glasses. I have difficulty with driving at night. I was hoping these glasses would help. The only difference I notice is everything is more yellow when I wear them. I wasted my money.
2.0,Top is a perfect fit but the bottoms were for a size 2 or possibly a child's size. Quality was excellent though for the price....just wish the bottoms fit.
2.0,"I did so want this to work. I love the idea of the very smooth, stretchy straps and back.  However, after trying several different sizes, I’ve come to the conclusion that it is just an overall bad design. The cups are too small so you are smooshed together in the middle. In addition, no matter the size, the second you raise your arms, you fall out the bottom. It’s pretty, but useless."
2.0,"I was so excited to get this dress. The materials are nice and thick.<br />The pleating is a bit odd to be honest.<br />But the biggest problem is after ONE time wearing this dress, the zipper broke! It was very shoddily sewn where the skirt meets the top."
2.0,"I have had four or five of this model watch over the last several years.  For each one, one of the four &#34;brackets&#34; that holds one end of the strap pin broke off within a year which made each of the watches useless.  Consequently, I had to buy new ones.  I have kept buying the same watch over and over because I like their functions and they are very inexpensive.  But I guess you get what you pay for.  Secondly, a strap recently broke on my latest watch, so I went to replace the strap with one from one of my previously broken watches and found that the straps appear to be non-replaceable because the strap pins are permanently affixed to the watch rather than being spring loaded as in most watches.  So I wouldn't recommend this watch until they fix the design flaw."
2.0,"The size was way off. I normally wear X-large or sometimes XX-large,these were no where near correct. Labeled XX Large, more like medium to large at best. Also very short waist to crotch. I liked the material, too bad about the sizing"
2.0,Cheaply made hat would have been ok for dressing down but it runs small.
2.0,Strap broke after only a few days. Would not recommend
2.0,These were SO too big!!!!!
2.0,not for a newborn
2.0,The spinners don’t spin. The 3 rings that are suppose to spin on top of the ring are all welded together & impossible to move. It’s not even nice to wear as it’s super bulky. Don’t waste your money
2.0,The dress looks burgundy online... it did not match the description. It came bright red like Christmas. I was unable yo use it for photos like I planned. But kept it because otherwise it is nice.
2.0,Couldn’t even tell what print was. The mask was good
2.0,These shoes are adorable but the fit for both of my girls just doesn’t work. My oldest has very narrow feet and my youngest has chubby toddler feet. On both children I have to adjust the front straps so tight that I run out of Velcro and they slide all over the place. I ended up flying the straps (by the toes) closed on my little ones sandals bc they just wouldn’t stay put. Unfortunate bc they’re pricey.
2.0,super uncomfortable
2.0,"Cute but, cheaply made and only come in one size:/ our daughter wore the ones that could fit her and on the 2nd day one broken in half. They are cheap like quarter machine rings."
2.0,Pretty cheap stickers that fade if you touch it a few times.
2.0,The back pack started falling apart after one week of use and the trolley wheels broke after two weeks.
2.0,Not for covering up tattoos. Fabric is thin.
2.0,It was wayyyy more pink than the picture. Like peptobismal pink. Fabric looked cheaper than in the picture. I did like the way it fit.
2.0,"The description is that it will be invisible in any pump, ballet or low cut shoe. That is a bit of a stretch. They are fine for ballet flats but not for a high heeled pump. I tried them in every pair of heels I have and they were visible in them all. But they were invisible in all the ballet flats. I wear a size 7.5 to 8. The material is nice - more like thin socks than pantyhose. I haven’t worn them out and about yet so can’t say if they will stay on but they do feel secure.<br />If the description said they were only for ballet flats or a high cut pump then I would have given them 5*. They categorically are not for a low cut or high heeled pump if you have a size 8 foot."
2.0,Shoe size fit rather well but the around the calf was very tight.
2.0,"Although beautiful to look at, it's very itchy with the glitter on the inside of the band.  Not worth it."
2.0,"Definitely order according to weight, not height!  I couldn’t get it past my ankles.  Gave 2 stars because it is cute."
2.0,"I've been searching for the best &#34; no bounce &#34; bra forever. I usually wear Glamorize which work pretty well but aren't all that attractive. I know I can never wear those cute little bralettes most woman wear.  I am a 38 DDD but wear a DD for extra support.  Sometimes I even go 40 DD because sports bra seem to run tight.  I really liked this bra when I took it out but when I put it on I changed my opinion.  If you are short,  dont bother. You cannot adjust the straps tight enough. I'm not paying to have it altered.  I guess it's back to glamorize..."
2.0,Had a flaw in the printing on sunflower
2.0,Feels and looks like a plastic toy. Not sure if it will withstand a big hit.
2.0,Broke within a few weeks of having it
2.0,"They were super cute but unfortunately the straps all popped off after one wash. Very sad, I really liked them :( cheap material."
2.0,"I was very disappointed with the packaging of the watch. I wanted it as a gift and I realize it’s not an expensive watch, but the box it came in was damaged and the watch itself seemed to be thrown into the box randomly without care, not mounted to a pedestal. The watch itself is operating fine. Would I buy it again? Not as a gift."
2.0,"When I looked at reviews for those particular shirts, it didn't bother me that the fabric is thin or that shirts shrink. I wanted to know, though, how much they shrink, so I could buy the right size, that will fit me after washing. So I went first with M, and it was too big, and stopped with S (my usual size). But I was very worried about the quality of the cut before shirts sewn. Will it be straight after washing or not? And now I know and that knowledge cost me only $23 🤦‍♀️.<br />It's ok. I'll wear shirts for some dirty farm work.<br />But they became buggy after the wash and the seams go from underarm and end close to the belly button (I'm exaggerating a bit, but you can see the picture), not on the side as they're suppose to.Very crooked line. And shirts that fit perfectly before washing now kind of wide and short."
2.0,"This is not a genuine Pandora charm.  With that said, it doesn't really look like the picture.  Just ok.  The little attached key is not nearly as glossy as the picture appears.  The heart is a tad misformed.  Wouldn't purchase it again if I had the choice."
2.0,These pants are not what I was expecting from the product photo.<br />The pants are thick and stiff.<br />I’m 5’5” and 140ish lbs and I normally wear a medium but sized down to a small.<br />They are still too big.<br />They looks super weird on me - not like the product photo at all.<br />I would suggest sizing down 2 sizes.<br />I never wear an XS but I guess thats what I needed for these to fit decent.
2.0,"Returned it because it didn't fit my body right. It was super cute, just NOT on me :}"
2.0,"The case itself is was what I was expecting. The money/bill holder/strap was a major disappointment. Numerous times my money/bills have slipped out entirely. Almost lost some money. If the case had a money clip attached to it, I think it would be a great overall design. I am returning the case."
2.0,"The carry on is okay, the fabric is okay.<br />The design makes the luggage stand out among the dozens of plain black bags.<br /><br />The problem is that either the wheels are too high or the &#34;feet&#34; on the bottom are not tall enough, causing the suitcase to lean forward when it's empty. Put some things in the carry-on, and over it goes, falling flat on the &#34;face&#34;. A real pain to travel with it.<br />There's about an inch of space between the footer and the floor. Too short!<br /><br />I would have returned it, but I needed it for my flight the very next day.<br />Also, the pull-out handle doesn't go quite high enough."
2.0,The front and back of earrings are colored but around the edges are not and are an ivory color which gives them a very very cheap look.
2.0,"Ordered 3 fleece shirts. Too small, couldn’t send back in time. I couldn’t leave the house."
2.0,Purchased a medium as a gift for my mom. It looked and fit like a small or xsmall. Runs small.
2.0,feel very regal in this dress. a lot more lightweight than you'd expect which is a good thing. I got the smallest size and it was still too large even with an oversized look. i'm generally a size 10 dress.
2.0,I’m disappointed the hat felt like plastic. It also was very large around the crown and stretched out. I plan to return.
2.0,"Super cute, but the headband arrived damaged and is unwearable, very disappointed"
2.0,"I'm returning this and just found out that they deduct $5.13 from the refund. Ugh.<br />I'm returning the dark purple because it's not made well. There are random parts of the sweater that show skin (sho you would need to wear something under it)<br />The sweater is soft, but who would want larger holes throughout?"
2.0,"Cheap look, wouldn't keep time and bulky"
2.0,Hoped for stronger compression. This is very thin and feels like a camisole.  Ordered to use for post surgery to reduce fluid in my torso.  Not going to get the job done with these.
2.0,Lighter than what the picture depicts.
2.0,The way the ban couldn’t clip good. No instructions how to do it.
2.0,I was hell returning it and you have to pay for the return almost 24.00$ not worth it
2.0,"I bought size 7/8 capris and they are really size 5T pants.  After attempting to weasel my string bean 8 year old into these i broke down and gave them to my neighbor's daughter who wears a 5T.  They fit her perfectly.  They are very soft and well made, which is the only reason they get any stars."
2.0,Wasn't good quality!
2.0,"If you are busty, go up a size. I did not like the way it looked in the back - the cute tassle fringe did not lay flat because of my breasts.So, I returned it."
2.0,This jacket was ok. But the way it was shipped in an air vacuumed bag.  Ruined it. Sent it back.
2.0,The dress falls flat. In the picture it looks fuller.
2.0,extremely painful to wear. the stuff plastic gives blisters.
2.0,miserable polarization- not what was advertised- glass quality is good<br />will return
2.0,the shirt is nice but the bottom part is baggy and weird in all the wrong places
2.0,Look nice and feel like they are made well.  Marked down becasue the uncorrected part of the lens seemed like a -1.00.  Worked perfect if I wore a pair of +1.00 readers underneath them.
2.0,"Title says it all. The material is incredibly thin, and the top elastic band rolls down constantly."
2.0,"This product looks like a good quality dress in the picture right? Wrong. When you receive it is the length of a shirt and had to pair it with a red skirt to make it ressemble to picture. It barely covered my bottom. The velvet material is also bad quality, it is very thing and gets scratched/easily becomes patchy. I would say if you have time save your money and purchase something a little better."
2.0,Much thinner than expected.
2.0,took three weeks to get it and its realy cheeply made and cheep looking
2.0,Size large - pants were perfect.  Size L - shirt - more like a med.  I couldn't wear a XL in pants to make the shirt fit.  It was very slim.
2.0,"The latch does not stay put, It takes a couple of tries before the clasp latch stays"
2.0,"this fit runs very small, I should have gone two sizes up and forget a wash and dry or you have to throw it away"
2.0,"lovely pattern, (polka dot) however material was cheap and see through."
2.0,It was a nice bracelet. I do recommend it
2.0,Shorter than I wanted and I short.  The sleeves are longer than I need but it works for he price.  If the material was the same as the sleeves I would purchase more.
2.0,"Material not as expected. I wanted denim, but this was like paper."
2.0,"Look good, but arrived bent. Not high quality, but about what I expected at this price."
2.0,Poor quality. Thin and see thru
2.0,"Ordered this watch to wear to a wedding. It looks fairly nice and is SUPER lite weight on your wrist. Unfortunately, I will now be returning it because it arrived broken. The metal button on the side (to adjust the time) was bent and sticking out at a weird angle. As soon as I touched it, it fell off. Now I'll have to make due with another watch I already own. The only other downside is that the face is plastic not glass so I imagine it scratches easily."
2.0,All 3 pairs broke :( green pair broke the second I took them out of the packaging
2.0,You get what you paid for. The ring broke immediately.
2.0,It was okay material. The fit was fine in the leg area but not on the back. It should have something to hold the back of overalls to your badly. Elastic or buttons in the waist would have been lovely but when I put these on they are great in the leg and butt area and even the length is good BUT  the back waist is just so baggy I WONT ever wear it anywhere where I would run a risk of seeing other people. Every women is not the same build even if they are the same size and a waistline for overalls with NO fashionable way to wear a belt should NEVER be ONE SIZE FITS ALL!
2.0,I ordered the pink one. Love it! So soft and nice edge finished. Lightweight and just what I was looking for. So I ordered a few other colors. They came with an unfinished/non sewn edge that rolls up and looks very cheap and to fray soon. Sending those back. Same company. Must be diff manufactures?
2.0,Beautiful but the opal fell out after 2 weeks.
2.0,Looked great and material was nice. The interior shorts did not lay flat. It was twisted and made the front pucker.
2.0,"Clasp did not open, did not give the option to exchange. It’s beautiful and good quality if I could wear it."
2.0,Size not the same as sizing chart
2.0,This dress was not as expected so I returned. Didn't like the fit.
2.0,The fabric quality wasn’t as expected
2.0,Bought these for my daughter but there was no way she could wear them. Far too small.
2.0,im an XL in all the colors of these ive tried except these. im a L in this color. definitely larger and made somewhere else. took a few returns to get the correct size.
2.0,Sized for a small person.  Gave to my petite daughter in law
2.0,Faded quickly and the tutu came apart. Luckily it was only worn for a short period of time.
2.0,The color is great! But the dress is very cheaply made!
2.0,The pendant itself is beautiful!<br />I was expecting a simple chain like the one that was shown but it has a weird twisted wire thing going on connecting it and is stamped 18KGP...? Makes me wonder if any of it is &#34;Sterling Silver&#34;. Guess I'll find out after I give it as a gift for Mother's Day
2.0,"After 2 months the purse started to turn green and blue. The clasps also broke easily . I literally used carribeaners as a replacement just to buy time to find the next purse I liked. It was of adequate size, but I dont carry much. It would not do for someone who likes to tote a lot of items."
2.0,Same colors of the same style. Plus small
2.0,"This bag is comfortable to wear, but the seams close to the zips are beginning to wear out. I've only used the bag for close to 2 months for hiking and school. Disappointed. Going back to Dakine bags."
2.0,"so considering I have pretty tiny hands, when I tried to get this over my hand it kept snapping no matter how many I bought! It is definitely not worth the money. It also makes your skin turn blue which is not healthy. Every single one I bought just kept on breaking. Do not waste your money on this."
2.0,I have been wearing the same style Crocs for the last two summers.  Liked them so much that I ordered a new pair and was deeply disappointed in the fit (much smaller foot bed). The entire sandal construction was flimsy compared to my original pair. Would not purchase this style in the future.
2.0,Photo is good at making this dress look better than it does. I had to wear a jacket around my waist to prevent my undies from showing
2.0,"Runs small small small.  Based on the size guide, I determined a size that should fit my daughter, but she couldn’t even get it on.  She is a small athletic build. Material seemed nice and firm, which would have been a plus if it fit."
2.0,"This bag used to be a great day hike/ 48 hour/ EDC bag... I bought a new one for my wife because she kept stealing mine to use on trips and hiking. So I thought the new one would be awesome... WRONG they removed the support/ stiffening in the back. There is still a metal hoop that outlines the back however the back pack hasno rigidity to it and you feel everything in the pack. The older models had a decent pad or something along with the metal hoop. I mean you might as well put a coat hanger hoop in a Jansport pack and call it a kelty.<br /><br />I used the original one from 2015 on many long hikes and never had complaints with carrying about 30 to 45 lbs of gear. This 2020 model just sucks, I've carried a full 40 ounce klean canteen, a small medical bag, some light trail food with a 5 inch knife and this thing collapses into an uncomfortable ball on your back.<br /><br />I've owned the original peregrine, and the raven 2500 I think is the name. Both have been great but Kelty is cutting corners big time. Being a former sailor I wouldn't even recommend the bag for buddies looking for a light gear bag. And it pisses me off that kelty says it's good to go for military use, dude I'd I can't walk down a pier with this on you're not humpin 20 miles with it on. Stay away from this bag, for serious use I'd look at osprey or maybe the strike 2400 or raven from kelty. Either way go try them on first don't screw up and order it online thinking the new one is just like the old one."
2.0,"It's PLASTIC, not stone"
2.0,Ordered XL.  Too small to wear.  Going to Goodwill.
2.0,"It's too big for most of the frames.<br />The clip has 2 little magnets to hold together with the cover. But, very easy to come off and not strong/stable enough.<br />Just not very good in design."
2.0,"I bought these hoping for find dish washing gloves.  These are more accurately described as cleaning gloves but I don't like them as dish washing gloves.  One criteria for great dish washing gloves is it can protect your hands when using hot water, these do not.  I had the hot water on and these gloves hardly protect from the heat.  Also, they smell and leaves your hands with a chemical smell.  Not fond of anything that smells in contact with food.<br />As the description states, these are cleaning gloves, but not good dish washing gloves."
2.0,"Great idea. Just not the quality as built spikes. 2 rounds of riding, and missing 2 on one side 1 on the other. Installed power directions."
2.0,"I love the look of these boots but I am usually a size USA 8, and I ordered a size 7.5 just to be safe. The boots are still considerably too large for me."
2.0,These come with the boots when you buy them. They're just your average insoles. If you need something heavy-duty for construction work.. buy another brand that's better quality or get the heated ones that redwings sells.
2.0,looks better in photo
2.0,"These are very short. If you're petite- they would be perfect, but I'm 5'9&#34; and they are more of a capri pant. Other wise great"
2.0,Daughter prefers a sturdy cotton feel.  These just don't seem like they'll last very long.
2.0,The packaging is not sealed. When I connect it to my phone it makes a weird static sound sometimes..
2.0,"This dress seemed like it would be so comfortable, flattering, and affordable. Turns out you get what you pay for. It is awkwardly tight in some places (esp the bust). I am a size M, 5'5 and this dress just looked horrible."
2.0,"They were so flared, that they won't fit in my ears. I have to gauge 2 more sizes to get them to fit."
2.0,Color is quite close to picture but fabric quality is not good at all.felt very disappointing.
2.0,"brought this bracelet and thought it was a pretty good deal and it's study, but then within a few weeks it started turning colors which Sterling silver S925 shouldn't do.  I would have embarrassed myself if I actually gifted this."
2.0,Love the matte black finish and looks durable enough. My only problem is that it appears a little too big for my watch. I have 22mm band and purchased the 22mm buckle but looks way too big for it. Definitely takes away from the value and look. My advice buy 2 buckles because it isn't a perfect fit all the time.
2.0,The bottoms are cute and fit well (cheeky) but the top has way too much fabric and not flattering at all.
2.0,Gold is painted on with low quality.<br />Bracelet is aluminum.
2.0,"I was looking for an alternative to standard masks, but these were so tight around my neck that they triggered my rampant claustrophobia.  Luckily I have a friend with a really skinny neck who benefited from my purchase."
2.0,"These shoes run small. I wear an 8 or 7.5 so i got the 8. My toes are rubbing against the shoe and isn’t comfortable. These look ok but I wouldn’t wear them out at night. This is definitely a daytime/casual boot,"
2.0,"Very attractive and easy to put together/adjust. I wanted this band to work because I really enjoy the look and feel — but ceding my arm, opening a car door, moving, walking, etc and it opens and falls off! I’m worried I’ll lose my fitbit. Now I have to buy a different band. Very disappointed."
2.0,Came with a defect in one of the lenses that can't be removed.
2.0,Totally disappointed in these.  I wanted to add a few wisps of my mother's hair but the holes are super tiny and even with the needle (super flimsy and bent outta shape at the touch)  and funnel it came with (which is too big to fit the hole anyway)... It sucked.  I spent half hour trying to get a few wisps of hair into the hole. #fail. When I tried to screw the piece back together it came apart in my hands.  I can't even wear it for fashion purposes Bec the space in the clasp would mean it could fall off at anytime.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that  it was really pretty and came packaged in a nice pink velvet bag with accessories (that albeit are useless) but it's the thought that counts. I guess ... If ur looking for a necklace for fashion purposes this will work I guess ...but does not hold any ashes or anything as the opening is shallow and difficult to navigate with a funnel that's too big for the opening anyway.
2.0,The buttons were awful. I will never get a button up winter parka again. Stick with zippers.
2.0,Size was way too small. Waist band was very unattractive. Not nearly as flowy as the photo indicates
2.0,Broke already....  only used for 2 weeks :-( 😔
2.0,Material not thick like a good quality legging. Spandex type legging w no support.
2.0,Super comfy - but not squat proof - or even bending over proof…great for a target run but not for the gym.
2.0,"I thought that this would be normal sweatshirt material but it is not. It feels wierd and cheap, almost like a halloween costume. It's super cute and I'm sad it wasn't better quality."
2.0,Does not fit true to size - very small
2.0,"Pretty, but the material is very thin, truly not worth the money it costs...."
2.0,"I was very disappointed as I was expecting 6 pr of ankle socks not the 12 sneaker socks that I received.  I expected them to be higher.  These will be fine for this summer, but I can not wear them here this winter as they're way too short - just barely above the heel.  Guess I thought I was getting something longer with a cuff.  consequently, I'll have to take a day to go shopping around town in order to get what I want."
2.0,The material is weird. It’s like rip stop nylon like a track suit or parachute. And the fit is weird.  I got a 2L that should’ve been a 2x and it’s only and L and it fits weird. My daughter can maybe wear it as a coverup this summer but it’s just odd.
2.0,The gloves are very difficult to get on. The lining bunches. Might be easier for an older child but didnt work for a 2 1/2 year old.
2.0,"The right side of the shirt was the correct size. The left side was larger. The sleeve, the shoulder seam, were incorrectly pieced together. You could visibly see the difference.<br />I was not confident to order a replacement.<br />I would have liked to have kept the shirt."
2.0,The pants are cheaply made. A button was hanging on when I received them.
2.0,Too tiny for the price and the design is not vivid enough. I loved the Egyptian label with hieroglyphics more.
2.0,"Very cute and stylish, but turns your finger colors very quickly"
2.0,Nice size and seems like nice quality. My only issue is the pendant doesn’t look exactly like the picture. They photoshopped out the piece of the pendant that the chain runs through. It doesn’t look as nice as I expected but for the price I’m keeping it.
2.0,gave them away did not fit like a large
2.0,Screen cover scratches easy and thick- makes for difficult screen operation
2.0,Blue sewing pattern lines were all over the front and back of the leotard. How does a company even sell something like this?<br /><br />The material is also less stretchy than anticipated and the skirt layers are translucent (I expected opaque).<br /><br />Returned and greatly disappointed.
2.0,Not as described. They looked old and used. The back prong doesn't not even fit into the earring. The need is not smooth and thicker at the tip so you can't even put th back piece on.
2.0,It's made of cheap material.  The top is a bit different than I expected.  It's way more orange and not peach as I thought.
2.0,Not leather like advertised. disappointed.
2.0,"Well I was super excited because I saw these somewhat-cheap DMC pendants, and that they also had the Vergil (blue) one. So I ordered both the Vergil and Dante ones, which mind you, the Dante one cost more even though its the same exact thing just a different color. I was pleased when it shipped the day after I purchased them, but they still took about two weeks to arrive. LET ME JUST SAY. THEY'RE VERY SMALL. AND PLASTIC. I'm not pleased, but they will work for now I guess."
2.0,This is a cute ring but it tarnished bad after a month
2.0,Cute top but it shrunk so badly after first wash that I haven’t worn it since
2.0,Te size like for kids.
2.0,"The fit is off on this. I’m a size M in all clothes and orders a medium and it was too small. The bust was especially small and I don’t think even a large would work for me (34 D). The fabric is thin, but cute. I would be fine with the fabric if the dress fit properly."
2.0,Loved the color.  The problem is the straps broke when pulling out from the package.  Had to do every one!!!
2.0,these glasses were too small for my face so I returned them.
2.0,I had to give this item away it was too small and the return funds were too much...
2.0,Beautiful necklace but wings wouldn't open to put the photo inside. Returned it.
2.0,"I bought these shoes  just 2 months ago and I liked them, but the espadrille woven  portion of the shoes had completely separated from the rest of the shoe while I was walking afew days back."
2.0,REGU REGU
2.0,"Well, they are warm, but the lining in each finger makes them feel like little individual sausages and make it frankly hard for my fingers to bend. I need gloves I can use my hands in; these aren't keepers for me."
2.0,Does not fit modern day wrap sunglasses like Arnette or Oakley.  Would love it if it did secondary to expensive glasses and looking for a hard case.  But the description is deceiving.  Do not buy unless it's for smaller Rx glasses!
2.0,Shipped fast but very poor quality
2.0,"They are not for me, they could be better.. I really don't like the plastic back pieces.. They get weak after a while and do fall out. Plus the rhinestones are small so they go thru the hole. I have a normal size piecing, and they go thru."
2.0,The glasses are definitely lightweight but too wide for my head.  They shouldn't be considered a women's frame.  Even my husband felt they were even too big for him.
2.0,Fabric VERY thin.
2.0,"Not worth the money & way too high for the materials used. Being a JEWELRY MAKER I DUPLICATED THEM FOR LESS THAN 1/8 OF WHAT THIS SELLER IS CHARGING. These materials were cheap looking & cheaply made, I encourage Amazon to rethink this seller, they have always been about their buying public & customers to try & fool them at a fair price. I bought these to see how good the materials were & I found them to be third rate at best. I was amazed Amazon didn't scrutinize quality vs. cost with this seller better."
2.0,"This is what my bracelet looked like immediately after opening it and taking it out of the box. This is not a quality piece and I would highly discourage anyone buying this bracelet, especially as a gift."
2.0,This way extremely boxed shaped and too wide everywhere colors were kinda drab and dull
2.0,"Well, there’s no patina or turquoise on the lotus and it’s not on a chain as pictures. It’s on a beaded elastic band. :/"
2.0,the reason i am giving this item the low rating is that it is easy to scratch the exterior and it is not as large as it looks. it looks cheap and i can tell that this would not hold up very well. I threw it in the garbage. Sorry but it is not worth buying.
2.0,Was very small even though I order a large
2.0,Looks way better in the photos. The tie is weird and doesn’t sit right. May be cute on a diff body type or for maternity. Not a fit for me.
2.0,This shirt looks good in pic but is cheaply made and came about 2 sizes to small. The company was nice and gave me almost 50% refund not to return the shirt. I excepted and gave it to my wife. Lol
2.0,"I wear 34"" pants comfortably and ordered the belt they said fits 32-34 waists. The belt can barely touch ends around my waist. The number on the belt matches what I ordered, so I guess their numbering system is screwey. Nice that their return procedure was easy, but I didn't shop around and buy it because I wanted to return it."
2.0,They were beautiful. The gold ones were the right size but the purple were an extra large!! Disappointed with that.
2.0,Really big on my head. The chin strap also looks really weird. One of the rare cases where even stuffing things into the mask won't make it fit right. Don't buy unless you have a big head
2.0,"Sadly, less then the quality then I needed...Couldnt return, took me to long to install."
2.0,"Love the shape and style do not love that they came with a large scratch on the lense, didn't have enough time to wait to return and wait to be reshipped"
2.0,Cute little cheer outfit but the dark black smudge across the front doesn’t make me real happy. My daughter is disappointed and so am I.. At least it just a Halloween outfit.
2.0,"Pretty color but, kept falling down my shoulder"
2.0,"The opening of those shoes were too narrow for us to be able to put them on our little one (and we ordered one size up) . Also, there's a sharp seam in the back of the shoes that felt quite painful to the touch. I don't think my little one would have been able to wear the shoes even if we had been able to put them on her."
2.0,"Thought this was a solid mask but it’s pleated. When you pull it out the design does not show up clearly. Disappointed as this was a gift. Material is soft and weight feels fine, but not what the picture shows.:("
2.0,"Cheap.  Okay fabric.  Only has a wire inside to maintain shape.  As soon as I put it around my head, it slips. Picture looks better quality than it is."
2.0,"Incredibly disappointed in the image on the shirt.  It’s almost sticky and discolored with black on it, also covered in excess thread.  This is supposed to be my daughter’s 1st day of school outfit, now I don’t know. We have bought other items from this company and never had this issue."
2.0,"Initially really happy with this dress, but after the first time I washed it it pilled and stretched. It came with a cute bracelet that I wore for a few days but then that broke. Not the best."
2.0,"These sunglasses look great, but the tips of the earpieces are sharp and they stab your temples when putting them on. Super uncomfortable."
2.0,"Too small, and cheap material. I returned it."
2.0,Too small... But granddaughter love the hair wrap. Especially the big button
2.0,This was not a deep pink like the picture. It was more of a very light dusted pink and it came without the bow. There is just the belt loops clearly visible with no belt.
2.0,Fits like a small
2.0,I am larger on top so I had to go larger in size. It ended up being too big and not supportive enough so I returned it.
2.0,"Beautiful Shoe. Order a whole size up. I ordered a size 10, it for like a 9"
2.0,Ordered in my usual size but was way too snug and they felt like a B not a C cup. Also has a pointy appearance when worn
2.0,The sizing must be really off. I ordered a medium but actual item looked like a child’s medium.
2.0,"I received the 2 dresses that I ordered. But... the skirts on the dress, hung uneven.  They were poorly sewed crooked  and one side was higher than the other?  The Ruffles were made of Tulle and was not finished on the edges... just Raw Scizzor Cuts.  Order again?  NO!"
2.0,The color of the scarf in person did not match the picture...
2.0,My grandson thought it would open but doesnt
2.0,"Normally wear an Xl always order 2x on Amazon cause they all fit me but this does not fit in a 2x it’s cute, I might have to get a 3 or 4 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️. Cute and looks like the pictures it’s just the sizing"
2.0,"I didn't like the cotton-y/wool-like feel to the leggings, made it feel too hot to wear even when it wasn't that hot of a day. Also if you have an ass at all, this thing struggled to get over my butt while fitting well all of everywhere else."
2.0,The dress is cute but very long.  It is also very thin so it’s really see through.
2.0,Some of the earrings are so small
2.0,"I returned these - frames were very light & flimsy, and the color was no way near as vibrant as in pix."
2.0,Kind of really thin
2.0,Too large. I was expecting them to be big due to oversized being in the description but I looked ridiculous wearing these. I can't imagine them being flattering for many people. They covered half of my face and made me look insect like. The only thing I liked was the color of the frames. I can't comment on the durability as they never made it out of the junk drawer long enough to test it.
2.0,Was this used or something before my purchase? There are so many orange stains and random dark spots all over the dress!!! Very upsetting!
2.0,I was disappointed to find that such a nice product fails to conform to correct size standards. My size 11 product fits like a size 9. This after it cost me upwards of $40 and I had it carried over all the way to Africa by a friend. What a shame!!!
2.0,weak velcro
2.0,"I was excited about this shoe, as it looked super steady, but it way too big after ordering his normal size! He wears a 13, it my older kid who wear a 2/3. I liked them though, so I am going to try again"
2.0,The quality was ok but these gloves legitimately smell like tuna fish! The odor from the gloves sticks to your hands and even after a month the smell hasn’t faded one bit!! Gross!
2.0,Love the design but the short was thin material and was small
2.0,"It works well to align the neck and shoulders. However, the fabric holds body odors even after washing. I still haven't found a product to solve this problem. It may render the shirt unusable."
2.0,I dont like the fabric and how it fits.<br />Not happy with it.
2.0,Fit and style are not great.
2.0,True to size though
2.0,It came and it was completely different but I'll still wear it so 2 stars
2.0,"For the price it's fine. It's not super high quality. You'll get one summers use out of it, maybe less if you swim in salt water because that will definitely stretch out the material. The top is really small, the under wires don't meet evenly in the center of the top. I'm 5'6&#34;, 155 lbs, a loose size 8 in jeans and a 36/38 D or DD cup. The bottoms fit fine, but the top I gave to a girlfriend who is MAYBE a C-cup. I'll wear a different top that I found at Target with the bottoms. For just needing something that I can wear while sitting at pool parties, it works."
2.0,The picture looks bad. Won't even wear it. You can't tell it is a book
2.0,The fabric of this was thicker than I was expecting and felt nice. I expected loose but It was oversized and had no shape to it. I'm a size 10/12 and ordered size large.
2.0,"I bought another bra from this brand which had cups almost too large (same 30D size), so I feel like this is a cheap brand with inconsistent sizing. Would not buy again. So you can compare and try to choose the size that fits you: I fit 30D pretty consistently across most major brands, Wacoal fits me best. This was a smaller 30 band size, more along the lines of a Natori 30"" band. The cups however fit more like a 30C, not a 30D. Hope that helps."
2.0,bought and wore once.
2.0,"These jammies are very soft and stretchy, but shrink and appear misshapen and unattractive after wash."
2.0,Not regular medium
2.0,"This is great underwear for the gym but even in size small, it is much too big to offer any support."
2.0,Print on the back transferred to my trucks leather seats during hot NY summer.
2.0,Looks are deceiving. It looks and feels like it’s made from doll clothes material. Not at all what I thought I ordered.
2.0,The blouse might look ok with a belt and lots of necklaces.  The fabric quality and basic design matches the low price.  I wore it once and have  put it in the recycle bin.
2.0,"The body of the bra is very soft. The cups are nearly flat. There’s no room. They just smash you. And, I’m only a C cup."
2.0,i wanted to love these and hoped for them to be fashionable ish but comfortable but opposite- harsh fabric with no stretch.
2.0,"Its a nice watch, its just way way to big, you have to be 6'4 husky to pull it off.  I'm 5'10 athletic, it looks like a dinner plate on my wrist"
2.0,"They look gorgeous when you get them in, but they fell out easily and were VERY difficult to get put together"
2.0,Secure but very cheaply made. The ends were frayed and after a day of wear the finish is worn off the edges exposing a grey pot metal.
2.0,well its cute but it broke in a week so not worth buying. and i dont even do exercise or anything is should have asted longer
2.0,Awkward shape and size. Returned.
2.0,"This scarf is so cute, but it is literally too silky. It will NOT stay in my hair. I have to use Bobby puns to keep it in place, but it still falls off eventually."
2.0,"This is a quality product, however I don't think the seller noticed that I was supposed to get 3 individual horseshoe earrings. I overlooked it too.  I forgot the listing is for 3 pieces. Everything else is fine. The price wasn't high, and it arrived on time, so I can't complain very much. It's nice septum jewelry if you think smaller diameter looks better for your septum.<br /><br />If I received all 3 pieces, I would have given this 5 stars.<br /><br />I think the seller needs to pay better attention to individual transactions, or possibly write a new listing."
2.0,This fabric cannot be saved from the deep wrinkles and hideous quality
2.0,Regret to buy this shirt. poorly designed.
2.0,"i am 5'8 and it was too short in the back, i ts not as drapery as it looks either its pretty much a rectangle of fabric with some sleeve in it. seems to be pretty high quality fabric for the price though."
2.0,"The font in the sample picture appears to be a script font, unlike the font I received. If this is the same font, a lettering chart should have been provided. The monogram also appears much smaller than what is pictured. I’m disappointed in this purchase."
2.0,"If you’re a 40DD and up, don’t buy this. Definitely not for busty women seeing as how I had a good amount of spillage. Also, for some reason it’s pretty short; almost like it’s for someone with a short torso like a little person and I’m 5’3” already. Disappointed because this was a very sexy and unique swimsuit."
2.0,Soo pretty but broken 😔
2.0,I found the cups were too small
2.0,"The metallic Covering of the nose ring becomes, flaky after two days of wearing pealing the color off"
2.0,The photo provided makes the shirt look like a slim fit shirt when it is actually regular fit. Because the shirt in general also was a bit large I think that I should have bought a size down as well. The shirt then had to be taken to a seamstress to be adjusted.
2.0,I have purchased several pairs of these pants in the past. They have really held up so I felt comfortable ordering two more pair. Mistake! The small and comfortable strip of elastic in the waistband has now been replaced with just about the largest and most uncomfortable piece of elastic that I’ve ever had in a waistband. These new pairs are very uncomfortable.
2.0,Way to thin not what I was looking for.
2.0,"I requested silver metal instead of the gold and seller said ok, but it was silver.  Had to return it."
2.0,"I was VERY disappointed when I received this keychain.. the preview of the keychain is shown as black with silver and yet the one I received was all silver.. but on a brighter note, I’m glad my brother liked it"
2.0,I liked that the pack contains a variety of bracelets. The major negative is that 3 of them have already broken or completely come apart.
2.0,"I ordered several pairs of these recently and was really dissapointed that they were all dirty or stained dark.  However I did give them 2 stars because they were very prompt with refunding my money and not giving me a hard time about the return.  They were really cute, but not what I expected as far as quality."
2.0,The fit seemed comfortable for the first couple of minutes then rode at least a 1/4 of the way up on the 'girls.' The shoulder straps aren't too tight (actually they are almost loose) and they all do the same thing. If you like to constantly be tugging and pulling your bra down you'll love these. :)
2.0,I don't usually like flip fops because I keep stepping out of them and they don't stay on my feet well.  I thought these might be different with the bindings around the big toe but it didn't make a difference.  I stepped out of these just as always and they didn't stay centered on my heal either.  I returned them.
2.0,"Loved the look, flimsy hinge...purchased in January 2018 BROKEN in March 2018!!!!!"
2.0,"Cute, but too small to wear."
2.0,"I had previously ordered an L, but it was way too big for me. I reordered a Medium size this time, but it was a bit of a tight fit. I kept it anyway, but after the first wash, it got discolored, and shrunk quite a bit."
2.0,Go a size up - not for girls with a large chest.
2.0,Its not as pretty in person as it was in the pic....it does feel like I have wonder womans bracelet on really disappointing it was so pretty in the pic.
2.0,"The color is off. Not the original color of Spock's shirt. Fans will notice that easily as I did.  Really wanted blue not teal looking...also Originally the site said LAST ONE , suddenly they have more. HMMM ."
2.0,The elastic is too tight and small. Awkward cut.
2.0,Very wrinkly!
2.0,They were way too small!
2.0,[[VIDEOID:129065de43c7ca9ba1bff3f34dd817ac]] Heart broken…. Ws going to use this for local Fundraiser  shedding all over… the eye in mask is torn… the gloves are super small and already dirty… an the slippers?? To mall Santa hats so not worth $100
2.0,The description was pants and sports bra. What we received was bike shorts and a sports bra. Didn't have time to return as it was a Christmas gift for family visiting from a different country. Very disappointed.
2.0,"If they add Gusseted armpits, it would be awesome.  BJJ pants/MMA shorts  have a gusseted crotch.  I expected the armpits to be gusseted for mobility.  I hung dry it next to my  modal cotton shirt, the Modal cotton shirt was drying faster than the rash guard......Interesting"
2.0,"It’s just fine, super cheap fabric, but okay to wear for a casual outfit with leggings, wouldn’t buy again if I knew how the fabric felt"
2.0,the slit is WAY high if you're 5'6&#34;<br />I had to wear another skirt underneath it =(
2.0,It was way too big. It had a horrible chemical smell. One of the pockets had the lining sewed all bunched up so the pocket was  useless. It was a cute purse in spite of all the things I mentioned. I'm  returning it.
2.0,The 'c' is missing from 'niece'
2.0,Hated the way it looks.  It wasn't long enough!
2.0,"Difficult to attach band to Apple Watch Series 5 - slide in was very difficult and hard to remove. Other than that, looks like nice quality band, and I would have kept it if it would have attached easily/correctly."
2.0,Much shorter than pictured
2.0,Run small...
2.0,"SIZING IS WAAAYYY WRONG First I am a professional pattern designer, so I know drafting and sizing. This dress is sized soo small. A size large would fit my twelve year old, but my 16 year old who wears a large in everything else? NOPE, couldn't squeeze if she tried. Now we are left scrambling to find a homecoming dress because there's not enough time to order a new one."
2.0,Online it looks really cute but once you see it in person is not as nice. It is way too big and not adjustable. I would not recommend this to any one.
2.0,"I bought these vital 2.0 leggings and their counter part in the vital 2.0 shorts as a more affordable alternative to the gym shark vital 2.0  leggings and shorts. The fit and compression was great. They both fit comfortably and allowed for movement while staying tight around all the right places; however, when I squatted in them, you could see the entirety of my butt and underwear. They were so sheer that you could see the tone of my skin through the fabric. I was really excited when I found this brand and style on Amazon, but unfortunately, they weren’t what I was looking for."
2.0,So small had to return
2.0,I probably ordered the wrong cut. I usually buy them from TJmacks and they have a tighter fit.<br />I thought the fabrics I opted was not as nice.
2.0,"The fit around the head is fine, but its not slouchy in the back.  So it doesn't have the 'look' of a slouchy beanie hat.<br />That's why I'm disappointed.  Its also rather thin, so not a hat I'd use skiing or snowboarding.  Wind will go right through it."
2.0,"It is a beautiful necklace, looks just like the picture, but the quality is exactly what you would expect an item of this price &#34;made in China&#34;, would be..It has that metal smell I heavily dislike, I think I may wear it once or twice to at least make myself feel better about  the purchase :("
2.0,"Fits well.  Really comfortable riding, but it snags too easily.  After 3 rides, it looks like an old shirt."
2.0,"My wrist are too small, do not get if you have small wrist"
2.0,This bracelet disappears on your wrist and it’s so short.  No much of a piece of jewelry.
2.0,They roll down at waist
2.0,I was disappointed with this it turned so fast after a week !!! I sell laminated gold that lasts longer
2.0,"I typically wear an XL in tops, dresses, etc.  Have not encountered any problems with that size.  When I ordered this dress,  I could not imagine that there would be any problem.  It was a swing style, and not fitted, so I was not expecting any issue with it fitting.  However, across the bust the dress is too tight.  So disappointing."
2.0,"Not very good quality, and they should send a pair of the black pieces. Is too short"
2.0,Absolutely beautiful and worth the wait
2.0,[[VIDEOID:3dd5ac113e8487f8fc504143600a1dd8]] It was cheaply made and what was displayed online is not what I received!  it’s frustrating that I have to drive back to Kohl’s to return it! SO it’s so not worth it & it’s frustrating that not only it wasn’t the same exact earrings but one of the pairs is different than the other please see pictures and videos attached.
2.0,Careful made small
2.0,DId not workout as planed
2.0,"After owning this wallet for five months, I can finally say that it's not the right wallet for me. The main problem is that it's just too big. It's hard to take out of my back pocket and it's too much to sit on. It has a lot of nice bells and whistles and fancy means to store lots of items. However, it just gets more and more misshapen with each new item. The last straw was when my cards started to crack. Now I need a new wallet and a driver's license."
2.0,"Wanted to use this shirt for upcoming rotator cuff surgery, but it's going to have to go back, sadly. The sizing is really way too small. You need to go up a size for shoulder surgery, so I went up to a 3 x hoping it would be really big but it's barely big enough. I would have had to get a 5 x for proper comfortable fit. Also, guess I did not read the fabric, but it is all synthetic and wanted natural material so as to be cool and not worry about irritation. The snaps are freezing cold on the skin, so there would be no way I could wear it even if it came in a larger size. Also, the neckline runs small as well. I think that V-neck will work better."
2.0,I gave them to my 9 year old grandson.  They seemed to fit him...though I bought them for my 86 year old husband
2.0,the buttons to clip together and make stay on broke within the first 2 uses what a waste
2.0,Picture better than real life.  I was stunned to see how small it is. I was very disappointed. Won't buy from them again.
2.0,It’s cozy and a great length but the quality could be a lot better. It will do the job for one season but I don’t know if it will hold on for two🤷🏽‍♀️ I bought it on sale so I’m ok with that
2.0,I had to return the pocket was sewn wrong
2.0,"The sizing was very off. I’d ordered two of the same brand boots in the same size just different styles and they fit fine. But this pair was narrow and small, yet marked the same sz 11 m as the others. Pretty sure it’s mislabeled. I hope this review will help someone fix that.  Also I ordered a pair of this brand from Zappos and the zipper was signature La Canadienne but the cheaper ones froM Amazon don’t have that signature zipper and the name on the sole is different font. Makes me wonder"
2.0,"Once again, a dress that is supposed to be XL but fits as a size 10.  Even smaller than the  other.  Cannot return because it is from China.  It would cost more to return than to keep and gift to someone else."
2.0,The pants were WAY to tight around my calves and super loose on my waist using the pocket just made them fall down
2.0,"I bought this robe because I liked the colors which are quite lovely.  The fabric is soft but not very thick.  It is not a winter robe, but a  summer or beach robe.  It is also short.  I have since ordered a robe in the same size from another brand, and it is about 6"" longer.  The  tag says it is made in China and says to ""wash manual"" which I'm assuming means by hand and ""hang to dry"".  This wasn't explained in the info.  I certainly don't want a robe that needs special handling.  The main reason for the low rating is the packaging.  This comes shrink wrapped in a small package.  Rather than folding it neatly, it's as if someone wadded it up and then shrink wrapped it.  It arrives extremely wrinkled and the wrinkles wouldn't hang out.  This robe was a disappointment and is being returned."
2.0,I ordered these earrings once before and they worked well for my cartilage ear piercings. But the second time they came completely tarnished!!!
2.0,I purchased two different brands for comparison.  This on has a delayed reaction and is dimmer than the Wasserstein one which costs $6 less.
2.0,"this is such a cute ring, I recieved it 2 days after ordering and it's small cute and playful. my only problem with it, is that I recieved the ring without the small ball so it's nearly impossible to wear it like that (obviously)."
2.0,"Not hypoallergenic. Gave my daughter a terrible infection had to toss them and she wears all kids of earrings cheap and real, these weren’t great she was very upset cause they were cute."
2.0,Too large for my calf
2.0,I did not see a difference for night driving...
2.0,"These are super cute and inexpensive so I wanted to love them. However, you get what you pay for with these. The black part that goes onto the glasses comes off quickly. Also the thing to adjust them becomes stuck and no longer moves which deems them now useless. These did not help my 5 year old keep her glasses on at all. We've only had them a month and are down to one usable one."
2.0,"Though these are labeled &#34;men's&#34;, they are too small for a man. I have small head and face, too. These should not be labeled &#34;men's&#34;. But otherwise they look great, are constructed great. That's the only reason I gave 2 stars."
2.0,This wallet is much too small for U.S. currency and quite slick to handle. Hubby complained every time he tried to remove from his pocket that it was slick/slippery making it hard to pull from pants pockets.
2.0,"I am amazed at the too-small reviews! I am 38DD and first ordered a XXL according to size chart.  while they may look small just out of the package, they fit HUGE and sloppy because the fabric is way too stretchy.  to get the proper fit and some support, a size L is plenty large enough for a 38DD. I  am  thinking a M would even fit better."
2.0,It makes sense why you get so many stud in a package because they fall out so easily and you fly through all the jewery ....
2.0,Too heavy. Pulled my earlobes down
2.0,"This dress is not embroidered. I specifically bought it because the listing says it is embroidered, but it is a cheap screen print."
2.0,This is adorable but both the wand and the flower crown broke within 3 hours of play. The wand didn’t even last 30 minutes. I’m fairly crafty so I’m able to fix/repair/improve but it still makes for a sad 3 year old on her birthday.
2.0,"It is actually pretty but surprisingly tiny, it’s pretty but omg small"
2.0,"I loved the length, design, everything. Below the chest was perfect but the chest and especially the arms were WAY too tight. I couldn’t even move around without feeling like I was going to rip a hole in it."
2.0,This is so cute and I was excited for it. However the owl is kinda big and it was physically painful to have in my ear.
2.0,You get what you pay for.  A very stiff band
2.0,"Weird fit,the turtle neck part was huge. Seller was nice and helpful with return"
2.0,"Looks great and easy installation, but after a month the silicone has torn off the pin :("
2.0,made to cheep for the price.
2.0,Too tight!  Made my ears hurt.
2.0,"The shoe did not fit, it was too wide."
2.0,This return is partially my fault.<br />I didn't read the fabric content.<br />Nevertheless you could see at seam where they stopped the print pattern.<br />The material appeared to be bathing suit material.<br />BUYER BEWARE the only thing ankara is the pattern.
2.0,"Should have done my homework, these were smaller than I expected. They're pretty, but smaller than expected. Satisfaction migt depend on what you want. For a clip- on earring for my daughter, I would have thought they would be larger."
2.0,makes me look so large.  The return policy was not good and I was unable to return unless I lost most of my money
2.0,Do not really stay on well. But great price and easy to use
2.0,"I got this product pretty quick which was nice, however it really stank so I hand washed it, kind of lost the soft fluff of the fleece. The water turned black and the sent didn't go away. So I did throw it in the washer, NOT the dryer, air dried it. When it was finally dried it still held an unpleasant odor. I could try washing it again but I've lost interest."
2.0,they roll down if I wear them as true compression socks. Cute design but they are useless and a waste of my money
2.0,I ordered a size medium for my son based on the size chart. When they arrived a Medium is actually two sizes smaller. A medium is an 8 and not a 10-12.<br />My son loves the pants and they fit well enough for sleeping. He wanted to keep them anyway. I don’t know if I’ll order a second pair as an XL or go with a different brand.
2.0,A little disappointed that the top is black and white stripe to go with the navy and white polka dots. They don’t match!  They both looked navy in the photos:( Will be returning.
2.0,"It's ok. The fit is great! It's cute and comfortable... But lint and hair cling to it pretty bad! Also, it is alot more white on the animal print than I expected. I thought it would be more tan. Also, it faded even more when I washed it. The front pocket is small and kinda awkward. It's tiny and right in the front, not like the picture at all. I can tell this one is a cheaper knock off than the more expensive one I saw. I'm 155lbs, 5'4"", I got a large and am happy with the fit. I am keeping this one, but if I could do it again, I'd spend the extra $10, and get the legit one."
2.0,"The shirt actually looks cute, but for some reasons does not wear well. The shirt would not stay as off the shoulder and kept popping up. Very uncomfortable to wear. Disappointed! Will have to return. ;("
2.0,i just love it but hurt a bit around neck
2.0,This is very low quality fabric/ it is low grade polyester that scratches like crazy/ even after washing.
2.0,it is not a matter of being to large or to small. The issue is the overall fit.....don't like it.
2.0,Very uncomfortable. Bought these for a wedding and I end up barefoot during the entire reception. Disappointed.
2.0,Top runs too small. The size chart does not match the top at all.
2.0,"Es bonita pero me siento muy decepcionada porque compré este producto confiando en las medidas que tienen publicadas en la página, pero resulta que son falsas, el producto es más pequeño de lo publicado.  Rectifiquen por favor las medidas correctas para que otras personas no sean engañadas"
2.0,"The chain appears just fine, but the picture is dim/weak and the wolf looks like a little blob not a wolf silhouette. It was supposed to be a b-day gift for my niece. I had to return it, such a shame."
2.0,Had to return because the zipper was broken. My niece was heartbroken. Overall she loved the shoes.
2.0,I don't like it. I give them a way.
2.0,"its not for outside flip flops, it will burn your feet"
2.0,"Came bent, other than that you get what you paid for. Medium sized black studs"
2.0,It's cute trendy but runs very large
2.0,I returned this because it was awkward and fit wrong. I’m 5’4 and 135lbs and ordered a medium but it was just...weird. I AM however very large busted so that could have been it.
2.0,Heavy and uncomfortable—ankle lacing tedious—foot is pitched forward cramming the toe to the edge. Plenty of room at the heel so larger size would likely have done the same. Return was very easy.
2.0,"I like the water washed appearance and fit, but that is it. This product disintegrated on me slowly. I had a similar pair in black that I flat out returned and had replaced. It seems like a 50/50 shot of this product lasting more than a month versus falling apart. The last pair did this to me too. This effect does not occur with their solid color schemes though...so I think that this is a part of the process in dying the material."
2.0,Anyone else not able to unscrew the top? It's really frustrating because neither of them will come off...
2.0,"With this thin material all body imperfections will show through this material.  Additionally, the cut seems a bit off."
2.0,Not tshirt material. Will have you sweating
2.0,"I'm heavy head sweater, I've been using these for several months. They don't absorb sweat well, its ok, however the plastic lining on the inside has turned in to a beige/pink color. It looks gross. I'm not sure if I will keep using them."
2.0,too small for my phone
2.0,Way too small.  No way it was the size ordered.  Could not dress up for my fundraiser due to this not fitting and not enough time to get a new one.
2.0,There was maybe 2-3 decent quality brackets in this bunch. Even one of those broke first time wearing. Very cheap quality and will not last.
2.0,"It arrived in a timely manner.  However, I purchased them since they advertised having a pocket but three different people tried to find the pocket on the first two pairs and there were NO pockets."
2.0,The sleeves too tight but lovely dress
2.0,The curve is wrong for my Ray-Bans so I sent it back. They refunded me.
2.0,Fabric bad style n size is ok.<br />Ordered small my size
2.0,"Considering this was Big Man's clothing, there wasn't enough &#34;rise&#34; to stay up comfortably...maybe stronger elastic would help.  Just always seem to want to &#34;creep&#34; down unless pulled up so far I was at risk of becoming an alto.  They were great in every other way.  I had contemplated ordering the next larger size but glad I didn't as there's no way the weak elastic would have held them up."
2.0,The only problem the arms are too tight.
2.0,"These were way too big and the fit was loose and gaping, despite following the size chart. I ended up donating them to the thrift store. They also attracted lint and cat hair within mere seconds of trying on!"
2.0,They showed up on time. Feels so soft inside. Look cheap though and omg way to small. I ordered a 2x but there's no room to stretch and they fit my neighbor a size 8-10 and was tight on her. Cheap look.
2.0,"Way too large on the torso part of the shirt and the arms are too small.  Quality seems just okay, to be expected but it had to go into the donation pile, just looked super awkward on me."
2.0,The color was way  off. It’s a light yellow & the picture showing bright yellow. I ordered a large & it was too small. Never again
2.0,"Runs EXTREMELY small. I ordered a large and I am size 4, and it was more like a xxs on me....!"
2.0,"It's pretty, but heavy."
2.0,"Unfortunately I had to return this item. I love the style, but It did not fit as expected, and the fabric has a horrible chemical-like smell!"
2.0,"The 'wood' lining inside broke out as soon as I took it off when I tried it on. Not a bad ring, runes are clear, metals light, but it's not actually a size seven - the wood band inside made it a seven and without it it fits like an eight so I can't wear it on the finger I wanted too."
2.0,"I was willing to pay more than I normally would for this t-shirt, because it's Star Trek, however, when it arrived it literally stunk. I'm relieved to say that the stink washed out, but the material does NOT feel like cotton and nowhere on the labeling does it list the fabric type."
2.0,Have not been able to install
2.0,PRETTY BUT WAY TOO SMALL!
2.0,"Fabric nice, however item ran extremely smaller than stated."
2.0,"Wanted to like them but the fabric wrinkles like crazy,  they are super thin and oddly baby at the bottom.  And the POCKETS WERE SEWN ON BACKWARDS. So the look ridiculous when wearing.  Missed the return date so I'm stuck with them.<br />Donating"
2.0,VERY THIN. basically a long sleeve T shirt
2.0,"I got one pair that was one size, and one pair that was plus size, cause most the reviews claim that even the one size fits their size 14 body. Well not even the plus size fit me. I'm a size 16, so I fit in the ranges. Otherwise very soft material."
2.0,"seriously I set it to hot, it's more like warm, not hot at all!"
2.0,"The earring is cute and looks like the picture. However, the makers must have thought people have very thick earlobes. There's a space between my earlobe and where the back of the cat attaches to the post. The  space is noticeable. Also, the back of the cat is very loose and moves around."
2.0,Was happy with the overall earrings. Accurate sizing. I’m a 0g. And all were great except one par which arrived chipped. Kinda bummed cause that was one pair I was looking forward too
2.0,"This dress is made with T-shirt material, looks very cheap, I returned."
2.0,"I bought this in sizes Medium, XL and XXL and each one fit the same lengthwise. They all just became increasingly wider. They did not look like the photo. They did not gather and look floor length and elegant. I am 5’7” and between 135-140lbs and around a size 6/8. One of those sizes would have probably created the look shown if the product was the look shown...but I don’t believe it quite is. Read the reviews. Perhaps more petite figures can create this look and pull it off! Good luck!"
2.0,"Pretty, but too bad I can’t wear them because they are impossible to close when you put them on. They are even very hard to close when they are not in your ear. So disappointed."
2.0,Beautiful shirt but runs really small
2.0,they are really big
2.0,1 size to small and didnt have the support needed
2.0,"I only had the thing for around 3 weeks before the battery ran out. I expected the battery to not last as long as it probably should, since I checked the watch very often, but it should have lasted more than 3 weeks. I went and had the battery changed, but the watch has never worked the same since. I'll press on it, and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the watch will just randomly come on when I am not ever close to it. I VERY MUCH DO NOT RECOMMEND IT."
2.0,Not worth $60.. Pockets are fake. Feels more like a jacket or a very light weight coat.
2.0,Did not receive all the bracelets in the picture. The sunflower was missing.
2.0,The second time my wife wore it the rivets on one side popped off.  Very disappointed!
2.0,Large was way too small and I usually wear a medium.
2.0,"Material is thin, rayon-like. Looks great, but not warm at all. And the zipper pull is left-handed, and feels very cheap. Great if you're going to a convention, not so great if you're trying not to freeze."
2.0,Band tends to run large.  I have a small wrist and the band was to lose and to big.
2.0,Did not like the waist placement in this dress
2.0,Not at all what I expected gave it to my friends daughter
2.0,item runs very small. returning
2.0,"The fit runs very small. I ordered 2 sizes larger than what I normally purchase, just because I thought it might run a little smaller. Well, It ran a lot smaller than actually size says. Material is very thin. Quality not really great. I ordered a 4x and it would actually fix a size 12-14 perfectly. The style is cute, just not accurate sizing."
2.0,The shoes fit really good but the souls were out lickety split like a week or so and like I had no souls at all
2.0,Didn't look nice on me and fit was a little tight.
2.0,Nice skirt.  Usually wear a small/medium. Ordered medium.  Has right fit but WAY short.
2.0,Cute but Cheap thin material. Too small.
2.0,They were much larger than the picture indicated.
2.0,I bought these for my Mother who I would say is a small medium. Ordered a large as recommended and it was way too small. If you are a full figured woman I definitely would not recommend!
2.0,"Used it exactly once before the zipper ripped and it became almost useless. It functioned as what I needed for a very short period of time, but luckily that was all the time I needed. Don't buy this expecting extended use."
2.0,Ordered to put charms on it . It won’t open
2.0,"5'1, and 110 lbs. The small fits me huge and the length goes farther than my butt. It's also see-through. You can check out the photo I added, that's with my white camisole on. I'll probably end up giving it away because I'm too lazy to return it."
2.0,"Too shiny, looks strange in photos"
2.0,For 10$ you can't really expect quality. Was an incredibly beautiful ring but after 3 days on intermittent wear one of the stones has fallen out.
2.0,Pretty but very thin and recipient felt it was unforgiving in back around bra area! Emphasizes any imperfections
2.0,"This dress was supposed to be pink, it's orange. The fit is horrible and material is cheap. I'm sending it back."
2.0,too big did not like wanted something smaller and more dainty
2.0,Stretchy thin soft fabric with very long tunic length with narrow sleeves and quite warm
2.0,Cute but hurts my head after 4 hours of wear.
2.0,"The hat was received in a box, which was good, it wasn't smashed.  However, as I tipped the hat over to put the chin strap inside the hat, the band fell off the hat.  I purchased for an upcoming vacation but won't be bringing it.  It was too big on my head so my husband is going to wear it when doing his yardwork.  You get what you pay for!"
2.0,"Cute design, but not what is pictured. The Summer ready logo is the same, however the length of the shirt is the length of a regular fitting shirt, not a long flowy one as pictured. It also had a ruffle like side. Don't know what's up with it, but def not what I ordered"
2.0,"When you pay as much as you are for a product. You do not want to have it arrive all balled up in a mess! You could have at least put a cardboard holder to keep the necklace in place or a piece of cotton! Luckily I was able to get the mess undone! This is my daughters Christmas present, I was really unhappy with the way it was delivered. We’ll see how it works 😊"
2.0,"I love the strength of the steel and the hearts on the end of the bracelet, but the most important part, the words, are almost unreadable because the engraving is so tiny.<br />There is plenty of room to make it larger and legible, but it isn't and I am very disappointed.<br />I bought this to replace one I was given as a gift that broke and the detail was SO much better and what I was looking for in this one, but sadly I did not find it."
2.0,This is great if you’re looking for a robe 🥴.....it’s a wrap dress and the picture is so cute but unfortunately the actual turn out of the dress isn’t like the picture at all. It has no shape and reminds me of a bridal robe that you wear when you’re getting ready for your wedding day. The material was pretty and thick but that’s the only nice thing about this “dress”.
2.0,Really like the extra sleeve on the outside of the wallet.<br /><br />Update:<br />Less than 1 year and the wallet is falling apart. The inner lining was not stitched properly and its just opening up
2.0,"I got the Small, and I wear a 34B bra, am 5'6&#34;, and have a 27&#34; inch waist. It fits, but it looks longer on me than on the model, to be honest. In addition, it's not as &#34;swingy&#34; and loose-fitting at the bottom as the photo looks. It's form-fitting, though doesn't really cling to the fat. This material, however, looks somewhat cheap, like a dress shirt from K-mart or something, and wrinkles very easily. It is quite see through and I would suggest nude underwear + nude bra with a white tank top, or with black tights. Again, what did I expect right? (I guess I expected something like Forever 21, which is cheap and sometimes does pull off the temporary &#34;quality&#34; look.) Also, what made me dislike this even more was how wrinkly it is. You have to be very careful."
2.0,Couldn't get arms halfway up.
2.0,poorly made. Fell apart after only a few wears.
2.0,"Super thin material, more like underwear than workout shorts. Waistband is wide, but there’s no actual elastic in them, it’s just the fabric doubled over. I wouldn’t buy these again, they’re just overpriced boxer briefs."
2.0,Really pretty and I got it quick. Wore it one day and it's already turning my finger green. Super disappointed ☹️
2.0,"Product is misrepresented.  The material is shiny (obviously not 100% cotton) - almost like nylon.  Looks like it might be water proof, but it is not.  I sprayed it with water and it was imediately absorbed.  The lining is plaid, but does not match the picture - no logo. The zipper is on the wrong side (like USA woman's zipper).  Obviously a knockoff, but I guess that was expected.  Not terrible looking (for $18)."
2.0,My poor nephew has body image issues....this didn't freaking help!! Looked like he was about to hulk out 🙄
2.0,Too small even  ax large
2.0,"This dress is adorable! I bought the yellow dress & it's vibrant! The material reminds me of a doily & it is a bit see through. Seamless nude undergarments will definitely have to be worn. The arm length fits nicely & comes just below my elbow like the picture shows. The dress length is above the knee. I'm 5'7, 125 pounds, & a 34C. I ordered a small & I'm swimming in it. I think if you have a petite frame than order a size down. Overall I think the dress is true to the photos."
2.0,"I liked the look of these earrings, but they broke within two weeks..."
2.0,"Though these socks are very soft, they are thin and didn't provide any additional warmth than a common sock does. I've used Carhartt and Dickies in the past for thermal protection and they worked. Don't waste your time or money on these."
2.0,It's too small. I can't even close it around my neck.
2.0,Not as pictured completely different color and material came apart after 2 washes
2.0,The length of the shirt is too long
2.0,"Need to return. I usually wear a M, ordered a large as advised in description and as where I fall in the size chart. Too baggie for a compression shirt. A bit of a swooping neck as well."
2.0,"Wanted to love them, but way too big- looked like a smock and I sized down. Might work for taller ladies, but I’m only 5’4 and was incredibly unflattering"
2.0,"very disappointed with the fit, I can't possibly wear it.  It is so cute too.  The sizing is way, way off."
2.0,Looks better in the picture.  not really pleased with this item
2.0,"The material was thin, so I ended up returning it. However, it was a cute outfit with a good fit. I just wish the material was a bit thicker."
2.0,Clasp fell off when taking out of bag.
2.0,"Not happy with this bracelet. Way big for my wrist, gave to a friend."
2.0,They were nice looking and I was excited to get them.  But when I put them on they had a slight magnification effect that actually made the road blurry.  I returned them.
2.0,Causes too much sweat!
2.0,Not wide enough to cover breasts .. I'm 36D and the large wouldn't cover
2.0,"I LOVE the earrings.  HOWEVER, before I even wore them once, the stones FELL OUT.  Luckily, I saw it, so I didn' lose the stones, and I glued them in.  I hope the other ones like this aren't the same way."
2.0,Every pair from the same pack is a different size.  The hanes logo is put on crooked and all word.  One of them has two different leg lengths. Absolute mess.
2.0,"Super uncomfortable, rides up and literally cut me at the top of my bum. I can’t even wear this."
2.0,"While they stayed on, they did have a tendency to shift around. Clearly not intended for a slightly larger figure"
2.0,The little sister pants are the exact same as the big sister. Little sister onesie is one size smaller then the big sister (2t) little sister onesie is suppose to be 0-6months and she probably won’t wear Hers till she’s a year.
2.0,"Cute pattern but the fit is horrible. I’m usually a M, size 28 jeans and ordered the L just to be safe and they were still too tight."
2.0,Got it yesterday it looks so cheap and it looked like the leaves were sliver there black on the l very disappointed.
2.0,"I tried this on and thought is was super cute. I ordered a large and it fit like a glove. The struggles came when I attempted to take it off. It took so much patience and energy to get out of this suit without breaking or tearing anything. I could not bring myself to keep it, no matter how good it looked. I ended up returning it due to the hassle it would be to take this on and off."
2.0,This bag would have been perfect 30 years ago when our children were small. But at this point everyone carries their our stuff in their backpack beach chairs . Will look into same item if it is made smaller.
2.0,Was never able to get it to warm.
2.0,The magnet clasp doesn’t hold. I almost lost it once and lost it for good—I don’t know when.
2.0,"This band is really cute, but it's extremely hard to put on, even though I'm using both of my hands to put it on my daughter! The little button just doesn't go into the holes easily, and she winds up having to wear it very loose just so we can get the dang button to close. Skip this one."
2.0,"Green fingers in a day, brown rings in a week."
2.0,"I really like the style of this dress. I think if the workmanship is good and if they have a good quality control this could be a very beautiful dress. I am returning for a refund and will not try to buy another one because I don't feel confident that I will get a good dress.<br /><br />First of all, it's not sheer. I bought an XL even though I am a US Medium because I wanted the length to hit my knees. I am 5'2"", 160-ish lbs. The style and the concept is good, but the execution is very poor.<br /><br />The buttons took me about 10 minutes to put through the holes. The holes are so tiny! Maybe so they don't come loose while you're wearing the dress, but still TOO tight! The top button is not align properly, so the left neckline will not lay flat and not straight. the lines of the V neck is UNEVEN. It's a shame because it is such a cute dress.<br /><br />Also the neckline is a little to deep for comfort.<br /><br />19 dollars is not cheap for the quality of this dress. a 19 dollar dress at walmart is guaranteed decent stitches and good quality control."
2.0,They were more for a 4 year old than a 1-2 year old
2.0,runs VERY small...returned with no problem.
2.0,not great after washing
2.0,These look great but the screws come out easily and the joints didn't seem very durable for the age of users.
2.0,Pants run very small and do not come in sizes large enough to fit.
2.0,It's a nice jacket but my boyfriend is 5/8 and 190 pounds and it was too small for him so I kept it for myself
2.0,The seems were coming undone
2.0,"The size does not reflect the amount of material that is related to the size..Wow!! I love the style, design  and the type of feel of the material..it drapes over my short statue of a frame...like window drapes"
2.0,"Smaller than expected , it was 3 weeks late getting here."
2.0,"Nice bracelet, but the clasp turned a different color with in a day"
2.0,This is beautiful but giant!!  This is not what i expected!!
2.0,"You get what you pay for. I use the handle not the straps on the larger bag. The seams of the liner, and the seam that holds the handle to the bag (despite carrying light weight) tore apart after a few weeks."
2.0,The color looks like very fake
2.0,These run big don’t follow other reviewers advice to order a size up...or they will be too big.
2.0,They are cute but definitely do not fit right. I was a size 26 in jeans before pregnant and purchased these shorts in a large I can BARLEY get them on and once they are on they are prett uncomfortable
2.0,Not enough push up for the smaller girls
2.0,These Are Nice Slippers! But They Started To Tear Apart After 3 - 4 Months! I Don't Wear My Slippers OutSide Except To Retrieve The Mail📪!
2.0,The neck hole in of the T’s (solid colors) is too small and will not go over my son’s 6y.o. head. They look like they would fit and the material is nice and light for summer.  The T’s with graphics fit great though. A bummer and not worth the price for 2 flawed items in the package.
2.0,"We've only had them 2 months and they are broken. This is our third pair,  the first 2 were great. These just fell apart."
2.0,"These are soooooooooo small that it is VERY difficult to get on and very difficult to open. The two smallest pairs are basically useless, but if you don’t mind struggling and wrestling to get these on, you’ll be happy."
2.0,very small on the fit and short
2.0,Too small! Clearly not adults sized as advertised! Hard to keep inflated . Adorable for few minutes it was inflated properly!
2.0,These goggles fit fine and for the first 5 or 6 times I wore them everything was great. Now they fog up right away and are worse that wearing nothing. does anyone sell goggles that will last a whole season. Don`t  buy these if you are expecting the anti fog feature to work. I tried talking to the sellers and got no response.
2.0,I you've seen some of LIGE's watches this one falls miserable short. It's very cheap looking and not at all like I expected. Check out some other watches by LIGE this one is a pass.
2.0,"Looks nice , fits good"
2.0,"Received the wrong item, with a crucifix-style pendant instead of the goth/punk design on the listing.<br /><br />Unlike the current first product photo (but matching the other 2 current photos), the rope is a brown rawhide-looking leather, rather than black. The rawhide is better suited to a ren-fest style outfit, rather than completing the rocker outfit I was designing for Halloween. The strand has an adjustable portion that lets you lengthen or shorten the strand, but it's not the most intuitive to adjust.<br /><br />Two stars since the crufix design is okay."
2.0,It didn’t fit right and i didn’t like the feal of the material.  Too smal too tight around the waist.
2.0,No chain and too little
2.0,Im disappointed. Not what I was expecting to received. I bought the silver tapers thinking I'm getting the exact same length as my gold tapers.... Wrong! I feel slightly cheated...
2.0,"Bottoms fit a little snug, but im sometimes in between small and medium. The top was way too small."
2.0,I bout this as a Christmas gift for someone and the watch looked GREAT however the back peace fell off as soon as the packaging opened Smh it's nothing crazy glue can't fix but it was still disappointing and a little embarrassing
2.0,do not buy if you are busty- it won't work for you trust me :)
2.0,Not even close to what the pic looked like!  Returning
2.0,the print is nice but way to small and short in arm length i gave to my nephew to avoid hassle and weight of refund and returned shipping.
2.0,"Let's be straight, you're not buying this bra for support and lift, you're buying it for the cool straps. And it's a good thing too because it doesn't give a wink of support, which I can't be too mad at since that's not what this bra is for. Unfortunately, the straps are also less quality than I hoped. They seem like they're made out cheap bikini material, maybe like something you'd get in a halloween costume. It looks alright, I guess, but if you're wearing a decent top the cheapness of the bralette fabric really stands out in my opinion. I won't send it back, but I don't think I'll be wearing it nearly as much as I hoped."
2.0,The item was way too big and didn’t appear to be as cute as picture. I’m returning today!
2.0,"Runs extremely small.  I even an ordered a size larger than I normally wear, still too small.  Submitted a request to return it and received no response."
2.0,Necklace broke on the first time wearing it.  Not worth the purchase!
2.0,Do not use the measurements provided by the size chart. This poorly made skirt runs very small for the printed size.
2.0,"Poor quality, was very disappointed."
2.0,Not durable in another way. The gray thing is spearating from the  frame after a couple of weeks.
2.0,I exchanged it but it was still gross and I just got sick of exchanging. I was so frustrated. I had it in a day and the gems faded... they are so cheap they turned like black and it looked like they were missing in literally a few days....it’s like why do this? The rose gold was nice but the gems made it gross. It’s also extremely tiny. I don’t wear it.
2.0,The size is way off. I'm a XL but I ordered a XXL and it's still too tight
2.0,No as I expected it
2.0,"The shirt is very thin, almost see-thru.<br />It also lacks the graceful back as pictured in the ad.<br />Instead it's stand out quality is the way it clings to unsightly rolls like static electricity.<br /><br />You could get a better bargain at the dollar store."
2.0,"This bikini is VERY small, so order a size up. I'm 5'7, 150lbs and I bought a large which fit ok.. although I was worried aboug my boobs coming out :( The top of the bikini came untied, so each cup is separate which means you can customize how you tie it. Same with the bottoms, and it was very confusing to put on !! I spent like 20 mins on my vacation trying to figure it out, and didn't even bother to try putting on the bottoms, i was so frustrated.  The bikini looks as pictured. You'll need a lot of patience putting it all together"
2.0,When I got purse I absolutely loved it. However in just a month the straps tore from purse. It was not heavy enough that you would think this would happen. It’s a nice style and spacious. Just be careful as it seems to only manage very minimal in weight.
2.0,too large and bulky. Not cropped at all.
2.0,"Most comfy dress in world! Love the material. But the flower pattern wasn’t like picture and it is so off that it completely ruined the dress. It’s still hanging in my closet, I should have returned it, I’ve never worn it."
2.0,The fabric is very thin- you can see undergarments through it. I got black and I STILL have to wear a camisole underneath because it’s too sheer to go without. Not worth the price.<br /><br />The cut is flattering and it fits as expected.
2.0,"This dress is pretty and the top is very flattering.  However, I cannot leave a good review because the fabric on the lower 2/3 of the dress both looks and feels very cheap.  It is shiny, flimsy, and does not feel like it would breathe well in the summer.  I am very sorry to be sending this back, because if the entire dress was made in the same material as the top, it would have been absolutely perfect."
2.0,hard plastic and the display is really hard to light up.
2.0,"The shirt was delivered as promised, but a lot smaller than expected"
2.0,Bad quality.  Do not dry shirt or iron it ...
2.0,"Material was weird. Not really cotton, not really rayon. Not really  polyester"
2.0,The shoes seem find but with the correct sizing I cannot get them on my 4 year old unless I buy a size too big.
2.0,Uncomfortable around the underarms. Not the easiest to nurse in.
2.0,"In the wash instructions, they advise not to dry in dryer. . baby socks. I did it anyway and sure enough, they are falling apart. But they are thick and long to the knees."
2.0,"The straps are too tight...and the sole is uncomfortable.  Feels like my foot doesn't go far enough into the shoe to sit comfortably/correctly, so I've never been able to wear them. They do not look good on.. more like something an eldely person would wear & feels like I am walking on a hump.  Really wierd sandals. Wouldn't purchase again. I wish I would have sent them back during the return window... but I got busy and totally forgot."
2.0,I didn’t like the color is not bright red it’s a burgundy color
2.0,I liked the bracelet. I did feel less discomfort in my back while wearing it but the band has already broke and a piece of it sticks out. The other strand will probably break because one isn’t strong enough to keep it together.
2.0,The quality of this shirt was not what I expected from Lauren Ralph Lauren. Very thin and not great at all.
2.0,The sizing of French Toast Boys Cargo Shorts was not in line with the French Toast Adjustable Boys Double Knee Pants. As a result I returned the shorts and purchased a larger size.
2.0,it broke within one week
2.0,"Overall these are okay BUT because they are triangle shaped where the jewel is - it penetrates into the skin, making your piercing gauge larger. Acting as like a taper. It’s not uncomfortable at first at all, but not good if you’re trying to keep your hole small. Also very noticeable once you take piercing out or change it. Took a few days for my hole to heal back to normal after wearing these."
2.0,Runs super small. No stretch
2.0,Ripped after 1 wear.
2.0,Not very comfortable or flattering to face. Lightweight and light sun blocking. Feel like they will fall apart with moderate use.
2.0,"I read all the reviews, which seemed great.  It was very inexpensive, and it definitely felt that way.  I ordered two and both had the inside labels cut out.  So I wasn’t sure if they were previously owned."
2.0,The length isn’t very long. It’s actually very short. I have small legs
2.0,Nice beads but no sandalwood scent.
2.0,It’s cute and fit but it’s cheap. I’ve put these pajamas in my baby 3 times and the last time the zipper broke.
2.0,"This dress is exactly what you pay for. I received it and the material was thin and cheap. It looked like I was wearing a rag. Not a fan, I returned it immediately. Not worth it."
2.0,I would love this more if the clip that locks the wallet closed didn’t break making it pretty much useless. The rest of the parts are pretty sturdy though.
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this bracelet. The first day I wore it, it started unraveling!!! I love it, and i wish if company could replace it with another one of the same i would appreciated."
2.0,looks frumpy on as far as I'm concerned but maybe it's not my style.  It's kind of cheap but then again I didn't pay much for it.
2.0,Too small and returned.
2.0,"Normally, I love this brand.  This dress was thin material, and didn’t lay correctly.  Looked very frumpy! Unfortunately I got it before leaving on a travel nurse job, so I couldn’t return it and it went to the donation pile.  Might be cute on someone super thin with no curves, but looked awful on me!"
2.0,"these are extremely small for small child, i would say this would be perfect for a toddler?"
2.0,They do smell pretty gross! They're ok for playing around the house
2.0,"I became aware of Russell Athletics from a purchase at Walmart. It was a very Heavy Sweat Shirt.<br />I saw these on Amazon, and assumed it would be similar.  Nope; not even close.<br />The Quality is not the same as the ones I purchased at Walmart a few years ago.<br />I will keep the two I ordered on Amazon, but will go back to buying at Walmart where I can see what I am getting."
2.0,The print is cute and the fit is good.  The problem is the material.  It's polyester at best and doesn't breath or hang well.
2.0,"The back of this shirt will barely cover your belt.  The pic makes it look like it is long in the back.  Was hoping to wear with leggings and boots.  Definitely can't do that.  Unless I wear a shirt under it, my back will show.  It is also wide:/"
2.0,"The linen was thicker than what I wanted and although the quality and fit were okay, they made me look rather frumpy when I tried them on.....I was expecting a thin linen pant and linen was defintely thick so I returned them."
2.0,"These are pretty and my daughter loved them, although was disappointed that it looked like 1 purple and 2 white crystals, instead of 3 different colors as shown in the picture."
2.0,Impression is too large.
2.0,Dislike: ran small<br />Like:quality was nice
2.0,The best thing about this was that it was comfortable.<br />It wasn't easy to install. Well it's just that the pins are separate so you really have to be careful and delicate with it. Not good for my small chubby fingers.<br />Also the fit wasn't right for my galazy active 2. I filed down close to 2 mm so it would go in.<br />I wouldn't have minded the 30 mins it took me to file it down with a nail file but what makes it unwearable for me was that the minuscule chain pattern on the metal had one or a few open chains at the edge of the watch that would get caught on my clothes and sofa or anything soft like that.<br />I lost a pin taking it of because as I mentioned they are separate and have a bit of a spring. Later I found it but I doubt that I will ever use it again
2.0,Not for kids. Way to big so stop calling them &#34;boys heat retainer socks&#34; and relabel as mens socks.
2.0,in the line it states pack of 5. 1 ea... so I believed that I was getting a pack of 5 and only received 1.. a bit deceiving
2.0,Material is the equivalent of wearing a plastic bag. Style is cute. Fabric does not breath at all. Too short. Elastic waist is irritating.
2.0,"Construction of dress is weak and super short, I am 5'8&#34;."
2.0,"Makes your ears stick out and I literally have the tiniest ears in the world. Poorly made in reference the thought of the product, the part that goes over the ear should’ve been thought out better to avoid making people’s ears poke out . Other than that fabric is fine, good for sun protection."
2.0,Was a nice shirt and I liked the material but runs small
2.0,"Very pretty ,but the clasp is inefficient. One is loose the other does not clasp shut at all."
2.0,Did not appear as it looks in picture<br />Very boxy and big like a square
2.0,"Chips easily, threads on the earrings already worn out after one week."
2.0,"Too small, I'll be returning them."
2.0,Two weeks later the ring is already getting tarnished. Wish I could get my money back.
2.0,I was disappointed seeing this dress when it arrived.  It was not as pictured.  The background is very beige- and almost looks discolored.  It looked so pretty against the stark white background in the picture online.
2.0,I chose the colour green. The dress I received did not look as vibrant as in the picture and it was too big for me. I chose size small. I am about 125lbs and 5'3. It is a midi dress so it hits below knees just where I wanted it. I was even worried that I should've taken the medium instead just in case the dress was too small. Woop!...nope. The top part of the dress is big despite the elastic band and will need adjusting and that's going to cost something. Oh well we'll see.<br /><br />Side note: the dress had an awful smell to it (like dirty laundry?)maybe it was returned. If I wasn't too far away rn I would simply return this item.
2.0,It turned brass and turned my daughter wrist green.  Not stainless steel.
2.0,"I have a few pairs of underwear in this style that are great. Super revealing and yet totally covered and comfortable. The key to the pairs I like is that they are cut high enough to rest on the hip. This pair is wider which I like, and the pouch is stretchy enough but the cut is too low. I'm a lean guy so my hip bone is pretty prominent and this thing still slips off if I'm not careful. It almost looks like they took a regular pair of low rise bikini briefs and cut one side off. It works as sexy fun time underwear that you don't need to wear for long but that is about it."
2.0,"the ring really looks like the fourth picture, they don't fit right, and they could do better.. i polished them a bit to make them fit and they look better.  I love the idea, but they need to put more effort into their product."
2.0,Cute but strap broke after only a few wears and my daughter was very upset cause she loved this outfit.
2.0,"I purchased this bracelet along with two others from amazon the same day. all similar in style and metal composition-per the description. I was very excited when I received this bracelet. I have smaller wrists and often bangles are too big. This was dainty in design, light weight and comfortable to wear.<br /><br />To date, I have worn this bracelet about a dozen times. I have always worn it with the 2 other bracelets, purchased the same day. This is the reason for the low rating. The other two bracelets still appear to have a gold finish, this turned silver in various large spots. Mostly notable at the bottom of the wrist and sides. While the worn locations make sense (the skin rubs in these areas most) the timeline acceptability does not. The other two bracelets still look great, no blotchy silver marks.<br /><br />I understand that you get what you pay for and this is an inexpensive piece of jewelry. However, wearing it only a dozen times (at most) to the office is hardly extensive and understandable wear and tear. It was never worn in a shower, pool or exposed to harsh chemicals. The life of this bracelet is disappointing to say the least. I expected it to last longer."
2.0,"cute but cheaply made, seams sown top and bottom of dress not sown together all around, buy one size up. Gave dress away."
2.0,"Broke thr first time I wore it, knots at the end need to be reinforced."
2.0,Band very flexible
2.0,"I got these bras for after my baby. I was hoping they would make breastfeeding easier. These bras offer no support for large breast. My breast pads don't stay in place, and my milk leaks onto my shirt. The only thing good about this bra is that I can get my breast out quickly to feed my newborn. If I could return this product I would."
2.0,"should have paid attention to the fact that these were also reading glasses....<br />got 1.75...wanted 00.  They are nice looking glasses, though"
2.0,The panty fits but the leg opening is uncomfortably and unusually small for this size panties.  Also the tag is very big and does not easily tear off I am returning
2.0,"Really poor quality. The designs are rubbing off after just a few washes, and the strings from everywhere it's sewn are shredding."
2.0,"Honestly was expecting better quality for $40. The fabric is really thin and the top has little to no support. The straps are sooo thin. You'd have to wear a bra with this dress. The belt is the exact same fabric as the rest of the dress unlike the photos, which i was really disappointed with. :( The sizing was right, that's about the only good part. I really liked the style of this dress, I wish the fabric would've been nicer so I could've worn it to my friend's wedding :(("
2.0,To big like one zise up i get the M but it fit my sister she is L
2.0,Would be cute if the fabric didn't turn white when stretched a bit - had to return because of this issue.
2.0,"I love the fit. The color is not as advertised (khaki). The color (a light yellow) would have been ok, but i was not a fan of this fabric and i noticed what looked like dirt on the strap. I'll be returning the dress. Too bad it didn't work. It was an attractive style. Also, it's a bit short with heels.  I really wanted to make it work. It fits so cute!"
2.0,"Too boxy and neck is too stiff, it's not my style but may fit others better,  it fit but not like the picture."
2.0,"When I opened the package there was a black mark on one area of the collar.  I figured it would wash out.  But the reason I returned the collar was due to a strong chemical smell that would not wash out.  The collar was pretty, and looked well made, but I couldn't wear it with the strong smell and would have been embarrassed if people standing close to me would have been able to smell it also.  I don't know if all of the collars would have the same chemical smell, but I returned it and did not ask for a replacement."
2.0,This item is cute but it falls on my face and the nose clip is small and not strong. Nobody can hear me through it and I work in customer service  it keeps falling off my nose which is the whole point of a mask.  I would never buy one again. It’s too late to return it.
2.0,"I have small wrists but this bracelet is tiny, I feel like my circulation is being cut off. The crystals are a lot smaller than they look and don't shine very much. I've purchased many cheap items from Amazon with success but this one was disappointing."
2.0,Wasn't as good as described in the listing. Disappointed with it
2.0,Small front rise in the breifs.  Had to get a higher waist bottom to feel comfortable.  Underwire caame out on second wearing.
2.0,Cheep. Not best quality and spandexy feel to it. Looks like uneven squares were cut to make product. Not the best. Not at all what I expected.
2.0,"Looks cheap, poor quality.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,"Beautiful dress, terrible quality. We purchased this dress for our daughter for a special tea party she is hosting. The first came in and the zipper was completely broken. We sent it back and got a replacement. The replacement came today and there is a massive cut in the center of the yellow fabric in front and the bottom of the dress is sewn into that cut. It’s a massive obviously flaw made during the sewing process and there is no way such a mistake was somehow overlooked. This subpar quality product was sold to us anyway. Tomorrow is the tea party and it’s now too late to order a replacement (not that I would order this dress again anyway)."
2.0,While I loved the look putting this on was a challenge to say the least. Lets just say its a good thing I do Yoga...I had to get into a crouching position and lean on a wall to be able to get into this. I'll have to cut the back and put in snaps for this to work moving forward. Getting out of this was similarly challenging and worse as it was wet!
2.0,They stretched out so bad my kids can't wear them
2.0,I got two of these skirts and they both fit super odd. They are definitely longer than knee length unless you pull the skirt up to your boobs. There was way too much excess material and it just looked ridiculous. I may try a size smaller but I think that would be too tight and still excess material. Just not a fan of how these fit.
2.0,Super duper soft! Ultra lightweight. Love it!
2.0,The hair would stop working when u squeezed the air.
2.0,"So the dress fit fine, but the color pink was much more of a bubblegum pink rather than the color in the picture. I returned it and bought the navy instead"
2.0,Thin material could barely get my foot in the leg hold it was that small. Bought a medium got what looks like a small or xs.
2.0,"Wanted to love these boots, unfortunately they are not true to size and are very stiff. Hit right above the shin and it is uncomfortable. The look is great. Maybe with A Lot more wear they with loosen up some. Seem to be well made, Just need to be better material used to make it not so stiff."
2.0,The Dress is pretty and true to it's picture. But the size is way to small. It is not one size fit all. It is one size fits a size two.
2.0,Cheap metals but pretty stones. Chain was very flawed and it broke after taking it out of the box.  Wouldnt buy again.
2.0,Fabric takes some getting used to..it is a bit clingy not cotton material. It's a US company but made in China. XL is not XL.. don't care what anyone says types or takes pictures of. All of my XL tank tops are bigger than this XL tank top therfore this XL tank top requires an XXL to be in the XL family.
2.0,this outfit is very stiff my son refuses to wear it even after washing it is too stiff and too large
2.0,Did not last
2.0,"Super soft comfy fabric but also very see through. I would have to wear an undershirt with this and that kind of defeats the purpose to do anything active in this. It also runs small and tight - I am between a M and a L, and I got L, and it fits close to the body snugly"
2.0,"One of the goggles had a missing band,  so unable to return the whole pack.  Disappointed.  Fog up easily.  Nose piece is uncomfortable."
2.0,I returned this as it looked like 2 different greens and I didn’t like the material.
2.0,"The straps on the dress were stretched out, and will not stay up at all. My grand daughter was very annoyed having to pull them up non stop, and took the dress off herself after about half an hour. She was so done with it."
2.0,"Did not like this dress at all, it's cute in the pictures but once I put it on it looked hagged and soggy."
2.0,I ordered a 3X. The dress that came was definitely not that as my 14yr old daughter who’s barely 100pds was able to fit it. Frustrating because I needed it for a funeral but wasn’t worth the hassle of a return.
2.0,The material does not feel like fleece. It feels like felt and its a little harsh on your skin. I had to return it.
2.0,"It is big in some places, small in others. The fabric is very cheap and stiff but painted to look soft.  By the photo it looked like the perfect shirt but it is just bizarre in person.  It also had some areas that were stretched as though they had been pulled on.  Sending it back."
2.0,"I normally wear a L or XL. The XL of this set did not fit. The pants for below my belly button and the bra hardly contained my boobs (I’m a 36 D).<br /><br />If you want side boob and your belly button showing, get these.<br /><br />Aside from that, there a nice material and true to the color"
2.0,Bought the Pisces bracelet for my 17 year old daughter and she loved it. It was very pretty and dainty looking but it broke after a month. The Pisces symbol split right in the middle and was beyond repair. Unable to return because it happened right after the return window closed which is a very small window. If it didn’t break I would have given this more stars because it really did look pretty when she was able to wear.
2.0,"It's nice and my girlfriend liked it but it broke very easy and couldn't fix it, I personally wouldn't recommend it to anyone else to buy."
2.0,"I thought the bracelet was the cutest thing when I got it I was so happy with it and couldn't wait to give it to my granddaughter. Between yesterday & today 2 of the charms fell off at separate times. Thankfully, we found them and put them back on. I'm so disappointed with my purchase. Not holding much hope for the life of these charms since two of them have fallen off already and she's only had the bracelet a week."
2.0,Purchased Rose Gold bracelet. The color was more copper than Rose. The copper color is very noticeable when I try to pair it with other rose gold bracelets.
2.0,"Tight across my hips and baggy in my waist and chest. Had to return. Could have possibly tried to make it work, but didn't love it enough to try. Also the leg length was super long. I'm 5'7 and they were extremely long even standing on my tippy toes."
2.0,"i was encouraged by the glowing reviews but these shaping panties just did not do it for me. they smoothed things out a little, but that's all -- didn't suck my belly in as much as i'd hoped. i guess i need a firmer control."
2.0,Cheap material broke the first time I wore it
2.0,"I wanted to love this so much. I ordered a medium because that’s my size but it was too small for my boobs. Otherwise, it fit perfectly. Had to return."
2.0,It was longer than expected and didn't fit right. Hung on me. Definitely runs larger than I expected.
2.0,Everything is okay except large fits like medium.
2.0,these slide off continuously. They're pretty but not functional.
2.0,The dress was very pretty but the sizing was off.  I thought I was buying a large and it was actually a 2xl.
2.0,"Poor quality, string is totally different than hat and does not match at all."
2.0,Narrow tube no flare from waist to hem like seen in pic.<br />Tube shape not flattering on a curvy shape
2.0,I didn't realize when I bought it but Only half of the world on it.  OOPS LOL
2.0,The lettering wore off after 3 days at the pool.
2.0,These earrings lol super cute in the picture but they are a lot bigger than pictured.  The climbing leaves actually extend past my earlobe.  The women modeling these must have huge ears.
2.0,When I ordered this scarf I thought it was gonna be yellow it is a mustard color and it didnt come with the kobwa key ring  very disappointed in the color of the scarf
2.0,Missing the back to one. And we got a cheap slave bracelet in place of the ear wrap with hair comb.
2.0,Smaller and thinner than expected..
2.0,These hurt going in and coming out. They don't stay in place well and they are hard to bend to make them stay in place better. The only thing stopping me from giving a one star review is how cute they look. I do not recommend this product for anyone that actually wants to try them on.
2.0,"I’m 5’3”, weigh 170 lbs. I ordered XXL in two different colors. This one was very tight. Other one fits good. I sure wish they could get their sizing right."
2.0,"It is as pictured, but the hat is way too big. There's no way to make it smaller. It fell to my shoulders when I put it on."
2.0,Child’s<br />Endangered.
2.0,"I ordered these because I like nightgowns with sleeves and liked the cotton.  However, the fit is wrong, too tight in the sleeves, material is very rough- uncomfortable, and construction was terrible, ended up putting them in the donation box."
2.0,For some reason the ridge in the front of the flop digs in to our son's toe.
2.0,Pretty but over sized. A 9 is like a 11-12
2.0,Fit was good but I couldn't get past the old-lady material. Was very odd! Returned.
2.0,"Product does not stay on and sticks to everything, but your boobs. No support for the 1 minute it does stick."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:d6d8f2daafad1df7eaf68085e4863ff4]] I thought this band was perfect, but it slowly but surely began to fall apart. One day, one of the bead just broke in half and fell off. No clue how, just randomly happened. NOW, the string is starting to unravel and I can’t wear it safely because it won’t tighten. I wouldn’t recommend handmade bands like this because they can easily fall apart. Pretty annoyed."
2.0,"They keep tearing from the same spot, right side right by the stitching in the front. After a couple times of wearing them you'll notice a little hole and it keep getting bigger."
2.0,No idea how to close them unless I tie it
2.0,feet to the side too big to the top not proportion  when they made it
2.0,"Bought a 120 USD for this bag and this is what I see after the first DAY of using it I only inserted the surface book 2 into that bag.<br />Poor quality assurance. *very disappointed*.<br /><br />otherwise, good bag, a little smaller than expected but all in all good bag."
2.0,Shipping was quick and on time. The shirt does not fit right. The chest fits ok. The arms are tight and the body of the shirt is huge. It looks like a moo moo with a tight band across the top.
2.0,It’s a little lose and very thin. You should spend your money on more quality leggings...
2.0,"I would have really like it if I had gotten the right size. I usually wear a large or xlarge. I ordered an xlarge, but should have gotten a xxxlarge for it to fit.<br /><br />Mainly too tight in my shoulders, armpits and bust."
2.0,It truly is a silica gel band. It looks okay from a distance but does not look or feel quite like i expected.
2.0,"I was sooo bummed when I received this. It arrived broken. 😭 you can tell due to the dip in the back. I couldn’t even get it on my head because of how much it dented inward.<br /><br />Otherwise, it’s an absolutely beautiful hat. I’ve had my eye on it years ago, and finally found one here. Mine didn’t come with a feather either. I returned it and am still awaiting my refund from the company.<br /><br />Charlie 1 Horse has always been great quality, so you may want to take your chance and purchase it. I even told them if they had one that wasn’t broken, I’d be up for buying again. It also shipped quite quickly."
2.0,"The chain is nice but As soon as I took it out the packaging, it started to turn."
2.0,Wanted mid-rise got full-rise. Sent back.
2.0,The chain broke a few days into wearing it. The sound the chain makes as it glides through the hook on the pendant conjures up &#34;cheaply made&#34; imagery.
2.0,"The jeans are cute, however the color is not at all what it looked like online. I ordered the vintage and they look a little dirty to me. Also, they’re too small. The style is cute."
2.0,This is a very avarage quality and the background literally looks like paper! and worst is that the crown is jammed and was no way to even adjust the watch! Will be returning immediately. was not able to even use!!!
2.0,"I hate to give these socks only 2 stars because they are well made and the price is right. I originally ordered one pair on 15 Jan '19. They came by post direct from china and they didn't have the SB SOX logo on the cuff. They fit me just fine so later I ordered 3 more pairs. They came by UPS or FEDEX (can't remember which) and had the SB SOX logo on their cuffs. These socks were way too tight, especially the cuffs. The socks in both orders were supposed to be L/XL and lite compression. Since there was no consistency between the orders, I can't recommend them."
2.0,Not easy to get full coverage with the white paint.
2.0,"The set did not include the eyebrows, mustache or beard."
2.0,The sizing seemed wrong or ran on the very small size as my wife is a size 2 and a medium was snug on her ...
2.0,"Returning because I thought it was short sleeve, &#34;long short sleeve&#34; is a confusing description. Buttons aren't standard dress shirt buttons, but rather metal snap buttons that look weird and feel awkward. Fabric is heavy and canvas-like and the sleeves are very baggy, and yet too tight on the wrists to wear a watch."
2.0,the zipper is not right on it wont unzip with out brakeing it
2.0,Some of the beads were missing from the black pair.
2.0,Great shiny gold. They ran extremely small. I was unable to wear them.
2.0,Stones are very dull.
2.0,Looses it shape terrible!!
2.0,"I bought this set specifically for the green pair and they deliver. They are beautiful! The rest are no goes for me. In my 1st photo is the pinky/purple pair. You'll notice the earring on the right has a lot of white. Well- that's actually completely clear. One earring has beautiful full rich color, the other is half clear and looks terrible. 2nd photo is of the ""leopard"" design. It looks pretty terrible too. Not enough leopard and the colors are dull and flat. 3rd photo is blue/rose mix. I actually have no complaint on this pair The white you see is actually white, not clear. These have nice color quality but they are not ones I would wear as a matter of personal color preference. 4th photo does the green no justice. They are gorgeous."
2.0,"Poor quality (thread unravelled), very THIN (rough) sorta (sweats) material and the string for the hood fell apart. Very disappointed!"
2.0,"These sunglasses are way over priced! They feel plasticy and cheap. The temples feel like they are aluminum and could easily bend out of  shape. The case is awkward, its a barrell design that doesn't fit very well in my handbag. And the sunglasses didn't come with a lens cloth or pouch. These sunglasses are more like $100 and definitely not worth $300."
2.0,"the threading is way too thick to go through my earring hole. never had a problem with any other threader earrings. i really wanted to like these, they look cute but just don't fit. they are super light too"
2.0,"If you like your school colors, don’t buy! This is a dark purple blue representing UK instead of the normal royal blue. The color is totally off, and it’s one of those pleated masks...which I highly dislike and it’s not what is shown in the picture. Not worth buying."
2.0,I love Everything  I had order from Amazon
2.0,i bought this in xl and it didnt fit. I usually take a medium. very tight..
2.0,Way too small. I ordered a large. They were supposed to fit a 12-14. They fit my mom who wears a size 8.
2.0,"Ordered “new” came in a plastic ziploc bag. Smells like someone wore them, ran a few miles, wiped their armpits with them and then shove them in a plastic bag and shipped out."
2.0,it arrived to me broken!
2.0,"this is not a $30 hat, it's worth about $10."
2.0,"Loved them until washed, it is now 2 inches shorter and waist is at bust line now. It is  not wearable now."
2.0,"It’s a gold striped pattern. I didn’t really pick up on that in the picture or the description, so I wanted to make sure to say that up front. The pattern makes the style look a lot more vintage, if that’s your thing. It’s quite thin, so a nude colored under layer is required if you don’t want things to show through."
2.0,I tried to adjust it to my size but one link too small or one link too big… no in between and looks really bulky… not a fan
2.0,The back and the front are exactly the same. You can't tell which is which by the way it's made.
2.0,I was expecting the earrings to be blue but they have a greenish tinge to them.  Probably will try to return them.  Never worn.  Don't match my wardrobe.
2.0,I never wears them it’s too small
2.0,"Didn’t really shape anything, absolutely no way to use it as shapewear - there’s no opening or clasp on the bottom, so in order to use the bathroom, be prepared to have to take your whole outfit off first..."
2.0,"The fabric is stiff and plasticy. It looks so adorable in the picture and just bland and flat on me. The color doesn't seem as vibrant. After reading a lot of recs and the sizing chart I figured I would be a large, but it was a little too big on me. The fabric and cut just doesn't seem exchanging for a medium to be worth it though."
2.0,The quality is ok it gets very bent out of shape and digs into your wrist leaving red marks since it's a cuff. Love the prayer. I purchased two and can never wheat due to irritating my skin were cuff is closed as far as it can go
2.0,Not the right style for my body. Not for someone with a belly problem. Very unflattering silhouette.
2.0,The neck is too long.
2.0,Too small & the cut isn’t the best
2.0,No battery so I will return it
2.0,Not happy with the item. Backing does not keep the angel on the pin.
2.0,"Honestly, I am not sure if I got the wrong pair of earrings, or if they're both supposed to be facing the same way on purpose. It wasn't quite what I'd imagined. The pair I received are both very nice looking on my left ear, because they lay with the curvature of the left side. However, on the right side, they are curved contraflow to my ear. The design is lovely, the price is fair, but it looks as though I am wearing mis-matched earrings."
2.0,I was so excited to get these. I ordered according to their size chart. These shorts run extremely small I couldnt even get them up over my thighs. Sad because I was already looking at different patterns to order next.
2.0,The slit is bigger than expected
2.0,Runs small and the one I received looked very cheap.
2.0,Not enough lift....
2.0,Socks are very tight and do not come past the knee cap and I'm only 5'4&quot; . Not what I was expecting. But shipping was fast.
2.0,This is the 2nd time I have purchased and both my normal size and the size up was too small. Hopefully 2 sizes up fits!
2.0,Just too long for me. I'm 5'2&#34;
2.0,"Supposed to be X large. Fits like medium-large,"
2.0,The big horizontal stripes are not flattering for plus size person:  way too big
2.0,The sack is nearly impossible to use out of the bag. Yiu have to pull a drawstring until two grommets come out. Mine never did and I waited to long to test it out and can no longer return this. My own fault but design isnt user friendly.
2.0,This is probably great for women who are more narrow. I have thicker thighs and smaller waist so the seams were strangling my legs.
2.0,"Could just be my skin, but the tape, or slip guard makes me break out in welts!  I’m not allergic to latex either."
2.0,Pretty see through but fit well for home workouts
2.0,"The material is a nice quality, but the size is too small."
2.0,"So this could have been an ok cover-up...but the shoulders looked like there were my mom's 1985 nightgown/robe (See photos). The material was sewn together so that it was not visually aligned properly with the pattern (see photos of print on one side and not on the opposite side), and it felt tight in the shoulder too. Returned."
2.0,Great product aside from the pocket coming unstitched by the 3rd time wearing. I now have a hole under my pocket -.-
2.0,"Bought the first one, the strap broke so we returned and got a new one. Now the second one's strap broke... too late to return... My kid loved the watch while it lasted."
2.0,"I bought them for my daughter and they are cute, although they comapart easily. The plastic vent doesn't stay or go back on when it does come off."
2.0,"After wearing them  few time, I cannot fit the small post into the larger post as if something is jammed inside. I am no longer able to wear them."
2.0,"Adorable shoes, but only one lights up."
2.0,Hard to get cards out
2.0,"They are so tiny, smallest earings I've ever got but it would cost more to send thrm back then to keep them. Cute but bite size."
2.0,This fits great but the material is odd...it is thin a slippery kind of like a custom...has a wired shine to it also
2.0,Awkward fit. No support.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:94bd3de5b811f44099537b9e91a0accc]] Dress sleeves are falling apart from stitching and dress is big would like to replace for size 6 ! Wedding is august 29 ! Please help contact me
2.0,"This is a costume.  It’s a nice costume for the money, but not any where near theatrical grade.  I bought it for a base to a costume so it’s fine, but without significant improvements I wouldn’t wear this as it came.  It almost feels like it’s made from fabric lining."
2.0,"The blue color is lovely, flattering. The print has a very specific aesthetic. Make sure to zoom in to see what the print looks like. I ordered an XL. I normally wear a size 12. I have a small waist with hips and a booty. The XL fit like a size 10 in the hip region. Too tight to wear. Its worth notin gthat the material is very thin, too thin to wear in a professional context.<br /><br />Please allow me to return this item!!"
2.0,"I think the battery is exhausted, don't work the clock"
2.0,"These shoes run a bit small and are very cheaply made, but they were cheap - so what should I have expected?! Not worth returning, but would not purchase again."
2.0,"Stone was loose, felt cheap - returned."
2.0,way too small.  I don't even think this would fit my 12 year old niece.
2.0,Not true to size. Disappointed!
2.0,"Im 5'7&#34; and chunky and bought the large white one. I LOVED how his dress hung over my hips, elongated my lower half, looked perfect with my wedges and hid my pooch. The sleeves were breezy, light, and awesome and easily covered my upper arms. The fabric is a thin, light cotton that would've wrinkled easily but it definitely could've kept me covered and cool simultaneously. Some people might feel a little more comfortable with a slip on a sunny day. Definitely hand wash only. The side slits went up to just above my knee. The waist elastic was wide and it slid over my shoulders easily, but, unfortunately, I struggled to get the waistband over my chest. I unfortunately had to return this dress because the top was just a little too tight which made my chest look enormous because the bottom was so flowey and flattering. I thought the top part was more of a wrap, or at least had a little extra material up there, but it's just a flat center chest seam, which has never been a flattering look for me. Aaarrggh!! So close!!"
2.0,The liner only covered 2in from rim.
2.0,I returned this X-large item because I like to use these shirts over my kayaking clothes when I'm on the rivers.  As a &#34;second layer&#34; it was too small.  I decided to order the XX-large.  I usually wear an extra large because I like a loose fit.
2.0,This is a beautiful skirt but it was to my ankles! I ordered size large and it was too long! Had to return!
2.0,"Can’t complain too much because I paid such a low price, and maybe I did not break them in for long enough. But wow, were these shoes painful. First, they came with a few scuffs already on them. No big deal I guess… I wore them while traveling to save space in my luggage, and was nearly in tears when I got to the Airbnb after a day of flying. I had to wear bandaids on my ankles for the rest of my 3 week trip, and was too scared to put these back on again.<br /><br />(PS: if you’re going for these as a dupe of a certain black combat boot, they do not look close enough to be considered a dupe. The rubber soles on these are much darker and dissimilar to the other boot in question.)"
2.0,The arch support on these is very poor. I returned them. The tongue flap was sliding around on my child while he was trying them on. The cording that is supposed to support the foot wasn't adjustable and very loose/cheap.
2.0,"I ordered this item in size large; but, it fits like a size small."
2.0,I had to return these socks because I could not get them on.
2.0,"I would have likes this; but the butt is baggy as it has little spandex and the crotch, 'shall we say' strays easily from home. . I will only wear it in our pool; otherwise when wet I felt like I had on an adult diaper. I bought a large-I wear a 12 or 14; bust was ok."
2.0,"Just recently purchased these Winna brand gloves. They seem well made although the first time I charged them one glove showed a battery status less than full even though they had charged overnight. A couple days later when I turned them on, the display on one glove simply turned off when it wasn't supposed to. So already I am questioning the reliability of the batteries or the electronics or something. They are definitely not worth the money I paid for them...will be returning to Amazon."
2.0,These tops are ABSOLUTELY 1-2 sizes larger than expected!!
2.0,the description should be microscopic...I have to get a magnifying glass to look at it. it is smaller than a dime
2.0,I’m so disappointed. I wear an xl and this shirt fits like a medium.
2.0,"Size for me was ok. 5’3 155 large. But the color it’s not right as showed. I don’t see they have the color that I got, so maybe wasn’t wrong, just the color of the pic it’s wrong. If u like but more red, this not what u want. Overall I guess it’s fine for fits. But definitely don’t like the color of it."
2.0,"This dress looks so cute online and I may have kept it if it wasn't so thin.  From the front it looks good, but turn around and look from behind and you can see the outline of your bra and panties."
2.0,"Weird sizing and dimensions. Tight in the waist and loose in the bust (and that's saying something, as I'm not lacking in the bust department). Cute print, soft fabric. I wish it could have worked, because it looked so adorable."
2.0,"Besides the price & color, I would not recommend. I made a fast movement & my watch went flying. Doesnt really close on your wrist & opens up slightly when you bend it. If you still decide to buy this make sure not to do too much movement & have a case on your watch."
2.0,These are very small. I normally wear a medium and bought an XL per size chart. They feel smaller than a medium.
2.0,Not tight enough for my baby’s feet. These aren’t tight fitting so my baby has no stability. She just takes them right off.
2.0,"Cute little onsie, however, the color is really pink not red."
2.0,"I should have read the reviews before buying this pendant. I have purchased items from Westcoast Jewelery before and I am very satisfied with the seller. I just think that this is a pendant for a guy, not for a woman, kind of large, which is why I am returning it, not to mention that it's two pieces that don't stay together, which is also stated in some of the other reviews."
2.0,They started to separate  - rubber sole from leather after wearing only three times.  Returned.  Disappointed.
2.0,The product has some glass/plastic (I don't know) over the words and it was cloudy and hard to read. However it fit and if I bought another it would probably be better.
2.0,I can't get the creases out of it! I tried steaming it really well and everything.
2.0,These are not the pants pictured or even the same color. They aren’t really high waist. The waist band is much thinner then the photo. Not what I was expecting at all. Just meh all around but the size is right that’s about it...
2.0,"So cute and was a big hit with the kids BUT there were SEVERAL that did not work! Fortunately I had just enough that did work for the number of kids I had. It could have gotten ugly, lol."
2.0,Dress fit prefectly. The problem is that it wasn’t sewn properly and there is a white stripe down the back. It looks like the material was at the end and they didn’t bother to trim it.  I bought this dress to wear for Easter
2.0,I ordered this in COFFEE and the company sent BLACK. The knitting is nice but the opening for the head is small and I don't have a big head. Also I didn't realize this wasn't made in America. So returning it will be more than it's cost.
2.0,"Although the boots fit all right they tended to wrinkle around the ankle and I returned them. I've ordered the Paige, which I have in the Cognac color."
2.0,The material is ok. The thickness is too revealing for me. The checkers are kind of makes me think the stamped checkers will peel off as i wash them.
2.0,"Strange fit, extremely high waist, very unflattering....think materntity, wide, wide legs....think 70's.  One star for design, one star for nice material.<br /><br /> I am 5'6&#34; and the waist came up under my bra and I usually like a high rise.  I tried folding it over and that was a no go.  The hips and length were fine.  If you are about 6' tall, these might work if you like a wildly wide leg."
2.0,"Sizing was a little on the small side, it just barely fit. The shoes were so cute, looks exactly like photo. Just not built to last or for real wear. The heel broke off in a day. The little pearl is just a clip similar to a Manila envelope metal fold tab closure, so we lost it twice. Once a stranger picked it up and handed it to us, the second time lost for good. If you are buying for a costume and don’t mind a single use type item, it looks great. But they didn’t last more than a day for us."
2.0,Only got one EyeSnug and one set of ear plugs.  Ear plugs you can get 200 for $17.  Was supposed to get a travel bag and got a zip lock sandwich bag.<br /><br />Wrote and got a refund on the whole purchase.  The EyeSnug works well and is comfortable.  Customer satisfaction factor excellent but I would have rather have had what I ordered.
2.0,The fabric is not the best. Definitely not flattering as a maternity dress.
2.0,Just thought they were regular cordless headphones. But he has Autism so they work.
2.0,"I can see stripes in the lenses where they are ""polarized"" and it affects my vision.  Very disappointed with quality."
2.0,Dress was large and not a flattering material. Plus it was very thin and you could see through it.
2.0,"They were all different sizes. Had to give to granddaughter, they were small"
2.0,Very difficult to set up...not woth the price
2.0,First time I wore it two of the snaps came out<br />Can’t wear at all now till repairs
2.0,It’s not a regular mans medium. I’ve never had a medium shirt fit soooo small.
2.0,"Disappointed, hard to read and a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be."
2.0,No support whatsoever...
2.0,I ordered a small and it’s too bulky and long. One person wrote that she wears hers backwards... how she figured how to make that work out... I’ll never know😂 You could buy a better dress from Walmart for $20.
2.0,The plastic that tightens the shoes broke after the first wear. Then the lace popped the next day.
2.0,Disappointed in “chain” it’s more like a fabric rope. You get what you pay for😕
2.0,"I've ordered 4 of these shirts from Merino Tech. The other three were fantastic; this one not so much. The shirt is marked xxl, but fits like a medium, right out of the package. I could barely get it on. It fit like an Under Armor compression shirt.  Of course, my job sent me out of town for 45 days so I missed the return window. Now I'm stuck with a useless $50 tshirt.<br />While I've ordered this shirt in different colors, there seems to be inconsistency with the weight of the material as well. I ordered it in gold first, then I went back to that order in my Amazon order history and ordered the following 3, one at a time, in different colors.  Two of the tshirts are lightweight, almost see through, but the third is much, much heavier. I'm not sure what's going on with MerinoTech. After those first two shirts, I raved about how fantastic their products were. I didn't mind the different cloth weight in the tshirts I already have, but it's obvious that there are some quality control issues here; Two different weights of material, the sewing in another one of the shirts is constantly shedding threads, and now I get a shirt that isn't even close to. I really want to give a better review because those first two shirts were completely fantastic but spending $50 for a shirt that doesn't fit and realizing it's a quality control issue balances against the 5 star review I would have given after my first purchase and brings Merinotech to a 3, based on the sum of my experience with their products."
2.0,I do not wear this shirt.  The dropped shoulder seam is very uncomfortable and restricts me when I reach upwards.
2.0,Cant wear it. Way to small bought 2xl because I like extra room and it fits like maybe a large. Too tight across shoulder arwa
2.0,"Nice design, beautiful watch. BUT, the buckle broken within 1 month. The band is too thick for the thin buckle to handle."
2.0,These dresses arrived almost 1 week late. They are slightly smaller then expected if you want to bend over with out showing your business I would size up. They are a comfortable material and I would say the color is true color. I was very disappointed that they arrived so late I ordered them for the holiday weekend and for a trip and received them after. Don't know that I would do business with this seller again they are not dependable.
2.0,They are very see through. After washing them they shrunk so small they are now belly shirts and to top it off they also are now twice as wide after washing even with cold water
2.0,Runs super small I got a medium adult Nd honestly it looks like a child small. Those Asian gals are tiny I suppose.
2.0,earrings are too tiny
2.0,"Look of watch is fine,band too small gave to my wife"
2.0,"The lining is way too short and sewn into the seams, no amount of pulling down helps. Disappointed.  Had to order a slip, hopefully that helps.  The lining is about 2 inches shorter than the sheer part."
2.0,"Very disappointed in this top...  I can't even explain the way it fits, but there's something about the way the underarms are sewn.  It's like they are sewn into the sides of the top and it makes it where I can hardly lift my arms.  Such a bummer, because the top is so cute!!!  I can't return because I threw all of the packaging away :/"
2.0,"Ok, so I expected these to be small. I have small earlobes and normal sized earrings just don't work for me. That being said, these are wayyy too small even for me. They look like they are for babies.<br /><br />These also don't really look like the picture. The pic in the listing makes it seem like the pineapple part is a cutout/lattice design, with the ""crown"" part being solid. These are completely solid. And while they are listed as 925 sterling silver, there is no stamp on them to prove that and I seriously doubt that they are.<br /><br />All things considered, they're ok for infants, maybe small children, but definitely not for adults and not at all worth the price. Would not purchase again."
2.0,I ordered a 2XL- waaaay too small- fit like a large. I ordered five shirts at the same time from various companies and this was the only one that did not fit.
2.0,the umbrella  wouldn't close after being used two times.
2.0,"The ""white"" color is more ""off white"" which I was hoping but is actually a yellowy off white."
2.0,"I got two jackets just in case, a US L, and a US XL, Now the US L is a tight fit and while it does look great it isn't very thick, and I wouldn't have room to wear more clothing underneath it. The XL one is hideous, it's faded, completely bad print on the jacket, because one size difference of the same product it should not affect the product quality itself, I expected a larger better fitting NICE looking jacket when ordering two to be on the safe side. Now I am returning both and am very dissatisfied. Do not expect your coat to look like the picture, they took a well printed one to use as a cover. You may end up with an ugly printed faded one like I did. In the photo inserted, the left one is the very faded one while the right one looks more like the photo. The lighting does not do it justice of how white/purple faded it looks."
2.0,"I was super excited about these and they're relatively cute on but they have a few issues. One is that they're a little big, so order down. The second is that even with that in mind (I'm between a S and an M and got a S), the fabric bunches weird at the crotch and gives you lines on either side. Additionally, the fabric is a little itchy. Lastly, they are COMPLETELY sheer when bending over. I am returning and would not recommend."
2.0,Shoulder seam blasted apart the first time I washed it. They were comfortable the one night I got to wear them though.
2.0,"I’m a small so I purchased a medium and it was to tight. Also, it looked like something a hospital worker would wear.  Gave it away cause I didn’t<br />want the hassle returning it."
2.0,The fabric is incredibly thin and wrinkles easily. The chest is a bit small and the pockets are in a bit of an awkward place making someone with hips look even more wide. After only two washes the fabrics is already starting to shred along the seams with many little threads coming out.
2.0,"The two stars are because it was pretty, and the settings were aligned very nicely. You wouldn't know it was fake...but, a stone fell out the third time I wore it. That was a deal-breaker."
2.0,"I used this on a 15 hour, round trip bus ride. On the way home the outside zipper broke."
2.0,Not vert durable.  They break easily
2.0,"good enough but i got what i paid for. The white ball at the top looks like craft clay that they randomly and haphazardly rolled in the &#34;crystals&#34;.  Up close, VERY CHEAP looking but fine for if you're not getting too close to people. I will keep and wear as I wasn't wanting to spend much and the tension is good where they will stay on."
2.0,Beautiful shoes. I wear 71/2 but bought 1 size up and it was still small. My feet could not get in.
2.0,Nice chain but cheap I may have worn it 4 times the most before it tarnished.
2.0,The product I received is NOT the same as the picture. I was looking for a wrist let with the ID on the OUTSIDE. The wristlet that I received has the ID slot on the inside and the interior is structured completely different from what is in the picture.
2.0,Not flattering for busty women
2.0,"I solely bought these shoes so my kid can get his tootsies wet while he played outside. For instance: in the garden, running through sprinklers, walking to the beach...so on.<br />I really wanted to like them but the Velcro keeps un velcro ing. They are cute but we can’t use them :0("
2.0,"The sleeve was tiny, only fitting to my forearm,  I'm only 5'8"
2.0,This dress was too small and completely see through. Very disappointed.
2.0,PRETTY TOP BUT THE RUFFLES KEPT TURNING TO THE BACK SIDE OF THE MATERIAL. HAD TO RETURN.
2.0,"I wanted to love this jacket but it's just too cheaply made. It's just not warm enough and I could literally feel the wind passing through the fabric. Disappointed that a lot of the pockets are fake and the ones that are functional are cheaply lined with what feels like dryer sheet material. Pass on this one if you need it for function versus looks, not worth the price."
2.0,Way bigger than size expected. And is a silky fabric.
2.0,"If your shoe size is larger than 7.5, do not buy these. They are VERY small!"
2.0,"They are cute, for sure, but my daughter won’t wear the top because the appliqué Hs a crinkly middle layer and is stiff. The fleece is cozy, but appears cheap and likely to become matted."
2.0,Made small.  Order a size up. Also very thin material and came with a cheap plastic belt instead of the pictured ribbon. One small hole at bottom of zipper which we can fix but disappointed with having to fix new item.
2.0,I bought an XL (same as always) and ended up giving these to my daughter that usually wears a medium in leggings. I couldn't even get them on.
2.0,Totally adorable pants but I bought an XL and it is more like an adult small.
2.0,"One of them would always cut into the back of my ear on one side. I'm not sure why, would not recommend."
2.0,This is a great idea. However they didn't work for my daughter. She is 6 and has a big head. They are definitely comfy but when she got in the water she said they leaked. A lot. So much that she wants to go back to the other kind even though she hates getting them on. I'd return them but I already tossed the packaging.
2.0,"I measured a 38, so I purchased the XL.  The side buckles/hooks are sharp and irritating.  The lace falls under the bust.  After a few hours the elastic band was tight and uncomfortable.  The shoulder straps were very comfortable, no digging into my shoulders.  Someone, somewhere needs to come up with hook corners that are not sharp.  Would I purchase this bra again?  Probably not."
2.0,The band is very thick and does come loose after a while.  The clasps are plastic and difficult to get attached to the watch.  Very uncomfortable compared to the stretch watchband you can get from Google.
2.0,"This watches not comfortable; the edges are quite sharp on the wrist band.  Also, in spite of providing a tool to size the band, the pins could not be removed to resize the band to fit.  Disappointing, given the price of the watch."
2.0,"I'm giving 2 stars because I love the band but it wasn't as advertised. Description said 22mm, but I received a 38mm-42mm (indicated on the box). The pins were too long for my Samsung Gear S3. I'm requesting a refund and will be returning the band."
2.0,"Style wise, it was just as pictured, however, after just 3 days the stone fell out. I had bought this as a Christmas present, so as you can imagine, I was dissapointed. Maker should do some research on how to make the product durable for normal everyday use, especially for a guy."
2.0,"Had to return this. The back has too much lace fabric, it isnt as open in the back as the picture looks and it doesnt lay flat on your back. It looks like you have 2 lace wings sticking out your back, but not in a good way. The front was beautiful though. I just couldnt get over the weirdness of the back of it."
2.0,"I like the ones with the beads that screw on although they are too small for a tragus piercing but I do like the ones with the beads that screw on for my upper cartilage earrings. It's important to pay attention when you get them because only half of them have the captive ball on them. The rest are very thin gauge with regular slide on backs that don't stay on very well. The ones with the screw on bead in the back though, aren't bad. They just or advertised as tragus rings and they are definitely too small for that. But I found other uses for them."
2.0,For the price you get what you pay. Not toddler sizes. Good for one use maybe.
2.0,"I didn’t receive the exact dress pictured. It’s close, but you can absolutely tell that the pattern isn’t quite the same. I’m disappointed."
2.0,The size seemed right by they just kept falling off constantly. Cute if they stay on your kiddo.
2.0,very scratchy and fabric has not give to it
2.0,"It was comfortable and worked well for about 3 days. Now the spike just falls out of the stud. I'm pretty upset with the fact that after three days, the stud is already too worn out to hold the spike in."
2.0,This does not like the picture. The blues are totally different. I’m sending this back quickly. It fits horrible..... the legs are the worst. Can’t do anything with this jumpsuit but get laughed at.
2.0,Too small. Requires a very small head. First time purchasing a hat that was tight. Requested return. Seller obliged.
2.0,"This umbrella was very small, very short handle & flipped inside out very easily.  Really was not useful at all."
2.0,Thin polyester material that doesn't look like much but it doesn't breathe at all so the little one gets hot in it. Sizing was a little on the small side.
2.0,"I liked the fit, but the fabric was cheap, and looked cheap. The camo was not what it looked like in the picture.  Returned."
2.0,"This dress runs large, but the pockets are right at the hip."
2.0,Not impressed with the buckle part of this belt. I own another ratchet belt and the quality of the buckle is much better than this one. The part that releases the belt is very loose and wiggles like it’s going to come off. I would not buy another of these belts.
2.0,"I love the brand, always great quality. However, I couldn't push my foot into the shoe part. The material was really nice."
2.0,I would say you could find this at your local Walmart.
2.0,"This strap, while it works, lost all the pattern from the strap. It no longer looks that great."
2.0,Got 2 rings instead of 3.  One broke after a few days.
2.0,"Does not fit a iPhone XS Max well plus a small men’s wallet.  Great to travel with if you need something to just carry your small wallet in. Also, is a flimsy material.  Not too sturdy."
2.0,"Cute bracelet, but cheaply made. Broke the second time I wore it."
2.0,I like the material it’s made out of but the sizes run small
2.0,I did not keep this ring. It was not what I Was looking for. I was a little concerned about the size
2.0,Very cute but run at least two sizes too small.
2.0,Mine came broken but I am sure they would have looked great :(
2.0,It is pictured looking like it has grey as well but is too small. I went by the size chart and obviously that needs to be updated.
2.0,Dress doesn’t look like picture.  Fabric is cheap and seams do not match - looks like something I botched on my sewing machine and I stink at sewing.  Don’t buy.
2.0,"I thought this was a slide that goes over the entire length of the lower leg. It only covers the foot. Way to expensive for that. I am also disappointed in the seller, the communication was slow and they would not read my inquiries thoroughly. One time I asked if they could make sure the shipment goes out sooner than later in order to meet a deadline and they responded saying “ok, we tried to cancel the order but it’s too late to cancel”. I never asked them to cancel it! I asked them to ship it sooner."
2.0,I wanted to love this swimsuit the color was so pretty. My breast are not full and it flattened my breast even more. I have a hard time finding one piece swimsuits that do not squish my thighs/hips and this suit squished me but if I went up a size it woulda been too big up top. I’m still on the search to find a swimsuit that is high cut and some support for breast but for small waist.
2.0,I'm a 5'9 US 16/18. I ordered XL and it was too small. Material is thin/stretchy. I would have to order 2 sizes up to feel comfortable.
2.0,The price reflects the quality. I should have known better.
2.0,"I like the product, it is really nice and practical, but I am really disgusted with Amazon, as I ordered 2 of these organizers, and they where delivered in different dates but worst of all they were diferent sizes and brands. Actually one of them was much smaller and generic brand, but it was paid at full price. I can't return the product as I received it just a day before I was leaving.<br /><br />Talking about the product it is a good product, at least the original. It holds everything into place."
2.0,"It was only a little bigger than a dime. Hard to open. Really, really had to look to see Jank and Sally on it."
2.0,Dress really was adorable but not at all able to be worn it was way too see through. Print was just like pictured but you could literally see every outline of my body! Too bad.  Had to send back
2.0,The bra has raised area for nipples. Which to me make no sense. A padded bra is to avoid drawing extra attention to that area. Who designed these? Not a women with any sense of modesty. I just wanted a bra with thick straps and full coverage. It make me look like i’m Not wearing a bra. Very dissatisfied
2.0,Underwire too long on sides.
2.0,"DID NOT LIKE,  THERE ARE TO BIG."
2.0,"These fell apart within 20 minutes of unpackaging. What a waste of money! Definitely do not look like the picture, they are cheap and tacky looking."
2.0,"These gloves are very cute but uncomfortable to wear. The fabric is a very stiff and rough material, strong wind tends to go through it. I wish the thumb was fully covered but the button of the mitten cover is very sturdy. They are a nice addition to a wintery outfit but I would definitely say that these are more for fashion than warmth."
2.0,"I am returning item today as it was not what I was expecting.  Be aware that this pendant is MUCH smaller than it appears in photos.  The chain length is fine, however, unless you are purchasing for a small child, I wouldn't recommend as the actual arrow is not even 1/2 inch long.  This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my 20 year old, so it just won't work.  However, if you are purchasing for a child, it is a pretty necklace and shipping was fast."
2.0,Ordered for a surprise party. I had to reoder all because sizes where very tight this suit had no stretch.
2.0,"I got an XL considering a lot of sports bras are a little tighter for compression. Unfortunately, the bra fit more like a M/L and was very tight. If you like the style I would definitely size up. I will be giving mine to someone who is a tad smaller than myself."
2.0,too big and way to big of a bill
2.0,"I like the jacket, it's what I was looking for. However, I ordered a medium and what arrived at my door was a small. The small fits me (5'4, 135lbs, large chest) but doesn't leave me any room for something like a sweater.<br />Bought it for a trip in two days, not much I can do about it now."
2.0,"I wanted a face covering without strings that go behind your ears, that's why I bought them.  Unfortunately my glasses still fog up and makes seeing difficult.  I wore it for the first time to the store and by the time I got out of the store the covering had stretched and I was struggling to keep it up on my nose.  Nope, wouldn't recommend these to anybody, don't waste your money."
2.0,They were not purple they were burgundy. I don’t like burgundy.
2.0,Does not at all have the quality Lands End is known for. Very poor thin material. I cannot trust Lands End again. It’s ok for around the house and Covid runs to get gas or food. Ordinary
2.0,Not exactly what I expected. Loved the fabric but did not fit as expected. Very tight in the arms and chest area so I would definitely size up
2.0,"I knew I wouldn't like these wings when I bought them, but I didn't want to try to make my own for my daughter's Halloween costume. I searched high and low, and without buying the entire Abby Cadabby costume, you can't buy just the wings EXCEPT for these stupid little cardboard ones (I made my daughter's Abby Cadabby costume, so obviously I didn't want to buy the crap quality premade one for just the wings). They fit about as well as you can expect cardboard fairy wings to fit a toddler. There's not a lot of whimsy or flutterability. But they're the right color and pattern at least. I wonder why there aren't any traditional material Abby Cadabby wings on the market."
2.0,Size more like 10-12
2.0,"Nothing like the picture, fitted stuff polyester material"
2.0,"I bought these to make a cute flute glass charm for my bridesmaids. Unfortunately, when I went to make them the bag did not contain any S's or V's which of course are the letters that three of my girls names start with. They are good quality but really a bummer. If it's for something truly important I wouldn't purchase."
2.0,Way too big... Beautiful ... But huge
2.0,Not neat looking...too wrinkly ... even after I ironed it it looks wrinkled. 😢
2.0,I love the style of the shirt but the size was much smaller than the labeled size I bought a 4X and the shirt fits more like a 2X
2.0,"Since the last time I bought this particular hat, it's size, color, shape, and material have changed. I was not sent the hat pictured in the listing."
2.0,I loved the artwork but apparently the quality of the hardware is subpar. The zipper has already busted and I had very little in it. It was very disappointing to spend so much and have this happen. I have 4 Anuschka purses but this is my first wallet. I have always recommended the purses to others but I will not recommend the wallets.
2.0,To big big big crapola
2.0,"Runs very large for the size! I ordered a Large, I'm 155 lbs, 5'6, 36D breast & I looked like i was a balloon in it! Luckily the return process was very easy."
2.0,"Necklace came broken. Shirt was very unflattering, like a great grandmother's shirt, but what did I expect for 10 bucks..lol"
2.0,"It is too small, like it was made for a petite The color and material are pretty."
2.0,"Cheap feeling but okay. A little big on my head and i have a big head, almost looks like glasses made for those with cataracts."
2.0,"Poor made, 2 lenses were out of the glasses when arrived"
2.0,"I'm not sure this did anything long term. Seemed to work after one use, but then stains showed up in the same area on the shoes after one wear. Don't think I would buy again."
2.0,Ordered 14/16 but it was more like a 10/12
2.0,"This is a high quality, well made harness. However, it’s very small. You’d have to be no bigger than a size 8 to wear this. However, I’m determined to make it work. So, I’m taking it to my local shop to have one of the ladies make a larger front strap. Otherwise, it’s a great harness."
2.0,"Beautiful, discolored my finger. May have nickel as I am allergic or not be hypoallergenic. Usually don’t have a reaction to 925 silver."
2.0,Sizing off and style wasn't liked by the &#34;Boss&#34;.  I returned it.
2.0,I felt it separated and I had to keep adjusting the two panels. Probably would fit better on b cups.
2.0,"The strap doesn't fit AT ALL as pictured. The ear slots are much lower and my ears barely fit, and the strap is also MUCH tighter than necessary to keep my jaw closed. No, I don't have a large or mis-shapen head! It's uncomfortable, and getting returned."
2.0,I would suggest checking the measurements twice before purchasing this item. It’s really nice but if your size is too small to wear then it’s just a waste of time to buy this.
2.0,"Love the black fabric that this is made from but the colored portion on the sleeves and pocket have already begun to pill after less than 1 month of wear. I washed in front load machine in cold water and dry on delicate low heat. Super bummed because this is such a cute shirt otherwise.<br />If you could hand wash, it might be worth it...I'm just not able to commit to hand washing any clothing as a mom of 2! Lol!"
2.0,"When I bought them they were listed as water proof, they are not.  They are booties and a bigger loop in the back  is needed to get your finger in to get them on, otherwise you have to undo most of the laces.  Good points, they are warm. good grip on wet surfaces, ok for walking.  I did a 3 mile hike wearing these and would not do it again would wear my normal hiking shoes.  They are what they are, do not think you are getting some waterproof hiking shoes when you buy these, they are really fur lined sneakers."
2.0,It was kind of poorly made. Peeling upon arrival. Didn’t use the correct scissors (cut wasn’t clean.).
2.0,"Not a huge fan. Ordered because they were vegan touch screen gloves, but they're too long for my fingers, and so don't really work as touch screen gloves, because my fingertips don't go to the end."
2.0,I didn’t like how this fell on my body. Was unflattering. Don’t buy if you have a belly.<br />Material was cheap to me.
2.0,"This watch was made for a wrist twice the diameter of mine, and there's no easy way to change the size. Buying a watch without a leather strap was my mistake, but it's silly that they would sell it as if were an armband."
2.0,Seems like a knock off Fox shirt
2.0,Super cute. Fits as expected. However I ordered black and it is navy blue.
2.0,"The zipper broke after a couple of month and is irreparable. Flimsy, cheap quality. Definitely overpriced."
2.0,The glasses are loose. Can't get fixed.
2.0,I love this watch but I can't keep it runing
2.0,"The post was broken on one of the ear rings when it arrived.  The price was great, which made returning it less than sensible.  Oh, well..."
2.0,"This is on overrated, overpriced watch, about the only thing it dose well-asid from loking good- is tell date, month & week day. All other features such as cheap quality of a band, lack of lum or light, crapy inaccurate alarm leaves it desiring for  more. And definitely feel like a waist of 300 bucks. The fact that it has a Sapphire glass redims it a bit but still it shouldn't be worth more than 200 bucks. My personal, humble opinion."
2.0,"I liked it online but when I recieved it, it was cheap and flimsy."
2.0,The material is very thin and its runs big.
2.0,I wound up returning this. It is so much smaller and lighter than expected. I’ve bought far cheaper bracelets/chains that felt like better quality than this. I had high hopes because of the photo and the “two-tone” description. If it is two tone you cannot tell because of how small it is. Very disappointed.
2.0,1. The zipper is too cheap<br />2. It's too long for me (I'm 5'3)<br />3. Returned
2.0,The product is a great value for the money. However see my picture. The sticky label had to be washed to remove and left a stain. Plus made in China is stamped inside. Who wants to wear some thing with that plainly printed and the stain?
2.0,I liked the fit and fabric of this skirt but it felt like it had too much fabric. I ended up returning it just because it felt like too much.
2.0,Too tight and uncomfortable around biceps.
2.0,"I wear a large & bought a large & was tight pretty much all over except for the bottom of dress. Long maxi,  it didn't flow like a maxi dress should. I had to return it."
2.0,"the material is too thin after a few uses, and a couple washes, it started to rip apart.  The size did not fit me, medium was too tight, but large was too big/loose."
2.0,"I ordered a small and it was kind of loose fitting. The material was ok but, I didn't like the way it fit or looked on me. The picture online makes it look more elegant than it really is. I returned it."
2.0,"This mask is tiny. So small I can’t wear it. I’m a tall guy, but I don’t have a giant head. It looks made for children or small women."
2.0,"Really cute but I bought all 4 sizes M, L, 1X, 2X, not one fit. To small and way to big. M & L almost exactly same, 1X & 2X exactly the same. 😢"
2.0,"neckline is too deep, not appropriate for business"
2.0,Like the product... or it's potential (but super ran waaaaaaaaaay to small). Not a fan of the sizing at all; and my product was very poorly timed delivery
2.0,"Sigh, I could not fit this"
2.0,Disappointed with how many came broken considering I bough 250 bead from another distributor and only TWO came broken. This is unacceptable. 😔
2.0,"not a fan of this product. very flimsy, not at all what I was expecting, missed my window to return it"
2.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; and 130lb. Size S fit fine but longer than on he model. The color is much more yellow than in the picture where it looks almost pastel. The material is very thick and stiff looking, not summery or breathable. Wasn't a fan of how the scalloped hems looked when I put it on either. Had to return it. The return/refund  process was super easy and fast"
2.0,"The luggage was late arriving, through no fault of the seller. The USPS claimed they didn't have access to my building (even though I get mail daily), and then didn't make another attempt the next business day.<br /><br />The protective film was a nightmare, but otherwise I love the luggage. Tip: use a hairdryer on high to shrink up the tiny remnants around the edging and handles. I've already taken one trip, and the pieces I used held up extremely well. The luggage looks amazing in the dark gray with the silvery brush strokes.<br /><br />UPDATE: After the fourth or fifth trip, the wheels on the largest size cracked at the base of the luggage. In addition, the medium had an enormous split down the middle. I used the same airline as all the previous trips, so this was most likely not from typical baggage handling."
2.0,Green wrist? Watch looks great out of the box. It is easy to set and adjust the band. The problem is after wearing one day it turned my wrist green. I wear watches every day and have never had this issue.
2.0,"Too big in the bust (I'm a c cup), and too short in the skirt (I'm 5'8"").  I had to return it."
2.0,The pendant was too bog...the chain was too small.
2.0,I wore these with another pair of socks in 40 degree weather while playing an outdoor volleyball tournament and my feet were freezing the entire time!
2.0,"When I ordered this, the description says small-medium and that it fits up to a size 9.  I am usually an 8 or 8.5 and these did not fit.  I am pregnant but it was not the width that was the problem- it was the length.  Small-medium is really small, if you are an 8 or higher order a large."
2.0,Buckle falls apart when a small pin disengages and gets lost making the belt useless.
2.0,shorter than stated in description.  Not 20&#34;
2.0,Awkward and ugly material that seems more appropriate for table cloths or curtains.
2.0,"The waist line was too high. Just didn't look very good, Also be warned this is absolutely not water proof, you will get soaked.  I wore it one weekend and gave it away."
2.0,It was not what I expected.  That ok. because my sister wanted so I gave it to her
2.0,"Weird fabric and unfortunately it's hard to make out the rays. I had high Hope's, but unfortunately they were a bust."
2.0,I purchased the plus size in these based off of my regular bra size and the fact that other reviewers stated that they run small. They were huge on me! They do not do free returns so it cost me half as much as the price I paid for them to send them back. Lesson learned.
2.0,It shrank after one washing!
2.0,"Cute dress and fits well (I'm 5'6&#34;, 130#). However the liner basically covers my butt, which looks a little odd, so I returned it. I wish the liner went to the knees. Perhaps would be ok for the beach (as mentioned in the product title) but I'm not sure where else I would wear this given that the liner doesn't provide enough coverage for an otherwise elegant dress."
2.0,Returned as it had a hole in it. Much thinner than I expected.
2.0,Cheap. Color is nasty. But it was only like 12 bucks. But I have gotten much better for the same price.
2.0,"It is cute and stylish. However, the zipper separated after only using it twice. I would zip it and unzip it and it would not secure the zip. That is a disappointment."
2.0,Fit is too small for a normal head
2.0,The add says 9.25 sterling silver. It is not stamped. It was tested as a mystery metal. Very shiny and is pealing .
2.0,The chest was too loose and wais to tight.it’s doesn’t good .
2.0,It was not true to size it was smaller than expected
2.0,This not good quality for such an expensive jersey. Really like a thin long sleeved t-shirt.
2.0,everything is painted on. not real rips or pockets. it was poorly sewn as well there was thread sticking out of the inseam.
2.0,The length was fine.  The bust area ran small.
2.0,"Way, way, way too small. I can’t evaluate any more because I can’t even try them on. I have to return then"
2.0,The quality is good but the sizing is absolutely off. The description said 0-3 months and this fit my almost two year old...WAY too big!
2.0,awful smell & the colors are odd - not as shown & it had an obvious material flaw right down the middle
2.0,"It was a pretty dress but I bought the 3xl and I could not close the buttons over my chest, I returned it<br />I wear a 44 DD and was disappointed,"
2.0,I am a size 36 waist I ordered a 34 through 41 and it was too big
2.0,Very cheaply made. From China
2.0,Cheaply Made from thin plastic.  Not sure they will last if I take them in and out of my shoes. I will buy Wood ones in the future
2.0,Too big for a 5’6” guy’s head
2.0,Not as cute as the picture shows.
2.0,"I expected the bottom of the shoes to be softer, but they were still comfortable. I wore them around the house for about 2 weeks and while walking through my kitchen the right strap of the thong disconnected from the sole. Not great durability if they cant last through 2 weeks of lounge wear."
2.0,"I've purchased several ties from The Tie Bar since they first opened. It's sad that the quality of their ties has started going downhill. Normally I order via their site but these came from amazon because I needed cheap 2 day shipping. In the past the ties from Tie Bar were very thick and had nice lining. The last 5 or 6 ties I've order have lining so thin you can see a long line on the front of the tie that shows where the fabric is stitched on the back. Unfortunately, I have ties that were purchased from Target and Marshalls that are better quality. About 6 months ago I had to send back a tie twice because of the quality. I finally ordered a different model. Hopefully with the price increase they implemented a year or so ago they will reinvest in the quality of the Tie instead of sinking the dollars into celebrity advertising. I don't really care if D Wade wears Tie Bar ties. Please improve and bring back the quality ties. Oh and another thing. Every tie in this order was heavily wrinkled. When I steamed the ties they let out a putrid odor that lingered for several days."
2.0,"Studs were slanted upon arrival, gave up on trying to contact​ the seller."
2.0,"There is no glitter nor sparkle.. So, clearly I was disappointed that there wasnt any sparkle, shimmer, and no bling. I mean, the reality today requires us to wear medica protective gear. That covers our faces. My smile is 96% of my personality. So everyone should be making rhinestone, glitter, neon bright color masks!!! Even better yet!!!! Who’s going to make the first light up masks?!?"
2.0,The earrings arrived bent and out of shape.
2.0,"Um. So I bought another pair of pants on amazon that used the same product image that I LOVED, so, I thought these would be similar at least, but these have a totally different fit and material to them. First of all, these pants usually are straight leg, so that they have almost a flare look to them around your ankles - these are not like this, they actually get smaller around the ankles. I have an hour glass figure and they make my mid section look like I’m bloated or something. Overall, they just fit very odd and aren’t the least bit flattering. For reference, I’m 5’5” and 135lbs"
2.0,"Rough shirt material, cheap ironed on oversized logo, size and fit is not correct. Does not look as shown. If you want to return, you’d have to pay $6 return shipping fee."
2.0,did not like the unusual thick fabric & the print looked really tacky
2.0,"Fits fine, comfortable but loose thread throughout. I don't know how many washings it will hold up too"
2.0,Way too small in chest. Terrible material. It feels like it's made from pillow liner material.
2.0,I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and they were too small and narrow.
2.0,"TLDR; WOULD NOT RECOMMEND<br /><br />Im 5 foot 9, 150 pounds, with shoulders and a V taper.  Typical lean gym bro build.<br /><br />This fits really weird and doesn't work for me, so I don't know who it would work for. Short front, long back, weird chest lines at the chest and arm holes<br /><br />I bought a medium and I am normally a medium, a large would make me look like dobby the house elf in a pillowcase cuz the fits so weird<br /><br />Gave it to the girlfriend who is 6 inches shorter than me and its now its a nighty for her.<br /><br />Materials are nice, not cotton but definitely soft.  Cut is just really off.  Fix the fit and they'd sell a million of them."
2.0,"Size is way off.  A pull on product, but almost impossible to get your shoulders in to the top.  Once again I ordered a larger size.  Quality was not ver good."
2.0,"The glasses are nice in the sense that the frame feels solid and well made, however, the lenses do absolutely nothing to improve night vision or any other vision for that matter. It’s a shame, they are kind of cool looking, but that’s about it."
2.0,"Was so very excited when these bags arrived. They are beautiful, & because of my medical conditions I need to carry a big bag. I was. Thrilled to be able to fit what I need in big bag- with plenty of room to spare! I happily clipped the strap on. On the very first day, the clip came apart!!!!! There is no repairing it. I give up. I've ordered many bags but will NEVER do so again"
2.0,The lenses do not fit in the frame perfectly. The can lead to the lens popping out of the frame very easily.
2.0,"The measurements said 9.4 x6.3 x 3.1  instead , what I got was 7 x 5 x 3.1"
2.0,"The first time I bought this ring it came out perfect! I was exactly what the description said. I ordered a second one and it wasn’t anything like the new one. It came in a small ziplock bag, it felt thinner and the material it was made of just felt off and weak. I’m very disappointed."
2.0,"Unfortunately the strap broke where it wraps around the metal ring to connect it with the bag. This happened within the first two weeks of using the bag. Seems like it was glued and bound to happen. I found a shoe/luggage repair shop that was able to fix it for only $20. They sewed it and and reinforced the other side too so hopefully no more issues. Otherwise, I like the look of the bag. I just wish it was a tiny bit bigger."
2.0,they basically had a hard shell to them. felt like i was wearing my composite toe work boots. too big. i tried them on and they flopped off my feet.
2.0,"Not that great. It's okay, but to my sons point, it turns off to quickly."
2.0,And got ripped like on week oh used my daughter was so sad.
2.0,The first pair that I received had a piece of plastic that was broken. I sent those back and was sent a replacement pair. The replacement pair was the wrong color. I re-ordered another pair and got the correct color but the clip does not hold the laces in place like it should. I have a pair of lop lace brand laces that are wonderful but wanted a different color to match another pair of shoes. The color is perfect but they just don’t hold in place. Very disappointed!
2.0,Too small and way too wrinkly! I would sit down once and have it wrinkled for the whole day.
2.0,Nice cotton boot socks but too tight on calf.
2.0,I ordered an extra large & it’s the size of a large. It’s cute though.
2.0,"I ordered a seven and it didn't fit, it was way too small. I was able to give it to my mom, who wears a five,  so it's not a total waste."
2.0,cheap costume quality
2.0,At first I thought I liked it but after trying to use it everyday I became dissatisfied. My glasses keep slipping out of the adjustable loop no matter how much I tighten it.
2.0,way to small didn't even fit while picking an extra size up don't let the sizeing chart mislead you
2.0,Fabric doesn't really stretch really hard to get on too small
2.0,too big  and thick stem for the ear holes
2.0,"I like the protectiveness but extremely yard to open the charging port every day. Had to stop using, too heavy and kept breaking my nails."
2.0,pretty but arms way too small
2.0,"I like the way these bands feel (more comfortable than the Apple band) and how easy to install. I have several and have had no issues however the colors are terrible and not true to the photos advertised. The light colors are very grayed out and dull and because of this, I won't purchase again."
2.0,"Two stars because they are cute, but they do not stay put at all!  Can’t even wear them."
2.0,"The watch itself is beautiful. However, the seller sent it with a dead battery! Not cool!"
2.0,"I received the SnuG Watch Band yesterday, only hours after placing the order, and absolutely love it!<br /><br />The packaging was practical and efficient.. nothing over the top/wasteful- which I appreciated.<br /><br />The instructions were super easy, although I did have to slow down the video tutorial and watch it a few times to make sure I was doing it right on my end. The whole setup process took about 10 minutes.<br /><br />The band is very comfortable, sturdy yet soft, and is of higher quality than other silicone bands I've purchased in the past. The only thing that could improve the band is if it was made to be breathable... perhaps tiny holes throughout the band or slight grooves on the inside that would allow for airflow? This would be ideal for those who sweat a lot when they work out or live on the surface of the sun, ie: Phoenix 🙋(&#60;-- like me).<br /><br />Other than that, I love it!!<br /><br />Update -- 6/22/18<br /><br />Although I'm pleased with the band, I'm disappointed with the customer service. I contacted the company on two separate occasions regarding questions I had about ordering an additional band and they never replied..<br /><br />To me, customer service is paramount therefore I dropped my 5 star rating to a 2."
2.0,"Price was great, but very dull looking. Seems as though they forgot to add the silver finish to the pendant."
2.0,REALLY CHEAP AND FLIMSY
2.0,I am much larger than the model but making concessions for a larger this size I was not happy with this product.
2.0,These scarves are very very thin.  You can see through the fabric.  I would rather have had half the amount and better quality fabric for the money!  I am using them to make Covid masks.
2.0,I liked the design but not the shiny flimsy fabric.
2.0,shrunk from the bottom up after the first wash. cute belly shirt now for 200lb man
2.0,Way too small I bought 2 sizes above what I wear and in it’s still way to small to even put on.  The fabric and garment itself was nice. I wear an XL and bought a 3X and can’t even get into it.  Their 3X is like a US size medium
2.0,Not as pictured. It’s not as long and the size is off. It barely covers my bottom.  It appears made well but will have to wear it and give it a go first. Will keep it because I need something like this to wear over my tank at work.
2.0,"The designs are cute, but the masks are not contoured to stay close to the face-- even if you make the earloops smaller. Therefore 2/5 stars"
2.0,"This just...ugh. Looked so terrible on me.<br />Fit: I'm 5'7/122 lbs and I don't have narrow hips, so the skirt fit very awkwardly on my body. It bunches and puckers slightly on either side, particularly where the hidden zipper is. The hidden elastic waistband is a huge plus, though, and that part fit my waist well. Probably someone with narrow hips would look like a little siren in this skirt, but it looked horrendous on me. True midi-length.<br />Quality: the material itself is actual quite good, and doesn't look tragically cheap or like wanna-be lingerie like some satin skirts and dresses. The color definitely reads more as metallic."
2.0,I should have checked the sizes and where it was coming from. Way too small.
2.0,Runs verrrrry snug on arms
2.0,Pants are a very dull shade. Not as pictured
2.0,These are so tiny!  If I had known I would have gotten plates elsewhere<br />Totally not worth the $
2.0,Does not cover the bust as expected and was too small.
2.0,These fell apart after one washing.
2.0,"Cheap, thin and ugly!"
2.0,"I wear a 12-14 in US Dress size.  I ordered this in an X-Large afraid my fat arms would not fit in the tight sleeves.  I have a 40&#34; bust.  This dress was way way too tight around my bust and despite the size-up adjustment tight too around my arms.  I have a true hourgass figure (never mind the fat arms).  40&#34; bust, about 23-24&#34; waist, 42&#34; hips.  One would think this dress in X-large would fit.  NO GO!  The hip part in X-Large was ok, but the rest, ridiculous.<br /><br />I gave the dress 2 stars because it's not atrocious in design.  The purple, which I bought (returning it now, see above) was a little less classy than I would have liked in tone -- could have been brought down a notch, but not horrible at all.  The detail around the waist was quite nice, but without a fit who really cares???"
2.0,Material is very thin and smaller than usual
2.0,Material is too clingy for my liking.
2.0,Not sweatpants.  Thin material like pjs.
2.0,The shoe is made for a person with narrow feet.
2.0,I am pretty sure it shrunk and it’s hard to keep white. Like it got dull pretty quickly?
2.0,"The mask streched to fast, the part around the ears. It looks good , but started to go down of my facet."
2.0,"5Mayi Mens Boxer Briefs Pack of 6 Wide Waistband Mens Underwear<br /><br />Fit is fine, the waistband is better than average.  My caution is for men expecting the inseam length to be typical for a &#34;boxer brief&#34;, it wasn't.  These fit like standard briefs.  If you live somewhere warm and your inner thighs occasionally rub, you may buy boxer briefs to get a bit more coverage.  After the 1st wash, these simply didn't extend more than an inch below the crotch.  Product doesn't specify inseam in the descricption, and my experience was that it is minimal."
2.0,I've had this strap on my mandolin for quite awhile but I rarely actually use it because it doesn't stay in the position it is adjusted to. It constantly loosens on you and the hole that goes over the tailpiece peg is REALLY loose so you can't trust it to hold the weight of the mandolin. There have been several times where my mandolin has fallen due to this but luckily I react quickly enough in anticipation because I know I can't trust it and I end up catching the strap before the mandolin hits the ground. If you have an expensive mandolin I WOULD NOT TRUST THIS STRAP!
2.0,It was not like the other 3 I purchase. I was disappointed with this one.
2.0,"I'm hard pressed to find anything I like about this.  It arrived with the chain in knots.  I really dislike these thin chains that can get knotted.  I worked on this one for half an hour and was never able to get the knot out, so I've given up.  The whole piece is super lightweight, very little silver here.  I think it's very overpriced.  The pendant is small and not impressive, with a tiny little stone.  Even if I hadn't been so frustrated with the chain, I don't think this is something I'd wear.  Not something I would recommend."
2.0,Material is nice but these definitely are not comparable to NVGTN (at least not their latest release). I agree with a previous review about the too much fabric in the crotch area. Maybe it's just the blue color because that's the one I got as well.<br /><br />These also run larger than the Nvgtn ones. I don't recommend to size up.
2.0,Not very good quality but can complain wasn't very expensive.
2.0,We received two pot plants and two random creatures that were unrecognizable in our batch of decorations. They were four additional defective ones that had color issues and missing detail.
2.0,The size chart wasn't accurate.
2.0,"I like the style of the bag , I know it says faded look but was disappointed how dull and washed out the colours are , almost to the point of looking very dirty , colours are nothing like the picture '"
2.0,The color is already coming off and it is way too big for my wrist
2.0,"They look great but the yarn kept snagging against the zipper of my boots.  By the end of  the day, loose yarn are all over and bottons are hanging. I used another color the next day, lost both buttons by mid day."
2.0,"These are much thinner in real life, than what is shown in the photo. : ("
2.0,Looks okay but made of plastic kind of junky looking.
2.0,"Beautiful color, and nice material but the dress fit about 2 sizes smaller than what I was expecting unfortunately."
2.0,"I like to feel cotton on my skin, but this tank tops are way too small. I am classic XL and I ordered XL, but this is a medium size. I didn't sent it back, just because my daughter, who wears medium, wants them."
2.0,Able to see straight through this dress since the material is super thin.
2.0,I bought this product in a 2X and I knew it should have been a little loose but because it was made in China it just fit. I’m a truck driver and sweatpants are great for comfort warmth and ability to move but these pants are going to be for just hanging out in because of the size and now I have to purchase them again but in a bigger size
2.0,Didn't like the way it hung on my body.....too clingy....and the light blue was a bit see through.  Had to return it.
2.0,nice but it's too big
2.0,"I was excited for this dress to have a little variety in my wardrobe but I will never wear this. The fabric is thin and you can see what you're wearing underneath.  It is not flowy like the model in the picture, but instead more straight and snug on the body. I went by measurements from the company, but it definitely runs smaller."
2.0,"The amount of black live matter ones was ridiculous!!! A couple? Great, but half of the bag was Black Lives Matter. I was looking forward to more Disney ones."
2.0,The sweater was much brighter in color than I’d expected and it fit small. Much shorter than pictured.
2.0,"The band itself is well made. It's a good product. It has a good feel to it.<br /><br />I feel bad giving it two stars but feel like I have to do to the lack of response from the makers. Truffol, despite their effort to project themselves as a company that cares, with their thoughtful note within the band case and follow up e-mails asking for reviews, have done nothing to try and resolve my issue. If you do decide to buy a band from them, make sure you get exactly what you want, it costs $7 to return this $15 band.<br /><br />The problem I had was that the band was to wide for my watch. After hearing nothing from Truffol about any way to try and figure out a solution that didn't involve me paying half of what it cost me to return it, I decided to buy a, albeit lesser quality, four pack of watch bands from Ritche.  I used the thinner pins that came with these and cut notches on the truffol band. Working well for me so far."
2.0,Does not fit my ear well.  Needs additional length options.
2.0,The polar bear is extremely cute but it came in filthy.
2.0,Uncomfortable fit. returned  for refund.
2.0,Color is not green it's real so I'm highly disappointed in color which I paid for green as advertised! Please advertise correct colors!
2.0,"Loved the look of this dress. Bought it of Easter. Was so disappointed with the fit! Sort of big and boxy, but very tight in the chest (and mine you, I am a small B cup)"
2.0,I don’t wear it a lot and the paint is wearing I’ve only had it about a month
2.0,"This is a very cute vest, however it is about 4 sizes too small. Sizing is not American. Very disappointed."
2.0,"The pendant I felt was a little too thick, and bulky, which made it not so feminine. It’s just about the thickness of a quarter. The chain looks cheap, and the clasp on the chain was a tiny bit open, which is just screaming for the clasp to open.. so, I chose to return it. Maybe my next purchase will be better"
2.0,"cheaply made, but ok"
2.0,these are high quality glasses but the problem I have with them is they are far to light in terms of the shading of the lens.  Glare is bad and when wearing on a bright Las Vegas  day they really don't provide much relief from the sun.  I bought these for driving so I could see my heads up display on my car.  The lack of glare reduction is a problem for me
2.0,It was small and very thin.
2.0,Very long I will be returning
2.0,"I got this mask bc I LOOOOVE foxes.  Like I followed a white fox until I couldn’t drive where s/he ran off to.  So I get anything foxy & cute.  The fabric is lovely - prob polyester but it’s very soft & not delicate (which is great for an “every day” item).  Even the inner layer is nice & soft.  Ear straps are easy to adjust.  No complaints about the overall quality.<br /><br />The problem is the cut.  Bc the fabric is soft & doesn’t hold its shape, it flares out on the sides. I thought I could fix that by tightening the straps & adjusting it to be tighter around the bottom instead of being even (so when I pulled the strap the part of the elastic over my ear was long & the part under my ear was very short).  That made it fit pretty much right up against my entire face, so there was no room to breathe.  And since it’s not a breathable fabric, I really couldn’t breathe in it (esp since it’s still summer).<br /><br />Couldn’t I just wear it looser?  Yeah, I could.  But since the sides flare out so much it basically defeats the purpose of a mask & I might as well just wear it over my mouth only — but if you aren’t going to cover your nose you might as well not even wear a mask at all.  And even tho the adults are vaccinated we have children too young to be vaccinated & 2 are “immunocompromised” (one cannot get regular childhood vaccines).  So we are especially mindful of hygiene & try not to bring anything home to infect our kids with.<br /><br />I suspect I could use this mask with one of those silicone frames, but I don’t know how the sizing works with those.  And honestly, I don’t like wearing a mask in the first place (even tho I wear mine religiously), so adding an extra piece to something I already dislike would just make it so much worse.  I’m going to keep this one in my car for “emergencies” so I can pretend that I didn’t waste my money on something I won’t use.  But it is very nice to look at.  And perhaps when we no longer *need* to wear masks, I’ll recycle it into something for the doll house. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,Ordered a size larger than normal and it is still way too small. :(
2.0,Only the black one will open and reclose. The others are both just too stiff to get open and close.
2.0,Didn’t even last 5 months and the sole split in half.
2.0,"I weigh 120 lbs,  I'm 5'8. I ordered an X Large. It's very small... And I mean very small.  If you're my size order a 2x... It will fit with your clothes under it.  The fabric is light and really cheap.  You get what you pay for with this item.. 🤔👎👎👎👎"
2.0,First pair I received was broken in the package but readily replaced. Second pair broke in my bag in the same place before I even got to wear them :(
2.0,Was so excited to recieve this. I ordered a large which is my typical size but I think this is large in kids because no way a large is this small . :( order up in your size!
2.0,That’s all.
2.0,Issues with sewing . Too many strings. The belt tie wasn't pulled completely around so it's impossible to get tie string through the other side.<br />Clearly manufacturing doesn't bother looking at finished product
2.0,"Dress was great but broke when out to eat…. And that means… the girls are no longer covered. We were able to fix in the bathroom but by the end of the night, both straps had broken and we had to change clothes."
2.0,"It looks super cute when it's on and under a shirt....and it fit around (I wear a 38D)...<br /><br />However it only covered like the bottom half of my boob, so I have to wear a regular bra over it...<br /><br />And there are 2 straps connected right as it goes over ur shoulder that broke right when I tried it on😬<br /><br />Smaller chested gals I think this would be perfect for!"
2.0,"Not what is pictured, the quality is great however, but it is not slouchy at all its a just a generic beanie. The 2 stars are for the excellent quality"
2.0,"There externally threaded so not suitable for lip piercing, and the bottom part ripped off as soon as I tried to put it in"
2.0,It broke the second I wore it !
2.0,Length of shirt was too short for an XL size.
2.0,It was a nice watch but to bulky and heavy.
2.0,"I like the earring, it's very pretty and all, but I got it broken which is very annoying. At least it's fixable but I shouldn't have to fix it."
2.0,the material is so thin that holes are easily torn
2.0,The angel was huge and not very attractive.
2.0,Fit in my kid great
2.0,Returning - too small and material was rough
2.0,I'm 5'2&#34; 115 lbs and ordered a small which is what I always wear. The fit was awkward. I'm not sure a medium would have been better. Returning.
2.0,"Its a nice bag for the price, but it is not a laptop bag, it is more like a catch all bag. It dose not have a way of securing your laptop."
2.0,Broke within a few days. I love lia Sophia
2.0,"Sientan bien y no son del todo incomodos, pero el pie no transpira y la suela es muy fina. Para la oficina estan bien pero no para caminar, te destrozan los pies. No esta hecho con buenos materiales."
2.0,The first pair I bought for my son broke within a couple weeks
2.0,There ok its like you just get whatever they got leftover some one then didnt even have matching one
2.0,I hit the re-order button on here and got a different size. Took the tags off cant return. What's the deal? No consistency
2.0,"Looks good, but it just fell apart immediately. Two stars for the price though. Bought it with money found in the couch."
2.0,Pretty and cutty earrings unfortunately very cheap silver. Easy to break!
2.0,"It's still in my closet. I haven't worn it yet. I have a couple other dresses that have the collar, but this collar is just nothing like the other ones I have, in a bad way. The material of the collar is way TOO THICK for my liking. (It almost feels like I am wearing a cheap costume). That being said, I do like the length. The skater fit is nice, I like that as well. There are two seams on the chest that bug me a little, and I wish they weren't there.<br />I guess my overall recommendation is:<br />If I knew what I do now, I probably wouldn't have bought it, but because I do have it, it's not the worst dress in the world, but it definitely isn't the best either. It probably won't be worn often and when I do wear it it will probably be at night, when it is dark. Hah."
2.0,wish they were not heavy
2.0,Not easily worn.
2.0,I bought these because as my waitress uniform I need black plain pants. I’m usually a medium and according to the size chart that is what I ordered.. but they were way too loose. So much so that I don’t use them for what intended I only use them as pj pants when I’m bloated and still too loose and stretch out throughout the day. I should have gotten the small or even extra small. I’m a 5/7 in jeans. So I suggest you size down. The material is thick and comfy so at least there is that.
2.0,Very cute! My daughter loves them but the backs are not sticky for very long.
2.0,"This product has a really nice frame and looks great.  I purchased them for driving.<br /><br />But, I haven't been able to adjust to the progressiveness of the glass while driving. I can see the console, but, I'm not able to see the street signs.  This maybe a great glass to wear at the beach while seating in a chair."
2.0,Too small and tight not good for a plus size. I sent this back and had to pay postage.
2.0,Came packaged nice but think they feel cheap and no backs to hold them on are included.  Thought they would be a lot prettier.
2.0,I love the cut and shape of this dress but the strap broke the first time I wore it and it is very thin and see through material.
2.0,I didn’t like the way the skirts laid. The side hems didn’t sit right. The skirt materials are super thin so the hems don’t even lay flat and overall it just isn’t flattering.
2.0,Goggles doesn't fit well.
2.0,"When opening up these gloves, they looked fairly well made. However, when putting them on, the half glove fingers are so tight that after a few moments  my fingers started to lose feeling. I have a super narrow hand with long fingers and have never experienced a glove like this. It's as if it was made for a child's hand. I checked to make sure I had ordered the correct adult size, and I had.The material is not very stretchy which would at least have made using it tolerable. Cannot recommend."
2.0,I hate poorly mad sleeves on clothes and this one is. The arms are too baggy and does not fit well.  It's a shame because I was really excited about this blouse.😔
2.0,Poor workmanship... visor sewed on crooked...
2.0,They look great in your hand before you put them on. They feel good on and I think they would be good socks if there wasn’t an if. I’m not sure how to describe it. The weave or the thread count between the ankle and the heel is a very open weave. I can see the skin of my foot in this area. I’m worried the socks will fail here after a while. None of the other socks I purchase have this issue  (is only  my opinion but this may be a design flaw) so I will continue buying those other socks and pass on these that I’m not sure of.
2.0,I was so excited to wear this cute skirt for the first time and I never got to.  So bummed
2.0,This was over all a cute costume just poor material also it fit a little big I’m 5’4 34-24-40 and the medium was way too big
2.0,"It would have been a nice shirt if it fit. I am only 5'2&#34; and it was way too short. I have gotten x-small t-shirts from Forever 21, Old Navy, Kohls, J.C.Penneys, Target and Walmart which all fit me great to wear under sleeveless or see-through tops. I wanted this t-shirt and color for the same reason, so I got x-small. I'm not familiar with UK sizes, but says to get one size bigger, but other reviews said their normal US size in it fit well, so I stuck with the x-small. This shirt is way too small for an x-small. It looks like a childs large/xlarge shirt with not much chest and arm room for a woman. I can't even see this fitting a Junior unless that Junior was under 5' tall and slender. It does not stretch much either like the normal t-shirts I got from stores I mentioned above. Also, I've never seen a t-shirt for a woman made that short and small in the length, bodice and arm-holes. I do like the dye/color and stitching. Too bad it won't fit. It's a thin shirt but not see-through. In the included picture, I put one of my normal x-small t-shirts next to it to show you the difference between them."
2.0,"Just received this product.  It is very cute but like other customers noted, the top of the hat is separating from the inner Styrofoam mold.  I have glued the top back down and will hope it holds."
2.0,"These basically just make any lights at night yellow instead of white. I don't feel they make anything much clearer. They really don't help with the brightness of the oncoming headlights, especially the newer obnoxious LED ones.  So unfortunately, not what I was hoping for"
2.0,"The paint job and sculpt looks great, unfortunately you'd have to have either a tiny nose or none to wear it properly.<br /><br />Modifications will definitely need to be made, some sort of padding between your face and the mask is needed. Also the straps do little to keep it in place.<br /><br />Id recommend only if you're willing to make modifications if not probably not the purchase for you.."
2.0,"Nice material, but too tight."
2.0,Not soft material and cheap looking
2.0,"I ordered the white and it is way too see through to wear, even with nude bra and underwear. The material is thin polyester and provides no coverage. The dress itself is cute, just poor quality."
2.0,"The dress didnt look exactly like the photo, it was shorter than I expected and very tight across the shoulders."
2.0,"The dress was much smaller than measurements should have indicated. The fabric was really nice, and the pockets are perfect. I'll give it to a more petit friend, so it isn't a total loss."
2.0,"The quality of the plastic/silicone strap was not as good or stretchy. I always have a hard time taking out my watch to charge. Also the band causes irritation on my skin if it was too close on my wrist. The band, I feel was put wrong. It was also hard to take it off due to this mistake."
2.0,I previously ordered the same hair nets. They were a different texture and smaller this time.
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Cheap fabric, mildly see through and constantly pulling them up.<br />I use them as pajamas now.<br />It's not the makers fault, but I'm not good looking enough to wear these in public so I don't."
2.0,"This was pretty cheap looking, and won't be very durable. Biggest complaint from my wife is the bands don't stay in place and keep covering up the charms"
2.0,Had to return size to small poor quality boot ...
2.0,"It's so small, you can't even read the 2021 without a magnifying glass."
2.0,"Very small!! And not as pictured. The sides do not conform to your face like the picture shows. The straps are stitched into the end of the fabric, the picture shows the mask gathering on the sides. It's worth a dollar, maybe 5 dollars for 4. But it's not even close to being worth 8 bucks."
2.0,The material on this is not nearly as nice as the solid colors. It is a good length for a shirt--not a nightgown. Buy the solid color nightgowns instead.
2.0,I've had them for 2 days and 2 of the backs have already popped off. Not very impressed by these.
2.0,I liked the style but they came bent. Had to return.
2.0,"I have three pairs of this type of shoe in the name brand and love them. so I was happy to see these at a much lower price - until I put them on.  When I first put them on I was disappointed and thinking they were too small because the fabric at the front crushed my toes like when you wear tights with boots and a couple of times during the day you have to remove your boots to pull the toe of the tights off your toes.  This wasn't quite as bad as that but it was uncomfortable.<br />When I looked closer, the sole was sticking out from the back of my heel by a generous half inch and when I pulled the shoe forwards so my heel was at the back the fit was perfect.  Until I picked my foot up off the floor and the stretchy upper pulled the shoe backwards again, crushing my toes and leaving the empty half inch of sole sticking out the back.<br />I have pretty standard feet, 7.5 to an 8, medium width, nothing weird.  So I have to assume that these are just made incorrectly.  A pity because I like the design but I will never wear them."
2.0,I would never buy this luggage again.  Did not last two trips. I used it for a trip to Ireland and one handle ripped completely off.  Took on another trip trying to get my money's worth out of it and the other handle ripped off.  Left with luggage with no handles.  Had to stop my trip and purchase tie wraps and tape to make it home.  Now it's going in the trash.  I don't think I need say more.  So disappointed.
2.0,"Stiff shorts, not soft linen as I was expecting. Cut a bit small in my opinion. Length good."
2.0,"They are cute, but after one wear it already has signs of fraying."
2.0,"As an Olukai loyalist I am extremely disappointed with these sandals. I have worn Ohana's for 7 years and loved them. I purchased these, as I liked the sole a bit more. So why no love? The leather where the medallion is cuts into top of foot. The left sandal is extremely snug. You may have to grease up your foot to get to slide in. I reached out to Olukai, help desk and they mentioned email the warranty department in which has yet to respond. Therefore I giving the Ohanas 4 stars, but the Kipis 1 star and the Olukai support 2 stars. I would recommend purchasing in a store to save yourself the hassle of losing time and money. I prefer this route with foorwear, but in the Tampa Bay area, not one of the listed dealers had this sandal in stock and maybe for good reason."
2.0,"The size is smaller then mentioned in the chart!<br /><br />Size US Medium Order Date: December 3, 2017"
2.0,"I bought a pair a couple months ago and they were too big. So i gave them to my niece instead of exchanging them.I bought the correct size this time and as comfortable as they look,they really aren't SO COMFY! It's really hot here now,so when it gets colder ill give them a try."
2.0,Good for thinner socks but for being Spyder brand I thought they’d be much thicker/warmer
2.0,To small and only 3 months
2.0,Great price but material is not as expected
2.0,Not as long as expected and very large!
2.0,"I got this for my daughter.  The same day she got it, the jingles started falling off.  We love the sound, but after wearing it for only 4 days, shes down to 4 jingles on them. I wouldn't recommend buying this."
2.0,"Not as easy as it looks and not for every hair, tried it on several friends and reverse. None of us could use it."
2.0,"I ordered this for a friend of mine who does not like to wear polyeseter, but is not opposed to a few synthetics now and then.  She just had a baby and I wanted to get her in between clothing which would help her be comfortable until she lost weight again.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes folded in a zipper topped plastic bag.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />The fabric of this is ridiculously thin.  You can SEE THROUGH IT.  Not only that it is polyester and it is hot to wear.  I tested it out and it was awful for me to wear in terms of hot in a warm climate.<br /><br />COLOR<br />This is an ivory color which is pretty.<br /><br />STYLE<br />The style is nice and flattering.<br /><br />FIT<br />I wear a size 14-16 misses US and this in a size LARGE fits but XL would be better.  My friend wears a 12-14 and this fits her nicely.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a nice style and flattering but the fabric is horrible.  It is hot to wear, catches on my skin constantly and is see through.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  I really don't like this fabric at all.  It is still really see through with a cami on.  The third photo I posted shows my hand through the fabric.  It is much worse in person."
2.0,"This dress is made for a very petite body type. For me, the bra area cut above my chest and the pockets fell at my upper ribs."
2.0,Super cute boots but run really small
2.0,"Have to ditto the review By  Martha A. Fargusson  on February 16, 2016. Love the look, but it needs to be better attached.  I gave this as a gift and they didn't even get to wear it.  Won't do that again. You get what you pay for!"
2.0,"Loved the bathing suit, but it didn't even last 1 swim season! It started fading in the back, and because it isn't 2 ply material, you could see through the bathing suit. A real bummer."
2.0,"With a name like G.I. Jewelry you would think this is a man's size item. Not going to bother sending it back maybe my niece, or sister will like it. The chain is very cheep looking, but the charm is nice, so deserves more then one star."
2.0,"The small pieces that surround the stone are losing their blue color, I guess it’s chipping of it’s disappointing at best I won’t buy from these people again"
2.0,Looked good in pictures. Easy to read and nice long necklace. Construction poor. Back kept falling off in normal wear.
2.0,Too small n short for tall women
2.0,Sized to small
2.0,"These pants fit like a glove and are really cute! But after two wears, the seam ripped on both sides of the crotch. Very disappointed with the quality"
2.0,To short in the waste if you are tall.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:d6ad3038763460bc55ef8ded82b14dba]] Like but to small
2.0,I liked the design that I reordered it in a larger size.  The cup size is definitely small. I ordered an XL (14) with a 36 D chest.  Not enough room
2.0,"The style of the skirt was not as flowing on me as the model, decided to go with a different cover up."
2.0,"the fit was ok, although a bit short for my middle-aged self!  sadly i did return this dress because the fabric was less than desirable.  it was a completely wrinkled mess, and all i could forsee was having to iron this every time i washed it.  cute style though."
2.0,"Running small is the understatement of the year. I’m a 1X so I ordered 3X to be extra sure. I will share with my friend who is a medium. I’m not confident  it would even fit her.<br /><br />But based on what I paid, I’m not too worried."
2.0,This hat was smaller than expected.
2.0,"The Amazon photograph of the dress showed border material on the sleeves and bodice. The cut of the fabric is inconsistent in the product I received and renders the dress unattractive. Also the fabric design is not as crisp, the white is dull, a bit on the grey-yellowed side, as if it had been washed before being sent to me. It came without a product tag. Will return."
2.0,No built in bra like the description says. The other 5 shirts I ordered did.
2.0,"I don't like this, the material is scratchy and holds a lot of static cling.."
2.0,Three out of the four pairs the post backs were broken off.And one pair the fringe was hanging off/had came unglued.I liked the design and colors but am going to have to repair these and hope they work.
2.0,Thought this hat would be more a costume type hat not a fully insulated hat.  Gave to my husband as a Christmas present and he said it was too small and that if he were going to wear it at our annual Christmas Vacation tree lighting party he would get too warm.
2.0,I am i little unhappy with the looms i got they r both 2 different colors and one looks lie its been sitting in a smokers house for years if they was the same color and clear id love it
2.0,The picture is a bit misleading. I thought there will be two key chains not one.
2.0,It wasn't as I expected it.  The color is very dark and the material is kind of thin.  It's probably prettier in the lighter colors?  For me I just didn't like it.  I have other tops from Laksmi and I Love them.  This one just wasn't good for me.
2.0,Wasn't too impressed.  It's huge.  I'm going to have to pay to have links taken out if I'm ever going to wear it.  This would fit a man's wrist.
2.0,"I thought these would be good for yoga, but they do not work. They do grip to the mat, but your foot does not stay in the sock. My foot was sliding all over the place, almost made me fall a couple of times."
2.0,I’m a big through big brother big sister and bought these for my little and mines 1 year match anniversary and these are kind of big for a bracelet and the little sister one broke
2.0,Too small for my needs.  Better for a child.
2.0,Need to order 2 or 3 sizes up. It's very small
2.0,It came with a large hole in the seam. One of the cross strap fell off after first wash.
2.0,Belt buckle is stitched in place and can not be reversed.  The integral sliding belt loop is only black even though the leather belt is black on one side and brown on the other. Believe this belt was manufactured incorrectly to be advertised as being reversible.  I can only use it as a black belt.<br />Double D
2.0,This  sunglasses I order ha a few defects a few bumps
2.0,"I am rating this 2 stars because the bag was as pictured, however the zipper had not been attached correctly. I was to use this bag for school and now I cannot due to this manufacturing error. I had unzipped the bag to look inside and the zipper came off completely. I am disappointed that this bag didn’t come well made."
2.0,"this is hot  and I mean hot when I got up from the zummanity show my whole back was sweaty, and aint no back, lol but its cute I would not buy them in other colors because its not a top 8 for me, I can upload a pic but only have one and you cannot see the back. I don't like the material"
2.0,This band does not fit the Gear 2.
2.0,"Looks great but the finish doesn't even last two weeks. I bought it as a placeholder while my wedding ring is being worked on and it's beautiful but within a week and a half is turning my finger green. I've even been taking it off to shower and sleep and it still didn't last. Disappointed. I expected a cheap, basic ring given the price but I expected it to last at least a little longer"
2.0,"The color was off, and it fit tight across the chest.  Size up if you have big boobs!"
2.0,"Poorly made, loose threads."
2.0,"The logo is good but you can tell the T-shirt quality is low. It shrinks in the dryer on medium heat, it is thin and feels cheap. Big disappointment considering the price."
2.0,"I am now wondering if this is a knock off The North Face.  When I received it, I of course wanted to try it on.<br /> My usual size is a small/medium but wanting an oversized this time I went with a large.  I am not joking when I said it took all my effort to get it over my head, and I am not big at all, and neither is my head.  I seriously about had a panic attack after it was on because it was that tight around my neck!  I do buy The North Face products often and have never had one of their items fit like this so maybe it is a knockoff.  Otherwise, it is very pretty, soft and well made.  Since I tried it on and make up got on it, I kept it and thought maybe I would try cutting it under the chin so I can try not turning blue while wearing it."
2.0,Disappointing it doesn't hold the Fitbit in place it's loose and falls out.
2.0,Small- they don’t have much stretch at all and slide down easily.
2.0,They ripped to fast. Material was somewhat to cheap. Had to tie it on the actual glasses.
2.0,This is false advertising the top is a string you have to make a shirt that looks similar to the top.
2.0,Shirt was snug in fit. Should have sized up but ultimately returned because the center stitching of the lace does not align with the center of the shirt just right so looked wonky and bothered me.
2.0,Very cute product but came broken. Make sure you're handy with crafts before purchasing
2.0,Cheap material and the boning is made out of plastic. Returned it as soon as I saw it.
2.0,"Too small on top and too big and long on bottom hem.  Nice style, but not a good fit for me."
2.0,Material wasn’t what I expected. It’s shiny like an old lady nightgown.
2.0,"Very short. Should remove the word &#34;board&#34; in the description.  Very deceptive sales practice. I as well as the others, I'm sure don't appreciate being deceived.  The gains made by deceiving will be lost."
2.0,"Admittedly, I am a bit hippy in my body shape. I'm roughly a size 16, give or take on the brand. As such, I made sure to select plus size when ordering my 3 pack of these leggings. When they were delivered, they were packed nicely and clearly labeled as plus size. Great. Upon opening, these leggings were ssssssooooooooo soft and seemed to have a good stretch. I slipped them on and the first thing I notice is the the bottom cuff at the calf is a hard stitch and slightly narrow - not a big deal, I just pulled them up slightly to right below the knee and all was comfortable.<br /><br />Now, when I looked in the mirror, they appeared fine enough from the front (no awkward pulling or fit) and they appeared to fit well from the back. However, they are clearly see through, even without bending or squatting (just standing there). I don't mind a pantyline, and pretty much expect it with tight leggings. That being said, you could clearly see whatever color my underwear were no matter what kind I wore except nude colored. I was hoping to wear these with a basic work out tank to my gym for yoga, elliptical, etc. - not squats or anything that might cause a see through stretch. I don't think I'll be doing that though given the transparency issue. I've attached a photo for reference (it happened in all three colors but I only uploaded a picture of the red).<br /><br />With all that being said, they are comfortable and soft. I guess I could wear them around my house or possibly out if I had a long enough tunic length top that covers my behind. Just a disappointed since I can't really use them for the purpose for which I bought them. As of right now I'm planning on doing a return/refund if possible."
2.0,The brim of this hat is twice the size of your average hat. Literally makes it difficult to see. I wouldn't recommend it
2.0,"This bathing suit is super sexy, and looks great on! Sad part is that it’s definitely not meant to get wet. I was in the pool for only about 30 minutes and the metal started to discolor the suit and burn my skin!"
2.0,"The quality is very cheap and light. You won't get that from the picture. The one that I got had defects on the Cross. And because it is double linked, the beads lockup really bad instead of flowing like other rosaries. A tip for anyone who might return the item is to keep their shipping envelope because my mailman will not provide one for me. He said that I would have to buy my own envelope or box. But the envelope or box would be about the same price as the rosary so returning the item was not worth it. The only good quality is that it glows."
2.0,The band is very stiff. This makes it very uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,one of the earring was discolor and they look cheap.
2.0,I love the color and pattern but it was packaged in a small plastic bag all rolled up. Now it has bumps from the rolls and I can't get them out.  Now I'm looking for a new tie and need it by tonight.
2.0,They didn't come with ear ring backs and they look cheap. The paint on them looks old and I don't plan on ever wearing them.
2.0,Way way bigger than they should be. Order two sizes down.
2.0,Alot shorter than expected
2.0,"The sunglasses are fine. I however, received the wrong colors. I ordered a three pack of white Blue and yellow but received pink blue and black."
2.0,"Beautiful chain, super delicate. Already broken with after a weeks normal wear. Not an every day wear sort of necklace."
2.0,The maximum width of the band while still slotted is kind of small so I have to undo it fully to put it on and take it off.
2.0,retuened
2.0,"There is no cushion in these boots, the size fits good but I will definitely have to put in some kind of insole. I feel every pebble I walk on."
2.0,"Thought I'd love the jacket for all the ways it was the perfect adv jacket, but literally the second time wearing, the velcro came UNGLUED from the rubber wrist tabs. Glued? Then the stitching started coming apart and fraying, like they used the cheapest, free thread that China could possibly produce. Had a friends daughter completely re-sew every seam (I really wanted to like and keep this jacket). Then on a long trip with it, the zipper pull broke itself. A sleeve adjuster (thin rubber with a snap) tore itself off (I actually found the torn-off end, but it's where it attaches, so there's no way to fix). Overall, the jacket is a fail. Looked good, but made so China-cheap that I have no doubt it would disintegrate if I ever hit pavement wearing it. Looking for something, ANYTHING, other than Tourmaster. No more Tourmaster anything for me!"
2.0,The back of the hat should have been shown. It has the stupid pull buckle strap to tighten to fit instead of the closed fitted.
2.0,These run an entire size too small.  They're cute but not worth the pain of exchanging.  I just returned them.
2.0,"The quality of the material feels and looks good. However the sizes are way too small, not actual size on tag."
2.0,"This band has a nice feel in your hand. Unfortunately it doesn't fit my VivoMove HR at all. The enclosed pins feel right out when I installed them on the watch. Luckily I had a couple extra 20 mm pins that were compatible with the band so I am able to use it. If you don't have extra pins, don't buy this band for the vivomove hr. The band does loosen throughout the day, I do find myself tightening it. I suppose it moves vs. digging into my wrist when I flex my wrist. I haven't had the magnet come lose at all."
2.0,The chain turned brown on me
2.0,This has a flimsy frame in that it is very moldavle to any shape.
2.0,"Item clearly states pants included. Well, guess what???  No pants were included. What a rip off!!! This was a Christmas present…"
2.0,They didn't last long! And I had to use another mold set!
2.0,"The bands fit fine at first. Not the most comfortable, the material is pretty rough. The plastic piece you move to tighten it is constantly moving and making my watch too loose. Theyre not terrible, but I won't be reccomending them to any of my friends."
2.0,Was cute.. but unfortunately the clasp broke after only a couple of wearings.
2.0,Was intended for short ppl. Was very pretty and what I wanted until I couldn't pull the pants out of my crouch. :/
2.0,It is not the quality of the image displayed
2.0,we’re okay boots. I sent them back because I didn’t feel they were quality and would last
2.0,The positive. This is super soft. It has a nice casual flow fit not sloppy to big fit.<br />Down side. I washed on cold and air flow knit in the dryer and what I pulled out was not what I put in. It was a only in tv kind of moment. The shirt went in as an adult size medium and came out as a kids medium. Couple shakes and it stretched out but not to wear with leggings. It will be good to wear in casual didn't shave kinda days with regular pants. It is a bit see through. I'm 5'6&#34; and 130lb. Hope this helped.
2.0,"Love the ring, got a size 8 and it fit like the size but I went to sleep wearing it and my finger swelled so bad I could not remove it.  Had to go to the hospital for them to remove it for me, sad case.  Shipping was very fast and it's a great ring for others just not for me."
2.0,"I must say my first impression was wow these are so cool!  They came protected in a cardboard box not just a case which was not the same for the other two that I ordered together.  The goggles looked high quality and came with earplugs and nose plugs (which I didn't use).  They were so reflective that it was hard for me to take a picture without reflexing anything.  I had to put up a silver tray to provide a neutral pattern in the goggle's lens and one of the pictures it showed through the case (this is with the protective sticker that I move just prior to swimming).<br />While these looked really cool and fit was fine there were two issues I had.  I had no problems out of the water and could see find but once I got in the water the goggles were blurry and I felt that I need to get my eyes checked.  My other two children tried them on as well and my son said they were blurry as well and my daughter just thought they were neat and that I would give them to her if she didn't have a problem.  I was really excited about these, but I got them so I could see underwater so that defeats the purpose.  I had notice that there were some other goggles that had the similar designs that said they had the same issues so I am wondering if it has to do with just this type of shape or something else.  The other problem I had was when we were done swimming/testing them, we put them on the side of the pool and black silicone that made the seal next to the eye came off.  Now I could easily put it back on, but I was surprised that just by putting it down next to the pool it would come off.  My concern with that would be that if it would come off so easily that would end up being missed placed or lost especially when I was in a hurry.  I was hoping these would work, unfortunately, they didn't."
2.0,"The colors on this were so vibrant it looked cheap. Even my husband said, “eww”."
2.0,Bought these before a business trip to Asia.  Initially I loved these socks.  They fit nicely and seemed to be well made.  Unfortunately after only the second time wearing them one of the seams ripped.  And after the third time wearing them the other seam ripped (all within the course of 3 weeks). If the quality issues could be fixed these socks would be awesome.
2.0,Cute but off fit. The breast area just doesn't sit right. I tried to modify with. Needle and thread and by bending the underwire. It helped but is still weird so I just gave up and don't wear it. May be better for small chested women. I am between a C and a D cup and it just didn't work.
2.0,It is beautiful however it is too big it falls down of my waist.
2.0,I returned product. Material was flimsy on the top.  No support.
2.0,I Use this size chart provided and was still too big other than that durability is good
2.0,Mediums are huge!
2.0,Does not work well. The rubber does no fit securely on the watch posts.
2.0,This shirt is not the same material as the photo at all.  Not distressed.  Looks like a t shirt.  Returning.
2.0,"I was so excited when I got this band and the clasp snapped right in! However, after about a week, I noticed that one clasp would just slide out without even noticing. I looked down at my wrist and my watch was gone. Thankfully I found my watch, untouched outside on the ground, but save yourself the time and money and don't order these bands"
2.0,"In know its their ""sensory"" line, but seriously. Sensory kids like quality too. IT comes out of the dryer all wrinkly. Not what I come to expect from City Threads.  For the money, not worth it."
2.0,This too I cannot get a return response. Adorable dress. I purchased two thinking one should fit my niece but no luck. I order several style shoes and dresses for my sister and her daughter to try. She has MS and cannot shop. Now I'm stuck with returns because I can't figure out where to send them back.
2.0,ng
2.0,I opened the box they were in And pulled out the plastic bag they were all in and some of them were broken with confetti at the bottom of the bag
2.0,Was really excited about this necklace... but even more disappointed that the areas of the panda that were supposed to be black were not black and the rest that was black is wearing off
2.0,looked a little cheap
2.0,These would not stay on my husband’s ears.
2.0,"I was really hoping for these to work out but they would not stay on my daughters foot.  The fit was as to be expected but as soon as she would start walking, the back would come up and then she would step on it as she stepped back down.  I had to return them because of this."
2.0,"Inconsistent sizing.  I had another set prior to this that fit great.  These latest we're an inch and a half too short, and won't work."
2.0,"The dress does not look like the picture. The neckline is not that high, looks more like a tank top. Still a pretty dress, but with a lower neckline and a high seam under the breast, it’s not as flattering as the model pictured and I got the right size. I’m 5’6” 1/2 and 145 and I got a M."
2.0,"This watch is fine, until you attempt to put it on your wrist. The band is WAY too small. Buying a new and larger band will cost nearly as much as a new watch. Casio, bad decision you made about the watch band."
2.0,It’s comfortable but too open on the sides
2.0,They were supposed to be for high impact but the padding wasn’t attached to the sports bra but an insert. It doesn’t provide the support needed for larger busted women.
2.0,"The glasses are nice,, but as being oversized? I'm a bigger guy. Bigger than the normal by a large tee shirt guy,,<br />I usually buy extra large tees tall sizes, so when buying sunglasses i like to get the wider bigger lenses than the normal ones you can pick up in any store. And that's what these are , the normal ones. They are very nice for the price, but oversized, i think not."
2.0,"These are really cute! But sadly the stones fall off really easily. Within 2 weeks, most were gone."
2.0,"Skirt was cute but the waistband was way too tight and not stretchy at all. Sadly, it was returned."
2.0,"I'm editing my original review and lowering my star count out of frustration.  The product works, but the size chart is so off that ordering a second vest that was two sizes up - it was still too small.  I asked them to fix their size chart.  Also, there is no heat in the chest, neck or upper back.  The description does not say heat in these areas, this is just for your information - I will look for a different vest that will hopefully fit my husband.  First review:  We followed the size chart measurements and the XL should have fit but it was too small.  My husband's chest is 46"", waist 41"" 41.6"" and he's 205 lbs - but the XL was way too small by at least 2 inches - could not touch zipper together.  We reaordered a XXL, hopefully that would be better - I think the XXXL would be too big.  The vest seems well made, we did not plug it in to check if it worked."
2.0,"Overall too small; my face size from nose ridge to chin is 6.5”. If I pulled it up to nose then it sits weird on the chin.  Now, it’s uncomfortable."
2.0,Looked best with a crinoline to fluff out the skirt.  Unfortunately the zipper broke on the first wearing.  SIGH.
2.0,"I bought this kit because of a prime day special. I wasn’t sure where my lobes were at because I took out my 0 gauge years ago and let them close. I like the kit but the threads on the back are jacked. They don’t screw closed all the way, and I’m constantly checking them because they come loose very easily. I thought it was just one pair but the further I stretch the more I notice it keeps happening. That is what happens when you go the cheap route I guess."
2.0,I wish this was longer. I love the color and the ruffle but it was just too short to be practical
2.0,Wouldn't recommend if you plan to wear it in water. Water got underneath the screen after 2 weeks
2.0,Poor quality. Just tied strings
2.0,It not the quality I thought it would be
2.0,These don’t stay up on your face very well.
2.0,Thin fabric - but not really breathable. Nice design though
2.0,"Not very good socks, they slid off my feet and were too thick."
2.0,"When the necklace arrived, several of the beads had come loose in shipping.  It was fairly easy to reattach them because the WIRE (not rings or other jewelry findings/hardware) used to attach the beads was so light gauge.  I have Christmas tree ornament hooks that are heavier gauge wire.  Additionally, the chain links that comprise the &#34;skeleton&#34; of the necklace are not well formed (the ends do not all meet as they should).  The picture I've attached shows both issues.  I'm almost afraid to wear it for fear I'll lose beads if I do.  Like another reviewer, I also had to add a necklace extender so that it wasn't too tight.<br />I would not recommend this because I fear I may only get one wear out of it and not get my money's worth, even at this price point.<br /><br />Follow up:  I wore the necklace to work today and came home to find a bead on the counter.  Apparently, it fell off before I could even get out of the house and my husband found it on his way out."
2.0,The product itself is great and met expectations. However delivery missed the guaranteed window which defeated the purpose of this purchase which was for a Halloween costume.
2.0,"It's wearable, but I'm never going to. It's borderline a toga. Like, if I could explain it I'd say it looks and feels like the kind of dress a person learning to sew would make. I'm just really not into it...I would say you get what you pay for but I bought another dress at the same price and it was way nicer."
2.0,Broke when shipped
2.0,It’s a cute set but the bottoms are completely see through! I was so happy I caught this before the party I attended. The fit was a little bigger than expected too.
2.0,It's a cheap looking material and the neck line is too high. It doesn't look like the picture.
2.0,The tops kept falling out. But the bar was short enough and it wasn’t uncomfortable.
2.0,"The description states they are progressive readers.  The seller also includes a detailed map of the progressive lens cut.  Great marketing but these are old school bifocals, you know the type your grandfather wore.  The glasses are OK and function well as readers but the seller needs to revise the description of these readers."
2.0,The drawstring closure is poorly designed and these are impossible to cinch. After a few minutes of movement they are falling down. After a several wears the material around the holes for the drawstring ripped.
2.0,"Quite low quality, this shirt arrived heavily mint with colorful spot on the front. Washing didn’t help. Too expensive for this kind of product."
2.0,"Received these very bent out of shape.  It took some doing, but I managed to make them work.  It would be tough to want to buy them again."
2.0,"Similar to another post, the glue that was used in these frames ends up seeping out and staining the lens. I literally can no longer see out of these glasses. Please note that it took a few months for this defect to show up, so some of the positive posts that were listed during first few days of ownership may not reflect the long term quality of this product. After wearing them and being fairly pleased for a few months, I noticed that in hot weather there appeared to be a small stain on the one lens. Since they are sunglass, they continued exposure to the sun and the heat therefore resulted in the stain growing to the point where both lens have been compromised. I can't tell wether the stain is from glue used around the nose piece or wether it's something that they apply to the lens for color, etc that ends up defecting the lens.<br /><br />At any rate, I cannot recommend this product and consider it another cheaply made product where the seller most likely profits from people not wanting to take the time to fight them to return the product after owning them for a few months."
2.0,"They float, the pattern looks good. HOWEVER, due to the way they are packaged they come creased. I’ve tried ironing them. Soaking them in water and they still look awful because of the fold in them that won’t come out."
2.0,The toe is very wide and can be uncomfortable in shoes.
2.0,These lasted a fraction of the life that similar priced socks did.
2.0,Fit oddly. Not impressed.
2.0,Dress is super thin. Very see through.  Feels like I was wearing pajamas so I returned it.
2.0,"This dress squeezes my neck and arms like it wants them to separate from my body. It zips without issue, but the top is like 2 sizes too small. It is hard to explain. The dress feels great if I am standing still, the moment I move my arms or neck it cuts me. WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?! It even haves gaps in the fabric when standing still, like room to move. I normally wear a Medium or 8 in dresses, but that is NOT the case for this one. The dress is very cute and I love the print, but I can't breathe while wearing it."
2.0,"Too thin, ripped after about 20 feet"
2.0,I ordered a size up but it was still to tight and in the wrong places. It was such a strange cut. The shirt was much smaller than the bottoms. Maybe we got a pajama incorrectly sized? Not sure but it was labeled 4t and was off. Disappointed. Was a cute pajama but I don't want to waste my time ordering from them again.
2.0,The grey shorts part of seem was not fully sewn up
2.0,The picture is a plastic iron on. Let's see how long it holds up
2.0,"The elastic band in this dress made the dress fit awkwardly on me. I returned the dress because of this. The material was soft and I loved the color, but I just didn’t love how it fit."
2.0,sleeves were too short and fit weird
2.0,Disappointed!  I just received the 4 bracelets I ordered for my sisters based on the online picture and reviews and was very disappointed that the writing is hard to see. Nothing like on amazon. The writing is small and silver like the bracelet not black as seen on amazon. Did I get a bad batch. All the customers pictures looks very legible!  I needed this for our get together this weekend and now not sure I want to give these to them!  My pictures look better than in person. I have to set it down on something to read it. Hard to see on the wrist or just holding it.  Are my expectations to high?
2.0,The ears definitely aren't as perky/stiff as in the photo....I was very disappointing when i tried it on the first time the night I was wearing my halloween costume and was stuck with it. I thought it made me look more like a bear than a dog....they arent as long as the photo too.
2.0,"Beautiful color, but fabric felt very cheap. Returned."
2.0,"The pant is stretchy, has a place to keep a phone (pockets are a plus when working out). However, I found that these just didn’t fit as properly as any of my other workout pants and I own a lot of them. I couldn’t do a squat or bend over as they hung down and would lower several inches in the crotch area."
2.0,"Although I chose to keep this, I'm not crazy about the gold tone of the metal; it's too bright and I can't wear it with other gold bracelets. I realize that it's not expensive, but I've got a lot of ""gold"" costume jewelry that looks better. Oh well."
2.0,"Like most clothes made in China, they are just not true to size for American women.  Cute pants but going back because too small in the but and stomach area.  The leg of the pant fits fine but not the mid section."
2.0,The fit was perfect but the stripes were uneven from being hemmed wonky.
2.0,It's a little low cut from what I was expecting and not because it's cut that way but because the straps are too long- which results in the armpit holes being really low too. It's a weird fit. I wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"I bought this maxi dress for my daughter. She’s 5’2 with a small waistline and a small to medium frame (small tops/medium bottoms). I read the reviews about being true to size, so I ordered a medium...it fit like an extra large on her. The seam that circled the dress was lower on the dress we received than on the model in the picture. It did not hug the top of the body like in the picture. It was a straight up & down dress. It looked like a robe. I gave it 2 stars because the length and color was perfect but the fit was off. Order a size or two down."
2.0,"Run small. I am a size 7 women shoe, currently a bit swollen from pregnancy but was surprised when I literally could not get the small socks on on a good day. Much smaller and tighter than my other compression stockings."
2.0,"It came in early, but the entire right portion was cracked off, only held on by the band."
2.0,Stitching came undone after being worn once.
2.0,"Cute and looks better than the picture...before washing. I wore it once to a casual wedding and it was cute and I was very happy with it. However, after one wash the seams between the top black fabric and the bottom flowered fabric are coming apart. I was hoping to wear it to a bridal shower later this month but I may have to do some repairs or just buy something else. It's too bad because it really was nice and exceeded my initial expectations."
2.0,"The product is great, the seller maybe not so much. My daughter had her heart set on this Nerlie and the additional contents that should have been in the box. It was missing the birth certificate, I contacted the seller and still have not heard back. Product great, seller not so much."
2.0,I bought my normal size but these were way too tight and not like any I have bought before.
2.0,Lace is pretty but the cut makes me feel larger than I am. It’s ok.
2.0,Charms are nice but necklace of of them came knotted.  Not cool and cheap looking necklaces.  Charms like I said very nice
2.0,I love the design except the metal part of the scarf spread all over my clothes like glitter.
2.0,"Seemed light enough but it was too large and floppy for my head 7 1/2 .  Also , the strap adjusting the size  in the back was too flexible."
2.0,These seemed to be good at first but haven't had them very long and they are both cracked!
2.0,Very small and thin material! Not running socks.
2.0,daughter like it is it is not to tight - still it ripped with in the first 3 times of wearing
2.0,It ran small.  Ordered suit based on their measurements and it did not fit.
2.0,The color is darker than pictured. Dress stops shorter than described .Fabric is thin.
2.0,Much smaller than I thought
2.0,"These are undeniably the most comfortable leggings I've ever owned, and they're obviously a super great price. However, my black pair are absolutely see-through. I've had multiple people tell me the butt area is especially see through which is especially problematic for exercise and lifting--the activities I bought these for in the first place. I feel pretty embarrassed knowing I spent a couple weeks at the gym with see-through pants. Still going to wear them, but I really wouldn't recommend buying them to workout or wear out and about often!"
2.0,This dress did not look like the pictures.
2.0,They are slightly too large. It took some effort to get them in place.
2.0,It's nice but the rings all around it are overkill and kind of stupid.
2.0,"Like every right-thinking wearer of dresses, I love a dress with pockets. The pockets on this dress, though, make it ridiculously unflattering. They create volume around the hip area that, in essence, makes your butt look like it has wings you're attempting to conceal under a sack-like garment. That being said, it's a lovely color and a nice fabric. There were initial troubles with color fastness that (I hope!) I have resolved. But in general I think I'll wear this dress strictly for watching Netflix at home alone."
2.0,"My daughter has been wearing this shoe on and off (between snow boots, ballet slippers, and one other pair of shoes) for less than 2 months and the sole of the shoe is already starting to separate from the top of the shoe.  She loves the shoe because it's sophia, and Santa brought it...but Santa needs to pay a little more attention to the quality of work being done in his workshop.  Growing little girls should outwear their shoes before the shoe falls apart."
2.0,Not suitable for wearing long hours as the frame is very uncomfortable.
2.0,It's basically a bag. No part of it is fitted. The cut at the top does NOT match the picture.
2.0,"looks plasticky and cheap.  I like the idea and design of it, but when it arrived, it literally looks like colorful plastic tabs!! If the plastic were a different more durable looking material, then you could play it off as an adult woman, otherwise it looks rather juvenile and something for a tween to wear. i love costume jewelry and other pieces by this vendor, but this one is a no go for me."
2.0,Returned my item due to White stripes being blue. Like a color transfer.
2.0,These are much cuter in the online pictures. Fabric is not soft and pants fit weird.
2.0,Cheap busted the 2nd day
2.0,When we received our robes we were very happy. We purchased four for guests to use. We washed them and guests used them after taking a dip in our hot tub. We washed again after company left and I noticed a tear in the one seam. They were wore for approximately 10 minutes to the hot tub and to the bathroom to change. The quality is lacking. They continue to fall apart with each use.
2.0,"I wear a 30 around the waist, and when this underwear came in it already ran a little too tight. After the first (and only) wash, I tried them on and it was way too tight. I would recommend going one maybe two sizes larger than what you’re used to."
2.0,"I'm a 32D and ordered this in a Small, per size chart recommendation. The band is so big (and therefore unsupportive) that it rides up my back. But the cup is so small that I've got armpit flesh blooming out the sides.<br /><br />Who, exactly, is this made for? Not anyone with a large enough cup to actually need the support of a thick sports bra, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Instead, I recommend Hanes Sports Racerback Seamless bra (which I also purchased in Small), a.k.a. Hanes Jogbra. They're not pretty, but they fit like a dream, are dirt cheap on Amazon, and have supported my girls through some looong runs."
2.0,Shrinks a lot. Buy 2 sizes bigger!
2.0,"the picture us deceiving, its much smaller and much shorter than it appears.  i thought it would be long, its short and tight"
2.0,The dress was well made and overall fit my wife but the lace on the back was too lose so it didnt sit right.
2.0,"Love this shoe and ordered it approx. 2 years ago from the same vendor.  After just a few wears, my left foot twisted when I stepped on a small rock and the thong broke approx. ¼ inch beneath the foot bed.  Shoe repair shop advised it cannot be repaired and should be returned to the mfg because of the flimsiness of the thong.  Still have the shoes and would order the 9N again to have a pair and a spare but won’t since my original purchase was at a much lower price.  Still this vendor delivers great service."
2.0,I have purchased multiple pairs of boys sandals and had to return them because they fit like snowshoes! These sandals by olukia are the opposite. The sandal was so narrow you couldn’t see it when worn.
2.0,"nice belt, but scratches away very easily"
2.0,If your looking for something that will cover your butt this won't do it.Fit like a tank top its very short
2.0,did not work for me.
2.0,"Fit snug in the crotch region, slight wedgie issues.."
2.0,This product is not for tummy control. It constantly folds over.
2.0,"These are beautiful to look at but horrible to wear. I have average calves but skinny and not fat, these jeans were so very tight on them they were uncomfortable. Now, the waist and body part is huge in comparison,  there's no way anyone is built with stick person legs and a HUGE torso. Such a waste . Thank goodness for easy returns. I bought these twice hoping that it was a fluke, nope just made all wrong."
2.0,Son loves it but the strap clip in pieces broke the first time I tried to attach it to the helmet.  This seems like a common problem.  Don't buy!
2.0,"Nice cut, but material makes it look cheap."
2.0,"Disappointed in my purchase... tried not to get my hopes up considering the cheaper price of these gloves, but they didn't even last 2 months (and i only wore them a few times) before the stitching started to come undone and they completely fell apart... and the return window closed so i cant get a replacement or refund. Your money would be better spent elsewhere"
2.0,"The color is nothing like its shown. The color looks more lime green than olive. The pattern was botched! I had high expectations and was very disappointed! The tag was sown on the outside of the dress at the back of the leg, and the stitch is so bad i was worried about removing it in fear of it making a big hole. I gave 2 stars because its a dress to throw on...but nothing fancy"
2.0,I bought predicated on cotton content. When viewed before purchase was majority cotton. On receipt label indicates majority polyester with 1/2 of that for cotton.<br />Very disappointing. Fabric feels nice but won’t breathe as cotton would. Haven’t washed or worn.
2.0,They were really cute. Better then I expected. But I only wore them once and when I took them off I noticed the back of my ears itching. After looking I realized I had a rash. Idk if something was on them or if it was something they are made of but I wore them on Thursday (the day I got them) and I still have a very itchy rash.
2.0,"At best, these are ankles warmers as that is the only place they stayed put.  It was a constant battle all day to get them to stay up."
2.0,"Love this top! Having a large bust and small waist, I usually wear tops with a waist belt to make sure my flowy tops don't just billow like a bag on me, and this top is perfect without a belt! I was concerned with sizing after reading reviews, but I just went with my typical dress size (6) and it fits beautifully. May be a little low for some, but it's the perfect amount of sexy to pair with a cute bralette. The fabric is classy enough to dress up and casual enough for everyday wear. Super light and soft to the touch, almost like a thin brushed suede feel mixed with a silky feel and super flowy and light. Haven't worn it yet, but hoping the tie stays put throughout the day.<br /><br />For size reference, I'm 5'5, 34DD, 132lbs, with a pear shape build. The 6 fits perfectly. Buying it in more colors!<br /><br />UPDATE: I ordered another in gray and the item is awful in color and quality. It is a pearly lavendar color, not gray and it sewn differently than the green one and the fabric is cheap and shiny. It's one of those China knock-off type companies. Super irritated."
2.0,Its somewhat small but the hat is lovely !!!
2.0,Too big and IPhone 7 doesn't fit neatly
2.0,I ordered a white dress and it looked more like a light lilac color. It also came inside out and had a black stain on the bottom hem. I took pics to compare white pants next to the dress but it's hard to see in the pic but definitely did not meet my expectations so I'm returning it.
2.0,"I run as an XL typically though sometimes XL is even big; ordered an XXL and this feels like a medium... There is 0 room in the shoulder area, stomach seems fine, but it is also extremely short. I have other &#34;fitted&#34; shirts, so it is not the cut, it's the make/design of this."
2.0,"I was really excited for this but was disappointed with what arrived.<br />It's definitely soft and lightweight - that part of the description is spot on.<br />The color is labelled as Steel Blue and what arrived was actually more of a teal/darker green. Personally, I like the color quite a lot but it definitely isn't any kind of blue.<br />What really lost this scarf points though is the poor printing of the fox design. Some of the foxes are elongated and strange looking (see photo - the one on the right is misprinted, the one on the left is fine) and the dye is smudged the whole way down the scarf through all the elongated foxes. The print would be so adorably cute if it was done well.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I will only order discounted/free items to review that myself or my family will actually use."
2.0,I don't like the granny look.  The silicone straps that attach to the end of the earpieces look so much better and you don't know they are there.
2.0,I cannot affix the straps unless I have the earhooks and they only come with 1 earhook?<br />would be great if someone could tell me how to use this product with out earhooks
2.0,Black stones had fallen off before I even opened it.
2.0,I've got a bunch of the Vidda pro pants and love them. I was hoping that these would be something similar but in a light summer fabric. Er..... Not exactly. These are pretty ugly and fit weird. They are SUPER long too even for the regular. I don't care for the built in belt either but that is a personal thing. I like to wear my own belt and be able to hang things from it if I want.
2.0,"This item came from China, but never said that’s where it was ordered from until it shipped. Customers should know in advance where the items will be coming from before purchasing. Took over 2 weeks to arrive and it was way too small. Won’t order cloths from Amazon again"
2.0,Item was still small I even compared size charts to stores that I frequently shopped at and the item was still too small. I was planning on using this shirt for my fiance's Golden birthday. He his 6'3 and normally wears a 2-4x depending on the brand. I compared this one to the Ralph Lauren polo shirts and button downs and decided to go with the 7x (5-3 sizes bigger that what I normally get him) and it doesn't fit. It is so short and barely buttons. I am very dissapointed because I was so excited for this shirt. It also came with a red stain in it near one of the buttons (I hope it's not blood). Over all the shirt looks as pictured but it runs was smaller that described.
2.0,I bought the gold key ring and after a couple of months the color faded and it started to become hard to open/close. Won’t buy again.
2.0,Don't buy this dress if you actually expect it to be floor length. I'm only 5'2&#34; but the size small (which otherwise fit me well) hits about 3 inches above my ankle--a super awkward length! My sister also bought the same dress in a large and hers is also too short. So it wasn't just a fluke.
2.0,Didn't survive my four year old.
2.0,Way too small.  Way too thick.  Returned.
2.0,"The khaki bolero was too small and sort of a funny shape.  I ordered the same size in blue and it fits much better.  It is also more of an olive green grey than a tan.  I returned it for the reason that it did not fit, but will not be ordering it in the next size up, though I am keeping the blue one."
2.0,It’s only for the words or looks. Doesn’t keep you warm and came in SO small. My daughter wanted a 3x for extra room and it doesn’t even have a tag on it to tell you the size. It’s crazy small on her but she loves it.
2.0,"For this bathing suit to work, you need to have an A-cup breast. So many wardrobe malfunctions. Bottoms are cute though so may just get a bigger top to match them."
2.0,quality not on par with cost.
2.0,"Not true to size, it's much bigger. And the red came looking like pink. Will be returning."
2.0,"These are very cheap. Attempting to adjust one of the hooks, it popped right off."
2.0,This is a very hot mask to breathe into
2.0,"I Have not opened all the merchandise.  I was a little surprised that there was no Mfg. Content Label, as most goods have. Most fabric goods sold in the U.S. must contain a "" Content Label "" Type of material, Size( American Sizing or International ) and it is true, that I didn't see Reg.Or Slim and Tall  sizing when I ordered. Also, I did not see that the product name. I will admit that I did not see the shirt was not button element was not top to bottom.Generally a name ( example--"" Polo "". I am going to return the merchandise."
2.0,Not even close to accurate size even allowing for dif size chart. See-thru as well. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this hat. I love the material and color. However, it is strange...it's crooked in the front (bill is off) and the sides just Iver the ear sit too high up. Often hats come way to far down almost covering the ear, but this one seems to be cut really high. Also, the point tail hole is super high as well. Bummed overall."
2.0,The fit was a little snug for my body type (5'5&#34;) and the length was too short.
2.0,"Would not buy these again.  After a couple of days, they were like walking on thin flat cardboard.  I still wore them for a couple of months since I bought them and didn't want to spend more money on slippers.  Now I'm willing to pay more money for better slippers.  Giving two stars since I was able to wear them for a couple of months but I definitely won't recommend these.  They got sooooo flat."
2.0,Ordered a medium and fits like a large!
2.0,"It's a nice hat but it didn't even come close to fitting.  I gave it to a friend.  If you normally wear a small/medium, look elsewhere."
2.0,Very thin material and super stiff
2.0,The bottom half of the dress was made differently.
2.0,I bought this as a surprise for my 3 yr old daughter because she likes Elsa so much but it's way too big for even me and my wife let alone for my kids.
2.0,Too small. Had to give to my daughter
2.0,Functional.. Not fancy. Just as expected
2.0,"It is a nice hat, but way too big. It definitely does not look good when it is that big. My advice to the seller: if it is primarily women buying this hat, you might want to get a smaller size."
2.0,"Scratchy and cheap material Would have been great if made from a better Material.  looks nice in picture, but felt it was low quality."
2.0,"Not nearly as long as pictured, but still really pretty. There was a small tear in one of the seams."
2.0,The metal end of one lace broke off during the first day of use
2.0,"It's a very narrow item.  Might fit a child better.  But it's also very tall, so there is ZERO chance of seeing the graphic on a human user.  Would be perfect for aliens or giraffe."
2.0,It’s a little snug and I have trouble getting out of it for that reason
2.0,This product is okay. It is a little more on the shear side but is fine for a one time use. Will not buy again however..
2.0,Fits ok. Seems like it might last a while. But the material pills up like crazy.
2.0,Disappointed I got different sizes
2.0,A little too flashy
2.0,"This top is super cute, but all of the buttons crumbled in the washer the first time I laundered it. Washed on gentle in cold water and hung to dry...<br /><br />This is def not a swim cover, as it doesn’t cover any of the sensitive bits, but it looks super cute with jeans or cutoffs"
2.0,It was a beautiful shirt just a tad too tight did not sit fully as expected
2.0,"Had I not removed the tags, I would return the shorts.  They are now in the Goodwill bag."
2.0,One of the nose pieces was missing.
2.0,"Side seam under arm is so rough! It seriously HURTS! Other than that the bra is great, super cute gives a good shape, definitely order a bigger cup size than normal. Idk maybe it’s just me, but I did so much research on bras for bustier women and found this type which yeah the type is great but the fit is small and it feels like an underwire stabbing you in the pits but it’s NOT even the underwire, it’s a side wire and the wire isn’t even showing! I thought maybe after a wash it would possibly soften it where it wouldn’t hurt so bad but no doesn’t help at all :( Also the extra strap from the lace overlay is SO ITCHY! :’( I just wanted a cute comfortable bra for my big boobs :("
2.0,"I included two photos- the PINK onesie is 24 months. The GRAY tunic and BLACK tights are what I purchased (1-2T) it is very small. Nothing 2T about it.<br /><br />The second photo is a side by side so you can see the PINK 24 month onesie and the GRAY/BLACK outfit 1-2T.<br /><br />The bottoms are also just tights- I thought they were pants. Don’t want someone else to be confused by that too. It is just footed pantyhose/tights. Not leggings. If this fit, it would be too short for a “tunic dress” more like a shirt and you would need different bottoms since they are see through."
2.0,Wish it could have been used.
2.0,I felt disappointed about the product.
2.0,Too big for my wrist.
2.0,"Size up, it was tight in the bust, but also very low cut. Length is good, and I love the pockets (one had a hole in it though). I’m not a huge fan of the fabric, but it is thick and not see through."
2.0,"I bought a large based on the size specifications and was practically swimming in it! It ended up costing me more than twice as much as the cost of the dress to get it altered for a party. Quality is good, but the sizes....need work."
2.0,I'm a little disappointed..i ordered magenta and received plum. I wanted the magenta to match with my shoes..too much trouble sending it back
2.0,Very comfortable but length is short. I wear a large and with this if I raise my hands up my stomach is showing. Order a size up.
2.0,"It was a pretty dress, but the cut is for a curvy woman. Very loose in the waist and hips. Not cute if your figure is more straight like mine."
2.0,"Not as long as described or pictured. It seems they just make them wider instead of longer also with a bigger size, I ordered a large. Also, it is very sheer so I would have to wear a shirt underneath."
2.0,very hard to get cards etc in and out of
2.0,They are way to big for my feet.
2.0,Size is smaller than stated. Stitching is bad and unraveled out if package.
2.0,"These are not “junior” size, but toddler size. They are barely large enough for my 7 yr old grandson. Disappointing!"
2.0,I normally wear a 2x and I ordered a 4x and could not get it over my head
2.0,Was way too small so i gave it to my neighbor.
2.0,"Not as I expected, these sliders are thin compared to others I have found. May not be able to use them. The finish is gorgeous  though."
2.0,The shoe does not have enough arch support for a toddler.
2.0,"The material was very thin, needed irioning and had a slight pull in it. The untucked shirt was long, so it needs to be tucked."
2.0,Although print is pretty it is totally see thru
2.0,fell apart fast
2.0,Its not soft at All.<br />It fits a lil big.<br />Theres No pockets and it doesnt have tie string.<br />Wow 35$ for this Never again.
2.0,"It broke after a week, and I didn't wear it everyday!"
2.0,Very cute but the first one has a hole under the arm after wearing it once so we returned it and the second one has a hole in the pocket and hasn’t even been worn yet. Very disappointed.
2.0,"The top is big, if you wear a camisole or something under it it can pass, but if not you might flash someone."
2.0,"Fit my butt fine, but gaped in the front. Not enough coverage for my boobs, but simultaneously too big of a band size. To their credit, my under-bust measurement is only 30-31 in, but I'm a dd. So that's a hard thing to accommodate. I was really sad I couldn't wear it though bc it was reallllllyyyyyyy cute."
2.0,The blue dye from the hoodie ruined everything else I had on including discoloring my hands. By the end of the day I that there of a Smurf :( ... Fit comfy though.
2.0,"Below average quality. Just feels and looks cheap, but you get what you pay for. It was way too big for me and not soft/flowy as the photo suggests. Donated it."
2.0,"Lost big stone she said stone was loose when she got it  ,I thought I had it fixed but didn't"
2.0,"These are rather thin, which is fine, but my complaint is that the elastic at the top was very tight and made it look like I had like...thigh muffin top? Is that a thing? Like, I'm no twig, I'm a size 6, though, and it seems a bit absurd that these over the knee stockings actually wouldn't quite work above the knee. If you have super thin legs or plan on wearing these like right on your knees, though, I guess they'd be fine."
2.0,Material is a bit flimsy. The fit is small.
2.0,"When I first tried to put on the watch, the strap didn’t fit into the first loop. However, it did fit into the second one, so I was able to wear it. However, it stopped working after less than 2 months.  I’m not even going to bother trying to get a new battery installed since I saw someone else mentioned that didn’t help in a previous review. I don’t recommend this watch."
2.0,"Looks OK until you try it on. Fits all boxy.  In photo looks like a tshirt made of cotton. It's a stretchy material. I'm disappointed ,looked so cute. Not what I was expecting."
2.0,"Did not feel right, should have gotten smaller cup"
2.0,Shirt looks as advertised but the shirt quality is poor and the iron on is a solid piece of plastic
2.0,The center sticker falls out.
2.0,Was not thick enough and would stay up on your face
2.0,"These are as soft as LuLaRoe pants, but don't fit as well. . I'm 5'7 and they are not as long as I like my pants to be. . So a good fit if you have shorter legs maybe."
2.0,Material was a little thicker and not as soft as I had expected. Large was too small. Had to return.
2.0,"This is a cute bracelet, but looks kind of cheap, nice concept though."
2.0,"The fit is unbelievably small. A  friend who usually fits in size small, fit into an extra-large !"
2.0,"Ordered this skirt in size 8 which was the smallest available. I normally wear size 4 in dresses, pants, etc., but usually order a 6 or 8 in swimwear. Also, it was suggested to order 1 size up. The skirt was way too large for me and unattractive in appearance, perhaps because it was so loose on me. It is a very good length and I was disappointed that it did not fit.  Also, the elastic in the waist is too narrow for the casing causing the waistband to twist when taking on or off and difficult to keep the waistband flat.  I had a similar problem with a skirt recently and my seamstress simply sewed a stitch all around to secure it. That might be a suggestion to others who order this skirt.  I looked everywhere online for a 6 but no one had less than 8 so perhaps it is not even made in a 6."
2.0,"Cozy hat, keeps my head warm. Was expecting the cross to be a patch though, instead is just a little piece of cloth stitched on at two sides."
2.0,This is NOT a Sunnow shirt. I just saw that it wasn't as i was putting it on for work. It is a 2x but it fits smaller because its from a different company. Sometimes it msy say the same size but it'll be cut smaller or bigger. This one is definitely cut smaller. I have no choice but to wear it because I do not have another.
2.0,"I am so disappointed in these earrings...They are about 1/4 the size of the ones in the picture and they don't even have the same look. They resemble two square pieces of concrete with the middle cut out. It describes them as being handmade out of eco friendly materials; zinc alloy, whatever that is-some kind of mixed metal I would guess, which may be alright, I'm not a metal expert.  And they are supposed to be lightweight but they are heavy and not in a high end sort of way. They're heavy like concrete as I said before...It also says that they are turquoise but their is no turquoise in them, at all. I haven't even tried these on, I'm scared to death they'll fry my ears even though they say there's no nickel or lead. They were described as being large and they are about the size of a nickel, at best. So I don't trust a word they have said about these earrings. They aren't shiny, again, a dull concrete color with some charcoal specks, very ugly. They have the fish hook backing.  Since they were only $10 I'm chalking up to a lesson well learned, won't bother returning, but won't buy from brand or seller again. Two stars are for timely Prime delivery. Oh and they  also said they would be delivered in a box with a little bag for gifting and protected packaging-they were in a clear plastic wrapper. SMH...<br />UPDATE:  So I returned them after all, with no issues. I simply printed out the label, packaged it, and UPS picked it up on my doorstep. The return to my credit card will show up within 72 hours of receipt. Good riddance."
2.0,Disappointing.  It looked cheap; i ended up remaking it.
2.0,"It doesn't match the picture .. the hours marks inside the dial is silver color not black which looks tachy .. and the bracelet is stiff not as flexable as i thought.<br /><br />Hiwever, It is very light and have a lot of room to adjust to your liking<br /><br />Overall it's over-priced for the quality delivered .. look around first."
2.0,This dress is really cute but the one I received was defective. The left side had a really weird extra bit of fabric that made a strange pocket The best way I can describe it would be if I had an elephant trunk hanging from my boob it would be the perfect pouch. The front had no twist either. I think it was just made wrong. Too bad. It fit me well...other than the trunk pouch. Will be returning.
2.0,The pink color was great and fabrick good but was too tight for my 5’2” 120 lb frame. Not comfortable.
2.0,slide off your feet as you walk. Too soft and slippery
2.0,I was so excited when I received this bathing suit.  It was exactly as  pictured. Absolutely loved the colors until I tried it on.  It did not fit .. as far as the torso. Im 5'6 150 and ordered large. Was so disappointed.  Looked into one size up and the extra large shows same measurements for torso as the large. Gave it to a friend who is smaller in stature than myself and it did not fit her torso as well. Very unfortunate because the suit was super cute.
2.0,Pretty cheaply made. No colors at all. Only black and white. Totally taking advantage of being a Super Bowl product.
2.0,Don't waste your money. I bought this for a belly dance show and it broke in my first set.
2.0,Slightly different to product image provided here. Not the best quality.
2.0,"The dress is pretty. Make sure to note when buying, as it says in description, it is netting and not chiffon. I was aware but thought I'd give it a try but netting is not soft as described. It does run small, especially in the arms. Also, mine did not come with the ribbon for lacing up the back. Last, several beads were hanging. Read return policy and order with plenty of time to choose another option if yours doesn't come as expected in quality. Otherwise, it is pretty and enjoy."
2.0,Item does not match photo in description. The patch/logo is a different color then what I received. The photo in the listing shows the patch with a white background. The product I received it grey/Black
2.0,I'm 5'11 and this tank is past my waist.
2.0,"Served the purpose, however it was more of a polished finish. Reviews stated it was a matte finish, so a little disappointed"
2.0,"These look very cheap in person, obviously not fine jewelry. Also, the ear hooks were quite difficult to put on. Two stars for the cute style."
2.0,Poor thin material. Neck was huge on arrival. Do not recommend.
2.0,The mucklucs came in the wrong color and were too large.
2.0,"Sad to say, poor quality. Lens pops out, scratches eaasily."
2.0,Really really stiff (it crackles even).
2.0,Nice ring at a very low price. I was disgusted about the shipping.. I payed more on shipping than the ring.
2.0,chain too small not for adults maybe small child
2.0,Went wear black on and won’t snap
2.0,Super see through! Did not expect that from the other pictures and reviews. Maybe I got a dud I don’t know but not very happy with it
2.0,"The product listing stated &#34;Material: Sapphire and stainless steel&#34;, which lead me to believe the center strip was Saphire. It is not. It is just a groove in the metal that has been painted black. (see pic) For 12 bucks I did not expect quality but I did expect it to be correct. I feel a tie clip should take up 2/3rds of the tie when placed on. This one went across the entire tie when placed at about the third button on a standard size tie. That being said I listed it as &#34;Somewhat Large&#34; but it will work. The clasp easily shifts on its pivot so I look for it to break after some use. See pic. It did come with a nice little cloth bag for you to throw away. I personally would not buy it again."
2.0,"While I love the color, the fit is way off. I'm skinny but with a large ""chest"" area. I always wear size large. But this is too large. I'll keep it because it's not worth returning. If I order again, I will size down."
2.0,"This piece of jewelry appears larger when advertised.  When received, it was smaller in size, and did not look the same.  I am somewhat disappointed."
2.0,"Cheap, easy to tangle and pendants bigger than pic"
2.0,Wow once buttons and braids are just glued on. Fell off
2.0,"This is super cute. My daughter is slim so the pants were so so big on her. Everywhere, the legs, waits and a little short. I had to return them."
2.0,One broke as we opened the package. They are very cute but you get what you pay for.
2.0,"The clip it is not secure, it opens, and does not keep tight.  It got lost because of not being able to be secure."
2.0,Love the dress but very large in the arm area.  I had to use safety pins to close the gap.<br /><br />**Edited**<br />On the third wear the seams at the arms ripped.
2.0,"They really are so adorable, but they are one of the hardest things to put in your ears."
2.0,"Earrings are actually a nice weight and finish, even arrived well in advance of the scheduled delivery date.  Unfortunately they were damaged when I received them.  Unfixable.  Wasted money - at least they were inexpensive."
2.0,See through.  I'm even wearing nude underwear. You can even see the tag through the fabric. I purchased the neon yellow color.
2.0,After one wash it got holes in it.
2.0,"I wear a men's size 12.  After ordering a 2nd set, and trying these daily for several months, I've come to the conclusion these socks are too small for size 12.  They are comfy and I wanted to make them work, but they just don't.  I've also found that in both packages have socks that fit better than others, very odd.  No inside silicone heel strip either."
2.0,Great design. Would only fit a child.
2.0,"This bra is comfortable, I received the 3X and my typical size is 42D. It is mostly comfortable, but the armpits dip very low, the material is sheer so the pads are visible, and it gives me uni-boob effect. I would return this item if I hadn't received it as part of the Vine program"
2.0,Nice product but no instructions on adjusting band and tool is useless.  Found similar ones that came with a band adjust tool.  Would not buy again or recommend.
2.0,Like the skirt not the material
2.0,I ordered 4x because I wanted a longer dress.  This 4x is not even close to a 4x.  The dress is so short and the split is super high up.  I normally wear a 2x but I got a bigger size so it would have length.  No such luck with this dress.
2.0,This pin is very pretty but the clasp broke the first time I tried to us it.
2.0,"I like the look of the pin. However was very disappointed in the quality, the back clip which holds the pin in place, broke off the first day I wore it."
2.0,These were not two toned. Only gold
2.0,Thick fabric cheap at the same time. It cut and fit is pretty bad.
2.0,"This produce fits as expected and hits a few inches above the knee (I'm 5'9'', 300lbs, 3x). It's see-through and very wrinkled. I don't recommend this product. If you're looking for an easy classic, opt for a higher quality, wrinkle-free jersey than this. I may just tie dye mine since it's pretty useless as a white dress."
2.0,"Don't expect much from this product. I purchased it for a gift for my sister. I did not give it to her because of the poor quality. Anyway, the price should have been a clue."
2.0,Not a real flannel and it is about one size smaller than marked.
2.0,"These earrings are not pretty to me at all.  They actually look pretty hideous.  The length of the earrings and the leaf petals are wayyy bigger than I expected.  But apparently the other reviewer felt differently.  To each their own.  I am considering wearing them on Halloween, because I wouldn't re-gift them for anyone I know."
2.0,I ordered 2 shirts in an XL and ended up returning both because they were see-through. They would be ok if you wore a cami underneath but not really what I was hoping for.
2.0,"The bracelet is not what I expected. I was getting the bracelet to go with a black stoned sterling silver ring I have. The bracelet looks like costume jewelry, it is not something you would wear with a nice piece of jewelry. I have not returned it, because I hate going to the trouble of doing it."
2.0,The size was big and the length was really long. For me they do not live up to their reputation.
2.0,"This item was SUPER tiny, and the edges of the fake diamonds scratched my nose as  Iwas putting it in, my nose hole is higher than most and it was not curved enough for me to wea it. I really thought it was pretty though. had to return it."
2.0,"This costume was kind of bad. The overall costume was good i guess, but there was missing parts. Like the leg warmers<br />THE WIG. The wig was a complete mess. So frizzy and tangled. and I tried combing it but it didn’t work out. Ended up returning…just buy another costume. Don’t waste your time or money!!"
2.0,"Cheaply made. Very thin. Item description says &#34;wool&#34; but it is really FELT material. Definitely for light weather and not what I am needing.<br /> Also,I am 5foot3 130pounds and a large was too small.<br />Returning. Wouldn't be so bad at half the price with an accurate description."
2.0,"Very short, too small, sleeves and cuffs even tight on daughter who is 2 sizes smaller than myself."
2.0,"The necklace looks so much different to the picture... It was really thin, great for a child but not an adult."
2.0,however it is a nice Rosary  Will make a terrific gift for the bridal couple.
2.0,These were way too big. I think they were adult size. It didn't fit at all on my 6 yo or 10 yo boys. They need to advertise a better age range. They would most likely fit a teenager. The masks are good quality though so I give some stars for that.
2.0,"I bought two of these. One for each of my daughters. They loved them and were so cute on, but 1 broke after the second day of wearing it. It was disappointing to say the least"
2.0,"For some reason, using the 4.25 or even 4.50 did not work for me.  I have bought other brands and they worked without any problems."
2.0,Not long at all... you would think they would dangle mid ways down your neck... but nope. Well maybe if your ears were lower on your head lol
2.0,I ordered large but was too tight
2.0,This swimsuit has absolutely no gift to it it is very tight in the boob are pancake titties is not my thing so I sent it back.
2.0,Material is super thin and unforgiving.
2.0,"The elastic is wide, thick and sturdy enough to really keep a &#34;tuck.&#34;  However, the clips aren't up to the task.  The plastic &#34;grabbers&#34; in the clamps have ZERO grip.  None.  Nothing, which is not what I felt when it snapped loose and momentarily wrecked my baby-maker.  Some coating is needed, or teeth."
2.0,"Kind of disappointed, read all of the reviews and sized up to a 3x as I am a size 16. It absolutely fits my body but the arms were definitely not taken into consideration. They are so small! I'll try and get them to a seamstress because this is so cute!"
2.0,It was very thin and cheaply made.  The local magic shop carried a better quality hat for less money.
2.0,"This was somewhat larger than I anticipated and it feels and looks more like something you could wear in the house for bedtime. It is very flimsy. I bought it to wear with tights/leggings, but I will not be wearing this out of the house as it looks too &#34;nightgown-ish&#34;  I currently wear it with my pajama bottoms around the house."
2.0,"Too small around for my athletic 16 year old to wear, would fit a much thinner person."
2.0,"For working outside, I need something to cut down the glare where I can also hold up my phone or something with small print and read it.  I have normal bifocal safety glasses (for inside), and very nice polarized driving glasses with bifocals, so I was hoping to use these in the yard when I'm using tools.<br /><br />Unfortunately the bifocal section takes up almost half my field of view and I found myself constantly tilting my head to try and look over the magnifier section when trying to pick things up off the ground or just work with my hands.  Also the lenses on the two sides seem to have a central focal point wider or narrow than my vision as they seem to be out of alignment with each other in my view.  (Don't have that problem with any other pair I own.)<br /><br />Not really usable except in an emergency, or when I am primarily working with something up close in the sun."
2.0,I got the size based on the size chard provided and it was easily 1-2 sizes too small
2.0,Not good quality but what did I expect it wasn’t name brand. It feels like it’s made out of jeans or something really rough. If you like this product you better really like it. Or keep looking
2.0,too big needed 9-10 not 11-12
2.0,"The quality of the print was terrible. The suit also ran very small, and was not good quality material. Very disappointed."
2.0,"After one wash, the pants have shrunk so much that I would now call them capris.  I am obly 5’8’’.  Otherwise, they fit well and are comfortable."
2.0,They are very beautiful but did not come with backs (they are post style earrings) and I will have to reglue the post to the moon one as it had apparently came unglued in the package(?). Hoping they will work well after I fix and get some backings.
2.0,"Disappointed, it's more of a coral than red, thin and see through. Wanted for a Christmas outfit but not right color."
2.0,Way way way way too too small
2.0,"This order took over 3 weeks to arrive. The buttons are much smaller than I hoped, but they do look nice. 2 stars for extremely long delivery and size. Not worth the price."
2.0,"I had high hopes for this dress. Unfortunately it was too loose in some places and too tight in other places, so ordering a different size wouldn’t have helped. Also, I thought it was more of a regular striped pattern. Instead of looking striped, it looked more like paint streaks, not regular pattern stripes. It wasn’t the look I thought it would be and the material felt more like a swim cover up than a stand alone dress. I had to return it. They did refund right away so hey, worth a shot if you want to try it out."
2.0,Don’t look like picture
2.0,Color is more of a bricka d yellow color not mauve it is ok I like the fit I wil probably order a blue next time. I got a XXL I usually use a L or XL.
2.0,It's a tall fit. Not too wide. Fairly warm hoodie. The straps to tighten the built in facemask broke 5 mins upon wearing while boarding.
2.0,the rings are working well. but i bought these as much for the clip thats prominently featured in several product photos. my bad that i missed the tiny print that says its not included. 4 stars for the product but i'm subtracting 2 stars for the misleading ad photos and copy.
2.0,"They're a nice looking shoe, but the velcro strap broke after only 4 times being worn. These were a birthday gift to my grandson, I'm very disappointed."
2.0,"The photo looked so nice and I like tunics, but it looked awful on me. I'm curvy, and I usually order a size up because I like loose, and clothes to hang without clinging. This had no room for a decent bustline and the tail of the shirt tuck under my butt in back, instead of hanging straight. Extremely unflattering! Ordering a size up will not fix design flaws. The color was not as advertised either. I wanted burgundy/maroon, like the photo. Got dark red. Returned."
2.0,The lace has stretch but the fabric on the chest does not. Very unflattering. Do not buy if D cup or up unless you like the aesthetic of flattened breasts. The color was also far different in person
2.0,Not a flattering cut and usually things run smaller on me and this was really big.
2.0,"I love North Face products. Was looking to buy this grey North Face 1/4 zip with the low shirt style collar as shown in the picture. But I had never seen this low collar grey style from any other venders except the two here on Amazon. There wasn't  much of a description to go by, so I checked with The North Face company directly.  North Face stated they do NOT make this style of low collar concavo in new or old versions of any color...<br /><br />BOTT LINE: Earns 2 Stars for unknown origin."
2.0,This is a very attractive purse and appears to be sturdy. It seems to be well made and I like its classy look. I was really impressed by the positive reviews and upon receiving the purse I agree with them. I am giving this purse 2 stars because of the way in which it was packaged. The purse was placed in a box that was too small for it to fit properly and unfortunately was creased on 3 sides. It can't stand upright on its own (see photos). The creases look bad. I'm returning it.
2.0,The neck has a weird flap on the inside that slides up as you're wearing it. Not the fabric pictured and not nearly as flowy.
2.0,The puma socks fitted  a little too small
2.0,"My daughters foot keeps slipping out of it. Fits tight around the ankle with Velcro but the foot comes out of the gap between her ankle and the toe strap. Totally for looks and they fall off within minutes. They are in her size and there isn't much extra room. But, I'm hoping when her foot gets bigger they might stay on better(for probably a week before she grows out of them), but it just seems like a design flaw at this point."
2.0,"The fabric feels like a one-ply polyester material. There's no reinforced seams at the neck, so the neckline will be very susceptible to fraying. I had it on for five minutes and I could already feel that it's not going to last more than *maybe* two full wears. Very cheap. But the shirt was also very cheap, so I knew what I was getting into.<br /><br />Also, if you have petite shoulders, just know that it's a loose fit. If I weren't afraid to break the shirt faster, I'd just wear it as an off the shoulder top and call it a day."
2.0,must be made for asians.....
2.0,size chart was off
2.0,"It is very easy to lose your keys with so weak magnet,!!!!"
2.0,They should offer different sizes not just one.
2.0,"Graphic on shirt looks as expected however, I ordered an XL which should be a size 14 and they sent me a 7. The available sizes to choose from are Medium and X-Large"
2.0,After purchasing this item my credit card information was stolen
2.0,"If only I had hips...I'm not very hippy so they fall but maybe instead of xl I should have gotten a large but I have others that are large so maybe it's my no hippage and not these. They are very soft, you can't see through them bit I find myself pulling them up which is annoying. I work in these"
2.0,I request size Smal and lock like large and either it don't haven any tag for size . Don't you know never what size is
2.0,This runs VERY small. I got a medium. It appeared to be made for a small child. It's probably cute if you are child or little person.
2.0,"I though they were amber, the visibility is good but reading is not easy with them. Is not a total loss as I can still wear them but is just not what I expected (both in color and also the fact it seems a bit blur if you try to read with them)"
2.0,Did not hold up first time used them.
2.0,My son played with them for less than an hour and the finger bands broke off.
2.0,They could have laid the pattern on nicer it look like it was hand-sewn on
2.0,"It’s pretty but it also bunches up so it looks weird. Tried to return it, but in order to do so, it would have been triple what I paid for it. So I kept it ..."
2.0,I ordered a 16 G 12mm and received a 14mm. too long for my vertical labret piercing. it’s a nice piece of jewelry but i’m really frustrated I was sent the wrong size.
2.0,"I love that hat, but it is small on my 4 year old..so it looks ridiculous on me."
2.0,After one wash it looks horrible.
2.0,Returned sweaters because I didn’t like the fit (frumpy) or the material.
2.0,Unfortunately this dress looks like a cheap polyester moo moo and nothing like the picture.
2.0,"I purchased the Spikerking Women’s V-neck Beach Dress for myself but had to give it to my daughter because it was way too small. The product description says “One Size Fits All,” but that was not the case for my size 14 body. As for the garment itself, it was really cute. I live in Florida, so not only would be perfect for the beach and pool, it could be worn as a regular top. You would, however, maybe want to add a cami, at least during the day. The garment appeared to be well made, and the colors were very bright. I think my daughter will enjoy it.<br />Disclaimer - I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I do not work for this company, nor do I know the seller.

2.0,Shrinks - by 2 sizes - using cold water wash!
2.0,Love the glasses only down fall is the purple pair was a child's size and to small for my head
2.0,Very strange material- kinda like a scrub top? Fits tightly and I am super tiny! Tried to return and was offered a small refund and told to keep the shirt. Skip this!
2.0,Too wide and too thick for Red Wing 9017. I didn't try trimming so that they could be returned. I wouldn't recommend these unless you have a lot of room in your boot.
2.0,I thought these would be warm for the winter extremely thin not comfortable scratchy material
2.0,"It is kind of short for taller women and very thin. Need to wear a slip or something underneath for sure. The skit is SOOO HIGH I felt like I was going to flash everyone and I even used fashion tape to seal it quite a bit if I were to wear it out. Bought it to wear to a wedding but it is definitely not the style for the occasion. Got a better dress for the price, will be returning"
2.0,Been looking for a long time for the perfect sized frame. These are it. Large enough but not so large they look like costume. Love that there are 4 pairs because I lose them daily.  Update.....now 3 of the 4 pairs have lost their pin. Soooo disappointed. Although I didn’t lose them I only have 1 pair (just took them out of box) left. What a shame that the pins fall out.
2.0,"I thought it was really pretty, but the material is very itchy. It is very uncomfortable."
2.0,"I wanted to love these!  They fit well and they are super soft, but... the fabric is so thin it is see-through.  I ordered the light grey."
2.0,"Returned, not a good fit in fingers and fingers also go very cold."
2.0,Dress was too large.
2.0,"Waited about 3 weeks for this to come in from China. After removing just one link, the watch looks and feels very good on the wrist. The bezel is probably 60 clicks, unidirectional with minor back give, but turns easily. The crown does not screw in so I have not tried to get it wet. Pulling the crown out to set the time is difficult almost as if there was something wedged in the crown stem. I think you can also wind using the crown, but  it feels like there's resistance, almost as if you have reached the end of the winding spring in a purely mechanical wind watch.  As an automatic, this watch runs about +28-30 seconds fast per 24 hours so I've had re-set time every 3-4 days. Last evening while pulling the crown out, the crown nut popped off the crown stem so now I have no way to set the time. Will have to open her up and replace with a new crown stem later (if I can find a replacement part) and also regulate the time. So its been two weeks  time since I've gotten this watch and its twin (that one has a pepsi bezel). That one with the pepsi bezel is a little better with regard to crown movement/adjusting, and runs +5-7 secs fast. Will review that one later."
2.0,Think this product is made for petit women or you girls. The diameter is too small and rather short.<br /><br />Plus side - material is as pictured. Nicely packaged as well.
2.0,"I like the way it lays down. Other than that it is still to big, I need to send it back."
2.0,This dress does not hang well.  It bunches up into a not very flattering fit.
2.0,"I purchased these for my boyfriend who is 6'1&#34;, 165 lbs, and waist size 32. I ordered a size small for him based on the sizing chart and other reviewers recommendations. When they arrived he was initially unhappy with the color, as they appear far more yellow than khaki. However, he tried them on and said they were comfortable so he would be fine wearing them.<br /><br />The shorts are very long, and they reached halfway past his knees, but for some reason the crotch area was very tight, almost as if they were made for a woman's physique... Everything was on full display, and the seam in the middle of the shorts was dividing 'things' VERY obviously. (Google 'moose knuckle' if you're unsure what I'm trying to allude to.) It was a bit ridiculous how much was on display!<br /><br />I would have chalked it up to the sizing being off, and ordered him a larger size in another color, but I had ordered my dad a pair of the same shorts in an extra large and he had the exact same problem. The shorts fit correctly everywhere except for the crotch area. The length, waist, and butt area fit fine, but you'd have to be a woman to wear these and not turn a few heads! Yikes!<br /><br />Unfortunately I ended up returning both pairs, which was disappointing because they were a great price.<br />As an addicted Amazon buyer, I rely on real people's opinions to make educated decisions about what items are worth it to spend my hard-earned money on. Because of this, I aim to leave good, informative reviews for others! If you found my review helpful, please do me a favor and mark it 'Helpful' below! :)"
2.0,Cheap looking and very bulky.
2.0,"Although it is an attractive design, the color is NOT ""Olive"", it is very YELLOW-ish, not at all like the picture or what you are used to the color olive being (a woodsy green with hues of tan and gray).  Since paying $26.43 for a pouch I especially don't like the color of is too high, I tried contacting the seller THREE times, and never got a response.....UPDATE:  On the Fourth attempt to return, I got a return label and authorization....and was given a refund after i returned it.  ....Note:  the other day i saw some brightly colored pouches of the same design at a discount store, either Fred's or Dollar General, for less than $10....(none olive green, so i didn't get one of those, either.)"
2.0,"I ordered one shirt and it fit perfectly, ordered a 2nd in multicam and it was way too big.  I didn't want to waste my time ordering another one because I am unsure which one is the wrong size.  Did they mess up on the first one or the 2nd one, I couldn't find a label anywhere."
2.0,"Bar wings upside down, parts falling off, seams not secure, faux leather torn… don’t buy from this seller."
2.0,Super thick material. The picture is distorted. Wanted to wear for my teaching job but it seems like it will have to be a winter outdoor mask. Disappointed.
2.0,"Kind of expected a little bit more durability and better wear before holes appeared.  The sizings listed run small, I ordered an extra large, but unfortunately there's no larger options beyond that, so if you're less than a extra large you should be okay size wise. If not, expect them to be tight.  Not good combinations not to mention the pricing was a little bit high for three pairs, especially with the premature wearing occurring.  I'll most likely be looking elsewhere at different options for this pricing."
2.0,They are bigger than I expected but that's not the issue. The issue is the stick hangs out so far. It hardly is thin enough to stick thru both sides of the earing and then it sticks out 3/4 of an inch from whichever side you inserted it. Deff cannot wear if you have hair and even if your bald you will look awfully weird w that much stick just poking out of your ears.
2.0,"Very disappointed.  The material is very cheap.  Does not look like photo.  The photo shows the material of the dress to be pretty substantial, however, in person, it's very thin and cheap.  Really not worth the $30+.  It looks and feels more like a $15 or $20-at most dress."
2.0,The first one broke in the seasons swim session. Badly made.
2.0,I really love these boots. They are so soft and comfortable. The<br />8 1/2 run alittle short. Next pair ill get a 9 in order to wear thick socks.
2.0,"It fits great, I just do not like the color. I wanted a navy blue shirt this is more turquoise, I am just not a fan of the color."
2.0,Cheaply made and runs a size and a half smaller than described.
2.0,"Doesn't really look like the top in the add. The mesh is barely half way down the back and the color is dull and not as pictured. Bought one to try it, not going to purchase any more."
2.0,I debated over this top and where to buy for MONTHS. It came and I was very disappointed. It's a hard v around the neck and the fabric is like a t shirt ribbed (not noticeable) it's not as long as pictured. More like a long old school t shirt where if u sit any crease will stay I am about 5'6&#34; 180 super disappointed.<br /><br />Please mark helpful if this was helpful to you. Thanks
2.0,Small and feels cheap.
2.0,Beautiful hat in the picture but not the hat that comes in the package. It looks nothing like the nice hat in the photo.
2.0,"If you have a small or petite face, do not get!"
2.0,"So I DID like this belt a lot... at first.<br />It’s comfy to wear and stretches so if you get bigger this belt is great<br /><br />4 months into owning it and this thing is useless. The equivalent of a shoelace around my waist, if not worse than that.<br />I find myself pulling up my pants all the time, or hosting them up because this thing just isn’t working<br /><br />In my case I lost weight and it seems like after it’s stretched it doesn’t stretch back<br /><br />Now when I wear it i feel like a shoe string would do a better job as a belt<br />It does keep my pants from completely falling down but it really doesn’t do much more than BARELY keeping up my pants<br /><br />It’s just meh, and for the high price I think there’s better items on the market"
2.0,It will not fit most masks. If put in the filter pocket the inner liner of the mask still is loose around the mouth.
2.0,The measurement on the page is incorrect. The bust is only 19.5”. It is smaller than the Small size I got from other seller. Returning it!
2.0,RETURNED THE BRACELET.
2.0,"So disappointed.  I love Leggings Depot leggings, they are super soft and comfortable.  But even the largest size of the jeggings was too tight on me (5'5&#34;/205lbs)..  I would have reordered if I could go up another size."
2.0,"I thought this was going to be a nice light sweater for spring, but I just don't like the design. The body of the sweater is fine, and the neck has a collar on it that actually looks really nice. Unfortunately, the sleeves are not long enough to wear like a normal sweater, but designed to set a few inches shorter than your arm. I personally hate that style. From the picture you can't really tell that. If you try to pull them down it stretches out the sweater and it just looks wrong. If I am a bit cold and want to wear a sweater, then it is mostly my arms that are cold and they are not covered by this.<br /><br />On the plus side, the material is very soft and comfortable. I really want to like this because it feels so nice, but I just can't get over the sleeve length. If this is not an issue for you, then you will probably love this. The rest of it looks so nice, why couldn't they have just given it normal sleeves???"
2.0,These are literally cheaply made flannel pj pants. Fit terribly.. just don’t waste your time… we’ll if you have no curves what do all they might fit… but the quality is not good.
2.0,This is a lovely well made chain.  It is so shiny and almost white silver.  Very nice way to hold a pendant!<br /><br />******* Now I am not as excited about the chain.  I have had it for a week and it has broke.  SO I have changed my review.<br />I am so disappointed!!! ********
2.0,The hole for the head had no stretch and I couldn't get my head through the hole. It was absolutely ridiculous.
2.0,"AS other purchasers said, looks much worse than the original ad. The current picture is correct; but is not the photo (different mask) that was pictured when I and many others bough it."
2.0,These mustaches are very cute. The problem with them is that you can’t peel the backing away from many of them and many of them did not stick. Approximately 20 out of 48 were usable.
2.0,Paint peeled of after a week of using
2.0,The bar is thicker than a standard eating thereby requiring gauging before use. Maybe I read it wrong but I don't remember it mentioning it wasn't a standard size. Earring a themselves seem very sturdy and exactly as pictured
2.0,It was not what I expected.  I was basing it on other Active Women's Plus Size tops - it was skimpy in size and didn't feel comfortable to wear.
2.0,"Do. Not. Buy. While the look of this cardigan is pretty and is well made, it has major drawbacks. The color is nothing like the description. It’s more brown. But the worst part is I sized up one and ordered the XXL. When I pulled it out of the package I knew it was not even remotely close to a size large. I ended up giving it to my daughter who is a size small and it fit her great, since The price to ship it back would have cost me even more."
2.0,Top looks nice its a good material.  The flared out part is really big. Maybe its the style? Or maybe its a maternity  top?
2.0,Cheaply made. Good for one night in a dark club and then toss it.
2.0,For the first week they were beautiful but quickly became dull and tarnished.
2.0,I bought this for my 5 year old boy. He usually wears size 6 but decided to go a lot bigger so it’ll last. I went with a size 7. This shirt did not fit ! Looks like a 4T.  They don’t have a bigger size than 7. I have to return.
2.0,The description states this is a leather band.  It feels very cheap and like it will be easily torn.  The straps are very flimsy and slick like plastic.  Very disappointed for the price.
2.0,"So this top is boxy and nearly see through. It does look a bit like the picture, but not enough for me to keep it. I sent it back because the shoulders were just way to squared off"
2.0,It would have been perfect except for that scratch right in the middle of the print. I tried to look past it but I can’t.
2.0,This is very poor quality and the material feels cheap. It doesn’t fit like a well made garment should. Definitely not worth the money so I will be returning. Color is nice.
2.0,Wheel broke off after first use
2.0,"Es muy bonito,  pero decía que era se piel, pero no es, por eso le doy dos estrellas.!"
2.0,Somewhat small.  Not made particularly well
2.0,It nice but cheap first time in the washer it ripped never agian
2.0,"Thin and comfortable, but far from warm, good only till 30"
2.0,The jeans were made well.  They are just difficult to button and unbutton.
2.0,"Nice color but looks like something one wears to bed, not out for lunch. Unless size 2, do not purchase."
2.0,They aren't as described - the butterfly wings are the same size. Not one smaller for your daughter to wear.
2.0,fell apart in less than a month with normal everyday use
2.0,"The bag is beautiful and is a good size.  Unfortunately, the strap broke immediately upon hooking it into the attached loops and trying it on.  The clip broke off of the attachment to the rest of the strap on one side, and you can see that clip portion in the picture. The loop straps are too small to use alone, so the bag is useless without functioning straps.  I was looking forward to using the bag, but unfortunately it's too poorly made.  I have requested a return, but have not received a response.  Depending on how that goes I will be able to also rate the seller at a later date.  Shipping took a long time, which is another negative.<br />I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the bag looks nice."
2.0,"Still using this as of today. However, the interior liner stitching has come apart and the velcro is not built to last so probably replace it with snaps in the next few months"
2.0,These glasses are not sturdy at all. Haven't had a chance to wear them but once and the screw came out somewhere and they are useless.
2.0,Only need for a one time use
2.0,"Strange “collar” attempt. I can’t really explain it, but it looks better in the picture than it does when you receive it."
2.0,"Fast shipping, great seller, lens arrived in original plastic in a box but had two deep scratches, purely cosmetic but annoying all the same."
2.0,Had to give away to sister. This is the second one I try out and they are not true to size. She is 38C and this fits her! ?!! Go figure.
2.0,Unless you rebuilt like a toothpick DO NOT try this ‘gown’! I ordered large but it fits more like a small. The pleat down the front splays open all the time and it looks really dumb! No room for sleeping comfort at all. Made of a low quality flannel and is quite ‘crisp’ not the way a good flannel should be at all.  A very poor purchase.
2.0,Not worth the price when you see the workmanship and the fit.
2.0,"Cute glasses, but color was not as pictured or advertised. The color was not red, but more brown so I was disappointed. The shape was cute and not overly sized, but big enough for the face without looking clownish."
2.0,3 of my 4 tank tops broke within a week. The strap ripped right off of one and the top elastic came apart from the material. I'm 153lbs and ordered size large so it's not like I was way too big for them and stretching them out.
2.0,"Okay quality, but over-priced for what you really get. Fit as expected, but could be a little larger. A better design for the drawstring with something quicker and easier to tie would be a plus."
2.0,One of of the gauges rhinestones completely fell out. I wasn’t messing with it at all the whole circle just fell out while I was eating lunch with my sister.
2.0,waaaaaay too tight even though I went according to the sizing chart not very good support while running either.
2.0,"I really like the feel of these, but they are useless to me because they aren't opaque enough to conceal my tattoos. I can't use them for work like I'd planned because my tattoos are still visible. Shame, they fit nice and do feel pretty cool but they are still pretty see through."
2.0,Shipping was great the fitting for a 14/16 fit like a 10/12 one child barely fit it and the other could not
2.0,Clasp broke within a week of using
2.0,Very cheaply made. For price I didn’t have a super high expectation but I did expect more than the absolutely see through poorly sewn together dress I received. I would say this dress runs true to size if not a little on the big size. The sash that came with the dress is awkwardly small making it difficult to tie. Can I make this dress work? I’m sure but it’ll take quite a bit of adding and altering to not see every bit I have to offer.
2.0,"I am 5'8"" and weigh 140 and the medium is super large<br />I will return and try the small"
2.0,Super cute shoe but after 3 times wearing them the sole split from the base.  I tried gluing but no luck.  I am going to take them to a shoe doctor to see if he can help...but not worth spending 50$ to wear 3 times.
2.0,"Actually it's a cute dress, but I ordered my regular size and it is way way too small. It looks like I should have ordered 2 sizes larger. Will have to return."
2.0,These glasses are unbelievably poorly constructed. If you can just put them on and leave them on they look good. I like to take mine off and put them back on when I'm driving. This particular product did not work for that at all. Taking them on and putting them off means getting fingerprints all over both sets of lenses.
2.0,A really small face  compared to current fashion. Returned it
2.0,"Adorable idea for a costume hat. However, very poorly packaged. Arrived broken, both hat and feathers. Hot glue gun and new feathers will fix it up. Will fit anyone."
2.0,had to give it away as a gift
2.0,"Boots were hard, no give what so ever. They looked cute in the pictures and I was hoping they’d fit but they were tight to get your foot into and once mine was in there was a little to much space on the sides of my ankles. I returned them. They do run true to size though."
2.0,I was disappointed in these am keeping for my daughter but the hang funny.  Easy to open and latch though
2.0,"These were advertised as ""very cold"" temp gloves.  I've worn them several times in low 30s and they worked fine.  However yesterday, it was about 19-20 degrees, and my hands got cold, really cold.  I was surprised just how fast my fingers got cold.  I had to come in and put on a different pair of gloves.  I do not recommend these for cold temp areas.  Performance was poor.<br /><br />Also the inter-glove part is difficult to get on."
2.0,It isn’t as blousy as it shows in the picture. Boxy and thick.
2.0,"I returned this; the product, although tag sized correctly was wayyyyy too small.  Cute style and good quality though."
2.0,"Well it was written that its swarovski, but the u can see the pack &#34;p&m&#34; by yourself,  also that it has three layers white gold, but there is no any alloy on it prooving that its real gold. I bought it for a present and have no idea how to gift it now. I am very disappointed, its too irresponsible!!"
2.0,"I owned a Calvin Klein Packable Down jacket that i really loved. It got beat up after so much use and I bought this to replace that. I didn't like how it fit. I bought a M and it didn't fit well like my CK's. And the color didn't look the same as in the picture. I thought the quality was very good though, but I wasn't going to keep it because of the fit and color. Returned it. I realized that it wasn't eligible for free returns at the time of returning and spent around 10$ to ship it back."
2.0,Skinny width  and loose not a good buy for me.
2.0,Liked the compactness of product and many colors.  Don’t like the paper it is printed on because the colors are dull.  I have the original “color me beautiful” and prefer that glossier multifolded piece
2.0,"Not happy with the blue and pink bands. If you look closely at the pictures, the blue band is too big while the pink band size doesn't match."
2.0,"The product I doesn't match the images. The edges in the listing show frayed ends that are mostly straight. What I got has faux fraying, that is actually just perpendicular cuts on the perimeter. This is just one part of the costume I planned on wearing, so it's too late now to send it back. While the construction is good, the design quality does not match the seller images."
2.0,Disappointed. The band is absolutely huge. Does not adjust to a small wrist at all. Do not recommend if you have a small wrist.
2.0,"Yes, the style is really cute, and I loved the fabric and also the color.  But..... these shoes run super tiny, plus they are very stiff and uncomfortable.  I returned them."
2.0,"The good things about this dress were that the material was nice, it was packaged well, and it came very quickly. The disappointing things were that the fit was very boxy, blousy and unflattering. I will never wear it. Definitely does not look like the picture in the ad."
2.0,"One was unwearable because it was too thick to fit in a regular piercing, one was broken on arrival, and one was wearable and cute (the pearl). All of them need to be just a tad longer. They were super inexpensive, but still a waste of money. Keep looking."
2.0,"I thought  the purse would be larger  when it arrived instead it was VERY small, not like the picture. #NOTHAPPY."
2.0,"It says T-shirt, but it is very thin. not great. It also runs small."
2.0,Not extremely thrilled about the material but true to size for it being an oversized shirt. I usually wear an XL in women’s and this passes my elbows and almost down to my knees. I’m 5’3.
2.0,The onsie had stains on it when I got it.
2.0,"These look very little like the photo. The pockets are tiny and the cut isn’t slim at all. They look like straight leg pajama pants. There is way too much room in the front and back around the hips. Also, there’s not enough fabric for them to bunch at the bottom. They are way too short and my son is short for his age. I have a feeling that this photo is from a designer but the clothes are being made elsewhere. The design is really nothing like the photo. The good news is that they are very soft and comfortable."
2.0,These socks aren’t like the photo. They’re very thin and cheap and maybe come a few inches above the ankle (on adult) not above the shin/calf. They’re not black—more dark blue/navy and the photo is very thin and can barely be seen when they’re worn.
2.0,"Really cute umbrellas but very cheaply made,  First the stitching came out at the ends, which I repaired with nylon thread, then the plastic broke on the inside.  I tried to put it back but the pieces snapped so getting it to stay was impossible.  The other one seems a little sturdier, but when you have two boys - it’s two umbrellas or no umbrellas!"
2.0,The 3XL is supposed to be an American X-large. It is not. It fits more like a large. I was disappointed!  😞
2.0,Its a cute ring but broke in 2 pieces just after wearing it one time.
2.0,Loved all the colors. They stretch out too much. Started a new look I wear them as ankle warmers with my leggings.
2.0,Too big for 7 year old
2.0,"I wouldn’t call these maternity pajamas but they fit fine and were super-soft...<br /><br />I say “were” because I’ve had them less than a month and they already have 4 holes in them somehow! The material must be cheap, which is frustrating because I liked these pajama pants but don’t waste your money on them. These didn’t even make it through a trimester."
2.0,I loved the shoe and it looked great on but the right shoe started coming off my foot as I tried to walk after only wearing them for a day.  Made it very difficult to walk.
2.0,Strap sown together twisted on one side.
2.0,Be careful when looking for bi sunglasses. Make sure the bifocal part is located where you need it to be located. For me the bi part was too low on lens. Great to read but nothing else for distance
2.0,came broken up
2.0,I have not had these long and the quality is poor. They are cute but water seeps in. Not durable
2.0,"If you are a C or bigger bra size, this will not be a good fit for you.<br />It is really pretty but not comfortable at all, had to return"
2.0,The material of this shirt is not like a sweat shirt. It is slick and uncomfortable.
2.0,"I love the look of this bra, but when it came in it was way to small, had to ship it back"
2.0,It was extremely small and hard to read. He did enjoy the gift however.
2.0,This shirt is shapeless. And its too short. You can't tuck it in unless your 5'2. I like the sleeves. But thats it. Very disappointing
2.0,"The color itself looks nice, but the fabric feels like a jersey. Very slippery and no stretch. I was disappointed amd never wore it."
2.0,I probably need to order a size bigger
2.0,The bra was comfortable but offered little support. The padding bunches up and I had to rip a seam to take it out. It offers less support than a sports bra but it is very comfortable to sleep in. Again the padding had to be removed because it bunches up.
2.0,"Smaller than I wanted, XL size wouldve been perfect, love the material and design though."
2.0,Cheaply made. Thin.
2.0,"I  bought this because it says &#34;Totally Nickel Free&#34;. IT'S NOT! I have a severe allergy to nickel and after wearing this for one day yesterday, the back of my neck and chest where the necklace was touching is itching today. I don't want to return it, because I really like it and I got so many compliments on it, but it makes me itch. What's the point in keeping it if I can't wear it?<br />I hate to post bad reviews, but this was worth mentioning to other &#34;nickel allergic&#34; people."
2.0,Material very thin. Shows a camel toe. And you will be charged for your return.
2.0,"Cute bracelet but the elastic kept popping and I was afraid it would break completely causing me to lose my watch.  Couldn’t take the chance, plus the popped elastic looked awful."
2.0,Shirt is too small! I ordered an XL and it’s more like a L! Buy a size up...
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:63ba688594d9d125947b53c1629d1746]] I was able to wear them all day without any problems. They give some push up, but if you want super push up, you might be better off looking for the laced strapless bras.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Decent pricing for 2 bras<br />- Comes with two different designs and textures (One is thicker and the other one is lighter)<br />- Easy to put on and cut to size<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Doesn't come with wearing & washing instructions but pretty self-explanatory<br />- For the most part they stay on pretty well but the edges like to unstick and curl up.<br /><br />Updated Review:<br />I wore one of them to a beach wedding and sand got stuck on the bra. When I got home to wash them, it was hard to wash off and the glue on the sides was falling off. Most likely you cannot wear these many times due to the falling off glue."
2.0,"Nice shirt.  I don't like difficulty with returns at xmas, too much shopping to have a seller give you a hard time about returning a product when many variables are at play at xmas.  I would not buy from this seller again because of this.  Otherwise, the shirt is fine.  I basically was on my own if I were to return it.  Simplicity is important at xmas."
2.0,Loved it for the holidays but the clip came off the mesh. Had to send back.
2.0,"The hooks are rounded and are very difficult to attach to my bra hooks.  Takes several tries.  Wish I had selected something else, and don't want to go thru the hassle of sending them back or exchanging."
2.0,"I am usually a medium in dresses of this style. This one was way too small on the chest, neck, and arms. It was also very see through for a black dress. I think the style could be very cute if it fit right & the length was good."
2.0,Hangs like a bag ..too tight in bodice and arms .disproportionately designed.had to return
2.0,"The material is lightweight and very thin, cheaply made in China, as with everything made in China (low quality).  It’s such a hassle to return it, and I can still use it to bring my yoga mat and knee pad, but not much else; hence, the two-star rating."
2.0,Loose and flowy fabric. Not at all compression material. No support at all. Too sheer to wear alone.
2.0,"The dress looks very ""mom on the prairie"" its boxy and longer than pictured (hit right above knee, I'm 5'7). In addition to that the dress came damaged, the top button loop was broken. I would avoid."
2.0,Way too tight !! Material would be fine if it wasn’t so tight
2.0,I ordered the exact size I wear in all pants & these are too tight in thighs & ESPECIALLY the ankles. Super tapered. My wife and I both got a good laugh.  Save your money and dignity
2.0,Shirt was much smaller than I expected
2.0,"It runs a bit small. I am 5'5 and 125 pounds and this felt snug. The quality was not great, it was not put together well and you could see all stiches on the black elastic portion. I didn't even bother returning it. I donated it to good will."
2.0,"One of the very few times a product was purchased from Amazon. com and had a difficult time with size. However, the grandson received the gift with a smile and thanks."
2.0,"Quality is pretty good, although, it doesn’t feel original Santini quality; I’m ok with it but, careful with the size and make sure you get the color you really want."
2.0,The meltal clips can be very painful while sitting. I don’t wear them due to this.
2.0,I returned it because it was too small so this rating is not accurate. I m considering ordering a replacement in XL then I can give an objective review.
2.0,Good idea but wasn't actually a practical product. The plastic band inside is uncomfortable.
2.0,"Although I love the print of this kimono, the arms were too small for my arms...also, the fabric snags easily and had a pull in it. Wish it would have fit me."
2.0,Very thin and cheaply made. No padding anywhere not even on the shoulder straps.  I will keep this because I hate returning packages and it will only be used to carry dog toys/feed back and forth to different household.  Would never use this for hiking.
2.0,"The design is exactly what I expected, but when looking closely the lenses observe an imperfection on one of them. Apparently the polarized is observed with patches on the surface."
2.0,"I wanted to like these, and I now know why there are the same negative reviews about the horizontal/angled stitch lines that feel very awkward when you wear it.  Almost feels like the shirt is twisted.  I think without those seam/sewn lines across the front, these would be good.  I'm going to return them instead of workout with them so I can't comment on the durability."
2.0,Broke after one year of use. Only sits on a dresser so really disappointed.
2.0,"Material is extremely cheap. It feels like the cheap comforters we  had as kids. The cut is very boxy, and short, nothing like the picture. Overall cheaply made, and not flattering. Even if it fit properly, the material is laughable. Don’t waste your money."
2.0,I can't wear them for more than an hour because the thread at the top pokes into my ankle and irritates it.<br />Otherwise I love them.
2.0,The material is comfortable and perfect for stretching in class. My issue was the top kept folding down and when you working out this so annoying to be pulling them up.
2.0,I returned these. They weighed like a few ounces each...I swear...they were so light they felt too cheap for me. The bottoms were thin with little support and the size ran large for my daughter.
2.0,Looks good but not waterproof. I bought it as a rain coat and after spending 30 min in a rain I came home wet. Have to look for another one :(
2.0,"I would have loved this suit, very cute, but it was really short in the body area. If you have a short torso this will work for you. Mine also came with a tear in it."
2.0,I’m 5’5 and bought a small. It is so baggy and is pretty close to my knee. I thought this would fit a lot better than it does.
2.0,She said she liked it but the look on her face was not
2.0,"Model is so deceptive.  The material is super cheap and costumey ( for use of a better word).  It came very wrinkled as well and the tail did not flow like on the model at all!  The concept of the shirt is great, poor execution."
2.0,Fabric is not for me
2.0,"color not true to description.  Barely  looks olive drab, China's version of Army green."
2.0,cheap!!!  When will I learn to NOT order from talk show deals
2.0,"this shirt doesn't seem like AmelieBoutik.  Runs very small and the material is very thin, spandex-y.  Still love their clothes, tho!"
2.0,Is not what I expected and would like to return it. How do I do it?
2.0,"I love the fit of these pants but, unfortunately, only a few months into wearing they're bally and old looking.  Really poor quality and not cheap. My advice--try something else if this is what you're looking for!  Very disappointed"
2.0,I loved the fabric but the size was way to small.<br /><br />I ordered a medium and they fit like a x small. Sent them back  same day I received them.
2.0,This fit is very awkward.  Not for me.
2.0,Not good quality at all wouldn't recommend
2.0,"The price was right for what I thought was a closeout of a discontinued genuine LaLoop color, but  (a) unlike the higher priced version, the strap is not braided leather, but is just a kind of bungee cord, and (b) the length is so short for a man that you have to stretch to get it on.  Overall, a real disappointment, but I lost my old holder and really need a replacement, and it's too big of a pain to bother returning it.  My fault for being so trusting."
2.0,They sewed the mask so that you can’t even read all of the words!
2.0,We got this for our daughter and she was excited about it. When it got here the  wand was cracked the glasses came apart. Lucky my husband is handy fixed everything. But needed plastic glue.
2.0,Definitely runs too small
2.0,"I got about a year out of this. Not sure if this is real leather. The band separated recently and the inner part was disintegrating.  It did the job, but was hoping it would last longer."
2.0,cheaply made. ended up tearing it apart for the rhinestones.
2.0,So disappointed that only one light necklace was in the package - and it doesnt work
2.0,"Not at all what I expected.<br />I thought the crystal piece would be longer and thinner, but it was fairly short and stubby in a tear drop shape, not a crystalline, gem cut cylinder kind of design like the picture makes it appear. Because the gem piece was so thick, the dragons don't wrap securely around it and one of them has fallen out already, and I haven't even worn them yet.<br />The carved dragon piece is nice and heavy, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing for earrings.<br />The fishhook earring itself is cheap and not in the best shape. The loop that holds the dragon drop on was open on one of them when I got them and I had to fix it myself."
2.0,"WAY too small. I ordered my size (L) and even though it fit an XL would have been just right. Too bad, it's such a cute set"
2.0,The stretch was not enough initially... very tight to start.<br />Color did not do well will oils.<br />I have natural hair and use only coconut oil. Takes a few washes for the color not to bleed through. Messed up a few pillow cases.
2.0,"They are shorter than expected. I'm 5'3 and 140 and these come about two inches above the knee. They are almost like panty hose because of how thin and sheer they are. I was hoping to use these to wear dresses at work that are slightly too short, but since they don't reach the length they show on the picture they are useless to me."
2.0,The description is not correct
2.0,When I received the sweater I loved it.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  That being said when I got to work I realized there was a hole in the top seam.  This was the first time I had worn the sweater.  I’m really hoping the seller reads the review and will replace it.  If not for the hole I would have been extremely happy!
2.0,"Good quality leather, not rough but definitely far from buttery leather.<br />The corset does show midriff, so if you don’t want your stomach exposed you will need to wear something underneath.<br /><br />Unfortunately the hardware was rusted and in poor overall condition.<br />There was shedded skin all over the inside of the corset.<br /><br />Over all it is a nice sturdy “Steel Boned” corset.<br />However I will be returning it and ordering another one in hopes it is not previously worn."
2.0,"I'll take your word for it that it says what you say it says because it's so small, I can't read it."
2.0,The gems are beautiful but half of them fell off the same day.
2.0,"Received the item with a hole and the material was very thin and see-through. Very dissatisfied, I returned the product."
2.0,"FAlse advertisement. These goggles LEAK! and they fog up!!! After the first use, its a wrap!"
2.0,"i didn’t expect much out of this dress, granted it was very cheap. i’d say you definitely get what you pay for. the material is almost plastic-y and has a lot of static. the waist doesn’t really go in that much and for<br />me, it didnt accentuate my waist or really much of anything. it was cute but i’m going to be returning it as it was just too short, static-y, and didn’t look right on me."
2.0,Originally ordered XL PER the size chart and to large. Returned and order a large. The waist fit but had to pull them over my naval to fit the crotch.<br />To inconsistent in sizing.
2.0,Material was stretchy but uncomfortable. Big in the waist but didn’t fit my thighs.
2.0,"The slippers are nice, fit well and pleasant to wear. But, unfortunately, not made well to last: after four months of moderate in-house wearing both soles are pulled off: right one completely, left one - half way. Beware."
2.0,"**EDIT - Received three pink/burgandy sweaters and all three were sent back due to pink dye on the white back and half of the white sleeve.<br /><br />This is the second one I'm sending back. Both were delivered with pink dye all over the white sleeve and a pink stripe running down the back of the sweater. I'll try for a third one, and if it's not better I will move on to a different brand."
2.0,Love this shoe but I ordered a size 8.  The box said 8 but the shoe was a 6.5. I dunno If there was a mix up or what. Stinks.
2.0,One use. Waaah wah..
2.0,The shoes are cute super cute but the are men’s size so I ordered a size 8 thinking they were women because they gave a W and turns out I got a 8 men 10 women so inconveniently I have to send back and reorder .
2.0,"My friend insisted this shirt was amazing and that I just had to order one. I was just not feeling it, fit like a maternity shirt, not sexy."
2.0,Not at all what the picture looks like it what I thought I was ordering. The dress in the pic is dark gray and hits the model below the knee. I ordered a medium and got a light gray baby doll dress that hits about 3 inches about my knee. I’m 5’4” and a size 4-6.
2.0,"The product was way too tight even for a Large, it slips off my jaw and its really hard to see through and breathe. My partner experiences the same issues with it, the collar fits fine,  but we both have short hair and still struggle to fit in it. Maybe if there was a ab XL or XXL I'd try those."
2.0,These were not the ones that I have now. The lenses on these glasses are clear and the ones that I have are coded.. they look coded on the glasses but when they were sent to me they were just clear nothing on them.. I had to send them back waste of money.
2.0,"This is not a slip. Good if you have a small frame & just want a shaping cami, but wouldn’t be great for woman sizing or for anything other than a small C cup."
2.0,"Ordered 3 of these at a 36&#34; in waistline and only one fit correctly. The other two were at least 4&#34; off in size so i had to send them back. The material is more like a polyester look and feel versus your normal type material for a suite but its hard to see that just looking at photos. Buying a suit online is not the smartest thing to do because you certainly want to try it on, see if it fits and get a feel for it material. Prob wont buy this type of suit again"
2.0,This is a pretty top but fits me in a way that was not comfortable. It may fit someone else better.
2.0,fits too large and you can tell the cheapness of the material. It would be worth the time and money to buy something of a bit better quality. Returned.
2.0,"Fabric too thin, no side pockets..."
2.0,"I really liked the design of these shoes, but they were way too narrow!! Shoe Gal was very cooperative in return."
2.0,"Yikes! These are ""Dry Clean Only""?! Are you kidding me?!  I'll have to invest in the at-home dry cleaning kit and wash these separately.  Not convenient and over time costs more."
2.0,I first bought this shirt in small because that was the Amazon recommended size AND the reviews said they ran big. That was WAY TOO SMALL. I returned and got a large. The large was cut weird. It was long and hung weird.
2.0,"Buyer beware!! I ordered this dress in a large and it fit like a small. Even with the best undergarments, it still would be too small. I was disappointed and had to return it. Luckily, I found another dress in time for a ball I was attending."
2.0,"I don’t understand the appeal of these. Or maybe I got an “off” item?<br />The material is terrible, feels so itchy and thick, like the sweat from working out in them would just stay trapped. Not for actual workouts, but maybe just day to day wear would be okay, but would still be way too itchy for me.<br />The “butt scrunch” was worthless, just a 3 inch black stick in the butt crack area, didn’t do much. Disappointed.  ☹️"
2.0,"The quality is not very good, plastic like, cheap looking, does not look at all like real pearls.  Will probably work well as kids jewelry or simply to add to a costume.  I would not wear it anywhere else!"
2.0,The set is 3 masks but it only came with 2.<br />Totally bummed out about that but the material and fit is percect.
2.0,Fabric is strange and see through.
2.0,"Ordered an XL for my son.  Arms were super tight and short, over all fit just wasnt the best. returned"
2.0,THESE REVIEWS ARE ALL FAKE<br />Click on the names of these 5 star reviewers... they have all only reviewed 1 product (these sunglasses).<br />These are no better than the $5 sunglasses at gas stations that say they are “polarized”. You are definitely getting what you pay for here. They are for sale under a ton of different brands because they can be bought in bulk on alibaba/ aliexpress very cheaply. I wish Amazon would police the reviews a little better...<br />Pick these up if you need a pair of lightweight throwaway sunglasses but dont expect what all these reviews are claiming them to be
2.0,Weird material. Sizing runs rather small.
2.0,"These didn’t wash well;  they were pilly after one wash and I found 2 holes in them. Amazon is partnering with and choosing to sell some truly disposable clothes. They were comfy to wear to bed, but if you have a large bust, I do not recommend! They don’t provide any real support."
2.0,My kid wore these out pretty fast. Disappointment.
2.0,The stones fall out. Very poorly designed and made.
2.0,I usually wear medium and while this  shirt was very cute the medium was way too tight in the shoulders and back. I will probably give it has a gift to one of my smaller friends
2.0,Very small. I thought it was going to be a lot bigger but it's definitely very small and flimsy. Pretty when you can see it.
2.0,I love this bracelet. Had one last year but I needed a new one now. Received it last Wednesday and the poem was backwards and the elastic broke two days later so disappointed in that!
2.0,"Shorter than expected. Fabric was soft, but not comfortable. Sleeves felt too tight and didn’t give well with movement."
2.0,"Sound quality is mediocre at best. Don’t order a combo pack with extra lenses, they send you two different sizes. Customer service said they will exchange but I will have to pay shipping although Amazon is free returns."
2.0,"one of the items came poorly made, a couple of beads not rounded properly and some of them with two drilled holes which makes it look uneven, very disappointed with my purchase"
2.0,"I've had my ears at a 2 for years. The middle of the plug is a 2, but the flare is a 0 (I was up to a 00, so I compared to other earrings). This is a big jump for a smaller size; I cannot get them in. I even tried putting coconut oil on the plug and in the hole, it still feels like it's going to tear. They are beautiful and a great value otherwise. I've had plugs at 0 and 00 and it this has never happened."
2.0,I returned these.  The fit is ok but too short and they don't stay in place.
2.0,It’s Soft but it’s see-through. It’s also very sloppy looking.
2.0,runs very small in shoulders
2.0,I was pretty disappointed in these shoes.  They do not look like the original photo at all.  They are a flat gray and feel and look like cardboard.  They were also too big on me and did not feel comfortable.  They look cheap and have no style or softness/quality to them.  I returned them ASAP.
2.0,2 came not working . not impressed
2.0,"This dress is not attractive at all. The slits over the legs are a strange U-shape and the extra fabric above them doesn't drape, it just pokes out like a tiny inside-out pocket. I'm wearing it as a housedress. :(  The one in the photo must be several sizes too big for the model to get that cute draping."
2.0,This shirt was WAY too small and even sized up.
2.0,Not a high quality jacket
2.0,This bag was great for about 2 months until it began to fall apart. I am requesting an exchange  in the same color and model.
2.0,"Although these earring are cool, i found them too thick to fit through my pierced ears. It might work if you have your ears gauged a little bit, but if not its going to be a squeeze and its going to hurt. Not suggested for those with regular pierced ears, although they look really cool."
2.0,"Mask did not fit my teen well at all.  Large gap under her chin, and painful around her ears.  One of them the strap was even sewn on inside out."
2.0,"Came with small hole in the netting part....not a good start. I usually wear medium everything but looked at reviews and it said it runs small....it does. I ordered a large and it fit pretty good for the most part, a little big in the bust area. I am 5'8"" 140lbs and B cup."
2.0,The picture is blurry and not clear as shown in the photos. it looks fine from afar however you can tell that it is extremely pixelated if you're within reaching distance of someone.
2.0,"Ok I so wish I could have kept this, but the odor was just too strong. I purchased one, returned it, and the second had the same strong odor. It is SUCH a flattering bodysuit I would have kept it if it weren't for the smell. It fit great and it was flattering (I have a small frame and it made me look and feel sexy). The other strange thing is that there was no brand label in it, just a tiny tag with the size. So I think this product is most likely mass produced and then dyed the colors that it comes in - I got the maroon - and that the strong odor was perhaps from the dye that is used. Too bad."
2.0,"Material was very sturdy with the Zipper, clasps and Velcro strap on the neoprene makes it very desirable . This product though was to small even after measuring the waste and smallest being 37” didn’t fit at all and actually fell short to close by 6” at the front .  Will be asking for a refund solely on size only goes up to 3xxl for this brand ."
2.0,"It worked for the purpose I intended it for, to hold my engagement ring so it wouldn’t scratch my son while changing and dressing him but unfortunately it scratched my ring, it’s not a huge one but there’s two on it"
2.0,they were too big! quality is worth about 14.99
2.0,I’ve tried other of these kinds of glasses and this is the worst as far as doing what it claims.  There is no improvement in quality only a yellow view.
2.0,Very small. Measurements do not add up to the size chart. Disappointed but can still use it for the occasion.
2.0,"Once I got it over my hips it fit everywhere. But to get them over my hips multiple times a day, these wpuld have been a gonner. Returned them. Usually an XL ordered a 2XL didn’t fit"
2.0,"The straps on this dress were made for a child. It's impossible to wear with the straps adjusted as much as can be, it is still much too small and I  a small person.<br />I will have to make my own straps and maybe just cut off some of the bottom (which I could use for new straps) and make this into a cute top because it is crazy short for a dress.<br />Probably, I will end up donating this.<br />Won't buy this again."
2.0,Cute dress but cut way too small in the chest (36 DD). Also way too short. Maybe good for someone who is petite.
2.0,Pretty color - gets dirty very quickly.
2.0,They are cute but don’t stay up.<br />Weird material.
2.0,Very cute but no way are the sizes correct. Ordered an XL so they would be loose and comfy. Usually wear a size 10 but these were very small
2.0,"It is smaller than it appears to be in the photo and is very itchy, but still sexy."
2.0,"Barely above sleeping on a comforter thick, maybe use as a dog mat if you double or triple fold it."
2.0,"I’m not sure why these are advertised as bracelets, they are much too large to be used as a bracelet for the vast majority of people and there is no way to adjust them to make them smaller. This is a picture of me wearing it the smallest it will go, and I am by no means a small person. The lights work well but I’m not sure what I’ll use these for due to how big they are. If I had known they couldn’t be with as a bracelet I wouldn’t have bought them."
2.0,Cute suit. I am a size 6 and ordered a large and it was still way too small. The suit is made from a cheap sort of nylon that doesn’t stretch very much.
2.0,did not fit me it was small I gave it to my cuz and she loves it very sexy
2.0,"Item Baby Soft Cotton Panties Little Girls'Briefs Toddler Underwear (Pack of 6), Collection A-bpurple, Size 2-3, Price 11.99, My daughter has been using this for more than a year ... These things are really cute, but i dont like the thick fabric, the bulky seams, elastics are thigh on the waist but flimsy on the leg, it is a very weird design... these are use  but as second choice, when the better ones are dirty. I won;t buy these again."
2.0,The first day I used it the material holding the clip broke.
2.0,"My son won't even be able to wear these, they are sized way too big and when he does get to wear them he will already be walking!"
2.0,"The fit of the product was excellent, however, just 2 days after my son began wearing his slippers one of the eyes popped off."
2.0,"If it weren't for the &#34;backside&#34; chain part having issues with metal burrs snagging my sweater tops and such, I would have given it at least a 4.  Good Delivery Experience though."
2.0,Very cheap.<br /><br />Bought two pair.  The nose pieces on both pair were bent very badly.  Not worth the money.
2.0,"These are super light, but they come with this film that is very hard to remove.  I was able to get one lens but unable to even notice where to pull on the second lens.  If you are looking for something super light with wire arms- then you will like this."
2.0,disappointed.it's not made that well and the straps don't go on right.
2.0,Thicker material than legging almost like a soft jean material just very stiff. I bought a bigger size and there pretty tight they have some stretch to them. Good thing there are pockets on the hips and thighs.
2.0,After 2 wash the shirt shrink atleast one size.
2.0,"I returned this dress. The material wasn't as soft as I had hoped and didn't have a lot of give. Also, it didn't hang right. The drop shoulders didn't drape; they made me feel like I was wearing shoulder pads."
2.0,"It's a good reminder that stitching is something regularly taken for granted here in America.  The shirt I received had a lot of loose threads all over the shirt, shaking the shirt helps with getting many of them off.  Then there's all the threads hanging out wherever they ended a stitch, or started a new line of stitching, it's a little on the ridiculous side, probably the worst quality I've seen from of any piece of clothing I've ever seen or heard of.  I give it two stars because the fabric looks good, and maybe I can make this wearable for at least the weekends, until it falls apart at the seams...  Buyer beware."
2.0,Too small sadly
2.0,"The fit was good through the waist and butt. Length was good, But the shorts are basically bell bottoms. I don't have massive quads by any means, but the leg hole are nearly the size of the waistline. It’s absurd. Wouldn’t Suggest getting these."
2.0,"They are ok size wise they disappear like they should. However, they fold up while wearing far too easily"
2.0,Too many wrinkles...I don't iron.
2.0,Studs on the back of the ear rings are shaped weird and hurt to put in.
2.0,Easy to read with a beautiful face. The band is very delicate and unravels on the side.
2.0,Delivered fast. The chain broke after one wear.
2.0,"So I love this coat.  I do not like coats that are to tight and make it hard to wear layers with them.  I am 5' 4&#34; and 118 lbs and the small was very comfortable.  I had plenty of room in it to wear two layers of clothing under it and still be able to breathe and zip it up and have a bit of room.  So I was very happy with the look at fit of the coat.  I gave it a 2 because of the smell.  I can't wear this coat because of how strong the faux leather smell is.  It smelled up my whole living room and kitchen as soon as I took it out of the box.  I looked online to try to find ways to reduce the smell.  I wiped vinegar on it 4 times and let it dry.  I tried putting it in a container with baking soda.  I tried washing it.  Nothing seems to get rid of this smell.  It makes me embarrassed to wear it anywhere because of just how strong it smells.  So while I love this coat...I don't really wear it as much as I want because of the smell.  If I'm going to be around a lot of people, I just can't wear it cause its over powering.  I really hope after wearing it some it will tame the smell...but so far it has not.<br /><br />UPDATE:  As I stated above, I do not wear this coat often because of the smell.  I went to wear it today and noticed that after 3 times of wearing it the lining the in the pocket already had a whole in it and the seam for the lining of the arm already has a hole it in.  Very upset to see this thing is falling apart already after very minimal use."
2.0,"At the time of purchase in 2017, the description said suitable for women but upon receiving the item it was too small and very uncomfortable."
2.0,Ordered this shirt in a small for a gift and was very disappointed when it arrived. It does not fit like a women's shirt at all. It fits more like a cheap kids t-shirt. Very wide and too short. Printing is fine but the shape of shirt is terrible. Having to send it back.
2.0,Very thin bottoms not enough insulation for cold weather application
2.0,"I love the look of these shirts but the fabric is inferior. They have the unpleasant feel of slippery, coarse,  nylon rubbing together when you hold the fabric between your fingers—the kind of feel that sets your teeth on edge , if you know what I mean. That said, I have worn them once or twice when my other shirts were in the laundry, and once I was off and running it felt fine and I didn’t notice the icky fabric. Also, I think they may improve somewhat with washing but if you are real picky about softness on your skin, I would not recommend. Also they run small. I am 5”4’ 150 and ordered the extra large (normal for me is large or xl), and I had to return. I returned and got the XXL, and they are OK, but skin tight."
2.0,"For the price i thought they were decent socks, in less than 2 weeks most of the socks have holes along the toe seem. I keep son's nails pretty short so no the holes were not of his doing. The holes were in different places for each sock. Material is flimsy."
2.0,These shorts run really big. Down size!
2.0,"I only recieved one of the two I ordered and although the umbrella itself was sturdy and well made, the painted details were very lacking. Which was a shame. It kind of ruined it. I would not order again."
2.0,"Too small, they fell out of my lip which they shouldn't have , I screwed them in very tightly ."
2.0,"The watch I received had defects resulting from the  OEM's sloppy assembly of the item &  inadequate quality assurance:<br /><br />- Badly misaligned hour hand (about 20 minutes off).  (When minute hand is at 12, hour hand is at 20 past the hour).  This isn't the usual 'subtle' sort of misalignment, but quite gross and makes it difficult to tell the time.<br /><br />- Small seconds hand STOPS anytime watch is positioned with 12 O'clock down, as typically it is worn on right wrist.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Fammis listing advertises it as having a Sapphire crystal, but  I have my doubts.  Water tends to 'bead' on a sapphire surface, and a test I've found is reliable,  to check whether the crystal is sapphire involves depositing a drop of water on the watch glass.  If the drop collapses and loses shape, then the glass is  made from something OTHER than sapphire, such as mineral glass, or acrylic. If the drop remains a nice round 'drop', holding together, not spreading out, the crystal *might* be synthetic sapphire; but that is not definite -- the drop will stay well formed on other types of material having 'hardness'  approaching that of synthetic sapphire,  examples being Seiko's &#34;Hardlex&#34;, or Invicta's &#34;Flame Fusion&#34;, which both pass this test.<br /><br />On *this* Parnis 'Portugese' watch's crystal, the drop of water quickly collapsed and spread ... ergo, IMO, sapphire NOT!<br /><br />On the positive side:<br /><br />- The power reserve complication works fairly well, except that the indicator range doesn't fit very well to the max/min winding states.<br /><br />- the watch contains a pristine Sea-Gull ST-2505 ébauche, which has simple but very well-done decoration (perlage) -- this is by the OEM as part of standard production of this caliber.<br />- the watch keeps time exceptionally well for an automatic movement: I measured on a time-grapher and got +6.5 s/d, (average of 5 positions, with delta &#60; 4 s/d) - bordering on chronometer level  performance & remarkable for an unadjusted movement.  Sea-Gull has publicly stated that it keeps it's best movements for it's own watches.  I would tend to guess that  products are to be distributed to third parties (other watch makers, Parnis shops, etc.), unless there is some special arrangement, Sea-Gull doesn't allow the attention necessary for to really fine-tune their movements.  In the real world, the ébauches tend to be  inconsistent  and it is up to someone else, usually the retail customer, to get them cleaned up and regulated for accuracy.  I think most of the movements (including ST-25xxx)  found in chop-shop brands out of China or Hong Kong are likely to be considerably less accurate than this one.<br /><br />Despite being neglected after being brought into this world, the ST-2505 is a relatively recent vintage calibre and has an interesting, sophisticated design, based on Sea-Gull's having studied the 'state-of-the-art' in watch-makaing,  then borrowing from what they considered the best models.  At least on paper the ST-25xx compares with entry-level in-house movements of  top Swiss & German luxury brands.  So having a watch with this movement  provides some cheap thrills if you happen to be someone who gets excited about exotic miniature-mechanical systems of this kind.  Note: owing to problems getting a prototype to operate with stability at originally intended hi-beat 28.8K standard, Sea-Gull engineers decided to down-rate the ST-25 to operate at 21.6K..<br /><br />In summary:<br />My initial inclination was to return this watch - it is, as the title of my review states, a total stinker (from an assembly, manufacturing standpoint).  However, since the movement turned out to have excellent accuracy, I have decided to keep it.  ...+6.5 s/d is quite fabulous, and furthermore the time-keeping is stable, with scarcely any positional variation.  I can probably figure out how to align the hour hand myself, and I can live with the crippled small seconds hand, which is, in the final analysis, 'small' and mostly decorative anyway.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that whatever is interfering with the motion of the small seconds hands won't eventually also cause deterioration of the accuracy of the main hour and minute hands.<br /><br />While this watch has many redeeming qualities, and in this review I didn't even mention it's beautiful sunburst silver dial, ....the fact is that the watch sent to me is badly made, and I believe falsely advertises a sapphire crystal.  This is a coveted feature and highlighting that it has a Sapphire crystal in the title of the item seems unlikely to be just an oversight.  Amazon shoppers have directly asked Fammis if it is a Sapphire crystal, but Fammis gave no response. In my opinion purchasing this product from this seller is a very risky proposition.  If my review has planted doubts in you mind, I think you are having an appropriate response!  I got badly burned on this purchase, and I think odds high that the same could happen to you - so my only recommendation on this one is: BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />ON THE OTHER HAND, If you can't resist the allure of the Parnis Portuguese, and it is a very attractive piece, available for not much money.  So if you are willing to take the risk, you could get lucky and get 'a good one'... clearly from reading the reviews, there are others who have been more fortunate than I was!"
2.0,I have a slightly larger than normal head but these caps are super small.  Other one size fits all caps fit fine.
2.0,I bought it for a concert but I couldn’t wear it it was so hot
2.0,"I don't the quality of the dress, I  thought that this dress in gonna be in cotton. Poor quality!"
2.0,"These are small and cute but they were mostly red , not the various colors as advertised. There were two of the light blue, no clear, no dark blue & only 2 mocha color. Not at all why was advertised or why I needed so I couldn't use them for what I needed. Not recommended if you need more than red."
2.0,the sunglasses nosepiece is too narrow to fit my glasses
2.0,Way to small. Order several sizes up. The fabric is nice though
2.0,bigger than I wanted
2.0,Simply and too expensive
2.0,"This is basically the equivalent of wearing a tube top....no support and no coverage, which I didn't really expect, but the girls have a really hard time staying &#34;inside&#34; - and my girls aren't that big. Can't recommend."
2.0,"lasted 2 month, 8-10 times swimming and the strap broke,"
2.0,Not happy sized too small
2.0,Shirt was delivered with a black stain on the front Like a black magic marker stain.Tried to get it out. Washed a few times still there.Very disappointed.
2.0,Much too big for a little girl.<br />Besides that looks nice
2.0,The soles began separating within a couple of months of use.  Not well constructed.
2.0,"This beach cover-up is great! The material is very soft and quality. While its a great cover-up the sizing is completely off, at least in my case. Even being top heavy the entire cover-up was so large. It completely swallowed me up.<br /><br />I had to send it back, but I would recommend this if your closer to Medium than small for the S/M and probably closer to a large for the M/L."
2.0,Beautiful but a size &#34;L&#34; is actually like &#34;M&#34;
2.0,"This is my second time ordering this jacket. First time I ordered large and it was too small. I'm big chested (44"") and thought the large would fit me. I reordered it in an xl and IT FITS THE SAME AS THE LARGE.<br /><br />I reordered it in green. It's not green at all. It's a teal, not that nice dark green in the picture.<br /><br />The outside is nice and fuzzy, but not warm enough inside on a cool day.<br /><br />Sizing and color is way off."
2.0,My daughter has been wearing these for 5 days and the Velcro is coming off. She’s not normally rough on shoes - her previous sandals lasted 10 months. I’m very disappointed in the quality. She loves the colors and fit otherwise.
2.0,"I purchased this dress for my 3 year old daughter for dress up play because she asked for a &#34;real Elsa dress&#34; for Christmas. While she absolutely loves the dress... It is about 2 foot too long for her. I ordered the dress in a size 4 and it all fits perfectly except for the length. It is not something she can wear unless I have someone take the length of the dress up quite a bit. I wish it would have been a true size 4, my daughter is severely disappointed she cannot wear her new dress!"
2.0,Keeps coming off
2.0,"Would probably be more like a small than medium, it had an awful chemical smell when I opened the package, and the fabric was very cheap. I was very disappointed as this was gift for my daughter."
2.0,"I wanted a smaller crossbody bag to alleviate lower back pain from carrying a heavier bags but this was too small. My bare necessities, slim wallet, smartphone, eyeglasses, work badge and keys were too much for this bag. It was bulging and I couldn't zip it closed. I found another crossbody bag at my local Target which met my needs and more stylish. I'll donate the Amazon bag to charity."
2.0,"Not a good fit for my body type, plus it runs large. I think if it was smaller it would look a lot better on me."
2.0,"These are very soft and the material is stretchy, which I like, BUT there is no compression to the lower stomach area and it’s very obvious camel toe in the front. The color is gorgeous I just wish it was more fitting in the front!"
2.0,Disappointed that I would treat myself to these for all the cold days  but they are just gloves nothing special my hands are still cold
2.0,its tiny! TINY MADE FOR 12 YR OLDS.
2.0,"The color is more of a hot pink.  Not at ALL a red color as described.  In fact, if pink were a purchase option, I would have thought that they mistakenly sent me the wrong color.  Fits a bit large, but it does not matter as I wouldn't wear a hot pink polka dot swimsuit even if the fit were great.  Cheaply made, but I expected as much given the cost."
2.0,"I usually wear a 9.5, but ordered a size 10 since they didn't come in half sizes. The 10 is too small for me. They are cute and comfortable otherwise."
2.0,Following the  reviews i ordered 2 sizes larger. I usually can wear an XL and I ordered a 3xl and it's very tight around the arms. I'm sure some stretching and pulling it would be comfterbale. I do like the material but the sizing here is way off. I will be returning for a larger size
2.0,"I sized up to the next size from my normal size and this dress did not fit. It looked great from the front but would not for the life of me and the extra set of hands I enlisted, zip up."
2.0,Simply does not stay on my face. Awkward fit.
2.0,These earrings are HUGE.  They top part alone is as big as a quarter.  They are also heavy and clangy.  I would not wear these for more than a couple of hours without my ear holes hurting.  I got the silver pair and I would describe the material as looking like crumpled up tin foil.<br /><br />The design reminds me of the '80's (which is actually coming back in style).
2.0,ALSO THERE IS NO NOSE WIRE INSIDE THE MATERIAL FOR A GOOD FIT.
2.0,Not made for tall girls. I'm 5'9. Too short. It also makes your butt look big. It was a pretty material though.
2.0,The charms fall together.  Additional spacers would make this much more desirable.
2.0,"Sadly this had to go back. I ordered a Large, and it is to wide at the shoulders and under arm, but too short in length. odd fit, like it should be marked petite. The material is pretty thick and ribbed with a silky like feel. for reference I am 5' 7"" and 140 lbs. 32 D bust."
2.0,Look very cute. But the stone fell of the first day.
2.0,"I purchased this Leadingstar Women Sexy Perspective Splicing Tassel Swimwear Cover up Beach Dress because it looked great online!  It was advertised as plus size as well.  TOTALLY misleading!  It is NOT a dress, but rather a shirt that I would never wear.  I am 5’4”and a size 16 so we can’t blame my size for the length of this “beach dress”.  It is also not large enough to fit comfortably over a suit wet or dry.<br />Very disappointed and will return.<br /><br />**I received this product at a discounted rate or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope this review will be helpful to others, please click helpful button if my review indeed helped you out. Thank you! 👍"
2.0,"This looked like a cool jacket.  But the sizing is way off.  I got a 2XL and it barely fit my son, who is 50 lbs lighter than me.  He wears between a L and XL.  Be careful.  If you wear a 2XL, get it somewhere else."
2.0,Got these for cycling and to cover my ears for the ride.  They do not go over my ears eventhough the picture shows that.  I do like the water whisking material.
2.0,I didn't get the design I wanted but worked ok while I was 9 month pregnant
2.0,I wish I could return this.
2.0,"This Apple watch bracelet is very pretty, and I wish it had been designed better. Unfortunately, the ""buttons"" that are used to adjust the bracelet do not stay put, and work their way down the beads almost immediately. Back it goes."
2.0,Go way up in size
2.0,I bought this to spruce up my outfit for my best friend's funeral. They looked pretty but that's the only plus. And as soon as I opened the package one clip was crooked and when I put it on my shirt the face just fell to the floor while the pin was still on my shirt. Horribly disappointing! So now I have one broken clip and I didn't even get to wear it and the other clip is extremely loose and keeps moving back and forth. Now I don't even have time to return them and get new ones because I have to fly out to NY from LA for the funeral. This is really inconvenient and unfortunate.
2.0,It's not the same color. And it's to big than expected. Btw i use it like a sleeping dress
2.0,I ordered large 1”<br />Received very small size
2.0,Although the product appears well made it does not stay on my head at night so the function is completely lost.  It’s a bit disappointing because I really need a product that will keep my hair from breaking at night.
2.0,The lace looks cheap.  Not sewn professionally.  Too pricey for the quality.
2.0,"Very cute bracelet for about a week and then the metal turns to a rusty color and all the shine wears off. the band also faded significanty. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
2.0,Nice dress but only for women with smaller bust. The dress Is the color that I expected and also the material I expected however it is not flattering unless you are very petite
2.0,"Great color and flattering cut, fabric is not at all wicking so sweat shows immediately during moderate workouts."
2.0,cheap material and quality;
2.0,"This pajama set was great and warm and cozy before the first wash! I am 150 lb and 5'9'' and I ordered M , which was loose and long, exactly as I wanted it. But it shrank!! and now the sleeves and pants are so short :("
2.0,"Found a strange substance in one of the tunnels, almost looked like ground beef. Very strange."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but a large was too tight & that is my normal size."
2.0,Too small. Had to return. I wanted it to be oversized
2.0,Cheap Looking....
2.0,Poor quality and didn’t fit me at all
2.0,"Was for my wife but didn’t fit well so never use them,"
2.0,Was not worth the price.  Did not look high quality
2.0,Didn't block blue light for me
2.0,ARM Holes are GIGANTIC!
2.0,Nice glasses but NO spring hinge.
2.0,It faded its color too soon
2.0,"I strongly dislike the fact they call a smooth lining  ""FLEECE"".  A fleece lining resembles the look of the wool on a sheep."
2.0,"Very disappointed in this dress. The color is pretty, but material is awful. It looks like the cheap, thin, silky gowns you use to get from Walmart back in the day. I am 5'4, 120 lbs, 34c. I ordered a medium. Material is so thin and clingy. I added a belt hoping to help it look better. You may not be able to tell in the pictures but you literally have to have very little fat on your body for this to be flattering. You have to have a flat stomach for sure. It shows every single flaw. The stitching at the bottom is terrible. I wish I would have listened to the bad reviews. I believe I'm returning this."
2.0,This dress is not as long as pictured.
2.0,"This item looks great but unfortunately after a month and a half, they are starting to get a little rickety near where the metal and plastic come together on the arm.  Of course this happened a couple days after it was too late to return them.  I guess you get what you pay for...."
2.0,So the bottom part fits but the top just draped awkwardly and makes me look pregnant. Very unattractive.
2.0,The product was too small.  I ordered up one size and it actually fits 2 sizes smaller.  Once I managed to get myself into the product I must admit my breasts did look just like the advertised picture.  With the tightness though I assure you they had nowhere else to go.  Otherwise the product is well made.  The fabric is very soft and I would recommend it to petite women.
2.0,"First thing my daughter said as I pulled these pants out of the package was, ""Mom! They're see-through! I can see YOU through them!""  Well, since I am always cold, putting spandex leggings underneath should solve the problem, at least during belly dance class<br />I love the design, but as always it is too short. I am 5'10"" and 130lbs and bought the Medium size, which is fine, except the length."
2.0,"First time using with three suits (three piece suit with shirts), three ties, a pair of sneakers and house slippers and the strap broke. This happen when I was walking to the train fortunately I was just about to sit down."
2.0,"I got it for my nephew, it did not fit him and it is made of cheap material."
2.0,Wish it was true to size because I think I would have loved this....
2.0,I loved the dress but ended up returning it because it arrived with a stain on it.
2.0,"I ordered Gray and pale pink.  I received mauve and hot pink with White ear muffs to attach.  Not like the pictures at all.  Also too small for Americans.  I'm a woman 5' 8"" and weigh 185 lbs.  The ear muffs wouldn't stretch far enough back to cover my ears.  Big disappointment. Would be good for a child."
2.0,This was mailed to me in a bag and the wire was completely bent making it impossible to wear.
2.0,To small for the average size woman.
2.0,"These are amazing sunglasses... however, the damn ear hook broke. The ear hooks are obviously way to weak on these sunglasses. I love them in every way, but they need to be handled with delicate care or you'll break the ear hooks.<br /><br />Julbo: I've had them less than a year, will you warranty them?"
2.0,Looks weired when I put it on my wrist
2.0,"neat voice changing ability, comes with battery. but the strap broke the second time I attached it. also couldn't tell it was only half a mask until after I bought it"
2.0,Didn't care for them.  Doesn't fit as expected. I was looking for surf shorts. These are too short and loosen in water.
2.0,Product much smaller than antipated.
2.0,"I’ve run a review of insulated winter skirts and I tried this one in two sizes.  I’m a solid medium in most sizes, but the large was more comfortable with leggings under it in this skirt.  I’m sad to say that this was the least insulated out of all the skirts I tried.  Additionally, the super slick interior made the skirts ride up when I sat down.  I prefer a top starting zipper over a bottom starting zipper.  Sorry, Big Agnes, this skirt is still in need of adjusting…"
2.0,Got two pairs of shorts and no top
2.0,Gave me pain in my ears and itching ..
2.0,"This product is “you get what you pay for”. Just didn’t have the fabric quality or construction that I’d want for a jacket of this style. I have plenty of “slouchy” jackets/cardigans; that’s not what this is. The way it’s cut, I expected something sharper looking, but cheap fabric just didn’t work with this design."
2.0,"Although I bought these pants the same size , they all don’t fit the same 🤷🏻‍♀️. They feel comfortable and super soft material. However, the soft material is that , soft ( weak)  . Wore one pair to be around the house for the first time and next thing I know I have two small holes on my back ( butt area) . Good prince but will not purchase these again since they break so easily it’s not worth it ."
2.0,"too tight in the toes, sizing was small.  they are cute, just don't fit."
2.0,"Looks good in the picture, but looks cheap when you see the real thing. The material is not absorbing sweat at all."
2.0,Cute but runs very small and thin
2.0,"Pretty pattern, but way too long, too full, and too high waisted.  I am 5 foot four, 150pounds And this did not compliment my large bust or hourglass figure"
2.0,What color I ordered was a beautiful orange coral colored romper what is shown in the picture. What I received is let's go hunting pumpkin. Highly disappointed in the difference of color. The fabric is soft & heavy enough so there is no see through. But the color difference is just too much.
2.0,"Nice watch, but the strap is too short for an adult wrist."
2.0,Good for maternity but not exactly as pictured. Very poofy even for me!  Nice quality material
2.0,not flattering. Very boxy cut
2.0,Basically it's 2 pieces of carbon fiber held together with a rubber band. The edges are sharp on the carbon fiber. I used it for 10 mins then hucked it
2.0,"Had to return them because even though I ordered my size, they were extra small.  I didn't even had to tried them to realize that.  When taking out of the box, they looked like little girl's shoes. Did try them though.  If you are going to order, make sure you order at least 2 sizes up.  Other than that, they were very pretty."
2.0,My kids liked em.  But after a week the metal piece fell off and I had to tie a note to tie it to the hook.  I bet you could find better ones.  Def a waste I could of used a string.
2.0,I did not like the way the shoulders fall as they look like extra pieces attached and does not look nice
2.0,"Dress is flowy and long like picture, rating would be 5 WITH mask but all I have is the dress"
2.0,"I got my money's worth. I ordered a size 5 but it fits like a 6. It's heavy and bulkier than I expected. I'm disappointed and won't wear it, but it is what I ordered.. Just a bit larger..."
2.0,"For the price, it was cheaply made and I bought another one by the same manufacturer - poor quality.  Won't buy again."
2.0,"The glasses come well packaged and look very nice; however, the inside lens coating is already wearing away around the upper bridge area. I'm not even sure if it is providing adequate UVA protection for my eyes."
2.0,"Not random colors at all, got 2 packs of grey and black. Also it's my fault I should have read description but this is for 4 pairs of underwear not what is pictured. Disappointed."
2.0,This product was a different material then I thought it would be. Was too small when it came in and was a silky material that made hair staticky
2.0,I’m quite unhappy with my purchase! Several pair weren’t even a pair there were quite a few pieces missing! I wish I could get my money back or a replacement
2.0,I wear a large normally. I would need a xl for this shirt.
2.0,"Super cute, but very short. Would work great as a cover-up for the beach or the pool."
2.0,"This  it isnot delicate at all or even pretty  . It is very heavy. The chain is very heavy and wide and it feels extremely heavy when wearing it. I am the grandmother that bought this for my 13 year old granddaughter and I wouldn't  wear it because of the weight  and because it's just not attractive. Extremely Bulky is the word. I showed it to my granddaughter and she said Grandma I won't wear this how come you picked this out for me.<br />She is a big Justice fan and has many pieces of their jewelry and they're all beautiful but not this one. The flowers of very big and they just fall all over one another. Sorry Justice you are still a wonderful company with one mistake,  this necklace."
2.0,Couldn't get these to glow....
2.0,"This was too large and awkward and the battery life is very short but the short moment that everything came together...lol...was priceless! If only for the experience, I recommend!!"
2.0,Very low rise!! not good for someone my age. Wanted these to use for paddle boarding. :( Gave them to my daughter.
2.0,Only have worn this sweater twice. I thought it was super cute. But the sleeve fell apart I. The washer and now there is a giant hole. It’s too bad because I did receive lots of compliments on this one!
2.0,"For beauty of ring and stone, arriving in a timely fashion 5 stars. 2 stars for setting is not straight. Have contacted seller, will update."
2.0,Had I known this charm was so small I wouldn't have bought it. Can barely make out what it is because it's so TINY! So disappointed.
2.0,Looks like a little kids necklace.......too fine and too small. I mean really to fine.
2.0,watch is okay but it came damaged and does not display correctly the date
2.0,Dragonfly fell off the belt almost immediately after first use.
2.0,"I bought this for my nephew who will be 4 in Jan. I bought these pjs for him at size 5t ..thinking (kids grow fast so go up a size , that’s practical right?  The best thing about this product is their logo . Kudos who came up with brand logo . The size is not true to fit ( as it states)  GO UP TWO SIZES! Seriously... I mean how are these sizes determined what grid is being used or scale or ?<br /><br />When you open the package you get a whiff of a poly plastic vinyl-y scent .  I put my arm through the leg , ( this is not a cozy comfy material .. If I wasn’t still furloughed I would’ve bought something substantial. But I’m on a budget and I guess you get what you pay for .. I’ve should’ve known ; I mean the size tag is stamped on. I live in LA ... we have open shopping market in DT LA , we call santee alley ... these are the kind of garments you find there .. actually sometimes you find  Quality stuff , at these prices . I just find it deceiving tbh, I mean it’s like surprise ! Oh uhh, let me check that order receipt again ... but it’s what I ordered . I’ve been in sales and marketing and quality control, no way would I let this garment pass .. have a little bit of integrity I guess I want to say ... without being to harsh 🙊🤔🙏🏼"
2.0,The material is not silk.
2.0,not again
2.0,"Looks better in picture, bought 3, one came broken, returned all."
2.0,they're pretty bulky and cheap feeling.
2.0,"I got this to be used as a Halloween costume, and it fit for this purpose, but nothing I would wear seriously. It was itchy and added weight. It was not flattering"
2.0,I wear an XL. Although the package says XL this t-shirt is no more than a medium in actual size. I am disappointed because it is really cute and different. Two stars because I like it. No more because the sizing is just wrong. I won't buy this brand again.
2.0,"Color wine not as advertised, it looks red"
2.0,"Pretty skirt, but I ordered Gold and it was Not gold. It was a rose gold color despite the package saying gold. It was pretty but I needed gold for the event I bought it for so I'm returning it."
2.0,"I had the HIGHEST hopes for this skirt.  I purchased in purple to wear to a symphony tribute show to Prince (RIP!).  Although the color was beautiful, the fit was not. For the record, I am 5'9&#34;, weight approx 165lbs, athletic build but not 'skinny'. I ordered the XXL based on reviews and the length was perfect but I found the waist band to be odd-if worn 'higher up' it looked weird, and if worn lower/on my hips, it caused an unfortunate muffin top. If you are skinny and have little abdominal fat, I think you'll wear this skirt well. It just didn't work for my body."
2.0,"They are cheaply made. Left shoe fits ok, right isn’t made right and the side it sticking out. I wound not recommend it. The sole is very hard and flat. They are leather and that’s nice. But I think for a little more money you can buy much better shoes."
2.0,I was really satisfied when I first purchased this but it lasted abouta week before the bottom part (2 jewels on the dangling chain) fell off. Super disappointed.
2.0,Very small and took to long to come in so I don’t have anything to wear for my bday
2.0,"Too small for anyone but a child, and thin, see through. Won't protect for anything."
2.0,Looks likes child's size. Bought the co bc I wanted it large and loose but it fits 2 sizes smaller.
2.0,"The shirt fit well but, the look was cheap and the quality the same."
2.0,Bottoms are great but top is unwearable. Very poorly design and assembled.
2.0,"I always thought I had normal size hands for a female but these gloves are pretty big. It's not a deal breaker, just annoying. The claws work somewhat well depending how loose your soil is. I get the feeling they won't last long though.<br />The gloves themselves are nothing special. The standard chap Chinese material that lasts a few weeks max.<br />I would definitely not go out of my way to purchase these but if you're looking for something cheap these might do the trick"
2.0,"The gemstone is too small. I was planning to give this as a gift to an adult but would have been embarrassed to do so due to its size. If's more for, perhaps a 9-12 year old."
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these in the XXL size, the teal and the coral. They're beautiful, and incredibly soft. Unfortunately, they didn't fit. I didn't want to deal with returning them, so gave them to a friend who is a smaller XL, they barely fit her. Just a warning for us bigger gals, these won't fit!!"
2.0,Returning this. The fit is so very small.
2.0,"Butterfly is bigger and heavier than I thought it would be. Beautiful.<br />As soon as my daughter tried to put it on, the band's came apart. We have to find another way for her to wear it. Otherwise, it's a good deal."
2.0,The watch is much smaller than the picture. I was so disappointed.
2.0,"Received it looks half wash, ashy color"
2.0,You cannot grab an actual thorn on a rose branch like your photo indicates. It does penetrate through the glove. I feel the price is too much because of that.
2.0,Only a child can fit this unless you have a very small wrist this was horrible
2.0,It looks nice but a couple of the plastic things were broken upon arrival. :-(
2.0,"These pill and pull like crazy, making them frankly difficult to wear more than a few times."
2.0,"Cute style and fits well due to the adjustable straps, but it is very thin and the muted orange color is a neon orange color in person. Would have maybe kept in black or a darker color if it hadn't been see through, but I'm returning the orange color."
2.0,"Very cute, exactly the style and colors I was looking for but my kid has a big head and this was large enough to fit his dad...."
2.0,Lasted a year with moderate use. I own now than one watch so this hasn’t been worn every day. The inside of the band is not made of good material. I do not believe it is real leather. If it is it isn’t durable leather. I love the pattern so I’m pretty disappointed in the quality the original Leather band the watch came with lasted at least 5 years
2.0,"Fit fine. Fabric was heavy, very heavy. Too much for summer."
2.0,"This is not a plus size swim suit, the top looks flared and loose on the model but it was tight and unfaltering for me, i'm a size 22."
2.0,I was really excited to get this but after wearing it for a few days it has turned my skin green and the metal is turning green and awful brown color! I would send it back if I could! I love the dangling butterfly/bee looking thing but not when I'm green at the top of my piercing and under my belly button!
2.0,"They look great, they're comfortable... they fit everything from my RayBan type earpieces to my thin ""Euro-looking"" metal ones... now if they only didn't keep tearing after just a few weeks of normal wearing they'd be perfect...for the record, I lead a pretty mellow(vs active) lifestyle ... I don't play ball, I don't go on undercover assignments for the special operations community...In short there's nothing I do that puts undue--or even mildly due-- stress on these--yet these are the third pair that ripped as I was taking them off...guess third time's not the charm it's supposed to be"
2.0,"The battery seems to last several minutes - maybe as much as 10 or 15.  After that, the odd shape becomes only the next most annoying thing as the battery starts dying."
2.0,The arms go to a totally different size. None of the dress I ordered came with return labels.
2.0,"The size is great,  but the buttons on the side will not stay fastened.  Kind of a dissapointment"
2.0,"This is more of a wrap dress and if you move the slit you can see all the way up to the top of the dress. I got a M, and I am 5ft5 and 132lbs and its much bigger on the top part and the sleeves are too long. Will be returning ."
2.0,I had to return it because the face is tooo small.
2.0,It fits way too small.
2.0,"Background: I'm constantly trying to evolve my personal gear storage system. I just upgraded to a new DLSR bag with all kinds of pockets and compartments for storing things. What it was missing was a place to securely put my sunglasses with having to worry about cracking or scratching. The Como seemed like it was the solution.<br /><br />Reality: On the second day that I owned it, the strap connecting the case and clip came completely unraveled.  I'm not even sure what started this. I just set down my bag and the whole case was hanging by a thread.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm hoping that my experience is not indicative of the quality of this case. The actual case seemed sturdy enough. Not completely crush proof but close enough to protect your glasses on the outside of a bag. The clip is cheap plastic, that I would have eventually replaced with a metal carbiner.  The strap is sewn into the case, so there is no way to replace it if it fails."
2.0,Beautiful watch that arrived non working. Alas disappointed
2.0,Love these leggings but they’re smaller than I expected.
2.0,Doesn't fit like described
2.0,"Nothing else to say except it is cheap looking.  Again, you get what you pay for"
2.0,Just didn't fit right at all. It was SUPER short and I'm less than 5'...
2.0,Pretty. Smaller than I expected
2.0,Shirt is to small & short for a 4x and is made of very light material
2.0,It's a Lil smaller then it looked online but it's ö k
2.0,About half of them will be stuck open and won’t open and close freely.
2.0,It's very pretty and lightweight but way too big!
2.0,While the fabric is very soft it did not hold its shape very long during travel. The knees and butt areas stretched out quickly. The overall look was dumpy. After first washing the fabric looked worn out already.
2.0,This hat was huge and mediocre quality. Not recommended
2.0,"these sunglasses have very nice,soothing lenses,but only a kid or someone with a shrunken head could wear them!"
2.0,"I am giving it a two stars because it is beautiful, but there is no support. I have nursed babies so I need a bra to keep everything up where it belongs, this bra stretched throughout the day. I would not recommend this bra for bigger chested women who need the support."
2.0,"I ordered a x large becuse of the reviews of them being to small... I am 5.7 weigh 145 and the x large was super small could not even pull the up. Gave to my friend who is 5,5 weighs 115 and they fit her.. So order like 4 sizes to big if you are ordering.. They are cute though"
2.0,Nice yet beads popped when trying on.  Daughter refuse to return it.  Not worth the price.
2.0,Can't keep my shoes clean on the inside.
2.0,"I like the color of these and they were good for the price but they disintegrate easily, both on my head and when washed."
2.0,"I thought the necklace was shades of pink from the picture, but its actually pink and corals mixed together. I wore it to work and received compliment on it"
2.0,"I returned these. Material felt like a thicker twill (like a lab coat), was much stiffer than the model picture. Color reminded me of hospital scrubs. Just wasn’t flattering."
2.0,"While these headbands are a nice fit for my average sized 8 month baby's head, they have a distinct odor to them that also permeates my baby's scalp for a few hours after taken off.  It's an offensive odor that gives me headaches, and I can't imagine my daughter likes the smell.  I'm hoping to hand-wash them and get some of that nasty scent off of them, because they are truly adorable and a good fit.  So disappointed about that foul odor!!"
2.0,this was too way...too big
2.0,Fabric is very clingy.
2.0,Terrible arch structure
2.0,"Straight out of the box...PERFECT, AMAZING.  I'm 5'7, 145lbs, order the XL for the roomy fit like the picture because I love flowy shirts over top some skinny jeans and wedge booties.  That being said...DO NOT WASH IT.  It was ruined the first time I did.  The threads started to unravel, and it shrunk 3 sizes.  I can't wear it now.  Such a huge disappointment to me.  Good thing it wasn't very expensive.  Still....what a waste."
2.0,Wanted to like the dress but it didn't fit correctly.  The material was thin and looked cheap  ( it was). Sent it back.
2.0,This dress was super cute until I put it on! I'm 4'11 and a bit busty. But not enough busty for this dress! I figured it would hit right at the knee as most dresses do but this came to just about my shins. Was not impressed with the dress overall!
2.0,"I found this product searching for Disney costume jewelry. With this price, I expected the material to be some sort of metal. This is plastic. It has a very small length of chain and is made of very cheap material. I would only suggest for children. I am only giving it two stars because i should have realize upon looking that it was made of cheap plastic and is not what i was looking for. Earrings are clip on."
2.0,They are great for summer they are thin and light but they are way shorter than they look or say and if you have boobs the shirt barely reaches your pants
2.0,Unless you’re under 40 years old I can’t see why anyone will wear a shirt that short is definitely a crop top doesn’t look like that in the description but it definitely rises above your navel. way too short. Sleeves and collar nice length
2.0,"I received this as a Christmas gift and it looked and felt great! I went to slip it on one morning and the band snapped apart where it was apparently glued, flinging my Apple Watch to the tile floor… see photo attached. Buyer beware and make sure your AppleCare is still current. SMH."
2.0,"Pretty and cheap earrings, it was expected they lost their shine quickly. Was disappointed that after wearing them for a day though they have taken on a blackish appearance"
2.0,it is not made well seems like someone made it at home not like the stores have
2.0,Meh...does nothing. Too big
2.0,Although they are comfy and warm gloves they are very large. Also they stopped working on my phone a week after purchase
2.0,"Could have used an XS, but it doesn't come in that size. Very big and baggy."
2.0,"Flimsy, hard to clasp together"
2.0,"I guess you get what you pay for. Mine is not dead and everything still works except for the left side buttons. The IMPORTANT buttons! The light and the mode. I wanted rugged and cheap and I've put this thing through the test with hiking, fishing, kayaking, swimming, and everything in between. Still ticking but those two buttons not functioning is a bummer. Of course daylight savings is around the corner so I guess I'll be useless for half the year. Lol! Like I said, you get what you paid for. It is cheap, it is waterproof, both in fresh and saltwater! But alas, the buttons failed me. :("
2.0,This headband was really uncomfortable to wear. The letters are also super small - you can barely see them in your hair. Returned!
2.0,"They're cool shoes, lots of different colors and settings. However, one of the shoes stopped working and charging TWO days after they were opened. Kind of ridiculous. We will be returning them and ordering a new pair."
2.0,"The fit of this dress was fine, it fit how it was supposed to. The fabric is thin, and kind of a slinky texture that I think could be susceptible to static/clinginess. My big issue is this: The pattern of the dress is upside down (which it is in the picture, so I should have noticed this), on all sections of the dress but the ONE back panel that is rightside up. It makes it look kind of weird. I think I'm sending it back."
2.0,"The top look very nice , but when I tried to  fit in, the button was broken.<br />I am so disappointed!!!"
2.0,It was wayyyy too small
2.0,"Decent boots but you get what you pay for, the sides have ripped apart already and I bought these in April 2018"
2.0,Fabric is rather thick for a slip. The fit is on the small side. I would not order again.
2.0,"It was HUGE, came down past our Knees and the sleeves were way too long.  Vendor made it easy to return it though."
2.0,"Cheapy and wrinkly material. Soft and comfy, but not worth buying."
2.0,"The color was beautiful but it fit weird. In a picture it looked better than in person, which wasn't saying much. I bought it for a graduation shoot and ended up ordering a different yellow dress. I'm 5&#34;4, 130 lbs and I don't think I had the chest to really fill this dress out up top. Such a shame. It was the perfect length on my legs to still come across classy though!"
2.0,"Nice, but run big"
2.0,"This bracelet is very lightweight and pretty.  However, the tennis bracelet broke after the first wear. The material is very cheap.<br /><br />I really like the bracelet.  I have purchased a 2nd one because first one broke.  Now the 2nd one did the same thing."
2.0,"To tight in the toe , nothing worse than breaking in a flip flop"
2.0,too small and way shorter than expected
2.0,"I purchased two for my boys and they both unraveled at the sleeves within two washings.  The shirt also runs small, even ordering a size up to account for the ""girl"" label."
2.0,"Didn't work for me; it was too small and uncomfortable. It seemed to me a quality product, however. I was happy for the free shipping to and from, also."
2.0,I purchased the xxs and they was the same size a Nike small. Looks good but the sizing is way off.
2.0,"Very disappointed in the shirt, it is not made of flannel fabric, can’t really figure out what kind of fabric it is but it’s definitely not flannel"
2.0,Way to large - not as pretty / detailed as the picture
2.0,These are like hard erasers on nylon cord.  I can't even put them on so the emblem is showing outward.
2.0,"My daughter ordered this just for a fun skirt to wear to school. It meets the dresscode requirements: goes beyond the fingertip length, hits right around the 3""(ish) above the knee (she's not tall), and she liked that it has the attached bloomers or shorts or whatever you want to call them. The first time she wore the skirt, at the end of the school day, the wimpy zipper on the skirt was dead. She put the skirt on in the morning, went to the bathroom once during school hours - so that's twice using the zipper - and then the zipper stuck when she tried to get the skirt off. She came to me for help. I pulled it downward (as you do with sticky zippers, and the entire zipper fell off the skirt. She and I just stared at it for a minute. The skirt itself was great. Good weight, good material. But the zipper is pretty important."
2.0,"Ipod Nano 8th Generation fits well in this case, but the headphone jack is on the bottom. The cutout for the cable on this band is on the back, which prevents the Ipod from fitting into the pouch properly."
2.0,"This seems like a well made bra. It has two layers with front closure and front zipper. For someone not so well endowed, this would make a good bra to avoid uniboob. However, the sizing is definitely asian sizing. I bought the large, which is the largest they have and according to the size chart it would fit me. There is no way that it would fit me. I could not get this on. I doubt that even a XL if they had one would fit."
2.0,"I bought these for swimming laps, but because there is no draw string in the waistline they just fill with water while swimming and become a water parachute even though the elastic on the waist is good. If I dive in the pool, they get pulled straight to my ankles, my wife and kids thinks it's funny, but its not good for swimming... Otherwise, the quality and fit are good. These would make good shorts for poolside, but not actually swimming laps."
2.0,"I was having issues between my legs - it was too tight and I am 5'7"""
2.0,It’s a cute top but the rainbow is like plastic so I’m afraid to put it in the dryer because it will peel and melt off
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:b152cfe90901449f6c28e269e1613e7a]] Poor material, completely see-through and thin. I can literally see the microscopic hairs on my thighs poking thru the thin material in contrast to the white, let alone my undeewear. The pattern absolutely does not flow across the waist band area like it presents in the product photo. Not even the same color quality/saturation, whatever. I was really looking forward to receiving this romper. I'm super annoyed with its quality and will return it.<br />It would be great if it were more of a cotton material, thicker with less sheerness, at least more design across the waist like the product picture to camouflage the cheapness and imperfections. Great style, and design..very disappointing execution and reality."
2.0,"I’m a 36DDD and I ordered these to give my shoulders a break from bra straps. I wish I hadn’t. They don’t give support at all and the padded inserts make weird impressions on my shirt, you can literally tell there are inserts there. Completely unflattering. Additionally, they are cheaply made… thread hanging off the item everywhere. I ordered an XL thinking it would be a little tight, ergo would offer some support. Nope! The material is comfortable though. I’ll keep them to wear around the house but definitely can’t wear them out! If you don’t have small breasts or implants, these will NOT do you any favors!!"
2.0,No give yo it<br />Was tight order up a size
2.0,"Aesthetically pleasing, and the materials seem to be pretty good quality. Does not keep time worth a lick."
2.0,"This is a very pretty outfit and flannel is warm BUT it's not flexible in any part that mattered. I have kind of a larger bust and had a very hard time getting it over that. There is a zipper but it's for the stretchable part of the material not the stiff flannel part.<br />Once I managed to squeeze into it, I literally had to cut myself out of the flannel part! It was the only way to get it off. Such a shame!<br />If you do get this I'd suggest getting it at least two or three sizes larger."
2.0,size is too small to fit to 38A.  Should consider buying bigger size one.
2.0,Bought a large...fit about like a small.
2.0,Material poor quality.  Needs to have thicker material with thicker hem. Not moisture wicking.
2.0,Fabric was thin
2.0,Love this braclet but it broke it a few days...  but it looks amazing on
2.0,I bought this watch a month ago. I noticed last week that it does not keep time properly. It lags pretty significantly and I have to reset it every day. It looks nice...but its not very functional.
2.0,Really thin and chain felt cheap it was on. Just didnt look as pretty in person as I thought it would. Someone else may like it but I just didnt care for it.
2.0,Has a funky &#34;Made in China&#34; smell....I'm hoping after a couple days airing out it'll go away.
2.0,Did not come with the matching mask - 🤭<br />Please send and I’ll give a 5 star rating!
2.0,"I don't like it.<br /><br />I'm not a bag snob. I'm not a girly girl. I own one cute-ish backpack that I also don't like that much. Most days it's just me and my pockets. I bought this because I'm going on a trip soon and I expect to do a lot of walking. I needed something that would hold my huge phone (6&#34; Lumia 1520), my small wallet, and maybe one other random item. This bag does that, so that's a plus. The strap was easy to adjust and it was comfortable on my shoulders (fyi that's why I don't like the backpack).<br /><br />What did I expect for the price? I don't even know, but even though I got this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, I still paid too much. The color is cute (light brown), but the material is awful. It looks so cheap. The craftsmanship is bad. (Again, what did I expect?) And the smell. I let it air out for two days before I carried it out into the world. I've had it for 11 days--can still smell the chemical-ness of it.<br /><br />If functionality is your only concern, then by all means grab this up. It's just that to me, the bag is too unattractive. Then the manufacturer had the nerve to take Tory Burch's logo and slap it on the bag. Great; now I look like I'm trying to pull off a horrible attempt at a knockoff crossbody. Doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Shoot, I'm judging myself for carrying it."
2.0,The pants are okay I m 5'7 and 165 pounds so it would seem like a L would be an okay size . Feels like bubble gum stretch jeans . and they are not highwaisted as seen on model nor are they of the strong jean material. My Seamtress will have to work with this .
2.0,"They run small, difficult to remove and can’t really tell there’s padding in them. I use for cutting grass, to deaden vibrations of the lawn mower. Should’ve bought real bike gloves from a bike shop where I could’ve seen and touched them first."
2.0,I didnt know how it was. My fault.
2.0,"I was attracted by the price of the dress, however very disappointed in quality.  It appears cheap...wouldn’t wear as a cocktail dress as the lace indicates.  I bought a small and medium, one in black (shirt sleeve), and the other red (sleeveless) so I could compare.<br />I am petite, but have authentic build<br />(5’4, 120 lbs. 34-26-36).  I can wear size 4-6.  These dresses are made for a very slim straight figure to hang properly.  Not made for the curvy figure at all!  Returned both dresses.  If you want a quality dress look to Adrienne Pampell and Eliza J on Amazon."
2.0,Good quality rings but the wide width traps moisture and induces sweat. They gave my husband a nasty rash after being worn a few weeks.
2.0,I was unhappy about the shirt coming plain with no buttons as pictured
2.0,"Strictly speaking, this is not a swastika. It's inverted and would need to be flipped the other way to be a swastika. But good luck explaining that as whatever life is left behind after your beatdown slowly decays in a landmass."
2.0,Very cute but the material is rough.
2.0,Cool idea that lasted for about a week.  The item is very thick and pushes the ears outward at an uncomfortable angle.
2.0,"You can't see the lights on this wig at all, they're all on the underside and not very bright."
2.0,It broke within an hour of my putting it on  I had to return it.  I liked the look but it just came apart
2.0,After wash it looks so ugly w/ much wrinkles
2.0,"and I have average wrists.  Otherwise, it is very pretty.  More for a child than a woman's fit."
2.0,"Dress came with fabric firmly lodged in zipper. Took half an hour to finally remove it so I could even try the dress on. The lining in the top is placed in a very unflattering cut. I would recommend cutting out the lining entirely and wearing a better fitting slip underneath. All in all, too much effort for a simple dress."
2.0,It did not for as expected
2.0,"Ordered a XXL - the top was too small, it is made to be very form fitting and tight, not flowing like the picture."
2.0,"Brand name on JERZEE knockoffs, Really?  Smaller then actual size."
2.0,smells and the stitching looks like it will unravel any moment
2.0,Ripped in seconds. Disappointed.
2.0,Cheaply made. Sized for child.
2.0,Bought three. One for me. Two as gifts. One broke after wearing twice.
2.0,"I mean, it’s funny, but it’s really too small to fit an adult man’s face. Description says it’s universal, but I would say this is more for a small woman or large child."
2.0,Had to stop using them. Distorted my vision regardless of every attempt to adjust them.
2.0,They are comfortable and have a great seal.  But after two laps they fogged up.
2.0,"Beautiful bag! I shop Rothco pants all the time, my buddy has a different Rothco canvas bag and it's lasted him two years... But this model didn't even last me a month!!  The site claims it's heavyweight canvas, and a durable bag, but as time goes on the swivels separate and break into pieces, the straps rip off, the zipper tabs are becoming unsewn. NOT meant for anything but a light load. Beautiful design concept, it's a shame it won't last. I messaged Rothco to suggest reinforcing these things, and they supposedly passed it along. They're a good company with a good reputation, but I was really bummed out about the quality of this beautiful product."
2.0,Disappointed in this bracelet. It looks much Fuller and thicker than is. It is very thin and soon. Get what you pay for
2.0,My items looked like they have been used. Things were out of placed and dirty. The brush hair was all over the box.
2.0,"These run small and are very very narrow at the opening. Also, the buckle for the opening is sewn on so, you cannot open the shoe any further."
2.0,Thin and sizes run very small. Not made for a D cup!
2.0,It is very hard to get on n off if your knuckles are swollen. It also turned my finger green after being in salt water. However if none of these issues happened I would love it. It is a cool design.
2.0,"I like this dress but the arm holes were a little to large for me, showing part of my bra.  The fabric and fit of the dress are nice, but returning because of this."
2.0,Beautiful patriotic jewelry but one of the hearts came off the earring the first time I wore the set
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:6c429368823bd8b3712613c6dd7133]] They say ""100% Cotton"" in the listing. Nope.<br /><br />Cupro is rayon—a semi-synthetic made from cellulose (like from cotton). It's not cotton. It's also not supposed to be really expensive, or environmentally friendly, except that you can make it from materials that would otherwise be wasted. The chemicals involved can apparently be bad for the environment and dangerous for workers.<br /><br />So especially with the high price, this just seems like greenwashing: making something seem eco-friendly that might not be, just to sell it to people who care but don't know the details.<br /><br />All that said, the ""Sierra"" pattern I got is pretty, so I can't just give it one star.<br /><br />See my video review for more."
2.0,"After 3 months of using these gloves the ""touch"" fingers stopped working as the material faded away and these are definitely NOT wind proof!"
2.0,Nice ring perfect size but turns finger green because of the fake gold
2.0,the size is more huge that the normal is.
2.0,It isn’t a sweat shirt as stated.
2.0,1st one I purchased got lost. The replacement was the same closure type as the picture but more like a standard watch band which just looked weird. Only lasted about a week before  the pin sliced through band and was useless.
2.0,Colors look nothing like the picture or maybe they sent the wrong pair<br />Very disappointed
2.0,"The watch face is huge, the &#34;leather band&#34; is not very flexible so it is hard to put on. The pineapples are pixlated, and not as cute as I had hoped. The worst part? The watch face is gold, but the clasp is silver. No, no, no!"
2.0,"Fit ok putting them on, but are too tight around upper ankle for several who tried them on. Gave them away"
2.0,"This item seemed well-made. But after just 2-3 weeks of wearing it, it split. I dI'd not get it wet & wore it only during the day. Idk why it split so easily. :-("
2.0,"Sent me a purple stone instead of the blue.  Also, I did not like the chain that was on it originally and it fell off the better chain because the loop was not pinched together enough.  I think they should have used a solid loop.  Nice amulet - structure not thought out."
2.0,I loved the skirt until the zipper broke. It was cute while it lasted
2.0,Size Large is more like an small
2.0,One of the necklaces already broke.
2.0,"This picture looks like denim but you get a thin blue blouse-like material instead. It’s a pretty color & comfy, but not a denim dress like I wanted."
2.0,"I was anxiously awaiting for the mask supports to arrive to see of it would make a difference in the comfort level of using my masks. I was so disappointed when I got it! They are so small that it barely covers my mouth! (and I don't have a long face at all...more of a small face). When I put it on, I couldn't talk because the bottom of it would end up in my mouth!!! So, sadly, I have to give this a thumbs down."
2.0,Package damaged.
2.0,This product is very cheap looking and looks like something you'd get out of one of those vending machines you put quarters in..
2.0,"Beautiful backpack, but the first one came with broken ring and they replaced it. The second one came with bad strap. But I repeat... Beautiful backpack."
2.0,I ordered the large. My niece was the only one that could wear it.  She's a size 0
2.0,"I ordered an S, and it felt like a XS."
2.0,"The first time I wore it, it popped right out of my lip. I also only received nine of them, but I wont be wearing them anyway"
2.0,"We got these as a gift. I hate them. I wish we just got cash instead. They are a cheap material, not a soft cotton sock. Also, the grips are difficult to put on and use with sneakers."
2.0,"Smelled like a dessicant packet, was WAAAAY smaller than I expected. The denim was nice though. Buttons were turds. Way too small an aperture for removal, plus the reinforcing wasn't wear you need it to maintain a nice seem. Or to prevent tearing."
2.0,"I didn't like the cloth in the  bottom portion little disappointing, it doesn't look the same as in the picture."
2.0,Fabric is rough and not soft.
2.0,"The watch is lovely, but is NOT blue. I ordered the blue faced watch, but received a purple watch."
2.0,"Finally got around to wearing the black pair today as the weather is now appropriate for long socks.  When I went to take them off there was already a hole in the ankle area.<br /><br />A big Thumbs DOWN to this product, especially for the price."
2.0,"These are ok maybe for crafting, but I wouldn’t hand them out to kids as we had planned. I got these for my daughter, and she immediately developed a rash everywhere she put them that lasted all day, even after washing her face.<br />I also had hives around my mouth where she put one on me, and it wasn’t on more than a minute.<br /><br />The adhesive is strong but the fibers aren’t attached well. We discovered this when she put a mustache on her stuffed animal. The adhesive stayed out with a vengeance while the fibers peeled off when we tried to remove it. I had to carefully uproot it with a fine toothed comb."
2.0,"The fit is good, the color was more of a coral than red (see photo). Have a red shirt next to it to compare. I was really disappointed in the color.  The fabric is thin and somewhat see through. There was a card thanking me and said gift was enclosed in the package.  There was no gift??  Giving a 2 instead of a 1 because I really like the black one, very comfortable"
2.0,"Pretty, but only from a distance.  Plastic &#34;jewels&#34; are not glued on well."
2.0,I've bought multiple pairs of dragon googles. These lenses were not fog resistant. I've never used dragon googles that fogged this bad.
2.0,I bought this less than six months ago and it's already broken twice.  I fixed it myself the first time and it broke again this morning in a different place.  Very disappointed.  In the past Speidel has made quality watchbands but this one is just not up to par.
2.0,"The pin backs are centered in the largest part of the wing, which unfortunately means that they are extremely off weighted and want to sit vertical, tip down no matter what material you put them in. Only way to get them to fit like they do in the photos is to put some stiff material behind the collar to hold the pins in place. I cut some card stock and that seemed to work OK but really shouldn't have to go through all of that to get them to work as intended. The pins look fairly nice though."
2.0,too too large
2.0,"Very disappointed, no black lace that is shown in the photos, this was supposed to be my Christmas shirt (my husband, daughter and I were wearing Buffalo plaid) and it’s too late to find anything else. The size of the plaid doesn’t match the photos either, and the size just “hangs” funny, the only good thing is that it’s soft but overall very disappointed in my purchase...."
2.0,They turn green after a while and may irritate sensitive skin!
2.0,"I'm 5'8, athletic build, ordered a small and it fit like a medium/large. Returned.<br /><br />Material is soft and comfy but also kinda cheap looking."
2.0,"This tunic is a beautiful color, but sizing must run really small because it's WAY too tight. I won't be returning it because I need to original packaging/shipping bagto send it back, which I unfortunately destryed in the process of opening everything. Instead, I will be asking a younger cousin of mine if she wants the 2 that I purchased, and will not repurchase more. Fot aside, the material is very thin; outlines and colors of bras and undershirts can be clearly seen through the material (even light colors!) and that is a pet peeve of mine. It's a shame because I really like the pink and grey colors of the 2 that I bought. :("
2.0,The screw top fell off and was lost
2.0,"It was great quality, perfect fabric, looked just like the picture. The reason I gave it a 2 is because the biggest size offered literally fit me like a small. I'm a big chested, 6 foot 4 man, so I expected maybe a little small, but this thing barely went over my scalp and only covered half my stomach. Looked just like the picture, but not."
2.0,I would have given these pants 5-stars.  I love them - soft cotton fabric and light and comfy.....BUT they cannot be laundered or dry cleaned and must be hand washed.  Hand washing is the only reason I am returning them.  I don't have time for hand washing casual clothing.  Too bad.
2.0,I have plantar fasciitis.  Hoped these would fit but way too painful.  Very thin shoe
2.0,I returned it!  Did not like the fit at all but the real problem was that the lace was apart from the seam before I tried it on.  Not well made at all.  Could not even zip the thing up and as someone mentioned in another review the legs bunch up.  Anyway back it went.
2.0,if you're really small it would probbaly work fine. im not big and yea it barely covers anything. at least it wasn't a huge waste of money only $8 but still..
2.0,"Looks super cute online, but did not for like I expected."
2.0,"I wore this all day at work, and after a while it starts to hurt. Also loses it's magnetism after a while. Got my septum actually pierced and I'd recommend the real thing rather than this. This product is good if your wanting a new picture tho and planning to take it off immediately after"
2.0,Not as warm as I would have liked. A little big on my head.
2.0,"Loved the necklace , but the stone fell out in less then a week . Returning product."
2.0,This was sold as a Harley Davidson product and was sold at a higher price. No where on the article is there anything that indicates it is from Harley Davidson.
2.0,"Sent them back, they have an awkward fit and too small"
2.0,sold by the singles.. never came<br />across that before when its displayed as two.. i guess its one of those situations when you have to read the fine print..  well played!! i honestly say this has never happen to me before.. haha you probably shouldnt display the pics as a pair tho cause most ppl arent going to read the fine print of gauges and its only going to lead to bad reviews
2.0,Fits like a child's mask
2.0,The olive green pair had a hole in them.
2.0,"The sleeves are so long and baggy and the wait is tight, very strange fit. I will not order again"
2.0,material not as expected. very cheap looking and didnt look cute as on photo
2.0,"Suuuuper cute swim suit. Soooo not made for large-breasted women. Practically zero support in the top. You can tie the halter as tight as you want, but you'll only end up with a crick in your neck and some poorly-supported girls  Pink in person is much brighter than I had expected from the thumbnail and the waistband is quite a bit tighter than the rest of the bottom, which wasn't particularly flattering. I really really really wanted this to work but it just wasn't meant to be. The search continues."
2.0,I found this boot too tight around the calf.  I was afraid to zip it up because I didn't want to damage the boot.  It seems fragile and flimsy.  The product shipped promptly and packaging was in good shape.  The actual product wasn't well made.
2.0,Very baggy through the sides and top. Tight through the hips. I have an hour glass shape and it doesnt do anything for it.
2.0,Very soft and comfy but these are see thru and can see your underwear thru them when you bend squat and lean over<br />I’m 147 lbs and wear size 8-10 women and got the plus size leggings and they fit good but pretty thin.
2.0,I would definitely not purchase these again. I received 10 out of 12 packages. Two of the packages are missing pieces. To top it off they are much smaller than expected.  Very disappointed. Two stars is because they arrived on time!
2.0,"Looks cute but like the other reviews..cheap material, stitching coming out,laces super long , and I would have to air them out for days to get that cheap china factory smell out."
2.0,"After the shipper sent the wrong item and took quite some time replacing it, I am pleased with this item's appearance and it looks great on my bedroom dresser.  However, I have had it stop working, with no indication, and find I have a dead watch when I needed a live one!.  Not sure whether it is a power spike, loose electrical cord or what; but, a program/power indicator light would have been ideal.  You can have the item plugged-in, with the rear switch turned on, and still not have it wind your watch if you do not program it using the inside panel.  I think a power spike may wipe the programming, so a UPS/APC or surge protector is in order.  Very sensitive and the programming gets wiped with voltage fluctuations.<br />UPDATE:  Surge protector did not help.  Will try connecting to a nearby power backup for my PC and will revise my review; however, this is beginning to be more trouble than it's worth.  Probably due to cheaply made electronics.<br />UPDATE: Backup power supply worked, but after one year one of the motors died and LED control panel display dimmed considerably.  Poor quality."
2.0,"Nice soft fabric but terrible quality. Multiple rips (from turning over while sleeping and seams/straps ripped), I think I only wore it twice before having to throw it out."
2.0,Good for price.  Doesn't support as well as I had hoped!
2.0,"Love this suit! Color is great and fits as expected. I love the ruffled skirt.<br /><br />Update, I originally rated this 5 stars but I had to give it 2. Once I washed it, it looked partly bleached. I did not use any bleach whatsoever to wash this. Totally ruined the suit. Did not get to officially wear it, only tried it on. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
2.0,The shirt is not the same as the picture
2.0,Terrible fit. Way too big
2.0,"Arrived on time but would not recommend.  😣 fabric very light, I like heavier."
2.0,"Not as pictured, the length is way above knees closer to waist  and long n back returning"
2.0,"I like the color and design, but it is way too small.  I ordered a XXL following the size chart and it is way too small"
2.0,"The product is stated to be semi-precious stone, when in fact it is acrylic. Didn't even get to try it out, because it was already crumbled when I got it."
2.0,Colors match the photo but the scarf is 4 times too big
2.0,Too hard to put in.
2.0,"Have had these for like two months and they have already started ripping at the seams. They were pretty comfortable, it's a shame the quality isn't very good."
2.0,"Fit true to size, but definitely see through while bending/squatting.  Fabric was kind of scratchy, not smooth and buttery like other leggings I’ve tried.  Might be fine for lounging around, but not what I was looking for to wear for working out, ended up returning."
2.0,Too short to fasten
2.0,Overwhelming musty odor! I placed it in a spare room to air out and now the room smells musty. I have now placed it in Lanai hoping the musty odor will disappear. Compartment  and size perfect. Hook to hang with is small and plastic. Inside zipper pulls feel flimsy and are small.
2.0,Waaaay cheaper looking that the picture. Reminds me of a workout top as is.
2.0,"It has so much potential to be cute, but the fit is weird. The waist is tight and the elastic is twisted. It’s a very full skirt with a lot of folds and must be steamed constantly. I wish I could have some of the material cut off and taken in, it’s just a bit much."
2.0,"I love the belt, but the way it buckles is etremely awkward.  The buckle isn't attached to the belt and falls off easily."
2.0,"I purchased this for a costume as the Joker. When I received it and put it on, I could easily tell that it was not tailored at all and looked very boxy on me. The scrunchy sleeves fell at a strange length between 3/4 and full length, so I cut out the scrunchy things and rolled the sleeves. In the end, I did not use this blazer for my costume because it looked frumpy, and was a papery material that I was not satisfied with. Size wise, I am 5'4&#34;, and weight 140 lbs. I would not recommend this to anyone. That being said, the color was nice."
2.0,to small for my bubble head...
2.0,Nice length but just looks cheap.  Maybe just because I have a small chest but the neckline looks a little childish.
2.0,Feels great but I have 2 pairs with the middle seam ripped and the rest have holes and will be ripped soon
2.0,This coat is NOT warm. It’s really a rain coat. Very misleading
2.0,Didn't get but one earring when it was suppose to be two.
2.0,Fit till it's was washed even to the specifications of the tag now it's to small order big and wash before worn
2.0,"I bought this after ready Big the reviews regarding to get a size bigger than what you are......welllllllll. I go for a large in clothes due to hips or chest on a daily basis. So I got an extra large and yeah it won't stay on, it's actually too big. That's really my only issue and it's stretchy too! The material is fine even if it looks a bit off regarding the picture but thank goodness it's not see through like some experiences I've had haha.<br />Either I've lost weight for it's best to get your size.<br />Hope this was helpful😁"
2.0,It's ok. The oyster was a little hard to open with the small plastic tool. The chain of the necklace very short and the panda on necklace not made good.
2.0,Too much hype
2.0,Did not liked it. It does not looks good i look like i was very fat. Not good for plus size peaople like me
2.0,Quality should be better ..
2.0,"I love the idea of it, but the pendant and chain made my neck breakout in a rash. Which made me super sad because I did like it."
2.0,cute design.  little to no compression
2.0,"Didn't seem to be athletic cut, ran large on size"
2.0,Ordered a XXL and it was more like a med/large. The top barley fit and the bottoms were way too tight in the waist area. For the price the durability seems good just the sizing is way off.
2.0,It’s was too big. I bought this for my 4 year old.
2.0,The quality is good..got it on time ..<br />But it ROLLS DOWN...
2.0,"I got 2 different brands of underwear in the same size.  The other ones were too small, these were too big. Go figure."
2.0,Too small and when I wanted to exchange the seller indicated it wasn't worth it and to give item away and they give partial refund.  Ordered 1 size larger than usual.
2.0,I bought this for my daughter. The sleeves were too tight on her and we ended up returning it.
2.0,"I ordered these because they were highly rated on a consumer website and they were lower in price than the Jockey underwear that I usually buy.  The way the consumer website described the product, I expected it to be as comfortable as the Jockey underwear.  When I tried them on they were not very comfortable and they didn't feel high quality.  They felt like they would start running up on me after a washing or two.  From now on I will stick with the Jockey underwear.  You really do get what you pay for."
2.0,"Too small, and shrunk 3 inches after washing"
2.0,My husband wanted a softer wearable wedding band. We had a buy a different brand the silicone was not very strong
2.0,"The pictures aren't super accurate. I like how these beads/crystals will go with anything, but they just aren't nearly as pretty in person as they are depicted online."
2.0,"Out of the bag this shirt looks great. I ordered XXL. It goes on fine but on me, I could feel the shirt hugging my body. So it isn't true to size. After the first wash, now it is like a yoga shirt. Hugs my chest and body. Since I'm a typical midwestern chubster, it's tighter than I would care to wear. For those of you that are fit or muscular, or appreciate tight fit, this is another article of clothing to enjoy. For me the fat guy, it's already been donated. Bummer."
2.0,clasp difficult to close
2.0,I used the sizing chart. It was way too small. Returned. Don't want to guess.
2.0,Zipper broke within a few weeks of normal use. Quality could be better.
2.0,"Sadly, I had to return this dress. The lace is very beautiful but it was too small. I would have left more stars if that was the only problem. But it is a side zipper and we could not even get the zipper down at first because the top of the zipper was sewn into the seam and you couldn’t even see it. We struggled to wiggle the zipper down and nearly gave up but we were finally able to get the zipper down so I could try it on. If this had the zipper at the back it would have been better."
2.0,"Wish I could give these a higher rating, but I ordered an XL, and the hang tag says XL, but these pants are a Large. I'm so disappointed because I really wanted grey camo leggings and had ordered what I wanted, but I wasn't sent what I ordered and now the grey camo isn't available in XL. Extremely frustrating. I can't tell you how they look on, but these are soft and they do have nice stretch."
2.0,These capris were terrible. I have two other pairs and these are made from a completely different material. They’re thin and have already torn.
2.0,I thought they were cotton tank tops.  They are silky feeling. Tight fitted.
2.0,Ordered this dress as an option for a New Year's Eve party. Oh. My. God. The neckline just looked like a bunch of loose fabric that didn't have any styling to it. The length was weird on me (I'm 5'7&#34;) and it ended up hitting just above the knee. It grabbed in odd places. Immediately threw this back into the box to return.
2.0,I was really looking forward to this swimming suit because the top looks so cute. The material was cheap the top fit and looked good and is wearable but the bottoms are a different story. The bottoms offer little coverage and are uncomfortable maybe it's just not for me or my body type but I'm was disappointed in the bottoms.
2.0,"I loved this dress, but did not want to have to wear adhesive bra to wear it. I feel like a dress with sleeves you should at least be able to wear a strapless bra with. Wish it had a panel in the back like it did in the front. It was also backward on the sides without it. Would be much classier with a panel.  I returned"
2.0,not my favorite purchase. It is a little short for me to wear as a dress even with leggings. Th print is nice though so I will prob wear with some jeans and a crop jacket. Glad I read the other reviews and up sized my order or it would not have fit.
2.0,Too small<br />Pretty color
2.0,"I almost gave this 3 stars, simply because it IS 'okay' - but I'm beginning to feel it's not something I will work at wearing for long.  I say 'work at' because the nylon fabric is stiffer and coarser than I thought it would be, as well as thinner.  It's about 1mm thick.  I've been wearing it for a couple of days, and the material is rough and stiff against my skin, which is unpleasant.  I'll keep wearing it in to see if it softens with wear a bit, but if it takes much longer, I don't see myself using this watch band much, which is disappointing, because I do like the color.<br /><br />The hardware is good quality and low-profile -  rounded-off smooth flat edges.<br /><br />The buckle pin holes, 2 days in, show some signs of pilling or fraying around the inner edges, though not only just in the pin holes I was using while wearing the strap - so I'm not sure they weren't there & that way before I got it.<br /><br />Similarly, I'm a bit disappointed that the round-cut end (opposite end from buckle) isn't as tight (well-sealed) and fray-free as I'd expect.  Again, just a couple of days in, and I can see where fraying will increase and the end will get fuzzier over time, fairly quickly.  It's just not as well sealed as it could be.<br /><br />Though the nylon is 1mm thick (I measured it), it somehow feels thinner than another nylon strap from another manufacturer I recently purchased which also measures 1mm.  I can only attribute this perception of &#34;thinness&#34; to the stiff and coarse, slightly 'cutting' feel of this fabric on my wrist.  (The other 1mm strap I'm comparing it against struck me as thicker than 1mm, simply due to its relative comfort and 'softness' in comparison to this one.)<br /><br />Due to its 'starched-fabric stiff' feeling, this watch strap isn't conforming to my wrist to get comfortable the way that I want.  If it ever gets there, I can tell that it's going to take a while to do so.  I wonder if I'll be able to stand giving it that long.<br /><br />Anyway, not worth my $20.  If I'd paid $10 for it, I wouldn't be terribly unhappy.  If I'd paid $5-7 for it, I'd probably be fairly satisfied."
2.0,"Styling-wise this watch seems to be a great value but I had issues with the watch keeping up with the time and then it just stopped... I did reset the watch and it worked for another day then was slowing again...<br /><br />Hopefully, you will have better luck than me."
2.0,Nice belt but wrong color. I wanted a black one
2.0,"These were too small for me, I wear a size 9 shoe. When I would remove my foot from my shoe the toe cover stayed behind in the shoe."
2.0,"Killer Lil' Dress!!  I needed it for a modest, comfortable dancing dress for a wedding! It was perfect and checked off ALL the boxes! I ordered 2 sizes to get just the right fit! Yes, looks great in person! Love the Perfect A Line fit!  I'm 5'2 & 115 pounds so I was between the XS & S.  The S looked a bit large and frumpy on me.  The XS fit like a DREAM but that darn zipper is SO WONKY!!!  LOL! Thankful it busted in the first try-on and not on the first dance!!!!  Seriously a great dress but had to send them BOTH back! That is one strange zipper... I can't even explain what happened but like the other girl said I had to crawl out of the dress!  All THAT said, this was one of my first attempts at Amazon Clothing and it was VERY EASY & COMPLETELY PAIN FREE to return them both!!  THANK YOU AMAZON - Not afraid to try Amazon again. But terrified of Miss May's Zipper Issues!!! ;-D"
2.0,"bought this for my friend ,, three days of use ,, it broke.<br /><br />it didn't fell, wasn't hardly handled ,, it simply ... BROKE !!"
2.0,I’m probably going to return it. As soon as I tried it on it was stained. I haven’t even had a chance to wear it yet.
2.0,Smaller than I thought but it's not bad
2.0,Fit like doll clothes and I missed the return date due to an illness.
2.0,Material not of good quality.  Will be ok for a few time usage.
2.0,"The design of this handbag is cute but I am afraid the quality of the handbag is not so great.  I received my order yesterday and transferred my belongings from my old handbag to this on. I used it today and realized that the zipper does not function properly. In my first attempt to zip the handbag, the zipper got jammed and off track. I was able to unzip and open the bag back up completely after working with the zipper. However, now I cannot use the zipper because it's broken now. I will just use the latch on the handbag. The handbag also had a strong chemical smell to it when I first opened my package. I let my bag air out in another room before I cared it to work, but if you get close enough to the bag you can still smell it. I guess it will wear off eventually. Would I purchase this bag or recommend it? I am sad to say no, I would not.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
2.0,"I went of of the size chart and decided to get a medium. The medium is way too tight and short- I need a large. The material itself is very &#34;scratchy&#34; and, in my opinion, not comfortable."
2.0,Shirt was way small. It was too short & too tight. Returned!
2.0,"Size is not true to an actual size L, more like a M so order bigger!"
2.0,Too small especially for a mom bod.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress!  In the photo it looks great on the model, however when I received it the first thing I noticed was how heavy the fabric is.  It's very pretty, but it is a very heavy, stiff fabric that makes the skirt really stick out away from your body.<br /><br />Secondly, the arm holes are huge!  I have bigger, muscular arms for a woman, but you could see half my bra through the arm holes.<br /><br />Third and most importantly for me, I am 5'9&#34;.  The skirt was still a little below my knees but the defined &#34;waist&#34; of the dress was about 2 inches below my breasts so the big, stiff skirt jutted out from there and looked ridiculous.  I needed the waist of the dress to be a good 5 inches lower than what it was because of my height.  I am so disappointed.<br /><br />I did wash the dress hoping that it would &#34;loosen&#34; the fabric up a little and make it so it doesn't jut out so much, but no such luck.  Because I washed it I can't return it so instead I will be donating this dress.  Hope someone else can wear it be happy with it."
2.0,"Nice idea, but if you put it in a large barrel type bag, it will tip over and spill.  Not worth the trouble."
2.0,The dye in the scarf rubbed off on my white pillows.  I haven't had that happen with other silk scarves before.
2.0,Mesh sides both torn already
2.0,"Dress fits large, order size down.  Material feels like craft ribbon, not attractive or comfortable."
2.0,"I realize for $19.99 I shouldn't have expected much, but these earrings were a bit disappointing. In the ad  photo  the tiny CZs appear to sparkle. In reality, they are dull and not very exciting. I'm keeping them because they are pretty, just not eye catching."
2.0,"I got these for my daughter when she was 6 months old, the way the boot was shaped her foot wouldn't stay in it! The boots is shaped curved and not a lot of room. I got the size as directed but basically had to shove her foot in it. Not because it wasn't the right size but the way these boots are made! So I wouldn't buy again.. especially for the price."
2.0,"I was quite disappointed with this purchase and will be returning it.  The material is not too bad, although rather stiff.  But the main problem is that the points that contain the pockets are awkwardly high up on the pant, and hang poorly.  It creates an oompa-loompa effect that is certainly not elegant.  They are comfortable, but not stylish."
2.0,Do not go by the size chart.
2.0,With reluctance I purchased this product not knowing if it would actually help the swelling and stiffness in my hands. To my surprise  it actually helped. When I would forget to wear them I noticed more stiffness and swelling in my hands.The only problem is the clasp comes undone frequently. I have purchased three and lost two.  I probably won't purchase another because of the clasp.  I wish they could put a better connector on  on the bracelet because I would purchase another but they're too expensive to keep replacing on a regular basis.
2.0,"The material is so thin, Paper towels are thicker  than these shirts."
2.0,Small near lower part of shirt but cute
2.0,The boot turn around the front strap is way too small to allow my foot (size 14) to enter the boot. Otherwise the boot is exactly as expected and shipping was prompt.
2.0,It falls off your head because there is no back strap.
2.0,I love the top but the bottoms are made rather cheaply and were huge. I ordered a small.
2.0,"It is my size but the opening for shoulders is narrow, I just got one arm in. I'll have to make an extra opening in the front par to get in."
2.0,Just took out of the package... Disappointed very cheaply made. Way too big for my girl as well.
2.0,"They say 6-12 months, but they still fall off of my son's feet and he is 12 months old. He's average size for his age. Also the velcro has given up after only 4 months."
2.0,Zipper messed up first time he had it on. I messed with it and works now.
2.0,Much lighter than navy blue. Shallow pockets and hood. Buttons we're very loose.
2.0,"I am a size 10 mens shoe and ordered these socks because they say they cover my size and larger! The socks are very small and would fit very comfortably if I were a size 6 or 7. I ended up throwing these away because they were so tight that they made my feet swell by mid day, and I have no medical issues that cause edema."
2.0,They dont fit on the sunglasses I intended them for.  The connection pieces are far too narrow.  I even tried them on my ray ban sunglasses that everyone has and it wouldn't even fit on those.
2.0,Skimpy cut.  Looked like a kids hat on my husbands head.  Returned.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:b0f9d0df54d1a2bac8f94edb8eef21e6]] Never worn anything like this before. It was relatively easy to figure out. Super comfortable and surprisingly kinda warm. I left a bunch of pics so everyone can see their operation. Material feels slightly scratchy. Not a big deal if your not super sensitive to textures. I'm using these for rollerskating and cosplay.<br /><br />*edit* I went rollerskating, I tend to sweat and I always wear a tank top. I have boney hips and the draw a string will grind into them slightly. It's certainly not a deal breaker but something to be aware of when being active in these. Pulling them up slightly higher is an easy fix.<br /><br />*2nd EDIT* (Washed my clothes)<br />These bleed, a LOT. Everything in my wash is now lavender. Ruined roughly $50 worth of clothes and towels. See photos at end of review, white towel used as reference."
2.0,The screw ball wouldn’t stay in place
2.0,"Let me start by saying that these are very cute boots, but.. they are  extremely wide in the calf area. I am 5'5&#34; 125 lbs with wide calves and they are big on me. Perfect for someone who might tuck jeans etc.. in them."
2.0,"I ordered a large because I like things lose. It was way to tight, especially around my bust...  I am really disappointed because I really like the fabric."
2.0,Made very nice but runs extremely small. Ended up returning and finding pair at Dressbarn for less money that fit much better.
2.0,"Fit was great as far as length and waist (I'm 5'2 and 103 lbs) and the color was pretty, however this skirt was way too puffy for me. It was almost costumey with the amount of puff going on. I could see possibly for fancier events, (maybe that's even a stretch honestly), but not what I was going for or expecting. I felt like a little girl playing princess dress up to be honest. I sent it back."
2.0,I love the ban. When switching bands the peg to lock the band into place was lost (it fell out). Thankfully the band comes with one extra peg. The reason for my low score is the construction of on bands broke - can't fix; using crazy glue not a good idea. I like the band (and it being inexpensive) that much I just ordered a new band.
2.0,The colors goes off after 2 or 3 weeks.
2.0,The dress is much longer than pictures and the chiffon is heavier. Doesn't have the light feel like in the picture
2.0,"Seemed like good quality at first, then with only a few months of use the buckel broke."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:ac0edcd6300e14ba50973cafa8ef44fc]] There small to small
2.0,Broke after second use. the Bag came apart at the waist belt. disappointed.
2.0,"Really cute set. The straps are adjustable, but unfortunately the plastic to hold the strap together was broken on arrival."
2.0,"Almost all of these earrings were glued together crooked...  They were for my daughter so it didn't matter that much, but they also just fell apart when taking them out of her ears.  The metal is so junky it turned her ears black after just a couple hours.  Cheap is what they are and not worth it..."
2.0,Way too snug - would need to purchase large to make this fit.
2.0,So the pattern itself is exactly like the picture but not the colors. That throws everything off. What appears to be black through the skirt is actually blue.  It doesn't make the dress ugly but its definitely not what is represented and that is just not acceptable hence the low rating. I kept it for work otherwise I'd return it.
2.0,do not fit
2.0,"After waiting a long time, the mask I received was as pictured but is very small: I do not think it will fit over a regular adult size head. There is very little stretch in the neoprene material. It also stinks of chemicals. I’m going to air it out.<br /><br />I would not bother buying this."
2.0,Good quality. But falls out all the time. Doesn't stay shut.
2.0,"The hole on the earring back is off center, so it doesn’t hold onto the earring post. Poor quality!!!"
2.0,"Looks cheap, scratches easy, and it’s the same price as the original glasses!"
2.0,Hard to read.  Colors just drift into each other
2.0,I gave it away. Wayyyyyy too small<br />Really nice top but sizing is horrible
2.0,"I like how these polyester shorts feel very cool during the summer.  However, there is one thing which I hate!  Everytime I need to squat down, I hear the stitches in the bottom part of the shorts pop open.  So now, I can only wear these during my sleep, I cannot wear them during the day because I clean and mop the house during the day.  I always will need to squat down to get underneath furnitures and etc.  I don't think these shorts will last two weeks if I keep squatting down daily while wearing them."
2.0,I think it runs a bit big .... material is ok but a bit on the thin side. If you dont have curves this dress just kind of hangs on you
2.0,"Adorable but it came with no button holes on one of the straps. Runs big. I wear a L or XL top, 14 dress, and a L was too big.  Also, pretty long. Would have to roll up to wear (5’4”). Also straps button from the front and hand down in front not behind the bib of the overall."
2.0,"They feel great, but my heal is always slipping off."
2.0,"I could barely for my foot into these and I have regularly sized feet. Looked weird, too. Skip these, way better products out there."
2.0,I wish wide sized were offered.  Good looking slipper but a little small
2.0,the fabric and cut does not fit like a normal leo
2.0,Loved the style and the weight of them but unfortunately they cracked soon after getting them.  Many compliments.  People could not believe they were not prescription.
2.0,The strings for the arms are cut strange. They don't stay where they are meant too. Overall shirt just hangs funny.
2.0,Sole separation within a months time Indoor use only....this goes on my see ya list ..(wont buy again)
2.0,2 big
2.0,Wow..Womens Large looked like a childs large! I guess I will give it to my 11 year old niece..🤷‍♀️
2.0,"My twin girls love their boots. Unfortunately the boots are not well made and started falling apart, particularly inside the boot."
2.0,Shipping alone took over a month when it should have been two days. No apology or attempt to rectify the issue.<br /><br />It gets two stars because of the poor manufacturing. Loose threads or extra long from where it wasn’t trimmed. It will need very careful handling when washing.
2.0,"For AAA pearls, they looked very dull and cheap. Definitely not a AAA luster.  I returned them."
2.0,Cute item but somewhat fragile. Arrived with a broken piece. This brand not as good of quality as Bejeweled.
2.0,"I had such hopes for this skirt. Idea is good execution is not. Zipper is cheap and has no clasp to hold the top of it together so you can count on that splitting later on. The waist is very unforgiving and smaller than expected. It would make more sense to give it a small amount of stretch. My waist is smaller than my hips. The waist fits very tightly but then the skirt bulges and it just does not look good. The fabric is super cheap too, it is simply poorly made. Glad so many were able to make it work but I absolutely could not wear this."
2.0,The band bunches up at the point where it attaches to the watch. It should  be narrower.
2.0,"The gloves are not form fitting and come off easily, especially when handling food.<br />I consider these a complete waste of money"
2.0,"Lightweight and soft, but elastic shredded with one wash."
2.0,flattering but see through when I bend over
2.0,"I hate to say this. I loved these belts. But I guess the price being so low I get what I pay for. I won’t lie. I wore one daily Monday to Friday at work, since the day it arrived (just before Xmas) till Friday when the bucle came clear off. And I’m unable to fix it.<br /><br />If not for this I would have had a belt for life. Now I’m waiting to see what happens with it’s partner."
2.0,"We purchased two of these necklaces as christmas gifts and both look very nice, however they do not seem to be put together very well.  The Celtic design on the top of the key is barely attached and I am sure that if it happens to get caught on something like your coat or a scarf it will be in two pieces in a matter of seconds."
2.0,"(A) I hate writing negative reviews. (B) I was so upset with these because they were SOOO much better than a pair I'd bought off the shelf at Walgreens. They fit well and felt more supportive than the store-bought pair. Today, on my third wearing, I tried to adjust the stocking by pulling it up and a hole appeared in the heel. I'm still wearing them and will find out the next time I put these on if the hole turns into a tear/run."
2.0,Waist not as stated.
2.0,"I wear size 14-16, XL and ordered a XXXL it fits like a US M/L not happy about that.  Otherwise the product is decent."
2.0,"I LOVE the purple color.....but that's all I like about this jacket.  What I don't like:<br /><br /> - the sleeves are too short.  I have long arms and the sleeves are at least 2 inches above my wrists.<br /> - the pockets are not where you can easily rest your hands.  They are up higher on the sides of the jacket.<br /> - the ruffles are silly looking.<br /> - the seam on the inside of the sleeves where the outer ruffles are attached is very scratchy on my skin.<br /> - The metal loop used to zip and unzip this jacket is too heavy for the material and causes the neck to not hold it's shape.<br /><br />If you have short arms and wear something on your arms to keep the ruffle seams from scratching your skin, you might like this top.  It kind of looks like a top a nurse would wear - round neck, but no lower pockets to hold stuff.  It went through the laundry cycle alright and came out of the dryer with no noticeable shrinking or fading."
2.0,"Oh so itchy. I liked the color. It fit a bit small, I wanted a little loose and this was not. I though about ordering a bigger size but the fabric is so annoying I know I couldn’t make it through a day wearing it."
2.0,"Trying a second pair. First pair I had, the lenses got very messed up. Looked like a break in a seal so all around the edges of the lenses was permanently clouded up."
2.0,These arrived with the lenses cracked in half. They are extremely light weight.
2.0,Too small and dont like the white seams..
2.0,Looks shabby and cheap
2.0,"These pants are paper thin, the material is synthetic and not nice to touch, and the size is too large. The fir looks so bad and puffy with a tight ankle, it’s like Aladdin’s pants. I plan to return them"
2.0,"These shoes are so cute and seem to be very well made.  BUT, the size is way off.  Why would the seller go by the age of the child rather than the shoe size????  Not all 2-1/2 kids have the same size feet.  Have to send them back as they are the size that would probably fit an 8 year old (not a 2 year old)."
2.0,"Definitely not for larger breasted women. I’m 5’4” and 190lbs with DDD cup size and where the shorts of the XL fit perfectly the bra top was another story. The coverage was decent, but the actual straps were so thin that where you’d like them to at least pull your chest up a little to look cute the weight of my chest almost seemed that it was going to break the straps they were like floss in terms of thinness and quality. I did get a pair of cute shorts out of it though. So that’s why it’s a two star and not a one."
2.0,Made for a petite person but very baggy
2.0,"Very stylish. Enjoyed wearing them for a few weeks. I’m pretty careful with my sunglasses. Sadly, they broke last week. I was hoping these would last longer than beach vendor sunglasses, alas, they didn’t."
2.0,This fabric feels weird. This dress is way shorter than I thought it would be. Never again.
2.0,"I purchased the Floral17 style and I’m returning it. The dress fits good but the colors look terrible, the top and bottom do not match. The top of the dress is made when faded fabric while the bottom of the dress is made in a different fabric. I’m ordering the gray in a replacement to see if hopefully that one will look better. I’m 5’2 (170lbs) 36DD, typically wear a size 14 so I ordered an XL which fits good so just hoping the color is better the next time around."
2.0,"The waist area of the pants was a perfect fit for an XS but the thigh area is huge and gap-y. Definitely not XS dimensions, id say closer to a small or medium fit honestly. If you have a small waist a bigger thighs, this would probably fit perfectly but if you have skinny legs, I would not buy it. Really sad about this because I thought the leg area would have a tighter fit :("
2.0,Cute but it’s a lot shorter than I expected. I won’t wear it :/
2.0,"Beside the fact that the package took over a month to arrive, the sweatshirt looks nothing like the photo.  The color is a Pepto pink and it is not of the quality in the photo.  While the photo makes it look like the fabric is slightly distressed, it is not.  Boxy and unattractive."
2.0,They hurt every time you put them in or take them out. OUCH.
2.0,"This dress, while pretty, but was not like expected. The underskirt was too short so your but sticks out. The entire dress was completely see through as well. Great if you want lingerie, but I thought I was a dress so I got a refund."
2.0,It was just an awkward fit... maybe it's just meant for skinny people
2.0,"I saw the other reviews that said these ran small, so I bought a size up. They were far too big for me. Also, the legs are too long and there's no way to roll them without looking odd."
2.0,Looks cute but the buttons already fell off. It wasn't even sewed on properly. you get what you pay for. very very cheap.
2.0,"I ordered a 3x, the shirt fits like a child’s large, extremely wrong in size"
2.0,"It's 2 sizes too small, so that's super disappointing. Also pretty thin for a sweater."
2.0,"Too long, skinny legs, bad fit!  If you are 6'3 and have the skinniest legs in the world then these are for you!  I returned them.."
2.0,I did not like how short the pockets are. They are not very deep and I do not like that very much.
2.0,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. I thought it looked pretty cute and she’s a red head and you wouldn’t think it but she looks good in yellow. She is wearing 2t right now but the shirt was too snug. The shorts fit perfect which is what I was more concerned about. It doesn’t look flattering so probably won’t get much use out of this one, oh well. Just wanted to warn everyone you might want to get a bigger size then usual."
2.0,Cute shirt but received damaged and it was to small. Not true to size
2.0,washed shirt in light bleach and it fell apart
2.0,I'm really disappointed there wasn't more variety with the charms.  Too many duplicates - there were 20 starfish and 19 Eiffel towers!  The charms are made well but I was really hoping for more variety.
2.0,Pretty colors but way too large!!  Will wear one as a pendant
2.0,Tarnished my ear
2.0,Super cute but FAR too small even wth the correct measurements.
2.0,"Eh. Too stiff from the start, only one side is decorated, and not what I was hoping to get."
2.0,"Besides x-large wasn't true to size (too small) I was disappointed that the fabric was NOT soft to the touch as advertised.  I expected a more soft, plush material.  Not worth my time nor expense in sending it back."
2.0,"Had these barely a month and the “cork” layer is feeling off the sides already. Also, when I remove them from over my eyes I can feel the toughness of the faux cork along my ears. They look nice, but are obviously low quality for the price"
2.0,Very cute but i only wore it for 2 hours and most of the lights stopped working. Only 1 works now.
2.0,The shear parts DON'T stretch AT ALL (sobs) If u got thicc thighs like me they won’t work. If you are slim and willowy you will look simply smashing.
2.0,I only give this seller two stars because ONLY three out of the six necklaces weren't defective. The Evil Eye on three of the pendants was  not correct so why would you sell something like this to someone??? The bracelets were fine but the necklaces were a mess this is not okay.
2.0,This jacket is super thin fabric/stretchy fabric that doesn't look pleasing on anyone. I ordered a few sizes up and still was way too small could barely get it zipped up.
2.0,I'll give them to kids as gifts
2.0,Not a good pick if big busted with a an average waist. Had to send back. They did refund money but tried to talk me out of it.
2.0,"These pajamas definitely run large. The material is clingy, so it's kind of nice to have the looser top, however, the shorts are so big I have to pull them up to my rib cage.  The first time I put them on, I definitely felt a cooling sensation. The first night I felt like they helped with my hot flashes, but they haven't helped since then. I wouldn't buy these again."
2.0,The look and functionality would have been great if the lanyard did not break the second time I wore it.  My amazing intern sewed it back together.
2.0,"As an adult the mask is too tight for me to wear.  The horns need something to fill them, the latex isn't thick enough."
2.0,returned the HOBO Kimi because it wasn't big enough or space in the wallet. I am now waiting on my refund. I am looking forward to more specials on the different styles.
2.0,Not what I expected (in a bad way) completely unsatisfied.
2.0,"From the photo it looks red red but it actually more of a burgundy/magenta red, and grinch is more of a pea soup green. I wouldn’t buy again"
2.0,"Texture was ribbed. And I am short, however I felt like the side pieces were pulling my top half down and lower half up. Also, VERY tight across chest and not in a cute way…"
2.0,Its a cute skirt until you put it on.  The material is super thin so I had to get a slip.  Also the waist in the picture looks stiffer and more defined.  the actual product wasn't as clean or sharp.  I honestly think I wouldn't mind pay a little more for a better quality on a skirt with in this style.
2.0,"I could not see the dial face in the dark.  I could not tell what time it was in the dark.  The tritium tubes are too weak to be useful TO ME.  Maybe light sensitivity by owner would make a difference.  Otherwise, the watch appears to be nicely made and has a great band.  Handsome watch."
2.0,They were beautiful for a tall person or someone with a longer neck.
2.0,Unfortunately I put one on my phone about a week ago and it just broke and the pieces rolled all over my house.  My son is in a leg brace after surgery so I had to make sure every piece was picked up.
2.0,My original review was favorable but every chain broke within a week 1/2 of purchase under very light usage.
2.0,"The zippers are cheap to begin with and broke after a short time. This vest should definately  not meant for salt water use, everything metal is rusting"
2.0,"Thin material, cheaply made, just okay..."
2.0,"I bought the gold/bronze one and the color had almost entirely worn off within 2 weeks. Now, rather than gold/bronze, it's a dark purple. Otherwise it works fine but I will probably switch out for another brand later."
2.0,"Thin Material not of good quality, got my hopes up for nothing but hey sometimes it a hit and miss."
2.0,The chain broke already I'm disappointed and would like a replacement.
2.0,Comes with very little instructions. All the parts are very small. Very cheaply made.
2.0,Although I ordered the large bands they fit like a small.  Pretty sure they sent the wrong size. Quality of bands are good though.
2.0,Gold color wore off very quickly. Larger then i thought but pretty.
2.0,Wanted to like the dress. Not a good fit for big chest. Empire waist cuts off my boobs. 5’6” 40 DD 215lbs. Length is good. Material is somewhat see through but feels heavy enough.  Odd gathering of material in the back. This is a razor back NOT like the photo shows.  Disappointed that I got something different than photo but it does say in the description. Read reviews thought I’d give it a try.
2.0,I was disappointed in the size.
2.0,"I've got mixed feelings about the items I got.  I only spent $12.50, but I was expecting the 1928 brand rather than the Classic 28 jewelry I got.  The necklace was the 1928 brand, but the others were Classic 28. They weren't quite the quality I was expecting."
2.0,Product looks great on model but in person it looks more like a short robe.
2.0,Fabric somewhat clingy around stomach area.
2.0,Really pretty but the chain is so thin it broke :/ I kept the charms tho so I just bought another chain but it’s still annoying so be prepared or just be careful!
2.0,These tanks shrunk to a mid drift after one wash.
2.0,"Doesn't sit on your wrist like in pic it scrunches together, still nice though."
2.0,cheap looking and much larger than i had thought...
2.0,"The fabric is fairly cheap and thin but but it’s fairly cute, if you order the right size. Get at least one size up for sure. I got a large (my usual size) and it’s fits slightly smaller than medium."
2.0,Too long. Husband didn't like it.
2.0,"Material is elastic but not strong... very thin & seem easy to tear, would not recommend"
2.0,The dress fits great! But it came with a huge hole in the seam in the back. I will have to return it or get out my needle and thread.
2.0,pointless and didn't help at all just painful to wear
2.0,"Finish and material are nice, however it's is extremely fragile... Even the slightest snag and it will unravel in long lines across the shirt..."
2.0,They do not hold up my heavy DDD breasts
2.0,A couple of mm bigger than 5/8 they are beautiful. Sadly I have not been able to wear them at all :'(...
2.0,looked nice when I got them but almost all the buttons broke when I washed them.
2.0,if you have more than a B cup this is NOT FOR YOU. I ordered an XL and didn't even cover half of my chest. I wear 36D. RETURNED.
2.0,"There are multiple vertical seams running along the front and back of the dress.  These seams stick out into the inside of the dress.  I found these to be too irritating to my skin.  If you have sensitive skin like me, this might not be the dress for you unless you are willing to wear a cami or slip underneath it.  The fabric itself is soft, but the seams are not."
2.0,DOESN'T LOOK A THING LIKE ON MODEL very heavy fabric and the cut is on my neck not my cleavage wouldn't spend anymore money on this brand
2.0,Item was very small. Can't fit an adults finger
2.0,"Disappointed ive worn the shirt 2 times and washed it 2 times now I'm sitting here looking down at it and it's peeling, when I pay almost 30 dollars for a shirt I expect it to last the quality of this shirt is horrible too bad since the griffin was actually pretty nice....also be warned this maker makes several other graphics and I bought a few of them I expect they all will do the same by next month"
2.0,"This item arrived with the ear cuff squashed and misshapen. It's not bright gold, as pictured. It almost looks tarnished. I probably won't wear it. Oh well. You get what you pay for."
2.0,Sleeves way too long on me.
2.0,Thin and cheap looking... tangles and sheds a lot. Not worth the $14.
2.0,"So far 4 out of the 12 have broke the first time being used and within a few hours, Im not really mad since they were cheap but I wouldnt buy them again, Im gonna go to walmart and get some that will not break as easily."
2.0,Really thin and cheaply made. Strings left hanging all over. But it is what it shows-ish
2.0,Quality not well
2.0,This Bag is small and not enough space to put your things inside.  The pockets are narrow.  The inside lining is made of stiff cheap plastic. I do not like it.
2.0,"Battery died already, the low quality is expected with low price"
2.0,"Cool style, but too small. All our recent Amazon sunglasses purchases have come kid-sized."
2.0,"Liked these and their look but they were a little tight on my ears.  When I tried to bend them back slightly, the clip broke off."
2.0,Before I bought this shirt I looked at the size chart provided and it said that an XXL was a 52” chest. I have a 49” chest. When I tried this shirt on the arms were very tight and the must have need 5” of space between the front closure. Very very small!
2.0,"not warm at all. it has holes, so the wind goes right through."
2.0,Hanging off and tripping me. I wear a 10 1/2 but these ended up to be a &#34;hanging&#34; 13.
2.0,"Way too small even for a woman’s hand, rips easily but comfortable.  Essentially disposable after 1 use."
2.0,The medium size is too tight . I am petite small I ordered the medium thinking it will be good enough for third trimester and is super tight and umcomfortable.
2.0,The chain broke the first time I wore it. :-(
2.0,These glasses broke in less than a month.
2.0,"The sun glasses are a good product but did not help me with driving at night.  These was no improvement in my ability to see during night driving.  Glasses have metal rim, nice case , cleaning cloth and a soft bag."
2.0,Thinner material than expected
2.0,"Looked nice, but he weld between the key ring connector and fob broke after about a week."
2.0,Cheap & tacky looking. The rhinestones are poorly glued on.
2.0,"The product fit was not good. The pants were ok until they split around both thighs. I understand Asian sizes are known to be smaller, but there should be xl and 2xl sizes for more customers."
2.0,Bought this as a birthday present for a friend. She loved it and was going to put it on immediately. Chain to clasp ring is broken. She handed it back after I promised to try to fix it. Not the greatest birthday present after all.
2.0,It could've been thicker and a little more fitted
2.0,Nice gloves but the inside was way too scratchy for my skin. Had to send them back.
2.0,"I really really wanted to love these leggings. I’ve wanted a pair like this for a long time so I jumped at the opportunity but unfortunately I won’t even be able to wear them the way I want to. They’re very compression-like. They’re super tight and pull everything in like they’re supposed to. They were pretty comfortable to have on and fit like they should. They feel thick and durable, not exactly the softest feeling leggings I’ve ever had though. The biggest issue is they are see through. I used a piece of white card paper to do the squat proofing test and didn’t even have to turn the flash on to see the paper and my underwear in the front and the back. You can see everything. I was so disappointed because I loved the color so much and loved how compressive they were. But you could literally see my whole butt in the back. My husband said there’s absolutely no way I could ever wear these even if I was paper thin and not be able to have the issue of people pointing at me. I just wish they were thicker."
2.0,It’s a cute bag but I wouldn’t say practical it’s very deep but thin and the straps are small so the bag constantly was falling off my shoulders. I returned it I’ll keep looking
2.0,"I've worn this bra 3 times, and on the third time, the wire popped right out of the front. Disappointed."
2.0,Update: I had given a rate of 5 stars to this black dress because I had bought the red one... It's after I worn the dress then I realized that the material is different than the red dress that I previously purchased... The red one is a thik material and it is very dressy and class..unlike the black dress. It looks and feels so cheap it shines like satin not really dressy.<br />I'm so very disappointed to this black dress I feel like I've been scamed and cheated by the company(LAI MENG'S)  while thinking that I was getting the same good quality buying the same product.... Shame on LAI MENG'S they reaped me off. And trust me guys if you want to the differences buy both dresses red and black. And then come and leave experiences about both dresses and you'll see what I'm talking about!
2.0,"so its cute in the picture, but when i got it it looks nothing like the picture and is made of very cheap fabric that rips very easy"
2.0,"They arrived quickly and were in good shape. They are not soft, persay, especially on the inside where you'd expect it to be a bit softer and fuzzier even if the outside wasn't.... but as my title says, they are....sweatpants. They are made of non-restrictive material and it goes on your legs. Definitely fulfills that requirement. I bought a size up, which was a good choice; that aspect is comfortable and the elastic band doesn't cinch my waist uncomfortably, and they still stay up. So, cool?<br /><br />I say they are cheaply made because of:<br />a) mediocre material - THIN (i.e. not warm....so..no sweating in these pants) and not really soft at all<br />b) the rainbow on the side is made of a ribbon material sewed on, instead of soft cotton sewed in like I expected. I suppose I didn't examine the pictures closely enough. But still. cheap.<br /><br />I am not returning them because I am thoroughly lazy and because of COVID, not leaving the house anyway, so avoiding the post office / who will see them? But be forewarned: these are aspirational sweatpants. If you want more than conceptual comfort, look elsewhere."
2.0,"Purchased for my 6 year old daughter after reading reviews of others purchasing for 4-7 year old kids.  It's super cute and my daughter loves it, but the arms hang almost to her feet."
2.0,"The design is nice, but the playing of the metal is very sloppy, not smooth. They just don’t have the shine I was expecting"
2.0,Got a medium (I’m 135lbs 5’8”) and it fit fine but completely see through. Even with high underwear it wasn’t wearable
2.0,"AT FIRST, THE EARRINGS LOOKED REALLY NICE FOR ABOUT A WEEK OF WEARING. THEN STARTED TO FADE. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT 🙁"
2.0,They holes would come out of the belt.
2.0,I believed that oversized meant a little bigger than normal. My head is large but these glasses are huge. They have to be meant for someone with an exceptionally large melon!
2.0,"Besides over priced, I had to eat it because my spouse didn't like it.<br /><br />The product description is unclear.  I actually thought I was buying popcorn, not just a bag of topping.  Also the topping is for just one serving of popcorn which I had to furnish.<br /><br />Sorry, but would not buy again or recommend."
2.0,Glove are too small for adults. Made for kids. I tried to wear it and they are way too tight. The wire is also annoying because it sticks out.
2.0,Very cheap feeling. Words were cut off inside the heart.
2.0,Like design and length but it was way too small even though I ordered a large size
2.0,"I am doing a re review.  After owning this bag for over a month, I wish I could return it.  This bag has started to come apart, ( the canvas lining).  The hardware is cheap, really cheap, its hard to buckle the straps.  I would avoid this bag.  It could have been great if they spent a few dollars, or cents and added a little more quality parts."
2.0,Did not fit the watch its advertised for
2.0,Weird fit in the boobs
2.0,The hat was ok but the way it was bent to be shipped caused it to be permanently bent weird and so it looks really weird on. It's even hard to get it at an angle that works for gardening because it either isn't blocking the sun effectively or its in your eyes.
2.0,"Pretty color, but way too thin."
2.0,Too tight... had to return
2.0,The fit is nothing like the photo. The design is too large. It does not match up to your face like in the photo. Nose is too big. Lips are on your throat. Really wanted it to fit like the photo. Misleading.
2.0,Dress had a hole and a stain. Cute but you get what you pay for.
2.0,the ring was too small. A size 8 is not a size 8. Setting and tigers eye did not meet expectations as to looks.
2.0,They are comfortable but when I take them off they both come off
2.0,"Not worth the money, product runs small"
2.0,"If you’re looking for something you can use one day and then throw out this is your lucky day! Might as well get a plastic bag, cut a couple of holes in it and wear that. I washed it a couple of times and the plastic lining which kinda looks like insulation started coming out, like completely peeling. It ok if you want cute pjs for a specific sleepover or something but if you’re looking for so sometimes fancy you can wear in the long run this won’t be right for you. Also the color is more like a highlighter yellow rather than a canary."
2.0,"I am 5’6, 150 lbs. slender average build. I usually wear large US. I ordered XL due to Chinese sizing. Sleeve cuffs about 1 inch longer, chest-shoulder about 1.5 inch to wide-folds or creases show, I have about 38-40 chest. I have a more muscular chest. No buttons on front of jacket-meant to be worn opened , no outside hand pockets, 2 inside pockets on left side. The Alligator pattern on sleeve cuffs deeply imprinted on them. The collar and back and front of jacket,  the Alligator imprint on leather is very feint. For most part looks like real leather, my test is to use a lighter and see if it burns or melts. Fake leather melts. Haven’t tried it on all parts of the coat yet. Sleeves seem thicker and stiffer than rest of the jacket. Sleeves are a slightly bit tighter. If you work out and got big arms, bit tight. Wearing thin shirt shouldn’t be an issue, thick flannels or sweaters then it will be noticeable. My 2 star rating based on slightly irregular fit and low quality imprint of alligator faux skin on rest of jacket. Ok as general overcoat, comes to my shin between knees and ankles. Would have preferred side hand pockets on jacket. Pockets inside not deep. Enough for cell phone or wallet. The sleeve section seems thick and synthetic or plastic feel, rest of jacket seems real leather. Noticeable difference. You will notice the suppleness difference between sleeve and rest of the jacket immediately. I would say most of the jacket is real leather, the sleeves are not from the feel. Came slightly damaged, back of my leather slightly scuffed. Using it as a rain overcoat windbreaker."
2.0,"Looks awesome, feels nice...but doesnt stay tight."
2.0,Not shiny and was already tarnished/darkened on the inside. Returning it so it doesn't turn my finger the same color!
2.0,"Way, way, way too big. XS isn’t an option and the small is more like a medium or large."
2.0,Cute dress! Bought for my sisters winter formal but cuts EXTREMELY LOW- lower than what’s pictured- her entire bra was showing in the front to the point where we had to cut some of the fabric and sew the straps so it could come up a bit
2.0,What you see in the photograph is what you won't get.<br /><br /> Chain girth is super thin and has a dark twinge to it although it does sparkle in the light.<br /><br /> I own a lot of silver and this is not a quality chain but it goes with a stainless steel pendant that I use. This will be a chain that I use in 3rd world countries. I don't care if it gets stolen.<br /><br />Look elsewhere for a quality chain.
2.0,The product us as expected but there is a terrible chemical smell from the sunglass itself and all the included accessories.
2.0,Very cheap. Already broken off.
2.0,Cheap plastic buckle makes me unsure it would hold up to even daily use. It also makes little sense on how to use the buckle and change the belt length for 23 dollars I expected better. I would trade the crap survival kit for a better belt
2.0,"I do like the fabric which is 100% cotton.  What I don't like is the fit.  It shows it much longer on the model than it really is.  The fit other places is fine and the size is correct, but it isn't long enough.  It also bleeds when washing.  The label says to hand wash and that is correct, it does bleed.  I wish the fabric were softer, this cotton is pretty stiff and rough.  So disappointed."
2.0,A few bracelets where turned on already where I received them and some the batteries was already dead
2.0,Don’t buy. These pajamas arrived with no tags and the shirt has gross brown stains. Sending used items is NOT ok! So gross!
2.0,"The picture shown was Herringbone Wide Leg Grey/White, but the pants sent were straight black. Definitely not the item pictured, which is disappointing."
2.0,"What I don't like is the poor quality of the yarn. The sweater pills badly and soon looked like a ratty old sweater I've had for years. So, I only wear it around the house."
2.0,"Received these 4 days ago. I wanted to try them for a few days before leaving a review. I read the product reviews and noticed people mentioning the size issues. I wear a 10.5 normally, so I ordered the Large (11/12). When I first tried them on, the Large fit pretty well, but I would have preferred a little more wiggle room, but I feel the Extra Large will be too big. The fabric was really soft and comfortable, and I was okay with the sizing problem because I had ordered based off other reviews. I did notice that when wearing them, they retain a lot of heat inside the toe area and it can get pretty warm in there. But that wasn't really a big deal. However, today, I have noticed that the slippers are already starting to fall apart. The fabric on the inside is starting to peel back and it's only been 4 days with minimal use around the apartment. A little disappointed as I was hoping these would be better quality than some of the other slippers on Amazon."
2.0,Was not the quality that I expected it to be.
2.0,"I was on the hunt for a durable, supportive slipper and thought I had found just that when I ordered these scuffs.  Shortly after they arrived, I put them on and they felt supportive.  I had considered returning them because they felt almost too snug.  I wore them with a light pair of socks so I decided to continue to wear them with hope that they would relax (because they felt so good on my feet)!  They are very supportive and I would have worn them to the point of wearing them out.  Following a full day of indoor wear, I regretfully decided to return them after seeing the black scuff marks all over my hard wood floors. If Haflinger has an alternative ""supportive"" slipper, I will give them a try, but I will avoid any slipper with the black rubber sole."
2.0,Very disappointed. Did not read previous reviews. Came folded. Unable to re-shape. Garbage.
2.0,This was my second metal band purchase for my Apple Watch. This band was not comfortable as one strap was much shorter than the other. My previous band where the straps were closer in length was more comfortable. I returned this band to purchase another one with more even strap lengths.
2.0,Unfortunately my bracelet came missing some of the crystals.  It is a nice rose gold color with a nice weight to it but I had to return it.
2.0,14 days till delivery Really!!!  only one pair were blue blockers
2.0,B. S. This sock shows when you have on  loafers or moccasins.  False advertising
2.0,The size/fit is good and they have held up pretty well but they get so much sand inside them. Like a quarter cup of sand in each shoe at the end of the day. Makes them uncomfortable for my kid.
2.0,Cute earrings. One of them was bent to the point where it’s about to break. Only got one use out of them.
2.0,The ring was great but then I got a rash from it so be careful
2.0,Very thin not worth the money.
2.0,"I am usually a 6.5/7, so I thought it would be safe if I ordered 7.5.  WRONG!  Like others, my TOES were hanging out."
2.0,"The bra is comfortable, but the holes don't really hold the pump funnels by themselves.  So unless you have perfect suction, you still have to hold them. Plus, you can see the holes/fabric plainly thru your shirt. So it's not really work/public appropriate."
2.0,"All the grey parts of the socks are rubber, and my toes were wrinkled as if they had been in water for 8 hours. I cut off the toes.  I'm drier but bare toes aren't fun either.<br />There was no info on Amazon about the fiber or care. Get This: The package says okay to dryclean! I hand washed. it was fine.<br />One additional gripe. What the heck is ""coolover"" which is woven in the socks.  I wish companies outside the USA would hire someone who speaks English to write the ad and the package information."
2.0,"The chain fell apart the first day I used it. Then soon after the grip attached to the zipper broke, making it difficult to zip and unzip. But it’s not difficult to fix these issues if I want to. After all, it was a 12$ Amazon purse. I didn’t expect greatness I bought it because it was cute. If you’re looking for quality, I don’t recommend this"
2.0,very small didnt even fit a teenager .. but good for young kids .. very thin
2.0,They do not stay up. After wearing a couple of times they start to look bad
2.0,super tight around my calves and super thin.
2.0,"The concept is exactly what I need for my charms that I have. This is nice for a little while, then wrist started to turn green and the part that screws together (to get the charms on and off) snapped. Luckily I found all my charms. Bought a new one and it happened again after couple days."
2.0,"Very cheap material, and dress is see through. It is not really white with red flowers, but a grayish tone. I'm returning it."
2.0,i can tnot breathe in this. my children think i am joking btu. i am stuck
2.0,Too small thought it would be bigger😭
2.0,"Beautiful beads, came will packaged... However , the second week I had them I put them on and the string broke and shattered everywhere.."
2.0,I Love the shirt just too small compared to the size chart
2.0,I ordered this for my daughter. She wears a 12-14 and is 5'11. So according to the size chart I ordered a large. It would be questionable if the XL would fit. This was way too small and not in length. Waste of money because she can not wear it. Too tight and too small overall.
2.0,"Truly, if this is flannel, the thinnest I've ever seen or felt.  Reminds of you a well loved shirt that becomes brushed cotton over time from wear & washing.  Nothing warm about it, which is what most people get flannel for"
2.0,"The dress fit as expected as far as length goes- I'm 5'8, so it would work best on someone tall. The bust area was very fitted, so I would not recommend for anyone larger than a B cup. My problem was with the sleeves- they were HUGE and flared out at the sides, not fitted at all like in the picture. The material is also very shiny, so the grey part of dress was more like shimmery silver. Not what I was expecting, so I returned it."
2.0,"Very awkward. Looks like a shirt that was made slightly too long - but definitely not long enough to be a dress. I use a belt with it, because it didn't come with one, and when you don't use a belt it looks like a women's night gown. Not impressed."
2.0,"Didn't expect a lot but was hoping for interesting blink, not cheep looking greenish ball. $65?? Returned"
2.0,The suit was way too small. Order a size up.
2.0,"I had to safety pin the leggings to a pair of black tights under my skirt to make it work (I am going out as a bumble bee, so I have the tights and a matching headband with yellow and black striped antennae) because they kept coming down when I tried them on at home. Not as big as I would like; I guess I might have needed a plus size, but I am a size 12 so Idk."
2.0,"They’re weird, and tight in awkward spots and super long of your 5 ft like me: but they do the job and are minimally see through"
2.0,Halloween use...cut uneven..had to recut it
2.0,"I Wasn’t sure how to rate the sizing on this item because the legs are weirdly and incredibly short, but not like they’re supposed to be shorts or anything. The whole proportion of this garment is so inexplicably  off that we haven’t worn it yet. Every time I try it looks so ridiculous we take it back off. The color is beautiful however and I love the wooden buttons! But something is definitely wrong with the shape and size of this item."
2.0,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He is 6 and wanted the $150 version from Target with real articulating fingers, but I thought that was too advanced for him. This seemed like an inexpensive alternative that he could play with and I liked that the jewels on the hand actually light up.<br /><br />However, the battery it requires is impossible to find at most basic stores, like Target or Home Depot. And one of the gemstones fell off after the first use. So a bit disappointing."
2.0,"These run quite large, are made from cheap material, and have no lining whatsoever for the crotch. I normally wear a small, and these did sort of fit in size small, but they're so soft and stretchy that they could easily have fit someone twice my size. I gave two stars because they were not uncomfortable and the fit was okay, but I have never encountered such a cheaply made pair of underwear."
2.0,The designs were great but it is too small to screw it on so I had to return mine. I wish it came in a bigger size for the daith and tragus piercing.
2.0,I really made a mistake on buying this. It's very slippery and everytime it falls it comes apart.
2.0,"The color & material are not the same as in the picture, it was supposed to be white & it's a cream color & it looks like if it gets wet it will fall apart. I ordered a larger size & it's still not long enough to be a &#34;cover up&#34; as it covers nothing at all"
2.0,"My wife review: ""I bought a small (5/6) for my son, and a Large (9/10) for myself- I wear a 9 in shoes, my son a 4 and sources said 1.5 sizes up to get women's from kids sizes.<br />Arrived a mismatched pair small (5/6)/medium (7/8) hooked together by the plastic tags, and a large pair (9/10).<br />Before I took both out of the handsome cotton storage bag, I could tell right away something was wrong as the 2 pairs next to each other seemed almost identical in size.  I tried on all 4 slippers and they all were large enough for my entire foot to fit.  the 9/10 were huge, both in length and width.  the bottom of the 7/8 was actually LARGER than the 9/10 base.  Since the 5/6 fits my size 9 feet there's no way they will fit our son.  Perhaps shopping for slippers online during the holiday rush isn't such a good idea.  These will have to go back not sure they can be replaced and wrapped before Christmas, not sure what size would fit correctly at this point anyway.  The base seems to be a solid thick rubbery material which is what I was looking for, but it is actually a rubber 'cup' with a soft foam inside not supportive for a supposedly outdoor optional slipper.  The fabric was cozy warm."""
2.0,"I was over the moon to get this umbrella, it will save my sensitive skin from the sun! but alas, as i used it every day there are now holes in it where the joints of the umbrella are and i'm so disappointed! i really thought that i was getting a quality umbrella that would last for a long time and it's been less than 6 months and now i need another one. if you are using this as a once in a while umbrella then this is a good product but if you are going to use it daily as i do then it's not for you."
2.0,"After only 3 months, the strap has already broken off."
2.0,"I ordered a size up based on reviews. They are soft and fit comfortably, but they are awkwardly cut. After one wash, the threads are coming loose and the elastic band got all turned inside the waist. They’re still wearable, but more cheaply made than I expected."
2.0,Nice looking but runs small bought a large couldn't get over my head
2.0,The dress came in torn.
2.0,"Got the small for my son, which according to reviews and such, seemed correct. My son is 6'1"" weighing 150 lbs. The sleeves literally were in the middle of his forearm, yet the body fit pretty spot on. The only way to wear it is just as shown on the photo, which is scrunched up. Boo"
2.0,"Cheetah print fit as expected. Black part was much looser. Bottom of shorts hit mi-knee, which is too long."
2.0,Very pretty earrings but they were way too big!
2.0,VERY BAD QUALITY...AND SIZE TOO BIG...
2.0,The pendant itself is too big for a 6-year old.
2.0,It is not fitted and cute like seen in the picture.
2.0,"It’s a nice sweatshirt, however, the pocket is sewn over the print. I just cut the pocket off because it’s really not necessary but just a heads up for anyone that wants to keep the pocket."
2.0,Had to return. Product measurements were smaller than actual advertisement.  Quality was sufficient.  Only returned because they were too small and they didn't have a larger size available.
2.0,"Sizing is way off. My waist is 31&#34;, I ordered a 30-32 and couldn't buckle it at all. Way too small! There is no sizing info on the belt at all. Belt itself is okay, I guess."
2.0,"The flashlights arrived, & 4 out of 12 did not work. Disappointing!"
2.0,"Product fabric is bad quality, pads are extra long that hanging out from side"
2.0,"The bust is so small! I ordered two sizes, and still the bust doesn't fit. I'm a 36C, which is pretty average, so unless you're small in the bust, then don't go for it. I'm disappointed because I love the pattern."
2.0,"I normally wear an XS or S, but I ordered a medium and it was still SO short, which was definitely not advertised. Color is cute though."
2.0,"item was not of a quality that matches it's high price. not as pictured. a cute skirt, but not as cute as pictured. fabric is a thin canvas, closer to cheese cloth. would return if it was easier to make amazon returns."
2.0,"These panties are not 'full cut' as shown in the photograph.  I ordered the correct size; however, the measurement at the side from the top of the waistband to the bottom of top of the leg is much shorter than shown in the photograph and feels like the leg band is constantly riding up but in fact, it's too narrow to begin with.  In my mind, this is false advertising.  I do not recommend this product unless you are comfortable with the narrow measurement on the sides."
2.0,"Dont get me wrong they are cute and you do get 20 of them, but 7 of the 20 are blue 5 are purple 2 are ligt blue 2 are black 1 is pink 1 is green and 2 are dark purple. My problem is that it is not what you see in the pitures you get a lot of one colore as opossed to 2 of each. I didnt even get orang or red or maroon. And none are see through"
2.0,"I really dislike the straps.  I couldn't figure them out and think they are totally  unnecessary.  I finally gave up trying to get them straightened out and when I tried to take the bra off I got stuck in it.  I almost panicked, but talked myself down and calmly as I could, continue the difficult contorting requiring positions to finally free myself of it.  Needless to say I will not be wearing it every again.  It runs small too."
2.0,This item runs very small. Purchased two sizes up and was still to small.
2.0,"There was yellow marks on both boots, it looked  like it was from the boot being on top of each other for a length of time 😔The boot is a perfect fit, really comfortable."
2.0,Smaller than I was looking for  and couldn’t get back off. I could have tried harder but knew I wasn’t comfortable trying them on knowing could get stuck. I would have tried harder if size was what I was looking for.
2.0,"Cool, but broke the first time my wife put them on.  I was able to fix them, but still very fragile. Shipping takes forever."
2.0,Super cute but doesn't fit like a small at all. Completely falls off and the strings don't do anything to tighten the top. Would order again if they made a smaller size but its definitely not a traditional small.
2.0,It’s very generic. Looks like I could’ve gotten at Wal Mary for five bucks. Not worth the price at all (and wait time). I hate giving poor reviews but this is the truth. I wore it once and one of the buttons just came off.
2.0,Nothing like depicted
2.0,"I knew it was not going to be giant, but tiny I did not expect.  They must have included the bail and loop in the measurement!  The shell inlay was also very pale with no color.  I am sending this back, with sadness.  It is suitable for a young girl, not for an adult.  It is fairly crafted - hence 2 stars not one."
2.0,Looks great. Poor sizing. Can’t even get it on. Lining is thicker than the outer material.
2.0,Fabric is super stiff and not breathable. Folds in unflattering ways and doesn’t bend naturally with body movements. Guess you get what you pay for since it’s cheap and bad.
2.0,It's a cute bracelet but if u get it wet it will start to change color .
2.0,"These pajamas are really adorable, however that's where my joy in them stopped. First they run small, so size up, secondly they are mostly polyester so have very little movement, and are hot... really overall disappointing in the end"
2.0,Did not try on before return period.  Way too big!
2.0,"Cheaply made, falling apart after one month of use.  Runs small."
2.0,They Shrink (even in cold water  & no dryer) They wrinkle. I do not recommend if you are long waisted.
2.0,I really am so disappointed with this dress... I wanted to love it. There is a seam straight down the middle of the dress and the polka dot pattern does not line up and is mismatched. Same thing on the neck line. The same fabric is used and misaligned polka dots on top of polka dots is tacky. The dress fits very well but the patter and defects are too much. Back it goes.
2.0,The backs of these are very cheap and come right off with little to no effort
2.0,Umconfortable sandals to shower and one of them broke after 1 month....very bad quality.
2.0,"As cute as they are, they broke as soon as I took them out of the package. Came with no backpiece. After I fixed them, they broke AGAIN. I would not recommend getting this product."
2.0,I sent it back. It was just too small.
2.0,This bra is super cute and looks comfortable but the thing I was disappointed about is their isn't an option of sizes it's just one which is a medium. Not made if your big chested.
2.0,"Maybe it's a defective dress but it didn't hang right and it went back. Pulled to one side, wonky."
2.0,Heat up great!  but get holes easily.  They have lasted me 1 winter so far.
2.0,I could barely get these on they were so tight!
2.0,"I bought this chain to use with a medic alert and it was bigger than I thought and since the links are so big, it tangles and binds easily."
2.0,I love the prayer shawl. I don't like amazon pestering me about reviews.
2.0,I returned them cause they must run really small
2.0,I got a size up from my normal size and it was still quite formfitting. It also was very see-through. You'll need to wear a g-string or nothing to make it not obvious that it's see-through.
2.0,I returned and that process was very easy.  The shorts were not comfortable so I will get a different pair.
2.0,Nice dress just didn’t like the style on me .
2.0,Elastic is a bit small and I have small wrists
2.0,They works but my son has chunky legs and they were to tight and didn’t work very well:(
2.0,Loved the glass but just two weeks in and the hinge has come unglued from the eye piece... they are useless.  I'm not sure who I'm more disappointed in.... the manufacturer for poor quality control or Amazon as this is the 3rd pair of sunglass/readers i've ordered from different companies that are pure crap.
2.0,"I was very excited about this dress because the photos were beautiful. However, I noticed after purchasing, the stock photos with the girl were different than the pictures of the dress itself in the picture that followed. Fortunately , shipping was much faster than estimated.<br /><br />When I received the dress, it was a bubble gum pink (not the dusty pink at all) and smelled like fish. I tried it on and it didn’t fit right, chest area was too small and it just fit unflatteringly. The images of the dress on the sewing mannequin are closest to the end product I received. The midsection is sheer.<br /><br />I opted to return the dress and got a message that I felt was to deter me from returning the dress. It said the return process was “cumbersome” (without much explanation) but I can keep the dress for a partial refund. I pushed to return the dress for a full refund. Eventually, after back and forth communication) I got a return label for a US address and instructions. It wasn’t cumbersome at all? It just was different than the easy amazon return we may be used to.<br /><br />Overall I gave the two stars for the quickness of shipping and the customer service. Both of thoseI was pleased with."
2.0,Felt like a cheap fake leather
2.0,Size up 2 sizes from regular size
2.0,great idea but it comes apart when least expected.
2.0,"The waist band is very scratchy and elastic, not soft at all. I wear them, but they are my back up, period undies. Very unflattering unless you are a pencil with no body fat."
2.0,I wanted to love this dress.  The fit was great but the slip underneath was SUPER short.
2.0,These shorts are very cute-especially on the model! They make me look like I weigh 20lbs more than I do. If you're a skinny minnie these are for you! I had to send mine back though because they were defective. They were missing a belt holder thing on one side. I wish I was skinny!
2.0,Too bulky returned from credit.
2.0,"these are nice casual pants but waaay off sizing.  A medium not a medium, not even close."
2.0,"The balls are not true to size, very disappointed."
2.0,"This sweater is very thin, like the style and color but it is much smaller. I normally wear medium size tops and got this in large and it is way too small"
2.0,They just look like plastic gold.
2.0,sirve para charm Pandora
2.0,The hat was very small on my 10 month old. Hat is of nice quality but would fit a 3 month old...
2.0,When I got the flower it wasn't cream colored like in the picture it was yellow! I didn't like that at all!!
2.0,"I read the other reviews and saw that these fit oddly on your foot. I tried them anyways and they are decent quality, but your heal truly does ride on the inside of the sandal. Not recommended, to get some decent sandals on sale that fit right. Don’t try these......."
2.0,"i bought this for my fiance who breaks these shades often. she loves them and loves the polarized. She finally broke them and so I bought her another, but they were a completely different pair. Different design and not even polarized"
2.0,Worked very well however they squeek like crazy now!!
2.0,The shipping took forever! I had to email them just to figure out wat was taking the item so long. The lens of the glasses are almost like buying readers looking through them kind of hurts my eyes.
2.0,The color is different from the image. The real red wine is strange. The cloth is strange.
2.0,I dont care for the way they fit my face.  They don't have a bend to them and they are flat across my face.  I tried to bend them and got scared I would break them.  I took for ever for them to get here from CHINA and had I read more of the details I probably wouldn't have ordered these.
2.0,Definitely not water resistant to 10m. It's not water resistant to 1m. I washed my hands and it got water inside. It lasted 3 weeks before it started RUSTING inside. Now it's a paper weight. Just get a timex expedition for a beater watch. I wish I had.
2.0,We are returning them. Very small.
2.0,"These looked super cute, but the quality was terrible. One of the pockets was just a hole straight through because the seam had already come apart just from being shipped in the box. I returned them, sadly. If they were already falling apart there was no point keeping them, no matter how cute."
2.0,The pant fit beautifully but the quality is too cheap for the price I paid for. It’s thin and see through as well. Would have kept it if the quality is better.
2.0,A lot of the reviews said the dress ran small BUT that was not the case. It runs BIG. I had to return it. The inside was really itchy when i tried it on so I wouldn't have been able to wear it anyways.
2.0,"You really never know what to expect when ordering this brand!!<br />Some I've ordered come long, short, different color than ordered sizing is all wrong etc<br />I like this brand but it's hard to really know what your going to receive.<br />The customer service is ok they take them back but usually it's not worth the hassle ..buyer beware.<br />Until they figure this out I won't be buying these again."
2.0,Plastic lining did not match inside lining of bag.
2.0,"I've had this chain for a single day now, and the hook part has come off my belt loop 3 times now while walking in the store.  Not secure at all."
2.0,"First of all , I also have the same shades in white and theyre awesome. I like the style of these sunglasses.I would give those a 5*. I ordered the orange ones because in the pictures at least, the orange looks darker and more attractive to me anyway. Once I opened the package though, theyre either: EXTREMELY NEON-ish orange or they sent me the PINK option. Theyre nothing like in the picture and not what I was expecting."
2.0,wasted money on all the ankle bracelets i order  this summer for my daughter<br /> she was disappointed she sixteen and i gave them to her as a grift for the summer
2.0,Beautiful color fabric feel good but cheaply made. Not even a label.
2.0,It is a very useful item but I keep getting an allergic reaction when i wear it.
2.0,"These are huge. The size won't fit my baby, but I think they might fit my 6 year old!"
2.0,It's not sterling silver...more like stainless steal copper! if you look at the difference in my photos...it was gift for my daughter graduation but i can't give it to her.
2.0,"I bought 2 of these watches for my sons to use as soccer referees. The description says the watch has a timer, but it does not. It only has a stopwatch, which does not work for reffing. The watches also arrived late."
2.0,"This dress was the perfect length, but the elastic was very tight. I ordered according to the size chart, but the fabric didn't fully cover the sides of my chest. I returned and was very pleased with how easy it was. Will keep searching for a comfy, long dress."
2.0,"This shapewear top is a noel idea, but it is cut way too small. The small sizing should be indicated so  customers can adjust their accordingly."
2.0,"Super cute. However, my husband is already breaking. Had it for 10 days. Mine is holding up but not confident or will be for long. Too bad."
2.0,"I was hoping this would be a pretty sweater from the photos, but it was cheaply made and a strange fabric. I returned it."
2.0,"Make sure to measure.  I actually returned this item for one reason only, it makes noise when you walk.  Yes it takes care of the rubbing but because of the material it makes noise when you walk."
2.0,"That Ok,  what you paid what you get,"
2.0,"This shirt is ok. My boyfriend wanted to wear it when i gave it to him before washing it. BIG MISTAKE! It left his upper body all blue! haha Was pretty funny but weird that it did that. Needless to say, It didnt keep the color after the wash."
2.0,My son really liked this bag... until the side seam ripped after his first day using it. Would not recommend.
2.0,Not very easy to get on.
2.0,"Side zipper is awful, creates this rounded out zipper that sticks out of my side and is very noticeable..."
2.0,Look like graduation tassels hanging from your ear. I returned
2.0,Disappointed.  Looked like a shiny marajuqna leaf.  Returned.
2.0,I love the color  The size of the bag is great  But the strap is not long enough to be a cross body  Im going to keep it But that is the only thing about the bag I dislike  Thank you.
2.0,Broke really easy. Super sad they are cute
2.0,Initially good watch. Band broke within 2 months.
2.0,Like the material and style but leg area is way to wide and flares out :(
2.0,The black ones are a different size than the grey ones.  Much smaller and not proper quality.  Try another brand these aren't consistent I sizing and quality.
2.0,Dress was cute but picture was inaccurate to what the dress was actually made out of..actual dress was much lower quality
2.0,The logo is a cheap paste on.  Would not buy anither
2.0,Wrong glasses the first ones that order was much larger these are small and round cute but not the actual glasses that I ordered
2.0,"The item has not yet arrived for the address was incorect. The correct address was given by e-mail, yet some of the information was missing."
2.0,"I was super excited about this charm(the heart), because it was a special gift to a dear friend whose son committed suicide..I wanted to get his picture on a charm for a bracelet. It took a month to get here(it said it shipped Dec 5 but got here Dec 21). I was super excited but upset when I looked at it. Why in the heck is picture distorted? I’m very disappointed to say the least and I’d like to have a refund..I’m embarassed to even give it to her now.."
2.0,"Would be great if they would stay on!  They kept falling off of the heel and clumping underneath my foot -- I got so frustrated one day, I threw them in the garbage!"
2.0,"It's very cheaply made. Fabric is almost sheer. I prewashed on gentle before wearing and 1 of the seems was already coming stitched. The hems were messy with overlapping and big folds of material sewn in. Very comfortable to wear, probably just at home."
2.0,Totally not comfortable or expandable. Tight fabric and just cheaply made
2.0,"All I wanted was a nice pair of black denim leggings that fit.  I read the description carefully, ordered the correct size based on the seller's stated measurements, made sure I had selected black, and placed my order.  Surprise!  What I received was a dark wash blue, definitely shorter than stated... and what was supposed to be supportive yet comfortable seemed more like a torture device, designed to make me look and feel like I'd been stuffed into a sausage casing.  I double checked the label, thinking perhaps the wrong item and size had been sent in error, but no.  It was indeed what I'd ordered.  It arrived today - and the return label is already printed, waiting for me to take it to UPS tomorrow.  I'll just wait for Wallflower's curvy skinny black jean to be back in stock in my size - at least I know it will fit and be of good quality, for about the same price."
2.0,"This is at least 2 sizes smaller than my ring size. It was tagged correctly, but it didn't fit.<br />The color of the rose gold was very dull.<br />Returned.<br />2 * because of fast shipping."
2.0,These shoes run very small! I couldn't even get my child's foot into it! Returned.
2.0,"it is ok. the color looks red in the add ,but when it arrived it was peach, and the green looks more like mint. The outfit I brought it for it will not match it. I gave it away."
2.0,These don't do anything except turn everything yellow.  They don't cut down on glare and don't do as advertised.  I tried them at night when there was no weather; I tried them at night when it was raining and after it had rained.  No difference.
2.0,"Not teal, actual color i received was kelly green.  Not what i wanted."
2.0,"I ordered a medium, it fit more like a large. Shorter than expected. Im 5'4 and it falls about mid calf. Pockets are very small/ shallow."
2.0,The paint literally two seconds of wearing them caused the paint to scratch probably won’t last long
2.0,Thin material. Ordered large. waist was 3x.
2.0,Daughter needed these for dance class. She didn't like the material.
2.0,Pictures make them look a lot better they are very uncomfortable don’t seem like they are to durable I wear them on rainy days when my other boots are wet they actually suck
2.0,It’s cute if your going for the cheap look. It’s not cotton which it states but I didn’t bother reading . It’s very childish and cheap looking. Lame and basic people will love it . I’m over it
2.0,They look so goofy and my pair were bent when they arrived. I'd say they would work well as a cheap costume but not legitimate fashion. 4/5 for a costume and 1/5 legitimately.
2.0,Not actually a maternity shirt so it was really tight around my belly
2.0,Runs a little smaller then expected.
2.0,"I love the material and how soft the sweatshirt is, however, after washing it for the 1st time (alone) it more lint balls on it then I would expect.<br />MUST BE HAND WASHED!!!"
2.0,"Very See through, order at least 2 sizes up"
2.0,Strap clip ripped off. Have not even had this bag for a year and it already broke. I loved it until that happened. So disappointed
2.0,"Its ok , the front flaps are too long to me. I am 5'3&#34; and im 110 pounds and the small seemed slighty bulky on me. I can manage it with a belt over it but i dont love it."
2.0,"Love the shoes, but one foot doesn't charge. Waste of money."
2.0,"I ordered these earrings because I thought they were pretty and long. However, while nicely made, they are not long at all. And because they were packed in a small box, the dangles are kind of bent and out of place.  I don't like them at all. I have extremely long hair and wanted length. Thinking of returning them but not sure it's worth the trouble for $7.00. Not even thrilled."
2.0,Just got them yesterday and used for the first time today...no product dos or don'ts...I can't imagine what you don't do with them...Anyways the Right index finger claw came off...I put it back on and it came off again. These are a lot of money if I have to go find and pull out my glue gun trying to fix them. It looks like the claw is held on by a pin drop of glue. How are you suppose to work with them if they won't hold the claw on?!?<br />Very disappointed!
2.0,"El vestido, es lindo el estampado, también,,  lastima, la tela, de muy mala, calidad,, la talla, viene, perfecta,,"
2.0,"I am very disappointed in this product.  I know they are a knock off, but the workmanship is very poor.  The picture on the web page make you believe this is an expensive looking pair of sun glasses.  But when I received the product it was a totally different story.  They look very cheap and they do not fit very well on my face. The case is nice, but the sun glasses were disappointing.  You get what you pay for.  Oh, and one other thing, I did not receive my free microfiber bag."
2.0,Cheaply made. Nose pieces were off.
2.0,I ordered several of these..  2xl and 3xl for my son and nephew<br /><br />They look to be a large or maybe xl.
2.0,The material was somewhat see-through but the material was very stretchy and soft.  The seller was really nice. For the price I will make it work!
2.0,"Vests came in a ziplock bag as shown! I can't believe it wasn't stolen or damages. Color ordered was ""maroon"" but color of the vest is rust. Fit is a bit small. If you desire an ""oversized"" look order a larger than normal size. Length is about 22 inches which falls a couple inches below your natural waist line."
2.0,The ball chain kept popping open & the opening for the actual key is really small
2.0,First off the quality of this top is horrible because after I tried it on I noticed all these little holes in the lace and I'm not a very big person so if it can rip that easily just from normal wear it would probably get torn to shreds in a washing machine secondly I had to remove the under wire because it poked out in a weird way and served no real purpose so you'll still need to wear some type of bra with this plus it fit a thousand times better after I took it out and it did look good on me but I would not recommend this nor would I buy it again
2.0,They are pretty but not practical  as the brown tint doesn’t help with sun glare.
2.0,Stiching is poor and the fit is small.
2.0,Material is stiff and it's not comfortable.
2.0,Let me start out by saying it’s a super cute shirt…But BeWare I’m a size M so I ordered a M… I returned it! It was WAY to SMALL… probably need to go up 2-3 sizes..  I will say I didn’t care for the material either … not very soft.
2.0,"Watch band arrived today, I ordered the pink because in the picture it shows that it matches the color of the watch...it's actually more of a hot pink amd does not match well."
2.0,"I normally wear a small, but the small was too small and a bit see through. I’m bummed because i wanted to like these, but wouldn’t go with white again."
2.0,It's beautiful but a cheap piece of junk - don't waste your money.  The clasp is so hard to open and close that the bracelet broke the first time I tried to wear it.  It's also very rigid so just beware - I would have returned if I hadn't disposed of all the packaging. Better luck the next customer who spends their money on this - I wasted mine!
2.0,I'm petite and curvy so th jeans are very long on me. I'm taking them to be altered. They do have a little stretch to them. Also they're tight around the thighs.
2.0,They are nice but beware.... I Returned.I am a size large. ordered XL...still too small
2.0,This band would not fit my Ticwatch C2.<br />The description said it would fit a<br />Ticwatch C2.
2.0,"I'm so disappointed. I know these were very inexpensive but when I opened the package, where they bend the plastic wrapped package to fit in the small box, the larger size earrings posts are bent. They are unwearable. Plus, picture depicts metal backs and I received plastic backs."
2.0,Material very thin and not soft as claimed for a child’s tender skin. At least for my preference!
2.0,These run so small.  I normally wear a medium and couldn't fit into an extra large.  What on God's green earth is happening?  I'm going to start a pandemic vanity sizing company and everyone will love my clothes.
2.0,"I know this is a lower-priced piece of jewelry, but I was a bit disappointed in the quality for the price. There were no reviews when I bought, so I thought I’d weigh in. I bought it for my gradeschool-aged niece, and it ended up being awkwardly huge (the charm is about 1.5” high), with a very, very long chain that would certainly hang past the waist of a young girl. I had to shorten the chain. The charm is also “hollowed out” in the back—concave—making the charm feel rather flimsy and delicate for a kid who can be rougher on things. I’m worried it will bend/break easily, or that the stones will fall out. It’s still cute and a cool thing that you can get the school colors, but this was a bit disappointing as far as quality overall."
2.0,"I order two of these, one with the thick back strap and one without.<br />The one with the back strap was fine and kinda comfy but sat really low.<br />The one without was small and felt like really poor quality.<br />I’ll be returning both."
2.0,I dis not like how it fit
2.0,Sent back. If you are bigger thank a plank then forget it. It fatties you a lot and I am a small....
2.0,"The cobbler apron was much too short. I’m not even 5 feet and it was short. Have purchased cobbler aprons in the past and they fit better,  I do not recommend this products. Would not purchase it again."
2.0,Not very flattering as the picture shows.
2.0,"I give two stars since the shirt didn't have the correct information on the back.  An example is HMX is not the same as AN  and PETN is pentaerythritoltetranitrate.  I bought this for my dad for fathers day, who is an explosives expert, and found out from him there are a bunch of errors on the shirt."
2.0,Nice and stretchy...but NOT windproof as advertised
2.0,Terrible material.  Too large and not flattering at all
2.0,"This dress is made of a cheap and not very stretchy material, so when you put it on, it feels tight and inflexible. The colors are very cheap too. The flowers are black and contrasting to the blue, but in the picture you can't really tell. Waste of money! This feels like a 5 dollar dress...."
2.0,Very Very small and tight. But cute. And I am a small. Order a size up.
2.0,The item was placed on a keychain and the dice came out the second day. It was a gift for someone and they did not want to return it. Poorly made.
2.0,The fit is undesirable. The fit is boxie and stiff.
2.0,"Poorly designed & uncomfortable, wouldn't recommend"
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, I really did. I loved the colors and the pattern. With that being said, I am 5'8 which I think is pretty tall for a girl, and this dress seemed very long on me. Almost awkwardly long. The major deal breaker was the pleats at the waist wouldn't lay down flat at all and kept poofing out and making me look weird. I considered sewing the pleats down but ultimately decided to put the dress in the donate bin because my boyfriend said I looked too much like a librarian and that the dress was a weird length."
2.0,cuando te los colocas en los ojos alrededor se visualisa tu silueta no los pude usar para andar en mi bicicleta pues tengo que ir viendo a los costados y no se logra ver
2.0,"Posts are too filmsy, sfraid they will break"
2.0,"Broke in no time, he loved it but it broke."
2.0,Already tearing after only a month of use.  Disappointed for the amount of money
2.0,These shoes hurt my feet. I tried working through it for a week but they're no better. My cheap shoes work better.
2.0,No actual filters in or with it not happy
2.0,Not an extra large fit. Glove is tight on the hand but long in the finger. Not a comfortable thing.
2.0,The heart is crooked when screwed in all the way.
2.0,"I have a big wrist, But not way too big. This thing was way too small."
2.0,No elastic in either pair that I bought.  Like putting on a rag....
2.0,This is for a child or someone with a very small head
2.0,Elastic band isn’t sewn well it rolls over which isn’t flattering but it’s a cute outfit
2.0,Very cheap looking but I guess I should have not expected much for a $16 wallet. The hardware seems very chintzy and seems like it will break easily. The inside is very crinkly sounding but more so with this specific RFID wallet. It's going back for a refund.
2.0,The material feels so plastic on the skin. I won't order again.
2.0,"If this is a dress (I ordered 7/tall), it is very short and wide.  I have already returned this as it was not as it appeared in the picture."
2.0,Not able to use much since No pockets to keep keys or phone
2.0,Warning!  I got my pants tonight - the ones with colored trees.  The description is WRONG!  There is no elastic in the waist of the pants I received.
2.0,I bought this dress and I love it but the problem is that the sleeves are not  long like the one in the picture  I may need to return it I wanted to wear it on my birthday ....
2.0,"Size is ok but you get what you pay for. This is not denim in the true sense of the word (I don't know that to call it). It is certainly not the denim one gets in jeans and other denim shirts.  The stitching is awful with crooked seams and many hanging threads. The width of parallel stitches varies and most stitches that are supposed to be straight are not. This is definitely not a shirt I would wear anyplace other than around the house or while working in my yard. And,I would certainly not purchase another!"
2.0,Not a great watchband. The nylon is very stiff and the metal loops are quite large. My main problem with it is the seam where it folds on the buckle. The trimmed inside edge is stiff and sharp and cuts into my wrist. I tried trimming it so it wouldn’t be so uncomfortable and it didn’t work. Finally covered the sharp edge with a small piece of black tape and it’s better.<br /><br />I really don’t believe I should have to modify a purchased item to make it useable. I would not purchase this again.
2.0,Way too small and I ordered up
2.0,"These looked much nicer on amazon. In reality, they are cheap in appearance, and look like they are another Chinese product. Dont buy unless you like cheap looking glasses! After 1 month, the screws have loosened too."
2.0,"After a couple of months, I noticed &#34;pock&#34; marks all over - sides and bottom.  I do not recall how this could have happened.  I know it's not real leather but I've had other purses faux leather that never did this.  So, now, I've purchased a genuine leather tote bag and hope that it is longer lasting.  It got 2 stars because I liked the size and pockets inside."
2.0,"Fabric was very heavy, almost denim weight. There were no fasteners, other than the belt and it is a wrap around. Had I kept it, it would have needed some snaps or velcro at the waist."
2.0,Not the same as the Tech long boxers. They seem to run tighter and dont fit as well as the Tech boxers.
2.0,Ordered a size 10.5 and got a size 10
2.0,The color didn’t look anything like the picture. You could tell the dress I got was a cheaply made knock off. So disappointing.
2.0,"Its not slim fit , and the bottom garter is so big or loose,"
2.0,Blue Pair looks like it was chewed on. Poor quality control.
2.0,should have ordered larger size
2.0,Very large. The shoe part fit great but the rest of the boot was huge
2.0,"Even though they are super Cute, the memory foam would be more supportive for the price point. Also, it looks like these have been returned before as there were feet impressions already on them and the soles are bit worn. The back of the slippers are just right for my foot, but the toes are super long and I have long toes!"
2.0,Cheap they were and cheap they are
2.0,Looks cheaper than the price I paid
2.0,"Well this bag size style and pattern are all really cute. The quality materials used are less than satisfactory. The canvas is more like a cheap polyester fabric with foam backing to make it stiff the lining is an even cheaper polyester fabric.  zippers are sewn weird and cheap. I want to like this bag but it's just overall disappointing. However if you're buying this for a preteen 13 14 year olds random crap it would work,  just not for a mother of two who wants to have a decent tote bag.  unfortunately I will not be able to return it either because I don't have an Amazon or UPS store close by to drop it off to and in order to for them to send someone to pick it up it would cost me more money than I want to spend to return a $13 bag"
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter and they broke as soon as they fell of the table, they are cute though."
2.0,"I was underwhelmed with these. The post is so tiny, as though it’s made for a child. Once in they’re ok looking, but if I had seen these in person I would not have purchased. I always have to manipulate the post open to put in my ear then gently pinch it a little tighter to secure them or else I’m afraid the short post may come out during the day. A few more times of that and I think the metal might snap in half. Two stars bc the stones look fine, just the overall size made me wonder if I missed that this is for children in the description (but what child would be wearing this type of stone anyway?)."
2.0,Low quality adult mask. I only used them for non crowded place for short duration. Doesn’t feel safe with them.
2.0,It’s cute but weird how it’s shaped. A little confused on how they beamed it up. I would skip this dress and go with something else next time.
2.0,These have a lot of compression and run smaller so size up<br />I also like my leggings a bit higher waisted and these run below the belly button on me.
2.0,Mine broke after only two days!
2.0,Got partial refund for issue with neck elastic as it seems to be nonexistent.  I will spend the partial refund on a tailor to fix that problem.
2.0,"I didn't expect the length to be so short. Overall not that happy with it, but I'm sure it was just my misunderstanding."
2.0,"I'm not sure what the issue with this is. It didn't feel small in the body at all, but the straps hurt so bad and under my arm, and it was NOT even tightened all the way."
2.0,The inside of the bag has a horrible smell similar to fish. I'm still airing iy out and it may need to be returned.
2.0,Waste of money!!!😡😡
2.0,They fit nice but they are short. Not for tall girls.  See through also.  Not for actually working out.
2.0,"I bought this set on Nov 10th, just barely over 2 months ago.  On the womens set, a stone fell out (see picture) about a week ago, and the rings have gotten horrible looking, with scratches and terrible discoloration (see picture).  There is NO WAY these are as actually sterling silver as seller claims.  I am not hard on rings, and they havent been subject to any chemicals or anything other than normal wear.  They were beautiful when I got them, but should certainly stay nice for longer than a month or two!"
2.0,"Looked bigger on screen, way too small for my wedding party gift."
2.0,Didn't take long to break  very flimsy  and the screen protector was plastic hard to get the bubbles out.  Not really worth it. Brought another type of case
2.0,"Too large, awkward fit, my daughter is small for her age but this outfit swamped her little body. Material is ok but kind of thin should maybe be double layered?"
2.0,"This dress was two months late getting here.  It arrived about 4 months after it was order, it's cute for the price, but nothing like what is pictured and runs small.  Lucky it was for a play that was postponed a whole year because of Covid-19.  So I'm not too upset."
2.0,Ordered for my holloween out and was mislead by the size from the picture. They were way too small.
2.0,"Looked nice on my son, unfortunately it broke within an hour or 2 of wearing it."
2.0,"Not sure how these have such positive reviews. Material is good, and they seem well made. But that’s where the good ends for me. I don’t know if I should say they are too big or too small. The waist is tight. Stretchy, but definitely snug. Sizing up is out of the question because the rest of the shorts is way too big. They are extremely high waisted, even with the waistband folded over. They fit in the crotch how I would expect men’s shorts to fit...with that extra room that they need!!<br /><br />Sadly I waited over a week for these to come(with 2 orders canceled or lost in between). The last order was good, had them in the standard 2 day Prime dekivery. I was really looking forward to them. It’s so hard to find women’s athletic shorts in a nice long length. Unfortunately these just not the right fit for me. For  reference I am petite with an athletic build, 5’1” and about 115 pounds. These might work better for taller ladies, but for me, nope. Going back."
2.0,Came without a tag. Another shirt I bought from this company had make up stains on it. Another came without the bow. Would not recommend.
2.0,It’s just meh I wouldn’t buy another dress like this bc I can find better elsewhere. Material was thinner and I ended up not doing my Halloween costume (silvermist fairy) bc I didn’t like the dress on me
2.0,"Weird polyester material. Not a nice, soft blend as so many are today. Pumpkin pic was also weird on the front...like cheap, faded screen printing. It wasn't pretty as seen in pic."
2.0,"Ehhh the color of the helix I got was rather dull, almost grey-ish. Not like the pic."
2.0,Runs large and needs to be washed alone or it will ruin anything it is with
2.0,"She had it on for about 2 minutes before she looked down and tugged on the bows, which then came off because they’re just glued onto it, not sewn."
2.0,"I ordered size medium which is what I wear is similar brands of the same item. I am not a large person and medium is borderline too large. These are cut so short they barely pull up over my hip bones and are very short, not the leg length as indicated in the picture.  Although I ordered medium, the items indicate size is “universal.”  Big disappointment and waste of money."
2.0,"The small size is still big. Also, it tends to  fold at the bottom when you put it down. Material is good but overall, I don't like it."
2.0,"I loved how it looked on my car but it arrived torn on the ears, poorly designed."
2.0,"Said in description that it was a blend of cotton and polyester, but when I recieved it ,it was 100% cotton"
2.0,"Cute shoes, but they hurt my feet & the shoes have no arches."
2.0,"The fit of the sweater is nice, but the picture makes it look avocado., Which is why I was getting the sweater.What actually shows up is kind of more of a muddy green and yellow"
2.0,"Too small, too small, too small. I would have had to size up 3 or 4 times for this to be wearable."
2.0,"While the hat is comfy, it is not big enough to allow for the slouch at the top/back. Just another beanie hat. No slouch."
2.0,"I’m 5’8, 150lbs. They fit.. somewhat. They definitely were not full length like I thought they are about 2-3” above my ankles which is still a cute length but not what I had wanted. The scrunched part on the booty is weird and not in the right place at all it was only on my lower back and ended before my butt even started. The pockets were not fully sewn, Each pocket has a 2” gap. so things like keys and chapstick will fall out. The waist band is super cute but really itchy and annoying feeling. I will be returning and will not buy these again."
2.0,It was really small and tight
2.0,"I chose this based on reviews and the fact that it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for at a good price. Unfortunately it is way too small-- the medium is more like an extra small. And the weird thing is, the cut is crooked.. So even if it was big enough, the area that gets snapped together would be completely off center (and very uncomfortable!). I was able to make use of this by not snapping the bottom closed and wearing it tucked in."
2.0,Cute sweater but threads pulled immediately.
2.0,"I ordered both the medium and the small to see which fit best. I'm 5'3 and 130 pounds and the small fit perfectly. I found the color (more orange than tan) wasn't flattering on my skin, so I returned it."
2.0,"I really liked these. Fit well, sizing is accurate, comfy and soft. The problem is they are see through. I bought green, blue and black. You could clearly see the pattern on my underwear in all of them and in some even the color (which was nude). I returned. Very disappointing!"
2.0,"Nice colors and design, but definitely for people with small breasts"
2.0,I thought these ran really small. I'm normally a large but I got XL because I usually like work out tops a little roomy and I thought with the tie I could adjust if it was too big. The shirts barely fit around my arms or across my chest! The quality seemed fine though.
2.0,This says men’s bracelet cuff... IMO it’s more like a boys bracelet cuff. It did not work for what I was going to use it for. You would have have a very small wrist if you want to wear it. It would fit a smaller females wrist but not a normal to large male wrist.
2.0,Did nothing for my booth! LoL<br />Comfortable  to wear with no undies but a little sheer so wear undies same color.
2.0,Had to glue the ear a little better cause it was starting to come apart when we got it in the mail
2.0,The wallet is made of leather-like  material but is not genuine leather.
2.0,"Really low quality, expect the fasionable colors but the quality isn't there but cheap so can't expect much<br />Hole separated first use"
2.0,Very thin. Hard to get on and off.
2.0,Runs small and is not exactly like the photo. It’s a like a lesser quality knock off. Definitely not worth the price but it arrived the day of my event and I didn’t have time to find anything else. Had to make it work.
2.0,The boots are ok if you are going to save them for nice. My son has had these for two months. He wears them to school and has a hole in the toe already. The lower leather is not very tough.
2.0,The shirt itself was cute but I am returning because it was way to large! Had a few strings hanging off of it but nothing that you couldn't trim! I was thinking that it would run a little small like most shirts do that I order so I went with a large.. I am thinking a small would have been better! Make sure you know what size you need! On a side note... the return it easy to do! Love that I can try thing on and not be stuck with them if they don't fit!
2.0,easily bendable
2.0,Pin that holds the band to the bracket broke within a week
2.0,"Bought this for my daughter who is 5'8"" and bigger chested. The fit was so odd and unflattering.  The crotch area rode up too high and the top was too small for her chest. Returned without issues"
2.0,"I love the ratchet feature, but the black enamel on the buckle has almost completely with away in only 6 months."
2.0,"I like the style but the color was completely misleading. I got the black and white, instead, it was brown and white. The white spots are actually beige/brown. I returned it."
2.0,"Super cute, but broke right away. I tired to fix it but it kept breaking again. Good size and stayed in."
2.0,"runs short. looking for a tall size and thought this might work, but it runs even shorter than normal. the fabric is also thin."
2.0,"The cuff itself was adorable, but don't expect it to fit on your ears like it does in the picture. I can't even wear mine at all it's so small..."
2.0,Stiff fabric and it wrinkles a lot
2.0,It doesn’t not lock properly always open
2.0,Winter has hit and my husband really needed these thermals. Don't have time to reorder. Would like a refund or a discount.
2.0,Ordered for my little girl for my wedding (flower girl) looks very cheap :( the tutu separates and bunches up and  you can easily see the slip underneath
2.0,Very flimsy already broke.
2.0,returned...not flattering
2.0,The wristband looks great but ripped less than 3 months into using it. Not the most durable strap.
2.0,"The sizing it way off.. I ordered a medium based on what an influencer said, and got it and it was TINY.. almost like an extra small.. returning.. SIZE up if you plan on getting"
2.0,The beads are VERY small and cross is VERY thin
2.0,Runs a little small.  Did not come with sash/belt pictured.  Print on the outer skirt is screen printed.  This dress will need a small petticoat to make the skirt fall right.
2.0,There are sooo many good reviews for this dress I just had to get it .. I got the white colored dress .. it just arrived today and when I opened the bag and touched the dress it was like moist/wet ... it is alsooo very see through... idk how to feel about it
2.0,"I was searching for a nice quality and affordable sleep sack and found this on Amazon. I thought it will be a great product. However, once I received the package, i am so disappointed. The size chart is totally misleading. Size M is suppose to fit 3-5 years old. However, it is so small!! Compare to my last one bought from HALO (12-24 months) it is even shorter than that for about 5 inches!! I am returning it. I think even if I ordered a L size, it's going to be the same length as the HALO brand. (HALO is so much nicer in the fabric BY THE WAY, but it's more expensive too) Another thing, this one is not red at all but it's more of a hot pink color. I think the photo is misleading on the color."
2.0,feel apart before I could wear it and the clasp wouldn't open at all.  Husband was able to fix it so I was glad I didn't spend much on it.
2.0,"I'm 5 foot 4 and 135, but the size small was still way too big. It went past my knees, was loose in the waist, and the open back bulged way from my back. The quality was okay, the top part felt nice, but the material of the skirt felt a bit cheep."
2.0,"The fabric is much thicker than expected... possibly something you'd wear under snow pants or somewhere that is very very cold. My wife is normally a size 0 or 2, so I assumed a size small would be good for her, but these definitely run really small. They can stretch a little, but I'd still order a size up if you do plan to get these leggings. Also, I wouldn't recommend them as maternity wear as there isn't really room for a growing belly."
2.0,"Are not as warm as expected, seem very similar to dollar store gloves with extra stitches in index finger sections..sorry!"
2.0,One of the pair is put together backwards so the back of the earring faces front.
2.0,Wasn't my jam. The sleeves weren't long enough and cut wasn't quite right to look flattering on me. Had to return even though it was a good price because I would have never worn it.
2.0,"As reviewers said the sizing is crazy. I am 5'4 and 125lbs, I ordered the XXL and it was very fitted across chest/waist/arms. The length was good for leggings, etc. The fabric/color/button holes are very stiff, but I'd expect it will soften with washes. Also material has a very strong chemical smell. Returned due to bad fit. Be cautious when choosing size!"
2.0,"No adhesive, had to buy super glue. Description should be more clear."
2.0,"I wanted to love this bra so bad!! Its really beautiful and actually fit really well. However, the seam between the lace and the satin is really thick and bumpy. It was viable under my shirt even though the bra fit really well."
2.0,The only complaint I have about this dress is that it came with no tags on it.  I am not quite sure how they do things in China but when you get brand new items they all should at least come with a tag on them.  In this case dress kind of seemed used.  It did take quite a while to arrive and that was another downfall.  Other than that the dress is very colorful.  I am 5'6 and weigh 280 so a 3x is still tight.  Just a FYI.  Don't think I will be ordering again.
2.0,"Beautiful for about 5 wears, then the stone fell out. I’d buy it again if I knew the stone wouldn’t fall out."
2.0,Skirt is very pretty but it’s completely see through and I can’t wear it.
2.0,"I gave them 2 stars for nice appearance/style, but took off three (considered four), because after one wash, they look like I've been wearing them for a year.  My washer/dryer are new new and I have found that are reasonably gentle on clothes (and these socks were washed with a delicate cycle), so I don't think that's the issue.  I noticed yesterday, as I was looking at them without shows on, they are semi-transparent, meaning, you can see through the material.  I'm not sure if that is on purpose (breathability) or just cheap.  I won't recommend or buy them again.  Too bad, they pretty good if you like the logos."
2.0,"The fabric wasn't what I had anticipated.  I thought it was going to be more like t-shirt material,  a cotton knit. The skirt is more like a satin with no flexibility of movement"
2.0,Very small!!! I wear a 10/12 and have a DD bust. I ordered the XL and it is way too tight across the chest. Their Size guide is not accurate.
2.0,Looks nice and it is well built and very hefty but that is why I gave it two stars.  It was so heavy that it was uncomfortable in my pocket so I took my keys off of it and now it resides in my junk drawer.  Not practical to carry in the pockets.
2.0,Way to small for the size indicated.
2.0,"I love dotted Swiss, and it's typically cotton. This blouse is 100% polyester, which just isn't the same. I expected it would at least be easy to care for, but it wasn't.  I washed and dried it on delicate according to the instructions, and it didn't do well - it came out more wrinkled than when it went in the wash. It also had a strange odor after I washed it (I use fragrance-free detergent, so it wasn't that). The loops that go around the buttons are SO TINY - it's very difficult to manipulate them yourself. The white color is very sheer. The construction also seems very basic - we'll see how it does after a few wears. It fit about as expected."
2.0,I had this dress before and loved it. I gained a size so I ordered another a size up BUT it's not the same quality. The second dress I ordered had the metal glued on the dress and the fabric wasn't sewn or edged. It'll come loose from washing eventually. I'm returning.
2.0,"Does not look like the picture! The quality is thicker and better than I expected but it’s very bulky and just unflattering. I am 5’2”, roughly 125/thin and I got a small which was not a good fit. It seemed larger and longer than it should be. Perhaps it would have been perfect for someone who was taller."
2.0,cool item it works good just got misled thought it was a counter top display with 24 pcs. instead just got a single pc.
2.0,"Shoulders way too large, neck too tight, too bulky with no shape!"
2.0,Super thin and there was a hole in the seam after very few uses.
2.0,"The dice are not really even cubes, the corners go out to points, these are just kinda awkward and low quality."
2.0,"Nice, it was for a gift.  Well received.  Arrived in a timely manner."
2.0,to tight on the bottom
2.0,"just a lot smaller then I thought, not good for my son"
2.0,Super cheep I every way but fun for kids. I won't wear them. They look and feel cheep and are very floppy feeling.
2.0,"The fit and style are good however the fabric feels cheap and coarse on the skin, not soft as one has grown accustomed to with swimsuits."
2.0,"Poor quality, tarnished after a few wears."
2.0,Great product but received the wrong one
2.0,"The charm are pretty cute,but the rope part is really not cool. They look cheap, not properly tied in an adjustable knot like you would expected. The white one is just impossible to wear. I kept the beads and us the string to tie plastic bag around the house."
2.0,"I ordered an XL thinking it would be like the picture… a little loose and baggy, usually what I get when ordering that size.<br /><br />It’s not like that at all… it’s a much tighter fit. It certainly does stretch but that’s not what I was expecting"
2.0,"This is easily two sizes too small.  And it is short, so if you have a long torso or if you like your sweaters to hit at your hip or lower- you may want to pass on this. Unfortunately I didn’t try it on until the return window had passed so I’m stuck with it"
2.0,Size chart is way off on this suit. It says an X-L is 16-18 which is crap. I wear a 10-12 and I was being on the &#34;safe&#34; side. The suit is short and I can't get it to cover my top section. I'm def returning it.
2.0,"I liked the band, just after using it for a week it broke."
2.0,"I have been loving this strap for 3 years, but the “leather” ends are all cracked and about to let go…. Other than the ends, it’s held up well, but I really think the imitation leather is just poor quality and should last longer than a few years."
2.0,"I bought this same underwear a couple of years ago and they held up very well, unlike these.  I just bought this pack a couple of months ago and they already have holes in them.  Very disappointed."
2.0,The protector does not always stay on the heel.
2.0,Bought for 11 year old and broke after one week of use.
2.0,Yes they are really sheer and soft and also stretchy . But I think they are to thin. And I would say not made of great fabric. But for the price it is a good value. There just not for me.  And the size runs true.
2.0,It looked different than the picture.
2.0,"Theyre really cute, but they really won't clip on your ear right!😒 However, I had other uses for them, and they came really quick; so, I give them two stars!"
2.0,"I'm 200 lbs, 5ft 7in, 40DD. I have ordered several jumpsuits from Amazon.  I always get an XL.  This XL was more like a medium.  It's a pretty jumpsuit but the torso wasn't long enough, emm it was like perma wedgie when I put it on.  I will be returning this week."
2.0,"Two stars only because the quality and color are fine. However; this is NOT a quick release strap as advertised, and did not even come with pins to attach to the watch!"
2.0,I give it two stars because it was very cheap and itchy material. wore it once and it fell apart.
2.0,"SEE UPDATEAT BOTTOM<br />Original Review:<br />I have been using this belt for many months now. I really like it.<br /><br />It does take a little while to get used to the mechanism when coming from a traditional belt. I can't knock it for the learning curve, however, because once you have the muscle-memory, you can adjust or remove this belt faster than anything.<br /><br />I only knocked a star off because they squeak when pivoting on the hinge while not being worn. I work a different shift than my wife, and when I get home, then go to bed, I take my pants off (belt and all) and while holding my pants looking for a good place to drop them, that buckle dangles and squeaks like crazy. It used to wake my wife, but I think she has learned to ignore it now. Still annoying though.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Didn't last as long as expected.<br /><br />I had 2 belts, and neither lasted a year. Both belts broke at the same place, the cast metal mechanism that grabs the belt. Both of them broke in half near the tooth that grabs the belt. This is a good design, but really poor material choice. The cast metal (Iron?) was way too brittle to be used this way."
2.0,these are very cheap and look different in the pictures. im very unhappy with it.i have a couple others on their way i hope theyre not as cheap as this one
2.0,"This skirt is absolutely ENORMOUS. Also, the underneath part is white, which in person is not attractive."
2.0,I suppose it would be an amazing dress if you were over 5’9 and had a fantastic figure. Sadly that’s not me so I looked more like a stuffed sausage.
2.0,"The bottoms looked great, not so much the top. The placement of the straps made the top appear very ill fitting. The print was great though. I wish it had fit a little better."
2.0,"There is not enough padding in the top of the swimsuit, you could literally see straight through! I am a C-cup and the way this top fit it made me look as if I had no chest at all. The material of the product is good which was sad because I really wanted to like this product, just not sure who/what kind of body type it would be flattering for."
2.0,"VERY LARGE, have no shape. fabric is kinda a rough processed cotton. not a fan"
2.0,"Its hard to see the time, the glass give too much glare. The time its self is not accurate, it move faster. I need to adjust the time every 3 days. Its thin and cheap watch, looks good but dont expect too much."
2.0,My daughter was very excited for her own watch. It wasn't long before the band broke. She was very disappointed and upset.  Hand to buy another one.
2.0,"These are good shirt stays, they get the job done, but after a few wears I noticed that they are not the same length! I am 6'4&#34; so I have these maxed out in length and one is about an inch longer than the other one, making it noticeable tighter on that side.<br /><br />This shouldn't be a big deal for shorter guys who can adjust the clamps accordingly, but beware if you are tall!"
2.0,One band arrived without the clasp on it and another band broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,Not a “deep v”.
2.0,Didn't realize how tiny they were & birth of the lense were written on
2.0,"Large and fake, you can totally see the difference"
2.0,"Had to return, the quality wasn't good, you can see the thread at the seam."
2.0,"It must be for one of the elfs, it is way too small!"
2.0,"These earrings look great, but the hook fell off one of mine after s several wearings."
2.0,I ordered the US-XL and it fits like a medium. t was the one thing I got for myself for Christmas and can't wear it and gave it to my son. I will never order from this company again.
2.0,I didn’t care for this. It was too bulky. I don’t wear regular glasses (just for reading very small print) but I use my sunglasses all the time so it wasn’t too practical to pull out both pairs of glasses every time.  It always seemed to be in the way in my purse. If one wears regular glasses and sunglasses a lot I suppose it would be nice.
2.0,I bought 2 of these. First one I lost same day. Second one I made sure the screw was tightened and I lost it two days later. They unscrew so easily. They were pretty and I was really hoping it would have worked out.
2.0,"The purse if 'pretty' but VERY STIFF.  Going to give it some time to see if it loosens up a bit, if not, I may return.  Also the warnings to keep away from water are a tad confusing?  Huh, will I be electrocuted?"
2.0,Material wasn't as absorbent as I desired.
2.0,Fabric is too stiff and light to hang nicely.
2.0,This product runs small and should not be described for level 4 high impact.
2.0,Nice robe. Soft and cozy but just too small. Not sized for a tall man.  Even though it was too small my husband was reluctant to return because he liked it so much. Great for a smaller man.
2.0,"Pretty dress. Fits nicely. There was a piece of thread hanging from the dress, and there is a malfunction in the pattern and discoloration on the back of the dress. But for those things, it would've been perfect."
2.0,"I'm not a big fan of the look of these. They remind me of men's underwear. And they're thin and translucent. The fit is good, and they're comfortable. But I prefer another style from this brand without the large white waistband. I'm not sure if it's these underwear or not, but  I've worn the three pairs in three days twice, and both times my stomach started itching like crazy. I think I might be sensitive to the elastic."
2.0,Was not put together very well. Coming apart on top. Sent it back. It's too bad. I loved the way it looked.
2.0,Wayyyyyyy too big.
2.0,"The dress doesn't look anything like the pictures, color is very deceiving, the bottom skirt looked very cheap and ugly that my daughter didn't even want to wear it. It was a total disaster to find another similar dress for her at the last minute."
2.0,The fit was ok but these fogged up as soon as I put them on. As it get moist inside it stuck to my face.
2.0,The bag wasn't all what I expected it seemed very cheap and quickly made. I've bought it and honestly never used it because i was terrified that it would break under my rough lifestyle.
2.0,Little bit different from orginal
2.0,The light blue is sheer. Even with a nude bra on underneath the outline can be seen.
2.0,"Very pretty, but very cheaply made! Doesn't even feel like metal and the blue isn't anywhere near as pretty in person."
2.0,The bow on the shorts was sewn crookedly and in a random spot....there was a shoe string type of ribbon I assume for the headband which doesn't match the set at all.
2.0,I love the look and fit of these cute shoes but after one week the soles are worn almost completely through. If I were to press a bit on the most worn areas I there would be a hole in the bottom of the shoe. Don’t expect these to last long.
2.0,The white gown started to tear at the seems before I even put it on and then just disintegrated.
2.0,"I bought this for my husband and it’s child sized.  The description claims “Men’s” sized, its not.  It looks to be well made and good looking."
2.0,"This arrived as a crop top, not a tee shirt. It is super wide and very short. It is not a normal tee."
2.0,Quality is not what you pay for! I got that dress in deal for $10. The fabric is very thin and the stitching is very poor. Loose threads and loose hemming. Its good for few wears before its wash.
2.0,I ordered my size and it’s huge.
2.0,"Beautiful skirt, very long in length, but waist runs small."
2.0,"The bracelet was attractive, but bends easily, and the catch won't stay closed.  Also, this item was listed as a charm bracelet. I bought for a gift along with charms made by the same company.  The charms did not fit. There were decorations on the bracelet which stopped the charms from moving completely around the circumference.  As there was no time to replace,  I ended up filing the decorations down.  It worked."
2.0,I should have read the reviews closer...panty liners will not stick. Although comfortable they are now useless to me. Expensive lesson learned!
2.0,"It came poorly lubricated. It was very cheap so, what am I to expect? I wish it was lubricated properly though."
2.0,"I'm sorry, these earrings along with the pink ones from the same company look fake, like costume jewelry your little girl plays with."
2.0,This is awesome for holding keys/cards/cash when you don't want the hindrance.  PERFECT for the gym...although that I not what I'd hoped for....I will still find purpose for use.
2.0,The Large is really a Large - A little too large -<br />I re-ordered this one - colors faded from use last year - for some reason this lot was a little large - I returned it
2.0,"I have had a similar bathing suit cover up to this one that I loved, so I thought this one would be similar.  The one I had before was an X-large, made of 100% cotton, and fit beautifully over my size 14 body.  I ordered an XX large and it was too snug, plus made of some kind of polyester material.  Unfortunately we were gone a lot this summer and I realize now I may not be able to return it."
2.0,"I purchased these because I really wanted to fake an added inch to my height by using a shoe insert.  I cannot use these lifts because they lift my heels right out of my shoe.  I live in Arizona and seldom wear closed toe shoes, but I wasn't intending to turn my sneakers into slip ons, which is what happens when I try to use these.  Not to waste anything and always looking for alternatives/options, the sloped shape make for a very nice door stopper.  And the gel grips nicely onto the ceramic tile to keep my door from slamming shut from the cross breeze.<br /><br />I did receive a discount in exchange for an honest review, but my rating is for my experience with the product.

2.0,"This set of stud earrings are pretty and I love the rose gold color. The first day that I decided to wear them, I chose the rose gold earrings and as I placed the earring on and was pushing the backing on, felt like it bent. I did not take it off to check though and went about my day to work.<br /><br />At the end of the day, as I was taking them off, the same earring snapped off into two pieces as I removed it. This was so disappointing. I have worn the other two colors once and they have not snapped so far. I like the design of the studs and the cubic zirconia parts are sparkly but sadly the quality isn't all that great if it'll snap into two pieces so easily."
2.0,"Well, I really only wanted the blue paisley design. But I had no idea that what I would get was freshly cut out mask s with incredibly flimsy thin fabric with no seams other than a seam straight up the middle of the mask, which looks to me like it could allow flow through it.  I might wear it over another mask purely for stylistic purposes – I sure wish clothes manufacturers gave a little fabric or created masks that would match the clothes!<br /><br />It might be suitable for use playing with dolls? But I don’t think it’s gonna do anything to mask the wearer."
2.0,"Lets start with the positives...These are comfortable, love the pockets, pretty blue color. Negative..These are sliders! They do not hug your waist, they slide down. I think if you have a ""bottom and hips"" which I do.....these are not for you. If you have an apple figure they would work fine ......I think."
2.0,The material was not what was expected. The heart is a &#34;felt like&#34; material and simply didn't look as good in person as the illustration.Wife thought it looked &#34;cheap&#34;. Unfortunately we do not find a way to return the outfits.
2.0,"Review edited:<br /><br />This coat is very comfy, really liked the inside. However in less than a month it ripped right down the side. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Cheap, thin and just not a good fit...i returned it"
2.0,Meh. Super cheapish. Would not buy or recommend unless you are under 15.
2.0,I loved the look of this purse but within a months time the lining developed a hole.
2.0,Not for women with breasts or shoulders.  Cheaply made as well.
2.0,The sock came w a hole. Please send me a new set.
2.0,"I ordered a large, and it was more like a XXL.  The printed so was cute, and I liked it. The style T-shirt is great. But way too large."
2.0,Order atleast one size larger than normal...maybe 2
2.0,I like this style of beanies but this one was just to big . It may be fine for someone with a large head
2.0,"Arm holes were huge, not very flattering up top but skirt was very cute!! Sad the top didn’t fit better."
2.0,Not the best material. Wouldn’t buy again
2.0,Good quilts shoe but fits a slim foot
2.0,"Would have been so nice, fit perfectly with an outfit I put together for work. But, alas it wasn’t meant to be. Size 9 was way too small for my regular size 9 feet. I’m giving them away cause it’s not worth the time and expense to send them back."
2.0,"The price was right but i thought i just got the ones nobody wanted,but i don't want to pay the shipping to send back."
2.0,I was hoping that I could wear these but they made my earring holes bleed.
2.0,They look nice but run small.  Had to return them and the price was much more for the same shoe.  Not to happy right now.
2.0,They're cute but thick. They don't really fit in 18g holes.
2.0,I have had these glasses for about 3 months and they seem to brake easy. I am just wearing them and they always brake. Went through all 3 already. Don't waste your money
2.0,"These are a strange material, coverage was good but after awhile they hurt my ears. But then I have big 👂's."
2.0,"The only downside to this skirt is that everything sticks to it, however, it didn't shrink in the wash and it looks great on!<br /><br />Update: after wearing for 2 hours, the zipper broke"
2.0,"The acrylic material is cheap looking and uncomfortable, makes you sweat immediately. It will surely pill soon.<br />Shirt is shiny because of the material, and has a knit appearance not noticeable in the pictures.<br />I got this in peach and black, won’t keep them.<br />Need cotton or cotton mix."
2.0,I had to return it.
2.0,"It's a cute shirt and arrived as I expected.<br />BUT after I washed it, it stuck to itself..full-on STATIC.<br />I've tried all kinds of ""anti-static"" products and none of them work."
2.0,It has a weird smell. I wouldn't buy this again. Quality is good and it's a really good size. I just can't get past the smell
2.0,The little magnet that keeps the band around your wrist came off within a week… I’m sure it could be super glued back in there but I shouldn’t have to do that.  I also noticed that the band did get looser on your wrist throughout the day.
2.0,Didn't like it! Too big and plain.
2.0,Fits much tighter than other sports bras that I own in the same size
2.0,"1st off I’ve worn “light compression” socks for 20 yrs.  ALL different brands.  For varicose veins.  I got these up halfway and it felt like I was cutting my leg off.  It was horrible.  Unfortunately I’d thrown away package, etc.  NEVER expecting something like this.  Especially like I said so many brands I’ve purchased.  I put a low value because of the whole package is going into the donation bin."
2.0,Quality just so so! Fine for work with blazer material thinner than expected
2.0,"The material is cheap, it is not the best quality!👎"
2.0,Legging.
2.0,"The watch worked fairly well while it lasted.  It did rub my daughter's wrist raw and I had to sew some slip-on fabric sleeves for the watch sides to protect her skin.  She needs an alarm watch for a potty reminder so she wore it every day.  For every day, normal use, this watch will not last. The slide that holds the strap down so it doesn't flap broke first.  Also, the plastic watch face became really scratched up in the first couple months so that it was hard to read the display.  Then the alarms started being inconsistent.  I replaced the battery and it worked for a bit. The battery is really hard to remove! Then the whole display was glitching and the alarms weren't working. I tried replacing the battery again but the wire connections to the vibrator snapped off and the display only shows half of each number anyway.  I'm looking for a more durable brand."
2.0,"Hard to breathe, not enough ventilation."
2.0,Bigger than anticipated.
2.0,Purchased to coordinate with a fancy navy dress with silver accents. The item is not high quality and would cheapen the look. Might be ok with casual clothes.
2.0,"I have an hourglass body shape and am 120 lbs, and I thought this would look elegant, but unfortunately, it does not fit me well at all. It makes me look chubby and without any discernible shape. The way it drapes over the torso and waist is very unflattering. I felt frumpy and didn’t want anyone to see me in it. Perhaps another body type would look better.<br />The material and rich color are lovely. I wish that were enough, but alas, I will be donating it."
2.0,"I thought it would have  a bigger knot and the charm would be bigger. Overall it's a nice bracelet, but the sizing is for a very small wrist, I don't think it would withstand ""adjusting"" on a daily basis. Make the knot and charm bigger, and you would have a REALLY nice bracelet. It's shiny, but I've only had it a few days so who knows how long that will last."
2.0,"Well,  loved the color and the skirt part.  The chest is too revealing and tiny to cover breast.  Don't recommend."
2.0,Cute dress but it’s a fitted style. I would definitely size up.  I ordered my normal size and it was way too small.
2.0,"I went off reviews but was bummed when I saw how tiny and cheap they looked.  They might be right for some craft projects, but not for mine."
2.0,The material is VERY CHEAP and FLIMSY and does not have the lively colors as depicted on the website.
2.0,"I ordered L size ,other things ok, but looks this  wig is for child? only this size?"
2.0,"As soon as we received it, I put it in the wash on delicate, inside out.  I bought the Santa dress with the red and white stripes for my 2 year old daughter's picture day at daycare.  I was looking for something casual but still cute enough for a holiday themed pic.  I took it out of the dryer (on low) and the ball on Santa's hat had fallen off. (Side note: it's also just big the right size for a young child to choke on, which I realized as soon as my 1 year old picked it up off the floor).  It looked pretty lived in, too, with strings hanging here and there.  I sewed the ball back on the hat part.  It'll still work for picture day, which is tomorrow, so I won't return it, but just be aware it's not great quality."
2.0,"It’s nice for casual no-bra days but if you’re expecting to wear this gym prepare to feel like you’re wearing one of those tank tops with the built in bra; no support or compression, stretchy, and you jiggle just as much."
2.0,"As soon as I took the shorts out the packaging, the button was already hanging on for dear life, and surely enough once I put them on, the button just plopped to the floor within 10 mins of 1st wear. Stitching and zippers look cheaply made all around and they do run a little small but maybe not to the extent everyone else has stated. Regardless, these are $5 shorts being sold for $30+, do yourself a solid and block this seller."
2.0,"Smelly, and they are not true to size. An XL is a tight L at best. Tag is written in Chinese and it's hard to verify if it's true leather and &#34;cashmere&#34;. Look somewhere else.."
2.0,"I was expecting something a little higher quality, frankly.  The material was a thin polyester that made a slightly flawed body type look positively ghastly.  I tried it on and was so turned off by both the texture of the material and the fall of the fabric that I didn't even bother trying to make it look good.  I just packed it back up and returned it.  I wouldn't recommend unless you're a 20-something who still manages to eat like a bottomless pit without putting on an ounce - these pants forgive zero flaws and might work for a manic-giggle-pixie-of-death type, but not for a business lady of indeterminate age."
2.0,"The watch looks good but the clasp won't close.<br />That makes the watch unusable, sad I have to return it."
2.0,"EDIT: less than a month of wearing this watch, the clasp is very scratched up and silver is already showing through the rose gold. I have an office job so there isn't heavy wear and tear of the watch so this is pretty disappointing. Luckily most people don't notice the clasp.<br /><br />ORIGINAL: It was a bit difficult to adjust it, not nearly as easy as they make it look in the video but I eventually got it down to about the right size.<br /><br />Like any other watch band I've had, I couldn't get the fit just right but I have to problem with every watch and bracelet so I can't hold that against this particular band.<br /><br />The black band looks great against the rose gold watch and I will definitely be buying a couple colors.<br /><br />There is a slight rubber smell that I don't love but hopefully that will disappear."
2.0,"Returned it, smaller than I thought it would be and doesn't look nearly as good as the pictures."
2.0,I thought the best had a battery inside but I had to purchase my own . Also the jacket barely gets warm all over. It only get warm in certain spots in the vest.if I had to do it again I would not have waisted my money
2.0,The wine red color isn't as vibrant and dark as the photo shown. It's more like an faded apple red color and I needed it darker. The pic color is great but actual color not so much.
2.0,"Runs Large on chest area, flaps open"
2.0,Can’t get pants over buttocks... Runs small... or I’m just getting fatter :) I kept the pants... hopefully they’ll fit one day. They would look nice with a short heel boot.
2.0,Quality is cheap. The second day it started breaking apart. The string that holds the pearl together isn’t quality at all.
2.0,The cup size was too small. I got the 2xl and it was great for the bottoms but top was too little.
2.0,did not like the fabric and the drape was too long
2.0,Material was good but it was too low for someone with large breast this dress wasn’t gonna work out.
2.0,Not at all what I was expecting was much smaller in the picture returning it right now
2.0,"The color was not true Emerald, very dark."
2.0,"The product doesn't stay on my head.  I have a &#34;small&#34; hat size, so it should fit.  It looks nice but not useful."
2.0,Very nice colors. I ordered a XXL since I know sometimes they run a bit small. It was so small my arms didn't even fit. It was more like a large. So sadly I had to return it.
2.0,The product is too small. The size tag is printed XXL and they added a third x with blue pen.
2.0,"Very cute and easy to put on, but the flower part separated from the post within 7 days if first wearing. It looks like it was just held in place by a little glue. Not a very well made product."
2.0,Loved the design and fit of the hat but I found out the hard way that the chin strap falls out of the little clip easily and the hat does not float. It sank into the lake 😞
2.0,The shirt I expected was an oversized off the shoulder adorable shirt. After reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes big and it's still very snug the kneck hole is like a t-shirt not wide at all and it's 3/4 sleeve. I will say the material is soft and comfortable and it is wearable. BUT it isn't what I wanted.
2.0,I felt like these were going to fall off my feet..... they run a half size too big for me.....
2.0,My daughter bought this ring for herself. She never wants to take it off. But the finish isn't good. It's turned an ugly copper color and it's turning her finger green. This isn't quality for daily wear and certainly not for people who wash their hands often. But if you're just looking for fun costume jewelry this works.
2.0,"The robe fits great but the tie is oddly short for a plus size. Unless this is for a special occasion to wear once, it’s not worth it."
2.0,"Not the size it says it is. Runs small . Order up , even two sizes up. Arms are cut short .<br />You know what to expect when you wash and  dry ."
2.0,"Cute, but not strong I didn’t even get to wear a pair, it fell apart as t try to put on"
2.0,"It’s a beautiful band. I was able to adjust it to fit comfortably, and loved wearing it, but it came apart unexpectedly— my watch flew and hit the pavers on the patio. My watch is destroyed. It costs almost as much as I paid for the watch to fix it.  So unhappy now."
2.0,"They cannot close tight, and they keep falling off my ears."
2.0,"Not, as a friend promised me, “actually super comfortable!” I have a sort and wider foot, and can wear either 7 or 8. I bought both, but the 7 was too small and the 8 too big. There’s just no wiggle room for a non-standard foot size with this style."
2.0,"I love the color and I love the fit, but the material is awful!!<br />It is a very rough, scratchy material and I cannot stand to have it on very long. The purchase was a waste of money unfortunately."
2.0,"Cheap, cute, & warm! I originally bought a more expensive pair, but they were really heavy, & I ended up returning them. These are light, but are holding up well so far ( about 3 months of consistent wear.) Don't know how long they'll last, but I paid &#60;$15, so I'm already pleased.<br /><br />Update: Dec 13, 2017- Soles are coming off both shoes. The right (which prob gets bent more when I drive) is almost completely off. This was not really gradual... I had them on yesterday & they were fine. I don't know if getting wet ( under 1 inch of snow) affected them that much... unfortunately, they're not really wearable in this state."
2.0,"I'm 5'7, size 14 usually and curvy. I ordered the XX large and it was a bit too small. Returning mine. I would try the XXXL but it's not available."
2.0,"The dress does not look like the right fabric, as seen online. Return, please, looks cheap!"
2.0,"Quality is cheaper than photographed and not as long inside.  Claims 6.3 inches, only 6.125."
2.0,As everyone else has stated this is printed on fabric and looks weak. The biggest let down is that there is no filter. I don’t see anywhere that there is not included.
2.0,I bought these for my husband. They squeak so he doesn't care to wear them much. He rates them a 5 out of ten in comfort when I asked. They are for wide feet.
2.0,Cheap and do not appear even on the face. Would not recommend.
2.0,Cute but very see-through so had to return.
2.0,I like the color but I have the original apple dive band and material of this one is cheap. It’s cool because it’s more flexible but I can definitely see it breaking and causing your expensive watch ultra fall on the ground. Also as a diver I would never use this band diving. Especially since the clip isn’t complete and doesn’t lock into place. I was hoping it was material similar to apple. I will keep it but never wear it doing anything in open water I also won’t purchase anymore colors. Owning the original I wouldn’t recommend anyone buy this band for the price it’s a waste of money.
2.0,Didn’t love the material and wasn’t sized right too large
2.0,Order up 1 size. Probably a one time use. So beware.
2.0,Hat is probably kids size. The shirt is probably off by a size.
2.0,"Big goofy smile on each piece, not shown in picture. Don’t want to take the time to exchange."
2.0,the pouch does not fit passports in the water resistant part of the pouch.  however that is not the main problem.  the quality of the product was a disappointment.  we took it on a vacation to alaska and the zipper on top broke after using it for one day.  we had to break open the pouch in order to get our money and passports out.  unfortunately we ordered two!  so now we have one broken one and one we are unwilling to use. all in all not a great product or experience.
2.0,When I got that it was already broken. Disappointed
2.0,Liked these shorts but they run small.
2.0,very adorable bag but the inside fabric is loud and cheap. you can hear it while walking and it’s so noisy when looking for something inside of it.
2.0,"My wife loved the top that came in navy blue, but the pink is very see through. Some may like that but the top is risque enough as it is, a little to much for her taste."
2.0,It doesn't completely go down on my head. The buckle may allow it to go to most widths but it just isn't deep enough. It feels like it just sits on top the head and doesn't wrap snug like most hats
2.0,This product is nicely constructed.  I do not like how it feels when wearing it however.  It was purchased with the idea of using it as a sleep bra and I didn't expect to feel so much tension on the back of my neck.  That part of it is really not comfortable.
2.0,"The 2 X is too small, but the design is ok!!"
2.0,Disappointed that it doesn’t stay charged very long.
2.0,Extremely heavy thick and large won’t stay on pretty but poorly designed
2.0,cheap - color coming off after less than hour usage..
2.0,Disappointed!  Tried it on and it fits for someone who has giant ears. Sticks out and is waiting for something to get stuck and rip!
2.0,It's very sheer. The dress itself is nice. I will need to return it though.
2.0,"The granddaughter got some gift cards for Christmas; she really wanted this hoodie. We ordered it for her. It looked nice, but wasn't as thick/heavy as we thought it would be, but that was okay. When we washed it however, what poor material ... it looks like a lint-ball now! Not too happy, especially for the price we paid also."
2.0,Thought these were so cute! And priced right. But they don't stay put. They are &#34;front heavy&#34; and slowly slide forward until they actually fall out. Cannot wear them for fear of losing them. They will need to go back.
2.0,Had these for one year exactly. With seasonal use they didn't not hold up. They come completely apart while on vacation.
2.0,I liked the band but one side was a different color brown than the other side.
2.0,I could not detect any help with these glasses. It’s too bad.
2.0,"Nice idea, but run time is too short.  Lumen output is not nearly enough for a post lamp."
2.0,"The material itself wasn’t bad, but the color... i wouldn’t call it white. It was faded, almost gray. If you put it next to anything white, it failed in comparison. Even when not comparing, you can see that it’s not true white.  Will be giving this away."
2.0,When I received this dress in Olive Green & also a dress in Sage Green I liked them but they were too small. I returned them in the same pkg & only recd credit for the Olive colored one. That is the reason for the low rating.. When I get the refund for the other dress I will adjust the rating.
2.0,Basically this was a standard metal business card holder that had pieces of wrapped cardboard glued to either side of it to make it look pretty. It's fairly easy to peel the pieces of cardboard off and I'm sure with use the corners would get dinged pretty badly. It didn't cost much so it wasn't a great loss.
2.0,"It arrived sooner than expected which was nice. It didn't fit me how I'd hoped though, it's too tight. I even tried taking the pads out, it's just uncomfortable. I'm 5'4'' 130 and I wear a 34 C ..if you have a very small frame I'm sure it fits nicely. Thankfully it wasn't too spendy. Not worth the price of returning it."
2.0,Cute dress but incredibly cheap material. You’ll only get 2 or 3 wears out of it before the seems rip. Fits tts
2.0,"I'm a small or xs in everything - figured one size would be fine... fits me snug but definitely stretches.  I just prefer a little more room.  If you're a Large or XL, one size does NOT fit all."
2.0,Don't like the shape
2.0,"It works, in that it covers and stays put. That said by the end of the day I’m tempted to go all Helen Reddy and burn it because it’s so godawfully uncomfortable. I’m the first to admit that I’m a bit of a delicate flower when it comes to restrictive garments, but holy cow this  bra is like torture after 8 hours."
2.0,"Way too many straps! It’s such a substantial sandal with all those straps, it might as well be a shoe."
2.0,Terrible product! Very cheaply made and quality is terrible color scratches off
2.0,the 2 snap buttons on the belt are two close together that limits the belt buckels you can ware with it for that reason i would not buy another other wise i would.
2.0,Were small and didn't really provide the comfort.
2.0,"While these look nice, after one week of wear the sparkles are already falling off. My niece wears them to play Elsa dress up. She’s 5. But I expected them to hold up longer than a week. Will not purchase again."
2.0,Much lighter than picture would have you think. Also I have a pretty big head and they are too wide for me
2.0,"This was listed as two gloves, but is only one."
2.0,Color was right. I was hoping for a oversized comfy tank. It was more like a standard straight across boxy men’s tank top in my opinion. Picture the ones you’d find in a little tourist town print shop where they bought 500 Russel athletic tanks in bulk to print “I’m with stupid” on. (Or whatever other catchy phrase you might like 😁) The bow on the back just looks so dumb. I couldn’t come up with any other adjective and I really don’t want to slam this seller. Wasn’t what I was hoping.
2.0,"Good for a Lightning McQueen fan, but obviously a bit cheap. Lightning McQueen had no pupils on one of the pairs of socks."
2.0,"These are cute, but really stiff.  They don't seem like they'll last long.  (Nothing else to say but the review wants more words.)"
2.0,"Ordered the brown striped sweater. Color was not brown, it's a brick red. Looks and feels very cheaply made. Buttons are cheap plastic. Fit is fine. I'm 5ft7 34in waist DDD and got a large. Feel is soft, but on the verge of itchy. Glad I only paid $13.99 for it. Still probably only worth paying about $5."
2.0,"I bought this to wear for my birthday which is May 26. I received it on May 20 which was fine with me. I love the look. It's beautiful, but it really pissed me off that the silver stones were coming off immediately as I took the garment out the plastic. (Birthday fit ruined) Also when I tried it on, more of the silver stones fell off. They are just coming off for no reason at all. You guys should do a better job with securing those silver stones on the clothing. I really wanted to wear this for my birthday. 😞👎🏽"
2.0,I ordered 3 sizes bigger and still small.. sorry I returned
2.0,The item runs big
2.0,"Pictures show a hood but there was no hood on the top, so returning them."
2.0,"They are pretty cheaply made, but I guess I should've expected that from the price.  Scratch very easily and just aren't very sturdy.  I am giving them to my 6 year old daughter that just loves them."
2.0,I tried for hours and could not attach to the case back.  I'm not a novice watch collector either. Virtually impossible to install without permanent damage to the lugs.
2.0,Too big the color were brown and white doesn't work that's my first time buying I don't like
2.0,Not what I was expecting! One of the earrings was broken:(
2.0,Runs small and cheap material
2.0,"As others have shown, my garment also ripped within hours of my first time wearing it out. It split down the seams of both legs. The material didn’t bother me and the fit was great, but clearly it was poorly made. I bought a medium so I would have extra length since I’m 5’8” but I usually wear a small. It was pretty loose on, but with the tie at the waist, it still looked cute. There’s no reason it should have ripped aside from clearly being of poor quality. I’m definitely bummed because it was super cute!"
2.0,"Two of the pairs fit perfectly. The third was a different design, despite similar markings on the package, and would not stay on."
2.0,"I am sending this back today......not at all what I had in mind.  I thought it would be very soft, however, the material was rather rough, also too thin, and just didn't fit nicely."
2.0,For an extra large head.
2.0,"Size small<br />Fabric is poor quality. However, the design of the dress is super cute."
2.0,It did not come with any protective covering on the face or most of the band. As a result it arrived scratched on the face and a little bit on the band too and I had to return it. It looked like it worked fine but I expected to get a new watch and I do not think I received that.
2.0,"The very first wash the threads on the pickets started to unravel, the label started washing out, and the conversion chart lost most of its color. I haven't even worn it and its pockets are already threatening to come loose :("
2.0,Haven't worn it yet. Just tried it on briefly. The material is that of a full body swimming suit. Best way to describe. I'll probably donate.
2.0,The seller says they are cotton but they don’t feel like it. They did however shrink in the wash and the thumb hole is now super tight and I have small hands.
2.0,Pure hard cheap fragile plastic
2.0,So disappointed in sewing
2.0,Beautiful but very small. Even if you have small boobs it probably wouldn't fit
2.0,It is cute and comfy but too short. I'm sure it is perfect for some people (specifically younger and thinner people). I still wear it around the house because it is comfortable.
2.0,Runs really small ..... sent it back!
2.0,Color was darker than pictured and not what I wanted. Jacket was also not material I thought it would be
2.0,"Reviews were raving--must have been paid people. The measurements technically matched what was listed, but proportions WAY off. Looked like a 3-year-old trying on my mom's dress.  The fabric is a bit stiff and weird, but I will say--favorably--the color is quite saturated and bright.  I don't expect perfection from a garment that was mailed, but it had a bit of discoloration on the front from pressed in seams/zipper along the front which was noticeable (hard to tell from photo light, but still included) I don't think the dents would come out unless dry cleaned/ironed again. I purchased for the style and the price, but it's worth the time to return. I'm sure it looks lovely on anyone of above average height."
2.0,This shirt didn't look like the photo and it seem
2.0,Bras
2.0,"I was looking for an oversized sweater and this seemed perfect. When I received it i was excited. I loved the color and feel. I was concerned that it looked like it might pull it snag easily. When I put it on it was not oversized and got like a regular sweater. I was so disappointed. I wear 3x. This sweater fit, but wasn't oversized. I returned it. Disappointed customer. False advertising!"
2.0,I ordered to large.
2.0,"Doesn't stay on and the wire is so stiff, it isn't adjustable at all!"
2.0,"I agree with the other buyer - this looks much cheaper than what is shown in the picture.  The fit was as expected, but the sequins are spaced out on mesh and the mermaid tail looks like it's made of Lycra so it's flimsy and doesn't look like the picture.  I don't recommend this costume and am only giving it 2 stars because it he sizing was accurate. Hoping I can get a refund."
2.0,The chain is nice but the pendent part is bent. Very flimsy
2.0,"These socks looked like they would be really exceptional from the posting. I wear a sized 12 shoe so the large are advertised to fit 9.5-12. The socks are advertised as thick. The socks are too small on me and not very thick at all. I was disappointed in these socks at how thin they were. I did like the looks and the extra piece on the back that helps cushion the back of the foot. I gave them 2 stars because of these things I did like. They appear to be made well, but I couldn't even wear them for very long to determine a best guess as to how well they might hold up."
2.0,"Hard to put in,"
2.0,Not army green at all. LIME GREEN. Bright lime green. Not the dark green (army green) in picture.
2.0,"More like a swimsuit cover up unless you have a 24"" waist. I have a 28"" waist and does not cover up the bits..."
2.0,The polyester is too thin and slippery. Doesn't hold any warmth.
2.0,"I'm a 33 in.  waist, got a medium, they are way too small for my package. Can barely squeeze my junk inside. Also, there is no protective strip of material inside the zipper.  Be very careful when unzipping or you could be in for some serious pain."
2.0,"Problem with this dress is there is no zipper so you have to pull it over your head. Waistline is very fitted, not stretchy, so could not pull it over my bustline. Cute style, but no way to actually get It on my body."
2.0,"Super cute when it stayed on my ear. Didn’t really fit my ear well and when I went to bend it to shape, one of the butterflies broke off. You might have better luck if it fits your ear from the start."
2.0,"Thought it would be more  shinier,dull looking"
2.0,This was more of an aqua blue than a teal
2.0,"I wish this worked out. I'm 5' 0"" with a short torso and somehow the knot could only come up just above my belly button. I wanted it to work because it is cute but it just looks odd and was way too low."
2.0,Got a medium and it's very stiff and boxy looking.  I'm not exactly a model but this shirt is not flattering or even comfortable.  I don't even want to keep it for sleeping in.
2.0,"The jacket fits beautifully and is so warm... but the zipper keeps busting out from the bottom. I do not have time not the patience to return it, im just going to go to seamstress and have the zipper fixed- but damn really? The best jacket. I knew it was too good to be true- Amazon is turing into the new WISH app for adults."
2.0,"Cute shirt...quality is a little shoddy. For a shirt costing around $25, I'd expect the shirt to be made a little better. It's not like it was exactly inexpensive. I think I'll still wear it. With the right outfit and a bit of ironing I think I can make it work.<br /><br />Update: yeah, the black dye from the shirt has now turned my $40 manicure black as well. Minus one more star for that. Wouldn't recommend..."
2.0,would have loved this for fit and style - but both the material on the black and grey pilled up after only the first wash
2.0,The color of the dress is accurate but the dress is see through so you can only wear it as a bathing suit cover.
2.0,"Don't spend the money, more work than it's worth and even then I am unsure I will actually be able to use. Hat comes very wrinkled and the wrinkles don't come out all together. Plus as pictured my product came damaged out of the box. High note, delivered as quoted."
2.0,The turquoise color on the band has faded to white in less than 1 week. It looks really 'cheesy'.  Nothing like the sample that is shown.
2.0,It's just alright. I get asked why my shirt is inside out everytime I wear it. It fits kind of like a bag and even though it's V-neck it doesn't accentuate the girls like most V-necks do. Not the worst purchase I've ever made but far from the best. I've started just wearing it as pajamas or lounge wear.
2.0,It doesn't work don't get no earth from it
2.0,"Its smaller than expected, before purchasing it i asked if it had a clasp and i was answered by the company that it did but it doesnt and its super long so when you wear it it doesnt show"
2.0,"Super cute, but I purchased for the gold plating, I've worn for two days and already have a green belly button and it's getting infected (mind you, it's been pierced for over 10 years, it doesnt really get infected anymore.)"
2.0,Women's fit t-shirt. I ordered 3xl and it was too small. I usually wear 2xl. Too short and too tight.
2.0,I’ve ordered other formals on Amazon. This has so far been the poorest quality. Sequins very spaced out. Material is like plastic and very itchy. The waist was not fitted like shown in picture which took away from other curves. The v on the front was not as deep as shown. It would do ok if you didn’t have other options. But I chose not to wear it to my event.
2.0,"I waited to write a review on this set of earrings, so I could give a review of how they are.<br /> They are definitely cute looking at rings. They no way look like they are real diamonds. However, they do look nice.<br />I gave it to stars because after wearing them on the fourth or fifth time can’t remember. The piece that you would pull out of your ear came I’m done and if I did not have long fingernails it would’ve become stuck in my ear. Or I would’ve been forced to pull it through the hole of my  piercing. I would not recommend this earring to anyone, just because of that. It could’ve been a real medical emergency.<br />I gave it to stars because it really did not cost me a lot of money. However it probably deserves one star."
2.0,"It is somewhat mis-shapen in design. Circumference around my head was fine, but the top part would always lays an ugly looking pancake on my head unless I jammed the hat down over my ears. The loops to hold the neck shield and face mask seem mispositioned, stretching the front sides of the neck shield a little far forward bending the hat from front to back. The face shield loops seem a little too far back. Can't easily attach the shields wearing the hat. Net result is it's a little hard to get hat on with everything is attached. It is both too small and too large at the same time. Color seemed like a pale yellow. Returned it."
2.0,"This was clearly not sterling silver, even though it was  listed as such. For such a low price I perhaps should've known better, but I was shocked by how cheap it looked."
2.0,Clearly they just sent someone else’s return. No tags and unbuttoned. Slightly damp. It’s an ok dress. I will keep it anyway to wear around the house but strings hanging everywhere and not true to size. (Medium is more like a large.)
2.0,"it is beautiful, but too big and I wish I was able to get a smaller size."
2.0,"I really hate to give it two stars.  I wanted to like it.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this was the bust.  I am 40DD, and even though the buttons are looped elastic, no way I could keep them from gapping.  This is not a regular button up dress which would be covered wherever you are buttoned.  I could definitely see them being a problem.  If you are buying this for a swimsuit pullover then you might like it.<br /><br />The material is thin, which was o.k. for me, except it would definitely show through on summer days.  I also don't believe it was worth more than maybe $15.  I'm surprised the others like it so well, but if you are busty, I suggest you size up.  Then I'm not sure how the rest would fit.<br /><br />I gave the XL to my daughter because I just am not one to return things (who is about a size Small normally)"
2.0,Good fit but low quality. Lace separating. Returned
2.0,shoe was too heavy and too narrow
2.0,"too big... too thick, actually to thick"
2.0,"These Ristake socks are made from 76% combed cotton, 14% spandex, and 10% elastic.<br /><br />I’ve worn, washed, and dried the socks a few times. The heels are already starting to wear, with some broken threads. I’m not sure how long these socks will last.<br /><br />From the very first time I wore them, the socks fell down my legs constantly, as if the stretchiness was already worn out. I have them on as I write this review and I just had to tug them up.<br /><br />The socks seem to run small. I wear a 7.5 men’s shoe, the X-Large in these socks fits comfortably without being too big. I don’t have large calves, yet I can see white in the pattern from how the sock has stretched to fit my legs."
2.0,"I was so excited to get this watch because it was so pretty. I thought the magnetic metal band was super cool, but the magnet  didn't last long enough. I lost the rubber grommet that goes around the magnet, and the magnet lost the holding power, so it does not stay tight."
2.0,I bought the white and black lace band on July 21st. Within 2 weeks a weird orange color started showing up on the band. More discoloration has continued to show up. I love the band but the orange color showing up all over the band now is upsetting!<br />I do not use any harsh cleaners either.  Anything I can do??
2.0,Cheaply made! Would never buy this brand again
2.0,"Although they are comfortable, the soles ran down extremely quickly. I have had them for a couple of months & there is no cushion left whatsoever."
2.0,"My son loves this jacket and then zipper slide came off and I can't get it back on!  Too late to return, Amazon has no more in stock and now I have to pay to get it fixed.  Not happy 😒"
2.0,Runs small.Not what I expected..
2.0,Bought this dress in the Navy in a size small. I am 5’2” with a 26in waist and this dress was way too loose around the waist. I returned the item.
2.0,It's a nice bracelet but small not for bigger wrist like a child wrist
2.0,"Pointy edges, scratched my wrist. The slide dangled down into everything like have a sleeve that was constantly too long."
2.0,"Too small width-wise, didn't really like the material or the ribbon belt/tie. Will be returning."
2.0,Meh. Does not look like picture.  Way shorty Judy makes me look hippy
2.0,"It's just too flimsy, even for aluminum stock."
2.0,cut irregular uneven front lace too narrow doesnt cover side to side got a refund
2.0,The earrings were too small to fit in my conch piercing so I couldn’t wear any of them except for the U looking one. They are very nice but don’t fit
2.0,BEAUTIFUL.  However after only three months the zipper has come off track.  I only used sparingly because I have several others to use.
2.0,Received a refund in no time.  I then purchased another pair of pants from amazon.  The pants were less expensive and fit perfectly.
2.0,Poor quality shirt
2.0,"Too small and very cheep, not worth it."
2.0,Really wanted to love this but the plastic used in the shoulder seams pokes my skin and is pretty uncomfortable. I don't think I'm particularly sensitive to these things but who knows. Maybe it doesn't bother everyone else.
2.0,Size small fits more like a large
2.0,Watch was way too small to be for men....gave it to my girlfriend....
2.0,I’m 5’5 and 237lbs but my weight is in my legs and butt. So i like shirts to accentuate my curves and this shirt does NOT - but maybe that was my fault for buying a shirt in this design so I didn’t rate it really on that aspect. I rated it low because the boob section is too small and the shirt gets caught over my boobs if i raise my arms and I have to keep pulling it down. The flow of the waist is not flattering and baggy/large and arms are too small. The bigger sizes don’t account for big chests or arms.
2.0,"I didn't like them. Too big, too wide. Very firm and looks uncomfortable. Returned."
2.0,Showed up broken I was supposed to take it to kohl's to refund it which made no sense it's cool looking but garbage toy
2.0,"I'll be returning this shirt. It's actually blue and white, not black and white, well at least the one I received is. And it's very boxy shaped.  No, I wasn't expecting a fancy, body flattering shirt by any means, but this isn't what I wanted."
2.0,"Very cute but hoop broke, 2nd time wearing it."
2.0,This was very tight across the chest.  Not at all loose or flowy.
2.0,"Not cotton, no shape at all, just a really large sack."
2.0,"Will wear as beach cover-up or nightie.<br />I ordered XL based on reviews. My US size is 12.<br />It's an empire waist.<br />I found the elastic band under the bust unflattering, making both bust and midriff appear way too large, and I'm not big in either area.<br />The horizontal stripes at the top seem uneven making my chest look lopsided.<br />I snipped out some of the elastic band around the high waist, making holes I'll need to sew up, but it looks better flowing straight instead of the unusual under the bust cinching that the elastic band causes.<br />Note to manufacturer: lose the elastic band, it looks much better without it.<br />Oh, and one of the pockets wasn't sewn at the bottom. I'll have to mend that too."
2.0,I dislike the product Blazers Jacket  because the style did not fit me good too small .the style is great.
2.0,Sent back didn’t like the material. Not what I was looking for.
2.0,I love the design but when I tried it on it kind of riped because I wear a size 34D or 36D and even bigger then that too. If u wear my size don't buy it. And I think it won't fit on a c .
2.0,"As the title says.  I should have known that NO 925 sterling silver ring would EVER be less than $4.00. When I got it I couldn't believe how fake it felt.  It felt like plastic.  The size fits nicely though & I love the designof it, but that is about it.  I also should have read the description better.  Since when are you not allowed to wear a REAL sterling silver ring while doing any real work.  I had to laugh when I read ""Do not expose to the air for long periods of time.""  Really??  Well I wore it to be & it is now sitting on my bathroom sink.  You get what you pay for a grocery store trinket.."
2.0,the necklace broke in my hand when i went to lift it up to my neck.
2.0,The ring is more of a silver than a black and the gem stone if far lighter than the purple. The picture makes the ring look like a black ring with a purple highlight. But it is mostly purple. If that i want you want that is fine. It's just not what i expected.
2.0,I feel like this was okay but there were a lot of issues. Seams were disconnected and I could see the hot glue where they used it. One of the ears were not connected. Looks poorly put together. The ears are not nearly as big as they look In the pictures. It looks more like mouse ears. Won't be having my daughter wear this.
2.0,"A little thin and a little tight fitting. straps not the best quality, one  broke when trying one on"
2.0,"I bought these based on past purchases because Zombailon’s cut is great for me. However the fabric for these is… slippery? For lack of a better word. These kept falling off my butt and TRUST that is not usually a problem. Don’t like, wouldn’t wear on the daily."
2.0,I cannot open it up to put a picture under the frame. I will have to order another locket to suit my purposes.  I am so disappointed.
2.0,Too flimsy. Won’t stay on your head.<br />Doesn’t cover your entire vision area.<br />Not worth $20.
2.0,Doesnt fit well at all. Not true to size.
2.0,"The fabric felt as if it would “pill” badly after the first wash.  The fit was ok and was roomy enough for my 40F bust (unfortunately it’s natural).  But being only 5’2”, the length was too long - about 5” .  Returning, not in mood to hem!"
2.0,"Cheaply made. As I was taking the stick pins out of the shirt, it left holes and the skirt start to fray in that area. I forgot the cost of these shirts but if its more than $5 I would not waste money. I didn't send them back because my son will be wearing a suit and no one will see the holes other than that I would have returned the shirt. Even the tie is cheaply made. The picture is an illusion, the quality is not as pictured."
2.0,"I have short legs and these shorts don't go far down towards my ankles as the picture shows, very disappointed, I like the fabric and the size chart is wrong also I ordered size 36 and got XXL which their chart says that's 38 waist."
2.0,"The material feels very cheap, it's not breathable at all and it's very clingy.  They were also considerably shorter that pictured."
2.0,Super see through. No compression. Little support. I'm going back to Fabletics. Those suckers hold it in!
2.0,I really want to love these shoes. But I just can’t completely. I ordered a 8 in the tan. But they were way to roomy. I had to get inserts to make them fit better and double my bootie socks.<br /><br />I then ordered a black 7.5. And I could barely fit into them! That was without a sock. Sizing is way too weird. But I love the look and have gotten a lot of compliments from others.
2.0,The disposable concept I great but the opening tears when I put over my husband's head
2.0,This band is hard to put on your watch and extremely hard to remove.
2.0,I was really excited to get this bag because I have been on the lookout for a nice bucket bag. This bag is not soft whatsoever. It feels almost like a very stiff paper bag. Not something to wear crossbody at all. Returned
2.0,Super duper sad. I bought this purse for a friend and the zipper inside the purse was broken and the purse arrived dirty. Just disappointed. If you are going to buy this purse shop around and try to in a store so you can check it out IRL.
2.0,I thought it was elastic in the loop part and it's hard plastic.
2.0,material is scratchy and it doesn't look as cool as the pictures
2.0,"Stayed lit, but the “ shoe string” broke after the 2nd time of wearing them, & then the other shoe caught a shortage. Not worth the money"
2.0,The edge hem stitching is poor.  It doesn't look like this picture.  I am disappointed.  The color scheme is incorrect.
2.0,The description said that it was 11 inches wide.  It was a little over 9 inches wide.  The opening at the top is small.  I returned it.
2.0,"This jumpsuit is extremely see through and the pocket stands out through the material giving it a cheap look. It is definitely not as shown, as the pictured material appears firmer and thicker quality. If this was made from any other material i probably would've kept it as it was made well and the cut of the material does suit shapely women. It is also a bit on the long side, i am 5ft 4&#34; and it still touched the ground in heels. I have returned for a refund."
2.0,Glue all over the gems. I will not wear it.
2.0,Fell apart very quickly.
2.0,"The sizing chart is spot on. If you normally wear a medium, a medium will fit just right. I'm sure the same goes for the other sizes as well. Other than the jacket fitting, I was extremely disappointed with this product. The neck opening is so wide that several inches of your tee-shirt show, which looks strange. The jacket is made from a cheap, scratchy material that is very uncomfortable. The Velcro straps along the waist bunch up the jacket and make it look frilly. The picture makes the jacket look awesome, but it just doesn't hang the way that it should. I've worn the jacket maybe 10 times, and finally just hung it up and got the old leather jacket back out. You get what you pay for. If you buy a cheap jacket, you'll get a jacket that has made several compromises."
2.0,Doesn't look as good in real- the color and quality looks different in hand than online.
2.0,The dress is nice but the material started to become a little grainy on the side
2.0,It fit and seemed well made but it leaked from the coke end and I could never get it to stop.
2.0,"The shirt was shorter than expected, the sleeves are tight, the back fold kept unfolding, the fabric is THIN and the straps are in an awkward spot. Plus the way the front looks in the ad is not how it looked on (Definitely not for big chested women) it was cute and comfortable though"
2.0,Ordered a 2xl..usually I am a large/xl but I read reviews to size up and they are still too small
2.0,"I am petite (5'0""), and the Small was too large.  The shoulders are very wide and it makes for an awkward fit. Too bad!"
2.0,"size of top was too small, pant also but top is 2 or 3 size smaller"
2.0,Weird Material
2.0,Disappointed in the inaccurate sizing.
2.0,I chose the Pink one ..  Cheap material and  it was a weird length ..  Would not wear it over 70 degrees.
2.0,"I didn't expect much for the price, but these are terrible.  Way too small and threads were hanging off them all over.  Don't recommend."
2.0,"I wasn't a fan of the material and it doesn't look like the picture, color not as bright and doesn't flow. It's like paper maybe after I wash it but still I bought xl and it fits small, I can't button it but still wearable as an open shirt over a tank and some shorts or jeans. We will see."
2.0,Dislike color
2.0,Nice looking hat!
2.0,Bought two.  Each broke within 3 months.  Plastic around the attachment is very flimsy.
2.0,"I didn't like the fabric. It was rough and cheap looking. And the fit wasn't very good. It didn't hang right. The color was nice, but I had to return it."
2.0,"It was fine, I just didn’t prefer the material."
2.0,"I loved the look and feel  of this, but the size runs small.  I would reccomend ordering a couple of sizes up.  I ordered a small because that is is what wear in all my shirts, but it was way too snug and short.  I gave this one to my daughter and ordered a large.  I haven't gotten it yet, but hoping for a better fit.  I only gave two stars based on the fit alone since it hasn't been worn or washed yet."
2.0,"A cheep hat, but you get what you pay for"
2.0,To small for an adult
2.0,I got this product yesterday and it’s botton is very weak!! Disappointed with this product!! Seems low quality!
2.0,I give it 2 just because it looked good when you first get it. After wearing it for 3 days it was no good
2.0,"Beware, they turn your fingers green. Each one of them."
2.0,"I don’t recommend wearing this if you plan to shower, swim, bathe, or sweat. It is super cheaply made. Not made from stainless steel, so you’ll likely have green skin if you wear this for a prolonged period of time."
2.0,Too tight in the upper arms and huge everywhere else.
2.0,Love the dress but it was damage I couldn’t zip the dress because it was broken underneath the dress was ripped and the smell of the dress is awful.
2.0,"Ordered this for my 10yo and ordered the size suggested,  but it was no where close.  The ankles were at her knees and the wrist were at her elbows. And she's small for her age."
2.0,"I'm very petite, 5'0&#34;, 112 lbs and the wrap dress in size small was tight through the chest and waist. Beautiful drape and the colors, blue and yellow were just as pictured. Disappointed in the fit, had to wear a tank underneath which took away from the dress."
2.0,"So, these compression shorts are some of the worst I’ve ever experienced. The fitment on mine are not good at all. Not sure why they’re meant for, but not for someone that likes the squat rack. According to the sizing chart, I should be in a large. Yet somehow the crotch is too short, and they’re cut more like low rise briefs, they don’t come up far enough? I’ll keep them for a a week and see if they get better, or if I get used to them. I’ll update as needed, but so far, I can’t recommend these with a clean conscience."
2.0,"Cute dress, didn’t expect it to be a suede-like material. I am top heavy but the dress was very spacious for my bust. The hip area was too tight and I don’t have large hips or a big backside. Would not buy again."
2.0,Bought a photochromic lens for my oakley badman.  Lens are of good quality.  The only problem is that the left lens is a little loose and moves when you wipe it.  The cut might not be exact.  Disappointing.
2.0,Good wallet. Has enough space.<br /><br />The clasp broke like the moment I got it. :( I spent alot of money and was expecting it to last awhile (6 months+) but it just popped off like it wasn't even secured right. Sadly I can't afford to get a new wallet. ☹️ Would not recommend.
2.0,Cheaply made. Suits the purpose
2.0,"Not flattering. I'm 5'5"" size 8. This dress may work for someone taller & thinner."
2.0,Material not at all as advertised but refund was hassle-free.
2.0,The dress is NOT this color. It is dark purple. I got a medium and it looked like an extra small.<br />The dress's workmanship is fine.
2.0,They are soft and comfortable but only a single layer of fabric. The description mentions lining but only one layer of fabric so not warm.
2.0,The earrings are tiny.  Was going to give to my daughter but now to granddaughter.  I looked at the pics thought that was a women with them in her ears.
2.0,The bracelet fell apart when she put it on
2.0,"You will definitely need to purchase a new chain<br />It was not long enough for a child<br />So obviously, it would not fit anyone"
2.0,IT runs big and this is the women’s size. I ordered the men one. Sent it back.. the pink one is cute.. but the visor is big and hat is not fitted. I will alter it myself probably..
2.0,"I just received my plugs and while they all seem to be the correct size and of sound quality, the box they came in was cracked and slightly broken and three of the plugs were broken."
2.0,Too tight (ordered XL) and the straps were a plastic-esque material not faux leather or pleather. The material had a sheen to it making it appear like a costume. Returned.
2.0,I don’t like the way the criss cross shoulders appear to “hang” off of my shoulders. I have broad shoulders because I lift weights and thought this would compliment them but it looks funny so I haven’t worn it out.
2.0,To thin.
2.0,Just received this order and the pockets are sewn in upside down!! Unusable feature.😫
2.0,Lasted 3 wks. I had hoped that the previous reviews that I have read before I bought this were just quality control issues here and  there . Unfortunately that was not the case I barely had this 3 weeks when I bent down to pick up something the belt detached the little piece that held the belt to the buckle on there was basically the reverse deal broke previous reviews show a picture of it Too bad it was a good looking belt and structurally built aside from that which is the main thing is obviously a major part that  holds it together defeats the purpose of belt maybe They will  fix that in the future .
2.0,Fabric is very thin. Not very happy
2.0,"I usually go for XL or 2X but to be safe, I ordered this top 1-2 sizes bigger than what I would normally order and the bust is WAY too small.  As in so small, the stitching sits between my collar bone and bust, which is just SO unfortunate because the fabric and pattern is exactly what I wanted.  Please note, there is not even the tiniest amount of stretch in this item, none whatsoever.  I’m hesitant to even exchange it because it’s a daily game of Russian roulette in regards to this items sizes, prime status and return policy.  When I initially ordered, my chosen size(3x) was eligible for prime with free returns and now the 3x and 4x are not prime eligible and charge for shipping with no guarantee of free returns.  If you are not busty this might be perfect for you, but for those that are you may end up as sorely disappointed as I am."
2.0,wasnt really a fan of the bottoms as there was no liner in the crotch and the seam was very uncomfortable to my 8 year old. Also day 1 in the pool the colors ran so now it looks more tie dyed. sizes run very small.
2.0,Too large in crotch area of shorts.
2.0,"Working in construction, these pants don’t hold up. Multiple rips in legs. Had them about 2 months."
2.0,It was way more orange than what I was hoping for.  The purse itself is very nice.  I just didn't like the color at all.  Nothing like the picture.
2.0,Be sure to measure this  Accessories First Star Plaid Scarf. The product page states that it is 180 inches long and 36 inches wide. The one I received was 69 inches + 3.5 inches of fringe and 14 inches wide. It is the same  soft 100% acrylic material and made well in Germany........just not the size marketed. The three sparkly stars added to the bottom of one side are adhered firmly and a nice holiday touch.
2.0,"I don't like it. they or very tiny, good for a 3 month old baby.  I will give them to a baby."
2.0,I understood I bought a lot of 4 luggage straps...but only came one!! Really mad!!
2.0,"This bag would be perfect if not for one unfortunate flaw - the hanger hook.  I loaded up my suit and went on my way, only to find that the hook allowing you to hang this bag is tiny.  I expected to be able to hang this in a closet if I wanted - or in the coat closet of a plane when travelling.  I took this with me on a flight and actually had to bend the hook for it to fit on the bar of the coat closet of the plane I was on.  It is unfortunate because everything else about this bag is perfect.  Just put a normal clothes-hanger-sized hook on it and this would be 5 stars - no question."
2.0,The mask itself is very good. It arrived in a timely fashion and included a couple of filters. BUT...the color is all wrong! It is not Longhorn Burnt Orange. It is an orangey shade of red! Not even close to the picture that is on the order site. That's why the 2 star review.
2.0,I had ordered the tan/khaki color and they fit great but got the blue color also and they way to small.
2.0,Lenses are OK replacements. Not as clear as original Arnette lenses.
2.0,sharp edges
2.0,At first I loved this skirt but after a couple wear the pockets and zipped ripped.
2.0,"I love this dress.  It fits well, and I like the overall design, but my issue is that it smells horrible!  I could smell it as soon as I took it out of the bag and even after hanging it out for a couple of weeks the smell was still there.  I liked it enough to try washing it to get rid of the smell.  Although the smell wasn't as strong it was still there.  Even after washing it a 2nd time, it is still smelly.  It is like a chemical smell.  I don't know if this is the die on the fabric, or what, but if it didn't smell, I would have given it 5 stars."
2.0,"med. nice hat has the ribbon to fit the hat and drawstrings to keep the hat snug in the wind. However, the TPU shield did not get packed with it, so sadly what I bought it for it is useless."
2.0,"These were useless for my 5 year old. He wears 11.5 so I ordered 12 and they are so narrow at the tip that his foot doesn't fit all the way inside. They look nice and the fur inside feels soft and warm, but I would have needed another size larger at least to use these."
2.0,"Not true to size runs really small, all though material is really good"
2.0,This product was okay. You have to make sure your boobs are super dry and place them correctly because they will lift oh the sides constantly.
2.0,"Quality seemed great, but the size chart is no where near accurate.  Bought two of these for my boys. One very slim 7 year old and one bigger 5 year old and neither one fit.  Bought them both a size 6, which based off the sizing chart they were both at the lower end of the measurements and neither one of them fit into the suit.  They were way to small.  Had to return both."
2.0,Poor value for your money don't buy
2.0,My husband was very disappointed.
2.0,"The earrings look ok from a distance, but up close not so much.  The black faceted ones are plastic or resin.  The prongs are scratchy and catch on fabrics.  The others were fine for my purpose."
2.0,"Very disappointed, these are false photos, I received a mid-calf length, they definitely are short.  Do not expect ankle length, other than that, fabric is soft and heavy, flows fresh. Black is true to color."
2.0,The quality is super poor for this product. I'm not sure it would hold up very well in wash based on quality of print. I won't find out though because I'm returning despite it being a good price
2.0,These are my second pair in the past month and they keep breaking. The glasses themselves are cool and good looking but they are fragile. Poorly crafted and not sturdy enough to last over a month.
2.0,not great for long thick hair
2.0,"Love the length and the pockets on this, and the material is quality thickness, but the cut of this is not right if you are large chested. The empire waist hangs at an odd level because of the chest, so this has to be returned."
2.0,"I liked the look and feel, but unfortunately they broke the second time I wore them. The earpiece broke off. They were actually hanging on the collar of my shirt when I looked down and saw the earpiece on the floor."
2.0,It's really cute but the metal clasp gave me painful rash. I'm not generally sensitive/ allergic to much so it's odd that I had such a bad reaction to this.
2.0,Highly dislike how the pattern looks in person- extremely cheap looking but you get what you pay for!
2.0,I didn't even get to wear my earring it messed up right when I was trying to put the back piece on..
2.0,"The product arrived quickly and looked just like the picture. The problem that I am having with it is the ball screw is completely stuck on the belly button ring. I can't get it off so I can't even wear this. It really does look just like the photo though, which is why I didn't give it 1 star, but because it is stuck it is useless to me."
2.0,The dress is beautiful! The only thing is that it was definitely a returned dress. There are little stains at the bottom of the dress. Smh. Kind of snug so if you are in between sizes definitely size up!
2.0,"It is a nice hat, but it is too large for me. Sad..."
2.0,Only one of the three pairs is usable. I am going to fix them as my daughter was super excited about these earrings. Other than them being broken they are cute.
2.0,I ordered L and is to small for me.
2.0,Polyester material. Not cotton as description.
2.0,Arrived with a broken zipper and the wallet will not close properly. Very disappointed because I like the look and feel of it. Waiting on refund.
2.0,These glasses may look really cool but they will not last long.  Cheap build.  Weak springs.  Lens will pop out if you don't gingerly clean them.  There are better choices readily available.  I do not recommend.
2.0,"As a protective phone case, it works fine. I've dropped my phone several times and the case has protected it from damage, and the buttons and cutouts are properly located. However, I ordered this particular case because of the Doctor Who image on the back, and in that aspect it's a miserable failure. The artwork is a very thin layer surface print on a white case. After only six months it had big white scratches where the image rubbed off, and now after a year you can barely tell what image it's supposed to be. I carry it in my front pants pocket with nothing harsher than a tissue because I'm worried about scratching the camera lens, and carefully set it down on the charger, but the graphic scratched off anyway. If you can't resist the image, maybe applying a clear coat of nail polish or mod podge would help preserve it. For a Whovian, this case is a disappointment."
2.0,Item came broken. The Velcro was falling off and I had to see it back on. It’s too small for me and I’m a size 4. I’m going to have to pin it to fit Me.
2.0,I'm usually a size 12-14 and ordered an XXL and it is skin tight and I need to return. Disappointed... the size chart is not accurate.
2.0,“Fearless” not visible to naked eye. Was hard to put on and undo. Dainty
2.0,"sadly, the size was too large for me and the color was even more vibrant yellow than pictured.  so I had to return the item, even though I like the design"
2.0,It is supposed to be an extra large when in fact it is smaller than many large size.
2.0,It is a nice quality but has too much slack.  It has at least 6 inches of extra length.
2.0,They fit very nice but after one wash the fabric looks terrible.
2.0,"I purchased this bag in Pink based on the pictures of the listing and one other review that posted a picture of it. When I received it, I was extremely dissatisfied with what it looks like in person. The pink bag looks more purple and the straps were a brighter pink. If the bag were the same pink as the straps I would love it because the bag itself is great."
2.0,The white one writing comes off very cheap purse
2.0,I am 5'3 135 pounds and I ordered a medium and it's huge on me! I would definitely size down!
2.0,"They lied. These are not cotton. They look like they are made from polyester. They would fit really well except that the nose wire is a little on the stiff side. They are super hot and not breathable. I'm someone who spends a fourth of the year wearing a mask because I have severe allergies with respiratory issues. That means that I'm really used to breathing with a mark and I  no longer notice that I'm even wearing one. I also know how to properly wear a mask.  So believe me when I say that these are not good for breathing through long term. They also get really hot. They would be ok if you just wear them to go get groceries, but you wouldn't be able to tolerate them long term. If they were actually made with cotton they would be pretty good, but I wouldn't bother with them. At least there are free returns."
2.0,Arrived as described. Colors look more drab in person. Wish the pattern was more crisp and the colors popped more.
2.0,Bought this item for my son for Christmas. Opened it today he suctioned it to the door and pulled it off and it broke. the red stayed on the glass while he had the handle in his hand. And of course its passed the return time. so fair warning!
2.0,its very flimsy plastic and very small. I wasn't expecting amazing jewlry because it was so inexpensive its cute but I know it wont last very long
2.0,"Overall nice looking wallet, but the zipper broke within a month of use.  Very disappointing!"
2.0,Watches fall off easy
2.0,Color and concept were nice...but the top of the shaft of the boot cut into my shin and calf terribly!  So badly that I had to return.
2.0,These were cheap looking and some broke the first time I put them in. They look cheap too. Don’t waste your money.
2.0,Love the front.. don't like that you can see what would normally be on a tag...right thru it.
2.0,"This looks and feels like polyester or other synethic material.  The description says cotton which leads one to think ""mostly"" cotton.  If there is cotton in it, it must be a low percentage.  I was looking for a cotton mask and am disappointed."
2.0,"I loved the fit of the top part of the dress.  The bottom just seemed uncomfortable and to &#34;starched.&#34; It felt like the material straight off of the roll at the craft store.  The top part of the dress has a great fit.  I was disappointed the bottom didn't seem to be the flowy, thinner material I thought it would be."
2.0,Half of these are wack. They aren't stainless steel since they still have nickel and turned my stomach green!! Not happy!!
2.0,"For the price not bad I guess, but the beads are all have a really really synthetic plastic look. The picture shows it as each bead being various shades but in reality they're all the exact same."
2.0,"Looks like an used product. The straps are stretched out, not adjustable and too many loose threads hanging everywhere. The dress is very see through. Hangs loosely and has no support."
2.0,The seams are rough and not trimmed leaving strings hanging all over. And the butt just fits funny. Would not buy another
2.0,They fall off of the hard pads that are built into my glasses. They need to have some adhesive built in to the pas. Only lasted about a weeik!
2.0,Información really like it but it broke real easy. It was held with fish string type of cord that when stretched it broke. Real sad about it. Now I have to find me another wrist key holder.
2.0,I had to return this.  The fit was really strange it kind of just hung on me and the waist was really high not where it belonged at all.
2.0,Why isn’t it magnetic? This is a cool bag but it’s being sent back. The bag has no magnetic force for the clasp so it’d be terrible if your stuff were to fall out. Also this arrived with stains on it. I’m a big fan of nasa things so its cool in that aspect.
2.0,it already broke within the first 2 days i had it):
2.0,"Would not have purchased had I known upfront that the item is only pleather. Also the item does run large. I'm a slender, athletic build and I normally wear large but, in this case a medium would have been perfect."
2.0,"I was disappointed to find that this coverall suit is sized very small. The construction of the suit is very good, stitching is even and the zipper was attached well. I do believe the sizing is not based on overall size, but purely on height. I would say the 3xl fits more like a medium/large, but certainly not for anyone over 5'7"", and at a very low body weight index. For those of us with a little more around the middle, we will be better off with a different brand with better sizing for a proper fit. I hope this was Helpful, and you will be kind and click the button below."
2.0,"My daughter only wear this one time and it’s already looking like this. other than that, it’s thick nice pants, i just expect better for the price."
2.0,I don't like it. The material is different from what I thought it was going to be
2.0,"This actually had potential, the colors are pretty and the basic design idea was good and then the fabric and construction failed.<br />It's not just a size too small, it's sizes too small and the fabric is cheap with no stretch at all.  I can't completely describe it because it didn't even come close to fitting and, had I of forced it on, I'd either of had to call for the jaws of life to have it removed or live in it forever.<br />I do hope that they go back to the drawing board though because I can see the vision behind the design."
2.0,"I am 5’5”, 170lbs, 36C. I ordered a large. The length was perfect, but the fit was so awkward. It’s not that it was too big/small, but just had drooping and random gathering areas. No matter how tight I pulled in the dress or arranged it, the top drooped open, even if I pinned it, there would be too much material. I am an average C cup, so shouldn’t be so big. Then on the side before the hole where the tie goes, there was just a flap of extra material. No matter how tight or loose I tied the dress, there was extra material that stuck out. Maybe I received a defective one? No pinning or tying was gonna make this work.<br /><br />It’s also very thin and transparent. I was wearing very light grey undies in my photo and they look black. Even if you wore nude, you’d probably still be able to see them."
2.0,"pants suit set too large and frumpy looking. Nothin like the streamlined model photo.  I would have to have it completely altered in order to wear it.  color is fine, just as shown on my monitor.  However,  i want to return.  UPS told me it would be over $200.... yikes.  I have contacted the seller.  Will update when I hear back."
2.0,"I was not expecting this material at all - it's like a super stretchy, very thin sweater-ish material. It's really, really wide, and hangs kind of weird, but I think I might be able to make it work. I'm not as thrilled as I was hoping I might be. I think I've learned my lesson to not shop Amazon for cheap clothes."
2.0,Can’t wear bra. Fit
2.0,"These just fitted strangely, it's as though the two feet were made in two different places using two different patterns. They were returned."
2.0,pants fit weird and were HUGE when the shirt fit normal
2.0,Zipper is bad.
2.0,&#34;POLARIZED&#34; is permanently etched into the right lens and it is VERY noticeable. The photos seem to have been taken to minimize how obvious it is. It's so glaring that I thought it was a removable sticker.
2.0,accidently washed in warm and the thread shrunk but not the fabric leaving a bunched up mess.
2.0,The dress looks nothing like the picture and if you want to return they will offer $5 or tell you that you have to pay for shipping to China.
2.0,The dress itself is fine. It does smell like a smokers home and arrived inside out with deodorant stains/white long animal hair all over it.
2.0,this dress did not work for me and was too small in the chest and fit awkwardly.  i may reorder a bigger size.  material is stretchy but helps hold you in as well
2.0,Way to small! I’m a 40 c and ordered a large like I usually do but for a large it seemed like a extra small couldn’t get my hands through. Quality of good but size up at least 2 sizes bigger ... maybe
2.0,Poorly made front zipper. Something you would expect in the eighteen hundreds. Some thing like 1851
2.0,Dislike the clingy material
2.0,I will post photos later on. The material is very thin and cheaply made. The dress is short and not long. It’s more of a mini dress. Nothing like the picture.
2.0,The cookies are great but I only had 1 whole cookie inside my box. Everything else was pieces and crumbs. Very disappointed
2.0,This didnt meet my expectations.. Im gonna return only because I didnt like the fit or material.
2.0,"Not all that attractive, would not purchase again, bland color, stripes washed out."
2.0,"The shorter chain for the blue tail is very tight, it was uncomfortable to wear"
2.0,"I'm 5'4"", 128 lbs and I ordered Small.<br />1.  This is not cotton or linen.  It's some type of synthetic material that's made to look like linen.  It's scratchy and rather see-through (thankfully I ordered dark grey).<br />2.  Cut is very strange.  I ordered small because I don't have big bosom but while the length and overall appearance are generous, the torso part fits my chest circumference, then it seems to be looser again on the shoulders and neck area, making it look too casual.<br />3.  Overall, I look like wearing oversized pillow case with holes cut for the head and arms.  My husband who knows nothing about fashion and usually doesn't comment on my choice of clothing said I needed some sort of belt (honestly, I haven't had or worn a dress since 2009).  The boat neck (?) and the length also makes the dress slides around my body with only my neck holding it, and the color I chose, grey, really accentuates the dowdiness.  When I looked in the mirror, it reminded me of a picture from the great depression era.  I only need to put a tea towel over my head and I step back 100 years in time."
2.0,All the rings were beautiful!!! Sadly the heart ones I was looking forward to wearing the most are crooked therefore they cannot be worn. ☹️ But other than that the set is beautiful.
2.0,Very cute but sizes Run small  and thin material
2.0,"While this product was in great shape and got to me earlier than expected, avoid at all costs. The seller is misleading about the sizes.  A medium which was supposed to fit a regular sized adult was fitted to fit my three year old niece. I have been trying to return this item for weeks. The seller has not responded."
2.0,These looked so nice in the description. Very disappointed upon receiving them. Strung too tightly with a rhinestone missing. They looked cheap and used.
2.0,Ordered a 2x but fits like a Large.  Way too small.
2.0,Looked good but they got a huge run (like pantyhose) in one wearing. Now I can't wear them.
2.0,"Smells like it was made in a sweat shop next to a pile of old incense and burnt crayons. The faux fur is just that, but scratchy rough. Hood is huge. Not at all what I expected."
2.0,I ordered the black ones. They seem comfortable but the color was faded - one wash and they will be grey I am convinced. Also a little too big in the crotch area.
2.0,Like the case but it blocks the speaker so not a problem if you use it with blue tooth but I use speaker on my phone and makes it hard to here people
2.0,"Quality was good, printing was fine, it just runs a bit on the small side."
2.0,"It was definitely made for smaller, thinner people"
2.0,"Look and fit are great. The fabric, however, is of poor quality. There was lots of piling after just a couple days of wear."
2.0,Very comfy but they retain odor in my opinion. Had to wash multiple times and still didn't fix it. I'm used to cotton underwear that doesn't have that issue.  I also use scent free detergent and dryer sheets so wasn't able to mask it. I won't order again.
2.0,"So sad!  Loved the design!  I thought it would be perfect as a travel bag.  And it would have been if it had not been so poorly made.  The bag is stitched with a large stitch and poor tension.  Inside pocket is stitched but seams are not finished in any way and already fraying.  I realize I should not have expected much for $20, but loved the look and still do."
2.0,My kid really liked the idea..... Would have been 5 stars but we were sent two different size gloves. The smaller one fit nicely but the other one was ridiculously larger and can easily see the difference between the two.
2.0,"Yet pretty, is NOT worth the price!!!!!<br />&#34;HEART Closure&#34;...SPINS...in circles...does NOT stay LOCKED  in place!!!!!..<br />Bcuz of the &#34;SPINNING HEART CLOSURE&#34; it keeps BANGING on things n u CANT really see it bcuz it keeps SPINNING in CIRCLES!!!!!..."
2.0,"One important positive is that this item was packaged and mailed very quickly during a holiday period. Much appreciated! The scarf is disappointing. The material looks and feels 'cheap' and the designs/logos are not crisp or sharp. It is fleece, but it is not a good quality."
2.0,These bracelets were way too large for my wrist.  (They had 8 stones on each bracelet) I actually returned them.
2.0,"Top is huge in the boob area, like huge. The belly part is a slim fit tankini style. Bottoms were smaller than what they should be. Nothing seemed proportionate but for the price I'll try to make adjustments"
2.0,Not as pictured. Coloring very different.
2.0,The neck and arm holes are small in size and my poor son suffered whenever I tried to put it on or take it off. We were only able to use it 2 times.
2.0,This would only work for an adult if you have a really small head.  Gave them to a neighbor’ kid.  Not worth the trouble to return.  He loved them!
2.0,"Let me say Ive purchased a lot from this brand. There stuff was always really good but now ive received two items in a row that were not very good quality, seams are crooked and the weave seems to be off or skewed with snags. Im not sure what happened but im sad to see that this company is letting its quality slip. Im not going to return it as the cost is very low so i will try and repair it and make it work."
2.0,"Pretty, but if you are over 5'4&#34; the length will not fit you"
2.0,Did not fit right.  Did not stay on.
2.0,Does fine but the material is cheap.  I exchanged the first one because it had a hole in the sleeve where the threading had come undone.  The second one doesn't have a hole yet but threading is coming undone. It works if you only need to wear it a few times.
2.0,"Ordered a woman’s 8-10 as I’m a woman’s 4 (normal sized college student), but when I got them they were still way too small. When I could finally get them on I could barely move and the bottom on the leggings that should be at your ankles were right below my knee cap."
2.0,Washed terrible.  The bottom band seem to get all twisted up in a washer.  This is an item that should wash well because it will get washed often.
2.0,"These came in and I was so excited and I couldn't wait to put one in, and I was really looking forward to the orange pill one especially, but now I'm more than aggravated because there are no warnings that you may get 20 of THE SAME COLOR. Don't buy these. They aren't advertised right and its a ripoff."
2.0,Armpit ripped its dumb cheap lol.. mind u this reveiw is prob 2 years after buying it or longer other then that its ok but still really cheap
2.0,I like the top but the bottoms are see thru. Would be even worse in water! Order this for the top.
2.0,Very poor quality. The material is thin and has a hole at the seam where the sleeve connects to the sweater. I would not reccomend buying from this company.
2.0,I am honestly disappointed in this purchase.  The bag looks cheap and flimsy. I wish I had spent more for a quality bag or gone to Nordstrom Rack or TJMaxx for something better. Maybe other colors will look less cheap. It is overly shiny and I worry that my computer is not secure in this back because the straps may break.<br /><br />Genuine leather bags look good a little scuffed up. I am scared to death of this bag getting scratched bc that  one streak won't be &#34;shiny&#34;. Ew why is it so shiny?
2.0,The red patches at elbows are coming up?! So disappointed
2.0,"I thought this was cotton. The material is more of a jersey material but it fits well it comes to the mid thigh area, however i wish it was a little longer but it's still nice."
2.0,"These are cute jeans that fit just right! The only downside is that they're (obviously) really cheap. Mine became worn down and unwearable within the first MONTH of wearing them, which for me seems a little extreme even for fast fashion. I'm really disappointed because while they lasted they were my new favorite!"
2.0,Pros-The cut is smooth and the earrings are light weight.<br />Cons-The image is blurry and VERY faded. Unless someone is 6 inches from my head they won't know what it is.
2.0,"First off, these are GREAT for thick hair. However, the pain I get on my temples after a full 12hr shift is just not worth it. The full brim of the cap isn’t sewn in one pieces. The back end of the cap’s brim is elastic while the front is without. That being said, the sides (at the temples like where the logo is shown) are sewn a bit thicker where the elastic ends. At first it feels incredible — not too tight, not too loose, and my hair fits perfectly. However, after a few hours you get that pressure buildup on the temples. Unfortunately, I couldn’t stand wearing this after a couple weeks. I tried wearing it again a few months later, but same let down."
2.0,"This necklace is much nicer than I had originally anticipated!! I'm always a little hesitant with buying pearls online because they usually tend to look cheap, but this necklace is actually very pretty and doesn't look cheap at all. The pearls are an off-white cream color and are graduated in size from the ends to the center. When stretched out, the pearl section of the necklace measures about 18&#34; long, and there is a 3.5&#34; silver chain at one end so that you can adjust the length. It has a lobster claw clamp, and the pearl stands are strung on what appears to be fairly heavy-duty wire. I love the &#34;twisted&#34; design of the pearl strands - it has a very classy and elegant look. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this necklace to others.<br /><br />*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes. I have no affiliate with the seller or manufacturing company, and I did not receive any compensation for testing or reviewing the product. All opinions are my own and were not influenced by the seller in any way.<br /><br />**UPDATE - 9/23/16**<br />The first time I wore this necklace, I only had it on for about 4-5hrs total and was very careful with putting it on and taking it off. However, the second time I put it on (again, carefully), I got in my car to leave for school and as I was pulling out of my driveway, I started to hear a noise that sounded like little beads hitting the sides of my car door and floor. I looked down and realized that one of the necklace strands had broken and the pearls were falling ALL over my car. I tried cleaning up all the pearls that had scattered all over my car, but I'm still finding little pearls here and there randomly. I'm so disappointed because I really liked this necklace!!!! I can technically still wear it with only 2 strands of the pearls, but now I'm paranoid that the other strands are also going to break and make a mess (and potentially be fall risk if the pearls go all over the floor).  :("
2.0,"These belts do not lay flat at the buckle, so I had to return.  Out of the bag, they looked cute though."
2.0,I tried them on and my head was to small. I gave them to a coworker and they fit her.
2.0,Love the necklace but I wish the violet was violet!! It’s more gray!
2.0,"The hat material is cheap, flimsy, and feels like something you would expect to buy from a Halloween store. I give it 2 stars because I personally bought it for a music festival and I didn't have the intention that it would be a hat that would last long,..though I had really hoped. Oh yeah! The packaging was pretty bad. It came in a bag. A bag. Did I mention that it came in a bag! Which resulted in a very very wrinkled up hat. :("
2.0,Didn’t fit to size and shape.
2.0,Exageradamente grande y la tela no es bonita
2.0,"I ordered XXL when I am normally an XL. Was sent an XL which is too tight in the hips and too small in the breast areas. When went back to order the XXL, it was no longer there. This has had to me two other times when ordering XXL! If you don't have XXLs then say you don't have it"
2.0,My daughter loved it but one of the metal piece fell off
2.0,"I was very disappointed when I received this strap. The strap itself is very, VERY thin. It is definitely not oiled gray, it is a very light and plain gray, not at all like the one the picture shows. The metal is also of very low quality and cheap feeling."
2.0,Great top just a little too short for me. For reference I am 5’3”.
2.0,It broke first time I wore it. Loved the design. Disappointed with the quality of product. Sorry i t broke.
2.0,"Dress is completely see through including the top, which is not shown in pictures. Slit is very high up thigh. I’m larger breasted and this dress is IMPOSSIBLE to wear because doesn’t cover anything."
2.0,"Just didn't like it on me.,"
2.0,Boo got this gor my daughter graduation gift. Broke a month later.
2.0,"Low quality material, assymetric stitching, delivered to me with two holes. With that said, it was cheap and worked alright as a one time wear."
2.0,Received a dress with the same material but it had these huge black buttons down the front.  Didn't see that in the picture. Runs small. Sent it back
2.0,"It's really big, quality is good, but it's way too big."
2.0,I have always been told I have a big head and they swallow my head!!
2.0,I was hoping for a vacation dress. Never got to wear it and returning it. The fit was obnoxiously tight and short. I always wear a small...5’6” 130 lbs. The material was so see through! Not even able to be a night dress.
2.0,"nice design, poor quality... NO POCKETS (well, not much)<br /><br />The top (standard) pockets have almost no depth...  so be prepared to lose your keys, your cell phone and anything else you need, because the mfgr was too cheap to make a pocket worth having."
2.0,The arms fell off the glasses
2.0,"The purse is beautiful, color, texture, etc., but the opening is compromised by the zipper.  Who designed this thing?"
2.0,Not very &#34;slim&#34; it's actually short on my waist and not slim at all.
2.0,"Really disappointed about the color of the bag.  Otherwise, nice bag."
2.0,Love this outfit but it doesnt wash well...after 1 wash it balles up with lint balls
2.0,"After 2 days of daughter wearing necklace, clasp on chain broke."
2.0,Very tight in the chest and sleeves. Normally a 3XL is a bit baggy on me. This shirt definitely runs small.
2.0,They dont look like the picture..yes they r like weight but its crate papper..
2.0,The shirt is smaller than normal for the size we ordered.it didn't fit.
2.0,"Item arrived on-time. Tried it on and it looked good. I got size Small (5'6&#34; and 120 lbs). I could've got a smaller size but they didn't have smaller size than a Small. It's still good though, I don't really like it to be too tight since this is for work. The material is very stretchy, which I like.<br /><br />***Update: I washed it with cold water and gentle cycle, then, I hung dry. It came out super wrinkled and need to be ironed really badly. However, I don't buy clothes that need to be ironed. That's why I don't even own an iron. It also shrank a little. If I knew that this needs to be ironed, I would've chosen a different dress. I'm not impressed."
2.0,"Wore to prom. Little, lets say ring leaderish, if thst is a word. Circus. Perfect"
2.0,"My favorite attire to wear when participating in my two favorite sports (running and pickleball): skirted leggings! I like all types of tights, the short (""skort""), capri (like these) or full length, which is why I chose these. I set this pair out flat before trying them on and noticed something odd--the tights are almost uniformly wide throughout their length rather than tapering from wide at the top for the thigh and becoming narrower at the calf. I pulled them on and realized that this was the skirted leggings' biggest problem. The skirt part fits me just right (5'4""x120#), but the leggings are comparatively gigantic. If you've ever worn skirted leggings, you know that the top part needs to fit right and the tights need to actually be tight. The biggest surprise to me is that in the product information, the model looks to be about my size and a proportional person (as opposed to someone with an average sized hip area and gigantic legs, which I've never seen in real life), yet the tights fit her perfectly. There is no way I would be caught in public in this disproportioned tights. Although the color scheme is nice (and is the only thing I like about them), the material is really thin so I can see the drawstring through the turquoise waistband and I can actually feel the prominent seams along my legs. These skirted leggings (which look like a knockoff of the Anivivo brand) are disproportional with material that is too thin."
2.0,Chain broke within one week.
2.0,"too large,, and too see thru"
2.0,"very, very small!  Too small to wear!"
2.0,Love the colors and band except that the band will sometimes pop off
2.0,"Agree with a previous post about the ball that goes on the inside being rough. There was a very small, sharp plastic piece attached to the end of the ball. The product otherwise was advertised. The part where the post connects to the flat head is clear.... until you put it in. Then it takes up the shadow from within your nose and it looks like you have a blackhead. I would not buy this again as I did not like the way it looked."
2.0,I guess this is something you wear once.  It’s very thin and looks cheap
2.0,Hoped to have more blue tones appears more of a quartz than moonstone
2.0,"Bottoms fit a little smaller than sized, and top is significantly loose. Doable, but I’m a good D and I had extra room. However, the suit is cheaply made. Seams on the top straps have already separated, so<br />I can’t wear it until I can get it resewn. Not sure if I’ll spend the time or effort, though."
2.0,"Like - the look of them on<br />Dislike - the low ankle pattern is not flexible, so getting over the heel can be tricky.<br />They are lower waisted than other pants, so I’m constantly pulling them up.<br />The material is not breathable and is much thicker and warmer than other pants. Not what you want for outdoor excercise."
2.0,"The pattern of this product is pretty, but the fabric wasn’t what I expected. I was surprised by how uncomfortable it felt."
2.0,"They are so comfortable, but if you have any cellulite or not smooth legs, pass these by. I thought these for the gym but I dont think I'd ever be able to wear them out of the house"
2.0,It’s not nearly as flattering at the pictures. It was kinda shapeless and cheap looking.  I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re shorter cause it’s just unattractive and looked more like a shroud.
2.0,Poor quality and one of the small captive rings came off the first day.
2.0,went to race and was windy and was torn by the end of the race/
2.0,"Very pretty set and that is the only reason for an extra star. I ordered a medium and I am 5'4"" and 127 lbs. This barely covered my nips. The top is so small that it looks like it would fit a child. The bottoms were tiny and I could barely pull the pants over my hips and I have small hips. I gave it to my 100lb. 13 yr. old niece and it fit. Waste of money!!!"
2.0,They were itchy
2.0,"I was excited for this necklace and unfortunately didn't pay attention to the reviews before purchasing (which I'm usually pretty particular about). While his necklace does look as pictured...IT IS SMALL. Not sure what stature the person is modeling this necklace but where the knot is on the model is where the necklace ENDED on me. Granted, I have a larger chest but even if I didn't, this necklace would NOT make it to my waist. I gave it to my 3yo for her dress up clothes and it fits her just as pictured."
2.0,Doesn’t look or feel like real leather. Disappointed.
2.0,"This ended up being SO small I thought there wasn't even anything in the bag. I have liked other product purchased by Kinzie, but I do not see how this would even fit in anyone nostril piercing, let alone stay put. It looked to be smaller than any piercing gauged needle that would commonly be used (18-20 or 22 gauge being the thinnest) - almost as thin as a piece of sewing thread. The stud itself was just barely larger - probably less than 0.5mm, which is TINY. I hate to post something so negative, but it does not look anything like the picture - only if you were to magnify it greatly. For the price, it is just not worth it. If it were larger, I'm sure it would be a beautiful piece!"
2.0,"I'm usually size M in US sizes, I bought size XL for this shirt, but it's still small for me."
2.0,"It’s just kinda cheap, not what I expected"
2.0,my daughter loves this dress but the straps are placed really far into the armpit
2.0,Didn’t like the way it hugged the center of my butt it made it look like I had a wedge gee and didn’t like the ruffle material on the butt part of you have curves and big butt need bigger sizes  value for money will look good on smaller women
2.0,"They stink so bad, make sure you wash them before using"
2.0,"I bought this for girls weekend, so wasn't needing anything perfect, but the quality is very far from perfect.  Will need to shape and iron it in the hopes it will even look remotely close to a captain's hat.  Was very smushed up and bent in packaging.  But I suppose you get what you pay for."
2.0,I gave it two stars because it ruined my white jacket and car seats. The pink rubbed off on everything even after washing. They fit great & the color is beautiful.
2.0,On the 2nd wearing the glove lost its heat. A very cold experience. On the positive side the company gave mea refund or offered a replacement. They were very nice.
2.0,"Actual bracelet is not marked 925, clasp chain is. I'm not sure bracelet is actually silver as it turns with wrist green with short term wear. Bracelet is made for a very small wrist as it barely fit wrist. Product is very pretty but I would say it is a fine quality costume jewelry. Please don't embarrass yourself and try to pass this off to a friend as a real silver gift."
2.0,Bought a two pack.  Only one hat in the box. Will have to return as I needed the two hats that where advertised.
2.0,"I just recieved it, but it is not the same as the picture. It is not the sane quality as the Soufeel brand. Dissapointed"
2.0,Likeable but cheap materials. Doesn't lay flat like the photo.
2.0,"Pros: it’s soft and warm. It’s lined and heavier than expected.<br /><br />Cons: it’s boxy and unflattering. The zipper is a very bright silver and stuck out too much. The elastic part around the neck is really thin (not like pictured) and the proportion is off. I got the olive green, and it was just ugly. Not a pretty green.<br /><br />I’m returning it."
2.0,"Broke within a month, but plus size friendly"
2.0,"I do not have a large posterior. rather flat actually.  With the Shereskin, the waistband was not too tight,  and leg length was good; but the back could not be pulled up to the waist to be even with the front....in other words, not enough &#34;butt&#34; room.  I have never experienced this before. I wore Hanes for years, but tried these, as the Hanes wore out in just under a year.  Oh well, dumping these on Good Will and ordering more Hanes...&#34;the devil you know&#34;, so to speak"
2.0,"pilling at heel and toe area, so much of it that I don't think these socks will last long if you are an avid walker, consider it only has 40% wool, the pilling I get after each wear is waaaay too much!!!"
2.0,The 3 rings combined makes it a smaller size than you would normally wear. I suggest ordering up a size.
2.0,They don’t advertise that it’s scrunch but in the  title- also the photos you can’t really tell that it’s scrunch but… but when you read through the actual description you’ll see them mention it scrunch but. The scrunch butt is not made right it doesn’t feel good on so returning this it. It’s really nice material though. I wish it was not scrunch butt and I would’ve kept it.
2.0,The description said it ran small but this thing is like a tent. Not cute.
2.0,They worked great when they worked.  Half of them came not working.
2.0,"Fit well, but the design was different than the picture."
2.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS! It doesn't look anything like the picture. Just another ordinary square-shape torso with a deep round neckline, I'm US size 14 and it's too large on me."
2.0,"Was hopeful this band would be a fine replacement for my old, worn out leather watchband.  Managed to get the band attached without much problem.  However, the first time I wore the mesh bracelet watch band the clasp wouldn't stay closed.  It popped open repeatedly.  I can't wear my watch because of this problem and must purchase a new replacement - guess I'll go back to wearing a leather watchband."
2.0,"I loved this right out of the package. It was long, comfy, and flowy. The very first time I washed it, it shrank at least six inches!!! I didn't even dry it! It barely covers my rear end now, and the sleeves don't reach my wrists. I'm pretty short, only 5' 1"", so this should definitely be longer in me than it is. On a taller woman, it would practically be a crop top. So disappointed!!!"
2.0,The thing is very pretty - but the ring broke off within 2 months.
2.0,"VERY thin material, not warm at all"
2.0,"Very off colors. The Charlie pin made her look like a burn victim and the Alastor pin was too dark in color. Only kept the Vaggie, Angel, and Husk pins. The Vaggie pin looks best in my opinion, but still not accurate with the colors in the show. Be prepared to be a little disappointed if you order these pins."
2.0,"I had expectations this 32D bra would be a dream for me like it has for most everybody else. I'm giving it two stars, one for each of the two days I wore it - actually day and a half that I wore it before it started falling apart! When I first put it on it felt ok. The padding on the bottom of the cups seemed like it took up too much space until the foam adjusted. About 10 hours later the foam must have expanded because the top of my breast was popping out a bit. The following day I adjusted the straps to see if the pop out the top would go away...<br />It did a bit, but halfway through my day something got really uncomfortable, scratchy, irritating! After a dog walk I was so uncomfortable I changed - and found the bra had started falling apart. The lace and some other structural element between the cups was dissolving, falling apart! No wonder it was making me crazy. I've never had a bra die like this one did on the first wearing. R.I.P. Ekouaer. Funny thing is I didn't know it was a 'plus size' until it arrived. I'm slender - perhaps that has something to do with the fit and explain why this bra self-destructed."
2.0,Don't like at all. I wear medium and these were too small.
2.0,Not a good fit. No zipper
2.0,"I returned the dress right after I received it. The quality and material was substandard, looks and feels cheap..."
2.0,These hats came rolled up and we cannot flatten them out. They were very cheaply made. They are going back.
2.0,I should have bought the gold or silver. This arbon version looks cheaply made.
2.0,A sweater jacket as described should be sweater material not t-shirt material. I ordered the XXL as I wanted it to fit over another shirt {like a jacket} without any issues but the size was as if I was going to wear it alone. It is not a jacket as described. Very disappointed in the description vs what was actually received. I will not be ordering from these folks again.
2.0,"Half the buttons fell off the first time I washed it. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Disappointing because I've purchased other PattyBoutik shirts that are great. They fit well for tall, slender body types. Usually sleeves are too short but this brand always fits."
2.0,"This gown is nice but the material is just too thin. You can only wear it when you are alone or with your bf/hubby and also if you have a perfect body. Otherwise, everything is going to show, every little lining or crease."
2.0,"I love the look of this outfit, i thought i ordered a size 140 instead got size 110 which was really tiny, my 5 year old wears a size 10 girls clothing, technically it fit her but very very snug and skimpy, this was more of a 3 maybe small 4 yr old size, if it had been the right size i wouldn't have returned it honestly, i also like how the skirt had built in shorts."
2.0,"Definitely order down a size or two. I'm 5'4&#34; and this was almost night gown length on me. The back also has lace which I didn't notice. It is very soft which I liked, but overall it looked way too much like a night gown for my taste. It wasn't very fitted either like in the picture."
2.0,Too small I need to return them. I ordered medium size
2.0,Was only sent 7 rocks in an unsealed plastic bag tossed into a box. Not what I was expecting but too much trouble to return. Annoyed that I received only 7 instead of 12. The rock size and shape is otherwise nice. Such a shame.
2.0,I normally wear a size 12 or a medium in pants but I read that these pants ran very small so I ordered a size extra large--and they were still 'way too small!  Even an xxl would be too small for me.  I'd have to go for a size xxxl if they even make them that size!  They are a nice-looking pair of pants and they seem well made but the sizing is just too far off.  I'll look elsewhere for light-colored pants.
2.0,"Beautiful watch, but unfortunately it gets condensation in it when it's humid here making it a little difficult to read the time."
2.0,"I put this on originally and found that it was comfy sure, but a bit tight. Next i found the pockets that came with it were absolutely tiny, not even large enough to hold my phone, and they were awkwardly placed much further down than expected. A few things were out of place too."
2.0,"The end that snapped on to the Fitbit piece did not connect well and frequently disconnected causing the Fitbit to fall off my wrist. In the end, it fell off while I was doing yardwork and I didn't notice. I found it later in the day, but only after a rainstorm and my Fitbit was ruined.<br />The positive things I will say is that the finish was very pretty and the magnetic closure was strong and stayed where I put it."
2.0,sizing was not right. i wear a med. ordered a xl. too small. china sizing
2.0,"This &#34;leather&#34; card wallet feels thin & cheap. I don't expect this to last more than 6 months. I don't think this wallet should be more than $5. Of course, for the price, this isn't going to be a quality wallet, like a Fossil."
2.0,"These are more for fashion. I brought them to actually hold on to my glasses and that failed. They're nice for the look, well put together, and while your glasses are on your face. But by any chance your glasses should shift any a little, they might fall off of the holder."
2.0,"Cheap fabric, see through, it is like a tunic with no shape, it’s ok, but nos exactly as picture and will not be able to use it for the occasions that I was expecting, maybe for something more relaxed, not very dressy..."
2.0,"It fit well but I knew if I ate, wanted to dance or sit in it, I wouldn’t last. So sadly returned. Nice fabric, very boutique style!"
2.0,Sweater looked nice but fit was way to small in large and I always wear a medium. But comments by other buyers said order size up. . I did and still to small.
2.0,"I do love it. It’s nice material and is cute on. I have only one issue with it, but it’s a biggie. I followed the sizing chart and read reviews, and still it doesn’t fit right. Had I gone one more size up though, it’d have been too loose in the bust. Hopefully I lose more weight and it fits better before summer is over."
2.0,"I ordered this bag to use for travel documents for an upcoming trip. I have opened and closed it approximately 4 times since I received it, and today when I opened it to load up our documents, the velcro fastener on the flap began coming off. We leave for the trip in a week, and I do not have time to wait for a replacement. Very disappointed in the quality of the product."
2.0,Tarnished within a week. Too bad bc it's perfect length.
2.0,Ordered a large  but looks like a small.  Not happy
2.0,"Although these earrings look small, they are pretty large.  Also, they broke the first time I was putting them on, so I never got to use them.  I was going to give them as a gift and decided not to.  I am glad I did."
2.0,Not a fan of these. I’m 5’9 and these go past my knee which is not comfortable. Tried rolling it down- made it worse.
2.0,I'd didn't look the way it displayed on the web and color was different
2.0,"They did not look as nice as the picture, Very cloudy and cheap looking."
2.0,But it’s too small!
2.0,I bought this for myself and I have a small wrist it fits but it looks more like a child's bracelet than adult. The balls on the end are extrememly small also. I gave it to my niece who is 12
2.0,Pictures reflect a rose tone on the watch but it is more gold than rose.
2.0,"I really like the style--enough to have wanted it for a while in more than one color. But when I finally bought one (blue), and tried it on, the fabric was a very scratchy acrylic that bothered my skin immediately. It felt terrible on, and it's too fitted to want to layer it with a long sleeve shirt beneath. Guess I should never violate my ""No Acrylic"" policy, because I will always regret it. I wish this design were offered in a different fabric blend. If you don't mind wearing abrasive fabrics, enjoy it. It's cute."
2.0,Not as pretty as it looks on line and very cheap quality
2.0,"I returned these sandals as they were damaged when I received them.  They are super-cute, but the little scales in the pattern were coming loose around the straps, revealing the leather underneath.  I was concerned that this defect would cover the straps if worn for any length of time.  They seem to run narrow as well."
2.0,Sizing is much smaller than listed... Ordered one size and it feels as if the ring is a whole size smaller.
2.0,Runs small and very low cut looks cheap
2.0,"very cheaply made, fell apart quickly."
2.0,"I loved the concept of this dress but am not sure I like the final product. I usually appreciate anything denim, so selecting this cute little number was a no brainer. Unfortunately, my expectations did not meet reality. And I will admit, it could be my body shape or my insecurities, regardless, I am not very fond of it.<br /><br />The Apbondy denim dress is nice, but there are some issues at least in my opinion. The dress itself is a little short (stops mid-thigh), so wearing it as a dress (at my age – I’m middle aged) is definitely out of the question. I would have to wear it with leggings.  The sleeves are long and wide, but there is an option to button it (making it shorter). However, when the sleeves are loose, they look weird. There is a v shape to the opening (nehru collar), and it buttons down the front, which is accented by pockets (on the breasts). There is also a large ruffle towards the bottom (hem).  The fabric is dark blue and thin. It is oversized, so there is no need to order up.  This also explains why I didn’t like the fit. It runs super big. And even when I tried to jazz it up, with leggings, earrings etc., there was still something a little frumpy about it. It also made me look larger than I am. So, I will be wearing this around the house only. 2 stars is being generous."
2.0,The ones I received were misaligned and didn't sit right on my ears. They were also too large.
2.0,"I bought the larger size, because my 6mo girl is sooo chunky. But when I tried putting them on, the ankle cuffs were right, the thigh cuffs were WAY too small, and the middle sagged down around her ankles and shins! And they left red marks - not the kind that goes away like sock marks do, the kind that stay overnight or longer, bright red. Too big for a newborn, too tight for a crawler, and too baggy for either.<br /><br />I guess the colors are ok?"
2.0,I ordered a size larger to start with and they are still tight.
2.0,Lense got scratched easily.  You can scratch off  the lense with your finger nail
2.0,"Looked great, but fell apart in the first week. Will be requesting a new one, and hope it works."
2.0,"A little too big on my earlobe. I still have it but don’t often wear it because it gets caught to my hair too often. Also, made cheaply"
2.0,Sweat and sticky
2.0,"Cute case, but cracked within a week, not very durable."
2.0,you might want to order 2 times larger as this fits very small
2.0,"I selected the side recommended (m), it was too small, As I pulled it on my fore finger went through the material on the left leg. 😢 once I got it up it still rolled off my upper body towards my waist. It didn't work for me. I needed a large. The material felt nice."
2.0,Very cheap material... my son wore it once and it had a hole in it along the seam...
2.0,This item was poor quality.  I realized at the last minute that there was a hole in it!  It was too late for me to find something else to wear so I had to patch it with some wardrobe tape and go.  Would not buy this item again!
2.0,"well, to start off the hoops we're extremely smaller than anticipated but the rainbow iridescent is very pretty. but with the studs I couldn't get them in for the life of me lol, the l shaped ones are very short and small. but cute bag and a nice gift"
2.0,Runs like 2 sizes too small. I gave it away as a gift instead of fussing with returning it.
2.0,"I am giving this item two stars for it's cute look (I purchased the white one with flowers), compact style, and overall thought. However, this tiny little umbrella sure does hate the wind! It blocks you from the UV rays of the hot sun but it does not befriend the wind. That wind will be gushing and the umbrella suddenly flips out. Don't even think the 8 prongs makes a difference if it can't withstand 1 mph winds. So although the concept of this umbrella is wonderful, the overall functionality of sturdiness is not. Not to say that I will not take this little number to the beach but I hope there are no winds otherwise you will say goodbye to this cute little number."
2.0,"I had another wrap that worked so much better, but unable to find it again.  This wrap doesn't keep me cool for more than a few minutes."
2.0,Its too big.
2.0,"I love my leggings so I'm very particular with how they fit. I was very disappointed. They don't stretch like they should, very thin, run a little small and are not capri length (hey come to the bottom of my knee cap if I pull them down). I'm bummed that I bought 2 pair and the package was already thrown away otherwise I would send them back."
2.0,broke in less than a month
2.0,Adorable but the clicker doesn’t stay in.  Like at all.
2.0,They feel alright I just feel that they're too thin
2.0,Hate the fit got a large so it wouldn’t be super short. It was still pretty short and just didn’t sit right. Boxy and unflattering
2.0,Fabrics separating after little wear
2.0,Runs extremely small. Not as pictured.
2.0,"I like a good float dress that hides my mom belly. However, this shapeless dress somehow clings in all the wrong places. It also runs large and long."
2.0,"It’s not a crock top, it’s a bra ladies."
2.0,Runs very small. Very dissatisfied with the quality.
2.0,"It was very nice when I used it for first two month, but its anti-reflect material start to getting off after wipe. So it only last long two month."
2.0,While I love the dress... It is very short. Definitely not ankle length as shown in the picture and... I'm only 5'5.
2.0,the charms are not finished on both sides so I returned it.
2.0,I didn't like them. They mashed my hair down.  I thought there would be more room with them. I don't wear them. Wasted money. I guess a lesson learned.
2.0,"Looked cute on the picture but definitely doesn’t fit right. Color and appearance seems to match picture. I ordered a larger size and it was entirely too small, the material is the silky stuff that clings to every roll or indent. I attempted to return it thinking I’d try an even larger size and their policy is to refund less than 1/4 of the price you paid or you pay the shipping for it to go back to China."
2.0,The belt buckle separate from the belt within 2 weeks of receipt.
2.0,"Shoes looks nice but they run big. I ordered a 3 and they fit more like a 3.5 or 4. The size was no where to be found on the shoe. I saw a 35 on the bottom...maybe there was a dot in between to make it 3.5 at any rate the shoe was too big. Also the shoes did not come in a box, the wording on the inside some was coming off just a tad and they had newspaper stuffed in the front part of shoe. In my opinion they were previously worn and returned. Disappointing as this shoe got good reviews. Definitely returning asap!"
2.0,I've worn these before and the fit is great but the quality is poor.<br />Not like what I've purchased in the past :(
2.0,"They weren't what I thought they were.You can see through them which I misunderstood. When the stated hollow I was thinking not solid, not see through."
2.0,I don’t particularly care for the “snugness” of this fit.
2.0,The sizing tag said that this shirt was an XL. What it is no larger than a medium. I loved everything about this shirt except the wrong sizing information. I gave it away to a friend with a daughter who wears a medium and am told it fit her daughter perfectly.
2.0,"This was purchased for my boyfriend. They were tiny. Definitely meant for women's arms, as it ran incredibly small, and we couldn't buckle the top two. And his forearms aren't even that large. Actually smaller than most men. Also it only comes in a right arm, so if you buy two, you'll have an imperfect match.<br /><br />For the quality, and the fit, and the whole right arm only thing, I'd just splurge in the future and buy a nicer set honestly."
2.0,Have purchased this shirt not on amazon and grandson loved it. However after washing the neck stretched way out of shape and he’s very upset.
2.0,"Went on a hiking trip and was looking for a lightweight waterproof bag. Needless to say, this was not it.<br /><br />I walked in a light drizzle with this bag and items in the bag quickly became wet. Luckily, the items in the bag weren't extremely valuable, but they were wet nonetheless.<br /><br />It's a cool bag, but not waterproof, which is why I purchased it."
2.0,"Originally thought these were well made, high quality leather, extremely comfortable without looking dowdy. I even bought another pair in a different color!!<br /><br />Now after about 4 months the sole is peeling off completely and is a tripping hazard. 😕<br /><br />Such a disappointment...and a waste of money. The only reason I gave 2 stars and not just 1 is because before they fell apart they were my favorite shoes for everyday use--comfortable and pretty."
2.0,"The short fits well and used to look good. However, the round castelli logo begins peeling off after the first wash. This is not a big deal, but for the price of this short, you can probably get a similarly comfortable short whose logo does not peel."
2.0,"After reading some reviews that it runs small I ordered size L (large), and it’s more like 12-14 it says on the tag. Which usually that means extra large. It doesn’t say S (small), M (medium), or L ( Large) on tags. This can fit me not a child. The size is more like adult small. My daughter is 8 & she’s a gymnast. The Leotards she’s wearing now are size Medium. This is so large it will take years for her to fit in. Now I have deal with returning it. Otherwise the material & color are good."
2.0,"I am 5’4, 170 pounds. I ordered an extra large just to give myself some baggy fit with the sweats. They came very fitted, basically like wearing leggings even with an extra-large. My normal size for leggings is a large so I definitely don’t recommend getting them if your size is a large or extra large unless you want a very tight fit. The material is thin and yes they are still comfortable, but definitely not what I expected when I want to buy some sweats instead of leggings."
2.0,"i purchased a 4x bc reviews suggested ordering a size up. I’m normally a 3x. It fits and the tightness is just right, but it is too short to even tuck into jeans or leggings, so it does roll up. If I had gone up another size, it would’ve been too loose."
2.0,Very flimsy product not worth the money
2.0,"Material is good, but I’m usually a S/M (4-6) and ordered a Medium and it is sooo tight!!<br />I’m going to have to exchange for at LEAST a Lg. I may just order an xl!"
2.0,The watched arrived quickly. After washing my hands water got into the watch and skews the view. It’s advertised as water resistant. Hardly. The clasp is hard to buckle because the holes are to small. And the wrist band is pretty cheap and probably won’t hold up long. It was an inexpensive watch so I guess I shouldn’t have expected much. I won’t be buying another one.
2.0,"Too small.  If you decide to order, be sure to order 3 sizes larger or not at all."
2.0,Sides of the dress where you arms are way too loose
2.0,Two of the screw heads broke during assembly.  I feel like the quality could have been better.
2.0,"Very big and bulky to wear, I returned them."
2.0,"This modest activewear looks okay but not that nice. If someone comes closer to you, people can also realise how cheap this material is. Moreover, it is very uncomfortable the fabric feel. As I bought it to wear at my workplace, this is not something you can wear outside of the house if you have some Sense of fashion. Martial wise, it's not worth it at all."
2.0,"When I first received this chain it was smooth and did not catch my blouse or hair. However, the longer I have it the more burrs it seems to get. Now it catches on my blouses and my hair. This would be the perfect chain if I could figure out how to get rid of the burrs."
2.0,"I really liked this scarf at first - it washed up great, it’s super soft ... & then I wore it. My black pants turned white with fuzz from the scarf and i’m still finding the fuzz on my clothes a week later even after washing everything."
2.0,"One was a little small, the other was ok.  There was a rubbery smell to both, this was not very pleasant. The look on the girls was pretty, they liked that part of the hats. If I had known there was an odor to them, probably would not have bought them."
2.0,"Really pretty items, but a few of them have pointy edges that dig into the sides of my navel. Also, the largest one is quite heavy."
2.0,"Soft and cute....BUT the lines on the booty and the front don't connect! I just can't get over it, will be returning. Too noticeable!"
2.0,"I’m 5’6, 28 waist, 34 hips, pants size 6, legging size small. I ordered my usual size small. One star for the fit- full length, high and wide waistband that were comfy to wear. Another star for the really cute print. But that’s pretty much where it ends. These aren’t black but a dark dark navy blue. The inner lining is a blue gray which shows through with any stretch. There’s zero compression or shaping in the material. And after wearing them for just a few hours they already started to pill up and look like they’ve been through the wash many times. I wouldn’t recommend for gym wear, and I definitely don’t think these are going to last more than a few (casual) wears."
2.0,"Not nearly as nice as I expected, good color was more yellow than gold. I wouldn't buy another one, I wore it once and now it collects dust"
2.0,I don't like quality of this product for the price. I expected more
2.0,Purchased this item as a sweater and ordered a large.  I couldn’t even fit it over my head it was so narrow.  It would better fit an underdeveloped teenager.
2.0,"They are great sunglasses, my son like it but it broke after two months."
2.0,Verrry pretty embroidery but fit was NOT flattering and did nothing for me
2.0,Smells like BO. Scared to wash incase the smell won’t come out and then I cannot return it. Had it on for less than a minute and couldn’t take the smell.
2.0,Way too baggy and material was totally see through
2.0,"Loved these at first, but unfortunately they are falling apart at the seams, literally. I’ve had them for 3 weeks and worn them probably 5-6 times. They fit great. I love the material and they look awesome on. I have another pair in the army green and they have no issues at all. I have a pair in the navy and they are a completely different fit/material than the pink and green pair which is disappointing.<br /><br />If these weren’t coming unraveled at every seam I’d give them 5 stars, but due to the fact that the hip, ankle, and front seam are all unraveling and there’s a gap in the crotch from where the seam has loosened I have to give them a 2."
2.0,"Ordered in green because I specifically needed a green dress for a party, but it came navy blue.  I'm 5'5&#34;, 130lbs. and wear a medium in everything, but this medium was either small or the neckline on the dress is much higher than the picture.  Gave it two stars, because it came much quicker than expected."
2.0,"Too large, looks like it is made for gigants"
2.0,Not good! The first time I used made holes and it doesn't hold up at all. I just give 2 stars because fit well and look like the picture but the material is cheap and not very stretchy
2.0,"The suit fit just as expected and was comfortable. I also like the design. Unfortunately I never got to swim with it as my wife made me immediately send it back because it was too revealing. So, I had to give it only two stars because of that."
2.0,I found the clips on these ultra thin frames intrusive. They caused distractions when driving. The full frame version is far more superior. SKIP THE ULTRA THIN FRAMES
2.0,This product is way to short and the material doesn't stay straight. It keeps rolling up
2.0,It was top small in the waist area
2.0,"I loved the way this dress fit on me. Only problem I had is after my first time wearing it...I washed it , & the zipper flipped inside out. I’m going to have to take it to some alteration place if I want to wear it again."
2.0,Some of the strands already broke off after just a month of wear
2.0,These glasses came messed up. The frame and nosepiece were both bent. Usually I get very good products from locs so I’ll order these again and give it a shot!
2.0,"Not the best quality, and the pinks are different shades of pink. Not to mention the light pink are extremely light. I returned them."
2.0,These looked great out of the bag but they do pill terribly after first couple washes. Spend a little more and get a name brand you trust. Why waste your money.
2.0,"Horrible material, cheap and poor quality."
2.0,Logo is good but Cheap material. Creases on sides of arm like from an iron.
2.0,"I like this boots very much but hate the fact that the stitching on the outside i can feel it on the inside rubbing on my toes which makes it very uncomfortable, i even try wearing it with two pairs of socks  and same result."
2.0,"Does not fit if you're tall. I'm about 5'9&#34; and fairly long waisted, when I snapped the bottom it pulled the neckline down so far that it didn't cover my chest."
2.0,Cute hat but poor quality
2.0,"I loved this bag when I first got it -- but after about 6 months the main zipper broke.  It's a really nice-looking, comfortable, useful  bag -- I thought it was perfect until the zipper broke.  I know I could find someone to repair the zipper -- I tried various ways to fix it, myself -- but I don't want to have to do that.  But then again, for such an inexpensive bag ... you get what you pay for.  I would have gladly paid much more -- three or four times as much -- for a bag of better quality.  Soooo disappointed ...."
2.0,"Was looking for a pair of smooth, seam free, non-irritating, non-bunching, non-clinging travel briefs suitable for sitting on a stuffy 12 hour flight.<br />These were not it."
2.0,They were way too small. They are the size I always get in UGGS. Very dusappointed.
2.0,I was looking forward to receiving these. They are way too small.
2.0,It is very poorly made. I'm afraid it will break at any moment. Not really worth the money I paid for it.
2.0,You get what you pay for. It’s looks cheap. Lol<br />But it will do the job. Not something I would like to recommend or repurchase. The picture is a good lure.  Costume jewelry look!
2.0,"I loved my bracelet, unfortunately the chain broke off from bracelet the first time I wore it. So disappointed :("
2.0,"Lovely socks, but the top cuff doesn't stretch at all. Disappointed I can't wear these."
2.0,"tl;dr: Serious design flaw caused necklace item to separate itself from the necklace string in first 30 minutes out of the house,<br /><br />I absolutely love the design and the mythology behind Ollin. After receiving the material it feels so good. The gunmetal has almost wood-like texture and is beautiful.<br /><br />I've had issues in the past with every single metal chain necklace falling and me loosing the piece. I have had luck with leather / string necklaces so instead of using the metal chain provided that is bound to break, I put in my leather string.<br /><br />It work and felt great wearing around the house,.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my first 30 minutes out of the house I almost lost the necklace as I felt the shield tumble down my shirt.... The shield itself has a somewhat study circle attachment to it,. However, the part that is attached to the shield that is meant for the necklace string / chain has a massive gap just begging for the shield part to fall thru.<br /><br />Fortunately, I think some pliers can close the gap. Hopefully that won't affect changing the necklace string nor cause marks. If the necklace ever disappears due to this design, I will be contacting the manufacture. In fact, I may preemptively contact them expressing concern so that.<br /><br />2 star because the design is so beautiful and unique but it seems designed to be lost A-S-A-P with that gap"
2.0,"Great looking out of the package. Really felt durable and heavy duty, but I put these in my daughter’s softball cleats and after 4 games, the left lace shredded. Disappointed, to say the least."
2.0,"Bought this item 2 sizes bigger than usually needed, and sure enough, it just barely fits. The shirt had to be stretched just to be worn comfortably. I do not recommend this shirt unless you like the super tight fit."
2.0,"As adorable as this is , I bought this for my at the time 2 month old who was a preemie and it was too narrow to wear even one time . I passed it along to my newborn nephew to maybe get a wear or two out of it."
2.0,they serve their purpose but the outer material is coming unraveled.
2.0,I couldn’t have been more excited when I order this product. I love the dark navy color and I wanted something light for the summer that I can wear to work. When it arrived I was so disappointed. THIS IS NOT FOR TALL PEOPLE. I’m 5’11 and The waist is pretty much under my breasts. The material isn’t great (something that is reminiscent of a bedsheet) but with proper cut and length I would be able to wear this to work in the summer (with some accessories). However the cut is just for short and skinny people. Very disappointed
2.0,"Large was to big, Cheap material 👎🏻"
2.0,"I ordered what should have been my size, according to their chart. It was too big- by several inches. I can alter that, that's not problem. But I haven't decided if I want to- the fabric is really sleazy, very thin. And this is really too bad, because the dress I saw in the photo was really cute."
2.0,"It looked very cool, but had some adhesive residue on the body, which was peeled of after a little effort.<br />But then after a week I saw that the beautiful orange interior fabric is torn. :("
2.0,"I was disappointed when I received this watch. First, because there was no box that came with it. Second, it's very lightweight and the band almost felt like plastic. It looks nice though."
2.0,I got one set previously and they were great.  Ordered the Dark Series and they do NOT have the ear loops.  Will be returning
2.0,Will not order again from this company. The top is poorly made and an odd shape.
2.0,"You could barley see the baguette's and they were very dull, which made it even harder to see the any diamonds."
2.0,"My husband has a baseball hat collection and many of the same high quality standards of this one. However, we ordered this hat in the same size as all his other hats and it is noticeably smaller and uncomfortable for him to wear. Disappointing."
2.0,It was awesome until I figured out I was allergic to the material
2.0,Wore it 2 times and already have a small hole forming. Not even sure how. Very comfy just cheaply made. Get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,"I do not believe this is 2 mm. I have another band that is 2 mm, and it is thicker than this one."
2.0,I have used this bag three times since I received it Saturday. The zipper is already not working correctly. It only clinches in parts and sometimes not at all. I have really been striking out on Amazon lately- might be time for me to go back to good ol' brick and mortar!
2.0,Dull looking.
2.0,"Costume is very fragile, as it tore while trying to put it on.  Seems like it took forever to inflate once the rip was patched up.  Disappointed in its overall quality."
2.0,Very plastic looking and feeling. Got dirty very easily.
2.0,"Don't buy, they are cheaply made.  I never write a bad review but I feel if I walk outside they will fall apart.  Cute in pic"
2.0,"Super cute and hides the tummy nicely. The halter strap was worthless, not wide enough or adjustable. The top it's self is very long. I would recommend going down 1 size, or getting as close as possible to your chest measurements. There isn't much support for larger chested girls. I have a short torso and big boobs, it feels kinda like wearing a pillow case on me. Not my favorite swimsuit, but the pattern is cute."
2.0,"I was not very impressed with this dress. The top part fit decent, but it was quite wide/larger on the bottom and very short for a full length dress! (I am 5'7&#34;, and I would say it would be much more suited for those 5'4&#34; or shorter. Given how wide the bottom is, it would likely make a good maternity dress."
2.0,Did not fit it’s to small
2.0,"I know I'm usually taking a chance when I buy clothes off Amazon but I can usually make it work.  Unfortunately this top was just... Blah.  The shoulder straps won't stay up,  they are too short or something.  Disappointed,  I do not recommend."
2.0,"I initially thought these were great, although the right arm was loose. After a couple of weeks I discovered why: the arms are attached by little bumps that fit into grooves and one is s shorter than the other. The right arm now comes off unexpectedly.<br />I should have read through the reviews before ordering."
2.0,"This ring arrived at a resonable speed. When it arrived i did notice that it was smallee then seen in the picture. I ordered a size 7 which is the size i typically wear but it was to small so youll have to order a1/2 size bigger. The gold looks very cheap. And also the names are very very tiny, hardly readable. As beautiful as the birth  stones are. They where mixed up  with the names. So i guess you have to be very specific when describing the names and stones."
2.0,"see thru fabric, itchy lace"
2.0,I ordered a large even though I typically wear a medium. Even the large was too small.
2.0,Sleeves were too tight and I could not raise my arms comfortably at all. Also didn't care for the look on me. Will be returning.
2.0,"The proportions on the dress are very off. The bodice was 2 inches too short, the shoulders were about an inch too wide, the sleeves over an inch too long. I was sent a Large instead of a Medium but it seemed to be put together with pieces from different sizes. I sent it back. I am not going to order any more dresses from Amazon."
2.0,I received these and was so happy to wear them. I was very disappointed when I put them on. They were too small and there was string hanging everywhere. One seam was coming apart before I even put them on as well. Very poorly made and was disappointed for the fit. Their sizing chart is way off. These are for skinny people. Not real people of the world!!!
2.0,"much bigger than expected (kind of gaudy)!. Most importantly these did not stay on easily, unreliable clasp."
2.0,I used to buy the JMS Stretch Satin hi cuts. I loved them. They stopped making them unfortunately. The material in these panties are too thin and they don't fit around the bottom of the buttocks. Too loose and ride up. Very uncomfortable. They can keep them. They should go back to the Stretch Satin. The material was so comfortable and they fit perfectly for me. Fruit of the Loom FIT FOR ME fit much better and are super comfortable.
2.0,I wear L to XL and bought an XL.  It wasn't as blousy as shown on the model.  Very thin cheap material.
2.0,I didnt like them.  I will gift to a young girl.
2.0,"I opened the package and checked each one as I had expected a few to not work from others reviews.  I was shocked that 17 out of the 40 didn't work.  I was disappointed in how many were dead, but the ones that worked were bright and colorful and made my kids happy."
2.0,I like the ring very much the two colors were great. But after I wore it a couple of days the color started to come off.<br />The size ran true.
2.0,"I absolutely do not like these pants. They fit weird and are extremely unflattering. The material isn’t as comfortable as I’d like—and as I wore them, this weird static cling kept them attached to my legs; drove me crazy.<br /><br />They look almost like pajama pants but aren’t comfy like that. There’s no way they are jogger/gym/exercise pants—I’d never work out in them. I wouldn’t wear them to run errands in either, as the fit is so strange.<br /><br />I wore them to a doctor’s appointment after an injury thinking they’d be soft and comfy but they just felt weird. My boyfriend later told me that I looked 30 years older from the waist down and we laughed about it. I took a look in the mirror and he was right—I needed some orthopedic shoes and a walker. I’m a grandmother but I don’t want to dress like that.<br /><br />They do have some stretch to them and the waistband is wider and the most comfortable part of these pants. That’s the only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1–that waistband is nice and I wish more pants had a wider band that fit comfy instead of binding —that is the only right thing about these pants is the waistband.<br /><br />I am 5’2” and they were longer on me than they show on the model. They fit really baggy and weird.<br /><br />I gave a generous 2 stars but I will absolutely never wear these again and they’ll likely end up in the Goodwill bag."
2.0,Item seemed cheap and was missing white ball at the top
2.0,"Well, not very durable. About half develop holes under the arm after one wearing. The black color version is even worse. I would like to get a few washings out of these before tossing them. Alas, mais non. Two stars."
2.0,Thought it would fit a little better
2.0,"This bag comes folded like an envelope.  You open it up, and I was expecting a thick material and a sturdy bag, but it’s just too weak for me.  The material is almost see-through.  I’m just not a big fan."
2.0,"Poor quality product. Threads were sticking out all over the dress. The semestres does not care about the star placement and how it will fall on the body. I got the small, my usual size and could easily fit 2 of me in the dress. The fabric is also really thick, so it’s super hot if you live in the south. Just a heads up."
2.0,"I ordered a medium, normally wear a small. Fit perfect, although if you have a bigger bottom maybe size up twice, because the medium bottoms are still a little snug on me. Top however is black, every time I wore it, the dye rubbed off on my skin, and I had bluish/black marks all over my ribs,back, chest."
2.0,Poor quality. Ends were frayed and I had to cut it to make it look better. I would return but I need it for tomorrow so not enough time to order a different one. Stitch lines are uneven as well.
2.0,Cheap. I’ll fitting.
2.0,Looks fake :(
2.0,"Inseam is longer than stated, and pants are much baggier than in the product photos. Not slim, and longer than advertised. Material itself is comfortable, so I will keep these for the gym."
2.0,I'm giving it 2 stars because it is soft material and looks comfortable but the size is WAY off.  My 2 year old son is on the small side (in the 10%tile / 29lbs) and wears 2T-3T underwears fine.  I bought this in size 1-2 years and it was huge!  It just feel off him.
2.0,The bottom was a little too &#34;low&#34; for it to be called high waisted and the top was too tight and I ordered 2 sizes up..
2.0,"Product looks exactly like picture, in fact the colors might be even more vibrant than the photos - so that was a plus.  However the suit looks like it was made for girls sizing.  I even ordered up a size, however it was barely covering anything.  Cute concept, execution was way off."
2.0,I love this necklace and I get so many compliments when I wear it but it's falling apart after only wearing it twice. The quality is very poor and it should've been cheaper to buy.
2.0,Fits snug so if your like me and want it a little loose go at least a size up if not more….once it’s washed it’s even smaller!
2.0,Sleeves are a cheap satin material. Will be returning.
2.0,The nice shiny metal in the picture doesn't stay that way for long!  Turns dark and looks very worn after a little while.
2.0,This fits fine except in the arms. They are extremely tight (my arms always fit in clothing)<br /> and there is little give to the material. The material itself is really thick and reminds me of a thick bathing suit or light scuba suit. Don't expect this thing to breathe. I'm typically a medium in women's clothing or a 6-8 in dresses. I can't imagine this fitting someone well who wasn't around my size or a size smaller. However this was purchased for a themed party so it'll do.
2.0,"Mask is -NOT- wearable.<br />I gave it the benefit of the doubt.<br />Tried both SubZero and Scorpion; both fail.<br />There is not enough curvature for a human face.<br /><br />If you're craft savy they appear to make decent starting points for a good mask, otherwise DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Requires heat reforming to shape the mask; I suggest boiling water for even temperature distribution. There are dozens of alternatives on Thingaverse that look better."
2.0,I love the look and feel. Fit was awful and ended up returning
2.0,Ordered a medium but it is too small. Didn't say it was coming from china.
2.0,"Been buying this brand for awhile now.  But this last purchase was not the same.  Compression seems weak and they keep falling down. Order before this one developed holes in them within two months.  Not sure what changed, but this is disappointing.  May try another brand"
2.0,same fabric patterns but my breast are big (36DD/ medium). they run small
2.0,Didn't like it. Went into the trash.
2.0,Very thin material and therefore; see-through.  But most disappointing was that I wore it once for a few hours and the seam at the shoulder started unraveling! I took a needle and thread to sew it back enough to wear again. We'll see if it holds up.  I do NOT recommend this product/vendor.  I bought a robe from the same vendor and it feels and looks cheap as well.
2.0,The fabric is of poor quality and very wrinkled. The hem flares out at the bottom give it a bad shape. Button is cheap but easy to replace. Would not recommend.
2.0,"I had to return.  This was way too small!  Do not order if you have larger arms, it will not fit!  This blouse is for tiny women."
2.0,I didn't expect these earrings to be really big. But other than that they are cute. 😊
2.0,"The pictures that they use to sale it doesn't match with the real watch. I don't like it at all the glass seems to be plate in the photos but it came with a oval glass, wich supposed to be a casual watch into a toy. Not recommend to buy this watch is you are looking for a cool watch, however everything else beside the glass ( for me the most important thing) it's fine"
2.0,"These arrived on time and appeared to be really good quality, but I put them in and within 24 hours, they started irritating my ears. I have left them in for a few days to give my ears time to adjust, but it's not any better. I wish I could return them, but since I have already wore them, I doubt I can. :(<br /><br />If you have any type of sensitive ears, I do not recommend these earrings, but if you don't, then you should be ok. They look really nice, but I will have to find something that works better for me."
2.0,"Brought this item twice and each time the chains broke, I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Looks cheap. Falling apart on arrival... Never wore it.  Wish I'd found something similar on Etsy and paid more.
2.0,"Very thin and cheap! Not a flattering fit, because of its shape. Cheap"
2.0,"Have had this for about a month. Bought it for my wife, and it is hanging up on the key hook more than it's used (probably 80% of the time). She noticed yesterday that the pink portion is scratched up pretty bad from her car key rubbing against it. Would be nicer if it was a thicker coat of paint or a plastic insert... the paint is very thin and scratches with the lightest of pressure."
2.0,It's very beautiful but it's oddly made the busy area was way too big the hip area was too small if I was Jessica Rabbit shaped it would of been a great fit  I got the biggest size they offered and needless to say I will be returning
2.0,"This case seems well constructed but it comes with a very strong, toxic-like smell. I have had it for about a week and it still has a pretty strong smell. I have sprayed it with Fabreeze multiple times, over a few days, but the smell is still there. This seems to be common with items sold directly by Chinese manufacturers on Amazon. They need to add a process to deodorize the merchandise before packaging it, even if it costs an extra buck or two. If you need this case to travel or commute soon, you may want to reconsider if you have a problem with strong smells. It may go away after a few weeks (maybe). If not for that smell, I would have rated this case at 4, maybe 5, stars."
2.0,The stitching on the seams came unraveled under the arms and on the legs.  Better sewing would have made this product last longer. I was disappointed.
2.0,I’m Very sad because they are adorable shoes...I’m buying for my daughter to wear on sunny days and dresses for church but unfortunately this is way to small she wears size 8 and a buy size 9... what a surprise they are like size 6 baby... I know because I compare with my baby shoes who is 6... I don have time to return so I give a baby from my friend.....
2.0,"The quality of these gloves is reflected in the price. I am returning them because you cannot expose the thumbs (as pictured),"
2.0,This belt was too wide to fit the belt loops on any style pants I owned.
2.0,The shirt is nice but runs really small
2.0,The color was not the same as in the picture
2.0,This jacket has several flaws!<br />Missing a button on the left cuff.<br />Damaged button on one of the buttons in the front.<br />Incomplete sewing in several areas.
2.0,"Fabric ok ,ordered a large should of ordered a size up for the oversized look due to large chest"
2.0,"Perfect! Just what I wanted. They are small perfect for everyday wear. Very nice quality. They don't look cheap.<br />UPDATE: they lasted about a year. They started pealing. Not real silver, more like plated. Inacurare description."
2.0,I like that you can adjust the straps and in the front
2.0,"SMALL, SMALL, SMALL. Get at least one size up from your normall."
2.0,"It stopped spinning after a week, I don't know it the anxiety was so high it wore out or if it was just a junk ring."
2.0,"I didn't like these yoga pants, but kept them. They fell apart after about three washes (waste band literally tore when I was putting them on)."
2.0,The item worked but it is only what seems to be an oily sponge.  I expected it to have polish inside the container for more uses.
2.0,Not comfortable to use by someone like me if you have neuropathy. Too much arch.
2.0,"Very good looking watch! Worked fine upon arrival. However, after only about 5 uses it fell apart and is no longer usable. Will be returning."
2.0,The torso is way short and the padded boob cups are way big so if that's you- get it! It's cute. Doesn't fit right but I'm gonna keep it as a back up for if I ever get big fake boobies and shrink 3 inches.
2.0,They are Cute sunglasses and  lightweight. Only bummer the lens had bubbles in the tent. Returning.
2.0,You get what you pay for very cheaply made..
2.0,Didn't hold up for long.
2.0,"I purchased the large satchel and very disappointed in size.  Not well made, will use for work as a school bag , but not very happy."
2.0,"Ordered a large, didn't fit, couldn't even get it past my breast area. I'm usually a medium so I ordered a large to ""be safe"" but was very disappointed"
2.0,This is is not surgical steel. My belly button is now horribly infected from this. Do not buy. Yes it's cute but look for a cute one that's actually good quality
2.0,Printed design does not look good on the material used.<br /><br />Does not look as good as in picture.
2.0,"I coulda worn it as a garter around my thigh so yeah, it runs small!"
2.0,"Decent belt but it has one huge issue.  The metal buckle is huge, and sharp, and after sitting for a little while it digs into your stomach.  Very uncomfortable.  Bummed."
2.0,"As my 3 yr old says, ""not my favorite"" - wish I had looked in stores prior to ordering"
2.0,"My issue with this product is it was shown as a size 13, when we got it it was a European size 33 ( not the same thing!!) the shoe it self looks great and everything, but it does not fit! So before you buy this product please check and recheck the size."
2.0,"Item I received was not what was pictured, the designs were off as well"
2.0,I just got this product and I can't open any of the beads. Which would be great if the bead were already on the bracelet but seeing as I can't get that far it's been a waste of money.
2.0,Look cute but fit too small. And I do not have a large head. I even have a few kids size beanies and I wear them.
2.0,"Runs small, after washing becomes even smaller."
2.0,"The wallet is nice but the key chain fell apart after 5 days of using it. It's unfortunate because I actually like it, oh well..."
2.0,"The earrings are super cute...in the picture.  I finally received them a couple days ago (from China) and they're super huge!!  They don't look that big in the picture.  Unfortunately, I cannot wear them due to their size and weight.  I wish I could though, I loved the picture of them!<br /><br />**I received this item at a discount for my honest review.**"
2.0,They came in a nice box and the designs on them are cool however after wearing a pair for 5 hours the side was so worn out. More of a collector's item. The fabric is way to thin to be worn if you plan on walking at all which is unfortunate because I bought them to be used not to sit on a shelf.
2.0,"Fabric is odd.  Not a sweater or soft material. Shoulder seams are at elbows.  I ordered an XL and this fit loose, but it does not look ANYTHING like photo advertised.  Will be donating to thrift store after our family Christmas pictures are taken.  Cheap fabric."
2.0,"Runs small, but very pretty."
2.0,The blue color is much more like a bright cobalt blue rather than the dark blue pictured.  The fabric is also cheap and thin.
2.0,"Was very thin and  I bought an XLg, fits like a small... Otherwise , was a nice shirt...."
2.0,Not solid purple as pictured has white trim
2.0,"I waited about a year and half to write a review because that is a true test of a piece of luggage.<br /><br />The pieces did not hold up. The zipper on the largest case broke within the first year. The zipper tag fell off on the smaller case, therefore we could not lock the suitcase nor open it without breaking it. Do Not Buy This Se"
2.0,"I ordered these to wear to a color specific wedding, the muted purple tone was perfect for what I needed. When I received the earrings they were not that color at all. They were white and slightly see through. They also just looked a little cheap. Won’t be purchasing from this seller again."
2.0,"The umbrella poll was to thin, to much room inside the hole. Always turning because of the space. Not sturdy enough."
2.0,they don't work for a nose peircing to big and<br />totally looks fake
2.0,It is a cute dress and true to size.  It looks very cheap and I can't imagine it lasting too long.  The seams look as if they will rip open at any time.
2.0,"They are cute and seem like they would hold up good.. however they don’t work for cartilage piercings, they fit but way to big and bulky, they spiral doesn’t fit right for an ear to even attempt to wear"
2.0,"fit nicely, very comfortable, nice stying. really i have nothing but good things to say about them EXCEPT for their durability. didn't take long for the seat to start showing signs of wear, and eventually develop an unforgiving hole in them. this happened on ALL the MK pants i've bought, various styles and colors. fabric fits and feels nice, but the light weight of them may have been their downfall in the seat of the pants."
2.0,Ran huge. Had to return it. Would not buy again.
2.0,"After waiting 7 weeks for its arrival, it's terrible quality material. This isn't cotton but a sheeny almost rayon material, definitely synthetic. Not very high quality. Much larger than expected. Don't recommend."
2.0,WAY too big! And I can't return it!
2.0,Not what I was looking for. That's all.
2.0,Arrived looking like a crushed bathrobe.
2.0,Works for a pinky ring....very small
2.0,"I really didn't like these. I got them for sunglasses and thought the combination looked good, like retro sunglasses. But, it really doesn't work well for sunglasses.<br /><br />As blue-blockers, I assume they do what they're advertised as doing: blocking blue light from digital devices. The problem is that they're very light and when you add the weight of the clip-on sunglasses, they become unbalanced and too heavy in the front. They always want to slide down the nose or fall off. It just doesn't work well as sunglasses. You're better off getting two separate pair of glasses for two separate jobs."
2.0,The bands are too small for my wrist.  Ok for a child an perhaps a teenager
2.0,"These are HUGE. I ordered a 9 women's, which is what I buy in oofos. These shoes are European sizes and they do not correspond with the usual conversion I've seen. These were so large that my spouse could wear them  and he usually wears an 11 men's. Very wide. Not returning because he's keeping them. The ""Army"" green is actually kelly green, btw."
2.0,Bought this for one of my best friends for her birthday. When I got it and checked to make sure it's what I ordered I'm glad I did because it was NOT was I was expecting. One of the sides has a weird... i dont even know how to describe it... almost looks like it was glued to something and then ripped off? And the other sides all look cracked and like they are about to break off! Super disappointed
2.0,"Purchased this for an upcoming fall wedding. The dress is lined in a stark white slip material - the lining should match the dress color but this one is WHITE.  It’s extremely awkward-looking and looks like you’re wearing a bad fitting T-shirt or tank top underneath it - specifically around the bust area. From the side, the white material just stops and looks super weird when you turn. The lace part of the dress is very nice - however they need to reconfigure the lining as it makes the whole presentation look very cheap and badly made. Returning..."
2.0,"The dress looked very cheap in person- the colors, fabric and sewing quality"
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress. I ordered an extra large (green) and a large (grey) to see the difference. I’m regularly a size 14 and both dresses fit very strangely. I liked the idea pockets, but the pockets bulge out and look kind of weird. The stomach hugs in places, but the back is loose and neither size complimented my shape. The length is nice, about ankle length and the fabric is soft. I can see myself wearing them around the house to lounge in but I wouldn’t wear them out."
2.0,The hardware is nice but the leather is really cheap.  Typically you see a dark edge on the belt that fades to brown but this looks like it was done with a sharpie.
2.0,"Pretty, but I wear a size 10 and the large was way too big. I just hate the hassle of returning."
2.0,"They were cute but definitely did not stick as advertised. I didn't even get to use the string part either because they were already too close together. I do believe they may work for someone so I think the positive reviews were true, just not for me :("
2.0,"I wish I could give more stars. These are cute and comfy. The problem is I have only had them  a couple weeks, haven’t worn then more than 5 times, washed twice and the neck already is stretched out and looks like a t-shirt I have had for many years. I am really disappointed."
2.0,"I ordered this for myself, and it is too small. It does fit my wife; she is 5'2"" tall and weighs 108 lbs.  I'm 5'10"" and 175 lbs."
2.0,I like the color and style but they do not keep my finger tips warm at all
2.0,These are not Computer readers. They are standard readers to use for reading up close. Computer readers help you focus on a computer screen which is further away than something you may hold in your hands.
2.0,CHEAPPPPPP LOOKING<br />The butterfly broke off
2.0,"it fit fine, very cheaply made. I wore it out while i was sitting there it broke! looking for cheap costume jewelry to maybe last one night then this is fine."
2.0,"fits on my wallet, but i didn't buy it for my wallet... large clasps do not fit to hold my phone's case like my last pocket chain. will not be buying again. cheap small links, that together are strong but individually are weak and frail. easily gets bent or kinked and is hard to fix due to the large number of chain links. i will not be buying this chain again.<br />i suppose i will have to go shopping in person to be able to compare the clasp piece to the hole on my phone's case."
2.0,But had I got is pretty but way too large for me I can't keep it on my head I would like a return shipping label paid so I can return it and get my money back I can't wear it way too large
2.0,This was a gift which arrived broken and had to be returned as soon as revived. She was disappointed.
2.0,I sent these back because they didn't fit well and the color wasn't as expected.
2.0,In theory this watch seemed pretty but in person it was a different story. I thought the watch face had a 3D kind of texture on it but it turned out to just be printed on the back. And the stars were weirdly aligned so my brain kept wanting to tell the time by seeing which hands of the clock were facing which stars but the stars are randomly placed. So they aren't markers to tell the time. Needless to say I returned it to find something that better suited my style and functionality.
2.0,Thin material. Smaller and shorter than picture. Poor to fair quality.
2.0,I was expecting the fleece lining to be a bit thicker than what these are...I have purchased better leggings that cost even less than these!
2.0,I guess somehow i missed the petite part.  It was way too tiny for me.
2.0,Did not fit adult. Sunglasses were given to six year old child-better fit. Very disappointed as this was sent as a mother's day gift.
2.0,"it fit, but was shorter than pictured. ended up regifting it"
2.0,"This is basically a necklace. They are too big around to stay up and on an adult's face in the first place and then material is so sheer it provides no protection from dust or droplets. The fabric is smooth and cool to the touch, but otherwise useless."
2.0,"When I initially tried these sandals on in a store I was blown away with just how comfortable they were. I had been a Teva wearer for about ten years with an old leather pair that were stretched out and well past their sell by date. I had decided to move away from the new leather style because of the cheap looking appearance.<br /><br />The look of the Terra Fi 3 is great. A well built sandal with a great footbed and the shock pad gives wonderful cushioning under the heel for my bad back. My first impressions were completely reinforced when I wore them for the first time.<br /><br />However, the more I wore them the less I like them. When driving in them, the shock pad which was such a boon initially, makes you feel like there is a stone permenently under your heel, and no matter how you position your foot it just won't go away. It doesn't stop there, it gets worse. After driving for an hour or so, even walking becomes a problem with the shockpad, because your heel is so irritated.<br /><br />If I was to buy again, I certainly wouldn't buy these sandals, purely because of the shock pad."
2.0,Ugly as sin much bigger and bulkier than seen here.
2.0,"Had the watch and the band broke,dropped and cracked the crystal on the face of the watch.Have to call customer service.The band was cheaply made."
2.0,The I ordered a xl the one I got fit like an large
2.0,This does not fit like it was made for a person. 95% of this dress was too big and the armholes felt like they were child sized. Not a fan. This was returned.
2.0,"Was very happy with this watch when I first opened it, but after less than a week of wear the thermometer has fallen off and the compass has started to come loose.<br /><br />The watch itself works well and seems to be decent quality, but the compass and thermometer are disappointing."
2.0,Sadly they loosen and fall off. Not great if you want to use it for dicier attachment.
2.0,I never say don't buy when getting a bad item as my experience may be different than yours but with that being said the necklace arrived with a broken chain which was no big deal in my opinion..chains can be replaced but then I noticed that a birthstone was missing off one of the feet which was disappointing it was a shame because my wife really wanted this necklace but luckly I found a better one elsewhere
2.0,Light doesnt light up the screen...
2.0,"I have several jumpsuits from PrettyGarden and have been happy with all of my purchases.  This dress looks very cute in the pictures and was such a great price I decided to buy it.  Overall sizing is probably accurate the problem is the waistline does not come down to your waist.  It is a couple of inches above your waist (and I’m short waisted); not a very flattering fit.  There are ties on the shoulder straps but these are for looks only, not adjustable.<br />The Material is a lite polyester with gauze fee/look.  I would not recommend this dress, this one is a MISS for Pretty Garden. Might look good on a tall, super skinny model but then everything hangs well on them 😉<br />I returned dress."
2.0,"Too soft, not very good fabric. Quality is not good."
2.0,"I ordered the size XL. I'm giving it two stars because it arrived fast and was really cute- but the sizing is WAY off, I would say this would fit a size medium comfortably. Couldn't even get it past my chest, usually a size L-XL and this was supposed to be oversized. Sending her back!"
2.0,The stitching came out within an hour of receiving the tie.
2.0,"I love the cut and design of this dress, but it is very cheaply made. I wore it once or twice and it looks faded/pilled. The fabric is very light and flimsy. In short: if you want something to wear once, it will probably do the trick, but if you want a wardrobe staple you can wear for a couple of seasons, this will probably not work for you."
2.0,"That hat itself is seems a little large for the age range.  My biggest complaint is that the chin strap, even when adjusted, hangs way too low so it isn't functional."
2.0,"This is comically large, I can't even."
2.0,"The boots are light weight, but the shoes don’t protect you from dirt and dust entering the boot. After a day’s work you feet end up jamming into the steel toe, and it becomes very uncomfortable."
2.0,Fit much shorter than expected despite ordering two sizes up. Chinese XL fits like U.S. medium.
2.0,"The fit on this dress was not flattering for my body type so I returned. The quality is good though, and it is stylish. Just not well suiting on me."
2.0,"Used silicone sealant to put on screw since was very hard to unscrew and screw … pain in a neck to adjust time and calendar even putting on silicone sealant …<br />Looks good at a glance , don’t think I’ll go into the pool"
2.0,bought the size to fit 18 months to 2 years. Too small for a 15 month old and shrunk during washing.
2.0,It is not real leather.
2.0,Really cute granddaughter loves it but zipper is bad after a week of use
2.0,I have a latex skin condition and even though these are latex-free why when I put them on did it seem like there was a powder coating inside buyer beware I put a note into the seller hopefully they get back to me
2.0,It's okay I guess.. not made very well or really cute. It'll be okay for a back up.
2.0,The gloves were nice but I the touch response wasn't great.  Returned.
2.0,"My biggest problem with this ""sweatshirt"" is that it's NOT a sweatshirt!!! It's just a long sleeve shirt and I'm not really fond of the texture. Also, ordered the blue and it's a funky blue."
2.0,cute dress but runs very small.
2.0,The top is entirely too small. The bottoms fit great though. Sucks can’t wear it as a set.
2.0,Way too small - I am a 14/16 regularly 40 waist
2.0,Way too small. Had to send them back.
2.0,"My wife, whom is Wicca, absolutely adored this pendant. She wore it for a night, woke up the next morning and had a rash all the way around her neck in the shape of the pendant. It's a gorgeous piece, but the cheap metal was definitely a massive bummer. In no way am i blaming the creator as i do understand that not everyone is allergic to cheap metals. It was just an unfortunate happening."
2.0,"These fit well and look just like the pictures, however, the package that I received had been worn and washed. They smelled of old body odor."
2.0,Calidad acorde al precio
2.0,It was good for the party I needed. But the tail was matted and so was the hair on the ears. Probably only worth $10 but I was in a pinch
2.0,"I bought this bed jacket because I found out too late that the one I wanted couldn't be shipped.  What a disappointment. The picture shows a luxurious fabric. NOT!  It shows a vibrant red wine color.  NOT!  This bed jacket is very thin and looks dull and washed out. Unfortunately, I don't have time to replace it before Christmas, so I'm pretty much stuck with it.  It came shrink wrapped very tightly so it's a wrinkled mess. I'm going to wash and fluff dry it to try to salvage it as a gift.  I'm very disappointed, especially for the price I paid.<br /><br />Edit.  I washed it and although most of the wrinkles came out, I just could not bring myself to give this as a gift. It just looks bad.  I'm returning it for a refund."
2.0,"The bill is metallic, which you can't quite tell in the picture. The hat as a whole is smaller than I would have liked...not the look I was going for. Cute raffia weave though!"
2.0,necklace broke as I took it out of the package. Never received a reply from seller......not worth trying to pay to return it.....guess I will just buy a new necklace to put it on since it is a super cute charm.
2.0,"I don't usually give negative reviews but I don't thnk this looks anything like the picture. It remind me of putting on a garbage bag, not attractive at all. Guess it would be good just to throw in a suitcase if it rained on a trip. I'm returning it though."
2.0,The large top was not very large and the large bottom was a little too large.
2.0,Not good quality either.  Returned.  Didn't even have a tag with size on it so I am not sure they even sent the right size.
2.0,The blue bracelet came much darker than in the photo. I'm mad because the person already had a dark blue but it's a gift. too late to return
2.0,[[VIDEOID:8a88b49dace937ae670829f2cd8395ba]] Bag looks good but other than that it’s not fit for any type of serious use. There is zero padding in the shoulder straps and the fasteners are not sewn on the ends so they just slip right through. Zipper are difficult to slide.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"The size belt I received does not add up with what I ordered, this belt is much smaller and now I’m having an issue trying to return or exchange. Could be there out of stock .  Order larger than what you need"
2.0,"The lights stopped working too soon, compared to other light up shoes of the same price"
2.0,"I bought four of these for bridesmaid dresses based on all the positive reviews, but when I received it, the design of the dress was clearly unacceptable.  The picture makes it look like the seam between the waist and bodice would fit just under the bust, but in trying it on, that seam hit midbust, which felt very unnatural and uncomfortable.  I was very disappointed and had to return all four dresses of this style that I bought.  I wrote this review so that others would be warned of this problem."
2.0,"I buy 2, and let me tell you the product is nice and soft súper comfortable. But for any reason they send me my products separately, I bought 2 and just got one. At the end they didn’t give me a replacement or a refund saying shipping was not their problem and I was under a shipping contract that makes them being not responsible if the item is lost after it shows “delivered” I did another review but apparently they said it could not be post. So be careful about that option"
2.0,The gold part is not aligned with the earrings as pictured.
2.0,It’s a cute dress but there are unfinished(and snipped in some places) seams and the fit is VERY small. There is absolutely no give in the fabric. Even with the darts I could not pull the dress over my chest. Unless you can get measurements prior to purchasing I would not recommend buying. The large doesn’t even fit my 13 year old y’all and lean daughter.
2.0,"Lovely necklace - color, size, style.  Problem is that it came broken and I did manage to find some of the pieces and glued them in but not all.  Couldn't be bothered to return it."
2.0,"Not quite the quality I expected for the price. Seems like it should be selling for about $12. The top is hard and the cooling band is nothing more than a strip of material around the brim. The top is very hard and not soft around your head at all. Feels like you are wearing one of those cheap straw hats. The brim also flops over both directions without your effort and can look absolutely stupid if it flops down and you don't notice it. For $39, not very good."
2.0,Took forver to comr and verrrrrry small
2.0,its made out of leather and steel so if you are planning on use while you might sweat it'll probably get ruin quite fast... also doesnt have any mechanism to reduce its lenght
2.0,"Not really what I wanted, it's very obvious when it's on your finger. It sticks up a lot from the top of your hand and just looks a little silly and clunky to me. I don't wear it so I can't say what the quality is like, but it feels a little cheap."
2.0,"I washed this once before wearing it. The fabric is pilling and rubbing off everywhere it runs against something (on my chest against my purse, on my wrists against my keyboard). The fit it is okay but the top is wide in the waist and of very thin fabric. You can see any type of bra through it."
2.0,This dress is beautiful. However the material is awful. I only had it on for about 30 minutes and it ripped in about 4 or 5 different places. Every time I moved the thin strings came apart. I loved the way it looked on me and the size was perfect and I would have loved to get the dress in multiple colors but now I can't because they won't even last for a day.
2.0,absolutely huge studs. pretty much unwearable. gave them to my mom for costume jewelry.
2.0,"It fits great. But, it came with black scuff marks all over it. It is very loose on the actual watch it’s self. I am hoping I can wash the black scuff marks off it."
2.0,Super soft. Didn't fit up top at all.
2.0,"You can't tell from the pic or description but this has cups and a separate section for breasts. If you are large chested, the elastic from the separate sectioning will cut you across your breasts. Ouch. Another item that came while we were out of town and can't be returned because the window is closed by 3 days."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this. It's pretty in the picture, the color is gorgeous and the material feels nice, but the cut just does not work. It might work better on someone with larger breasts, but on me it just looks like l haphazardly draped some nice material around my torso. For reference I'm 5'9"", 145pounds, 34C and got a medium. Small wouldn't work either because the arms would be too tight."
2.0,This purse did not come as it looks on the picture! It's almost a bluish grey. Disappointed in the color hoping it was light blue as showed in the picture. Also smaller than expected.
2.0,"The bar is surgical steel, not “flexible” at all, as advertised. Was disappointed, as I wanted something more dental friendly.  The balls are plastic, so they will suffice until I find what I’m really looking for."
2.0,Way too small!! The size is not even close to the correct US sizes. They need to revise their size charts. This is beautiful dress but couldn’t even get my girls into the cups!!
2.0,I will need help to return this product
2.0,This purse is stiff and not a good looking purse. Looks better in their photo. Don't waste your money.
2.0,This shirt was a super uncomfortable material. The hem line and the neck/chest line was not as depicted. I ended up returning it! Return was easy.
2.0,"**Update**  I used this belt daily, and while I liked its fit & wear, it has failed after 9 months.  The rivet failed.  (See attached)  dropped to 2 stars.  Reading other reviews this buckle seems to fail regularly.  I don't think I will buy again.<br /><br />I really like the belt.  Once you get used to the latching (and unlatching) mechanism you will love it.  You definitely need to practice releasing the latching mechanism, if not and you have a sudden need to use the bathroom, you might find yourself in a panic mode trying to get the belt off!  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the tongue of the belt is extra long and there is no way to adjust its length.  It would be nice if it were an inch or two less in length.  I'd buy this belt again."
2.0,"This belt was much cheaper quality than I expected.  It's OK.  The color is kind of weird, so I haven't worn it."
2.0,Very cute bathing suit BUT it runs EXTREMELY small! I'm a Medium and ordered an XL based on their sizing chart and it was still very snug.
2.0,3 white one yellow. Not anywhere near as pretty as their picture. Not giftable in my opinion. Would do better to pick out your own.
2.0,The neck scoops way to low for my 3 yr olds. It fits way to big. Size 2-3 should be on the smaller size.
2.0,Not too impressed with it. Way too narrow and short to wrap like they tell you unless you are slender. Makes a good scarf though.
2.0,"These pants fit small in the hip and thigh, and very long. I didn't find them flattering, and returned them."
2.0,"If you have thin legs, these are for you. The top was like a rubber band which would cut off circulation not aid it! Thicker than I thought they would be."
2.0,"I was super excited to order this dress because of the style and fit. But when I got it and tried it on, it was baggy, super long, and the top of the dress wasn’t like the picture."
2.0,Too small. I did not like the material.
2.0,Runs very small order at least 3 sizes larger.
2.0,"I ordered my correct US size, but the product that I got was too small by at least a couple of inches everywhere."
2.0,This is a beautiful and functional looking wallet. I truly loved it. Only wish it was sturdy. The cardboard or components to stiffen the wallet was exposed after the edges peeled off and had to get a new wallet from another manufacturer.
2.0,Not made well. The picture on the bag was crooked
2.0,"huge! rise is above my belly button .but would be .great if you have a large abdomen, and tall."
2.0,"I purposely ordered a size larger and it was still way to small in the bust area, they are not at all true to size. I returned it."
2.0,"Larger than expected, and material has a strange smell."
2.0,"The glasses fit well and I likes the design. But as you can see from the picture, they did not darken....AT ALL. I took this photo after being outside in the sunlight for several hours and then driving home in the daylight. Found myself squinting the entire time. At $26 price point, not a value at all for just bifocals."
2.0,It was fine at the waist but really big at the bottom. The material was regular denim though. I thought it would’ve been jegging material. I wear a size three and four in jeans and a medium in most of my clothes. But it said it ran small so I got a medium should’ve went a size down.
2.0,I dont like fabric at all. Neck line is to low. poor quality
2.0,I bought these specifically because the description mentioned they were less prone to break--wrong! My son snapped the plastic hinge piece where the ear piece folds right in half after he only wore them a few of times.
2.0,"Very cheap material, had to return, not worth the money"
2.0,"Not as colorful as pic. Its basically a tan shirt with black writing. NO orange, green, blue, pink like picture. There is a light chartreuse green block in the upper right, but that's it for color... Terribly Disappointing"
2.0,Nearly see through.....
2.0,"Not as reflective as shown in the pictures. Also two of the 12 sunglasses are not reflective at all, just a light shade of black which isn’t shown in the picture at all. Seems like false advertising if you ask me."
2.0,I thought the belt was suppose to strap on a different way. Its a good belt but not to my personal taste.
2.0,Very cute and fits everywhere but the chest. Had to return
2.0,May be just me but they were too itchy for me to wear. I passed them on to someone else who wore them over a different material.
2.0,It was too small even though I got the large size like I wear in most jackets.
2.0,They fit fine in length but the width is very narrow so I have to return.
2.0,So I rated this 2 stars because it doesn’t fit. Even after measuring the neck and it was significantly less than the collar is supposed to be.. and I can’t comment for value or comfort for that reason. It is nice though... if you have a smaller neck and it fits.
2.0,I love the shirt and my daughter is in love with it but there are black spots on the gold design. My daughter does not want me to return it so i won't.
2.0,Too much threat's hanging all over plus it has lots of areas that are not sewed.
2.0,Weird material.  Expected spandex like material. This is not. Not a fan. Fit was fine. Just not comfortable material.
2.0,sizes waaaaayyyy too small
2.0,Se rompió muy fácil sólo 2 semanas me duro
2.0,Looks cheap. The photo looks better
2.0,Tight in odd places. Uncomfortable fabric
2.0,Awkward fit/ runs big. Unflattering. Quality is good though. I’m 5’8” and 130 lbs with size 27 waist. Got a small.
2.0,bunches up
2.0,You get what you pay for.  I would give it a 4* for its price if it came not missing a rhine stone on the peacock body
2.0,I took put as many links allowed and the band was still too big.
2.0,I ordered two sizes larger than normal and tight. Do not like but may use in a pinch. Ugg!
2.0,"I really like this bracelet, and have received several compliments on it during the month that I've owned it. I've worn it 2-3 times a week, and the rose &#34;gold&#34; finish is wearing off. Very sad it wasn't a better quality finish..."
2.0,Cute pajamas but run way small. I will probably return and order bigger sizes and fabric seems like it will shrink.
2.0,"Planned to wear it to a breed specific dog show, but not that nice. Although the shirt is an Eddie Bauer, it is shockingly poorly made.  The color is beautiful, but shirt is skimpily sized, thin, and cheap looking.  The embroidered dog emblem does not look like the breed I selected and is also very cheap looking."
2.0,"I got this mask for my pro 2A husband. For $11 I expected better quality. It's nothing more than a cheap thin mask that looks like it was meant for children. My husband, who has an average face and has no problem with normal masks, now walks around with his ears pulled forward because the elastic is so short."
2.0,It has no shape or body especially to the sides. They flop all over. Ok for a tote bag I guess but not a purse also smelled bad when I opened it but it was ok after a couple hours.
2.0,The measurements for top was not what it listed.
2.0,This is a nice looking dress however not a good choice if you're hippy.  Not happy with the fit.
2.0,"I am a mechanic and have to get elbows deep into things sometimes. The original wristband was reliable and able to hold on despite the work I did. However it wore out over time and required replacement. This product arrived in a timely manner and is comfortable, but the clasp comes undone far too easily. There have been times when I have almost thrown my Gear Fit across the room because of how often I have to reconnnect it. A very frustrating product unless you don't use your whole arm during work or activities, then it is fine."
2.0,IT looks like a tent!
2.0,"HARD TO ADJUST BAND.  U  COULD EASILY HAVE USED PINS, TO PUSH-OUT,  INSTEAD OF SCREWS ON BAND. IT'S NOT A ROLEX.  WOULD HAVE SIMPLIFIED IT.  I SERVICE ALL WATCHES AND HAVE GERMAN AND ROLEX TOOLS......INCLUDING THE PROPER SCREWDRIVERS.  YOUR SCREW HEADS ARE DISTORTED, ILL-FORMED AND IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE. RESULT ???? A NEW WATCHBAND IS NEEDED....UNLESS YOU'RE A GORILLA.  ATTHIS PRICE-POINT, I'M SURE IT WILL BE SHORT-LIVED.  FOLLOWUP 2/14----AFTER TRYING TO DJUST BAND,I GAVE-UP.....NO GO. ''AUTO'' FEATURE OF MOVEMENT......VERY POOR.  LOSES MINUTES IN FEW HOURS AND STOPS. POOR !"
2.0,"I ordered the same exact dress in black.. this grey dress fit smaller than the black( although they are same size ), and the strap was sewn twisted ( so I had to remove stitches and resew correctly )  also this dress us more of a scoop neck...NOT a V neck<br />Besides that, the dress is ok- I kept it"
2.0,"I bought this for a Timex 22mm lug-width watch. The leather straps were a little too wide and too thick to fit between the pins and the watch. Also, the band was much too stiff and the particular shade of brown was very bland, lacking the richness of other brown Nemesis straps."
2.0,"This is the first chin strap I have tried, so I have nothing to compare to. In order for it to work it must be snugged tightly by the velcro strap at the crown of the head, which is uncomfortable to me. It is very difficult to find a comfortable balance in order to keep my mouth shut and be able to sleep with the tighness of the strap. It is also won't stay in place throughout the night. The part that goes under my chin is a little to wide for me. I used it for a week then set it aside. I wanted it to keep from awakening from snoring, but the strap caused me to wake up even more often than my mouth falling open. Perhaps a different style may work for me. Fortunately, this one is not very expensive if you'd like to try it. Different designs may work differently on different people."
2.0,It is very beautiful and looks expensive. I had to return it because the date would not adjust. I ask for replacement but they would only refund. I contacted seller but they were reluctant to solve to issue.<br />So in my opinion the waranty means nothing. They ask to contact them if any problem with product but failed to attempt any resolution. I cannot recomend buying from this seller or this brand.
2.0,"I ordered this thinking finally a bra that will fit, bigger sizes without payer over 40dollars. I actually ordered a size up and it was way to small. I ordered a size E and it fit like a DD, definitely not true to size. Really nice looking and feeling though. To bad I can't use."
2.0,Material does not seem the best in the fit seemed a little off. The dress seemed a bit small.
2.0,"I usually don't order shoes online and, I wish I hadn't ordered these!  When I read the positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  I ordered a pair for me and a pair for my hubby.  Honestly, when I first received them, mine were slightly larger than I expected and my husbands were NOT even the size that I ordered. Right away, I went to website to see if I made the error and &#34;no&#34; it wasn't my mistake.  I then, reordered his in the correct size and set up to return the SIZE 12 that were sent in error.  In order to send the wrong slippers back, I would have to drive a good 15 miles away or I would have to pay for return shipping :(<br />Long story short, I did not return the size 12's and, the other 2 pair of slippers were so stretched out after 2 weeks that neither one of us can wear them at all, not even with socks on!  They're sooooo loose, they fall right off !!  Very dissatisfied with Beurlike slippers  :(<br />The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because even though they felt loose, they were ok for the first week or so..."
2.0,"Narrow through the shoulders but good length & so soft. When trying to return, they offered partial refund due to lengthy & costly return process - I accepted & will give this shirt away - someone will love it!"
2.0,Super cute the first wear- the hoody shrunk up after the first wash. I'm talking shrunk to 3/4 sleeve length.
2.0,"These did not work well for me.  I had a pair of dress shoes with heels that cannot be replaced.  These plates did not solve the problem.  First, the adhesive came off when removing the cover.  Second, takes skill to tap in five nails without bending them.  Third, they last only a day or two."
2.0,"This is a pretty winter cap knitted in a winter white acrylic yarn. It is soft and flattering to wear. While I really like the cap it arrived with some dropped stitches, which has left a hole. This is a looser weave knitting stitch, which I think added to this issue. Since I sew I will be able to stitch this up and wear it myself but I would not feel comfortable giving it as a gift. Other reviews don’t mention anything like this so my hat was probably just a fluke. If not for the dropped stitches, I would have rated this four stars."
2.0,It comes loose often.
2.0,"I was disappointed in the quality of the fabric. It was chintzy and wrinkly. If I was buying it in the store and was able to touch the fabric...I wouldn't have bought it. But getting it delivered at home, and having my husband wear it once and laundering it...I really AM more disappointed than when I first got it delivered.  But since he wore it, I'm going to let him continue to wear it because he said he doesn't mind if it's ""sloppy looking, I'll wear it just for in the house?"""
2.0,"This is really pretty cheap and it doesn't have a clip to stay on the ear. It just has some metal you squeeze shut, it will eventually break. I'm not that happy with it."
2.0,Disappointed I tried on the same pair at the good feet store and they fit. But when I got these they are too big.
2.0,"LOVED this watch band - however it lasted a week - exactly one week in, the hardware holding the strap/that connects the watch came apart.  the small screw in the hardware came out.  I thought that I could fix b/c - and I could fix.  I got myself the tiniest screwdriver ever and thought it was fixed..... but an hour later - the damn screw came out again.  I have tried one additional time to hope it works - unfortunately it ididn't work.  Not thrilled."
2.0,This is a verrrry thin sweatshirt. The print is cute but runs quite small (I'm normally a medium) and it's not a crowl neck - it's a hood. Returned this unfortunately.
2.0,wasnt flattering to the body. ordered a large but still felt tight
2.0,"Fabric is quite thick, it feels like you'd be sweating in it if the weather happens to be a little stuffy. I had to return it because the large ended up too large for me. I'm 5'3&#34; and about 140, so if you are thinking about getting it and you're around my size, I'd go for a medium. The sky blue color ended up looking very &#34;maid-like&#34; to me. Would make a decent costume dress."
2.0,"I bought these gloves because of the good reviews.  The first time I used them, my fingers were freezing, almost immediately.  I was shoveling snow in 10 degree weather.  Didn't expect my hands/fingers to get that cold. Probably not bad for warmer weather, but not recommended for really cold days."
2.0,The shoes are not good-looking. They are not suitable for wearing. They are too small.
2.0,Received it dirty with a mark. It is a lot longer than expected.
2.0,Not a fan of the fabric. And want as long as It looked in the picture
2.0,"It was difficult to remove links to adjust the size, so I had to bring it to my watch repair place.  Thankfully they only charged me $10, but it took quite some time for them to keep removing links and checking.  The person commented that he did not think it was a good design.  It looks ok on my Deep Blue diver watch, but the edges can be sharp and pull on arm hair, so I will probably remove it."
2.0,The alarm function does not work.
2.0,Coming apart after 1 month
2.0,Product runs extremely small!!
2.0,Too small and the fabric was cheap fabric. Ended up ordering a different corset.
2.0,Very thin. But will be good for photos. It's too thin for normal wear.
2.0,They are very cute nose rings but they are waaaay too big for my nose but I didn't see the size so pass check the size before purchasing
2.0,"A bit too bulky for earrings, they do not hang correctly"
2.0,these are comfortable but wear out in heels quick - also too expensive for the life of them
2.0,"Be prepared to wear a belt with this, and it does also ride up while walking."
2.0,I’m giving the dress 👗 to my sister as a gift 🎁
2.0,"Well, my fault!!!! Always remember that you get what you pay for!  Took a long time to receive......did not know that it was coming straight from China, literally!!!!  Never again!!!  When I did get it, I liked the color (brown) and I liked the style, but it looked like it was constructed by a child!  So sad!  Beware!!"
2.0,"The fabric is so bad at picking up everything it comes in contact with that I can’t wear it away from home. Still love it and wear it here on the farm and is now covered with seeds, animal hair and sawdust. If you live in the city it should be fine."
2.0,Does have a smell even after multiple washings.  No cotton.
2.0,"The color of this jumpsuit is not the same as the picture. The jumpsuit also looked weird on me. I am 5'3, and It did not fit right, so I returned it."
2.0,This isn't real 925 silver do not buy it. It isn't marked anywhere on the jewelry and the chain looks like a chain out of a gumball machine. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!
2.0,Looks big on the picture but way too small in reality
2.0,[[VIDEOID:bbd9c9b25afdf1b43c47a9b492edfed4]] Love the colors and design but I don't like the poor quality of construction. They basically sewed it on top instead of a seem. Which would work if it had print on both sides of the fabric but it does not. I also wish it was a silky fabric instead.
2.0,"I went with my foot measurement and not my usual shoe size and these shoes are painfully small! I cannot stand in these shoes comfortably. I'm sure if I could have ordered a whole size up they would be fine.But the fact that I went with the size chart and it was incorrect, and the majority of the reviews I read were about how well the shoes fit is irritating. I'm currently trying to stretch the shoes out since the leather is soft. Hopefully that will solve my problem."
2.0,"These laces are just like the ones for sale in the Dollar Store, 8 pairs for $1.25.  Meh."
2.0,I ordered a size large the item would barely fit someone that wears a small. The sweater was pretty but sizing is way off.
2.0,"Too much padding, runs small would not buy again."
2.0,JD baby cap did not fit....needs elastic in back & made deeper....<br />Shame...could be really cute ...as bought with JD coveralls & booties..
2.0,"1/15/19 after less than 2 years of working, it just stopped one day. I thought the batteries were dead, so I replaced them. This did not fix the problem, the LED worked, but it would not turn the watches. With a little time, I was able to take this apart and find the culprit, there is a small ""rubber band"" that goes from the drive motor to a drive gear, this broke. The motor still turns, and if the band were not broken this would still work. I am looking for a replacement band and am hoping the manufacturer will step up and send a replacement. I am not holding my breath.<br />I replaced the band with a small rubber band of comparable size. But not a very strong one. The winder is working again, but I would love to be able to have access to replacement bands as this is going to break again.<br /><br />So far running on AC and I love it. This thing is whisper quiet. Keeps my watches wound and looks great. I had planned on putting this in the closet where I do not have an AC outlet. When I do move it, I will report on how it performs on batteries.<br />9/13/17 Update running on batteries. I did not pay much attention to the first set of batteries. I installed the 2nd set on July 1, 2017. I run this in the CW rest CCW rest mode which I believe winds for 3 minutes in one direction, then rests for 30 minutes, then winds the other direction for 3 minutes, rest for 30, and repeat 24x7. I would turn the LED on then off just to check if the batteries were dead. After 6 weeks the LED failed to illuminate and I figured the batteries were dead. They were not, they just do not have enough juice to power the LED, but plenty of power to run the motor. It is now mid September and it is still running. 10 weeks and counting on 2 Duracell C cells.<br />1/26/18 Update: the 2 C cell batteries last 2.5 months without any issue. After that I noticed that one of the watches was starting to lose time. so I now change the batteries every 10 weeks. I am looking at another automatic watch, so I may need another winder. If I buy another automatic watch, I will buy this winder again."
2.0,Didn’t do anything for me. Not tight. It’s just sloppy looking. I like tailor fitted shirts for work. The material is cheap looking
2.0,"Arms are too tight, not true to size.  Everything else is fine."
2.0,"I am 5'3 and this was WAY too short on me to wear to work in a corporate office setting- even with flats!  I love the style, the fabric and the sleeves are so pretty....but where is the other half of this dress?!?!?!  It is literally a mini skirt attached to cute sleeves - very disappointing."
2.0,"I followed the companies sizing chart exactly, the jacket is just barely long enough in the arms but HUGE in every other part. I’m swimming in it but can’t go down in size or else the sleeves will go up to my elbows."
2.0,"Poor quality, felt already coming apart.  Beading is also bad, you can see through the bare spots.  Just doesn’t look like the stock photo."
2.0,I had to wash it and dry it for it to look ok on me. May even have to take in the sides under my arms. It’s very large. I’m 5’6” 143 and I could have got a small.
2.0,"I bought an XL, which 9 times outta 10 always fits me. And this shirt takes ""cropped"" to a new level. I put the shirt on (which is completely see through because the material is so thin) and it barely goes past my boobs. The only reason why i'm keeping it is because i'm wearing this under a dress so it will work for that particular outfit. But I would never wear this by itself. So if you want it to look like the picture, I wouldn't buy. Not to mention the only part of this shirt that's got the lettuce trim is the neck, the sleeves are straight edged."
2.0,"Cute, but theres a little rust spot on it and I havent even had it a month yet."
2.0,Item is very small and will not fit above size B cup. Elastic support band is much smaller than picture shows and fit is uncomfortable . Skip this product.
2.0,Had to modify backing to get on earring. They bend very easily and out of place trying to push onto earring.
2.0,"I guess I should have looked a little closer as to what is actually included in this 5 piece set. After receiving the product, I look one look at it and knew I would never wear most of these. You receive 1 white plastic bead bracelet, 1 black plastic bead bracelet, 1 gold plastic bead bracelet, 1 black rose bracelet, and 1 gold and silver stud bracelet. The ONLY bracelet I wear is the black rose bracelet. Everything else looks extremely cheap."
2.0,"This is not what I expected. It was really big on me (i'm 5'1&#34;, 117 lbs) and did not stop at the knees. I didn't like the fit at all and the material was extremely stiff."
2.0,"Headband was broken,  was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she couldn’t wear the best part of it."
2.0,Runs big.  Nice show. Slippery on the bottom
2.0,to heavy. not staying on nose
2.0,"It's hit or miss, some blouse's just run smaller.  😪 but I had to give to my friend."
2.0,This ring honestly feels like a toy ring you would give your niece at 4 years old. Not very ideal for any serious purpose. Think very closely as to what you plan on doing with the ring or else don't buy it.
2.0,It’s cute but if you’re a size 18/20 then the 4X will work. I’m a size 28/30 and it doesn’t fit at all. Also the order took forever to get here. But over all it’s cute
2.0,The description says headband sets.  These are only the hair clips. Reviews even talked about bands being too loose or too tight so I was under the impression I was getting clip and headband. Very disappointed to see it was clip only. Would not have purchased at this price had that have been clear.
2.0,"It is light weight, and fits more like a sleep shirt than a day use short."
2.0,I DEF HAVE MIXED FEELINGS REGARDING THIS OUTFIT. ITS CUTE BUT ON DOESNT LOOK AS NICE. MAYBE IT IS JUST ME
2.0,"Love Timex not so sure about seller, watch does not keep time, on my 2nd battery. Very sad. Corrine"
2.0,Been looking for replacement gloves and these were too large even though they were smalls.
2.0,"These feel really cheap and are definitely not something I would wear out in public. They don't fit well and look super wrinkled all the time. I mean these may work for some people, but they are definitely not something I would get."
2.0,"It’s just OK, wasn’t wowed by the sweater, it’s very thin and rough material."
2.0,"Item fits as expected.  Color is more like a nurses uniform and I'm not sure I will keep it.  If you tend to sweat, this will show that as well."
2.0,to sleep  gown too small for a 2x zise
2.0,Nice until you have to wash and dry. Now it's too small and has tiny lint balls all over it from the cheap material.
2.0,"Not the same dress as the picture. Mine is short in the front and long in the back with large pokadotas not small as the picture shows. It is also cheaply made and somewhat see through, 2 star bc it's a great bathing suit cover up but purchased as a dress."
2.0,I only got to wear these sunglasses twice before the handle broke. The material shouldn't have been made with cheap plastics but a sturdy metal. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,"Girlfriends finger didn't fit, Cant return it, looks like cheap material anyway."
2.0,"It's cheaply glued, cheap metal. When mine arrived, it was broke in two places. Not even worth $2."
2.0,Not the length as the image shown on amazon.  Material is very brittle.
2.0,The shade of pink is much lighter than I expected. Sizing is also not great. It’s not as baggy as I wanted it to be. Seems I should have gotten a 3X.
2.0,Received the right color but dress isn’t anything like picture and size 12 would never fit a girl who wears 11/12 maybe a 7/8. Not sure they sent the product I ordered but this has definitely got to be returned. Glad I planned ahead for Christmas.
2.0,The item was defective.
2.0,"This dress had weird sizing, as mentioned by other reviewers.  If you're a bit pear-shaped you'll be OK.  I'm 5'7&#34;, 148 lbs, and usually wear a 10.  I'm not particularly busty (36 B or C depending on the bra).  I got the large after reading reviews, and could just button it over my chest!  It was tight, and I'd be afraid of popping a button if I took too deep a breath.  Meanwhile, the hips were a bit big--at least, they made MY hips look big.  Sent this one back."
2.0,"the sweatshirt itself looked good and the material seemed to be a nice weight.  However, I usually wear a small or medium, and even the Large was too small in the body, and very tight getting my head thru the opening."
2.0,This item is too small for an adult male.  I may pass it on to a ten-year old.  The product seems well made.
2.0,Walet is too slick to stay in pants pocket.
2.0,"The string for the hood came out already. I've worn it 3xs. Very soft and long, comfy though"
2.0,It wasn't the same bracelet that is in the picture! The one I received was pink and white and had a boat anchor instead of love and a saying &#34;where there's a will there's a way&#34; instead of the other love. I decided not to send it back because its a good bracelet for the price just not at all what I wanted. It made a inexpensive gift for someone else.
2.0,Gave to my kid for Christmas didn't come with the charger
2.0,The glasses are great but the lenses are large not sure if they are considered small or the wrong ones were sent.
2.0,"First impressions are lasting and this not a good quality case. The zipper was hard to open and then jammed the first try, then the zipper split altogether.Low cost sure but spend a couple bucks more rather than waste it here. Just be warned, it's not for daily use."
2.0,Extremely small children size
2.0,This ran a size small.  Was not flattering.  Will be returning.
2.0,Not chiffon material
2.0,"Loved this until I washed it. Washed cold, delicate and hung dry and it shrunk up a ton-I can no longer wear it.<br /><br />So disappointing because it was so cute and flattering!"
2.0,These socks are basically all lint and make a mess. I'll not be repurchasing. They're not even really soft either.
2.0,Looks like plastic and feels very flimsy
2.0,"Ive barely had it a month and I shook it to get some tree dander off of it and the entire bill came apart, appears as if it was glued on and not sewn together."
2.0,So this fit good up top (even though I am busty 38G)  but did not fit over my hips (ordered the XXL) .  It's bright color but the material is cheap and see through...like something a wind sock or a  cheap flag would be made out of... it would be good for pictures or 1x wear for a Cinco De Mayo party or something casual but the quality and fit is not good (I get it it's cheap).  Wish I could find a soft cotton or even linen style authentic dress like this with true embroidery and vividness of this dress.  Returning.
2.0,came unbuckled too many times. lost it. gone. crappy buckle.
2.0,Wrinkles too easily has to be ironed
2.0,much bigger than posted
2.0,"Packed badly. The hood was crammed into the mailing box, not even in plastic. The fur is a mess. One of the paw pads is not completely glued down. Of course it did not come with batteries. Since it takes a 9 volt, I will have to go buy batteries before I can even check to see if the lights even work. Bit of a disappointment."
2.0,I purchased these for a friend in Hawaii and they are too large. We wish to return them but I have not received a return authorization number or actually any reply. Would appreciate some assistance.
2.0,Bought the xl and it was super tight. This item runs small.
2.0,"Not a fan of the back when it's on... it's cute in the picture but doesn't lay right in real life. Plus the skirt is not as long as the picture makes it out to be, it's still a standard suit the skirt doesn't cover long enough."
2.0,Material is thin and see through
2.0,"I wish it had noted that it is made of carboard.  It is REALLY overpriced for what it is.  No hangers,trunk is well made, just not worth 99.00"
2.0,"Not sure if my boyfriend just has a big head or not, but about the 3rd time he wore them they broke."
2.0,These picture holders didn't fit in he wallet I purcased
2.0,"To me, the pin looks like a relief pin, but, is completely flat, which got me disappointed. Might be a self persection. Looks like got material."
2.0,"This does not get very cold even in the freezer, and does not stay cool very long.  The Frogg Toggs work much better, I just<br />have to figure out how to shape them like this and put velcro on them."
2.0,Not true to size.  Runs small.
2.0,"I love the &#34;theory&#34; behind these pants... high waist, vibrant color... for office or play.. HOWEVER... it was smaller than expected.  The belt should have been larger as well... it barely made a small bow. AND MOST IMPORTANT... the material is a very thin, stretchy, polyester ish type spandex something... wasn't very flattering.. and super wrinkly... not sure how well it would &#34;iron&#34; given the synthetic material."
2.0,I’ve bought these exact earrings before and they lasted forever (3+ years) with no problems but on my recent order one of the earrings came off its post within a week of wearing it (leaving me with a post stuck in my ear trying to pry it out with a small metal bit in front but nothing to grab on to). Pretty disappointed.
2.0,I was so disappointed.Cute but very cheaply made. Love the disign and colors.
2.0,"Legs cut for Sagging. Pulled up, a bit short in length."
2.0,Material feels decent but the inside “compression” liner is just way too long.
2.0,It’s Beautiful But It Changed Color Quicker Than Shipping
2.0,"Even on my tippy toes, it was dragging on the floor- easily a FOOT too long, despite me being nearly 5'7""!!! The colors are also far more bright than the picture depicts and the top had a weird, baggy fit.  An awful shame, since I was hoping to order 2-3 more colors! Returned it the same day!"
2.0,Very big size and very very bad quality cheap
2.0,The break apart after a few weeks.
2.0,"i like the mask, its just not good when im expecting 3 pack but only receive 1"
2.0,"Fabric and cut makes this a great summer dress but the print is wacky. Size small for a 5'2, 117lb person is too big."
2.0,Size i ordered seems smaller then other brands
2.0,If you have thighs these will just roll down. You'll need a garter belt or to be built like a child.
2.0,This scarf doesn't have the color white in it. The quality of the scarf does not justify the price.
2.0,Broke before I even wore it out to my Halloween party. Luckily it was very easy to super glue back together.
2.0,"I’m 5’4 160lbs and the M was waaay too big. Waaay longer than pictured too. But hey, it was $10. And free returns."
2.0,Ordered an XL.  Couldn't even get my arms in it.  Wanted to wear it so badly.  so pretty but very very small.  i'm usually a size 12
2.0,Its more like a plastic material.  Was disappointed
2.0,"Update: 5 wears later and I notice that one of the &#34;diamonds&#34; has fallen out:-(<br /><br />I ordered another one...I'll let you know what happens with this one....<br /><br />This is a perfect fit for my tragus! I don't need to heal another piercing to get the look I want!<br /><br />This is tiny....but tiny is exactly what you need. Careful squishing and you can adjust the size for your ear.<br /><br />I bpught and returned another ring like this that was $1 less and TOTAL cr#p.<br /><br />This appears to be a very nice piece of jewelry!??! for less than $10?!!!? oh, and it came in 3 days!"
2.0,Love the bag but so disappointed in the quality or the seller---not sure who ruined the bag.  I bought the bag a month ago but just started using it.  Yesterday I  noticed a giant x pattern cut into the back of the bag.  You don't notice the slits until there are items in the bag which now I am outside of the return window.  Extremely disappointed at this point.  Looks like someone went at it with a box cutter.
2.0,Runs small. Not a professional look- looks cheap. Liked the lining but not the jacket material. Purchased the blazer in two different colos (black & white). Returned both.
2.0,These are not sweatpants. More like a track pant material. Waited for these for over a month due to the COVID hitting at the same time I placed an order only to get them and they are this weird slick material. Nothing like the sweat pants I was expecting plus the pockets are in a weird spot in relation to the waist band.
2.0,One of the earring prints were darker than the other... The thought is cute though...
2.0,It fits small. The colors are very dirty looking.
2.0,The display is no where bright enough.
2.0,"Pants are cute but, they are loose in the waist, snug in the thighs and way too long. I’m 5’7” and they were at least 3” too long with shoes on. Model in the pic must be 6 feet tall. LOL"
2.0,"Not as advertised, color good."
2.0,"It is very short, and I am 5'3. Also at the top it is too wide. Not satisfied."
2.0,They look great. Except I live in San Diego so the thermal lining is totally unnecessary.
2.0,Returned. Cheap feel of material
2.0,It was to baggy and short
2.0,This item did nothing for me at all so if you are heavy up top then don’t bother
2.0,Great Looks but came way to big
2.0,"I think the necklace was beautiful, but I only got to wear it twice before it broke unfortunately."
2.0,Not soft and hard to get on
2.0,That it changed color and it broke
2.0,"it's a cute outfit. I bought 3-6 month size. My son is currently is 3 month clothes, some 0-3 sizes. The outfit shirt fits ok right now, the sleeves are long- expected since it's for 3-6 months, however the pants are pretty tight around the waist."
2.0,Leggings started peeling the very first time I wore them :(
2.0,I had purchased the pink lens .. because from the picture they had looked REALLY cute. I was excited to have received them in the mail.. but what made me very upset about the product is that the mirror lens were not pink .. more like a gold color. Returned and got my money back .
2.0,I got the large size and it is to tight. I could barely move my knees. Not recommended for an adult.
2.0,"They were missing a rhinestone when they came out of the package. It wasn't super noticeable while wearing them, but up close you could tell."
2.0,Doesn’t look the same at all
2.0,"I love the way this watch band looks and I absolutely loved it for a week! One day I looked down and one of the straps had popped off the slide that attches to the base. Broken completely. My watch was just laying in between the car seat, I'm so glad I didn't lose it! If you wear this out then change it out, I think it would be great but it's not an everyday wear band!"
2.0,Had for like a week and broke. Took off  and put back on to wash hands every time I washed them.
2.0,Good quality cap but unfortunately thin cheap quality iron on logo … :(
2.0,"The only way this scarf will wrap around your body anywhere close to what's shown in the picture, is &#34;if&#34; yu are a size &#34;0&#34;.  A waste for money for me."
2.0,Cute online. Not cute in person. Cheap materials used.
2.0,"i loveed these and wore them everyday (never got them wet) until they started giving my ear holes infections, then i was no longer able to wear them.  it is cheap metal and sadly my skin couldnt handle it.  I wish they were better quality but i guess i got my moneys worth out of them."
2.0,"Although a good shoe, the lights short out within DAYS for wearing. My 2 yr old was heartbroken and couldn't understand why his shoes would not light up or charge anymore."
2.0,"I loved this jacket when I received it.  I wore it once.  Since it was white, it needed washing.  After the first wash, I noticed a dark line running right in the middle across half of the front of the jacket.  It is very noticeable.  Also, the jacket started pilling up almost immediately."
2.0,Not worth the $$$<br />Too small
2.0,Didn't come with the 5 silicone keychains.
2.0,I have worn a lot of shapes and waist trainers and this one sadly did not work out for me. I like bodycon dresses and you can see the zipper and the seems around the booty. Also makes the booty look weird. I was disappointed.
2.0,Pretty to look at in the picture- but def not true sized- go up AT LEAST one size; Now to figure out how to return them.....
2.0,"It's pretty, but it's cheap- The chain broke within the first few hours of my wearing it. I'm returning it."
2.0,"the listing indicates that they are created in the United States of 100% cotton. I couldn't confirm that because the labels didn't indicate so. The cloth does not appear to be cotton. They have a synthetic gloss to them, and the straps are stretchy. Cotton might be used for the white lining. I looked for the Higher Standards brand on the internet, but all I discovered was a supplier of smoking accessories. Each mask is individually wrapped in plastic. The logos do not appear as vivid to me as they do in the photographs. Workmanship looks to be excellent. If you require a huge mask, you may be willing to pay the extra expense."
2.0,"I was very dissapointed. I had bought this for my mom as a last minute gift, and it looked like if i had bought it a the .99¢ Store. Not worth the money."
2.0,Very nice blouse. But I was unstitched to reach a strip.
2.0,Velcro strap broke on sneakers two weeks after my daughter wore them.
2.0,Love the sneaker but I had to give them 3 stars because they run too big. Label said 8.5 but they were more like a 9. Shoebacca is  aware of the problem and does not seem to care.
2.0,These are very tiny!!! About 2 inches smaller than my normal thongs. They are high waisted and feel like good quality but need to change the sizing. I got the xl/xxl and they are more like the m/l. Very disappointing since brands virtually dont make high waist thongs
2.0,"Ordered the large which should fit kids ages 8-10. They were too small. I wound up giving them away to a few friends who had younger kids ages 3-5. They were either sized wrong, or they put the wrong size in the package."
2.0,It wasn’t what I expected and it kept falling off of my waist which made them super uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,Bottoms made small
2.0,"for the price I was expecting something a little nicer the earrings I received had one  broken upon receiving them, it was an easy fix for me since I usually make my own earring and have the tools handy to do so, but I wouldn't suggest gifting these to anyone unless you  want to seem like you spent 5 dollars on something you spent 20 on."
2.0,Really small and thin fabric
2.0,It's not a true fit. My husband wears a large. We bought an 2x and it's a very snug fit. The material is very thin.
2.0,"Pants were HUGE and top was SMALL. I didn't send back because as it worked out I kept the very baggy bottoms because I like sleeping in loose garments. I gave the shirt away and all worked out. I would not recommend it though.since most people would send it back. I just love Minions and it was a gift from my grandson. As for the top, it did fit, but I wear a l/xl usually, but request this size because of size chart running small. The pants fit both my hubby and I together. We did it for the kids as a joke."
2.0,Super cute shirt but the color pink I received was not the same cor as I ordered.
2.0,It's too long for small wrists
2.0,"If it was the color shown I probably would have forgiven it being so oddly shaped and snug for the sizing. Granted, I'm chubby but there are a lot of shirts that still are fitted right and look decent on me and this didn't. The fabric is soft, but not like a tshirt material. It's more of spandex/polyester sort of feel to it. The price makes it cute for the holiday, but I felt it looked so bad on me that I returned it."
2.0,Runs small. Material looks and feels inexpensive.
2.0,Iron on logo the o my reason I gave this two stars is because they refunded me the money and let me keep the hat.
2.0,Loved the design but unfortunately they run small and shallow so no dice.
2.0,"Cute and Soft..BUT they run SUPER small ! I ordered 2 sizes up from my normal size for comfort, the waist band was 18"" for an XL .the rest of the short was wide legged very un Natural measurements.."
2.0,"The material is just like Tights. It snags and runs like Tights. Pretty see though. They are comfortable and cute, but an awkward material to be used for an athletic type piece of clothing. Not what I expected."
2.0,They looked tacky and one of the jewels had fallen off prior to opening the package. Wouldn't recommend for an event. It's more like costume jewelry.
2.0,"I ordered the black stainless steel band, and loved it the moment it arrived.  It looks nice, way better than those silicone bands and no more irritation.<br /><br />The link removing tool they send as well is a big bonus.<br /><br />1 week into owning it and disappointment sets in...  The black on the watch band is already starting to rub off on over half of the band.  It is at all the contact points where your watch band touches when you put your arm down on something.  Fitbits are made to be worn 24/7, so a band that cannot keep up in appearance for more than 1 week is kind of a let down.  I don't have a physically demanding job that would account for extra wear and tear on it either."
2.0,I sad my floating pearls didn’t float
2.0,Way too small for an adult head
2.0,Not a scull cap. Much larger than appears in photo.
2.0,Be careful! these are an off brand sock with a yellow toe.  They are not GOLD Toe  brand socks.
2.0,ordered an XL and fits but it is not cut for anyone with curves gave it to a friend and looks great on her
2.0,Didn’t stay pretty for long.  Buyer beware
2.0,Arms are too small
2.0,I thought it would have been more orange than pink
2.0,"A cool watch, but it came with no instructions AND after only one month of wear, the wristband is cracking. :(<br />I would not consider buying this product again."
2.0,This was not what I expected.  It thought it would be bigger since it is advertised as a beach bag.  The material had an annoying odor.  It was a gift and I was very disappointed.
2.0,"Good color, well constructed, but did not fit over my glasses and did not block all of the light from top, bottom and sides."
2.0,"Runs 2 sizes too small, very very narrow band can barely see the prints"
2.0,"Arrived damaged. Luckily it is for a children’s Halloween costume, so I can still make it work. Wish there was a way to go into a solid light on mode not just sound and motion (jostling like when jogging) only light up mode, but it will work for what I need."
2.0,"Sizes are true, style is as advertised, but the finish is way off from the picture. There is no luster to the metallic ones. They just look like flat plain colors with absolutely no shine. Basically just interestingly colored rubber bands."
2.0,Nice hat but it is very small.  One gust of wind and it would be gone!!!  Good for a child.
2.0,Purchased for my teen and these are better suited to my 2 yr old niece. Not one size fits all.
2.0,I got the snake print it fit small more for bbl type body I’m curvy but this was not what I expected it’s a 2 piece as well the material when stretches looses it’s pattern color. Returned immediately not worth the price at all. Not as pictured.
2.0,I am really not happy at all with my purchase because I specifically sent an email to verify that I was getting the right size and they told me that it would fit. However when I received the package did it not fit but the clasps which are really not clasps at all really didn't connect together at my waist.Then they send me a 4xl thong just because you are big at the top does not mean that you are big at the bottom. I had to pay $9.99 to have it sent t me and I have top pay shipping and handling to send it back and I will also be accessed a 20% restocking fee.
2.0,My two year old son loves these shoes I have grey and black
2.0,"I think I should have gotten a size down. I like my shirts really snug. I am 5'9 and 145lbs and got a an Asian large. I thought it would be much slimmer. I also don't like the look and feel of the material, it doesn't look professional to me."
2.0,"I bought this with the highest hopes, but was rather disappointed when I opened the package only to find the front scratched and the hoop (that connects to a necklace) bent at about 45 degrees. Luckily (or maybe not so luckily) the metal is VERY pliable, so I was able to bend it to its correct setting. I don't think I'll be wearing it as often as I had hoped."
2.0,Broke on the first day of use on an indoors water park
2.0,Liked them but they lasted less than 2 months before the screw holding the ear piece came off
2.0,The teeth slip and don’t grip fabric well enough to keep the bra tight. Also the teeth leave dark marks on your bra.
2.0,I like the watch.<br />The band was described as nylon and I assumed it was all nylon.<br />I am disappointed at the leather tabs on the end but I can live with it.
2.0,"Broke, top screw came out, and now it shuts crookedly, its missing a spring."
2.0,"These look fantastic. But, they are too thick/ inflexible at the knotted area that they don't actually work with my shirts. Essentially they don't go into the button hole. I wear normal sized shirts that are made in the US and I've tried this with a few brands. Success rate is small ;)."
2.0,"I ordered this for my Miami trip and it was just awful, I got a size small and it was way to big and didn’t hug me at all. May work for females who have a larger chest."
2.0,"Way too short! Dissapointing.  I love the colors, but the length defeats the purpose of a blanket scarf."
2.0,Just too big and too hard a lump. Forces you to walk off balance.
2.0,"It was way too small, very cute but too small."
2.0,The necklaces began to stretch out within a week of wearing.
2.0,The material of the shirt is nice however the size of what I ordered and what I received didn't match up. The shirt feels about 2 sizes too small compared to what I ordered so I wonder if the sizing on the shirt is based on some other country (shirts in Asia I usually have to get 2-3 sizes larger) so maybe this is what the problem is. Returning it was simple enough.
2.0,"Really disappointed with this one. I've seen this on a few websites, and was really excited to actually decide to buy it.<br />The fabric is awful, thin, and feels like taffeta. The lace is a decent fabric, so that was a plus, but the straps, as well as the lacing down the deep v is a very cheap feeling and cheap looking string.<br />It was slightly small for me, but still within the sizing expectations.<br />I think this would look really good on a short petite girl or a very skinny tall girl. I am 5'11 and typically wear either a medium or large. This top I ordered a large."
2.0,Disappointed when I received this. Looks cheap. Won't be wearing it in the salon
2.0,Material was really cheap and the fit was just off...too much cleavage and underarm skin to even wear a strapless bra. Returned.
2.0,"Cute! Very short.  I’m 5’10” and normally wear size 8/10 M.  I really wasn’t expecting much but the dress was too cute not to try especially for the $10 price.  Unfortunately, it was way too short —approximately skimmed me mid thigh and had to be returned right away.  Also, the fabric is very thin so don’t expect to get multiple wears out of it."
2.0,No duro ni una semana se despegó
2.0,"I found this to be very poor quality. Did not come put together, and the necklace looked very cheap. For the price, it was not worth it!"
2.0,"I bought 2 dresses in different colors because I couldn't decided. I'm 120 lbs and 5'6 so the dresses both fit perfectly, where it looked flattering but still had space for you to breathe/dance. The sleeves on one of the dresses seemed to be outstretched or defective because the material kept flaring out of the armpit area, making the dress seem big. So, I ended up picking the one that didn't look weird. If I had extra time, to find a different dress for my friend's wedding, I would've passed on this dress. It's cute but not worth the price."
2.0,"The swimsuit came within 1 week of ordering.<br /><br />I love the print and it looks like the photo; however, I am returning for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) I ordered a large as the description notes that the sizes are Asian so consumers should go 1 size up. The breast area is too large and spacey.<br />2) I am 5'7&#34; and the length of the bathing suit is okay, but feels a bit tight in the crotch area.<br />3) There are strings hanging off the bathing suit where the stitching ends. These can be cut, but it makes the garment look cheap and rushed."
2.0,Def runs small and the images are plastic. It’s def going to crack plus make her sweat in the summer.  Only plus is it wipes off easily. Ariel shirts are hard to find.
2.0,Ok glasses for the price. Uncomfortable after long bike rides. Fog easy. But around 20 dollars. Get what you pay for...
2.0,Had to return this item because the halter and band were not flattering.
2.0,"I ordered two of these for my husband and myself for camping, canoeing, and river tubing beverages -- based on the reviews that said they do not leak.<br /><br />Well.  One leaks.  The other does not.  Don't know why, they look exactly the same.  I'm just cursed."
2.0,"These are very cheaply made. They're cute, but don't expect to be able to move them around without breaking the gem off and leaving the jibbit stuck in your croc."
2.0,"This dress looks and feels cheap. The the sewing is off, it's bunched together in some spots. The color blocks are not aligned on the sides. I'll be returning this dress."
2.0,"The shirt is super soft which I like. But, the fabric did shrink in the wash, and is that slinky material that sticks to your body. I would recommend going up an extra size. I got a size xl and I am 5’6” at 230lbs."
2.0,Discolored very fast. It seemed very cute but within a week it started to discolor.
2.0,I ordered according to the size chart. I would say that it was size as a mens not womens. I fit my husband and he did not want the sweatshirt. I had to pay another $8.00 to return it. Disappointed
2.0,"Runs small,  design is see-thru"
2.0,"Yes, it is cute, but the smell was bad, the belt is not too stretchy."
2.0,These pants do not stretch. The fit is tight.
2.0,Not flattering if your 5'3. Good material though
2.0,wrong colour came
2.0,"Poor quality... I bought 5 different colors, and they all have fraying threads after only one time wearing them. Not good for busty women, and I definitely wish they were a tad longer. Can't breastfeed comfortably in public, doesn't allow for coverage for someone who's a 38H."
2.0,"A glass of liquid accidentally spilled on my me and they barely got wet. A few minutes later the fabric on 2 of the skinny ones came unglued and unraveled.<br />One of the thick one's broke while it was on my wrist cutting me. Needless to say, I ended up throwing away 3 of them from the set...I'm  not happy 😡"
2.0,Too snug in the middle
2.0,I ordered large. and it was still way too small. It's really pretty though!
2.0,"I wanted for the skid proof sole. Unfortunately, it falls in the arch of my foot."
2.0,Completely see-through. And the slits are so high that its almost impossible to wear anything underneath.
2.0,"Item sent was not at all like the picture. It’s the right size and feels super soft, but it’s more of a sweatsuit than pajamas.This item was cheap enough that it’s not worth the hassle of returning, but it’s definitely not like the picture."
2.0,Very affordable so I kept<br />I get the idea of the foldable or packable hat but then they look nothing like the Panama style hat in the photo and not sure they will ever go back to that shape<br />Not to mention they were covered in hot glue “strings” I guess from where the band was attached
2.0,Looked much warmer.  Very thin and tight.
2.0,"This is not worth the price. If I saw this in a store the most I would pay is $3, because you can basically get this at your local beauty supply store at least I can. The width you see in the photo is the actual width and this is pretty thin. I am returning"
2.0,the size chart is way off.  Its about a two size difference
2.0,XL was too small for my 130 pound 5'9 daughter! ridiculous !
2.0,"This romper ran small, I was told it looked like I had a bathing suit on. So I just decide to only wear it to the beach. I had other plans for this romper. One  thing I really didn't like was the material was one-sided and white on the inner. I try and not buy anything that isn't consistently  the same on both sides."
2.0,i love big but this is way too big! i still kept it though LOL... maybe one day i'll be brave enough to wear it without feeling like a bumblebee LOL
2.0,Chain broke on first day wearing it.  The letter is small and has no shimmer/sparkle.  Stones dull looking.
2.0,"Cute idea but cheaply executed. Love the idea of the socks but unfortunately they are short of mediocre. They are low quality and could ha a been purchased at a dollar store.  They are t bbn in and not at all soft and very lackluster in person.  The sign is kind of a joke, its size of small lisence plate and I'm not sure where you are supposed to put it.  No way worth $15!!!!! I wouldnt pay more than $5 for the socks. Dont waist your money...just buy the person a book!"
2.0,"Not squat proof, see through<br /><br />Unfortunately the pink pants are see through and the fabric accentuates any cellulite you may have. I really love the design so I’m disappointed because the tag and my underwear can be seen when I put these on."
2.0,This item was too expensive for how cheap it is. One month later and it’s already significantly discolored and broken. Pretty disappointed honestly. Also it’s very difficult to put on once you take it off. I often needed someone to help me. Wouldn’t purchase again.
2.0,The elastic in the waste. Worst thing ever.  Also the top is shorter than shown in the picture.  Bought 2 pairs and had to give them both away.
2.0,Cute outfit but socks keep rolling down and wings broke first time tried to put them on. Would not recommend.
2.0,Runs small but looks good
2.0,"Because this mask has an exhale valve, it does not protect others around you if you wear it for COVID protection, and is outlawed in many cities/schools/hospitals.  In other words, you are getting filtered air in, but you are breathing out without a filter.  Look for other options that protect your community as well as yourself -- we're all in this together!"
2.0,"This rain jacket is super cute, my toddler even stood in front of the mirror rawring. HOWEVER, this product smells so bad. I have washed it and hung it in my laundry room to dry and it still stinks. I can't even go in my laundry room that's how bad it is. If anyone has a secret to getting the smell out... PLEASE HELP!"
2.0,for the price they were ok.  But I doubt if I would buy them a second time for my nieces.
2.0,Disappointed in the material and it was too tight in the arms.
2.0,"Purchased for a work gift exchange.  While the pin is lovely, it  packaged so poorly that two of the pearlized stones were loose in the package.  Tried gluing them back on myself.  Won't order from this seller again."
2.0,"Needs serious ironing to look acceptable. Left it in the hotel in Paris. Bought to wear on a barge trip, but it just didn't work."
2.0,Terrible fit material is not totally cheap but not great.
2.0,Material is good but the dress runs very small. Buttons on bottom half sag and it is u flattering. Would not buy again.
2.0,I mean I loved it. Until we noticed it turning my neck black...
2.0,"This is a Vinyl Purse, NOT Leather, as stated in some of the reviews. It is also almost a &#34;brick&#34; red, not as bright as the picture indicates. Definitely a &#34;Fall&#34; season purse.  I miss the signature D & B  braided zipper pull to and should have splurged on a leather Tote instead. This inside is a cheesy red vinyl, not an attractive color, instead of D & B's signature red fabric."
2.0,So I got bracelets instead of the scarf so a little confused but my cousin liked it anyways so Ig it’s ok this time
2.0,"Disappointed. I rolled the dice on these that they'd fit my size 15 feet, they did not.<br /><br />Very comfortable socks, and well padded, just they are too small for me.<br /><br />However, my wife wears as a 12.5 in men's, and she loves them. So there's that."
2.0,The pins were extremely flimsy and the bracelets were no more than rubber bands. Both much smaller and thinner than they look in the pictures.
2.0,Looks like a misspelling in the last sentence. Be aware before purchasing
2.0,Really short and really see through. It will only work as a bathing suit cover up.
2.0,doesn't stay on
2.0,At first I loved this purse. Such a cute design and I love the colors. Haven’t had it very long and the zipper won’t stay shut. Very disappointed 😞
2.0,"Great quality, runs small. Didn’t fit"
2.0,Beautiful bead but it is a very pale pink not the darker pink that is pictured.
2.0,"Didn’t look like the picture , cheap material"
2.0,Feels cheap and light weight
2.0,These socks are so ridiculously thin in one week over 5 pairs have holes under the heel and 2 pairs got holes simply from removing the tags.
2.0,Fit is baggy and the belt is a joke.  Just throw it away...  It won't stay tight.
2.0,The size chart stated that a 3X would fit sizes 22-24 but when I received the sweaters the 3X size was for 24-26
2.0,The material was a little flimsy
2.0,"The product doesn't stay in place whether I use it while riding my motorcycle, out in the yard or just around house. It continuously rolls up and I o didn't like any of the patterns in the pack."
2.0,Cheap material. Not leather.
2.0,"Not happy with this dress, it is baggy.  I ordered a medium and it loose.. I am curvy."
2.0,Cute hat but way too small for my head. I had read reviews that said it was too big so I had hopes. Nope and now I’m stuck with this one.
2.0,Fell apart when I wore
2.0,"The fit on this was fine, but I found the material too plastic-y for my taste. Also the sleeves weren't long enough for me."
2.0,"It's such a pretty watch but a lot smaller then expacted, but very nice looking watch though.."
2.0,"Very snug, stretchy thin fabric. Seems cheap. Not what I was expecting."
2.0,Well did you was good but the pink was red and dark purpleWhat is blue
2.0,Cute shirt but I should've gotten a medium. I'm 5'8 150lbs and the large bunched around the waist area too much.
2.0,The spacer is nice. I only received one and just now having the time to mention it die to my duties a hospital during Dorian.
2.0,Much thinner than normal hoodie.
2.0,"Cheap feel to them  - I bought 2 pairs, different colours - and lots of loose threads inside. Wouldn't recommend for every day wear."
2.0,The Material has changed. It's rough to the touch. Your old ones were better
2.0,This was not what I expected. I is the first time that I did not like the product. The picture of it was deceptive.
2.0,So unflattering and the material felt like something a flag is made out of. Cheap clothes from China. Ordered it for a nice summer work staple...returning it ASAP
2.0,Waaaayyyy to much money for what you get. These are flimsy and cheap looking.
2.0,"I purchased this bra online because it is impossible to find my bra size in the stores. That being said the cup size was spot on, but the band size was more of a 40-42 than the advertised 44. The side support on this bra was non-existent. There is also an extra bit of fabric in the seam across the front of the cup that makes for an unfortunate lump in the middle of the cup. So for these reasons I will be returning the bra and would not recommend this bra."
2.0,I really liked the colors. The jersey just too big. I returned it but did by two more in a medium. Not the same color. They fit great<br />Update: 2/17/21-I love the two I brought in a medium. Fits well and feels great. The padding do feel a little bulky but it should flatten out with wear. Will give it 4.5 🌟
2.0,"Style was nice.  However, there was no stretch to the material.  I normally wear a medium and ordered a large which I could not even get my arms into the inside.  very very small."
2.0,The dress arrived and it had a hole in the from waist band and missing stiches..Like the color but. VERY poorly made...I NEED A REFUND ASAP..Order a black one last year and it was perfect different company..size runs small this is a 2x that looks like a large....Very dissatisfied with this dress....
2.0,Ummm... this is not a full box. The first 5 rows are completely missing.
2.0,Yarn was not soft as would be expected for a newborn.
2.0,I even ordered up a bit and can't even fasten the hooks
2.0,Yeah sure they’re really pretty. Too bad the posts are too fat to fit in my ears.
2.0,"Cute hat, but it is definitely way too big for a toddler - more like an adult size than toddler/youth."
2.0,"Dont buy this if you plan on using it in a health related field, the material is absorbent and thin"
2.0,"I guess I shouldn't be surprised given the price of the glasses, but was expecting more since the brand itself has a decent following. The biggest issues I have with these are the cheap/lightweight feel and the glare/reflection on the INSIDE of the glasses. When you're wearing them, you can see a reflection of your own eye in the lenses, and it becomes extremely distracting and annoying -- especially while driving.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- looks good (from afar)<br />- unique<br /><br />Cons:<br />- little protection for your eyes -- find myself squinting even with them on because it's still bright (no, I'm not like Trump and looking directly into the sun)<br />- glare/reflection mentioned above that is on the inside of the lenses and distracts from your view<br />- cheap and lightweight feel to them"
2.0,These shorts are very thin and see through.
2.0,These don't even look like pearls. It looks like a shiny white ball glued to a tunnel.
2.0,Very cheap feeling and looking... waste of money.
2.0,Cheap and fade quickly. You get what you pay for. They are disposable like many other cheap and similar jewelry items on Amazon. I usually wear them once for an event and toss.
2.0,very poor quality material and cheaply made. Fits larger than expected.
2.0,I purchased a large and it's like an extra small. Very disappointed and will be returning it.
2.0,They are too small and too short and too thin. Not a good hiking sock
2.0,I love the personalization but the ring seems to be pretty cheap for the price!
2.0,"The shirt is nice and soft as advertised, however it runs horrifically small. I usually wear an XL and wanted a loose comfy shirt to relax in so I ordered the xxl. It was like trying to put a 300lb man into a kids t shirt. Holy cow I didn’t expect this to be so tight. Only gave 2 stars because it’s soft and made well. But whatever the t shirt company states for their sizes, go up at least 2-3 sizes."
2.0,"This skirt was way more poofy than shown in the pictures. I had to return it. I looked like a cupcake. The waistband was too small, as well."
2.0,"These<br /><br />The quality is fine and a great value for the price if they fit. Beware, they run very large in size."
2.0,"The chest was way to small, and the dress was extremely long! I mean for the price it was ok."
2.0,Fabric is like a wetsuit for diving!  Not at all what I expected.
2.0,It looks cute in the photo but beware very cheaply made. I got gold and it faded on day 2 can no longer wear i know you get what you pay for but still very disapointed.
2.0,would have been great if it cam in a size smaller. Very nice quality and looks nice on a bigger woman.
2.0,The red  is a rust color instead which did not go with my red coat.
2.0,"This shirt is made with a nylon type fabric, so it's very light and feels ""satiny"".  The only tag is a size tag, so there's no laundry care instructions or what this shirt is made of.  While the sizes include chest size in inches, these are not accurate.  Also I was disappointed in the graphics on the shirt.  No complete flamingos, and lots of melons -- the pictured example was cute and whimsical.  The actual shirt not so much.  I'll keep the shirt but  probably wouldn't order more."
2.0,"My girlfriend bought this purse and loved the size and look of it. Unfortunately, when wearing white shirts, the purse strap would badly stain the shirt."
2.0,"Thin material , but good for summer RUNS VERY SMALL"
2.0,This is a really nice watch but it didn't work when i received it. I bought it as a Christmas gift for hubby and was totally disappointed. Spent over $60 us on it. It makes no sense returning because i live in Trinidad and will be charged by the carrier to return the item. I intend to have it checked out at the watch repair shop. I will update this review if it works. Otherwise I will have to count my losses. Total shame.
2.0,Wasn't what I was expecting. A lot smaller and the material not good.
2.0,"I have always worn shoes for crews, This is my fifth pair. I've always been able to wear the right out of the box, no breaking in needed, Ive been wearing the Madison III for the last 6 months. I ordered the Kora but they run smaller than the Madison. They also rub my toes causing a blister. These are NOT GOOD work shoes."
2.0,This item was entirely too small… I wear a large or xl as I have a large chest however this fit like a small!!
2.0,"Not good quality. I bought two, only wore one and didn't even try to wear the other one. Did not like them at all."
2.0,"OK so I purchased this bathing suit in hopes it would fit me. I read the reviews and said to order a size up so having a larger chest I ordered 3 sizes larger that I wear, and as you can guess it was still way too small! The bottoms were so small it made my tummy look like a busted can of biscuits and the top I hung out all the way around.  If you wear a size large you would need at least a 4 to 5xl. I personally won't purchase ever again!"
2.0,wrong color but close enough.... also i like these frames because i thought that the arms popped off and on easily.. these are knock offs so theyre screwed on /:
2.0,Not a very good fabric. The dress sizes fit as they are recorded but it was not soft or flowy at all.
2.0,Very uncomfortable for an undershirt tank top.  Just buy Hanes or fruit of the loom.  Cloth is a lot better though.  Just uncomfortable
2.0,"Nice looking, but a little too thin and short for office wear."
2.0,They fit weird. They looked crooked when I put them on. Who knows maybe it’s my face but not for me.
2.0,It's very hard to get my daughter foot in. Would be better with a zipper on the side. Cute prints.
2.0,"They were too small. Unfortunately, I'll have to return them."
2.0,"Welll the quality is what I expected based on previous reviews, but it sits a bit funky on my body. They also sent pink instead of brown, but I’d changed my mind on the color anyway. Still, it was definitely not brown and if it was supposed to be, I’m concerned"
2.0,The pockets on this dress stuck out and made me look like I had wings. I really wanted to like this dress but I just couldn’t because I felt like I Was ready to fly away and who wants their hips to look bigger than they already are?
2.0,"I'm a pear shape and this made me look even more like a pear shape. It balloons out at the hips and was a little large for a medium. It was also shorter than I expected, ending about 3-4 inches above the ankle (I'm 5'5""). I gave it away."
2.0,To light for the watch face had too many links
2.0,"This is a good looking watch that gets looks and lots of comments. Despite daily use and kept wound, it is very bad a at keeping accurate time. Time loss is almost four (4) minutes a day!!!!  Not acceptable!!!!  As a longtime Seiko owner, I would expect better. Seiko quality is not evident in this watch. This watch most likely will be returned or returned for service under warranty. Not something one should have to do!  If watch accuracy is important to you, stay away from purchasing this Seiko model/type. My advise, look elsewhere!!!!!"
2.0,I have been using these every day for two months. Half the time I cannot tell if they are even on. The remote does not always turn both insoles on if it turns them on at all. I have had to re-sync the remote numerous times and even when i manually turn each one on it either turns off within a short time or the batteries are just junk.
2.0,"I bought this hat on a whim thinking it would be cool in a retro sort of way. I like the color scheme of the hat, but the fit and quality are not great. The top of the hat is too big and sits awkwardly on my head. The material is also flimsy and not really the best quality."
2.0,Two sizes too big.
2.0,Did not like material at all
2.0,"They're supposed to be anti-fog but, they fogged.."
2.0,Made cheap not even stitching
2.0,"The size is at least two size smaller, it is not a US 14 at all, very disappointed because it is true to it's color and the fabric is very nice too."
2.0,Returned. Colors on item sent were not what was pictured and pattern was very blurry. It did fit well.
2.0,They don’t stay up as well as I would like.
2.0,"I gave these sandals two stars because they are very pretty. However, there was a few problems with them. First, they came in a bag rather than a shoebox. They looked squashed. I don’t have wide feet, but these sandals were so narrow that my feet hung off the sides. You can also see that the straps were rather loose. You can see how the straps have that squashed look to them. Lastly, you can see in the second photo that the surface was scraped off the back edge of the sandal."
2.0,Fabric was cheap & not big enough. Wanted it for an xmas gift but returned it instead.
2.0,"These were labeled as being for men or women, but they’re BIG. In fact, I double checked to see they if they’re meant to be worn over regular glasses. They’re not. Because of the size, I think they’re best suited for men, but as others have noted, the sides have a delicate, unmanly design on them.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is how flimsy and cheap they feel. Given that sunglasses can take a beating in the summer, I don’t think these will last long. The soft case really offers protection only against scratches.<br /><br />My husband really dislikes the style so, unless a friend wants them, it looks like they’ll end up in the charity box."
2.0,Shape was cute and they are very small and dainty but one looked like it was just dipped in glitter in attempts to look like a gemstone.
2.0,Polarized lens was ok but they broke after only a couple uses.
2.0,The earrings are extremely small. Tthe post breaks easily
2.0,"Very small. I always purchase L on Amazon. I could not get this on.  Also very sheer, cheap fabric"
2.0,"I didn’t care for the shape. They appeared to be more round tear drop shaped in the picture, but are actually flat backed."
2.0,second time washing the picture is already coming off of it !
2.0,"ended up ripping it just trying to put it on, was rather cheap looking"
2.0,"I ordered 1/2 size larger..Was very disappointed in that I have just as much foot discomfort,mainly arthritis as I have with my other shoes...Im going to try some Dr Scholls inserts to see if they will help,,,these insoles are SO VERY hard....Do you have any other suggestions,,,these are plenty roomy??"
2.0,Poor quality and smells like rubber.
2.0,"This was a cute little sweater/top in the photo of the product, but unfortunately the quality just wasn't there.  It fit as expected and was cute in it's design, but needed to be made of a better material.<br />The top was sent back for a refund, sorry!  :("
2.0,I ordered a large.. Definitely should of ordered bigger. I'm giving it to my grandaughter.
2.0,Very weak factory
2.0,There's no way the fabric content is accurate. Feels like a cheap rayon or synthetic mix.
2.0,"It’s very cute, but tarnished within a few hours of wearing."
2.0,Run to big and it was TWO  BIG Black STAINS!!
2.0,I love that they are sunflowers but even when I adjust them they are big on my face and it makes them uncomfortable
2.0,They don’t hold the glasses very well and too thick of a string
2.0,"I researched light weight suitcases for an upcoming trip... This suitcase came highly rated....  The odd thing is, I ordered the large suitcase and when it arrived it was obviously a returned smaller suitcase and the return label and note from the last person who returned this item was still in the box.. I called Amazon right away and told them that I received an odd previously returned package and a suitcase that I didn't order, it was way too small....  This was not the item that was advertised on Amazon... Very strange.."
2.0,Runs way too small. I love Spanx but missed the mark on this one.
2.0,Sleeves are super loose for the size. It is cheap looking and not flattering
2.0,After completely charging the battery only one sock worked but it was barely warm on maximum heat setting. The sock did not produce any heat at all.
2.0,VERY VERY THIN MATERIAL  !<br />ON the other hand it could be sexy. But not intended.<br /> Has no ability to absorb any sweat.
2.0,I really wanted to love this sweater but I'd be lying. The black is speckled with multi-colors not the grey I thought it would be. It's not a very soft material... but I'm hoping it might soften with a washing. The tassels are a mess... even a little gross. I'm only 5' so the front goes all the way to my shin. If the wash softens it I will wear it at home as a house sweater otherwise it's going to goodwill.
2.0,Although it is really cute. The way it was folded and the type of material made it hard to get the wrinkles out. I didn’t get to use it in pictures because it was wrinkled. Try rolling it up instead of folding
2.0,The dress was too small.  I
2.0,Lost shape
2.0,Extremely thin and on another app I could have gotten it for $5 the collar also falls funny
2.0,"scratchy, to big and not attractive, more like using a diaper bag than using it as a handbag"
2.0,I'm normally a 1x but this was more like xs.
2.0,Not what I expected for one of the designs. Too big for my face. Hope shrink a bit when I wash them
2.0,Hard to clean once they’re worn a few times. Two year old outgrew them quickly. Not able to consign them due to inability to clean them. They pilled up like a cheap sweater.
2.0,"Shorts are cute and fit well, but they ripped apart THE VERY FIRST TIME I wore them. Do I need to say anything else? Very disappointed."
2.0,Some of the glasses fell apart :-(
2.0,"This band broke on me shortly after the time I could return it, now its unable to be used. If there is a way to get an exchange then I could gladly edit the the review because the band itself is nice if its working."
2.0,Had to return this. The tulle was WAY too poofy for my taste. I felt like a giant cupcake wearing it.
2.0,"I purchased this watch for my girlfriend and within a month of wearing it, the paint around the  rim of the face started coming away. She's careful with it and there's no reason that it should be chipping within a month. I reached out to customer service and aside from an automated response saying someone would get back to me, I received nothing else. No one from the company actually responded and addressed my issues.<br />Additionally, if you have small wrists, this is not a good watch. The smallest hole on the band is still pretty large.<br />I do not recommend this product."
2.0,No son 8 pulseras
2.0,Slippers only lasted a month they started to tear up.
2.0,It's pretty and looks nice on my watch. Clasp comes undone with most movement. Wont be wearing it.  I couldnt stand it anymore after 3 days. Tried to fix it. No luck.
2.0,not sized as expected
2.0,"Fit was good. I'm 6+ months pregnant, but it was not rayon! :( Will be returning!"
2.0,"I have bought used watches before. They can be pretty good value and savings. But when I buy a watch Brand New is because I want “never worn, unused, un-opened” The watch I got is nice but it’s used, not new."
2.0,Very tight in the bust area. Cannot be worn and will be returning.
2.0,It feels exactly like cheap kids costume fabric it was completely see through so you definitely have to layer underneath for warmth and to stay covered
2.0,Save your $8.50. The only reason I didn't give this one star was because it took 5 days before they broke. I bought them for a cheap back-up to keep in my car. Just putting them on and taking them off caused them to split in two different places. Garbage.
2.0,"These gloves are not as advertised at all. The outer layer is good material and the stiches seem to be strong. The problem is the inner lining and the pvc guards on the fingers.<br /><br />The inner lining sticks to your skin meaning if you're not careful the entire sleeve comes out and it's frustratingly difficult to get your fingers back in. You can not simply slide these on at all. Also that lining is not very strong, I've used these for a little over two weeks and already have 3 tears in it meaning they're no longer waterproof.<br /><br />Will they keep your hands pretty safe? Yes. Will you have gloves full of water making it impossible to use your gloves until they dry? Yes. Will the finger guards rip off? Seemingly very easily. Not worth the price at all."
2.0,I really liked that these socks actually did not come off but left my child’s feet red with lots of marks which concerned me.
2.0,"Only 4 from 12 worked.  The ones that work were great, but had to return them."
2.0,"I have a couple waist trainers that are specifically for my waist but thought that this would be a great product for my thighs too. The concept of this product is great, but the reality for me was not good. I have thick thighs and the thigh part barely fit regardless of it being a size 3XL. As a reference point, I wear a sz 14 which would typically be an XL or 1 XL so this really runs small. Also, I have a latex allergy so I was intentional about not finding a product with latex and excited that this one doesn't have it, but fresh out of the pack it had a smell and irritated my skin.  Overall, this might be a good product for someone else, but it was a NO for me because of the small thigh size and the material"
2.0,Very cheap material.  Hard to use.  Don't waste your money.
2.0,"My husband bought these and he has a normal width foot, but they were way too narrow for him. They seemed a little short too. We ended up returning them."
2.0,"I ordered these over a month ago and they finally arrived from China today. Honestly, I don't know what i was thinking. I spend a good bit of time outdoors and am getting ready for a good bit of travel and I guess I thought they'd come in handy.  But the largest one isn't even big enough to use as a laundry bag. An impulse buy that was a complete waste of money. And, as my title says, they stink. I hope they are washable because I cannot be around them while they are off-gassing.  There are the type of cheap products I remember seeing in the stores in Chinatown when I was in San Francisco. Probably water resistant but not waterproof."
2.0,The colors is definitely not as represented. Picture shows a teal blue; the shirt is a primary blue and fabric is somewhat scratchy; wouldn't buy again
2.0,"The charm was made pretty cheaply, and did not seem like it would last long. Not worth the price in my opinion, so I returned it."
2.0,The paint wore off after one wear.
2.0,"I was so excited when i got this ring for Christmas. It WAS beautiful, i could not stop staring at it on my hand. I do agree with other reviews that the picture does not do it justice. So why the 2 star review? I wore this ring 3-4 times since Christmas and when I got home and was taking it off to put it back in its case, I noticed the middle stone had fallen out, I was so pissed. I did nothing that would have caused this stone to fall out...heck, I babied this ring because I thought it was so beautiful, I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Had this chain for 3 weeks and it just snapped in half at the at the clasp. Waste of money I bought the 20in for $30
2.0,"You can see the pockets thru the dress and so heavy at bottom, feels like its pulling you down"
2.0,Loved it. Cheap jewelry.
2.0,"Great cost, however are what you pay for: cheap, stiff material. The knee slits were also not cut right for my height apparently or something, so wouldn't have worked if I kept them. Returned and did not repurchase larger size; found other, better pants."
2.0,"These Jordans looked great on my son's feet and he had no complaints while he played basketball in them. Eventually several of the lace loops broke, so he wasn't able to wear them since there are no holes. Only had the shoes for 3 months before this happened. Won't be buying this style of Js anymore."
2.0,"The plastic backing was incredibly sharp on the inside of my lip. I filed one down so it didn't cause any cuts to form, like the first one I put in... The studs are also just a little to short to fit comfortably in my lip, but the product is a great concept, I'd much rather have the plastic vs the metal against my teeth, too bad it didn't work in my lips"
2.0,Item is very flimsy.
2.0,"I read the reviews and I expected some would be DOA, but not 40%! If you're not *counting* on having exactly 40 and can be flexible with the number of lights that work - then, seems like the price is still okay for 20-30 of them that might work out of your batch. I will say, that the ones that are functioning are very bright!"
2.0,It’s pretty but not when my arm turns green..
2.0,"My boys were so excited for these but the eyes are double thick fabric and you can't see at all. Makes the ""over the head"" part pointless and unsafe."
2.0,"The dress itself is very nice, but the sizing is way off...I was drowning in the small, it was quite literally falling off my shoulders"
2.0,It doesn't stay on even though I squeeze it as tight as possible. It also seems too fragile to last.
2.0,"I just received my dress it ant cute at all, it looks old and burnt out and this ant real jean I am 5 foot 124 Pounds and yes it fit good as ex it's just not cute the material look faded and run down  it's long wide dress that look like a old person would we're it and that's my opinion I guess I could wear it around the house to get some use out of it"
2.0,"I just don't like their returned policy, because I ended paying more for returned then the actual  merchandise itself."
2.0,Should be by size
2.0,The bank is just a hair too large to fit the Movado 2.0 but being I liked it so much my husband used a dremel to grind the edge of the band down just enough to get it to fit
2.0,"Half of them were bent, none of the backs would stay on, & there was one missing earring."
2.0,"I ordered two pair of these leggings. They look like a nice thick material that would wear well, but there is not very much stretch. Since there is no stretch, I would have needed to order a larger size but I didn’t try them on until it was too late to send them back. it doesn’t seem like they’d be very good for working out as there is no give but they might be nice in the winter. I like the colors I got them off and a gray. Hopefully someone at the Salvation Army will like them."
2.0,Fits well but quality is poor
2.0,"on paper, it does look like a good idea to conceal piercings but when it finally arrived it was too small and the length was too short to go through my ear comfortably."
2.0,"They look cute and aren’t very heavy. However, they are cheap and almost all of the items broke after one use (which I wasn’t rough or doing anything strenuous)."
2.0,Gift which was put together with a staple
2.0,These are great bracelets for little kids. Otherwise I don't know any adult who's hand is small enough to squeeze through the ring.
2.0,"The shirt runs big, the pants run small (short). It's a really cute set, but the top is quite sheer, almost see through. The pants are of a heavy weight. The tie is permanently sewn on. Our set came without the belt, so we returned it. For the price it's not terrible (If you manage to get the full set)"
2.0,Loves the hoodie but the sleeves felt too short for my liking.
2.0,TO LITTLE AND HOT AND ITCH CUTE SET
2.0,Description states two pair of earrings. This is erroneous. There is only one pair with a small package containing two clear beads.  I didn't try but I guess the idea is too interchange the glass beads. Doesn't look real easy and no note explaining how.
2.0,"Just ok nothing special, runs a bit small."
2.0,"I really didn't like this. Sizing was great, I'm always medium-large and a medium was plenty big enough but I hatedddd the swim suit material. Ive never worn this outside the house,"
2.0,"The dress came with a strange smell. I don't want to wash it since I plan on returning it, but even so the scent is just unbearable. The dress itself is made with a very odd material--almost like a spandex satin kinda feel. I didn't expect much, but I did expect more than this. The dress is just not of a high enough quality to merit the price (and the price isn't outrageous by any means)."
2.0,"In the shade it is hard to see because you can see the reflection of your eyes on the inside of the lens and in the sun you find yourself still squinting because of brightness. These look fashionable, but they are not functional as sunglasses."
2.0,Loved the headpiece when it arrived but within an hour of wearing it started to come unglued. I was able to temporarily fix it with double sided tape for most of the party but it was in 2 pieces by the end of the night. Such a shame because the jewels on the band were really pretty.
2.0,It is a cute dress.  Not as long as I expected but it is a good casual dress with a scarf.
2.0,"I was so excited to find this hat on Amazon, as it looked similar to a favorite wool hat I'd recently lost and can't seem to replace.  It had been my go-to rain, cold, everything hat.  I loved that hat.<br /><br />Well, I didn't love this one.  I'll be giving it to my friend to give to her 8 year-old daughter.<br /><br />This hat is bizarrely small.  Looks terrible on...rather like I was wearing a wool swim cap.  Sigh."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:47a25741261a6cce996a934b2efa7740]] Way to small for a 2x size I’ll probably just give this to my 9 year old
2.0,They were just okay..
2.0,The length was not there at all. Literally cropiest of crop tops
2.0,"They are cute, I'll say that.<br />But way too big, and too long.<br />Draw string is weird, shows in the back"
2.0,The picture doesn't accurately depict how thin the chain and pendant section are. It's a little embarrassing as a gift.
2.0,I wore the rings once and it already changed color. I didn't even let it touch water. It's poor quality 😞
2.0,"I loved the design but it truly runs small and tight. I had to return it. So, no further details can be given about product review."
2.0,"Okay so I'm 5'4, 135lbs and this literally comes down to my thighs... great for leggings but I use it as a pajama shirt now."
2.0,"Pretty, but baggy and ill-fitting. I went by the size chart and ordered the xs (I'm 100lbs, 5'0) and it's too baggy in the stomach and butt area. And where the applique is placed feels extremely itchy on my skin under the dress. Even if it was a good fit I would probably return it bc of how uncomfortable it was to wear."
2.0,"Frames were supposed to be green....they do not look green at all...they look black. If you go into the sun, they look a little lighter, but still not anywhere close to what the pic shows in Amazon."
2.0,Really disappointed. They looked really cool and got excited to finally work out using these things...extremely huge for my bar and you can feel that they'll break. Returning tomorrow and sticking to the old school clamps
2.0,Not like the picture.  I am  a 36C and it is very snug around the top. Cheaply made.
2.0,So nice but no what we expected
2.0,"I mostly adore this dress, but there is one detail that I find disagreeable. The little belt detail in front is not removable and makes the dress look cheap. I'm disappointed and will be returning  the dress, unfortunately. Fits as expected and all other aspects are wonderful!"
2.0,"I liked the shirt but it's a bit see through, wish it wasn't. And it wasn't as big as I wanted either, it kept rolling up all throughout the day when I wore it, having to keep pulling it down a lot. I loved the picture on it though so that's one thing I liked about it"
2.0,this was not the color that came..i received a silver color...and wanted the gun metal look.  I was disappointed.  The top is ok but the fit is spot on.
2.0,I liked the material and closures. It fit the watch well. However the fabric has a different colour on the inside vs the outside so when installed you have a band with one color on one side of the watch and another on the other side. Kind of tacky.
2.0,"Wore them several times no problems, until when zipping them up as usual, they split along the seam like a page in a perforated coloring book. The stitches were so close together and they were single stitched seams, so practically like cutting the leather. Sure, they are real leather, but the thinnest leather I've ever seen. So flimsy. I can't imagine these would hold up if I went down, so they went back.<br /><br />I'm a size 12-14 pants and got the 5xl. Probably could have gone with the 4xl if I didn't have such muscular calves; thigh area gaped and slid down since it didn't go as high up past my knee as I thought. I'm 5' 6""."
2.0,"The vest has a good look and feel it sized correctly. The material is soft and feels good and the stitching looks pretty good.  The actual heating sections are only about 2 and a 1/2 by 4"" wide. There is one of them on each shoulder 1 on the middle of the back and One on each side of the zipper. As far as the heat goes they don't put off a whole lot I don't think you would get much comfort out of this unless you had it under a coat with more insulation Like using it as part of your base layer. The other problem with it it randomly shuts off and sometimes when you turn it on it just flashes you can't get it to set on to a certain temperature.  The other drawback is it does not come with a battery. In my opinion the product would be better if it had larger heating sections more insulated material and A more stable control. It somewhat works sometimes."
2.0,Arrived broken and missing a claw hook. Very disappointed. Had to return. Other than that it was cheap but looked nice. Would have kept it had I been able to find the claw hook.
2.0,"Since when do elves wear orange?  The colors on these leggings are orangish red, green and black.  Another disappointment."
2.0,"I got this dress because it was $10 or so.. I ordered an XL but got sent a Small, and now my size is sold out so I guess I don't actually get to have this dress but ill review what I can. Most of the dresses on this listing are $23-25 or so. Sometimes you can find a color and size on sale for $10 etc. So thats why I took a chance lol<br /><br />Do not pay more than 10 bucks for this dress. Walmart quality is better. With that being said-<br /><br />So it is sheer but I think if you throw a light weight slip on underneath it would probably be fine. It's not as bad I thought it could be upon opening.<br /><br />The fabric doesn't seem very stretchy or soft at all, not flowy, and the colors are more dull but not insanely horrible.<br /><br />The stitching throughout was not bad as I saw on some of these reviews, and pockets and bottom hem were made with no issues.<br /><br />Cheap casual summer dress. I feel like you could make it look nicer if you tried. Id get ti for $10, but definitely not worth $25"
2.0,I tried to make this my &#34;new look.&#34; Big disappointment. They don't stay in place well enough to incorporate into a style or look.
2.0,It’s very cute but sizing seems to be for the smaller frame. Too tight in the arms and shoulders.
2.0,washed once and the magnet detached.
2.0,Runs very small. Buy bigger size then you would normally wear.
2.0,"These socks are scratchy, short, and uncomfortable where the elastic hits the ankle. I am going to give them to Goodwill."
2.0,"I was unaware that this wasn’t one piece. I have lost all of the center portions of each ring. I would not make this purchase nor recommend to anyone.<br />It was light, obviously and was comfortable. However, they didn’t last long because I just lost my last center piece."
2.0,Fabric is too thin.  Almost like sheer.  I ordered the Beige color and it was true to color.  I orderededium and It fits everywhere else except the arms.  The fitting around my arms is too tight.  But then maybe I have have big arms as I lift weights. But they're not mascular at all.  Either way I wished it was stretchable. I'm returning it.
2.0,Was poorly made
2.0,We bought these in camouflage for back to school and they fit so well that my son wanted them in another color.  These are not slim fitting like our first pair.  My son is 12 we bought a size 10 expecting them to fit like the first pair.  They are baggy.
2.0,I disliked the fact that it turns very fast  chain and pendent
2.0,This snags on everything. I had at least 10 obvious thread snags after wearing it just once.
2.0,Way larger than size chart indicated and it arrived with a hole in it.
2.0,"This bracelet is pretty but stiff and came with a ""kink"" in it. I returned it because of the kink & didn't reorder because I was fearful another would kink too."
2.0,"My kids and son-in-law are all dressing up for Halloween this year with a disco theme. The girls already have their costumes set, and ready to go. However, I had ordered this for my SIL, who is much smaller in size. I had tried a different costume 1st, that I ended up having to return because it was just too big on him.<br /><br />I was so excited when I found this and it even had it in a size more apt to fit him. I was CRUSHED when it arrived and they'd sent it in size XL. Now, with that being said, it's a nice costume and made from decent material. We're going to try and make this work and I'll try to take in the pants, but it was def a disappointment."
2.0,I thought these glasses were for computer distance. They are not. They do not work any better than regular reading glasses. Have not noticed any difference in the advertised features of these glasses than my readers. They sit well and are comfortable but otherwise should just be advertised as regular reading glasses. Feel the title was deceptive
2.0,These were marked new in box but came used.  They had obviously been worn.  The soles of the shoes were not white.  I emailed the seller but never received a response.  The shoes are great.  The seller is not.
2.0,"The style is cute, but not flattering. Way too big and too long. The bust area was ok but the waist needed to be taken in by 1/2 inch and length by at least 1 inch. The fabric isn’t soft. It felt a bit scratchy.<br /><br />I’m 5’6 and 122lbs. Smalls fit me 99% of the time. I wish they would make the 'Fit' somewhat close to the actual size being offered. Also, the color in the picture is not even close to the color I got. Yellow is not mustard and red isn’t burgundy."
2.0,"Did not fit i tried it for a few days to break it in, but it did not help. I sent in a request to return it.  I tried to v return it and it said time expired.<br />Next time I'll just go to the store will not be ordering any shoes again."
2.0,Good quality. I mistakenly didn’t realize the gauge size was 16G. It was way too thick for my nose pericing. What I needed was a 20G.
2.0,"Great looking color combo but, feels very cheap. Still works and is light weight. Not too crazy about the metal pieces on the strap which can scratch your guitar."
2.0,didnt like fit
2.0,"SO SAD!  A beautiful dress but for a tall girl, this won't work.  The waist is up too high.  Also, if you get the black, know that the black top of the dress is a darker black than the skirt, so that the black waist band on the skirt is very different than the black top.  Looks like two non matching pieces sewn together. I'd get it in the orange (and in a much smaller size, the XL was huge, don't know why I thought that would work!), but the waist is too high.  So sad cuz it's so pretty!!!  Waaaah!"
2.0,The wrong color came.  It was more blue than pink and the latch to the necklace was broken when it arrived.
2.0,i don't like the fabric
2.0,I returned immediately. Just wasn't what I was looking for. I read reviews that said this was a little oversized which would have been okay but it was honestly huge on me. I'm 5'4 about 125 pounds - ordered a small. It was very very unflattering & the color was waaayyyyy too pink for my taste
2.0,They fit like skinny jeans. I even got a size larger and they are still tight.
2.0,Umm I’m not happy about this product in the picture it says GREY AND WHITE WORDS I got a dark grey with some blue words written. Nothing like the shirt I ordered and of course returning it would be a process and who knows when I’ll get it or if I’ll get it on time. You barely can see the words and need it for Father’s Day.
2.0,"I got it just as I was finishing packing my suitcase.  My flight leaves in 6 hours. Put it on to try it and the straps broke! Ugh. I'm so pissed at the poor quality of the stitching on this lovely item. I will be gone for two weeks and I won't be able to return it, so I have to take a needle and thread on my trip to repair it. Thanks for the extra work."
2.0,This jacket is very poor quality. I purchased one from another seller and it was very nice. This one has marks and scratches on the sleeves and it has a strong odor. I am sending it back. It is for a gift and I am frustrated.
2.0,"Purchased the 40mm size. They come in separate bags inside a 2-cent box (so, not really suitable for gift giving as received). That is okay since they were for me, but I could not unlatch either earring, even using increasing pressure. The hoop itself is so flimsy that it would bend each time I tried to release the latch. This was the case with BOTH earrings, so hard to think of as just a fluke. I have owned several pairs of hollow tube hoop earrings in white and yellow gold, and never had anything like this issue. It may be the 10K vs the 14K factor, I don't know, but I sent these back and ordered a similar style in 14K from Kohls. Hoping those are higher quality with the expected working latches! Personally, I love white gold hoop earrings because sterling silver in this style is usually not hollow, and so too heavy.<br /><br />Just be careful if you order - I had purchased a pair with free returns so was able to easily send back, and quickly got refunded."
2.0,Much bigger stones that I expected. I ended up turning the stone into a necklace. It's just a bit big for earrings.
2.0,Earings are too heavy for the post it came with...could not wear the earrings
2.0,Calling this compression tops is hysterical. The fabric is very lightweight and has minimal stretch. My regular yoga & workout tops that don't claim to be compression are 100% more stretchy and supportive than these.<br />Straps were very long in proportion to the circumference<br />Returning
2.0,"It came double packaged, which was great, but the tie itself was incredibly frayed. Because I needed it for that evening I had to keep it, but I was not at all pleased with the quality of this bow tie."
2.0,The hat could be cute if you want to spend hours steaming and reshaping it after it come to you folded and with deep creases. So disappointed.
2.0,Color is not even close to picture. It looks washed out and dull with a lot more pink that in the photo
2.0,"This sport bra fits great. I got the 2-pack. The black one, after one wear, came unthreaded at the zipper. The purple one’s zipper came right off. I’m very disappointed in this product. Very comfortable and fits great, poorly made!"
2.0,They didn't work so sent back for refund.
2.0,Stone fell out after a couple of weeks.
2.0,It was small in the chest area I was popping out of the top and I ordered a size larger I have a bigger bust so if you are like me I would order 2 sizes up.
2.0,"This dress was listed as a woman’s dress . I was looking at adult dresses . The discription said it was an adult size . After buying it , the notification stated it was a child’s dress . It was too late to cancel it . It’s a super cute dress . But i had to return it ."
2.0,The frame is not even
2.0,"I am disappointed with this product... I had to remove base thread sewing from the product which is evident that sufficient time was not spend on the trimming or aesthetic of the finish goods...the style is nice but the fit is a bit tight. notwithstanding, i have decided to keep and wear with a very thin undershirt or t-shirt"
2.0,They aren’t comfortable like the other ones I’ve had
2.0,Dress is beautiful and if I didn't have boobs would have been perfect!!! Oh and I don't have really big boobs this dress is obviously cut for a child...
2.0,The Jersey is authentic but does not have the golden cup star on it as shown in the pictures. Not the product I was hoping to buy
2.0,Way too big. Much bigger than an x large camisoles I have already. Have to get it hemmed to fit.
2.0,The seam is completely open in the back of the pants. Fits perfectly otherwise and I love the color and lace trim.
2.0,"The swimsuit offers no support in the tummy or in the bust.  The ""bra"" pads move and fold in half and are completely useless.  I bought this to swim laps... not recommended."
2.0,Sized 2 sizes down and its huge. Worked with a belt but still didnt give much shape. Had lot about keeping but the material just isnt great. No stretch at all and not soft.  Returned.
2.0,"These sweatbands were cheap and I was able to get several at one time this way.  However, this is a case of you get what you pay for.  They are not very soft or absorbent.  The material felt rough and some of the sweat made it's way past my forehead and into my eyes.  I would not buy these again."
2.0,"Cute, looks sturdy, but breaks easily."
2.0,Runs small for anyone larger than a c cup
2.0,This shoes doesn’t have enough cushion
2.0,Product was deliver in a sack. No glasses case to protect it for delivery.<br />Device reached me and right lens was out. 👎🏾👎🏾 Not pleased about this
2.0,"In theory I think the dress would be adorable. I sized up one size, but it still was TINY! It was very poorly made too."
2.0,Way undersized compared to the sizing chart. You would need to buy about 2 sizes larger.
2.0,This was so much smaller than anticipated had to give it to one of the littler girls.
2.0,wasnt what i expected from description ended sending it back and getting another robe. Quality was so-so and was too short for me
2.0,The material was not what I expected. I had to return the item
2.0,Lots of condensation
2.0,Much smaller than stated size not very good quality
2.0,Very cheap quality of clothe! I was very dissapointed!!!
2.0,"Returning them. Pros: they’re soft, well priced and comfortable. Cons: there’s no compression and feel like there’s no spandex. Result is they’re horribly unflattering and unless you’re super toned, they show every dimple of cellulite.<br />Disappointing because it was a great price for the two pack and they’re very soft."
2.0,They are cute but a bit too big/heavy for my ears.
2.0,"Beautiful fabric but fit weird! The bust was really tight but the strap in the back had so much slack in it, I had to cut it apart and take out almost 8in of string and put it back together. The zipper on the side is cheap quality and hardly slides past the lace."
2.0,This robe was really thin and ran small. I got an large and it fit like a medium.
2.0,En la foto se ve blanco y la verdad es  transparente
2.0,Pretty colors but not as big as my other blanket scarves.  Make sure you confirm the size is what you are seeking.
2.0,i have only had the gloves a short period of time and only worn them a few times and they have already developed a hole in one glove.
2.0,My daughter loves that they light up. That's about all. The one shoe tongue ripped the first time putting them on.
2.0,I bought these socks for my son and husband. We only got one true pair and then 2 socks that said “if you can read this” my son wore his right away but my husband doesn’t have the complete set. I was disappointed and sad.
2.0,Nice material but magnet is not very strong!<br />Anyone can snatch it very easily(in NYC subway) and I am afraid the whole watch may drop off.<br />Not good when the watch costs $450!
2.0,"I bought these glasses a month ago and have absolutely loved them up until a couple days ago when they first broke. No biggie, it was a spot that was easily fixed with some gorilla glue. Not even joking, as soon as the glue was dry they broke in a different spot 😡 I’m pretty frustrated since these glasses are so cute, just made of very cheap, brittle plastic. For the price I can’t really complain, maybe I’ll need to get a hard case to keep the next pair from breaking."
2.0,Title says it’s sweatshirt. The shirt we received was more like a swimsuit material. Will be returning. Disappointing as this was a Christmas gift for my daughter 😔 she was like “why did you get this? 😳” Not as advertised IMO
2.0,"This purse failed to work in regular working conditions. I bought this December 2018 and July 2019 the purse is ripping apart at the seams of the straps, and the inside zipper fell out. Do not buy unless you only want a purse for 6 months! I can't even find out who I purchased it from. Why is it that we can't get a replacement or our money back? Very disappointed"
2.0,Falling apart after eight months with little use of the product
2.0,The quality of this item was not as good as I expected
2.0,Thin material. Cheap. I sent it back. It fit how I expected but was not flattering bc of the quality.
2.0,"While this mask is pretty from a distance, I was expecting actual embroidery- not a lookalike within fabric."
2.0,"Belt is really nice but buckle loosens itself after awhile, shouldn't happen."
2.0,The left shoe is perfect but the charger port on the right shoe is so bent that I can't get a charger into it.
2.0,After reading the mixed reviews I think I might be sending my order back or canceling my order.. I'm 5'8&#34; and Im going to need my skirt to be floor length almost ball gown length.  Im not looking for a ankle granny skirt!
2.0,"Fabric has no stretch and did not fit in the bust, much too small. Cute color though."
2.0,"These fleece leggings definitely kept me warm in the snow, but they pilled and snagged after one wear. Disappointed. I love my regular leggings Depot leggings."
2.0,Way too tight at the torso. Hard to get off and on. Shirt feels like Spanx.
2.0,"As with the &#34;Army Retired&#34; hat I purchased, the embroidery is off center. And I prefer I slightly higher crown. As such it's been relegated to the rear dash of my car."
2.0,"What a weird fit. I order by measurements and while this technically fit at the waist and hip, it was such a weird cut that my husband even made fun of me trying them on. Sadly, I am NOT blessed with curves. I have a straight hip, thin legs (compared to my rectangular torso) and these still hugged me in the most unflattering way. Strangely, they were just fine, length-wise (I'm 5'10"" and normally wear a tall inseam, but I figured I'd wear these shorter). Again, just the strangest fit I've ever tried, so I had to return them. Maybe it's just a cut I've never encountered before, or maybe it's just MY shape, but yikes. Also the fabric seemed a little thin, but the pants had quality stitching. The day I ordered them they were like $10! I wish they'd worked out!"
2.0,The fabric is good and the distressed material as well made but the fit is way too big
2.0,The person I bought this for did not like so I will be returning. The strap is cheaply made and looks like paper
2.0,Could not even put it on. Was way too small.
2.0,Sizing not right for American women.
2.0,It did not fit the Gear Fit SM-R350.  This item was two pieces. I gave it to my daughter. I did like the look of it though.
2.0,Junk nothing like the i picture in quality. Its ugly and heavy.
2.0,Ordered a 2xl. Is too tight around mid section and bust. Should have gotten maybe 1 or 2 sizes bigger for comfort.
2.0,"The same well-made, however they seem really large for children and I can't get them to seal on my little girl :("
2.0,Zipper broke off 2 days after we bought it
2.0,"Picture shows a messy, flat-top wig, but you get a shiny, rocker looking mullet wig instead. Also missing glasses, so I'll be returning regardless."
2.0,I could only use 2 of the 4 shipped.  The pins were not correctly fitted on the other two bands.
2.0,Very basic. No manufactre tags.
2.0,On time nice fabric but the seams are offset and it does not lay correctly on your body. You find yourself pulling and adjusting the shirt until you just take it off and wear something else. It’s made a comfy night shirt.
2.0,Mine came with a hole in the lining of the left glove.  Within days the stitching let go on the right glove.  They are comfy so that's too bad.
2.0,"Bought these wrist bands to fit my new ultra watch, although the item is as described I noticed that the quality on the rubber feels cheap and it’s also a little to long in length for my wrist. Aside from that product meets specs"
2.0,Was disappointed as they run on the small side.
2.0,The colors are not as vibrant and it fixed like a box cut.
2.0,to small  need to return
2.0,The metal rings where the strings go through the pants pull off very easily the fabric seems to be falling apart around it.
2.0,"Lovely dress, however, i wear a L, ordered an XL, dress is like Lycra. Fitted like a M.Super ridiculously tight. Should have returned the product."
2.0,"Size too big, material was not what I expected. Dress was disappointing"
2.0,I bought 9 pairs of different panties to try.. these were the most confusing fit out of all.  they actually seemed to be made backwards from what the pic shows.. so  i threw them away. not what i hoped for in any way.
2.0,"Just got the package and tried them on but haven't worn them much.  They look good, as picture, and are comfortable.  I'm a little disappointed by the sole - there isn't any to speak of, just a shear cloth bottom.  I don't expect a whole lot of support in a slipper but I would have preferred at least some minimal sole to allow me to step outside to grab the mail.  I'll try to update after wearing a bit longer.<br /><br />UPDATE: Taking off a star because the slippers are falling apart after barely six months (see picture).  I guess these are ok as a joke but not if you actually want them to last."
2.0,"Very large earrings disproportionately. Unfortunately, I will not wear them at all"
2.0,Not zero mag at top !
2.0,"Though I love the design, these earrings are quite small. My fault because I simply could not picture, even with measurements listed, the delicacy of these earrings. I shall most likely give them as a present to a young woman."
2.0,I can't fit this outfit and the strings were missing for me to even wear it. I could only try it on.
2.0,"I usually wear a medium, these were too tight and the elasticity isn't too good but tight fit. I have purchased the pocket and just fitness type shorts and leggings for 2 years now. It's all I wear is stretch leggings/shorts. These are the very first not to fit right. The tightness alone especially at bottom hem line, squeezed my knees. All pairs I purchased did not fit so it's the make themselves. They cost a pretty penny so its not so great when they don't fit right. Not for me."
2.0,So bummed - I had this hat for 2 months it stopped pairing with all our devices in our home. If anyone has any suggestions - please share!
2.0,This is a pretty ugly hat! It's scratchy and poor quality material. It's also very tacky looking. It looked okay in the photo online. I am disappointed.<br /><br />The brim does offer good coverage though.
2.0,It did not fit the bill!! Very Disappointed.
2.0,I ordered xxl because normally I uses L . To smal but good quality !
2.0,"The fit was good , it was comfortable, not itchy but warmth is not it’s strong suit, after a short walk at 22 degrees F the top of my head was cold to the touch, this is going back."
2.0,Nice look ...  but  very big  size  not
2.0,Very pretty but turns finger green
2.0,SOME OF THE SNAPS ARE MISSING AS THE OTHERS I PURCHASED.  LOVE THE COLOR..AGAIN SELLER SHOULD REPLACE BOTH BLUE ONES AND BROWN WITH SNAPS THAT ARE ALL THERE AND WORK... IF SELLER WOULD DO THIS ON ALL THREE I WOULD PURCHASE MORE AND OTHER COLORS...I ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO OTHERS WHO ASKED ME ABOUT WHERE I GOT THEM.. FAIR DEAL I WOULD SAY TO KEEP ME AS A RETIREN CUSTOMER
2.0,"Their cheap, break easly and i regret buying them. Stainless isnt suppose to tarnish and when ibrecieved them on was broken.."
2.0,Sole of boot was a slick manmade material making it easy to slip  & fall.  Should have had rubber with ridges to prevent this
2.0,"I tried it on many of my silver jewelries. It cleans it a little bit,  but it still gray and far away from being shining...  not a result that i expected"
2.0,Recieved wrong item. They're shorts and they're huge. I will try returning and ordering again but it's inconvenient and disappointing.
2.0,"It was smaller than I had imagined. Besides that, it was wrinkled from shipping and just didn't look like it was quality leather as had been promoted. I sent it back immediately."
2.0,"Unfortunately this band kept popping off.  After researching and trying to make it work, I had to return it."
2.0,"This bag is cute, but it’s really flimsy."
2.0,"Beautiful fabric but runs 2-sizes too small.  If you’re a curvy woman, size up to fit around your hips."
2.0,"The design is cool, but it is extremely thin and small for my 8 yr old's face.  I'd say that you would need to double up with this mask."
2.0,It's pretty good quality wise however the face is much smaller than picture appears. If you are looking for a dive size or oversized face then go with another option.
2.0,"It gaps too much on the shoulders, so it's lumpy under sweaters. Not going to wear, but not worth the time to return."
2.0,These socks fit okay but they have a strange material that makes them incredibly slippery.  I was going to give them to someone but changed my mind because I was afraid she would fall.  Not the average material for socks.  They're cute but the slippery part to them would keep me from purchasing these again.
2.0,"You should not buy this product. im giving it two stars because its warm<br /><br />Pros:<br />its warm, logo<br />Cons:<br />made for a child<br />feels like a cheap Walmart spare beanie<br />Fades fast<br /><br />Im sorry but i was expecting better coming from Poison Spyder. I would buy their armor... fix it PS, yall are better than this"
2.0,"This item was an experience, and I was not happy upon receipt.  It was not finished off the production line, it was missing buttons, and still had the markings to add them on, it was several sizes to large as well.  The fabric was soft, but my main concern with this jacket was the look, I was looking for something unique, and different, and living in florida, I often can get different types of jackets with no worries, especially thinner more fashionable ones.  This was a disappointment from the get go, the ordering was tedious, the returns and refund process through the seller was a nightmare, and I received different expectations every time they responded.  I will not be purchasing this item again, although I did get a refund after several weeks and many emails, it just really has turned me away from clothing form this manufacturer and seller.<br /><br />I did receive this item at a discount for an honest review."
2.0,Hardly to dress
2.0,"Ordered navy color, still a see-through dress. Nice look on model, but not so well on darker skin type of people."
2.0,"The fit wasn’t bad- the band and cups were about as expected. What I wasn’t expecting was for the band to be so tall under my arms. The side jammed all the way into my armpits, which was extremely uncomfortable. Unfortunately had to return it because there was no way I could stand wearing it for more than 5 min."
2.0,They broke the first time I washed it. The tie fell off
2.0,Doesn’t breath. Strange feel of fabric
2.0,It hasn’t been long but there’s already a hole in it! So disappointed. It also shows underwear line.
2.0,Nice and cute but these earrings are way to light
2.0,Very tight fitting.
2.0,"Even though this dress comes in plus sizes, I just didn't like the fit, so I returned it. It showed every roll that I have; :-) not flattering at all. Yes, I could have used a girdle or something, but it was not that cute to me to keep."
2.0,White part is see through!
2.0,I ordered these and half my order are either screwed on crooked or just too tight even with needle nose pliers they will not come apart.
2.0,These are very thin. I wish I had read more reviews prior to purchasing; these do not keep the kids dry or warm. Expensive for fashion and NOT the point of my purchase. Returned.
2.0,"Super cute, and received compliments, but twined bead unraveled during first wear."
2.0,Runs small and to short
2.0,"VERY very cheap material. Plastic. I know the price is cheap, but the quality was lower than,expected. It does look &#34;nice&#34;. Would not purchase again."
2.0,This is was suppose to be her costume for Halloween and the socks didn’t come with it.
2.0,"My wife, who is just about exactly average size for an American woman tried this on. She had to scrunch her shoulders to keep from damaging the garment. Her arms had no range of motion. So right off the mark this product is not as advertised. It is closer to a Small than a Large. Three quarter length sleeves may be a thing, but even when the snapped-up portion was released they did not reach her wrists. It would take a strangely proportioned woman to fit this.<br /><br />Taking a look at the jacket's construction, I was not impressed. The pockets were fake, just flaps where pockets should be. Anyone who has actually talked to women knows this is not acceptable. Women want pockets. It would not have damaged the appearance of the garment to provide pockets and would have only cost a few pennies, a definite strike against it.<br /><br />The stitching on the outside was adequate. I don't think the sleeves are going to come off in normal use. The stitching on the lining is another matter. The stitches are long and widely spaced and not terribly sturdy. The lining is not well sewn-in, and I am afraid it will start coming out in fairly short order.<br /><br />All in all this is not a good garment. The sizing is wrong. The construction is not great. The lack of pockets is worse than annoying."
2.0,The product is flat and does not even resemble what I was buying. Disappointed.
2.0,I wish I went one more size up.
2.0,"great fit in the waist, huge in the calves :/"
2.0,"LIKED COLOR AND DESIGN. ADVERT AS 3.94 INCHES WIDE, BUT ACTUALLY 3.4 IN WIDE"
2.0,Beautiful bracelet but super small. Definitely pay attention to the dimensions. I have very small wrists and it was too small for me.
2.0,"I was very disapponted in this product.  I thought it would be smaller and the pearls made it look gaudy.  It was hard to see the pearls in the picture online  The only good thing was the box chain.  I took the cross off the chain and used the chain for something else, so it wasn't a complete loss."
2.0,I wear a 38c bra and ordered this size. The band underneath was loose and the cups were so tight I could barely zip it up. The cups are a canvas material and have zero stretch. It created quite the 'uni-boob' Returned it.  Don't waste your $ on this ill fitting bra.
2.0,I went to an Biker Event and I needed my accessories that night the Necklace was Badass so I didn’t want to return this item just because the small earrings was missing out of the package... I love the bold necklace!!!!
2.0,No se ve elegante
2.0,Didn't look like picture. Cheap looking. Straps too weak
2.0,I wear a men's shoe size 10 and these are too small.
2.0,"My wife bought these for light gardening, and I just laughed. It wasn’t but a few hours into their maiden voyage that she was already missing one tip, and another a few hours later. The gloves themselves seem decent enough, but the claws are a gimmick."
2.0,Bought these and the pink ones for my two girls. The black ones came first and I put them up till the pink ones came. The pink ones came today and my girls were delighted with them. They love them. However the black pair is a flaw in it. Where the Velcro strap is attached the metal ring is broke. I don’t have pliers to bend it back so used a paper clip which is too weak. So I’ll have to buy pliers now to fix it.
2.0,"I had to go buy it of miccostumes website, it is more pricey but is definitely worth the cost"
2.0,"The lining is sewn incorrectly in one sleeve, meaning the lining wrinkles and twists away from the seam. It’s impossible to keep the outer seem of the jacket straight and comfortable without the inner lining bunching around your arm. Additionally, the sequins are not very shiny. The jacket is flimsy and poorly built. For the price, there are plenty of better options on amazon. Don’t let the pictures fool you. I purchased this for a Halloween costume because it had tails, but i will use my other blazer instead."
2.0,break
2.0,"They are very slippery! They do not stay in place at all. 2 stars only because they are super cute and if you stretch them out,  they'll stay but just won't hold your hair in place anymore."
2.0,"Really cute, small earrings. Don’t cause an allergic reaction at all. I definitely would have given more stars, but my daughter lost one after the first couple of days and it’s so small we can’t find it. The backs don’t fit right and come loose easily."
2.0,"Super cute, but only if you in the big booty crew. Meant for wide set hips and small thighs. Way too big in hip area for me. Only 105 and still tight on legs. Small was way too big. Meant for a pear shaped figure if that helps anyone before you buy. On any other body type, it’s terrible."
2.0,"Doesn't look at all like gold or the picture in advertisement. Semi- translucent with gold glitter inside- looks tacky. It is comfortable, but will returning, not as advertised."
2.0,Not the greatest material. It's is not flowy like I the picture. Fits small. Doesn't look as good as in the picture.
2.0,It's much shorter than it appears on the model. Had to return it.
2.0,"Received the wrong color, ordered white got the black and white. Cute but disappointing."
2.0,It's a nice workout shirt but the size is not what it is I got an XL and it is more like a small.
2.0,"Not a dress!!! Its more of a long top. My daughter loves it so we're keeping, but still disappointed!"
2.0,"This your off-brand t-shirt with a print on it.  The picture of this product is an official Futurama one, but in reality it's home-made in China."
2.0,"The first day I used the tote bag the shoulder strap broke, because it is cheap plastic, like all of the metal looking pieces are. One of the reasons I bought this was because of the cross body strap. Very disappointed it didn't last even 6 hours before it broke."
2.0,"Very cute, but gave it as a gift and the recipient forgot to take it off prior to showering and all the gold plating washed off on her! How embarrassing for me - it appeared that I gave her a very poorly made piece. Disappointing quality."
2.0,"Although this is a very pretty dress, there were imperfections in the length. The gown was full in the front and the length was perfect, however the back of the dress was much shorter than the length of the front of the dress. For that reason, it made it unflattering in the back and I would not recommend purchasing this dress."
2.0,Kept coming loose
2.0,The clasp is copper colored... not as it appears in picture.
2.0,These frames are way to small to fit and adult.  I decided to use them for reading glasses and not for sunglasses due to the small frame size.
2.0,"This dress is a great color and material, but it IS NOT wearable without leggings or shorts.... the slit is so high and right in the middle...with one step anyone in front of me would have seen my panties. The material is such that any pin or stitch to keep it closed would be very obvious and not look good.<br /><br />I also agree with others who said the belt loops are too big and too high.  For the belt to cover the waist line steam, it has to be at the very bottom of the loops, and then it inevitably rides up a little. And for some reason the loops are about 3 times bigger than they need to be to fit the belt, which looks a little weird in and of itself.<br /><br />Overall, I can overlook the belt loops, but would not recommend it because the slit basically makes it unwearable."
2.0,"Pros:<br />- Good quality material<br />- Warm; it's lined with fleece on the inside<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Sewn-on earmuffs are just too strange<br /><br />Overall: Not really impressed with this hat.  The quality of the yarn material is nice, but the ear flap is just strange."
2.0,I was hoping this would hold my hair bands. It does not. Also it tends to rotate on my wrist and the opening then pinches my skin and feels like it may come off. Otherwise it looks nice and I like the message inside. If the hair bands stayed on then the twisting wouldn't be an issue.
2.0,But it gapes open at the underarms.
2.0,"Look nice ,but they do not stay on"
2.0,"its was great the first 3 rides, then after only 2 weeks the elastic started to become weaker and weaker and it would get down to the knees .<br />i returned it and will be a better quality one ."
2.0,The design on the dress is similar but not exactly what is pictured in the photo. Seems to be a &#34;knockoff&#34; dress and not the real product.
2.0,"Love the shirt, but it REALLY DOES run quite small.  Ending up giving it to my teenage daughter.  She loves it when the clothes I order for me don't fit. LOL!!"
2.0,It was for a costume luckily so it’s not like i was wearing out often but it felt like a giant rubber band wrapped around my chest. Not exactly comfortable!
2.0,5’4” & 138lbs. These do not fit like the photo. I will Keep them and use them as ankle pants but beware the legs of these are very short! I’m short and they are short on me. To fit like The photo I would Have to be 5 foot short.
2.0,"I wear an XL or L in most things, sometimes will even go up to a 1X if it's inexpensive.  I bought the XXXL.  Couldn't get my arms in the sleeves at all.  I was preparing it to send back when my granddaughter stopped by.  She's 22 and a size 8.  It looked great on her.  The other thing I notices was that the trim around the neck and coming down to about breast level didn't lay flat.  The colors were good and vibrant, the material a little stiff. In their defense, I did not contact the company and like I mentioned, was prepared to send it back but my granddaughter snatched it up!"
2.0,Top was very small.
2.0,"These look really nice, loved the way they fit but they’re cheaply made as the lens just popped out of the frame. I did not drop them or anything, the plastic lens is just cheap. I wouldn’t recommend them."
2.0,"While these sports bras were the right size and the colors were accurate, there was absolutely no support. I ended up keeping these to wear for when I'm just lounging around the house or doing activities that aren't vigorous. If you're looking for an actual high impact bra because you're large chested and need the support, save your money and look elsewhere."
2.0,"The material is not bad, but the fit is awful."
2.0,Mother of Groom<br />Burgundy color was good. I sent back the too small item in exchange for too large dress.
2.0,"The posts are too thick, therefore they hurt my ears.  I love the way they look but I can't wear them."
2.0,"Its only been a month since I started wearing these and half of them already have holes in the toe. I have never had this problem with other socks. They were also were a bit thinner than expected. Too bad, I had high hopes for these and they are otherwise pretty good socks."
2.0,They are okay but I’ve gotten nicer brooches from Amazon.
2.0,Seriously uncomfortable. Barely any breast support. The straps were the worst! You're better off buying a different shaper. Wish I could return.
2.0,"This is too short even for people with small wrists. This watch band is an appropriate size for a teenager or child. It is not an American adult sizing, even for women.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Nice quality material.<br />Thick and durable.<br />Nice looking metal hardware.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Somewhat stiff.<br />Flimsy tool &amp; spring bars.<br />MUCH TOO SHORT."
2.0,"These reading glasses looked as unobtrusive as I had hoped.  They fit well, felt good, and were made well.  However, there were two things I couldn't live with. One was the slightly yellow cast on the world.  I think this is a ""feature not a bug"" because of it's ability to block blue light.  However, I didn't like it.  The deal breaker was that when I turned my head, even slightly, the lens distorted to the sides of my exact line of vision and the view kind of ""elongated"" very slightly,  It's hard to describe, but I shouldn't have seen any distortion what-so-ever. Other reading glasses that I have do not do this, and I can't live with it.  I returned them."
2.0,This product runs small
2.0,"I'll start by saying, I always have trouble finding long enough pants because I have long legs. These are 3 inch too long! The spandex material gets caught under my shoes no matter how high I pull them up, and because of the strechy material it keeps getting pulled down when I walk. I should have hemmed them up before I wore them, but I bought other kinds that seemed long, but didn't get too dirty on the bottom. Thats a big problem with these pants. They get pulled under my shoe for a minute without me realizing, then they are dingy and dirty looking. It has very thin material that is cool feeling, so I guess they are good for summer. Or layering. The material stretchs a little too thin on my bigger areas. Someone suggest I wear heels with them, but these would seem dangerous with heels! It has a very pretty material though."
2.0,Returned.  Fit is small and sweater construction is odd.
2.0,Too little coverage.
2.0,"The fabric of the sweatshirt is ok, however the fitment is a bit off. The body fit about as expected however the arms are totally off and not as pictured. First, they feel a bit short, and second, it is sooooooo baggy in the sleeves that it just did not feel right or comfortable."
2.0,Not true to size. No tag on the inside to show what the size it. Material great. Style great. Just to small which is a shame. Please put a tag in this item so people know what size it is supposed to be.
2.0,"The key chain is nice and it arrived pretty quickly.  It feels like machine engraving, not laser printing.<br /><br />Disappointed in the size of the engraving, however.  According to the seller, ""Your text will automatically be sized to fit the imprint area according to how many lines of text & the number of characters per line you are using. ""  I had two lines of 8 and 9 letters and while the font is pretty, the writing is so small, I can't read it without my glasses.  In the first row, each letter is roughly 1/16th of an inch wide.  And the second-row letters are smaller than the first.  The text is smaller than what is found on an animal's name tag.  Several reviewers wrote about the size of the engraving, but I was hoping the seller addressed that, especially when they wrote ""... your text will automatically be sized to fit.""  (I cannot imagine the size of the font if one had 5 rows of text.)<br /><br />Nice key chain for the price, disappointed in the engraving.  2 stars."
2.0,It was not at all thick enough to be a winter pijama
2.0,Sent me an xl when I ordered a large. Not much room in the crotch area so they don't fit as comfortable as other name brand briefs.
2.0,"The ring is fairly light-weight, so it can be worn most of the time, My main issue is that the top heart appears slanted whenever you twist it on all the wall. I will try wearing each part of the ring with separate belly rings to see if either is actually wearable."
2.0,It was as Stretchy as it seems on the commercial so I was highly disappointed and he doesn’t live up to the extra large size
2.0,"I was disappointed in this item. It is not leather, just brown cord. There is also a clasp that isn’t shown. I ended up cutting the charm out to use in another way."
2.0,Very tight with little stretch
2.0,"Really tight around the arms, the “adult size” is must be medium. I was hoping for a large…The quality is alright.."
2.0,Can’t see thru the plastic
2.0,Tarnished after only a few times wearing it.
2.0,"The bathing suit is made well enough but the proportions are off, it will not fir anyone correctly that is over 5'2 1/2 it is so small that way. I am 5'7 and I can not wear it because the very top will not cover my nipple. Otherwise it would have been great for the price, I see why models have to be taller than average."
2.0,The size on these run small. The waist was alright but the legs were much tighter than I had pictured.
2.0,"AS LONG AS YOU DON'T NEED A PINK BAG......  WHILE IT IS A NICE LEATHER, STRAPS COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER AND IT IS LAVENDER!!!!  SENDING IT BACK!"
2.0,Love the hat but waited to long for it to arrive
2.0,"I was so happy when this dress arrived it looked just like the picture and the material was light and fresh as I had hoped.  The adjustable straps really got me as i'm short and have a hard time finding long dresses i wont step on.  I loved this dress until I slipped it on and noticed a big gaping whole down the center seem right in between my chest.  looks like a bad sewing job.  I was considering sewing the dress, but the whole has started to fray....so disappointed."
2.0,Great dress! Love it. But not the best quality. Split at the seam the 3rd time I wore it. Not able to sew it back together because the fabric was frayed.
2.0,"Maybe this is my bad for not reading the description close enough, but when it said the wrist length was adjustable I assumed this band would work for me.  Unfortionatly what I realized is that this band can only be adjusted to smaller sizes.  It doesn't come with any extra links, and the defaut size it comes as may be too small for some people."
2.0,"These sleeves work very nicely to protect my arms from bruising and sunburn. However the hems started unraveling about a month ago, two months after they arrived. I wanted to to return them, but it has been too long. I can still wear them, but I have to trim the threads after I put them on. I will certainly get a different brand next time."
2.0,Item broke when tried to put on.... :(
2.0,"I sadly cannot recommend this outfit. It wasn't clear in the description but the shirt and top are one piece. The skirt is extremely short and tight, not allowing for any undergarments to be worn without being shown. I was hoping to wear it for an &#34;Around the World&#34; party, so it was a little too revealing for me. I think it could work for someone wearing it at home or in the bedroom possibly. I usually wear an XS and it was pretty tight on me."
2.0,These earrings were very small.
2.0,I don’t like it!!
2.0,Feels like paper.  Pockets came loose after wearing 3 times.  Very cheap.
2.0,Cute n comfy but way too small
2.0,the rings were to small for my finger cannot wear waste time and money
2.0,Nice glasses but NOT BIFOCAL. Just a simple pair of readers.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:d8cc83a19962b44d84f82e226985030a]] Bulbs have powder circles where fruits settled. Many of the caps were off center, especially one of the grapes, where the little grape cutouts keep falling out because there is no proper closure. When I tried to twist off the top to clean the powder off with a cotton swab, it came off in my hand and it was not made of metal; it was some sort of gray plastic. I’m lucky if I can find one good side of each fruit type to make at least one each pair of earrings. The rest were a waste."
2.0,I was very excited about these after reading so many positive reviews.<br /><br />Here are the details:<br />5’8 150LB Waist- 27 Hips- 38 Butt-42<br />Ordered size medium.<br /><br />The waistband is one of those where there is a wide pocket and then a narrow strip of elastic fed through it. The kind where it can flip around in there. They are thin and transparent when you pull them a bit. They feel very cheap when you touch them. I typically wear a medium and these are fine but they do run slightly large. They are not flattering in that they show every panty line and nook and cranny. They are fine paired with an oversized shirt and comfortable and the pockets are great because they hold the phone and the keys. So for me they are great for walking the dogs or for errands since I don’t use a purse. However I couldn’t pair them with a crop top because they are not flattering because of how thin they are. I have not tried them in a work out so I’m not sure how they would hold up. I will say the length is very comfortable because they are not too long were they look like capris but definitely not too short where you have to be pulling them down constantly.
2.0,I literally never wear these because the material is cheap and will stretch out over time I don’t like the fabric at all.
2.0,"I am pretty disappointed by the item I received. While it is very nice, I chose this particular karate belt display because the wood in the picture appeared darker and more rustic looking. When I received it, the wood was actually light in color. I wouldn't be so upset except for the fact that if I had wanted a lighter one, I could have gotten it much cheaper. I specifically picked this one which was about $25-$30 more because I liked the color. It wasn't about the cost, it was about the color and quality."
2.0,"These are pretty, but cannot be used for PPE - the material is thin and flimsy. For fashion purposes, it's fine, but then what's the point of that when we're in a pandemic?"
2.0,I was excited to finally get something that will allow me to wear heavier earrings. Unfortunately the holes weren’t big enough to fit most of my earrings. Disappointed
2.0,Re-usability is questionable at best. Meh.
2.0,cancelled order as I wanted it for Christmas Eve -- it came anyway
2.0,"I bought these, teehee and boardroom socks. This one did not hold up very well and was not cheap compared to the others."
2.0,"Very soft material, but shorter than expected. Not like boxers."
2.0,Very cheap thin plastic &#34;jars&#34; and the items inside are as expected.  I don't think this was really worth what I paid for it.
2.0,So I bought the original one which costs 30 dollars and is hand stamped from Etsy. This one is very cheaply made which makes sense for the price. But this one I’ll use for my key chain since i won’t care when it breaks off.
2.0,Used ones and next time I intended to use it had a hole in the back. Never washed.
2.0,It was smaller then I thought no the long strap broke.
2.0,Not fit to size. Plus see through. Material is not good. Very disappointed. Tried to reach the company. No response.
2.0,Cute idea but the pants are really baggy so it all looks stupid.
2.0,Hands still get cold
2.0,Looked cheap the silver is real thin
2.0,"5'1, 105lb -Too large for me ordered small"
2.0,These were not what I expected way to big and wouldn't even fit throw my cartilage piercing.
2.0,The hat arrived dirty with mud marks on it.
2.0,"I sized up a size and these were still way too small. The fabric is soft but they appear slightly see-through. I am 5’2’’ and the length was fine, but my complaint was the waistband."
2.0,These are a bit small. Additionally there is a seam on the bridge of the glasses. Just not as good looking in person.
2.0,"Really beautiful necklace. However, within two or three days of the purchase, the little circle piece on the necklace broke."
2.0,Runs way too small. But very cute.
2.0,"Twice I ordered this and upped the size, no difference it still so short lol if you want your titties hanging out then!"
2.0,Misleading photo as the shoulders in the picture appear to have some lacey sleeves WHICH IT DOES NOT. I like the overall skirt/overall style regardless but I was disappointed that the cute sleeves were nothing but a deceiving false advertisement.
2.0,Ordered the V-neck but received the high neck. The material is scratchy and the high neck feels like it’s choking me. I even sized up and I’m usually a small.
2.0,The outfit is very cheaply made the seam is already coming undone the material is see threw and the top is to big
2.0,The earrings are super small. Don't get me wrong they are still really cute but really small. Luckily I bought them for a teenager so it won't be a problem. But I was disappointed at how small they are. I received them earlier then I was supposed to so that was awesome.
2.0,The packaging says Navy but these are clearly black.  We will keep them because my daughter could use black but the packaging was mislabeled.
2.0,Nothing like the picture horrible masks with a neck attached very uncomfortable. Waste of money
2.0,Pretty but broke already on second day
2.0,"I was expecting it to be somewhat like a skater dress, but less of the &#34;dress&#34; part. I expected to wear this &#34;shirt&#34; as a dressy shirt, with leggings.<br />When I received my package I was extremely excited, I'm pregnant and really thought it would accentuate my bump while making me feel somewhat pretty.<br />I put it on, and it looked absolutely atrocious. It was not decently made, the stitching on the back was way off from the center and for someone who actually has decently sized hips, I was expecting to fill it out a bit more. I typically wear a size medium, so I ordered a medium. I would say it fit more like an ill fitting extra large but was tight on my bump. Needless to say I'll be throwing it in the trash, such a shame since I was so ecstatic."
2.0,I got a large and I am not a large I’m a small but I’m very tall so I get larger sizes. The large barey fit me and the material made my skin crawl. If you’re wearing it for a small amount of time I’d suggest it’s worth it but you can either make a replica or get something like it somewhere else.
2.0,Not true to size. Add a size up at minimum
2.0,I received a wrong watch so i returned it immediately.
2.0,"the necklace in the picture does not look like the product. the rose was a weird yellow color and sticks out way too far. the rose then popped right off of the necklace once i turned it over because the back is open and when my finger pressed against the back of it to turn it over the rose fell off. it wasn't an expensive product, but it was definitely not what i wanted."
2.0,Bill is too long imo.
2.0,I brought this dress because I have the purple one from another seller and I love it but this one shows everything idk if it's the color but you can by bra underwear and all my cellulite and belly fat... I will return its very sort and fits well but the material is just too thin... I was wearing a pad and my husband told me he could see it smh 🤦 😒 😪
2.0,"After I washed it , it started looking like it came from wall mart"
2.0,Cut small to right for my foot &amp; I wear a 8.5 I ordered a 9 because of the brand name
2.0,Ill fitting and uncomfortable. You get what you pay for!
2.0,"The sheers are pretty design-wise, have been in the wash and survived (in a lingerie bag) but the elastic around the top is unbelievable tight!  I have normal size or even smallish calves and the elastic digs into my skin and leaves a fairly uncomfortable mark when I remove them.  I would think twice before buying these.  If I had to do it again, I would buy the HUE brand trouser socks.  I got a 3 pack of those when I bought these and they are perfect!"
2.0,"They must have run out of gray zippers bc they put a black zipper on the gray hoodie I ordered. Also the zipper is CHEAP. The teeth are not smooth when open. If you run your fingers along it, it feels like you could hurt yourself. The fit itself is fine, which is why I gave 2 stars. Otherwise, VERY disappointed in this and will return."
2.0,"Cool concept, I wear a size 7 engagement ring without a wedding band currently so I got the adjustable sized package for when I do have my band and even the largest size option cut off my circulation and made my finger red and swollen."
2.0,"I guess I am a victim of good advertising.  Really disappointed on the material, fit and overall look of the product."
2.0,Too small.  I already own one so I know how it should fit.  Had to return mine.  One review warned me about the arms and overall size but I didn't listen because I already have one.  These ponchos have been resized .
2.0,Too have
2.0,"I have had my nose pierced for 14 years (ouch, that really just made me feel old) and have always preferred a nose bone or nose screw for the minimal look and ease of care. I work in a conservative office and though there is no policy against facial jewelry, I've always stayed on the conservative end. When I saw these with the bone on the end I was excited to try them out, even if just for the weekend for something a little fun. I've never gauged my nose so it has remained at the default 18g. So I ordered the 3/8&#34; size. Upon receiving I was very disappointed with the size of the bone (end). It is easily twice the size of my piercing hole. I attempted to lube up the hole and push it through but it was impossible. I also noticed while examining the piece that the actual hoop seemed to be very small. Curiously, I pushed it through backwards to confirm and it just barely cleared the edge of my nostril. I really don't think I have a large nose so I was surprised at how small it seemed. The actual jewelry seems very nice quality and would hold up well, I just wish there were a smaller gauge so I could truly try it out!<br /><br />♫♥☺♪ I have received this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product, based upon my own personal experience.

2.0,"Loved how it looked on. Fit great, very flattering BUT a seam was coming undone and the hangy strap across the back of the neck was just hanging on by a thread. Literally."
2.0,"Some reviews stated the color of the lens blue, some stated it was grey. The pair I got the lens is grey on the edges of the lens and the bifocal, the rest of the lens has a yellow tint to it. I was looking for grey not yellow."
2.0,"Definitely not comfortable, light weight but the sols inside are cheap material so feel like they’re not even there, and you can feel the stitching on the side of your foot, but hey you get what you pay for ."
2.0,Too small and I even sized up 2 sizes as per previous reviews due toopadding. There was a ton of padding so I can see where it would add 2 cup sizes. I believe this bra is for an A cup.
2.0,I had a problem keeping them up over my nose because the silkiness of the material. Maybe if there were a hem (a little thickness) in the bridge of the nose would help keep it up. I use it because of COVID 19.
2.0,A cheaper option to a superior model.<br />Capture rod lost a pin on first day - rendering product useless and broken.
2.0,Battery pocket is way to bulky
2.0,Rings look as if they came out of a cracker jack box... You spend little money and it's pretty much what you get in return...They are plastic not metal...
2.0,Works as a regular sports bra and the front zip is nice but it doesn't have nearly as much compression as I expected and wanted to help support my broken rib.
2.0,Beautiful gloves.  Sizes definitely runs small.  I wear a L in most gloves and these are definitely too small.  Daughter is getting nice Christmas present.  Wish they had an XL.
2.0,Comes open to easy
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Very heavy material.  Somewhat large.
2.0,"Did not come in any kind of packaging... Seemed a little unsanitary... Just in a plastic bag. Does not have a name brand on it... Material seems okay, fits a little big."
2.0,The inside lining and the strap felt cheap. Returned it.
2.0,"Style - 5/5<br />Durability of the lining 0/5<br />I literally had to hand-sew the lining seems as they ripped within 5 minutes of putting it on the first time. Of course, since the material is terrible, those ripped through too. It's a shame, because I got a lot of compliments on the style."
2.0,"The clasp won’t open. It was very difficult to figure out. I need help taking it off. I wore mine in the shower and it made the finish wash off. And I the copper turned into a patina color on the inside. Sorry, but I definitely won't make this purchase again."
2.0,The ball pops out to easy
2.0,"This is an absolutely beautiful dress but I cannot imagine anyone fitting into the bust untless they have fake boobs that are perky and HUGE. This momma of 2 has a DD and was DROWNING. So pretty, but I don't have time to get alterations done, so it's getting returned."
2.0,It was too small for my face
2.0,very cheap material and also the button is in middle of cleavage when it should be closer to belly button maybe would work for a shorter person
2.0,"The purse looks very nice.  I really like the style of it.  However, there was a hole in the outside zip pocket causing everything in that section to slip inside the purse.  Additionally, two holes were inside the purse which happened within the first week of me getting the purse.  The quality of the purse is not good.  I am not a seamstress by far, but I sewed the holes close and have not had any problems since.  Three holes in a purse is rather excessive for a new purchase."
2.0,It's a nice bag but the shoulder strap broke after a few weeks of use. I haven't been able to fix it and most of the bag's value is derived from being able to throw my gym stuff over my shoulder.
2.0,"These slippers were so cute, my daughter was so happy.  She wore them a total of one hour before the seam in the back of the slipper came undone.  She was so disappointed and blamed herself.  So not the reaction i wanted fir her.  However I was able to sew it back together.  I can just imagine if I was giving these to someone else how they would feel.  I turned out to be the hero yesterday but how flimsy.  Please do better"
2.0,Has sort of rough edges and doesn’t spin easily
2.0,"Quite gimmicky; but I do use it because I figure that I won't have to wind this ""automatic"" watch more than twice a day anyway. Perhaps it's just the watch. I mean I'm not talking a Swiss made watch here, even though, it claims to be on the back....<br />SMS"
2.0,Dress fits extremity tight in the chest area!
2.0,"As soon as I got it, the string came out and I'm not able to use it til I did it. The quality is underwhelming. The mask is too small and itchy. PASS."
2.0,it's beautiful but too small
2.0,It was supposed to be a size 5-6 it looked more like a size 10
2.0,I bought these for the secure deep zippered pockets.  First time I put them on I stuck a couple bucks in my pocket. I reached in to get that money to pay for my dinner my hand went straight through.  There was a hole in the pocket.  Unfortunately my entire family took back to back turns getting Covid. By the time I was even able to try these on I was outside of the return window.  So I am unable to return.
2.0,"These are NOT weights....When worn, they don't hang, they kinda flip up or flip put in an odd spot in my earring hole...they have no substance to them at all! Also, the wood isn't protected with a clear coating, so thry absorb any moisture which in turn makes the wood jewelry stink!! What girl can roll with the funk? I promise you, its not me!! I've had wooden weights before and they were heavy...in fact they were perfect weight...they stretched my gauged holes without incident.  That is what I had expected to arrive ....I was disappointed. If you do carry hoops like these that are heavier, i'm interested! Thanks and sorry."
2.0,Its a polyester. Scam.
2.0,"Picture gave impression it opened in front, but needs to be put over your head in order to get it on.  Also waist band was actually closer to under my breasts.  Size seemed too large.  Disappointing."
2.0,Dress is paper thin and unwearable unless you have a slip. Didn't even bother trying it on. Just took it out of the package and saw it through the light.
2.0,It wasnt the best quality and the dress was too small.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"Too short even for average height people.  Color and fabric are nice, but fit is not good."
2.0,This item runs small. I read all reviews and purchased my size accordingly 😔
2.0,Do not purchase if you’re slightly tall! Way to short even for a beach cover up. The shoulder pads are also hideous
2.0,Runs super super small. Sent back
2.0,At first I truly did like this band. Easy to use and very stylish.  Unfortunately the band broke after 3 weeks of use. This was a waste of money
2.0,"The bag does not look the same as the picture, the handle is too small ."
2.0,"Very good looking top but the fit was very, very small, even though I order larger than what I normally wear."
2.0,"nice and soft, but very disappointed in the sizing."
2.0,Soft but more like a bubblegum pink
2.0,Had to return. These ran long and baggy in the rear. Not very “tapered”.
2.0,I got the wrong dress. Still very cute but it wasn’t the dress in the picture.
2.0,"Sleeveless straps are too wide, they need to be closer to the neck. Appears to be a design flaw."
2.0,"It is pretty bright colors.  But, the colors are not joined and ribbon on the bottom ravens very easily."
2.0,Wings look much smaller and the rings itself are making my nipples itch
2.0,Seams show and it seems like it's made cheap. The velcro square on the front is not straight.
2.0,"The ring enhancer is not the one that was showed it’s okay but not what I was expecting, very disappointed!!"
2.0,Pants runs small
2.0,Cool shorts - feel like a bathing suit & much much larger than you would expect!
2.0,"The synthetic material does not breath and the adjustable clip in the back is so thin that it broke.  Now there is no way to keep the cap on securely.  I'd like my money back, but it's too late.  Never again."
2.0,"Really cute . But they kept falling out , really embarrassing 🥲"
2.0,"Runs small. Ordered xxx, usually wear XL. Was too small!"
2.0,The material is really really stiff. Almost as if the skirt has a hoop under it. The fabric makes it an uncomfortable dress.
2.0,The shorts fit tighter in some areas than would be expected. They run small. The shirt was true to size but has no shape to it. The color matched what was in the picture and the material felt pretty nice.
2.0,Too big for my 3 year old and 5 year old. I bought  bigger gloves for my 5 year old and his could almost fit me!!
2.0,for a one size fits all that is not possible. I am bigger in the hips butt area and they did not fit. Very disappointing cause i Loved the looks and feel.
2.0,The fabrics not bad but the sizes run really big
2.0,This band was fine and I was fairly happy with it.  4 months after I gave it to my husband however a link in it has broken and because of how it is made this isn't something we can just fix ourselves.  Unfortunately the return policy is only 30 days so there is no way to get it repaired or exchanged.
2.0,"I like the size and style of the purse, but that is all.  This purse is very poor quality, and I don't think it is real leather.  It doesn't feel like leather or smell like leather, and there is no identifying label that reads &#34;genuine leather&#34; or tells what material(s) are used in the construction  It has an unpleasant odor which they tried to cover up by inserting an air freshener, which doesn't help.  The strap has a leather look on the top side but looks like felt or some man-made material on the under side.  Also, the zipper is hard to close; it jams and doesn't slide easily.  I am returning the purse."
2.0,"Kinda poor quality, and if you use a dryer they're basically dead."
2.0,Im a D cup. It held nothing. Looked weird
2.0,Cute but NOT for a newborn!
2.0,Not as comfortable as they lead u to believe. Returned it
2.0,The material was a little rough and I was going to try wearing it during my hospital stay when having my baby girl.
2.0,"I needed it to be about 20-30 percent bigger, I could see the sunglasses as I was wearing them? Like the frame surrounding the glasses itself, like life was letterboxed."
2.0,The butt got all pilley after the first wash
2.0,"Cool idea, crappy build. Auit working right away"
2.0,I just got the necklace on May 29 2021 and as of June 3 it broke. I wore it two times. I disappointed it was pretty
2.0,Picture is smaller than pictured and fabric looks faded.
2.0,Item was clearly used already.. ugh
2.0,"Look and feel as expected, but these run very small... Choose a size up if you order."
2.0,"Not worth 198 bucks at all.  It is a pretty watch, I got a lot of compliments for it.  If you look closely at the watch the Roman numeral 4 is IIII rather then IV.  Seriously, how could you get that wrong!  That's a blatant mistake and devalues this watch completely for me.  Check out the photos on the site, every shot you CANNOT see the mistake b/c they KNOW its there and they do not want to show it.  Once you get it and you see it, its a huge disappointment. A watch that's SUPPOSEDLY 600-700 bucks should not have such errors."
2.0,"Over all fit ran much smaller than expected, and the quality of the shirt was subpar.  I wasa not at all impressed with this shirt.  Not likely to buy from this brand again.  There are definitely better options out there."
2.0,I pray that today finds you and yours Abundantly Blessed.<br /><br />This purse isn't leather✔️
2.0,"They look cheap.  I love Lily and Laura bracelets and I was hoping to mix these in with the L&Ls I already have ... nope!  I wasn't thrilled with the colors I received either.  There were only about 5 that I said ... oh, that's cute."
2.0,"Another disappointment from Amazon with a hat.  I am a regular shopper on Amazon and most of the time, I am thrilled. However, when it comes to hats, I just cant win. My head is actually small in my opinion and this hat fits me like a skull cap. Its thick and made &#34;OK&#34; but it is suitable for a grade school girl. It fits nothing like the photo shows. I'm going to keep it because I am lazy, but, it will be a barn work hat. It will be warm but it is not fashionable because it is small. Why not just market it as a girls hat, because it is not a woman's hat, not by a long shot."
2.0,"2-stars are only because I like the pants... Which is why I was so excited to find them in black. Only to discover on arrival, they're actually a brushed dark charcoal color, NOT BLACK."
2.0,Please note that these are not genuine leather. They are PU leather which is a leather substitute a.k.a. polyurethane leather. They do not breathe like real leather does and will not hold up very well. For the money these gloves are alright. I bought them for a costume I am making. First thing I did was cut out the soft but stinky fake fur linings.
2.0,This Watch Winder does not work.  I have a Tag watch and this does not wind it.  I have tried every setting and it just does not work.  I want to return it.
2.0,Runs too small and the dragon fly looks more like a horse fly. The tee is wrong color. The tshirt and print ate very dull!
2.0,"For the money, what do you expect.  It is very cheaply made.  The faux leather is very, very thin and I don't expect the product to last very long.  With that said, it's perfect for knocking around without worrying about causing it damage."
2.0,"i wear a 2x to 3x i bought these in 3xl! they fit like a regular xl im 6'4"" and 290 these 3xl were not even close to fitting yet 2 other brands of tight fitting dri fit compression shirts fit me in 2xl just fine! i returned for a refund is the only reason they got 2 stars, although they seemed well made and i liked the colors. sad they didnt even come close to fitting!"
2.0,"This is not the correct item.  It is a Pi, not a Psi.  May I get an exchange?"
2.0,"Way too large. I ordered a small & I am 126lbs, mostly hips and butt is where my weight is and it is super baggy. The sizing is way off. My mom wears large and it fits her at 156 lbs. The material is thick, it is not see through and the dress is just as seen in the pic but the sizing is way off. If you order, please downsize."
2.0,"Bought for my husband but hard to use, especially with arthritis."
2.0,I really wanted to love this dress. The length was great (just short enough) but the small was a bit big. (I'm 5'4&#34;ish and a buck thirty) The lace in the back didn't lay right and puckered when standing straight. The white underlay in the front was a bit grandma-ish too.
2.0,Not original - not polarized - not great at all. May have been better off using a magic marker and saran wrap.
2.0,Very poor quality doesn't look anything like the Amazon advertisement
2.0,Seems like a nice belt but I can't figure out an easier way to tighten it. Every one on here is saying it's the easiest thing but I have to tug really hard for it to either not budge at all or it barely tightens at all. I wish there were instructions or some kind of tutorial video.
2.0,"I would not buy this product based on the reviews - quality of material and construction.  But the patterns are gorgeous, and whoever creates them, should find a different manufacturer, pay more and charge more - missing a market chance."
2.0,Bought this for my daughter and it was like a night gown. Ordered it based on their site description.
2.0,I had to wash it it had a mildew smell
2.0,"It looks cheap , not worth the money, and if you want to return it,  they want to charge you 3.50 to shipped back."
2.0,"This skirt runs a bit smaller, is sheer, and it shows all the cellulite you want to hide. Not a fan."
2.0,They run small but nice material.
2.0,The vest arrived with a broken zipper. Also does not heat as expected.
2.0,It make my feet sweaty.
2.0,I am 5’9” the dress is sooooooo short you can see my butt cheeks while I stand. Don’t even think about bending over! I will be returning it because it is too long of a shirt and too short to be a dress. My pj shirts are longer than this. The color is beautiful and the top half of the dress fit perfectly and looked super cute.
2.0,Not the biggest fan. Sticks out and bounces off my neck
2.0,Like the stile but very thin and see through material. Too long
2.0,Disliked the bottom of the garment. It doesn't sit right
2.0,The dress was beautiful but the sizing was completely off.  I returned based on the fact that I couldn't even button the size that I normally wear.
2.0,The fabric is not as classy as the picture makes it seem
2.0,"Yes, I know the description says ""thin"" but the fabrice these are made of is so thin that I worried they would have holes within one or two washes.  Sent them back."
2.0,I can not even wear this product which is sad. Although it seems to be a decent material it definitely is not for busty women if you want it to fit like the pictures. Still trying to find leggings that will work with it.
2.0,"After having three adults test the product, we found that the pressure needed to activate the light was more than our grandkids were able to apply.  (Unless there is some secret)"
2.0,[EDIT] Downgraded to two stars here. After a full day of wearing them it is apparent that the inside buttons that hold the whole thing up are brittle plastic as apposed to the nice buttons on the outside. My piece broke before the end of the day and I had to change.<br />[Previous Review]<br />Decent quality for the price but thigh area is problematic. Had to order two sizes up from my normal US jean size but the thigh area is still super tight and awkward if you're a bit muscular in the thighs or do squats or even thought about doing squats. I'm going to keep them as the rest of the product is fairly nice (albeit a bit thinner leather than I imagined but about right for the price). Pretty sure I'm going to split them somewhere after several drinks but lets roll the dice and see what happens.
2.0,"The long stick part of these earrings kept falling out because the metal part that goes into your lobe is way too short. I lost them multiple times the first night I wore them, and the last time I put them on it ended up falling out and getting lost. It's truly a bummer because they are super stylish and I really wanted to wear them often."
2.0,This was a kids cut not meant for a woman.
2.0,Disappointing. Fun product concept but it’s literally just a sticker on the metal plate frame. Likely won’t last long in the CA sun.
2.0,If these glasses were about $20 they would be a good buy. I payed $70 and they are not worth that price. Cheap plastic and easy to break.
2.0,"Update: the zipper stopped working. Suddenly the teeth were misaligned and it would open up.  Well not it won't even zip together. Cannot figure it out. Hoping the seller is willing to exchange. Having bad luck with zippers this year.<br /><br />It's soft, cozy, long, warm, zipper is heavy duty!  Ugh!  Great coat!  Only change would be to line the arms as well. Fits great, waist cinches in.  Doesn't make me loom huge abd I'm a round Gal. I love it. The outter material is smooth, not slippery like a regular jacket. I love it."
2.0,"Received item today, shipping time was 28 days from order date. But was earlier than expected/estimated.  Initial opinion is that it's pretty. I like the lace, not able to remove the rose easily  but the blue pendant is on backwards.  Doesn't seem like it would be an easy fix as the lace is thick around the circle, was also sewn on crooked.  Pendant is on a side lace instead of the pointed end of the lace.  Not worth time of sending it back for under $5."
2.0,"While the fabric is very stretchy and has a good fit, it is scratchy.  Who wants that next to their skin!  Returned them without thinking twice."
2.0,"It looks good at the beginning, but as time goes by the color starts to fade and the ring bends."
2.0,The material is good but they sent<br />One size too large.
2.0,Nice pants but material looks cheap.
2.0,"My mom told me I look like a janitor in these gloves :( they're not especially shiney, so I guess it's not obvious they're supposed to be satin."
2.0,Does not work well can not tighten belt
2.0,Itchy and break quickly
2.0,"I gave it 2 stars because it's the dress I expected...just WAYYYYYY to small.  I could have taken the XL I ordered and possibly made it into a skirt, but even that would have needed serious alterations."
2.0,"Some of the LED lights didn't work, and some the little rubber bands fell of easily. The idea is neat and the kids did have fun using them."
2.0,This is a Deer not an elk. Really people Deer antlers come forward like this. Elk antlers go back over the back of the elk. I'd love an ELK please
2.0,Would be a perfect dress for casual wear. Just didn't fit well. Price was good.
2.0,This dress is very see through and very very THIN material. I had bought it because I read a review saying it was thick material but it most definitely is not. You can see my underwear right throughout this dress.
2.0,These  are big earrings great for the set of Dynasty or Dalles !!!
2.0,"Material is super clingy, shirt sizing runs small."
2.0,Paper thin. Not what I was looking for. Returning
2.0,"The best thing about this shirt was the color(I got green). I am normally a S/M, and ordered a large based on reviews, but it was still too small. Also, I didn’t care for the material. Returned."
2.0,"I dislike that the bonnet is not wide enough for me because I have a lot of hair, this bonnet is for someone who has long braids not for curly hair because is not wide."
2.0,"Nice fit, but the material is thin. I have to wear a tank under it if I’m outside of my bedroom."
2.0,Weird fit<br />Scratchy material<br />Odd smell
2.0,This top appears to be a maternity top
2.0,Son un poco baratos pero no duran mucho
2.0,"I thought I was ordering the Casio that I'd recently lost, but this one is more suitable for a child or adolescent.  It's thin and small, and the buttons stick out to where if you bump it at all, the next thing you know it's in a different mode or changing time or date.  What I ended up doing with this thing is pulling off the wrist band halves and use keep it in my waist pouch for when I go on walks.  As I'm one of those odd fellows who intentionally lives without a cell phone, I still need a watch but this one isn't what I'd hoped for.<br /><br />What I'll likely end up doing is ordering another Casio but a more deluxe model that fits my wrist.  I miss the Casio I'd lost as it was an excellent, durable watch."
2.0,"I was thinking that the belly button ring would look the same as the picture, but when i stuck it in, it sank into my stomach. I had to flip it around the other way for it to pop out but it doesn't look good when you wear it."
2.0,"Beautiful piece, but it was broken befor the end of the occassion"
2.0,"It doesn’t take long and this sports bra is wiggling up. Unless you have no bounce at all, try a different bra."
2.0,Cute kinda... but not on me
2.0,Review after 6 months: This Bag is really cute but unfortunately not very well made. The lining is pulling away from the outside of the bag. I had the stitching on the shoulder strap reinforced because it was coming apart as well. While it is pretty it is not holding up well.<br /><br />Initila Review: I love this bag.  I received it and could not wait to load it up with my laptop and work materials.  It looks very professional and I get lots of compliments.  The pockets make organization easy. I love that it has handles and a shoulder strap so depending on what I am carrying I have choices in how I carry it.
2.0,Material is scratchy
2.0,"My grandson is 5 and didn't even get to wear them after having his script lenses put in. He held the arms to try them on & the top of the lens frame cracked and the lens popped out. This happened to both pairs we bought. If they are supposed to be flexible, the Whole frame should be flexible & No hard plastic. Enzodate kids are All flexible & No hard plastic. I'm out the money for the lenses, but I have learned a lesson.  I bought them for the color choices."
2.0,Bad plastic and the bar broke in half in my mouth
2.0,"Not great, kind of cheaply made. I bought another one on here from another seller and it was thicker and felt more like a dress, this one feels like cheap Nylons. It also rolls a lot. If you're just using it for pics, it will work fine. If you're trying to be sexy, it's going to look goofy."
2.0,"Sizing is way off, it runs very small. I'm returning because I don't like a top to cling tightly to me. The pic of the model makes it look like it is loose fitting. False advertising."
2.0,It's just a water proof bag. The added pocket at the bottom doesn't offer any real advantage. The bottom of this bag has no solid structure.
2.0,Way larger than I thought. Will have to donate them. I would 't wear them.
2.0,DONT LIKE THE CUALITY
2.0,"Won’t stay up, too big for my face.  Might fit a large person or man better"
2.0,Fit very tight I cannot wear them
2.0,Way too big and long. Order a size down
2.0,It's to small the silver is nice but the cross is to small I wish I knew before I brought it
2.0,"Thé ring wasn’t true to size. It’s a size smaller, so it’s snug! And the quality isn’t sharp like the picture. First time I’m not happy with a Harry Potter item! It’s not worth the $45!"
2.0,I ordered the 0-6months size and it was wayyyyy too big. My baby is 7 months old and 20lbs now and it still doesn't fit. Such a disappointment because the outfit is adorable.
2.0,It's a great buy IF you know where to apply the bra on the first time BUT if you're like me and make a mistake and have to take off the bra to re adjust it then it's a no brained that this isn't the bra for you :(
2.0,"Service is fast but the product band ripped from the cap on second wear, it was the stitching not the fabric."
2.0,"It fits odd, the sides where it &#34;covers the bra&#34; are loose and fall. I guess it depends on the body shape, but I am 38 D so I didn't think this could be aproblem. I dont wear it at all, might try to fix it and get rid of that piece of fabric"
2.0,"Bought for my 8 year old daughter and she broke it within a few days with normal wear. Not only did it break at the charm itself, but in trying to fix it it snapped in two other places as well. It was pretty, but now it's unusable."
2.0,"Don't waste your money. The earrings look slightly different from the photo. Their size is good, but the quality and the color are off."
2.0,The T-shirt fit well but at the first wash one of the shirts basically fell apart at the seam on the shoulder and neck line
2.0,Easily gets scuffed. I recommend putting them in a case.
2.0,Very cheap. Surely it isn't real leather.
2.0,"These trunks have a nice cut, however, the black color fades after a few washes, and they show holes and/or tears after a few more! There are better options out there if you don't mind the name!"
2.0,They put the buttons on the left-hand side like women’s clothes and it’s a real nuisance to button up. The material is made well and seems to be good otherwise
2.0,Not regular Jordan shorts. Weird design and fit.
2.0,Top was too small.  Cute suit though
2.0,"THIS IS NOT A CLUTCH! It's a wallet, a beautiful wallet but still a WALLET! Disappointed bc it's not what I expected but ill be keeping it since i needed a wallet anyway..."
2.0,"Bought these for my 3 year of daughter, and not only are they too small on her head they are also too small for her glasses. I couldn't even slide the ear pieces into the straps. I tried. It was frustrating. Save yourself the frustration and just buy the silicone ear pieces. So much easier!"
2.0,So I’m a 8 1/2. Ordered that and I should’ve gone with a 7 1/2.<br />The material and the comfort is nice though.<br />Cute color and style.
2.0,"Would have liked pants if there wasn’t a lot of loose thread and the button had not fallen off, did not want to go through the struggle of returning and replacing as the pants should have been in a new condition but I might just try and alter it.  Pants are very stretchy , typically a size 14, got an xxl and could have went with a xl."
2.0,"A bit disappointed with this product. It clearly was not properly made, as there is a thread hanging from the bracelet. Furthermore, the balls are huge in comparison to the picture. Less attractive when the balls are this size."
2.0,It too gold for me
2.0,"As other reviewers say, it is a very nice wallet.  But the quality of the ""leather"" won't stand a scratch.  It might cut the leather because it is so thin.  I bought it as a gift for someone and I am not sure to give it away..."
2.0,Ok watch...  Wore it twice and the clip for the band broke
2.0,Wayyy too big
2.0,This was made of pretty cheap quality plastic and was stiff to open and close. It also had too big eye lenses and did not flatter my face.
2.0,"They’re cute and cheap with room to grow into. The chemical smell is a concern. It’s strong, really strong. It’s a powerful chemically smell with what seems like an added perfume, perhaps to mask the other toxic fumes. We’ll be letting them off-gas outside for a few days before testing them for water permeability. Unlikely to buy again."
2.0,Since it wasn’t so expensive I didn’t end Uk returning but looks cheap.
2.0,"Too large, too gold."
2.0,"This band was wider, by a little, than 20mm. I couldn't get either side on my Gear Sport watch.  I have plenty of 20 mm bands and this one just did not work, even when I tried to cut it to fit, which didn't work."
2.0,the top was too small and the bottoms were too big. the back of the top is really quite confusing and i untied it because i thought it was a mistake and now i cannot redo it. i don't wear the bottoms or the top
2.0,"Measured my chest and selected a size larger just in case, apparently I got a child's large as I could not even get my arm in the sleeve... gave the shirts to my petite Girl and they even fit her tight"
2.0,"Not great quality, and not sure it’s really leather? Hinge broke after two weeks."
2.0,I wear an xl so that is what I ordered. I ended up giving it to my daughter who wears a med to large. It is really pretty and well made. I wish it came in a larger size. so disappointed I really wanted to wear it to a wedding.
2.0,"I'm 5'6"" and 130-135 lbs. Normally wear a size 5 or 6. Bought a medium and it was way too big. The top gapped open and came down so far the top of my bra was exposed. Washed it and put it in the dryer to try and shrink it, and it didn't help. I'm pissed because now I can't return it. The size medium is definitely for women who wear size 10 -12. I don't think size small would fit anyone less than size 8."
2.0,Appears classy but not got material
2.0,"Got it for gifting and it turned out to be larger than usual sizes.<br />Also, quality is a bit off than usual woollen clothing. Better quality at stores nearby for the same price."
2.0,I bought these with the intention of using permanent ink for my info. What the product description doesn't tell you is those white sections are actually raised up from the background. They are only 1/4&#34; high...that's way too narrow for me to write legibly without going off the writing area. I've returned them.<br /><br />One positive thing is they have a metal key ring style tag holder with a metal grommet. That makes them more durable than just the plastic ones.
2.0,Not as high waisted as I would like and it does roll down at waist.
2.0,It’s cheaply made and runs too small
2.0,"The large was not a large.. I could barley squeeze my arms through it and the chest was basically see through it was stretched out so far. (I am NOT bless in that area so if you got it going on up top beware 🙈) the rest of it was super cute , just couldn’t wear it.<br /><br />For context I wear a large in everything normally"
2.0,"These fit well and are comfy.  But the pockets are too big/bulky, and the material pills like crazy.  Not my favorites."
2.0,"Even though they say &#34;hypoallergenic&#34;, they still make my ears itch like super cheap metal does. I wonder if it's false advertising? I don't get it."
2.0,You get what you pay for and I got a dress that photographs well but in person is overpowering and dumpy on me.  Ordered a size up and still too tight.  Now on its way to Goodwill.
2.0,"Heavy material; bulky and clunky.  Large has a small waist, so it shouldn't be labeled large."
2.0,"Everything else fit true to size, but the long sleeves ended halfway up my forearm."
2.0,Did not like writing on back of shirt.
2.0,2 weeks old started pilling up on the sleeve cuffs. Very disappointed. Still searching for a quality zippered hodded sweatshirt.
2.0,"Wanted for a base layer for winter sports, but is very thin.  Not much for warmth.  Fits well though"
2.0,Stains on the shirt 😟
2.0,"Black one broke first day I got it, and put it in. It's impossible to close them. 2 stars because at least it is what I ordered and it's the same colors. But don't buy."
2.0,very itchy :( warm but itchy
2.0,Beautiful ring and very sparkly but I'm a bit disdapointed when the stones started falling off after wearing it a couple times :-(
2.0,Cute but didn't fit. I referenced the fit chart and reviews. Was hoping it'd shrink a bit in the wash but it didn't.
2.0,"Elastic stretched, now they are too large"
2.0,"Im sorry but the proportions were off overall.  I purchased an XL and thats my general size range(5 ft 7 inches, 200 lbs, 36DD and i have actual curves... im not just a box-y bigger girl).  The dress is an actual wrap dress which i really liked, however the bust area where the v-neck meets was very big to where id need a tank top underneath.  wasnt a huge problem.  Then my torso is long so the belt part wraps right under my boobs, which i didnt want but i can understand happens when you order online, not one size range obviously fits all.  Its also clearly transparent and see thru.  I wish it fit me the way i wanted it too but you get what you pay for.  The only thing that was accurate was the skirt, came mid-thigh maybe slightly longer.  I could wear this dress if i planned to have a tank top & slip that matched because again... very see thru.  And the hole where they say the belt slips through is sloppy and looks like it would rip easy because its not like a neat button sewn hole but just unsewn fabric."
2.0,Nice glasses the only issue is the screws keep coming unscrewed where the glasses hinge in and out
2.0,"Dress itself was ok, but not exactly what I was looking for. Dealing with the company trying to obtain the ""free returns"" on the listing was a headache. I requested multiple times for a prepaid label, was finally sent a label that was not prepaid (which they blamed on amazon), was asked to pay and they would reimburse me. When I declined, they finally sent a prepaid label. I returned the dress, and they submitted a refund"
2.0,The quality is not rally good !!!😖
2.0,I didn't realise the blue colour was varied.  I had hoped for a solid blue.  Nice bag otherwise.
2.0,Weird fabric!  Otherwise great product
2.0,I bought 2. Mine didn’t fit. Ran pretty small
2.0,"Didn't fit for long, kinda dissapointed :("
2.0,"bad quality, dont buy"
2.0,"Sturdy, although the pockets inside didn't make much sense - I have to flip the cover upside down when I open it because of the way the pockets inside the cover are set up. I wish I didn't have to do that, but otherwise, it is as I expected."
2.0,"These knickers are made with very thin materials, meaning your hairs start to poke threw immediately. The white grippers appeared to be nice at first but then I noticed that they did not seem to work at all to keep the knickers down by your calves. The  leg material kept bunching up under my knees. I will also say the the chamois pad seemed to bottom out very fast and the saddle hardness was noticeable. I think these would be a great buy with a bit more attention to fixing the noted issues."
2.0,Is a very cute clothes but runs way too small! I had to return :(
2.0,"Bought this sandal for my grandson and it is too small.  I ordered early since shipping is not reliable these days.  We would like to exchange for a bigger size, but now they say it is too late.  I ordered mid-June and the birthday party was July 23."
2.0,Looks like underwear material with lace sleeves. Its weird and not cute in my opinion.
2.0,"I wanted this coat to work so badly I ordered and returned it three times...<br />The small wouldn't have allowed me to wear a sweater underneath and the arms were too short.  Since they were continually sold out of medium in black I ordered a large (in the same style as well as the style with the slanted chest pockets) and the body was too large, which I expected but strangely enough, again, the arms were too short? Plus it came kind of messed up and tattered.  Just bummed, I really liked the look of this coat in the pictures."
2.0,I know what I spent but just don't feel the most comfortable able. For the price they will work but I've bought cheaper pairs that felt more comfortable.
2.0,"Of course I purchased this mask because of the USA flag on the front.  That is the only good thing about this mask.  It's very thick and difficult to breath through.  The straps are only adjustable for someone with a small head, not for an average western males head size.  There also is no nose metal strip to help prevent your glasses from fogging up.  I do not recommend this mask."
2.0,"I didn’t care for this shirt at all.  The material was okay but it looked like a scrub shirt on me (like nurses wear).  I was hoping I could use it to wear with some dress pants at work but I thought it looked weird.  Also, when I ordered this, I hadn’t noticed that it said Plus Size.  I’m not a plus size person.  My fault, but I ordered the large and the fit was pretty good.<br /><br />I didn’t like the high-low look and it made me look a little boxy.  The shirt is not very flattering in general.  It definitely hides the problem areas, a plus I guess.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.  All opinions are completely my own.  [...]"
2.0,"I always prefer pants with buttons.  Hadn't bought a pair with snap fasteners in over thirty years.  Even when I was skinny the fasteners weakened over time.  Took a chance on these and sadly the technology has not improved.  When I sit down or bend at the waist the snap pops open.  Wrangler was the only company that used a decent fastener.  Other than that the fit is ok.  There's plenty of slack in the waist, and it looks like the knees will hold up.  Won't be buying any more though.<br />And of course seven day after my purchase the price drops $7."
2.0,"This is a pretty little nose ring, but be sure you know what size fits you! No matter how hard I tried, it is impossible to get this hoop in my nose! I can't even use it."
2.0,This dress was not as cute or flattering in person. The material was not what I expected and overall it was just not anything I would wear out. It was returned.
2.0,Very cute! Looks just like picture But not true to size. I ordered a large and was a made like small/medium
2.0,"Let me start off with I did not buy this for myself.<br /><br />While I am a curvy, a unisex small/women’s medium fits my 5’5 frame well. I bought the 2XL for my fiancé who is 6’2 and 260....I believe this MIGHT be wide enough, but I’m betting that the waist band will be past his belt-line and the sleeves will be 3/4 length.<br /><br />Now, for the material, it is very thin. More comparable to a long sleeve shirt (well, besides the “long” sleeve part), but the inside is soft. I doubt it will last more than a couple washes and dries. The hoodie strings are also left loose, so I’m not sure how long it will be before they come unraveled. Also came with a pretty funky smell.<br /><br />I gave two stars instead of one because the designs ARE beautiful; that’s what sold me on the sweatshirt in the first place. Since it was quite cheap, I haven’t decided yet whether I’m going to return it or just keep it for myself as a lounge hoodie. If I keep it, I’ll update my review after a few washes and let y’all know the integrity of the designs, strings, and the material itself."
2.0,Picture shows this to be longer and I thought the material would be thicker. Not really worth the money but I still wear it once in a while.
2.0,"It was gorgeous when I first received it, but less than one year later the interior lining seams failed. The description says it will hold iPhone 6 Plus....that is certainly not the case. I would not purchase this again."
2.0,"As this set of squares was listed to go WITH the SquareGuard Pocket Square Holder (3-Pack), I didn't pay close enough attention to the size of the squares.  They are too small to fit properly in the chest pocket of a suit/sports coat."
2.0,The pattern is cute but the elastic strap down the middle is too tight on your head.
2.0,The color was washed out looked old and used..not flattering at all.
2.0,The fit was fine but the fabric looks cheap and it's too see through.
2.0,This just didn't fit me a plus sized adult but it fit my 10 year old perfectly
2.0,I bought a large and it fits more like a medium.<br />The color is also a lighter gray than the picture shows.
2.0,"I loved this gown, and ordered a sz 8; however, this gown apparently ran smaller than its actual size; preferably as a sz 6, because I could not pull this gown pass my hip"
2.0,"They are reasonably well made and attractive, but they don't all hang well. They are not weighted well so some of the butterflies hang upside down.  I know that butterflies fly that way, but not in my jewelry."
2.0,Do yourself a favor. Spend more on pants like this cause these are not worth the effort. They do function alright but are not breathable at all and look cheaply made
2.0,Fabric is cheap and made very cheap. Wish it was made with cotton.
2.0,"I liked the bottom part, but the top didn't fit well. Not enough material to cover and the little button didn't do much to hide a gap. I felt like it needed more fabric on the bottom part of the wrap so that it would tuck inside better. Returning."
2.0,"Kinks up a bit and some of the ""lab created"" stones are cloudy, haven't wore it enough to see if it will tarnish. Ok chain I suppose but was expecting something a little bit better but it works"
2.0,The band at the top of the sock should have a more relaxed fit. For a person with circulation problems the sock  cuts off  blood flow to upper leg. .
2.0,Fit is good but the material is very scratchy and irritating
2.0,Turned my toes green with in a few hours. Super sad they were cute at first
2.0,"I ordered this dress for work. It looked soft and comfortable and it had pockets. I could not have been more disappointed. What was pictured was different than what I received. The dress was made of some weird shiny material and felt strange next to my skin. The dress is also pictured with a belt. It arrived without a belt. No way to cover the fact that it didn't have a belt. Related to COVID-19 restrictions in my community, I missed the window to send this item back for a refund. Thank heaven it was not expensive.  I put in the local clothing donation box to go out soon. I definitely would not repurchase or recommend."
2.0,The bra was too small and ill fitting.
2.0,Cutecstyle but the glass is not cleat
2.0,"I don't see any hole puncher, you need it as it's way longer than I expected."
2.0,Ita cute broke after the first week. The tassels came out and I tried to super glue it back in but that didn't help.
2.0,It was way smaller than I thought from the picture. Great for a small laptop only really and then your fingers have to get past the zippers on the tight opening. I ended up donating it. But even a few days wear and tear the handle was peeling. It was not very expensive so that is fine. It did stand on its own very nice and look nice from afar.
2.0,Not safely set in box during shipping. Pearls were chipped. I would have kept if it had come to me in better condition.
2.0,I little small
2.0,Don't like it!  Not as expected!
2.0,nice color but too heavy.  immediately pulled my earlobe down/stretched it so i immediately took it off.  can't wear it.  want to return it.
2.0,Bad quality not what's advertised. Ripped after putting them on. Looks cheap.
2.0,This is very thin & see through. It's short if you're curvy.
2.0,Very difficult to close the ring once in your nose
2.0,"This bag has a nice appearance but it is not too functional.  I bought it to go on short day trips however I noticed right away that the bag was hard to pack because the zipper does not allow the bag to open completely.  Also, the lining is not sewed in and is annoying.  I was going to return it and try to find something different but by the time I got back from my trip the return window had closed.  Don't think I'll buy anything else from this company as now I'm stuck with this bag."
2.0,"This suit has no built in bra or any type of support whatsoever. It’s a shame because it was cute otherwise. I am returning the product because after having two kids and some weight loss, I NEED at least a shelf type bra. If you have a smaller chest or unusually perky gals then this may work."
2.0,"I couldn't really tell how they fit because the wrong size came, but it doesn't look/feel like there's enough arch support, going by what I could tell from feeling with my fingers. Also, the massage points seemed like they were too flat to provide good enough circulation stimulus. I couldn't tell from the picture. After opening the package, and looking up close,  I wouldn't order again, even if they sent me the correct size."
2.0,"Well, this is probably the lowest review I've ever done. It's a pretty color but sewing is not solid and seems really cheap. Yes, the price was cheap but it was so very small. Made for a tiny person."
2.0,This product runs extremely small!!  I have a. Small head and this is way too tight!  Cute pattern way to long and way too tight. Am returning
2.0,"I have a small face, so they fit me perfectly. They came bent. Very cheap"
2.0,"Cute, but very difficult putting on by yourself if you need it in the tightest position. Also, I have a wide wrist and it was still loose on me on tightest setting which made it turn around and not fit right."
2.0,It broke after having it less than a month.
2.0,"This version does not have the elasticity you see on the TV or social media brand ads.  Its tight going over the head, feels tight around the neck, and is not breathable (especially if bunched up over your nose when pulling on, very difficult to get air).  Maybe I received a child size in error, but I'll stick with the standard masks.  Only plus is a nice pattern and appears sewn together well."
2.0,"The fabric is plasticky in nature and very cheap looking up close. The inside contains netting/mesh and is somewhat scratchy to the touch.  It folds nicely and can be adjusted to fit smaller or larger.  However, it still does not fit if you have a lot of hair...!"
2.0,"I ordered two of these hats for my two sons and am returning both.  While they  look cute in the pictures, the quality is not as expected.  The material is quite thin and definitely not warm enough for a mid-west winter.  Also, the mittens don't have thumbs which would drive my 2.5 year old nuts!  I will find a warmer, more substantial alternative for my kids."
2.0,"They were small, too small for my feet. Returned."
2.0,The dress is nice and good quality material it just did not fit like I expected it to. Maybe its my body type but I might have to adjust it a little.
2.0,Well if you want it to be oversized order at least two sizes up and it smelled  musty almost like mildew. Immediately in the wash.
2.0,good. good durabilty
2.0,I'm glad we didn't pay the expensive price. I don't notice any difference in the night vision. The other ones for the day need to be darker.
2.0,"This is the bra size I always wear, and this was way too tight around the band, I understand this is supposed to be a &#34;sports bra&#34; but I wouldn't consider this to be one. The material was very thin, and inside the cups was like a second lining with holes that your breasts go in. I guess that's the &#34;no bounce&#34; thing. Maybe if you were a B or C cup you might get away with this bra working for you, but I wouldn't suggest anyone that is a D cup to buy this."
2.0,"The masks are excellent. But it seems this ""three pack"" comes with only two different styles and you don't know what you'll get a double of. I have no idea what the point of this kind of 3 pack is."
2.0,"Disappointed...got the three pack of black, white and gray size large as I am 6’3” 215. These are def not athletic fit and are cut really akward. The black is the closest to a large but the white and gray..are way too big. If I was to guess they are xl with large tags put on them. Ill wear at home gym but would not wear out in public...just really awkward fit."
2.0,Cross way smaller than in the picture and I wonder if its going to last
2.0,Sticky n stinky
2.0,"Padding is more in the back and not in the front as much. After semi-long to long rides, it makes for a very uncomfortable experience. Not the best bike shorts for women.<br /><br />The legs are great! Fabric is great too. Just the padding is off."
2.0,"Very cute in the picture. Not cute at all in person. Runs a little small. Color is also very dull, not bright like in the picture."
2.0,"They are very narrow and the ""suede"" that is on the collar rubbed off.  Not sure what happened....But what can you expect from $28 Timberlands?"
2.0,I bought this to use on my Pandora bracelet but it is not comparable to the stoppers I already have.  It is smaller in size and looks out of place.  If you want an imitation Pandora bracelet this would work fine.
2.0,"I am a Paramedic. I us my Apple Watch an awful lot. I very much like how it looks. Very light weight. I will follow up with a durablity/full review in six months. So far it is everything I was looking for.  UPDATE; Pro, as listed before. Con/Durability, It lasted 21 days. The band fell apart last night. Very disappointed."
2.0,"So here's the problem. I wore this for my senior prom in high school with a dress that curved down past my hip and didn't allow normal underwear because it was sheer/mesh. Definitely follow the instructions because you have to put it on very carefully or it'll fall off throughout the night and be embarrassing which happened three times. When fully stuck on to you, there are absolutely NO underwear lines (see pictures before I got sweaty and it actually stuck on) I want to love this product but can't for the simple fact that it didn't stick fully throughout the night-obviously you're going to get sweaty at prom dancing and being around hundreds of people. This was where problems happened. It was just too much having to awkwardly press it down in the front while around other people-either that or have it sticking out like I have male parts. Maybe I misread or misunderstood but I feel like it should be expected that you'll get a little bit sweaty if you're dancing a lot or near a lot of other people, which is where you'd usually wear something revealing."
2.0,This scarf is cute and soft  but when I opened the package it smelled like nasty mildew! I washed it  and 75% of the fringe unraveled and the smell didn't 100% go away so now I have a scarf with a weird smell and uneven fringe :(
2.0,"It fit like a long-sleeved t-shirt. I'm 5'4"", 140 lbs, got a M. It's short.  I wore leggings underneath.  The material is thin and not very soft.  It's clingy. After washing the embroidery was wonky, mis-shaped. I washed it on delicate with Biokleen and hung to dry inside out. I kept pressing the stealie flat with my hands, but it got funky shaped, wavy. The stealie was lower on my dress than it shows in the seller's picture. It's like a big shield over my lady parts. It's a magnet for dog and cat hair.  It's plain black, the opposite of what to actually wear to shows and festivals.  It's the anti-tie-dye outfit. I won't wear it out again, but I'll wear it as pj's."
2.0,Not as substantial as presented
2.0,"The top was nice, but the pants weren't lined and actually see-through. They also fit tighter in the thighs than I would have liked."
2.0,I ordered a size down before my cruise for formal night and man the boob area is HUGE. I had to have my sister work some magic with some pins to get it to not flash everyone. I am a size D so I am not sure what size you would need to be covered! Sadly I had to tape everything to me and worry that is was going to come undone. The material and style is gorgeous but overall disappointed in how it fit
2.0,"The material is extremely thin. Other then that, I like the style, color, and the sellers customer service. They have some good quality pieces, but this isn’t one of them “for me”."
2.0,Too silky for the head with long hair.. won’t stay
2.0,Cute but comes off while they crawl
2.0,Extremely cheap. looked like it was made by a kindergarten student
2.0,If you want any type of compression or firm tummy control DO NOT SIZE UP IN THIS ITEM.
2.0,"The holes for the vent things was cut larger than necessary. Right out of the pack we had to keep putting the ventilators back in. We'd be in the store and it would just fall out and leave a giant hole in the side....<br /><br />And yes, we're aware they're not CV19 safe..."
2.0,"Had to return it - sizing was off, material looked and felt quite cheap."
2.0,"The quality of this set is not good. The shorts look horrible and fit very badly. They are slightly large for size, but the real issue is the quality of the fabric. The colors are also a huge issue! They are extremely bright and look different from the ones on the pictures. The top part is very long and will cover your bum if you do not tuck it in above and they you have a large part hanging down. It does NOT look cute like in the images, but simply ill fitting. A shame."
2.0,"Fits small for the size given.  Sigh.  I wish Asian countries who make these things understood that Americans are bigger and yes, fatter.  But we still want to wear nice clothes. Jeez."
2.0,Too small.  Order 2 sizes up.
2.0,"The bottoms were super tiny (and I don't have a full booty lol), and the top was super big for the bikini set"
2.0,fits tight with not a lot of give to maneuver the ways this could be worn
2.0,Did not like the flowers because they are too big for a head band the flowers are the size of flowers you would put in a vase!
2.0,very narrow fit.
2.0,"I'm always looking for a great pair of brown slip on shoes.  I was excited to find these at a great price here on Amazon.  They are indeed very nice looking, but they are not very comfortable.  They are quite narrow and required the additional purchase of insoles which only made them tighter.<br /><br />After just a few short months wearing them only a couple of times a week, I'm even more disappointed.  The front of the shoe is separating from the sole and I do not drag the front of my foot. See picture.  These do not spark joy, to channel my inner Marie Kondo."
2.0,"I took out the draw string but the Large size was way to tight at the waist. I wear about a 35 inch fit.<br /><br />Otherwise, they are okay."
2.0,"These are very thick, white on the inside and very short. Probably best fits a smallish woman or child."
2.0,For the size need their really wasn't any room in the armpit area.  Would have been very uncomfortable to sleep in.
2.0,Runs small. XL fits like a L.
2.0,ngl i’m pissed. I defiantly thought this top was gonna be wayyy longer than it was. It literally says LONGline in the description but maybe i’m just dumb and don’t know what that means. anyways this is what it looks like on with high waisted jeans. It’s super cute and fits well in the boobs i was just expecting it to be way longer and not so cropped. Material is amazing though and it’s very supportive of my DDD girls.
2.0,"I was able to enjoy these sunglasses for about 3 months before one of the arms broke off. The other side is cracked as well where they attach. Buyer beware, these are not made to last."
2.0,"The ""green"" top looks nothing like the photo. The actual color is more of a grey with a slight green hue"
2.0,"The spring bars seem fine.  The box is really terrible.  The box has zero closure mechanism, so it comes taped together.  When you remove the tape, the entire outer edge is covered in sticky residue.<br />The lid of the box has zero closure, no click into place, no pressure closure nothing.<br />So, here is a sticky box full of tiny objects whose top does not close.  It sticks to your fingers and jars the spring bars.  If you want to wipe the edges clean with something watch out if you jostle the box the lid gets ajar and the bars jump into the wrong slots.<br />the last straw was my forgetting how badly made it is and my trying to put the box into my coat pocket, the lid came off immediately and the bars spilled across their trays and into my pocket.<br />A new product should not require gunk removal upon arrival.  And any kind of functional box like this should have some kind of closure mechanism."
2.0,"The jumpsuit itself was very cute. I bought this to photograph weddings in. However, I ordered a medium, and received a large. Will be returning."
2.0,"The fabric was so stiff And cheaply made, so much shorter than I was expecting.. yes I knew it was a crop top but it literally could have fit my 5 year old. The design doesn't look like the picture but I still liked it"
2.0,"Sizing was weird, might be Asian sizing. I’m 5’2” and this was very short, just enough to cover backside, but the armpits of the dress were huge. I’m pretty petite and the waist fit fine, but usually mini dresses are longer on me, I would definitely wear spandex under this if you’re wearing it out. I bought this for my wedding rehearsal dinner and I ended up getting something else since I didn’t feel comfortable enough to wear this out. Sad since the back is so cute."
2.0,"I had ordered a similar blouse, but I'm disappointed in this one. Fabric is not as nice and the cut is boxy instead of flowing."
2.0,"Love the color and lenght of the dress, top of dress run a little small"
2.0,One of the clock hands was broken.  I did not make an attempt to return it.  Just didn't think it was worth going to the trouble for a 3.95 item.
2.0,Cute outfit. Very cheap material runs wayyyy too small.
2.0,"Super cute, but so small. I would order up a size or two if I were you."
2.0,"As you can see from my photo and other reviewers this watch case and band are black and white, not rose gold as advertised. It's still a good watch band but it's absolutely false advertising. Rose gold cases and bands are hard to find and I think the seller is banking on that. I reached out to them to get the correct color but all they gave me was a 50% refund. I don't think they actually have any rose gold cases or bands at all. As the potential buyer you deserve to know this information."
2.0,Good but not good for sensative ears
2.0,"Kids liked the style, but unfortunately two of them came apart at the seams after a couple uses."
2.0,Con: The Zipper at the bum broke 20 minutes after opening package.  Why they would put such a cheap zipper in this location is beyond me.<br /><br />Pro: The material is super soft.
2.0,"Really loved the design but if theres any liquid or ice pack, it leaks right through the fabric. Very thin"
2.0,It’s alright- I wasn’t impressed- it’s thats silky yet stretchy fabric - it was cheap and I got what I paid for so - meh
2.0,The product does not match the picture.  The picture looks more like the color of blue jeans but the t-shirt is actually very pale blue.
2.0,"Very cute ring, i bought it for my 10 year old. Unfortunately it broke after just 2 days."
2.0,These were just ok for the price. Didn't give off a lot of light in my centerpieces but the kids loved them.
2.0,Band broke cleanly in half after spending the night in my canvas shoulder bag. Everyone seems to have this problem. Not a very rugged watch if it does this. I didn't even remove the vinyl cover on the watch face yet!
2.0,"I super like the idea but it's a bit short and not enough to cover my bum.  Definitely a skinny girl skirt. The battery pack is exposed as well, not sure how I'm going to hide it. Oh well."
2.0,This was not size accurate. Far too big for a 3X. Even after it was washed.
2.0,Unfortunately I did not wear it. It is costume material.
2.0,Runs really small and very form fitting for a plus size dress
2.0,Although these seem to be well made and delivery was prompt; they do not fit and will have to be returned.
2.0,Mine broke about a month and a half after I got it.
2.0,"I ordered and did not get all the items I'm suppose to. I only received the dress, and the headband. I did not receive the apron which is a huge bummer considering I needed this costume for a Halloween themed work shift I have coming up. Now, I must find something else, or try to find an apron to go with the dress. It just doesn't look right as Alice without the white apron."
2.0,"First of all, It took too long to arrive. Secondly, the color doesn’t look close match like the picture. I ruined two sweaters because it get caught on my cuff of my sleeves! After two days of wearing it, there was a black strip on the center of the strap. I would not recommend to anyone. I went back to my old rubber strap."
2.0,I bought these because it said 2 pack. Only one showed up so I assumed it was a mistake on my part. Now that I am looking back on the order it clearly says 'Aegend 2 pack'. The product itself looks fine but I am not happy about only receiving one.
2.0,See the picture. This is how it came in a plastic bag. Going back because it's too small but wadded up like it's been used? Amazon can do better than that.
2.0,"I liked this band at first, but within a month it looked awful! The edges looked very worn after only a couple of weeks."
2.0,One of the jewls popped out. It smells really bad. The lights barely work. Very poor job wiring the lights. It's just loose wire that's supposed to be behind some foam pad.. But the pad fell off after 1st use. Now the inside of the glove is sticky from the crappy adhesive they used.
2.0,Sadly there was a hole in my top. Other than that it’s a cute top.
2.0,"It's tiny, and the metal is too soft, easy to bend.  I ordered the largest size and it barely goes over my first knuckle.  I'm afraid to stretch it out because it starts to warp the circle and might break.  Not at all what I'd expected."
2.0,Beautiful dress but my daughter is a 6 and it was way to small for her
2.0,Do not expect fur to look like picture because it comes flat and it does not puff up like it looks in picture.
2.0,"too small, cheaply made"
2.0,The color was pretty washed out and the quality wasn’t what I was looking for.
2.0,"This dress was longer, bigger, and heavier fabrics than I thought. Ordered a medium and it was way too big on me. I'm 5'8&#34; and 135lbs."
2.0,So comfortable but completely see through
2.0,Won't stay on my hair! I have several scarves but these won't stay on my head. Kept coming off.
2.0,"I think I read those first two reviews that appear to be written by the same person.  I bought three pairs of these pants because I thought they were really cute on line.  They are ""cute"" but extremely cheaply made.  I paid $30 for mine and the material is a cheap thin polyester like you get when you buy clothing overseas for huge discounts.  I am disappointed.  BUT I will wear them.  The pants ran small and they give me a slight camel toe but I will make it work."
2.0,"Nice belt, good price<br />Update: belt fell apart within a few months. I would have been better off spending more money and buying better quality. Once again I was lured in by a great price, and disappointed by a poor quality item. When will I ever learn?"
2.0,A great deal... If you like crotch holes in your leggings! You don't even need to wear them that many times. Crotch holes!! ;)
2.0,"Very fragile jewelry. The bar necklace was delivered broken. The leaves on the other set are very pliable and had sharp points that needed trimming. They are really pretty, but so delicate."
2.0,"I chose the black ankle length pants. The fit was about right, though I am tall and the pants don’t quite go below my calves. The material feels stiff, almost as if it’s been starched? I’ll wash them and update. My main disappointment was with the color. The pants I received are not the pants pictured. The black pants pictured are a worn almost gray-ish black. They look causal and trendy. The black pants I received are deep deep black, very formal looking and sort of like something my grandmother would wear. Not trendy at all.<br />I’m not going to return them bc I have very few options for pants (postpartum)... and they do fit. I’m hoping they soften as I wash them. And maybe I’ll dry them in the sun to get a different color?<br />Anyways- be ware... they are not the pants the model is pictured wearing."
2.0,We should have bought a 3x or 4x for my daughter who usually wears X large to 2x: this is not over sized like the picture shows :
2.0,"Loved it, until it broke while dancing the first day i wore it..."
2.0,"The lenses are too small, they look funny. I will not wear them."
2.0,"Alright, this watch band was adorable. I loved it. It felt well made and fairly study. However the elastics bites. I don’t have that large of hands. But after the second or third time of taking the watch on and off the elastic stretched too much. This caused my watch to slide around all over the place. Such a shame for something so cute!"
2.0,Quality is good but I recieved 2 different sizes! One 00 and one 0.
2.0,"The bracelet itself is satisfactory, you get what you pay for...I was pleases with the size as it is hard to find a bracelet that is actually infant size, my problem was that it arrived with a broken clasp, it arrived 4days before Christmas and was a gift so I had no choice but to keep it and replace the clasp myself."
2.0,"I thought it would be black, but it was blue. Rubber sole with cloth bootie. I'm not sure how long they will last. Was not as expected."
2.0,Item fit but it was lumpy. They tried packing it but it’s not that it was folding the quality itself was jusy not good. The padding was minimal and when wearing a shirt over you could see the lumps of the padding inside. I returned the item.
2.0,I purchased for my 2 year old however although they are adjustable I would say their more suitable for older kids. However they are still a good quality.
2.0,"I ordered the black and white polka dot version of this dress and the description was my exact same measurements. However, when the dress arrived it was so small I couldn't even button it up, which sucked because it was a really cute dress otherwise. I had to return it."
2.0,Did not help with night vision.  Everything appeared darker.
2.0,This hat was too big for me and not adjustable in the back
2.0,"But it just kind of was cut like a witches costume for Halloween. Needs some darts, or something - we are sexy women, we need to feel that way. It had potential, but even with a belt it just was meh.... someone please have a talk with the designers - we need to feel sexy - give us some shape."
2.0,Product not right fit. Too small didn't look like picture.. not happy at all.
2.0,"My daughter loves these boots and it fits perfectly but the smell that comes out of these is horrific.  It smells like these were made in a cigarette house!  Absolute horrible and strong.  Can’t seem to remove the odor.  We tried using baking powder, vinegar, and let us sit outside for weeks.  The odor isn’t as potent but it is still there."
2.0,Trying to return because what u get is not what is advertised 2 are no lace and one is lace...
2.0,"Rubber is too rigid, therefore brittle and spilts quickly after wearing a few times."
2.0,"I purchased the bracelet in mid Dec 2019 and immediately upon wearing, small stones started to fall off the bracelet. They are too small for me to find them once they fall off. Dismayed, I just stuck the bracelet in a drawer until today. I am unable to contact the seller as it is beyond the return period for the item.  It is a beautiful bracelet but I think some of the stone holes are drilled off center, more towards the edge of the stone, causing stones to fall off when you are handling or wearing the bracelet. The photo here shows there is at least an inch of missing stones and you can see from the sellers picture, the stones are snug, back to back, no gaps."
2.0,This was too wide to fit my Activitie Pop
2.0,"This is for pale skinned women, if you're even slightly tan or olive, I wouldn't get it... Also, doesn't really stay flat and can be seen through clothing."
2.0,"The dress looks different than I expected, mainly because of the look of the material. The material looks cheap and like costume material; is very shiny. Also, the dress did not fit and I got my correct size and according to the chart/ other reviews. I got a size 10 and usually wear 8/10, depending on the fit. I am 5'8 1/2"" tall and 160 pounds. I was not able to even get the dress over my hips, and surely couldn't pull it down from the top over my shoulders. I would say, if youre set on this dress then go even 2 sizes up."
2.0,The bottoms fit but not the top and I got both in an XL
2.0,Product arrived with a huge stain and I’m having a hard time trying to get the item replaced.
2.0,"They’re shiny… tight stretchy… weird pockets. Not my favorite, unfortunately….<br />And they’re thinner."
2.0,The fist day it broken. I have to fixed. So sad. I use only for two hrs.
2.0,"these are shown and listed as long sleeve-so I ordered them. They arrived and are short sleeve!!! I'm not returning them-as now they aren't even available, but am  not happy with short sleeves for winter!"
2.0,worked great for 6 months.  peels off after that.  not happy.
2.0,The interior of sock is very uncomfortable. There are rough areas on the metallic fibers at the seam above the toes and the excess fiber material feels like there is something in the socks that doesn't belong.
2.0,"Cute, size up twice. I’m a 10/12 and the XL was still too small. Wish it fit."
2.0,The bra was wayyyy to small
2.0,"They're not bad, but they run small."
2.0,Small. Thumb can't fit into it
2.0,"Front top button  is stitched  so flimsily,  it came off  the  first  time  I  put  it on...!  Does not come with a belt,  no  tears  so  far  but am forced to waer it withy my belt(since button came off so easily),  avoid this product,  best to stick to Walmart to buy shorts  in  my  opinion."
2.0,"Too small, and feel like womens cotton panties. I threw them away."
2.0,"I read the glitter reviews on these and just thought I could wash it. Been washed multiple times and still glitter. Worse than the reviews, I'll go so far to say dangerous. The glitter was on her eye lids and below her eyes and who's know what would happen if she got it in her eyes and I had to take her to urgent care. They need to fix this! I read the new vampirina was fixed. I have the Rapunzel one and there's no issue."
2.0,It wasn’t legible
2.0,This dress is cute but be warned that in this particular black fabric it WILL SHRINK mercilessly if put in the dryer. I never got to wear it because upon first wash and dry it now barely covers my butt. Disappointing.
2.0,"The angle of the photo was very deceiving. The color is much more iridescent and the cut of the toe is more blunt. I was so excited to receive these, and when I opened the box I was immediately disappointed. Not my style at all. Thankful for free returns!"
2.0,Granddaughter said smiley faces different & stitching on slippers inferior. Returning.
2.0,"Made for little girls not women, cheaply made"
2.0,is it even real? I don't want to hurt people business. so I just leave my comment in question.
2.0,It gets extremely cold in our territories. These gloves seemed like a good idea until I realized I couldn't fix or repair them myself. It turns out the battery pack is not impact resistant. I dropped a glove and it has not worked since. I would not recommend.
2.0,"They look nice enough but they are not well made.  The seams came apart quickly and the finger tips are too blunt to even unlock my phone, much less use it.  The gloves are of no use to me.  I only ended up wearing them a few times."
2.0,"I own a lot of Onex shoes that I love ... but this one, although beautiful, is not very comfortable at all ... My toes do not fit in this shoe and it's also hard to put on.  I returned this pair of shoes"
2.0,The material is really cheap and doesn't feel nice to the touch. Returning!
2.0,Product nothing like advertised. The DAD was almost indiscernible because it is white and it looks more like LED. Don’t wast your money. Not bad except that.
2.0,I got rid of it. I could see glue around the image as it met the metal and the closure on the chain irritated my neck. I was disappointed as I really wanted this image.
2.0,Material is scratchy and the fit was off
2.0,"I wish I could keep this dress but unfortunately it was way too short. It looks long on the model in pick but on me it was literally at the crotch. I'm average height at 5""4"
2.0,I wish I could return it. It looks like I'm wearing a diaper. :(
2.0,"I am 5'5, 140lb, ordered the Medium. I think the top is too big unless is just mine body shape.<br /><br />Also, I did not like AT ALL that the bottom is right below my belly bottom. I like them to be either high waisted or low. Not in the middle"
2.0,Cut not as shown and much wider
2.0,Not polarized.
2.0,"Pretty dress, great feel but a little too small and top half is a little to see through. Wish they had a xx large."
2.0,White was very see through and just not the right material for this type of shirt style.
2.0,it runs very small! very disappointed
2.0,Cute but no support. Runs a little small.
2.0,"I bought these for my son a while back. They are cute and a good value but 3 of the 6 bows were sewn incorrectly at the clasp which made them not adjustable and thus unwearable. Other than that, they were cute. I took the stitching out and re-sewed the 3 that were wrong but the task took me nearly 3 hours."
2.0,"This is black and looks tarnished in the spots where the &#34;leaves&#34; cross.  In the picture these look likes shadows, but in person you can easily see the black spots."
2.0,"This dress is paper thin! And short, no bending or raising arms in this dress! The pic makes it seem like the white isn’t shear, but it is!"
2.0,"I just received this and am extremely disappointed that although it is described as being adjustable, it's not! The back strap in elastic and has a clasp on it, however the ends of the strap are sewn into the fabric of the cap-not way to adjust the sizing. It's a shame too because the style, fabric, and color are all perfect. But I need to be able to make it smaller or it will fly off with the slightest breeze."
2.0,"Started wear and tear way to early for such a bad A backpack. 6 months started breaking, and I used it for regular use."
2.0,"cropped way shorter than i expected, well above the belly button, i returned it."
2.0,"This item arrived with the strap disconnected from the watch face.  We took it to a watch repair shop to fix, but I was disappointed in the delivery."
2.0,I purchased a large as most of my pants like this are large.  This is not the case here.  A large must be like a 14 or greater.  I am not sure if I will order a smaller size.
2.0,"I wanted these to work so badly. In some ways they did. They are very warm and the insole is very supportive. But, although they fit me well in the forefoot, the heel was a problem. It slipped with every step, but at the same time it gripped the sides of my heel, so I knew if I walked for longer than five minutes I'd have a blister going. The heel is not lined with the same fabric as the upper. The shearling is on the shaft only, but the lining in the upper is textured and warm, while tthe lining of the heel much smoother and so more prone to rubbing, I believe. Finally, they were so HEAVY! My knees are not up to heaving all that weight around. So, sadly, I had to pack them up (so much packaging) and send them back."
2.0,The Ram emblem was already disconnected from the key chain. Almost impossible to fix it right. Tried gluing the emblem back on but came apart again after a couple of days. I gave it two stars because it functions like its suppose to otherwise.
2.0,These socks were a very nice fit.  I wore them one time and one of the two socks lost the elastic at the top pretty quickly into wearing them.  It was quite disappointing.  The other sock fit perfectly.  I'm not sure what the problem was but one sock never fit correctly after one hour of wearing these.
2.0,Appears a little too ‘faux’ in person. Or maybe a little too plastic than faux leather! Color was also slightly off!
2.0,"Waaaay too small.  Ordered a 5X, normally wear 2x or 3X.  Very soft, but see-thru thin.  Shipping was very slow.  Very disappointed.  Would not buy again."
2.0,"Unfortunately, these over-sized glasses are not oversized at all.  They are quite small.  The finish is flat/dull.  This could have been a great pair of glasses had they had a glossy finish and if they actually were over-sized.  It was worth the effort to return them so they are in my sun-glass graveyard drawer.  Maybe you should drop the word &#34;Over-sized&#34; and tell everyone that they have a dull finish."
2.0,"The case is designed well to keep the Stadia controller stored however there is not much room to store anything in the case. orzly makes a phone controller mount to clip onto, but when trying to store the mount and controller in the case it does not fit as well. It would have been great to be able to store the mount and controller together in the same case."
2.0,"I was glad to have found a deadpool costume for my 10 month old, however it does fit small in the legs. It fits rather odd. If you have a 10 month old who fits into 12 month old clothing, then I would try the 12-24mo size. (I ordered the 9-12) all in all, the color is great."
2.0,broke the buckle in 3 months
2.0,Huge and not a comfortable fabric at all.
2.0,I ordered this one twice (returned one) but the print that is supposed to match the patterned sleeve was on the wrong side on both of them. My son decided to keep the second one because it was part of a halloween costume and I figured the whole batch was like that. I still don't understand how that happened and a quality control inspector didn't catch it before they were shipped out to the supplier.
2.0,Colors are more faded than picture and the 3x fit my boyfriend like a 1x
2.0,You can see through the fabric you get what you pay for
2.0,The colour is not gold. It's brown
2.0,Weird material. Not the super soft stretchy legging I expected. Actually they aren't very stretchy at all. And they sit weird on the waist. I guess they're okay for the price but just not very comfortable.
2.0,It felt great to the touch - but the gathers on the side made it uncomfortable for wear -  returned
2.0,"These are tights not leggings. They are shiny not matte but you can't see through them. I'm 5'5 and had to work really hard to get the groin area in place and I don't have thick thighs or a large rear end. Not what I was looking for, returned."
2.0,"I just received this dress today and it is NOT 100% cotton as advertised,  it is 65% cotton and 35% polyester, and feels like it is100% polyester---total synthetic plastic feel, and I kind of think it is even fraudulently labeled.  I will say, it did fit and look as described.  If it was in fact 100% cotton as described, or even if they made a 95% cotton, 5% elastane blend, it would have been great.  I'll be sending it back, and I hope they stop fraudulently advertising it as 100% cotton as that's the only reason I bought it. If I was ever able to find an actual 100% cotton version, or 95% cotton version, I would absolutely buy it, but we cannot have Amazon vendors blatently lying to us about what they are selling us. Even with free shipping and free returns, it's really not okay.  Amazon needs to address this."
2.0,"Way too big, not good for working out."
2.0,"So this item is BEAUTIFUL! BUT, if you have average or small wrists you will be disappointed as this will not fit snuggly enough for hour watch to detect that it is on a wrist 😞 broke my heart a little cause I really wanted this one! My wrists are average size, fit sizing in description and all. So be careful when buying!"
2.0,Super cute but some Fly London are super comfy and some hurt my feet. These fell into the latter category :-(.<br /> You need to try them on yourself to be sure.
2.0,I have to agree with another review on here about them being way too low and showing your bum. When I first opened these I was super excited they’re extremely beautiful color and supersoft I have thick legs and I was worried about them fitting but they slid on just fine that was until I got to my butt.  They were too loose in the stomach area and were about 2 to 3 inches shorter in the behind then they are on the stomach.  Because of this if I were to even bend over in the slightest my butt would hang out.  If these Were Highwaisted they would’ve been perfect.
2.0,Bad stitches.
2.0,The material is very thin. The black color has a blue tint to it and it seemed to be large in size for a small.<br />Definitely not a sweater like a regular hoody.
2.0,Beautiful idea however when we received it in the mail several of the flowers were not attached to the headband and hot glue fragment strings were hanging from the head dress.
2.0,"This dress ran big and isn’t flattering. There is extra fabric in places that make you look bigger; however, the fabric is beautiful and the dress is well made."
2.0,"When arrived, I try to fit the top, and zipper is busted, it closes but, it split right away. :( the pants it’s alright."
2.0,The first one I wore and it’s already looking like I’ve wore it for months. Not expecting for the rest to last either. It fits as expected.
2.0,This shirt was too short length wise on me and I am 5’9 I raised my arms just to shoulder height and my stomach showed.
2.0,The gems were coming off the dress and I’m disappointed
2.0,"Picture shows fitted leg, they are very wide, I sent them back."
2.0,Earring we’re as they appeared on Amazon. I was not able to wean in tragus area because neae the earing piece is bulky and it prevents the earing to go all the way through.
2.0,Fabric is chintzy. Ordered a 3x. I’m usually a large. In Asian sizes it fits.
2.0,"Cons:<br /><br />Not waterproof!<br /><br />Fairly cheap, threads coming undone and you can hear them snapping if you stretch too far.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Looks really good on my legs. 👌 Just like the photo."
2.0,FEELS LIKE IM WEARING A BAD TABLE CLOTH
2.0,"Took some time to get from china. At first I liked the shape and the frame and especially the long temples. But after wearing for some time I discovered a big negative - the lens height is very small and since this is a bifocal lens, any slight movement of the eye down goes into the magnifying zone and is very uncomfortable. I had to look straight up to not bump into the magnifier. This became unbearable to view through that I stopped using them after just one day."
2.0,The band continues to come unfastened & I have almost lost my Gear Fit2 Pro on several occasions. If wearing long sleeves I have to keep my watch in my sleeve or check my wrist constantly if wearing short sleeves.
2.0,"The print is on both the front and the back of this mask. That’s not terrible, but I would prefer for the back to be solid black. More importantly, the pic they have shows the bottom of the mask to be wider. It’s actually just a long cloth cylinder. It feels like it’s choking me at the neck."
2.0,"These shorts are good, but after 6 months the inserts are all bunched up making them unusable. I see others have had this same problem, but I guess for the price they were ok. Since they are so popular I have noticed the price has increased so I will probably be trying another cheaper brand. If they only last 6 months why pay more than you have to."
2.0,Too big for my 2 year old.
2.0,Got this thinking it would fit my Zen Sleek Photo player but it is too small.  The rubber has already ripped while trying to stretch this over the player.<br /><br />The armband is ok.
2.0,galoshes with cleats. Not sure such a word exist in English. Something like &#34;rubber shoes&#34; with cleats...
2.0,"Arrived quickly. Love the belt, however l wore it once and had a horseshoe fell off. Disappointed with the quality. Will not be ordering from this seller again."
2.0,"I ordered this sweater in 2 colors hoping to have some winter staples, but when they arrived they are HUGE. Ordered a Small in each and they have these awkward sleeves with too much fabric and the body is like a giant bag. Super sad to return them because they are so cute pictured. I am 5' with a medium build."
2.0,Came apart within two weeks.
2.0,The print is faded as if it was already worn. I can see the tshirt through the ink on the logos.
2.0,"These are lovely yoga pants but I have no clue on how they would be considered warm.  I've owned fleeced lined ""warm"" pants before and they have a nice thick fleece lining.  This is a very thin lining and would work fine for a fall day or in an area that doesn't get below 32 F but I do not consider them  ""warm winter"" pants."
2.0,The glasses were great until the frame broke after a little more than one month.  These are not made very well.
2.0,Didn't like the drawings of the Beatles. Doesn't look anything like them. Very poor drawings of their hands. Wish it just said The Beatles without having the drawings that don't look like them on the shirt. Couldn't tell when ordering that they would look so strange.
2.0,Bought a large (I’m a 10-12). Way too small. Returned and bought XL: fits but poorly
2.0,"I've always bought large for my grandson, but this shirt was super large."
2.0,"I bought 2 sizes too lage, and they are still snug."
2.0,"The quality looks good, but the top is much shorter than pictured, and overall the the sizing is probably two steps down. I.e. L most likely fits S person."
2.0,The most dislike about this item was the material and not so great for mans style.<br />The size also was more or less for Ladies .<br />For this I guess I can just keep it for me ?.
2.0,This shawl was pretty but it had a major tendency to shed. Had to return as it would have made my dark colored evening gown furry.
2.0,"This dress has the potential of being really cute.  I was looking for a packable dress to take to Europe.  The fabric is soft and not bulky, also not see-through so I wouldn't need a slip.  For reference I'm 5'3&#34;, 128lb, 32DD, and typically wear XS-S in Gap dresses, and a size 2-4 in other dresses, and I think this dress runs a bit large in the waist, but the bust and hips were fine, not tight at all.  The skirt came wrinkled so I don't know that it would have looked good right out of the suitcase, but the material is such that I think in time the wrinkles would ease up.  What broke the deal for me is the uneven stitching around the waist (see pictures).  It made the dress look quite cheap and I will return it."
2.0,Very pretty but it faded fast
2.0,"The necklace was very pretty right up the giftees alley, however it came put together all ""wonky"" and was very cheaply made. Too late to change the order so may girl said she would take it apart and put it back together. Not a happy experience!"
2.0,The end piece holding the ball fell off causing the keys to fly everywhere.  Apparently the seller only glues the end pieces on but don't expect it to go the distance.
2.0,"Unfortunately the measurements for this romper are completely off. I ordered a size medium and I was swimming in it. For reference: I’m 5’2, 138lbs, 34ddd. The seem that is supposed to hit under the chest hits in the middle. The fabric above the seam is minimal and the waist is gigantic. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I own a few watches that require movement to charge. This device allowed them to be in regular motion where I don’t have to daily check on and service them manually.<br />Product came with all advertised accessories, operation manual and operates as advertised. However, I’ve only had it for a couple of weeks and it’s warranty is two years.

2.0,The leather obviously is not real so taking it on and off will wear the fake leather down also the underside of the watch band is rubber so it still leaves your wrist and watch band smelling nasty
2.0,TOO BIG! Wouldn't stay on my wrist.
2.0,I used the chart but it was WAY off! Had to return.
2.0,The stitching was loose and thready
2.0,I did not like the fit.  It also appeared that what I received was a return by the way it was packaged.  I returned it.
2.0,Calve too small
2.0,"Not happy.  Fits great, my daughter loved them for all of 3 weeks.  After 3 weeks the lights worked intermittently.  Then one shoe would not turn off."
2.0,The shirt is marketed as womens however the small might fit a 4 year old! My daughter was disappointed! The shirt is cute!
2.0,"this sandal was recommend for people with plantar fasciitis  - considering the price, i thought these would be decent. i wear an 8.5 and because the shoes do not come in 1/2 sizes i went  up to a 9. the size wasn't to bad but the width of the shoe was very WIDE. there's a chance a size down might help in the width, but would be to short. will be returning."
2.0,The material is very thin and will show any bump if you have them.
2.0,did not wash well
2.0,I really wanted to like this product but the fit is weird. Loose around the boobs and I don't feel the support very well.
2.0,Bought these for my son for sailing camp. He had blisters from them and they stunk soo bad after just one use
2.0,Seems are all frayed and the string to tie it together at the top was falling off.
2.0,Cheaply made so not worth it!!!<br />Never order here again!<br />Nothing like pictures!🤮🥵😵
2.0,I went according to the measurement for the size but they were much larger than stated.
2.0,It looked cool and was kinda cool but it was almost like costume jewelery which isn't what I wanted.
2.0,Was very pretty but really short so if your talk I would not recommend!
2.0,Tarnished and turned brown within a month.<br />Greatly inferior product. Don't Buy.
2.0,The cup isn't what I'm used to. If you're a 36DD in VS this bra will be too small
2.0,Very cheaply made. But for the price I guess you get what you pay for
2.0,"The hearts are very small, and the piercing stick is very long if used alone. Hearts hurt me the second day!"
2.0,The print is cute but they are really small
2.0,I bought a 5xl.Love the look and the material but for a person who is busty like myself (40h/I) it will not fit as expected. It runs really small
2.0,"The earrings are beautiful. I slept, showered, and did hot yoga in them, and they didn’t turn. That’s why I have 2 stars. 2 months to the day the backing slipped and got too tight, I went to pull it back, and the post came off. The earrings are no longer available, so I can’t contact anyone about this problem."
2.0,"well the price of this watch is 23 dollars, but it is better to add extra and buy better product"
2.0,The print is the perfect size for the shirt but I'm very tall and the 2XL fits like a large. WAY too small.
2.0,I was looking for a wool one but this served the purpose.
2.0,This is not the same fairy I orderd and the colors are dull looking on the one I received. Don't like it.
2.0,"Ordered a size up in the waist after reading reviews- running small is common. Note that the &#34;navy&#34; color is green with blue threds interwoven- actualy quite noce, but not navy blue. The fabric is a wool/cotton/stuff blend and only 38% wool with a half lining. For the price, one would expect full lining and an 60+% wool blend with some synthetic fiber for strength."
2.0,This looks cheap in person. Much better in the picture. Runs very small
2.0,"The pendant is quite nice, but the chain is of such poor quality it broke the very first day. Flimsy is an understatement. However, you get what you pay for. We are getting a better chain for it and keep it instead of returning it."
2.0,Thickness fine
2.0,Top is tiny. Bottom is perfect. Back to buying them separate I guess.
2.0,Way large!
2.0,Received and never gave it as a gift because the quality is cheap
2.0,"This dress is cheaply made. It is too small in the bust, waist and the length. I do not recommend."
2.0,"very cheap looking for gold, feels cheap."
2.0,"It’s a very very beautiful septum ring! But sadly it was very uncomfortable to wear. Since it is a straight bar instead of a round clicker, it makes very limited room for the piercing to move and if it does move, it hurts terribly. But it is so beautiful"
2.0,I did not like the fact that the watch band looked very cheap and also poorly crafted had it on for probably two months maybe less and it is already starting to stretch I think I paid $31 so not worth it
2.0,Arrived with broken pieces
2.0,These are awful shoes for babies. Firstly it doesn't fit well at all. One of the shoes fall off baby's feet on first day itself while he was in stroller. Baby is also not comfortable to walk in the shoes. Do not recommend at all.<br /><br />Update a month after original review posted... Customer care was pretty quick to respond on this review and they have kindly refunded for the shoe. I have communicated some design changes to them and hope they implement it further in design.
2.0,Couple of the necklaces were broken.
2.0,Not pretty like what is shown on Amazon.  The hats I received did not have the pretty colorful chiffon ribbons and flowers as shown on Amazon.  Instead they are a tan color and the overall hat is more tan then the pastel color.  The hat is also a bit small on my 5 year old. These are going back.
2.0,Purse didn't look like the picture.  Very small and made for a teenager.  I was very disappointed.
2.0,Did not come in navy was a very odd blue color. Fit well but very disappointed in the color.
2.0,Would be a cute hat but there’s 2 very noticeable fold lines on the bill of the visor. I’ve tried laying it between 2 books for a week then ironing it out but no luck. It looks totally lopsided and funny when you put it on. Will be returning.
2.0,34C/36B size 28 jeans ordered size medium. Fabric on the top is really small and you have to use the cup inserts to keep the fabric stretched out to prevent nip slip. Didn’t look how I imagined and not sure if getting a large would have given the coverage needed. Bottoms are somewhat small but they’re pretty much a thong so it doesn’t matter
2.0,Shirt ran too small
2.0,I returned this item due to size issues.  It looks small but is a larger women's watch.  I have very small wrists and hands it just didn't work.  I could slip it over my hand and then it flopped around on my wrist.<br /><br />I would recommend this watch for a woman with a larger wrist.  Mine is small and most watches have to have links removed to fit.
2.0,Tooo much fabric!! It makes the skirt fold in an unnatural way when wearing. I felt shapeless and like I was wearing a paperbag. I ordered a small and it felt more like a large.
2.0,"Hats are too small.  They are Asian Size.  These hats won't fit around my head as I want to wear the hat like a headband that covers my ears.  I wear visors in the swimming pool and need to cover my hearing aids so they won't get wet.  If your buying this hat to cover your ears, don't bother.  These hats will be too small."
2.0,but turned green very quickly and won't clean up. Waste of money. In the future will spend a little more.
2.0,"I am not necessarily unhappy with the belt (so far) but it shouldn't be allowed to be advertised as leather.. I can literally hear myself moving around.  The belt makes noise, and it definitely feels like plastic in my opinion.  It looks like the picture and holds my pants up, but it's not leather."
2.0,I would have liked these but the cheap material irritates my ears. now i know better to buy higher quality
2.0,Ties come off easily
2.0,The design and fabric of this mask are good. However the size is way to small. It looks like a child's mask. I compared it to another mask I just purchased and it a full 1 1/2 inches narrower. Not at all what I pictured. Won't be wearing it!!!
2.0,This shirt fits weird and mine is not long.  Boxey at top one shoulder falls off.  Also white very see thru7
2.0,"Very large on the sides. I suppose I expected that, but it was too big of a hole for me. I returned it."
2.0,"Great novelty gift for any Lord of the Rings fan. On first touch, the ring feels rugged and catches on your fingertips. Upon closer inspection, the inscribed Black Speech in Tengwar creates a static cling, similar to laundry coming off the dryer and sticking to your hand. It's not noticeable when you have it on but you can feel it when you run your finger over the inscription. It does seem a little bit narrow for my taste but it fits true to size. I am happy with my gift.<br /><br />Update - after wearing it for about two weeks, the inscription caused me some skin irritation. The engraving does get caught up on things, skin included, and eventually it will cause discomfort. I am now looking for another ring but with a coating to prevent this issue from happening again."
2.0,Way too tight for my big head!! Well made so may work for someone with a smaller head.
2.0,Pockets made me look like I had man boobs. Fits a little small. Wrinkled when I received it.
2.0,"It’s cute. But the zipper on the side was a dumb idea. It’s always snagging on my shirts and now I have holes in my shirt I wore with it today. 😑<br />I took the shirt off an opted for my sports bra since I was just at home and the zipper snagged on my SKIN.<br />Now I have a hole on my side. 🙃 I should have been more careful and less hasty while undressing but, 2 Starbucks later nature called."
2.0,"Ended up returning this skirt because it was outrageously see through, there was no liner, and the pockets could be seen through ths skirt material. I do not think even wearing a slip underneath would make this skirt usable. I do not recommend you buy this"
2.0,One side completely broke off the stud. Hard to get on and off the ear without pulling on the earring while it's in the hole. Very pretty though.
2.0,somewhat small...too tight...gave them away...not as expected
2.0,The shirt was not as loose around the belly and the sleeves were way to long for me. The material ans pattern were as described.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:b6be6d9eafa1a71f93f84a62d1de3733]] The shirt itself was really cute so I got a medium. I can’t lift my arms in this shirt, it’s a lot shorter than it is in the photo. It’s cute but I’m really unhappy that I can’t wear it anywhere. Gonna keep it but get a size larger than you normally would if you got big b00bs like me 😂"
2.0,These shoes were much smaller than expected and we had to return them.  The outer shell was flimsy and likely wouldn't have supported a toddler foot well.
2.0,"Cute glasses, but one pair arrived missing a screw, and the other two were scratched badly in an hour or so of normal wear.  I've had them for 4 days and they're all unusable."
2.0,"This thing is made for a toddler. I’m very thin, ordered a medium, and it fits my 4 year old niece better. Pretty soft though."
2.0,Very thin material not sure what it’s suppose to protect from or if it’s for looks. But I purchased it with the hope to help with drooling & not getting his clothes wet or messy.
2.0,"I liked this top - it is decently made for the price, but it is too small.  I ordered an XL and i usually wear a medium top.  I just wanted a really loose  summer top - I can't leave the house in this."
2.0,"Fits too small, item was damaged (unraveled at bottom of shirt)."
2.0,"I ordered this bra thinking it was padded (I confused this with a similar La Isla bra:[[ASIN:B00OL935V2 La Isla Women's Full Coverage Wire Free Molded Cup X-back Lightweight Sports Bra Black 38D]].  I ordered a size up, as so many La Isla sports bra reviewers have suggested.  I wear a 38D, 38Dd or 40D, depending on brand.  While the 42D fit, it was a bit large on me - not as supportive as I would have liked and I hated the fact that it wasn't padded for modesty's sake (it showed high beams, ladies!)  Returned, will continue to look for another style with padding in 40D."
2.0,"The colors are great, but the it's over a foot shorter than the 75&#34; description and it drapes nothing like the picture provided. I was looking for an oversized flannel scarf and this was not it. Sold it to a coworker."
2.0,I got a duplicate of the first book and no tenth book
2.0,"still have a slight halo effect on the right edge of my screen, aluminum crown seems to interfere with the sensitivity of my stylus. Glass is nice, but for the cost I regret not just getting a premium film protector. Have had it on about a month so far. I verified the crown was causing my stylus issues by removing the crown when I noticed I was having problems."
2.0,Well made but WAT TOOOOOO SMALL!!!!
2.0,Doesn't match the size indicated and not corduroy..
2.0,The shirt was way too big and I sent it back for a refund. I would have liked the shirt otherwise!
2.0,This slipper started to unglue from soals 1 week after receiving.... other hand comfy and cute so glue them back but disappointed
2.0,"I loved these pajamas when they arrived. Personally the &#34;paper&#34; feel that everyone mentions on here actually feels comfortable and cool (temperature wise)  to me.  The colors and designs were nice too.  The product was also a lot cheaper then it currently is listed now (17.99 for 3).  The only reason these pajamas dropped to a 2 star rating so quickly was their quality.  One pair the crotch ripped within the first couple hours of wearing them, and now a second pair ripped 30 days later.  If you happen to stretch the wrong way, the material is not good at holding up at all.  Its kind of a bummer because once the rip starts its only a matter of time before it becomes unwearable.  Definitely one of those products that I was so excited about, until they had to stand up to use.  The price seemed worth it, ,but now I feel ripped off.  At least I have one pair left (for now)."
2.0,Didn’t like the way the material hung on the body
2.0,This shirt was poorly made and does not fit at all as expected.
2.0,This top runs very big. Otherwise it is a great looking top.
2.0,It didn’t fit me well.
2.0,"This top is more orange/red, not true red and it is too short."
2.0,these socks are nice for not being too thick and the colors are very nice but they stretched out when wearing them and became uncomfortable .I would not purchase again
2.0,"The body part of it fit okay but the boob area was huge and very far apart, probably would work if you have a large chest?"
2.0,I bought this dress before and the medium was perfect.  When I bought this dress it was too big. The sizes vary
2.0,"Love it when I first got the bracelet, but then it broke about the second day. Now it just hangs on my alter. Can't wear it. Probably should've been braided without the other two side ropes"
2.0,Eyes were dotted off.
2.0,"The product was beautiful and looked exactly as pictured. I had ordered 2. It fit and was comfortable. However, it was not useable. It had a very strong chemical odor that I didn’t want to put on my face and breathe in. Unfortunately they had to be disposed. Please look into this..."
2.0,So these gloves may work for those balmy Florida winters but not denver.... It seems that my hands are colder when wearing them. As for the fit its sub par at best. They have a stupid slit in the wrist that renders them useless in anything other than a wide cuff pea coat.. Save your money.
2.0,"BUT even then, I feel like these are definitely CENTS worth to make and put together. Clearly crudely made. Would've returned, but they fell off easily and with no indications from how light and papery they are."
2.0,"I am revising my original review of this product. Originally I thought that this underwear looked and felt good for the price. However, after a couple washes I found out that the material shrunk a lot. I am bringing it back to 2 stars."
2.0,"The color is deceiving. I originally bought this because the color was very attractive. However, once received it was very dull almos used appearing."
2.0,Shorts are way too small even after I ordered up a size (usually a L and ordered a XL).
2.0,"Very,  delicate,  pretty. Broke within 3 weeks. Never found it,  but thankfully found the diamond pendant I had worn it with."
2.0,I bought the &#34;black/black&#34; loafer. The canvas is definitely not black and clashes with the black sole. Color is more ambiguously brownish.
2.0,Very thin almost see through material. I wear a 2x it said it runs small so I ordered a 3x and shirt is very tight.
2.0,"The dress is beautiful. But the chart sizing is not correct. Size down if you order this. There was so much space in the bust area, you could see breasts from the top and the side due to the extra fabric sagging."
2.0,"Cute, but THIN. There is no lining at all, it's just a single thin piece of cotton T-shirt material. It'll stand no chance against baby drool, spit-up, food spills, etc. More like a cute accessory."
2.0,"El diseño lindo.<br />No son de gran calidad, se rompieron fácilmente...."
2.0,I have a style that has rubber tip that slides on end of ear piece.  I didnt like these from Amazon at all.  They are braided which was okay.  They are shorter than Im used to.  The real problem for me was tips.  The tips slid into my glasses where they fold.  I ended up giving these to a friend that uses a rubber band.  I kept 1 for emergency.
2.0,"Isn’t what I expected, do not like the looks of it."
2.0,"I ordered this shirt in medium (I normally wear an 8 petite.) In its favor, it is well tailored and a nice dark navy blue color.  However, it feels more like a lightweight canvas than like flannel. I was expecting, especially at this price, a flannel comparable to my flannel from LL Bean or Lands End.  This shirt is not soft, even after washing.  In addition, after washing, the sleeves that were a little long, because I'm a petite and have short arms, now fit perfectly. In other words, the shirt shrunk in sleeve length (and overall length).  I'm sure it shrunk a little around, but not noticeably. In addition, it needs ironing because the relatively stiff fabric wrinkled badly. It does not have the chest pocket shown in the picture. I am keeping it because solid color over-shirts are hard to find and because I have washed it.  Just be aware that you are not getting true &#34;flannel&#34; and it will shrink."
2.0,Not a flattering fit. Looks like crap after one wash. Not worth $16.
2.0,"So cute in picture, odd sizing. Fit around my waist was close to a US 12, but was completely oversized in top like a US 16-18 and too small around neck. I will re-sew and see if that will fix it."
2.0,I was so excited to order this for my mom for Christmas because we often say that to one another.  I got it and it and you can't even see the writing on it.  I was very disappointed in the item and will not be ordering anything from Bellrela again.  Sad you couldn't see the writing because the necklace itself is very pretty
2.0,I do believe this bracelet works but the metal ball at the end of the drawstring came off and the drawstring slipped out of the ring and now I cannot get it back in :(
2.0,I loved this band when I purchased it. I was REALLY disappointed that after a week the print on the band wore off.
2.0,Made small xlarge shirt fits tight
2.0,"Really cute colors, the top was great but the bottoms ran a too small so we had to return this item"
2.0,"Fit well but holy moly, is this material thin. As in, I could feel my three-day leg stubble through this dress. Just so cheap and crappy material. Save yourself the trouble."
2.0,"These are very cute but small.<br />The silver is soft and thin. It bends easily.<br />I was able to bend it back but it lost a stone.<br />If you treat them very gently, they are fine."
2.0,"The item description says these adorable little rose buds were to be used as charms for jewelry, but only after a month of use, mine have started to lose their vibrant color ans fall apart-- a rapid deterioration the epoxy barely saves them from. I looked at one today, and not only are the petals falling off, but the vibrant, pink-purpleish color arrived with is now a dark purple, almost brown around the base. Epoxy resin has been an amazing solution for arts and crafts, but I don't think these flower buds should be marketed and sold as charms for almost $8 dollars a pack if they're going to fall apart this quickly. Selling them at a lower price, and with a better description of their best use would have made a difference in my expectations."
2.0,"this has a thick elastic waist band that gathers all the extra material and leaves it very unflattering around the front below the waist. Maybe it'd look better on someone shorter, but the bottom part will be baggy."
2.0,Both pairs that I ordered were incorrectly labeled as to size. So I ended up with sandals that were too small both times. The toes that could fit into a part of the sandal &#34;messaged&#34; me that the sandal had potential.
2.0,I am a women's size 9(men's 7) and these socks are very tight. I don't have big ankles and my calves are normal size but these socks are so tight the almost cut off my circulation.
2.0,What I thought was a great product turned out to be a poor choice. The gowns are soft and comfortable but after 2 washings they are falling apart. I did not realize I purchased disposable gowns I guess. 😒
2.0,Agree with other reviewer about sizing being off. I ordered size 2 and they match up exactly with my other universal thread size 4’s.<br />*Update* After one washing these shorts are falling apart. Fray strings are constantly pulling out as I walk. These shorts won’t last more then a few wears. My universal threads I bought directly from Target have been washed several times and still look brand new.
2.0,"The wings arrived intact, but the end of the tail was broken."
2.0,"There are so many pockets! The pocket in the back does not go the length of the bag, but it is great for a wallet or something small. I love the hidden pocket in the strap, the sunglasses strap, the water bottle pockets.. pockets..so many pockets for all my needs. I really like the large metal zippers, most things have small zippers and I have big hands so this is great! I needed something to carry around daily and this fits the bill. The only complaint I have is that the strap is not long enough to go cross boy. But I definitely recommend!<br /><br />Update- the strap broke 2 miles into a 4 mile hike. I was not doing anything rough, only wearing it on my back. It literally just broke as I was walking. I didn’t have it over stuffed either! Just a water bottle, keys and snacks. Extremely disappointed since this WAS the perfect bag."
2.0,very scratchy
2.0,Se reventó cuando me la estaba poniendo
2.0,"Cute cute and color, but the fabric is stiff. I thought it just needed washed a few times, but it has actually gotten worse with each wash."
2.0,too big and flowy - I feel like I am in a mumu.  Just huge almost maternity style.
2.0,"I wanted to love this but the second time I wore it the material ripped out! It fit well at first but stretched out a lot so when I pit it on the second time it was loose. I looked in the mirror and the perforations in the cream colored fabric had started to rip. I am returning it now, it's way to expensive to be one time use!"
2.0,The earrings look great but they're so difficult to clasp that I hardly wear them. They're also a little heavy too.
2.0,"Loved everything about these pants except that in white, they show every bump and dimple in my legs. Do not buy these if you have even a hint of cellulite."
2.0,Arrived broken in 3 pieces. Had to get rid of 3 skulls and use pliers to make it work out. Seems cheaply made for the price paid.
2.0,The seem of she shoe is coming apart in less than a month
2.0,The clips kept falling off my fitbit was afraid I would loose the fit bit.
2.0,I did not like the fit.
2.0,"The waist is really high, more like a baby doll fit. Fit was very awkward but the fabric was nice"
2.0,This belt is too heavy and bulky. I was hoping for a light weight belt so was disappointed in this one.
2.0,Showed glitter and there isn't any just fabric. Disappointed
2.0,"I really liked this design, but  this hoodie had the tag cut off so I couldn't verify the size.  It seemed a little snug when I tried it on.  There was also long loose thread everywhere.  it was supposed to be a gift, but I have to return it.  It looked new, but with tag cut off, who knows!  I'm disappointed."
2.0,the lace seems to begin to break in the front and this was only after 1 washing.
2.0,This shirt shrunk from a XXL to a L. My 19 yr old daughter loves it....
2.0,"I am a 16 in US sizes. I followed the size chart with my measurements, and it fit horribly. The shoulders were about big enough for my 9 year old niece, and my bust would’ve needed to be at my collarbone for this to fit. I couldn’t even zip it up. The lace is pretty, but it’s disappointing as a whole."
2.0,Pictures were half the size as described in the buyers photos. Everything worked as it should but you can barely see the photos. If they were the size  the Pictures show I'd give it 5 stars.
2.0,THE FIRST SHIRT I ORDERED WAS TO SMALL. ORDEREDXL AND GOT LARGE INSTEAD. NO PROBLEM WITH RETURN. GOT THE SECOND SHIRT EARLIER THAN PROMISED WHICH WAS EXTREMELY NICE.<br />THE SECOND SHIRT STARTED PEELING BADLY  AFTER TWO WEARS AND ONE WASH. WASHED ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS. NEVER HAD A SHIRT DO THIS BEFORE. THE PRINT LOOKED GREAT AT FIRST. LOST 10 -15% AFTER THE FIRST WASH. RETURNED IT WITH NO PROBLEM. KUDOS FOR THAT. WILL NOT BUY THIS TYPE AGAIN.
2.0,These are very cute but they are a thick velvety material and I know my face would sweat so much after a few minutes. Will be returning. It also had a weird smell that I hope would go away after they were washed.
2.0,These are not stretchy enough to work well. I got these for my 5 and 9 year old’s to wear as face masks during COVID. We barely used them because they were very difficult to get over their heads. Once over their heads they were too loose to fit snugly over their noses. Overall they were just not stretchy enough to work.
2.0,Don't like the .material and it's also a little darker than the image. The material is a satiny thick slipper one and it's difficult to breathe through.
2.0,"Cheap materials. Looked good, but fit horribly."
2.0,"Cute top, but runs a few sizes too small, also had a terrible smell to it."
2.0,Arch is not rigid enough and collapses under weight. Will have to go back to another product.
2.0,sizing inaccurate. they are mens size. not soft but light.
2.0,Just an overall cheap product. Smells funny. It’s for Halloween...
2.0,"I buy almost exclusively Reef sandals because they're comfortable and they tend to last a long time. Not so with these sandals. First of all, the break in period for was much longer than for other models from this brand. This is mostly to be expected as they're partly leather. My primary gripe is that they have not worn well at all. Both the leather footbed and the tread quickly began to delaminate from the foam sole, and just as quickly that foam sole crushed so flat as to be practically nonexistent- it's like walking around barefoot. This is the only pair of Reefs I've ever been unhappy with, so I'll buy another model once these are done, which won't take much longer."
2.0,Marginal increase in range. Not recommended.
2.0,Since this is a product review I wanted to give me thoughts before I contact the seller. The baby Tee is ok cut more like a 12 mos old than someone who would wear a 12-18 mos. No way an 18 mos. old will fit in this unless they are very small. The shirt I got for my daughter is an XL and she normally wears a Large. The shirt is more like a childs XL or adult Small.There is no way my daughter is going to fit into this shirt which is unfortunate because the concept was adorable and for $16 total I would expect a better quality and fit more to size requested. Like the idea but hate that the sizes run very very small on this.
2.0,The face was nothing like pictured and the packaging was terrible. Is not worth it for the price.
2.0,"I liked the look, I liked the price.  I bought the shirt.  OH my...its got a sheen or a glimmer thoughout.  Yikes!!!  Will not wear."
2.0,"Super disappointed with this item. It fit well across shoulders and the sleeve length was perfect. However, the overall length of the garment was ridiculously short. Nothing like the length shown in the picture. I wish I had read the reviews before ordering as this appears to be an issue across the board."
2.0,"the picture looks like the shirt is made of cotton, however it is not...."
2.0,Fell apart after only a few months of use.
2.0,"It was smaller than I had thought, and the zippers were not too good. It does have a lot of pockets though."
2.0,It had too small of arms but fine in the chest
2.0,"The light DOES NOT stay in the hat , the light should sit and fit snug, it is loose?? Unable to wear? How do you expect someone to wear??"
2.0,It was a nice thick material and made with pretty good quality. It was just a bit small and too provocative for the occasion I planned to wear it to.
2.0,Nice and soft. But too small.
2.0,"Just simply not what I was expecting.  It is a lot larger and not very petite.  At the same time, I could see were some people would like it."
2.0,The hole is too narrow
2.0,Cute. Wrinkly though and material is slightly weird.<br />I’m 5’6’’ 134 lbs. small fit but could probably fit in a medium too.<br /><br />Update: after washing itt once and letting it air dry it shrunk like 3 inches! It’s now way above my ankles. Bummer.
2.0,Very tight bust
2.0,Hard to use the fingerprint scanner and magnetic closure strap needs to be just a bit longer.  Hard to close with cards on inside.  Impossible to keep closed with cards on the outside.
2.0,Hole in pocket
2.0,"These boots should never be advertised as wide calf.  Do not waste your money on shipping charges or ordering.  These boots are in no way any wider than any other boots in a regular store.  Just because the top inch of boots are made of a sweater material to stretch does not make the rest of the boots stretch over the calf.  Very, very disappointing!!!!!!"
2.0,Always wear a medium in clothes. This is short in length and tight around the arms. Will be returning. You can get a cheaper and better fitting shirt with Amazon’s Essentials shirts.
2.0,"not what I thought I ordered and was not a long chain. I will not wear, waste of money"
2.0,"Loved the color and the top of this swimsuit.  The bottoms were very cut in in the back, which you can't tell from the pictures posted. I returned this suit because of the skimpy bottoms."
2.0,My son loved them but they did not last more then 2 months before starting to tear on side. Unfortunately quality not good enough to withstand a toddler.
2.0,It looks very (extremely) cheap. The arms are VERY tight and it looks like a cape. Does not fall like the picture. I sent it back.
2.0,The way to put it on through neck opening is too small.
2.0,Very thin not what I Expected
2.0,Really liked them until the left one fell apart
2.0,OT doesn't sit right on my head...I keep pulling it down in the  hopes that it will sit correctly. No such luck. The fabric has zero give. Shame too....I wanted to love it!
2.0,"I like the color but the quality wasn't good, it's true to size, but the material wasn't good at all. I'm stuck with it because the return window close on it."
2.0,4x doesn't fit & I don't think 5x will either. To tight
2.0,"This is a cute top for the original price of $10 with free shipping.<br /><br />I bought the white one when it was reasonably priced in a size small.<br />It’s cute, the material is a bit thin and if you buy a small, I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone with anything over a B cup as the buttons will gape.<br />The material is soft, but you can tell it’s a bit cheap so please don’t buy this for $20.<br /><br />TBH $10 was a bit much, but I swear you will end up ugly crying , shaking your fists and cursing the heavens if you let yourself be bamboozled into paying over $10 with shipping for this thing."
2.0,"It keeps snagging on items when i read reviews,  that it would do that. And even the seller said wouldn't snag and its snagged a few of my nice tops.<br /><br />Update<br /><br />After wearing the band for just over a mont. I cant say it has 1 good thing about it, its breathable. The magnetic isn't strong so the band is always slipping around and coming loose on my wrist.<br />And it snags every piece of fabric it touchs."
2.0,It's ok. I wished it was smaller.
2.0,Twice these pants have torn in the crotch area. I've returned one pair and now the other pair did the same thing.
2.0,"These are cute and as pictured, but the stud/ latch part is significantly thicker than the gauge of most earring studs. I couldn’t figure out why they made my ears hurt until I compared them with other earrings. I gave up when my ear lobes started bleeding. May work for those with stretched or flexible piercings."
2.0,Returned this shoe it was more like a clog. Low back causes the shoe to flop when walking.
2.0,The bottom half was skin tight while the top was huge am I very proportionate in size
2.0,Wasn’t impressed with the material or the fit.
2.0,"Adorable shoes but, Glitter glitter EVERYWHERE. Like, all over my house. What a mess!!!! Sending back."
2.0,The pads inside the bra move everywhere. Very unhappy with this purchase.
2.0,They looks great but the black one broke about 2 weeks after wearing. I didn't expect these to last too long - they are pretty cheaply made. I've reinforced the brown one in places with superglue. Hopefully it'll last a little longer.
2.0,Broke the 3rd time he wore them. Not exactly impressed.
2.0,"The original wait time was long, and then it was extended by a couple of months more. Some of that was a shipping issue due to the pandemic. When an inquiry was made to Amazon, the company responded promptly. When the dress finally arrived, unfortunately it was not very flattering on. The return process really has me upset. It was listed as free returns (or I would not have ordered it), but shipping was going to be charged when I started the process. Again I contacted Amazon, they contacted the company, which then again contacted me. It was supposed to have been corrected, but in the end the shipping was still deducted. If I cannot depend on Amazon statement of free shipping it leaves me concerned about future orders."
2.0,When I revived this sweatshirt it was not as i was expecting. There was nothing to indicate that it would be cropped in the front. The fabric was poor quality.
2.0,Item was great looking but did not hold up well.
2.0,Loved  it  at first then it stopped working. So disappointed
2.0,"They might be 100% “Muslin” But I don’t think they are cotton. The texture isn’t like any of the other organic cotton cloths or bibs that I have purchased from other sellers. It is rough and feels like synthetic fiber; not as absorbent as I would expect from cotton either. This style of bib is great, I just wish it was trie soft cotton."
2.0,Not deep RED red like the picture which makes it look cheep. The arms are also weird it's not an off-shoulder has like separate openings to put your arms in like a freaking shirt... it's weird
2.0,Very cute but I'm concerned about the flimsiness of the toe strap. I think I have to figure out a way to make them more secure for the beach.
2.0,"The fit is fine.  I ordered a large: 5’4 155lbs and 36G.  I ordered the light pink and you can see everything.  I’ll be returning the pink, but will consider getting it in another color."
2.0,Quality control is crap
2.0,Band was on Gizmo for 2 weeks and already broke with normal wear. The material split and is coming off of the pin that attaches to Gizmo.
2.0,"I ordered an XL, this dress fit very tight. I wasn't satisfied w/ the way it fit my body"
2.0,I didn't like the material.  On the picture it looks very straight but the hat is very floppy.
2.0,"I was so disappointed with this purchase, I loved the look of it, but when it actually arrived not only was it a much darker shade than the picture but it was just an absolutely awful feeling sweater. Is very tight around the waste and chest areas, but has enormous sleeves, to the point of looking ridiculous. Put it on and took it right off again and put it in a bag to be donated."
2.0,"Heavy material not a t-shirt, looked small  therefor returned"
2.0,"I had ordered these and they were really tight. The waist wasn't an issue, but the leg parts of them felt really tight. Luckily there is a return policy and I didn't get stuck with them."
2.0,The material feels cheap and it runs smalll. Good print.
2.0,"Not a great product.  With easy handling, the mask filter portion broke, causing a hole after only 30 days of use.  Wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,The actual part that makes this whole thing work does not stick to the Velcro inside so moves all around the inside of the hat!! I need to find a glue or something to keep the Velcro on it. But I shouldn’t have to!
2.0,Looked very girlie and shiny... sad.
2.0,"On my first time using the band, one side of the band came apart. I had to use a super glue to reattach the band to the mechanism that holds my fitbit. If it wouldn't have fallen apart immediately I would give it 4 stars."
2.0,"Color is beautiful but sizing is WAY off. Ordered a medium which feels like a large! It fits more like a mens shirt, not very flattering. Needs to be tucked in to hide the true size but looks odd. Order a size down!!!!"
2.0,Ordered from here a few years ago-<br />quality has gone down<br />one of the earrings broke after two days.
2.0,I know they are midi but real small
2.0,"This top is wrong in a couple of ways.  The color appeared to be black or charcoal on a green field.  The stars are actually dark burgundy, and it's not a good combination in my opinion.  The other issue is the fabric.  It's that slippery, far from natural polystyrene stuff that some athletic clothing is made from.  I really don't like it.  It wasn't that expensive so I opted to keep it and wear it around the house.  If the dogs snag the material or it gets stained, I won't care.  My experience tells me it will live forever just because I don't like it.  Would not buy again."
2.0,"Bought it because it has no logo in picture, it does actually have a big logo across the top. Synthetic leather looks very cheap. Too big as well, have to make extra holes."
2.0,Not as expected. They are definetly not for loafers or flats. They come up more than halfway over the foot.
2.0,Returned this item. 6mm is not standard fit for a tragus. You will need to go up to 8mm or more.
2.0,As expected for the price. Wore this at a semi formal company event. I received lots of compliments but this fell apart after one wear. The rhinestones fell off of several parts and the rings broke loose and I had to fix them on my own with extra connecting rings I bought from Michaels.
2.0,Too big not as I expected
2.0,extremely small and style did not match the picture.  I was disappointed.  Luckily I have someone who I was able to gift it too.  She likes it so it all worked out well.
2.0,Boot fits just a little too loose. I know boots are supposed to have a slight slip but these slip a little more than should be. I’d say order half size down
2.0,Very small compared to pictures
2.0,Very pretty style but just too big all around.
2.0,"The waist band is high which I like, I thought the waist band would provide support, it does not. The leggings are much thinner than I expected. Yes you can see through them, even my no see undies you can see . :/  I don't hate them but I don't love them. Good for wearing if you have a long shirt or dress or skirt over top. Comfy enough to wear around the house. I would not wear them to the gym because they are see through."
2.0,"Very cute but the arm broke off very easily. My husband was able to reattach the first 12 times the screw came loose but, ultimately, we lost the one arm. Lenses also popped out very easily. Wouldn’t recommend for kids under 3."
2.0,Runs small fabric not that great but good for pool or lake dress for price. I kept it but have found better quality and fit elsewhere.
2.0,Very unflattering. I ordered my usual size and the dress hugged every problem area and was too short. I returned immediately.
2.0,I was trying to replace the same jacket my husband bought 10 years ago. It was very very similar but the fabric was different.  It felt like a cheaper  microfiber fabric rather than the soft and supple fleece from the old jacket.
2.0,"Hooks were sturdy but very short. Description states 6.8in but when it arrived, they were all short. Measured at 5.5in. Would be great for kids. Definitely not adult size."
2.0,The item was thin and not plush and short.
2.0,Too long for average height women
2.0,"Like another review said, they aren’t as pictured. Do have some unique Pokémon that I didn’t see elsewhere, but colors are wrong. Raichu has no eyes and jigglypuff looks so off I threw it away. Feels deceitful, they need to update the photo to what they actually look like."
2.0,"The quality is better than expected for the price BUT the sizing is off a bit. They don't provide any shaping support, so don't expect them to fit tight or compliment your but. They ran a but big for me even though I ordered my normal size. The most annoying part is that i paid $5.95 for shipping TO me and now I have to pay $3.95 for shipping the return. That's a rip off. Very unhappy."
2.0,"Looks nice, just has a strong odor.  I haven't started using it yet.  I am hoping that the odor will deminish after it lays on my counter a few days."
2.0,Bought this shirt for my boyfriend. It’s a basic long sleeve Henley pull-over t-shirt. I wanted to like it but it runs big……will be returning!
2.0,Ok but the wording is just a sticker that wasn't even completely pushed down. It'll tear up after a month of driving
2.0,"I bought a snowman dress and an elf dress.  Both were adorable and fit well.  The Santa sweater dress fits well except the waist area.  Very baggy.  If you have a large mid section it might work better.  Overall, not flattering."
2.0,"was not as shown in the picture. and the necklace itsself was much shorter then it said it was supposed to be. the bow was super tiny, and unporportionate to the rest of the pcs on the necklace. a little disapointed."
2.0,"Not a fan of these at all. They do their purpose, but they feel very cheap. They also are weird to look through. I don’t know how to describe it, but they don’t feel like other glasses or light-filtering glasses I’ve worn. Everything almost seems distorted. Would not recommend"
2.0,"Vest was sub-standard quality.<br />Size was way off, too small"
2.0,"All the good points mentioned above. I agree !<br />Downside: Heavily overpriced<br />Also, once I casually put the folded bills in the main compartment instead of the side compartment where they are supposed to be kept. The zipper got stuck. I can only open the wallet after a minor tear on the bills and lot of discomfort in doing so"
2.0,Two stars for the style and the colors of the dress and that is all I like about this dress I bought the dress twice the time I bought the dress it was a 1xl and that’s one size up from what I wear. I returned the dress and and rebought the same dress in a 2XL and the bust is still too small very disappointed.
2.0,It popped a screw one week in and than the hinge snapped of the week after
2.0,Lace portion seems super cheaply made. I returned
2.0,Not like the picture at all. Sleeves are not at all wide. They are tight fitting with a flare at the end. Dress not as flowy as picture a little more right fitting.
2.0,I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately it looks like it was made extremely quickly and not too well even the accessories were missing from the piece itself and it felt a little flimsy.
2.0,Not what i expected at all. It fits more like a throw than a sweater.
2.0,"Was really hoping to love this, but the length wasn’t there for me nor was it flattering for my body type. I’m 5’10 with a long torso and 34D cup and the way it fell on me was not as pictured/hoped."
2.0,Very much a balloon sleeve. Weird gathering at the shoulders. Material on the inside is not good.
2.0,Very small and looks kind of chintzy. Not something I would wear on the regular. Better suited for a young girl rather than a grown woman.
2.0,Too poofy for my body shape (apple) so I returned.
2.0,"For woman with long torso, not shorty like me.  Quality looked good."
2.0,"Sock don't last forever, that's a given, but I've never had any shell out this quickly. They didn't even make it six months before there were so many holes. The ones without holes look like they're ready to disintegrate."
2.0,Very cheap Quality!!! Guess u get what u pay for
2.0,Seams break
2.0,"The watch looks good. The problem is it keeps erratic  time. Yesterday, according to WWV, it was 20 seconds fast. Today, it was 15 seconds  slow.  It does not have a battery, so that is not the problem. Getting spport seems to take an act of Congress.  I would question buying this watch from anyone."
2.0,"Color is more orange-red than the picture.  Cheap thin fabric, sleeves are tight.  Will look for someone to give it to."
2.0,Order a size or two larger
2.0,"A little too big and the filters are wearing off fast, like the cotton fibers that they're made of are coming off."
2.0,Cute but very short in length
2.0,"Lens coating rubbed off on outside of lens with only normal pressure with soft slightly damp cloth (running shirt hem).<br />Otherwise, worked great. Trashing this pair since no return policy. Will probably try another brand, sadly."
2.0,"Cool idea. I really wanted it to work! They worked; for about 2 hours. :-/. Then they started to lift, slip and lose adhesion. I washed per instructions, one set and tried to use them again and they were almost immediately slipping."
2.0,"Cute no show socks, but they are super small.  Disappointed."
2.0,Not up to Polo standers.
2.0,Really cute shirt. Definitely small for the size. And the V-neck is cut pretty low
2.0,"Was not as described, should have listened to reviews.  Watch Band was NOT 11mm.  I have a hard time believing it was a women’s small as it was falling off my wrist.  Was not worth my time to return to $8.00.  They got there money.  Found a Jewelers today and had him put one on and told him he could just keep the band that was on my watch..didn’t fit, too big.  Sad!!!!"
2.0,So disappointed that they didn't fit my baby.
2.0,Runs small and had several places where stitching was bad.  Not great quality.
2.0,I tried this product 2 times. Second time when I tried to slide it over my wrist the strands broke and beads went all over my bed and everywhere! Very disappointed! I give it 2 stars because it was really cute and I liked it but is really cheap.
2.0,The purse is very nice but to small. I though it was larger in thr picture.
2.0,"Usually wear size M, this one just not well constructed, while the front is in the right place, the back is cut too low, very difficult to adjust the pad when biking."
2.0,Wasn't tight ? In the title it says tight so when I received the shirt I was very disappointed
2.0,"It's very adorable, however I ordered a 0-3 month and received a 12 month. Just have to wait awhile before we can wear it."
2.0,"Loose fit, falls out, hard plastic junk."
2.0,After 2 weeks of using them the stones started falling off. Not worth spending this kind of money on a product of such bad quality.
2.0,"I got this because I'm going out of town and I needed a replacement belly ring quick. Unfortunately, most of these are ugly (I suppose this is an opinion though) - however a lot of these aren't perfect matches like they're two close shades of blue and that's just unfortunate. Furthermore some are already stripped and won't tightly screw."
2.0,My gloves are coming apart already! I just purchased them for Christmas! I am a lot disappointed! I do feel that they should not unravel so quickly!
2.0,"This is the cheapest, tackiest material ever. The inside color of the fabric is white, making it look even cheaper. It’s polyester and looks nothing like the picture. Also the fit is bizarre. I’m 5’7 and 160 lbs and bought a large for length and because I have hips, but this was huge in the chest and tight around the hips and was just so awkward. Was very short on me too!"
2.0,What I tried it on it looked like I had 2 sets of boobs. I have curves and it was not flattering at all on me
2.0,this thing runs HUGE and the fabric was stiff. no thanks. returned!
2.0,"Overall this bag is okay, decently well made and pretty color. The straps are a little small tho for my liking I feel like the purse in shoved in my armpit. Lol."
2.0,"I bought for a trip, cheap material and small. I returned it."
2.0,"Way way too big, I'll be returning"
2.0,The sleeves are to short and shirt pulls on your neck. Not happy with the way it fits at all
2.0,Item is not what picture show. Picture show to have a belt type material around waste/under breast which it does not come with. I wear a size 14 in jeans and ordered a size 3x in this item which I thought of course would be big.. This item for my 13 year old which wears a size 5/6 in jeans. Was not happy with this item.
2.0,This item also says “snake eye” in the description but the balls are way to big 3-4mm ball is need for a snake eye piercing this is like a 4-5mm the balls are way to big and hard to talk... this is not what I expected and it’s disappointing.
2.0,It's a cute style but the fabric is so thin it's very see through & shows your entire bra through the top. I dislike wearing tanks under tops but unless you want your undergarments to show you will must.
2.0,"The chain is cheap as expected but is not unattractive and is functional. The teardrop I ordered was supposed to be rose quartz, but didn't look pink at all; it was a milky ivory color. I sent it back, because I was looking for a rose quartz long necklace."
2.0,"Soft to touch. Does not wear well, heels showed lint balls after a day at work. Faded after one wash."
2.0,"I dont like how these look. The fit/way the fabric was cut is not flattering if you have a bigger bottom. It barely fits my bottom, it kind of bunches up/balloons towards the lower waist and then its tight in the hips and thighs. I was hoping for flowy shorts and I have to say I'm very disappointed.<br />4' 11"" 128lbs 29"" waist 40"" hips got a Medium."
2.0,Very cute shoe but I wanted it for a big girl size 4 to 6 is what I ordered. It was not the product that I wanted I wanted it for a big kid and I got it toddler size
2.0,Smaller than I would have liked
2.0,Sizes run SMALL
2.0,"I have had other polarized glasses and these do not seem as if they are. they do come in a case for carrying or storing, but hard to get them in/out of it. The clip on part is so large it touches your face and the entire thing is flat, like not one tiny bit of curve to it, so they don't cover your glasses well, you can see out between them and your lenses. I fear this being so flat that they touch my lenses and quit wearing them because I worried over time they would scratch."
2.0,"I recently purchased and then canceled my order for this item due to the differences in the description between the pictures of the product and the text descriptions on the page. The picture of the item very clearly states that it is PU leather, However the written description on the page says it is genuine cowhide Italian leather. At this price I doubt that that is the case. I hope Amazon or the manufacturer will correct this discrepancy for future orders."
2.0,"Gave it away it didnt look right on me, in the picture  it looks way better."
2.0,These pants are completely shear and they are way too small. I usually where a US women's 10 and got an XL for comfort. The waistband was incredibly tight and uncomfortable. Not a bargain at all.
2.0,"Half of them came broken, and three of the non broken ones, two have broken while I’m wearing them"
2.0,Was advertised as easy on and easy off by manufacturer. This is not the case.<br /><br />Easier going on then getting off. Slightly better than the standard compression socks<br />Does do the job once on
2.0,The shape is not very smooth and the clip onto the glasses is hard to put on and will not stay even on both sides. Returned.
2.0,Breaks easily some of the pieces were broken upon arrival
2.0,i am returning! the wave is a lot thicker in person than in the picture. the rose gold is more of a copper and it tarnished
2.0,After wearing this headband once the Nike symbol fell off and was outside my window to return it. Very disappointed
2.0,"Bracelet is nice, perfect size but broke shortly after wearing it."
2.0,"Received this as a Father's Day gift last year after we sold David to some miners in Burkina Faso, but after many, many attempts to pair it with my iPhone---NADA!<br />No instructions WHATSOEVER on how to charge it (and WHERE---have fun finding the USB-C port.)<br />Laughable.<br />On top of that, even when the watch is apparently charged, the Step Counter DOESN'T EVEN WORK! I tell you for sure that I KNOW I walked more than 23 steps today AT LEAST!<br /><br />So your left with 1. Spotty bluetooth, 2. No USB port (and, oh yeah, don't even bother getting the recommended wireless charger) 3. Doesn't even accurately count steps--BASIC tech for 2021.<br /><br />Seller was really great though: let me return it even after I smashed it on the ground out of frustration, and they even helped in getting me the travel visa so I could go and bring David back home. (He shouldn't have tried stealing from the mining company though, that's one wrist he'll never wear a watch on---slides right off LOL!!!. At least he's still has his right hand)<br />Silver lining:  he won't ever have to wear this disappointing timepiece..."
2.0,Flimsy materials and very tight around toe area
2.0,"I purchased a size large for my teen and when they arrived they were so small my younger child said she could wear them. Sure enough, they did not fit a expected and I passed them to my 10 year old child."
2.0,Not Square as the description says. More of a pilots frame.
2.0,Had funny smell. Just ok.
2.0,The material was super aggressive onto my skin. What the heck maker?!  Ya think your customers enjoy rough material on skin?!  How about more comfortable gentle material before you sell more discomfort. Not only that but also more adjustable notches so it can be worn on the upper forearm.
2.0,"These are pretty rings, shiny metal and nice stones. But they do not fit to size, I usually wear a size 8 and I couldn’t get these past my knuckles. I wish they made larger sizes."
2.0,"Just... odd construction, itchy, lined with something that doesn't seem like silk- avoid."
2.0,Very small cute I ended up giving this to my granddaughter very small
2.0,The band fell off before my daughter could ever wear it.
2.0,Ordered them and they’re WAY too small. I got a M and wish I got a L or XL
2.0,"The Pros: a great look and they're properly dark and great for sunny outdoor activities.<br /><br />The cons: the nice dark lenses tend to pop out randomly and if you inadvertently drop them on any surface short of a mattress, then the frames will break.<br /><br />Honestly I'd give these more stars if the frames were made out of play-doh. The plastic is that terrible."
2.0,"I'm returning them.  I've had several pair and I found these were small for a 7 1/2 and the quality of the seams were not what I've had in the past.  Previous gloves had all edges inside the seams, these had edges on the outside, top stitched. Disappointing."
2.0,Very soft too fuzzy though
2.0,"Ok,, supposedly the little hooks are to hold on to the mask,,,,, right ....  if so,,  it not doing it, regardless of  3 different mask that I try it on,, so NO not happy to give them  a good report’"
2.0,Case came apart after two weeks of use
2.0,"If you’re round like me, or if you have big boobs this is a No no!"
2.0,"bad curve, looks more like a horseshoe"
2.0,"For sure if it is a Mans shirt order a size bigger, it is a slimmer cut tee shirt."
2.0,"After reading reviews that this runs small, I ordered a 3XL, I'd say it fits more like a large. I'm usually an 18-20 and the 3X is like a 14."
2.0,"Cute but the backs are so loose and the studs so short, they fall off"
2.0,Didn't expect much based on the cost but one of the chains broke within days of being worn.
2.0,"I was sooo disappointed when I received these pajamas. I ordered a 3T and it was so small it was more like a size for an 18M.  The tag says &#34;should be worn snuggly for safety&#34; snuggly is one thing, strangulation is another.  Other than that, nice fabric and quality."
2.0,"Sleeve holes are huge, extremely long, but not too baggy."
2.0,"This bag could have been better with better straps for Shoulder support, also why was the bag two sidess very bended, it support to be straight with shape .<br />Also saw a small white powder like marking on my bag , Why?<br />Noticed a loose Blue Thread on my bag<br />Not Happy , had this bag less than a week."
2.0,"This picture does NOT show what this tutu actually looks like.  The photo makes it look like the tutu is thick.  When I received the tutu, it was completely transparent.  It is nice if you don't mind it being see-through, but it doesn't look like the photo at all."
2.0,I was very disappointed in these. They are small and squished. I will have to really embellish to make them look ok.
2.0,The gift came with only one ball on it.  And the blue hoops paint is already peeling off and caused my ear to get infected even though I cleaned the piercing before putting it in and also numerous time over the next 2 days till I had to take it out.  All the other colors did great. Blue was the only bad apple.
2.0,"The material is super thin, the pants pretty much feel like you’re wearing a tablecloth. I wish I would’ve ordered a large, I’m 5’7” and 135 lbs."
2.0,I so wanted this to work. It was nice and thick and soft. Good quality piece of clothing for the price. It just did not look flattering on my figure unfortunately. Had to return.
2.0,It's comfortable light weight but extremely short; I was planning on wearing it as a dress but seeing it's so short looks like it will be another nightie
2.0,CHEAP PRODUCT
2.0,"I measured the dress and the bust and waist was pretty accurate. The length was a few inches long and I don't even know what the sleeve measurement measures... The fabric is supposedly 95% cotton, but it feels like 100% heavy polyester and really scratchy! And if you have a large waist, the solid black waistband really accentuates it. A bad style choice on my part."
2.0,"I have four main issues with this product:<br /><br />1. The description for this product said it would fit medium sized glasses. My glasses are not big (see photos) but I could see them being squished by this case when I closed it. Unless you have very small, flat glasses, this case may not work for you.<br /><br />2. The side that holds your contacts has an indention for the contact lens case, but the indention is too small to hold a standard contact lens case. I know A LOT of people who use the Optifree PureMoist solution, which comes with the white and teal case, so I think it’s strange that this company made a product that wouldn’t hold a case that size. I tried a smaller blue case that I got from my contact lens supplier, and even that one didn’t fit. This means that I HAVE to use the one it comes with, but it only comes with one. You’re supposed to change your contact lens case at least once every 3 months to prevent bacteria build-up. So I either have to use that contact lens case for more than 3 months and risk an eye infection, or I have to buy a pack of cases that are small enough to fit here.<br /><br />3. The product itself was defective or badly made. The top part of one side of the case doesn’t line up with the bottom part, so there is a gap left open when the case is closed. (see photo)<br /><br />4. The red color is actually more of a maroon color in real life. I was already on the fence about buying the red because I was hoping it would be brighter in person, but it was actually much darker.<br /><br />I ended up returning this product."
2.0,This shirt runs small.....
2.0,"It's cute, but not as described. Band is same width on both sides, doesn't narrow at top of head. Disappointed."
2.0,"These shoes are very cute, but aren't long lasting. Got them for Christmas for our boy; one month after each shoe had a hole on a toes area which grew larger and larger. He did alter them with other sneakers, but still, by now they aren't good to go out. I'd say they last 3 months at most."
2.0,"Overall, I like the look of it. The functionality, however, is a real issue. It's difficult to ope and not well made"
2.0,"Indeed, it is long enough. The appearance is sufficient, but not beautiful. Worth the money. However, I'd pay 3-4 times as much were the tie of good quality. There is no backing so there is no ability to make a good knot. The point of buying an extra long tie is to make up for the size a very Big/Tall man. Instead, even a double Windsor knot looks like a four in hand high school knot."
2.0,"Love the color & fit until the sole cracked & every time I step there is a pop & it's very uncomfortable. Return window closed yesterday of course. If seller will send me a replacement, I will change my review."
2.0,"What could be a nice top is ruined by the thick, awkward fabric and the lack of lining. The color looks very weird laid down, since the stitching from the inside is visible. It's neatly done, but very clearly not meant to be on the outside. Therefore, this looks best with the collar rolled up as shown in picture. Unfortunately that's not acceptable in a jacket/wrap of this type."
2.0,Too small would size up 2 sizes in irder for it to fit me best.  Since I do not like tight shirts.
2.0,"Cheap quality, but good for one or two wears."
2.0,"The colors are not as bright as the picture shows. Also, it looks like it can fade easily after a few washes. If this was in the $10 dollar range, I would accepted no questions. But for $30, I expect a little bit of more quality."
2.0,Not child size.
2.0,Cheaply made about 2 sizes too small. What looks like embroidery is iron on plastic
2.0,"When I first put it on, it fit great! I liked it. But it took a turn for the worst. I wore it for a few hours, it started to rise and also felt really tight. Once I took it off I had marks and cuts all over my stomach and by my bra strap area and I also broke out. The fit was great when I first put it on put 2-3 hours in it just felt extremely tight and uncomfortable. This happened the first time I wore it and I have not put it back on yet."
2.0,thin see through
2.0,"Threading is coming undone, and just wore a few times! Plus they both seem small, but it was told that they are appx. 8 inches long. Now I know what size fits me."
2.0,Took over a month to get here. Not a sweatshirt at all. Just a thin shirt. Ran small
2.0,"Returned them, too big for my face & the color was not flattering."
2.0,This face mask would be great if the filters were shaped to fit the mask they put a lot of pressure on the nose and make it uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,They hurt my ears! I splurged on some RayBans and they don't bother me at all.
2.0,Ordered a size larger and it was still too small.
2.0,"Did not realize this had crotch snaps,  instead of the lined area most leos I've purchased have. My daughter does not like to wear it,  since she needs to wear an extra layer underneath to protect her from the snaps. Not the best design decision for a garment made for movement!"
2.0,Didn't like the fit the bottoms were very wide
2.0,The pants are good quality and cute but I ordered an Xl and got a 3xl so I can’t even wear them. Really disappointed
2.0,Does not fit my frames
2.0,"The gown opening on top is not that big. I’m a 4X and that’s what I ordered, after washing on cold and lite dry the gown Totally Shrunk!  It was expensive too, so now I’m out of $$ and still need a cotton night gown!"
2.0,"My husband bought these for me for Christmas and I loved them; however, the stitching attaching the flip part to the glove started to unravel after about two weeks. The flip part of one of my gloves is literally hanging by a thread currently."
2.0,"the material used for this product is too delicate that when i wore my floating vest on top of it, the fabric frayed where the vest rubs with the textile material. Now it looks really funny.  And that was just 2 hours of boat fishing. It looks great but you have to take care of it not to wear anything on top of it (e.g.: fishing vest,floating vest ) which sadly defeats the porpose of it being a fishing shirt."
2.0,tighter than expected and I have a ring sizer. I think they run small
2.0,Nice long dress but the threading is showing on the outside at the front of the dress. Nice material and length but it came with that flaw
2.0,"Very disappointing product. One of the barbells fell off while I was wearing the studs, and now it is not safe to wear them anymore as they might fall off. I am pretty sure that I tightened the barbells properly, but they just become loose to easily."
2.0,Not stableman head. Slips off easily
2.0,These pants are made from a really weird material. It feels thin and papery. Cheap.
2.0,"This case was bought for its 4 wheels and light weight. It arrived and looked as if it would fit the bill perfectly. TAfter the case was packed for our holidays we discovered a problem, when full the case has a tendancy to want to fall forward and did on many occasions. I think Samsonite should have known about this, if they dont they will now. It needs to be improved and given the choice again we would buy something else."
2.0,"I was disappointed when these arrived... the purple pair were bent and felt very flimsy.  They felt very different from the pink pair that felt solid, yet lightweight.  Wish I would have only purchased one pair, or skipped these all together."
2.0,Picture of Elvis was small.Was only on the bottom left side of shirt.Thought the picture would be the whole front of shirt.
2.0,The photo I. The description makes it seem as though they have a metallic sheen to them. Not at all! Just plain silicone.
2.0,Extremely short.
2.0,"The shirt has some unusual extras, strange shoulder patches and mid sleeve buttons.  I wouldn’t buy it again."
2.0,The red shirt looks a little girly to me and also the tag was sewn on the outside of the shirt when it should have been on the inside.  I sent these back they were not worth it for me.
2.0,"Love the cut, but the top fits really weird."
2.0,the satin pleats weren't what i expected
2.0,"The colors are not as vivid as pictured, they are more muted and the yellow is really more of a goldenrod color not bright and popping like it looks here. The fit is not fitted at all, just like a big sack dress. Doesn't go all the way to floor."
2.0,I was looking for something to wear as an under shirt and compress my belly a little. Well a little is All it did. So I am disappointed in the product
2.0,"What a weird bra. I'm a 34G, which usually means I wear a large in sports bras, but I saw this fit small, so I ordered an XL. Its the weirdest fit I've ever seen, there is almost no fabric around the cups, but the band must be able to fit someone with a rib cage size of 42. The fabric isn't athletic wear, its more like swimsuit material. Its going right back."
2.0,"Overall was pretty disappointed in the garment. The material was very thin and lightweight, to the point that durability was a significant concern for me. Additionally the fit proportions were very odd. While having a bit of extra room is helpful in a pant like this (tactical skinny jeans aren't a thing yet, I hope), the way that the pant seemed to flare from the hip down to create VERY large legs created a very odd look / fit on me, even when wearing boots."
2.0,"Very cute, nice fabric, but absolutely huge. It says &#34;one size&#34; and the tag says Medium but I don't know in what world this is a medium. It fits me like an XL. Since I can't get it in a smaller size and it's comfortable, I'll keep it, but I would've liked to have worn it outside instead of as a relaxation shirt."
2.0,"This band is NOT for the Monaco! I contacted the seller about this quite some time ago and randomly checked back to see if they corrected the description. They have not. Don’t get me wrong, this is a high quality watch replacement strap! Just not for the Monaco which is flat without a curve! My pick show an original (and super icky) Monaco rubber strap alongside this item after I filed them down in attempt to make them work. I figure it’s worth a shot because this is a really nice strap."
2.0,One of the seals on the hologram is not totally connected.
2.0,These were very tiny and thin.  I've lost on already.
2.0,Way too dark of a lens
2.0,They don't stay tied and now after a couple of weeks they are wearing in 2. I would not purchase this product again
2.0,This was you can see-through all most you can see your body like you ware nothig
2.0,"The watch is easily read, but it arrived with half the wristband cut off.. I can barely get it on. Very disappointed"
2.0,"Cheap material. After about one week of wearing the flip flops, the foam around the heel area got ripped out."
2.0,"Love this, but unfortunately, the gold color wears off and then turns my skin green and infected my belly button.."
2.0,This product is similar to the body jewelry found at a beauty supply store. I was expecting it to be bigger and of better quality.
2.0,"These gloves do stretch, but they are truly designed for toddler hands. I bought them for my 6 year old and they are borderline too small and slightly uncomfortable."
2.0,Been wearing compression socks for years.  The two biggest problems found are socks that won't stay up and thin enough to accommodate my feet swelling at the end of the day.  These socks failed both of these priorities.  First off they are just a bit to short to fully fit over my calf (I'm 6 foot tall and purchased size large).  These socks are much thicker then any other compression socks I've purchased in the past and after a few hours I could feel my toes swell.  Your experience may differ from my but these things are not cheap and wanted to provide my feedback.<br /><br />On the plus side they are well made and could be nice and cushy if you can wear a thick sock.  Product shipped on time.<br /><br />They claim to provide a refund if not 100% satisfied but I have not found a way to return them yet.  I have contacted the reseller and will post their response.
2.0,I didn't like the color and returned it.
2.0,These dresses were cute but shank considerably in the wash.
2.0,Fits great but way shorter than image portrays
2.0,I gave 2 stars because only 1 of the three pairs of shorts was the right size. All three were totally different sizes claiming to be all one size.
2.0,I don't know how to fasten it without it hanging down. I'm afraid it's gonna break every time it drops below my ankle.
2.0,Wasn't what I thought but like the color
2.0,I feel like it keeps going in your mouth smothering you! I would not recommend it!
2.0,Shirt material feels good but the XL is not an XL. More like a Large. Returning it.
2.0,"Nice comfortable material, but the skirt is made really awkward with the hemming. The skirt does not flatter your body."
2.0,I think this hat was made for children.
2.0,"Like ALMOST everything about these shoes (fits great, stays put most of the time and looks adorable) but since the material is cotton, it is hard to wash them.  I bought them for my daughter to use indoor on our laminate and tile floors and still cannot get them white anymore even though I wipe them clean at the end of the day.  I would recommend the dark shoes even though they are more for boys than for girls."
2.0,arrived damaged. had to return them.
2.0,This looks so cute in the pictures but it’s paper thin. It doesn’t even have the texture of a normal scarf so the person I gifted it to didn’t even realize it was a scarf at first. I was embarrassed and disappointed. But something else
2.0,The dress didn't come in when it was supposed to.  When i tried it the the zipper broke and it was to long.
2.0,The decorative pieces were so big and did not seem proportionate at all
2.0,Bought this thinking it would look super cute and the sizing was correct. I was wrong lol don’t get me wrong it’s super cute I love it! But it just shows way much more than I excepted. The top isn’t too bad on measurements but a lot of the cleavage spills out. As for the bottoms they show a lot more than what the picture shows. The skirt is kind of the only thing that is accurate. Super cute just wished it fit better.
2.0,"These are cute and idea is great; however, the lights only last about 2 weeks.  We have had 3 pairs between my 2 boys, and they have all been the same."
2.0,The top portion is perfect! The problem is that the blouse is to short so you have to wear a tank top under it and if you are big chest wise it will probably fit super short.
2.0,This is adorable.<br />But a button is missing and the other buttons are falling off. If it weren’t for the hassle of trying to get another one for the same price I’d just do that. But instead I have to sew the buttons on myself the CORRECT way.  Ridiculous.
2.0,"These charms are really cute, but I couldn't use half of them because they were broken off of the part that is supposed to go in your Crocs. I really wish they would have been useable because they are so cute"
2.0,"These were very nice but they send me the same mask, no Father of the groom...."
2.0,I think it must be a child's XL.  I gave it to a friend who wears children's sizes.
2.0,"I did not like these pants. I was looking for office pants and these were not a great material for me. I have a small waist, small hips but large thighs. I had to hike these pants up and that caused there to be some awkwardness in my crotch area. The material was similar to a Halloween costume. These pants may work for you but they did not work for my athletic body shape."
2.0,Material wrinkles alot..disappointing
2.0,"If you want this shirt and need it fast, pay for shipping.  I ordered this shirt on Nov.26th.and got it Dec 22.  I totally forgot I even ordered it.  I was excited once I got it, but dicapointed once I finally put it on.  There is a small hole on the side (pics).  It seems true to size as this is a med. I would have given 3 stars if the hole wasn't there.  Other than that, it's a fine enough shirt<br /> Just wish there was no hole..."
2.0,Viene súper reducido como para una niña.
2.0,photo not representative of the actual product
2.0,They felt too tight and hard to slip on and off.
2.0,It was not easy to put on your wrist
2.0,"I decided to try this brand out and I must have received a bad batch, the lenses do not fit well at all and is very apparent when laid on top of the original Oakley lenses. Instructions and lens holding case is nice though."
2.0,Did not work as expected
2.0,"Colors are vibrant! But the material is a thick spandex, makes it look<br />cheap Runs big!"
2.0,"I don't really care for it. I was hoping I would like it and I do like the size.  It was cheap and it looks it (the handles feel the cheapest) so honestly it is probably worth what I paid for it.  I was just hoping for a bargain and this isn't.  Also, I don't think it will last long."
2.0,Looks like a kids ring you get out of a gumball machine. Way to expensive for the quality.
2.0,This product is extremely thin and see through. Looks much cheaper in person.
2.0,"Its a nice looking top, but larger than expected. Also seems cheaply made, no tags attached, somewhat see through and the seams are far from perfect. I ended up giving it away otherwise I would have returned it."
2.0,"I was excited for this set, and I am also surprised it has such good reviews.<br />This is a very poorly and cheaply made product.  The pants are very baggy, the elastic at the waist became completely distorted after one wear, and there is no label to show front from back (and difficult to tell without)<br /><br />I was hoping to buy several of these, but now regret buying one."
2.0,Unflattering for me. The positioning of the top wasn’t right and neither was the bottom. Stretched at weird areas and was loose in other areas. Returned.
2.0,"Disappointed to receive this piece and see it is already worn looking. Along the bra line cup is already torn with the underwire exposed and the underwire liner is already pilled from someone else wearing it! This product was listed as NEW and it clearly is NOT!!! This item is so hard to find, I'm going to just repair it myself..... but be VERY cautious if you decide to buy from here. You probably won't be getting a new product :-( kind of disappointing."
2.0,Ear flaps don't hug my ears to keep them warm.
2.0,"The fabric is ok and the overall quality is not bad, however, there are 2 issues for me:<br />1. the size is more for a slim fir than regular fit. So i got XL instead of my usual L and the fit is good but the length is a little too much. So if you are looking for a slim fit this should not be an issue for you.<br />2. The biggest problem for me is the neck! i ordered V-Neck and got more of a Water Drop-Neck, which is more of a round neck than a V one. And for someone who don't like round neck, i suffer from the same throat uncomforting due to the pressure point near the throat."
2.0,Its a cute ring but broke in 2 pieces just after wearing it one time.
2.0,"Material is weird, but we would have used it still had it fit. My petite ten year old couldn't squeeze into the XL."
2.0,"This jewelry was ment for bridesmaids so I needed them to be very pretty, the earrings are pretty and the bracelet is ok but the necklace is ugly, the picture looks so good then you try it on and the necklace isn't flowy its very narrow like its ment for a childs neck. I returned them and found cute jewelry and Icing and she gave me discount for being a bride."
2.0,La cadena es muy finita y cortica..No es lo gue reprecenta en la foto
2.0,Very boxy and not flattering.
2.0,"I ordered my usual medium and it was gigantic!  It seems like it would be very warm.  The fabric was nice and soft, but I was hesitant to buy another size as I'm unsure if even the smallest size would fit."
2.0,Every time my son steps the light change color and the charging port keeps poking his feet
2.0,"They are cute.  Fits my 7th grades much better than me, a petite adult."
2.0,Sits low on the nose. Granny glasses
2.0,"This shirt was super cute and fit well (I ordered a small)! I wore it to work and was complimented by some coworkers. However, it ripped at the seam after only one wash. Very unfortunate as I really liked the shirt. Wish it would have been made with better material."
2.0,"Cute earrings, but they rust very quickly"
2.0,This is see through. Not what I thought.  I will return it.
2.0,Picture and fabric looks better.
2.0,"The size chart for this dress is really confusing. the one I received fits well in the shoulders but is somehow too big everywhere else? also, the product was mildly damaged. :( I loved it in theory but, unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it."
2.0,Looked beautiful but had to return only received one
2.0,Didn't fit rt.
2.0,Really wanted these but tried to cancel order when the shipping was outrageous on a little pair of earings
2.0,"Color wasn’t green like the picture, the fur kept falling off, stitches on the hands were already loose when received and can’t even see the eyes....."
2.0,"It could have just been me, but these glasses weren’t comfortable and didn’t have nice clear vision that I got with the next set of bifocal safety glasses I purchased."
2.0,Bought this for my husband and it is very small
2.0,"Don't get me wrong, they are beautiful... but they snag on everything, including my hair and some of the rhinestones are too small for the settings."
2.0,"Too small for Americans heads. I have a very medium sized hat size, but they really skimped on this one.  Had to smash it on my head and once it was on, the brim is way too small.  As a world traveler, including visits and tours to China, It is clear that Asians are smaller boned people than the western world.  That said, if they are going to make hats and clothing for western world, why would you not adjust the sizes to FIT your customers.  It's called, playing to your audience.  I have passed on MANY products that I've seen and really liked from Asian companies, because I've had to return too many due to the fact that they simply didn't fit and returning them is a huge hassle!  Never again!"
2.0,This dress is not for me. I didn’t like the shoulders part.
2.0,Sooooo adorable and so soft. What a bummer the golden yellow colored fabric was see through on the backside.<br />The shoulders should also be broader. I do not have wide shoulders and the sleeves did not lay in the ideal spot.<br />Would have still kept it if the material were somehow less see through.
2.0,"The soles are very cushy and comfortable, as I expected from Hoka.<br />The vertical part between my toes, however, is extremely rough and felt painful from the instant I put them on.<br />I've had many different types of flip-flops and never have any been as scratchy as these.<br />Expecting blisters between my toes, I returned them."
2.0,The sleeves are way to puffy!!!!
2.0,We ordered the blue shark ones and they are not cotton. Stiff and polyester feeling material.  We have the green dinosaur ones and LOVE them!  These are definitely different.  I’m returning them.
2.0,I wish the colors would have some brightness to them. I like the slim band.
2.0,Came sealed in a cheap plastic bag.  I would be embarrassed to give it as a gift.  I strongly suspect not a Coach product.
2.0,The waster shaper portion is fine... the underwear is VERY small and uncomfortable.
2.0,This would have been a great summer dress but the material felt cheap & the seams at the waist were uneven. The dress also did not come with the belt shown in photos. I ended up returning instead of finding another sash because of the poor construction & cheap material.
2.0,"i didnt like it.. it was really uncomfortable. i got rid of it in a few days.<br /><br />dont buy it if ur a large head dude.. good for kids, not good for the big guys"
2.0,"I love the look, fit, and feel of this jacket, but it came with the zipper broken so had to return.  After reading more reviews with zipper being broken or breaking easily, I am hesitant to reorder. This jacket does run small, as do all the Running Gear athletic wear, so order up if you do order."
2.0,"This dress is very cute. The quality is actually pretty decent. However, there's a huge slit up either side which will make it impossible to wear without leggings underneath."
2.0,Ok the image is good the fit is more athletic borderline regular fit. Depends on your gut or lack of. The sleeve sucks - it flares out like I got wings by my delts. That’s the only thing I hate about it the sleeve flares.
2.0,"Great fabric, looks good -- but Way too small for the size chart posted. Order AT LEAST 2 sizes above what you typically wear."
2.0,"My son loves it, but the little piece of metal that holds the tooth broke within a week of my son wearing it. Now I’m going to have to try and drill a small hole in it so i can run a chain through, so he won’t lose the tooth at recess due to poor quality materials."
2.0,This dress is cheaply made and extremely thin. In the dress does not appear as pictured
2.0,The bracelet broke into pieces. I didn’t understand why. One piece after another just popped off.
2.0,It’s not what I ordered supposed to be embroidered on the front side and back it’s only don’t on the front of the hat even the sticker says front back and sides  it’s a ok hat just disappointed I didn’t get what I ordered it was for my son so I decided to keep it as a proud US Army Veteren I love showing my pride for service wish it said what I ordered
2.0,"Wore it once, washed it and it was covered with pulling.  Very cheap fabric, there it in the trash with the other one I bought."
2.0,"An XL is definitely meant for someone with a long torso and long legs not for someone that needs a little extra room around the middle. The fabric is a really thin. The elastic in the waistband feels odd, like it stretches out but won't go back to its original shape. Since there is so much &#34;extra&#34; fabric between the crouch and the top of the waistband, I have to roll it down, making it uncomfortable."
2.0,"Well..let's start by saying if you are going to sell something you should make sure your picture is of the product you are selling. I get that when you order a Big Mac you are not getting the perfect hamburger on TV but at least it is somewhat represented when you receive it. These boxers have an elastic band that says Hanes and isn't the cheesy boxers we received that my husband hates and is not upset with me because I ordered the wrong underwear for him (which clearly by the picture and description I didnt) So as I sleep on the couch tonight I will be processing a return on these items. Hopefully today when we go to a local store (Not Wal-Mart because well I haven't shopped there in years) they will have the underwear my husband wants, which will probably not be the case as this is why we chose Amazon. Please which me luck on my underwear adventures today on my husband's birthday. Hopefully we find the underwear he prefers."
2.0,The sleeves were more for an orangutan. The shirt body was too short.
2.0,"Even though this had a number of reviews indicating the gloves are fairly warm in cold weather activities, they did not keep my hand warm biking in weather below freezing.  However, my hands get cold easily, so others might have better luck. I actually wasn't expecting much for the price and would not have purchased these absent the free return policy.  Were also very slightly small."
2.0,Two of my lights already went off and I’ve worn it three times.
2.0,The material was not what I was expecting.  It feels hot.  Not comfortable
2.0,Broke quickly. Took a long time to arrive. It has kept it shine.
2.0,"These shoes look just as described and depicted, PU leather seem to be of good quality.  Unfortunately, just right shoe worked as expected.  Left shoe got stuck on blue light until the battery died, it didn't hold charge after that.  I returned the first pair, bought a replacement pair, same exact problem, left shoe failed. What a shame, I really liked these shoes.  The funny part is that both pairs I got arrived with 2 USB cables and 2 remotes."
2.0,"The dress was fine I liked the cut but, I didn't like the fabric at all so I returned it"
2.0,Sooooo cheap. Had to return. I would recommend this for a very thin person who loves yellow. I love yellow but I get deez curves. This definitely didn’t work for me.
2.0,"Pros: looks good and comes with a tool to remove extra links.<br /><br />Cons: broke on the drive to work the first time wearing it. Luckily, the part of the link that broke off fell in the car, but I wasn't happy about having to super glue it back together before getting to even wear it for the day. Also, the link remover tool bent and made removing the link pins very tricky."
2.0,"These sunglasses look awesome, so I purchased for myself and as a gift (both the walnut wood wayfarer style).<br />They're super comfortable, the lenses are great, and (again) they look awesome.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the durability really bummed me out. I really tried to treat my SoFlows with kitten mittens because I loved the look so much. Even put them in a hardshell case. But somehow I found mine bent in the corners and unwearable in less than a month of wear & tear.<br /><br />This is a product I'd really love to recommend. And I had been weekly when receiving compliments. But with less than a month lifespan in my experience (missed my return/exchange window), I can't motivate myself to buy another pair."
2.0,"Nice top, but way too small! I ordered a large and I usually wear medium or large!"
2.0,"The colors are decent, the size is why oversized and flowy."
2.0,It lasted long enough to get thru my 5 year old’s birthday party. The waist band is worthless.
2.0,Bought a pair for both of my boys. Ordered a size bigger then their normal shoe size and still are too small their toe it poking out the front.
2.0,"Far too narrow for my feet -- probably fit a woman OK, but not a Man"
2.0,They were made in a heavy material. Very uncomtable
2.0,The plastic clasp in the back broke on the first use with one of the pairs.
2.0,"The sweater was super cute but the red color rubbed off on EVERYTHING - my skin, jeans, undershirt, purse, child, etc. It was so bad and hard to wash off."
2.0,"This is very, very comfortable, just WAY TOO BIG AND TOO LONG. I even tried a smaller size, but it fit the same. Fabric and colors are great, though. I am usually a L or XL, but even a medium is too big."
2.0,Size up!  I typically wear between large or xl.  38DD. Ordered an xl and was short and tight.
2.0,This dress is basically 98% see through. I can’t wear it in public.
2.0,I found the watch to be incredibly thick. It was about twice the thickness of my cell phone and was awkward on my wrist. I returned it. Perhaps a younger person would not find this a problem.
2.0,"I love the idea of this ring. I bought one for myself and my teenage daughter and we both loved them. We started wearing them two weeks ago and my daughter's finger has already started to turn green under the ring band. My ring has the fake silver coming off already, on the contact and non-contact sides both so that a dull rosy color is showing through. So disappointed."
2.0,"It’s a great band, but false advertisement. All photos show the band with a buckle and they don’t have buckles...they have snap in bands. They should show exactly what you are buying."
2.0,"I'm truly an XL (5'6&#34; and 200 lbs, size 16).  That being said, in the hips and stomach, this blouse is just plain tight and short.  If I pulled it down to it's longest length, it would barely cover the bottom of my hoo-hah and it is body hugging from just below my breasts to the hem.  There is no &#34;blousy-ness&#34; to it for this size.  Frankly, being an XL, my baby pooch is the least attractive part of my body and it is admittedly the &#34;fattiest&#34; part of my body, but this style top really hugs the lumps and bumps and is just not pretty.  The shoulder area fits nice and loose (I'm also broad shouldered from years of swimming butterfly and playing in the front row of a rugby scrum) but the bottom truly hugs the pooch.  So, if you happen to be a tall, big woman with a flat tummy, this will be PERFECT!  Otherwise, I'd be cautious about purchasing this.  Also, as other reviewers have stated, the banded part is not elastic-y at all.  It will not stretch.<br /><br />So, the top is pretty and would be great for a thinner person, but if you are truly an XL, I doubt you will be pleased with it.  I believe the manufacturer labeled it an XL out of a sense of obligation but did not increase the size (width) due to material costs."
2.0,"They might be good for people that were glasses but the way they fit without prescription glasses its awkward and they dont highlight colors, and dont help out with the glare, honestly i dont know what can i use them for. Oh and i almost forgot they were scratch, as soon as i opened them i saw it"
2.0,They are not what I Expected. Tgey are very thin. Can be wore with dress but cant be wore alone.
2.0,The waist & chest are NOT American proportioned to one another unless you have no problem slipping into your skinny jeans. The sizes are definitely Chinese : an extra large was tight where I normally fit a large just right. Which is a shame because the styling for the very low price is a bargain.
2.0,poorly made. total made in china crap!
2.0,Pretty but won’t last long
2.0,I loved this shirt until I washed it the second time. Now the letters are all crinkly and falling off. 😭😭😭😭😭
2.0,"I ordered this for a possible costume idea but the overall look, the smell and just feel made me opt to just make a mummy prop for my yard.  It was ok but required lots of modifying to make it look better!<br /><br />Overall as a mask you definitely get what you pay for.  Not really going to recommend unless you want a cheap mask."
2.0,"I have a cheaper Hobart cloth apron that I have used for over 10 years. It's a good apron but it does not stand up to welding which I do occasionally. I decided to spend a little more money and get a better, more durable apron that would withstand welding splatter, grinder dust and the wires that get slung off from a wire wheel. This apron  does all that and does it well. The leather is thick. It will most likely be around a life time if I take care of it. My complaint is, and it is a small one, this thing is heavy, which I expected but the neck strap is narrow and it tends to really pull on your neck after the first 20-30 minutes. I can deal with that but today the rivet heads for the back belt started breaking off. I've lost two rivets on the belt and there is only three holding it to the apron. I can fix this by installing some new rivets but the apron was a Christmas gift. I would expect, for the price, this would give me several years of service before this happens. By the way, I'm not a fat guy. I am tall and lean so the belt has absolutely no strain on it what so ever. I am now wondering how many more rivet heads will start breaking off. I guess I had better stock up on rivets for the future. Because of the rivet issue I would not recommend purchasing this apron until the manufacture addresses this problem. Other than that, it is a great apron. I wish I could say it was 5 star.<br />  Today, 8 months later, the spring snap that holds the back belt for your waist broke. Now I have to replace that. This is discouraging."
2.0,"This is a very cheaply made garment. The edging is not tacked down so it opens up as part of the front of the robe. Plus, the seller requires $5.47 to return for refund. Too many other choices to be so cheap."
2.0,The sets were so small you couldnt even see them! Not my favorites!
2.0,"We ordered size 6-7 for my 7 yr old who wears size 5-6.  The bottoms and tail were too small - could have fit a 4 yr old.  The top was too big, could have fit a developing 12 yr old. Fabric was thin, soft and color was vibrant.  We would have kept it if it had fit.  The bottom of the tail is open so you can walk or use a monofin.  Would have been nice to have snaps to keep the tail in place when using a monofin."
2.0,The color is beautiful and I like the width and thickness.. the ring is just too big :/ I ordered the single silver in size 5.5 - 6 but it's definitely size 6 - 6.5
2.0,"Nice and cool, but way to small. I got 3x and it only fits my 100 pound girlfriend.<br />As I bought it for me and I weigh 210, it’s way to small."
2.0,Cheap see thru material. Definitely will just be worn around the house and not in public. I ordered 2 sizes bigger and it is short and boxy and arm length is short on me.
2.0,Materials thin and definitely see through and not a fan of the pocket detail on this style dress but I missed the return window.
2.0,"After 2 wears, toe pushed right through. Soft and stretchy and fits well but cheap, thin fabric. Do not recommend if you're even slightly active (I didn't wear them exercising, just under dress boots to work). Waste of money."
2.0,They are very cute but 2 of the &#34;beads&#34;(not sure what else to call them) were fused together so one earring is lopsided.
2.0,Very short body on this jumpsuit.  I sent it back.
2.0,The dress is very well made but the sizing is not up to the mark...runs small it looks more like a top then a dress...thinking of pairing it with white leggings...had taken 2T but I guess it will fit a one year old...
2.0,Not very fashionable but suits the purpose of not tilting down to see the computer screen.
2.0,We bought these goggles for our son who just joined a swim team.  He used them for two practices and one swim meet before they broke.  Not worth it! Now we know to spend a little more for something with better reviews.  We won't be buying these again.
2.0,"Half of the bands were missing the metal bracket as it falls out very easily, luckily I can swap one from band to band based on which color I want to use. But it is very cheap, the connecting part is a very cheap plastic with a very cheap and loose metal attachment that falls out if you're not careful. I personally wouldn't recommend these bands unless they were like 5$ total. I would definitely recommend spending an additional 5-10$ on a better made elastic band that doesn't have missing parts or extremely cheap parts."
2.0,"Really didn't scrunch in the middle like shown,"
2.0,"The material smells really strong and chemically, the material is thin and it doesn't feel like cotton at all."
2.0,The glasses seem to be adequate. The issue is with packaging. I only rec'd one pair of reading glasses. There is no way to make this right so I would use caution when ordering from this vendor.
2.0,"It is awfully uncomfortable, especially at the top. I am 130lbs, 5'4&#34;, 32DD and I bought small size.<br />It is especially uncomfortable in chest area. The shoulders of the dress restrict arm movement a great deal. When I tried lifting my arms, the material would hurt my shoulders.<br />The dress is also very staticky and clings to the legs (no, I wasn't wearing pantyhose) and anything that comes near.<br />2 stars... considering it would fit someone with smaller bra size."
2.0,I am a small person and I look to be about 7 months pregnant in this shirt. The top is tighter and feels a bit snug. The bottom billows out and has absolutely no sinching at all. Instead it just balloons out.<br />If you are pregnant this is great. If not it may make you look super big.
2.0,"Once I took the ring out, I received a metal burr in the finger. I had to dig it out with a safety pin. I think it didn't get cleaned or smoothed out well enough, hence the two stars. The ring looks good but sizing seems too small. I ordered a size 12 and it is too small, but can fit on another finger snugly. I have many different rings and most are size 12 and don't have any trouble with them fitting. I think this product size runs small. I am disappointed in this product because of the burr (someone probably wasn't doing their job, or doing it well enough). It is a good looking ring for sure. If no burr, and sizing fit well, then I would give 5 stars."
2.0,Shirt was boxy & shapeless.
2.0,"There is no waistline, it comes in right under boobs. It made me look like a rectangle that weighs 20lbs more than I do."
2.0,"I bought these glasses as a joke to go with an american flag hat I own. For the price, I suppose I didn't expect much. However, these glasses are made out of excessively cheap materials (mostly plastic, and any metal parts are very thin), I constantly worry they are going to break in two.<br /><br />It's also important to note that the American flag pattern is NOT see-through; these glasses make it hard to actually see what's in front of you, maybe defeating the point of buying them in the first place. I'd avoid these, even if they are a joke gift."
2.0,"Thin, clingy, and shiny material. The white is see through. These were very unflattering."
2.0,This shirt looks cute in the picture but you need to be at least 5’7 to make it work.
2.0,"I have ordered several different brands of underwear from Amazon.  About 50% just don't work for me.  These fall into that 50%.  They look and feel nice at first.  Then after walking around, they start to creep up my backside.  These might work great for you but I am not going to wear underwear that I have to keep pulling out of my crack.  Sorry.  I wanted to like these."
2.0,"I love the natural stones, but when I purchased one set on a different credit card, they charged that with my original order. Then someone else from them charged me again on the card on file. Both were sent together with my other items.<br />The only reason I didn't dispute it was because I was able to use both sets to make them match better. However, the rubber O rings irritate my ear lobes and they kinda blister and sting so I have to wear my plugs without them and hope they don't pop out. The groove for the O rings is quite shallow to begin with."
2.0,"The original dress I received was 65 cotton/ 35 polyester and fit perfect. However, it had a small hole in it so amazon sent a replacement of the same size. The second dress was the same size but a different material. It is 95 polyester/5 spandex. It is extremely small! It is much shorter and the waist is much higher. It does not fit at all! I am very disappointed!"
2.0,"Once applied, It dries very quickly although it appears as white and not as a clear covering. I have used a cork renew in the past and it dried clear. This looks like the good old-fashioned Elmers glue. It will do the trick to preserve the cork but it looks off."
2.0,I do not like the way the pants sit on the hips. Not comfortable and having to pull up constantly. Draw string does not help. Will not be purchasing again.
2.0,"I thought this might fit me if I went to the highest size (I wear 32 inch waist on almost everything), I was wrong.<br /><br />The design is interesting, I think the mesh on the top of the thong band in back looks a little weird and the openings in the front could maybe be breathable and sexy if it were meant to fit a regular american male waist and genitalia."
2.0,Way smaller than anticipated. The prongs on it are sharp so they pull on my hair.
2.0,"I still wear them, but the fur inside comes apart and gets all over everything."
2.0,I’ve had this model for some time now. When I got these it feels like it’s already stretched out a bit.
2.0,I did the measurements and I was a spot on large. Dress was snug but looked great. However half way thru the party the zipper busted. I’ll be returning this.
2.0,"The tint shows a reflection of my eyeball back at me.  I also doubt there effectiveness as to blocking UV, they are just dark."
2.0,"It will hold a hat’s re-shaping, but over time the very thin nozzle clogs, any nothing comes out."
2.0,The product runs a little small and tight. It is comfortable. The only thing I am unhappy about is that the straps snapped on me after putting it on for the second time and I am unable to exchange it.
2.0,Bad fit!
2.0,"These are cute, but not what I ordered. These are way too short."
2.0,The sweater is not a regular XXL
2.0,I honestly just bought this t-shirt to wear to work. I like to be comfortable and loose-fitting clothing so I can easily move around and not get uncomfortable. Over all this shirt just slightly comfortable. The fabric is not the softest but it's okay. The reason why I took out some extra Stars was because after the first wash the neck had stressed out and now looks like an old shirt.
2.0,"I have an XL head and if a hat is big on me it's probably going to be too big on you. Rolled up once it still has a ton of room at the top, but that's not why I don't like it. The material is really poofy and it it just doesn't look right. I was hoping for a slimmer, tighter, fitting watch cap. This just looks sloppy to me."
2.0,The color of this cardigan is a muted mauve. Not exceptionally pretty. The fit is boxy and somewhat oversized. It is not a flattering cardigan.
2.0,The hat is made cheaply.
2.0,Decal on a very thin material. I can't imagine the decal will last very long at all. Feels very cheap to me. I returned it for a refund.
2.0,"its cute but there's nothing special to this set. Its just plain, cheap stretchy fabirc."
2.0,"This was the least expensive Santa suit we could find, and we got what we paid for. It fits my son perfectly (who is a men’s size small in pants) so this will not fit an adult man and have room for any extra padding. It also is put together with a basting stitch (single thread, very large stitches) and my son had seams ripped before he could even finish trying it on. I had to resew all the seams for it to be safe to wear. It is going to work for our purposes but would be careful if you can’t sew or are larger."
2.0,It don’t fit right for everybody it say x-large but I personally think it’s all the same size or weird sizing it’s cute. Have to find a creative way to wear it . Buy at your own risk.
2.0,"Purchased this for my 19 year old son.  He wears a size Men's small in everything.  The vendor contacted me when I placed the order and asked me to measure his chest because they had been having sizing issues.  I sent his chest size and received the men's small as ordered.  However, where it doesn't fit is the arm length.  The arms stop about 4-5 inches from his wrist."
2.0,"Pretty, but it's a little see see-through and has no pockets."
2.0,Bought it a large and it was way to small for the bottom. I was disappointed because it really is a nice bathing suit.
2.0,"After washing these undies a few times the elastic waistband started fraying on more than half of them. It’s the worst kind of fraying like when you pull to rip off the dangling pieces and the whole waistband unravels, string and elastic. They looked good quality and are cute designs even fit good but this is very frustrating!"
2.0,It was ok not what I expected
2.0,I would have given this a 5 star if I had gotten one for each foot.
2.0,Does not stay fastened.
2.0,Was looking forward to these glasses but frame was bent. Still going to order another pair just disappointed.
2.0,"Fabric super thin. like a cheap,  thermal underwear shirt for a man. Profoundly disappointed."
2.0,"They need to rework their description. What was wanted, what was described and what was needed diverged from what was sent. Not worth my time to do anything but warn others off."
2.0,"Good quality, but sizing runs nearly 2 sizes smaller"
2.0,"I ordered this ring because it was beautiful online and in person. I got this ring on Oct 6, 2021 and today is Nov 3, 2021 and my ring already is turning yellow/brownish. My disappointment of my ring. This has never happened before and it ain't the first ring I bought from Amazon. So I don't understand why it started to look nasty. I don't want to recommend a ring and it'll start turning nasty after a couple of weeks. Bummer."
2.0,Itchy. Son won’t wear it.
2.0,Would have been nice if the description was true. This is baby size links. Should say its for kids Shm!
2.0,"Cut too large for me.  Also, I felt the shirt was a poor value."
2.0,The ring seemed very nice when I received it much thicker than it looks in the picture however it almost instantly turned my finger Green.
2.0,I ordered Small. I am 5'0 and 130lbs. Fits tight from the arms. Not like the picture shows it where its loose from the arms. It's short. Recc size up for a loose fit.
2.0,"Works of course. But unlike other watches, the face is too small for me to read some of it, even with reading glasses. And the buttons are too small also."
2.0,This sweater is ugly in person. The yellow is a hideous shade.
2.0,I ordered a medium first it' was too big so I ordered a small one and there the same size unfortunately
2.0,"Poorly fitted and looks cheaply made. My husband was disappointed. He's a pretty tall guy, but the cap makes him look like a toddler wearing an adult's cap, it's hideous."
2.0,Would have been 5 stars but the rhinestones were detached and dangling over the lens when i received them.
2.0,The color is more of an orange/coral than it is the color in the picture. I also paid for two day shipping and it took the dress 5 days to get here.
2.0,"I ordered thinking that they fit like a large, but they fit like a medium."
2.0,I wish i would have read the reviews.  I didnt like the material used.  I thought it would be more of a t shirt material.  I disliked the material so much i didnt even try it on and i stuffed it in the bag of clothes to give away.
2.0,This fit very oddly. You can tell from the pictures that it has a high-low cut to the bottom but it was very strange to wear.  The size seemed right but it was very short in the front and flared out on the sides which made my hips look enormous.  I would have returned it but I had washed it and cut out the red ribbon which was not fully attached on the ends and had frayed in the wash.  I put it in our goodwill pile.
2.0,Although I did like the coat the zipper always comes apart ok nice the coat is on. Not good. The hight is 29 inches and weight is 18 pounds.the graph doesn't have those measurements for me to post
2.0,"I purchased a dress with short sleeves and got a dress without sleeves, and the dress/Lacey part is sown wrong it's all lopsided!"
2.0,"I was not please with this purchase. The zipper does not work popertly. So I simply can't use it even in good faith. It is totally annoying to close the zipper compartmernt. Especially in high traffice  locations. However, if wasn't for the zipper it is a nice handbag."
2.0,Pros<br /><br />1.Light weight<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />1.Cards don't fit in the slots properly.<br />2.Bad quality material<br />Better to spend those extra 5 bucks and buy a better one like Tommy
2.0,"loved it, came back to buy another one and I just discovered that you guys sell two and not one, so basically you guys gave me half of what it was promised"
2.0,Wings break easily
2.0,It looks like the shirt is sewn inside out. So strange and would NOT recommend.
2.0,"I bought these for my 4 year old son. This was his first time playing soccer and we did not want to make a large financial commitment. These cleats were affordable, cute and his favorite color; red. Unfortunately after  1 practice he complained that they were very uncomfortable. The cleats look tiny but they were his size.  The laces were annoying and regularly came untied and they were small in all ways. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than his standard shoe and if I wanted them to last I would have had to order a full size and a 1/2 larger. I would recommend  an alternative cleat."
2.0,I ordered a large solid light gray. The color looks nothing like the picture. Mine looks like a washed up very light cream color. Plus the pockets make my hips look wider. Idk if I’m gonna return it for a different color. It’s comfy and soft
2.0,"Fell apart about 2 hours into light use. Had to throw out because I was already out, or I would’ve sent back for a refund. Disappointed but was cute for a bit."
2.0,I love the style and the cz's clarity but the post and closure are of poor quality. They're difficult to close properly
2.0,This dress is beautiful but way too short. More for juniors.
2.0,"I was generous with 2 stars based on the great patriotic design & the very low price. Both things I appreciate very much.<br />Because of the low price, keep your expectations LOW on the quality. Also, the zipper is on the wrong side so i struggle to use it LEFT HANDED. May seem like a small problem but it’s frustrating.<br />But again, LOVE LOVE LOVE the design. It’s ALMOST a great jacket. 🚂#AmericaFirst🇺🇸"
2.0,Cheep and cheesy.
2.0,Too much spandex. So much stretch that they don't feel like cotton. If you like them stretchy then they may be good practical sock. Simple and thin with a low profile seam. Would have kept them if the percentage cotton were higher.
2.0,"Bought this dress in a large, was way too short. The only part that covered my butt was the bottom fringe portion of the dress."
2.0,"Exspensive for something made so cheap. Watch out for the front pocket, it will come loose from the seam."
2.0,Not to happy one side came with a scratch on the lens.
2.0,Kinda cute n nice but size way big
2.0,"Cheap quality, bought a small and its huge, and see through. Good for a summer throw over pool tank top, but not much else."
2.0,This costume didn’t look like the picture. Gauze was tough and fit was awful.
2.0,"Gave them to my girlfriend at the time.  I ordered these one size up than I was supposed to and they were still like daisy dukes on me.  Fit great at the waist, but fit horrible everywhere else."
2.0,"I originally wrote a decent review for this bag, as I really enjoy the look and feel of it. Unfortunately, now, after only two months, the hardware which connect the bag to the messenger strap have broken, from normal wear. Please note the attached photo. Although I have only included a photo of one clasp, both have broken, rendering the &#34;messenger&#34; part of this messenger bag useless.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I bought the bag for an event, allowing me to easily carry around various items and books that I would acquire; and it worked excellent for the weekend.<br /><br />Moving forward, I enjoyed the bag and missed the multi purposefulness of a messenger bag, and decided to use it as an everyday bag. I've used it the last few weeks, and only have one real complaint: I wish the front buckles were heavier, making them more prone to holding down the front flap.<br /><br />Other than that, it works great! I like that inner pockets (there basically three separate ones, with the center one having padding - great for a laptop! As well as an inner zippered pocket, and an outer Zippered pocket as well. The front pockets are also handy for holding items you want easy access to, but they are deep enough that nothing falls out. I keep a journal on one side and the other is good for keys or a wallet."
2.0,"Looks mega cheap...if the lady does not like it, it WILL surely be returned."
2.0,The necklace is pretty but not comfortable at all and the earrings did not come with backs
2.0,bracelet lasted barely a month with normal daily wear-not as durable as the round prong set bracelets I have purchased from this seller. Bottom line: I won't buy this particular style/shape bracelet again.
2.0,"These bands are just okay. The colors are not as vibrant as pictured and they became cloudy within a week or two, that was switching out the colors each day. 😕 I wanted to return but it was too late."
2.0,"We didn't the Black pair, only two gold pairs so cannot try both colors.<br />We have tried the gold ones and they seem way too light for daytime if looking for blocking bright sunlight. We will try the gold ones at night, but as for daytime sunglasses, these aren't good at all!"
2.0,Order a size bigger.<br />They came to my ankles. Not over shoes as shown in pictures.
2.0,I bought a similar product and thought these were the same. The fabric is the same but the size is not. I ordered the same size as previous product and these run about two sizes smaller. Returned!
2.0,Loose threads<br />Open seams<br />Bad stitching
2.0,"The hat is cute but the first sunny day we had here in Michigan when I put it on my daughter I found the toggle that sinches the hat to size was broke, so unless I tie the drawstring the hat is worthless even before the 1st use."
2.0,"Although the costume is fairly accurate, it's pretty roughly done. Even if you order a size XXL you'll get gloves sown onto the sleeves for a size small which don't fit my hands at all. There is of course the issue of it being a ""Onesey"" with no pocket hole to do your business through. Makes going to the bathroom nearly impossible. Why don't they make them in 2 sections?<br />Don't buy it unless you can hold you pee forever."
2.0,I'm sure the glasses perform their assigned duty quite well when they can be worn. The problem is they were way to small to wear. The product description is pathetic. I really don't understand why these companies can't properly describe the products they try to sell! Item was returned for a full refund.
2.0,"When it is working, it works great. But it has the same problem with random factory resetting regardless of settings or a full battery level that can be read about all over the web. I bought the 3500 to replace a PRW3000 that was having the same issue and am pretty fed up with Casio. Don't think I'll be buying another watch from them."
2.0,"Very fake looking glasses, and not oversized either and thw mirror is low quality."
2.0,I had really been looking forward to recieving this.<br /><br />Visually it appeared as described. However I found the toe ring itself insubstantial and to flexible. My concern is that with adjustments as needed it would soon break. Color me disappointed.<br /><br />I'll be returning it. 😥
2.0,I was disappointed to receive my item damaged!!!!
2.0,Delivery was fast. They hoops are very big. They are too big to wear in my opinion...
2.0,"the color shown reflects red, the hat is more purple and the flowers more pink in person, Im not happy with it"
2.0,Sadly these run VERY small. Very disappointed.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:84d9178fe5f2ede83460a0b992c47123]] My son loves the design and the soft feel although there was one defective sock in the pack which was a bummer bc we really like how comfortable and cozy these socks are and the designs are super cute. Would have given 5⭐ but disappointed about the one sock 🤷‍♀️
2.0,"Tons of fun in concept but really difficult to get the antlers filled enough to function while sitting on a kid’s head because the valves let the air out before you can get them closed.<br /><br />I bought 4 and have inflated 3 antlers and 12 rings, so it’s not an isolated issue."
2.0,Very difficult to tie to look like the picture. Did not work at all for me. Looked cheap.
2.0,"I ordered this in blue and black. the blue fits an adult the black fits a child. dimensions should be included in description. i initially though the black i received was defective, so i returned it and ordered another. same results could not pull it over my head!!"
2.0,"Item arrived in good condition as described in listing. Nice little compact case.<br /><br />After 2 weeks of use, one of the nose pads has already fallen off."
2.0,Ran way to small. If your kids don't eat and have bird ankles...they might zip up.
2.0,"Sneakers were very stiff, very hard to even get on."
2.0,Cheat fabric
2.0,the dress is really pretty but the fabric is way too thin.
2.0,"It is hard to pull out the crown to adjust date and day. It is also date/day not move smooth when turn counter clock. The band is not real leather as it said, bottom band make by plastic not leather, top of band unsure made by leather. Also the band is hard and difficult to wear on wrist. Do not really like it. Only 1 day do not know how good it moves.<br />I returned all 2 watches because its quality not meet my expection"
2.0,Looks beautiful but runs small. Does not give much room in the bust area as the photo implied.
2.0,"Assumed the picture that the star pattern would be all over, but it was only on the top. The bottom of the sock was all white except for the brand name on huge letters. Also, apparently the socks have to be left out in natural light to &#34;charge them&#34;. I left them in our living room for a day, but that apparently wasn't enough and I had to put them by the window. Glow in the dark was pretty bright at first, but was pretty much gone after 10 minutes. The two stars is mostly in annoyance with the white bottom though which I think would get dirty very quickly and the glow-in-the dark is so-so. Fine for $3 socks, not $10."
2.0,Turned my wrist green after a week. Started flaking off within the week. Not sure its worth the money.
2.0,Cheap material. Had to make my own button whole. Lol. I mean I'll still wear them but I'd wear them more so on a regular day rather than going out for the night. You get what you pay for😏
2.0,The color rubbed off on my under shirt and skin
2.0,"I have wider than normal palms that caused one glove to rip at the seam of the cuff while putting it on. I used the fitment guide and measured my hands but it still happened. I still use the gloves and they work fine. Had my wife sew the seams, will see how well it works out. I wish they offered a size with wider palm and shorter fingers, like golf glove sizing. Those with long narrow hands will fit better."
2.0,"f i want to start off with saying, it was extremely difficult to put on and keep from falliing , it dosent exacly look like the picture,and im still debating wether i want a refund or not."
2.0,Very thin masks! I should’ve just ordered the ones I previously had.
2.0,"I ordered a black one while ago and was just perfect, so I decided to ordered a different color, but it came with a small hole. And also I didnt like the look was kind of baggy.  But nice color and lightweight."
2.0,Not great work out tops. I returned them
2.0,I thought this would be better quality and it was definitely not.  When I got it the strap to hang it up was not attached on one side.  There was also a hole in the stitching on the side of the robe about thigh height.  The material was fine I just thought it would look like it was already worn a year!  Would not recommend.
2.0,"Didn’t really work well for me, fits well in the legs, but too tight in the stomach. Also not useful to wear as ski pants because the pants don’t go over your ski boots."
2.0,"Used it for 2 weeks, then one day I forgot it inside my car, parked in sun.<br />The next day it was deformed and wrinkled.<br />I guess once you leave in the inside heat of car, it becomes dead. Not a very useful product if you have to carry this bulky stuff around outside and cannot leave inside car in sun, given that it is only for car use."
2.0,These masks are made for smaller faces like children or petite people.
2.0,"This was so cute, but broke so quick."
2.0,"color is not what is shown, size to small. Bought bigger then what I wear and still can't fit it. Very disappointed"
2.0,"Such high hopes...  fabric is thicker than I expected, and dress is made well, but it's huge!  I'm 5'6&#34;, 125 lbs, usually a size 4, and small was very large on me.  Wish there was a XS, because the style is just what I wanted!"
2.0,"I do like the bracelet, but the photos and wording are quite misleading.  Although it shows 4 sets of bracelets, you only get one set.  You don't get the choice as to which one you get, but it's still a nice set of bracelets."
2.0,"I am a solid Medium...I like my clothes loose fitting and oversized so typically buy clothing a size up. When this arrived, this fit like a Small. It's very form fitting and looks nothing like the photos. It definitely runs small, and definitely can't be a dress on me (i'm 5'6). The sweater is thick, warm, and a little stiff. I can imagine it being a little scratchy around the seems as well. I don't want the hassle of returning this, so I'm gifting this to my niece in high school...she would fit this a lot better than me."
2.0,Please make the band more secure. This is the second gear fit watch in which the band has come apart or just broke off. Everything else works great but the band is HORRIBLE.
2.0,Short. Im 5'8 and it wasn't long enough
2.0,A little to small for my package.  Wasn't worth sending back.
2.0,"Waited the long wait, got it and was so excited until I opened it. Cute little charms, nice coloring but the chain was broken. Simple fix, just fasten back on, right? Nope, can't wear cause it keeps breaking."
2.0,"I ordered this coat a size up (L) from my normal size, (M) based on other reviews and experiences buying clothes online.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had to return because the way this coat is shaped made it both too big and too small at the same time. The back panel is fine, but the side panels where the sleeves are, those are cut way too narrow and the pockets end up almost at your lower back. It also causes the material at the back to feel too loose.<br /><br />Gave 2 stars because the material seemed to be good quality, and I received a timely refund response from Amazon for the return. I was excited by the style of this coat, if they improved the pattern I'd consider trying it again."
2.0,"Update: It is a beautiful bracelet and I loved it, but unfortunately after only a few wears one of the elastic bands broke. Now it's pretty loose and I'm reluctant to wear it as it may break completely. Disappointed."
2.0,"It looked really loose in the pictures, so I ordered a size smaller.  It's still pretty loose, but that is the sought after fit.  I really, really love this blouse.  I'm wearing it to work today.  The color (green) is really beautiful and is exactly as shown in the photo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the quality of the shirt wasn't great for me. I have another shirt by the same seller, and it's great, but this one had a huge hole in the side."
2.0,The print is really cute and it fits ok but the zipper is a nightmare and the fabric stretches out and sags/wrinkles within a couple hours of wear. The elasticity returns with washing but it's annoying still.
2.0,"The way the mask is made, it is difficult to arrange it so you can read the message on it."
2.0,"fit is very untrue to size and im super bummed cause the dress itself is actually so pretty. it's so small, so tight in the arms, and just looks cheap and overwhelming."
2.0,This did not fit on my ear very well and I ended up just throwing it away. You must have VERY LARGE ears for this to fit well.
2.0,"Ordered the light blue in a L (5’5” and 160 lbs) and I absolutely loved it! Fit great, nice color, soft and cozy…liked it so much I ordered a light gray and it was such a disappointment the fit was same other than the band around the bottom was way smaller so it didn’t zip up unless I brought it up above my hip area and looked so weird when I did! Didn’t wanna deal with return so gave it to my mom who is smaller and can wear it but it’s just so disproportionate"
2.0,Loved this sweater when it arrived and fit perfectly but the length after the first cold water wash.
2.0,"Cute, but not for me! I’m 5’7”, 110lbs and I felt like I was drowning in it, even it being a Small. Red is way brighter than pictured, being more like the shade of a cheap lipstick rather than a pretty tomato red. I’ll be returning this for sure!"
2.0,"The top fits really weird! Ended up returning it for a different style. I am a 36DD, 5'6'' and about 180lbs. The fringe part was also kind of weird. Kept rolling up and I feel like it would have bugged me! Maybe a good suit style for a slimmer body"
2.0,These are very cheap and some of the screws are lined up wrong.
2.0,"Too small on my shoulders, even when I ordered a larger size!"
2.0,"This is a little smaller that a dime, I purchased for my husband and he used readers glasses to see all 3 signs on it.  He thought that vit would be a bit larger."
2.0,was to baggy on me
2.0,Fit is good. However the colors are brighter in person. It’s flowy but I think it would’ve look nicer and sexier if it wasn’t so flowy.
2.0,"Very uncomfortable, not all all up to Skechers quality.  Very cute, but Skechers really needs to modify the comfort."
2.0,"This product is absolutely crappy. The &#34;turquoise&#34; is just a plastic piece that is glued into the center, it doesn't even go to the edges of the &#34;gold&#34; border around it. Really disappointed. I ended up giving to my niece as costume jewelry."
2.0,"It's just a square of cotton gauze, it's not formed into a cowl.  If it weren't for the two pins I would have said it's cheaper to buy 2 yards of cotton gauze."
2.0,"Once again, something from China that has no labels on it and is not a US XL."
2.0,Much larger then I was expecting
2.0,My wife finds this not as convenient as the arm wallet. It  does not feel good on her leg. She will stay with the arm walllet
2.0,It didn’t look like the picture :/ it holds my pants up though so I guess it does the job
2.0,"I bought this in a large for my friend, she couldn't even get them up half way before they ripped. She tossed them, it seems like these are one size even though it gives choices for size"
2.0,"Nice pattern and color, nice lining in front and crotch, but the cut is very weird. The leg holes were extremely tight and cut into my lady lumps in the worst ways; see pics. The area that should be tight however, the neck hole, gaped in an unattractive way. The pic actually minimizes the gape. In reality the neckline looks as it it were stretched out, giving it a sloppy appearance.<br /><br />Few people will mind the thin fabric since it is lined in the important areas, and the sleeve length is appropriately proportioned. The cut however makes this suit suitable for gals with very thin legs and perhaps thicker necks or wider shoulders to stretch the neck area."
2.0,These are not designed for my big melon. I wear a 7 1/4 hat and these things come nowhere near fitting me. The arms are very flimsy. I couldn't wear them long enough to see if they'll break but they're built like a toy.
2.0,"I was very upset that this product broke after I bought it and gave it as a gift to someone, it was beautiful when I took it out of the packaging but unfortunately it broke on my friends wrist after only wearing it a few times"
2.0,A few of them broke just from me taking them off of the package they came on. They look cute but I’m sad that I won’t be able to use some of them
2.0,Great material and fast shipping but the image is very pixelated.
2.0,"UPDATE: I had to drop a couple stars because while cute, the strength of the pins (as mentioned in initial review below) made for them often falling off & some even got lost as a result.<br />---original review below---<br />These are cute. Gift purchase I'm sure will be loved. The backs could stand to be a bit stronger & straight (crooked pinch points)."
2.0,"Cute bracelet, but it fell apart in less than 3 months of normal wear."
2.0,Not ideal for a face mask because the clips rub against your ears.
2.0,hard to gauge the size on amazon
2.0,i ordered tthis mala...recieved it quickly...put it on...then it broke and beads rolled everywhere...i guess you git what you pay for...
2.0,Bummed this didnt fit as expected. Tight through the arms and chest.
2.0,The soles of the boots started coming off on first day of wear. - looked like cork board. They’re very cute but cheaply made.
2.0,This is comfortable but it runs small. Not worth it.
2.0,"This is a beautiful band, however, after a couple months it turned my wrist green."
2.0,"It is cute but unfortunately doesnt stay where its supposed to . No matter how tight i tie, it keeps sliding off, defeats the purpose of over the knee boots. I don't recommend"
2.0,"Pics: my jeans versus these leggings. Initially I was upset that I was sent a child's pants. Then I remembered these are 'compressional' which I presume means 'like compression.' My mom had DVT (a clot) in her legs and had to wear compression stockings. I remembered how tight and small her stockings were and after verifying the label on these leggings confirmed they're for women, I decided I'd try them on. Get ready for a work out. Hopefully you're not in a hurry because you're not leaving your house anytime soon. If you managed to get your foot through without getting stuck in the holes on the side of the calves, you're off to a good start. You haven't even gotten to the hard part yet - try pulling them up above you knees lol. You can do it, but it's a stretch - literally and figuratively. The compression seems to cease at the butt, so there's some relief. But where it ends there will be a weird fit. I can't wear these, not for casual wear anyway. I think these should be sold with medical stockings. These missed the mark for me."
2.0,Lasted about two months and then the watch stopped ticking/keeping time.  Gold flake of paint from the gears came loose inside.
2.0,Runs very very small small
2.0,"was too small, very hot and cheap material used."
2.0,WHEN I PUT IT ON THE LITTLE HOOKS STRETCHED OUT AFTER ONE TIME OF USING IT.......NOT VERY TIGHT FOR IT TO DO THAT
2.0,"When I found this shirt they had it listed as a cotton/polyester blend, but when it arrived the tag shows 100% cotton on it."
2.0,"Cute, but not made for babies with chunky feet.  My 10 month old would have fit into a size 6 to 12 months if the tongue opened more to be able to slide his foot into the mocassins."
2.0,"Quality of the product seems fine, but the size was far too small to fit over my backpack, despite selecting the right volume listed. I can get most of my backpack covered but it's a pain now to use."
2.0,I ordered this as a gift to give to someone. It's a nice simple gift that says a lot. The smaller ring that connects the heart to the key ring seems to be weak and has fallen off the key ring. I just attached the heart to the actual key ring because it kept falling off.
2.0,"My friend absolutely loved this hat, but was upset when the Sloth started to come off only a couple of days of wearing it. That's why I gave it two stars. I got it for her mainly for the sloth. The fabric was good and it was adjustable."
2.0,Very sharp corners negated the beauty of this! One corner was sharp enough to cut skin.😢
2.0,Photo makes it look better than in real life. Nice design but diamonds are virtually undetectable. Has a bit much thickness between fingers. Tapered back for a comfort fit is a plus. Returned it because it looked cheap.
2.0,It was a little small to my liking
2.0,"We got this when it had mostly positive reviews which we now realize were probably fake... The luggage broke quickly. It had been our first time using it, and we checked the larger one only to find that the wheel was already breaking before we even got it on the plane! To our dismay, when it came out of the carousel, it was cracked.<br /><br />High quality luggage or even medium quality luggage usually lasts more than a *single* trip. I'd highly recommend finding something else. This seems to be a scam."
2.0,"Those ARE NOT! the same glasses I purchased before. Bad materials, they feel like the metal parts are bad kind of recycle stuff I I believe in recicling but not in making metal is gonna broke in one week. Not purchaising this particular set again."
2.0,Wish they came in a smaller size
2.0,"The product was ok for a while then the colored piece came out,, hopefully this won't happen with the others"
2.0,"They are so beautiful, it breaks my heart not to be able to wear them. I usually wear a 9 to a 9 1/2. I ordered a 10 and I can't even get them on, the arch is too narrow. I don't usually have to wear a wide width shoe. If they had them available in a wide width I would try again because I love them but unfortunately they don't."
2.0,Not what we needed.
2.0,"I ordered a medium because that’s what I wear in tops. This top was made with pretty good quality and came sooner than estimated which was good, but it was small. I gave it to my 12 year daughter to wear as a cute top with some leggings. Will probably have to order two sizes up. 🤔"
2.0,Not the length as pictured nor the quality expected. Almost a sheer material. A bit disappointed
2.0,"The dress arrived all rumpled up in a plastic bag. The dimensions are not as pictured: the middle and bottom of the dress are a lot shorter---it fits like a long shirt, definitely not like a dress. The top part fits fine, and is cute; the measurements for the length are just too short and do not go to mid thigh as pictured. Returning it."
2.0,it frame just broke after I fixed a new lenses. I dont have a choice I have to buy another one because I already got same lenses. what a waste!!!
2.0,"The dress looked pretty online and the reviews were good. I am very self-conscious and have a hard time finding anything that I feel comfortable in. The reviews and cut of the dress appeared as though it would be a nice casual sundress for someone who is curvy and rather bottom heavy. I usually find that clothing that it more fitted on top flatters me more. I was excited when it arrived and my husband liked the print. Tried it on and was so disappointed! The fabric did not feel nice at all, more like cardboard, had an odd odor (had to wash twice to get rid of it), and was not as bright as the photos. The empire waist hits at a funny place, not where an empire should, and the top is more loose than the bottom. Finally, the pockets make the dress poof out in a funny way. Needless to say,I will not be buying from this vendor again as their ads and measurements are not true to the item. Might work and did look cute in some reviews, but you do get what you pay for."
2.0,The wife bought this for Christmas. It winds the watches perfect. The downside. It's noisy and I mean you have to keep it another room behind a closed door kind of noisy.  So now it just sits unplugged as a overpriced display case.
2.0,I'm just a little disappointed the light bulb it's not as gray as it appears to be on the photos it looks like it's tan... the graphic with a contents spilling out of the light bulb doesn't look anything like the photo in my opinion so I don't think I got my money's worth the quality of the T-shirt feels nice though.
2.0,"The product is as described but it gave me the most awful rash on my wrist. I'm not really a sensitive-skinned person, but this was terrible."
2.0,The metal part fell off after couple months of use.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Hugs in the wrong places and is not cute as I had hoped. I have to return and I hate that they charge for shipping especially since I paid for expediated shipping.
2.0,I received two “writes” when it’s supposed to be one earring says “read” and one says “write” I like the earrings but the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a “read” and a “write”
2.0,"The fact that this product says “plus size” is crazy.  I ordered a size up and it was so tight.  I would definitely suggest to size up by 2 sizes if you’re looking to be able to breathe while wearing this dress.  Otherwise, it would be super cute!"
2.0,"Design was advertised as on front of shirt, but was on the back of it."
2.0,These gloves did not fit my 6 year old at all. They were about an inch too long in the fingers. They are too tight and short for an adult. So frustrating at a time like this. 😤
2.0,"Ordered a set of flags for our 8U team. Played one game, 3 of the belts shredded (came apart) at the seam.  I can’t say if this brand was bad or we just got a few unlucky belts. Not very happy about it."
2.0,The fabric doesn’t feel too durable. I just got mine and it’s already unstitching. Rating two starts because the picture itself is cute.
2.0,Order a smaller size. And they are very wide.
2.0,I ordered the size according to the chart parented. It is way too small and about three inches from zipping up at all. You size chart is very wrong.
2.0,"It's nice but very fragile. The first day I got it, the metal it's my birthday piece broke off the headband. I had to reglue it back on. Which, was a pain. Nice enough, but don't plan on having it for long if you buy it."
2.0,"The first time i ordered this, it was never delivered as lost. The when i finally got it, fabric is very thin and faded. Runs really small"
2.0,"Saw the dress online with my daughter and she was so excited.... after receiving the dress, I was a little disappointed. Unfortunately, several flowers which give the dress character  fell off just after removing it from the packaging.  They are not stitched on unfortunately."
2.0,Fit like a  medium and smelled like cigarettes
2.0,Very small.Nice earrings cute in style not big in size
2.0,"I ordered a large based on the pics & reviews but it was too big. However,  even if it fit, I wasn't a fan. It looked liked sequins sewn onto a velour jacket (tried to take a pic)  And was itchy. I'll be returning."
2.0,It’s thing material and it fits but it’s extremely clingy
2.0,"The shape of the necklace is nice.  However, the stone looks almost black!  It does not look at all like a sapphire and will not go with the dress I am planning to wear to my sister's wedding.  Quite disappointed!"
2.0,"This works pretty well as a stop gap messure but the leather is pretty thin, as in why does this cost that much thin.( maybe 5 sheets of paper thin)<br /><br />The only thing that MIGHT be redeeming is the band adapter they put the leather band on.  I might end up seeing if I can replace the leather band at my local watch shop with something a bit more sturdy than what was provided with it.<br /><br />Edit 2/25/2017: The seller sent me an email with the following:<br /><br />&#34;Hello [REDACTED]<br />I am so sorry you are not satisfied with our products.<br />I suggest that you can make a refund.<br />We will send back your money.<br />Hope you can remove the feedback.<br />Many thanks<br />Yavive&#34;<br /><br />1. the return window closed on Jan 31, 2017.  (I put this review up way after)<br />2. The seller didn't read the review and only saw the 3 star rating.<br />3. I just dropped the rating down to 2 stars due to copy paste responses filling up my inbox.<br /><br />Trying to haggle me?  Another copy paste response of asking to return/refund it will drop it down to one (1) star.  Make note of the review and improve on your products.  Don't bug people outside of the return window to return it because the company doesn't want the bad review on their product page."
2.0,"For reference I am 5'2&#34;, 140lbs, I typically wear a medium in dresses, and I wear a 36DD bra. Aware that Asian brand sizes typically run one size smaller, I ordered this dress in the LARGE and in the color blue. The fabric is very lightweight and pretty.. the blue is dark with off-white flowers accented with a bit of a burgundy/red color. The dress fits, but I have heavily pear-shaped body and I found this dress to flow rather oddly over my thighs. It doesn't bother me a great deal, it isn't awfully unflattering but I though I might mention that. Unfortunately the dress is too long on me, but  I know how to hem so I will fix that myself and I will most likely try to fix the two side slits as they hit at a very awkward length (about mid calf) instead of going up the leg like they are suppose to. Overall, it's a pretty dress and will hopefully look much better on me after sewing. For anyone interested in buying this dress be aware it's important to order a size up and keep in mind that the dress might require some sewing adjustments due to the length and/or the slits.<br /><br />UPDATE (5/20/18): I just noticed the top of the dress is sewn rather unevenly and there are ravelings coming from the armpit areas. Thoroughly unimpressed with the quality of this dress. I would rather order a dozen of the shorter version of this dress from BerryGo then order this one again. Don't think I would recommend."
2.0,I ordered a large and it’s TINY! I had to give it away to my roommate. It would have been nice if it had been anywhere near he size I ordered.
2.0,"The sizes are too small, I think these were made for young Asian boys, buy the extra large if you way more than 150 pounds"
2.0,More like a plastic tablecloth. It’s waterproof but extremely light weight.
2.0,These masks are nice in quality but they are HUMONGOUS.  I genuinely don’t know how I’m supposed to wear this out.
2.0,Cute shirt but it is the widest shirt I've ever seen. I'll give it away.
2.0,"Let me start by saying how much I love these bracelets!! I read reviews and they were hyped as being an everyday piece of jewelry. I put jewelry on and leave it on. Let’s just say that these bracelets are beautiful and comfy but can not live the single mother, artist, teacher lifestyle. The last one broke today and I was heartbroken to see it go. I was really hoping that for the price of these and the fact that they are advertised as an everyday piece of jewelry that they would last. Looks like I will have to find another brand."
2.0,This skirt color was a bit off. The inner skirt is see through and also tight. I really wanted to love this skirt but I had to return
2.0,I am 5’ 11’ and 180 lbs. and wear medium or large in all my clothing. I ordered a large jacket.  It was way too small.
2.0,I used it to exercise and never sweated !
2.0,Small fit ordered for 12 year old
2.0,The collar was ginormous even though I bought {supposedly} the same shirt/size in red. Threw it away.
2.0,"They are decievingly thin! I bought them thinking that they would keep my feet warm and cozy in my boots but they are scratchy and made of flimsy, thin, cheap matieral."
2.0,This does not look anything like the picture it's an actual sticker of the lens cheaply made I would never buy this ever again false advertisement
2.0,I give it two stars because they worked really well but I have only had them a week and one of the straps broke already.
2.0,"The raw hide ties on the moccasins were fake which mean you cannot tighten down the moccasins for a snug fit.<br />Moccasins are really cheap, ended up throwing them away."
2.0,"Had way too high expectations, was not how I imagined. The material was very rough and the sleeves were not the same as in the dress pictured. Was very disappointed, don't recommend it."
2.0,Most of them were ok. They pick the ones you get. Nice and dark boat shades for the most part
2.0,Nice fabric but arms cut way too small
2.0,"The suit was adorable, but I ordered a medium and it was definitely a small."
2.0,"Looked great in Amazon pictures, however the quality is sub-par. Very cheap looking and plastic. Lenses are ok, not great, but not the worst. These would be good for a costume piece, otherwise in real life you'd look like a clown"
2.0,I wore the bracelet for few days and I think the bracelet beads are not genuine Aventurine but the selenite is!
2.0,Need longer ears they are very pretty
2.0,Item is too small. I can’t even fit my chest into it.
2.0,I did not care for the seaming and the material looked like it has been washed a lot. Possible that a plain color wouldn’t have looked like that.
2.0,"Okay. Weird shirt. It's like a sweater-tee. Totally unexpected material and look to it. The fit is poor, very tight on my shoulders and chest (which did show off my build, so there's that), but the torso was very short. It does not come all the way down to my pants, so I have a little midriff poking out like a 90s girl. This will be my last time buying clothing sight unseen."
2.0,I love the look of the ring when I first got it. Which I have only had it 4 days. But it's already started losing the gems and come apart. And they rub my pinky finger raw. I am super disappointed cause I loved the way it looks. Now I can not wear it at all. And I just bought it. Quality is not good if they are all like this. I hope this one is just defective and the company will do the right thing.  Now we sit and wait.
2.0,Item was bulky heavy and fit weirdly
2.0,"I appreciate that someone engineered a better umbrella.  However, it really isn't needed for me.  I use an umbrella maybe three times a year and have many already.  The biggest drawbacks are poor workmanship, way to large for any of my cars.  I prefer a compact styled umbrella but thought I would give it a try.  These umbrellas are very cheaply made.  On one of the umbrellas I bought the button to open and close didn't work all the time.  Many times the umbrella would not stay open. The commercials for this umbrella on TV and many other product do a great job of getting people excited about a product.  People buy these items and then they sit in the closer.  Do yourself a favor and put the money in the bank.  If you already have several umbrellas then I feel this is a waste of time.  If you are buying your first umbrella then spend a little  more to get one that has a better build quality.  I can't recommend this item to you."
2.0,I was not crazy about the material .
2.0,The strap broke the first hour!The pearls started to fall off the second hour!Did get a couple of compliments.It's nice if you only want to look at it.Not very functional for me.
2.0,"This was a tough rating.  I ordered 2 Hakama Uniforms, a large and a medium.  The large came in perfect condition, folded and packaged in a beautifully printed plastic bag with red flowers and with tags and instructions.  If this was the only item ordered, it would have been 5 stars.  The problem is with the medium ordered.  It came rolled in a ball and stuffed in a generic plastic bag that had a warning label for babies and suffocation. There were no tags, no instructions, and no original plastic bag.  Both were listed as new but one was and one was not.  I called Amazon and they said due to low stock, they could not exchange the medium and offered a $20 credit.  So one product was what I paid for and one was not.  This was actually my second order with Edoten so I am extra disappointed.  Whoever stocked the &#34;returned&#34; medium is to blame.  Now I am off to the dry cleaners to see if I can bring this back to life.  If it does not work, both items are being returned since I need 2."
2.0,Cut big.  Was awkward fit
2.0,Very thin material and not long like it suggested. I don't like worrying about my shirt coming up when I'm working out. If you're okay with seeing skin and bra thru then it's a good product. I like mine thicker and to hold shape.
2.0,"The style is cute. The sizing is sooo wrong.  I'm 5'2&#34; 125 lbs, normally a size 8 or Small.  I ordered a Mediium since it looked slightly fitted, following the lines of the body.  It does that, only to the lines of a size 2 body.  I kept it and gave it to my Grandaughter.  Too bad it wasnt near her Bday or Cmas."
2.0,So I thought this product was well designed however it actually runs a little big and should be order a size down. Super sad about this as I thought it would fit and be great for a strapless bra.
2.0,they were hollow and i was expecting solid. poor screw on backs. i replaced mine with regular ear ring backs. i would not recommend this seller.
2.0,Material is comfy but cheap looking.  Ok to work around the house in.
2.0,Ill fitting and why no pockets??
2.0,Honestly the colors were so faded and old school looking I didn't even open the package.
2.0,yikes the sleeves were TIGHT -had to return
2.0,zipper too long ..and strong smell of plastic .
2.0,"This swim suit is gorgeous but it is several sizes too small. If you want to order, I suggest going 3-4 sizes up."
2.0,"This top received 2 stars:  one for the pretty colour, and one for the pattern.  Otherwise, the fabric feels coarse and cheap.  I wear a size 16, and managed to get it on:  just. I'm just 5 ft. tall, and it is a short blouse.  The bow on the back was not cute, and the pocket on the front was decorative rather than useful.  It went back without a second thought."
2.0,This is not slim fit. The quality is extremely poor. It looks different and unique. Good for one use only.
2.0,Tight around the anus area & pockets a scratchy
2.0,"Very disappointed.  The wig was frizzy more than the picture, and didn't fit well.  The sides clearly showed my hair underneath (even with a wig cap).  It was a cheap wig, and it looked cheap :("
2.0,"I love Bico designs... paid a little extra (almost double) for this one, and while the items is good looking and very good quality, it was VERY small... looks like it was made for a 10-year old kid's necklace... company seems good and shipping quick, but if you want something adult sized... look elsewhere."
2.0,Not very good product
2.0,Zipper broke within a month.
2.0,Has gotten really scratchy.
2.0,"I thought it was going to be better, but for 12 bucks what can you expect."
2.0,"Overall, I really liked the watch.  The rose gold and white looked really nice, but the metal clip which holds the band down broke almost immediately making it unusable."
2.0,I wish I could return them... My body doesn't look any better.. just pushes tummy fat up into another area.  Not comfortable.
2.0,"Nice shirt, but it had a small hole in the front."
2.0,"Very long and the purple is very dull and not at all bright like the picture. I also got a blue dress, not black. Blue isn't even an option!"
2.0,I love the picture. It did not look like the picture. It looked cheaper. And it came dirty.
2.0,"The fabric is weird, and the inside is white, instead of patterned. It isn’t what I expected, but it’ll be fine for working out"
2.0,"these were too large. i have a giant head and giant eyes and a giant nose, i am quite literally the largest person i have ever met, but these sunglasses were too big. not stylishly big, not oversized, just comically, clownishly large. so large that i looked small beneath their giant form."
2.0,"Pretty and fits my pandora bracelet, the problem is that 3 months of wear and the color is fading, not durable and wouldn't buy again."
2.0,They r nice but they bend easily . Ive had to buy like 7 of them because they keep bending or the nose piece moves out of place and i cant deal with uneven glasses . Definately cant just throw them in your bag and go .
2.0,I returned this belt. Definitely made for a small person. I'm a 4/6 and this was snug!  Cute enough though.
2.0,Not what I though it would be kinda disappointed
2.0,Ummm we wanted to like this but it was VERY small. We requested a return or an exchange but the seller refused; only apologizing - “sorry it didn’t fit”... thanks for the apology but that doesn’t help me out. So I would seriously think twice before ordering from this seller.<br />The shirt itself is really nothing special. It’s not warm - It’s on the thinner side. It is silky and soft on the outside though. The shirt looks like it’s pictured - just disappointed that it’s basically useless
2.0,Socks are comfortable but one pair came smaller then the rest and one pair my toe went threw the front the first day I pu5 them on . I dobwalk all day and in dress shoes . But should not happen the first day . So not happy with product .
2.0,"The product isn't bad in and of itself, however the fabric is pretty thin but also very heavy (which seems like it doesn't make sense)- this results in the dress drooping pretty badly as the weight of the dress itself stretches and pulls the fabric down. I am normally a size 8-12 (depending on brand), and got a size L, which was a little too big for me. I think this is the type of garment that does not look very good if it doesn't fit perfectly (given the issue that I described), so unfortunately this one got donated."
2.0,Very scratchy material that left my skin itchy after trying on.<br /><br />The asymmetrical shape left one of the sleeves significantly shorter than the other. One sleeve looked to be 3/4 length while the other was full length. Maybe this was why the model has the sleeves pushed up?<br /><br />I really wanted this sweater to work but  overall there are more negative aspects than positive.<br /><br /> * = Returned *
2.0,My husband loved how this fit him but the quality was so poor we had to mend holes in it multiple times and finally just gave up and trashed it.
2.0,"Arrived in a plastic biggie, no big deal. Give it to my woman as a present. Looks real nice. 4 days of wearing it necklace part breaks while eating lunch. Necklace part is junk. Walmart jewelry last longer than this lol."
2.0,It looks good and its strong but its not user friendly. I will never use this bag . I bought a back pak instead.  It doesnt lay on your back well. I hate it. Its useless to have 2 openings.
2.0,"I got these for my daughter, but have since retired them to the draw of masks that didn't work out. These are so cute and fun, but it ends there. There is no shape to them, so they don't stay on the face at all. They constantly fall down (no nose shape at all, so it slips down)."
2.0,"Pink color is more flesh-tone, which didn't look good with my ruddy complexion.  Disappointed.  I wanted baby pink."
2.0,I’m 5’6 and the material is good. It’s only the jacket that is really tight. I don’t know if supposed to be tight like that in the zipper  doesn’t see zip up very good it’s cute but like I want to order another one because this one doesn’t feel right
2.0,This would have been really cute but maybe I got a faulty one. The line was sewn super crooked. It did not fall even at all when on. One side was all bunched up. Maybe I'll order another one and see if it has the same problem. But the fabric was super soft and it was nice and loose to hide my gut.
2.0,Super poor quality. Buckle gave way and dropped my watch off my wrist under light use
2.0,Liked the color. Did not like the way it fit. Runs small.
2.0,Ended up being shorter then I thought. Was tight thought the chest area after I washed it.
2.0,Super thin and see through... It's so short too.. Its not a dress.. But with a tanktop under it i can wear it as a shirt
2.0,"Cute, but it breaks easily.. not good for everyday wear."
2.0,It came with a tear in the first finger on the left hand along the seam. I couldn't send it back because there were none here to buy locally and my daughter needed them yesterday. Make sure to look when you get ours. Not very well constructed.
2.0,Ok if you like to show every lump on your body or have none you might like this shirt. It is 2 sizes too small to even start to fit like the picture. This is a thin spandex tight fit that shows everything.  Not as pictured at all. Terrible unless you are super trim then i can see where it could be cute.
2.0,"I inspected the set, and noticed right away that whatever &#34;free size&#34; meant, it certainly wasn't &#34;one-size fits all&#34;. But, since at the time this combo was $4.99 my expectations were incredibly low. Stitching was fine and the set was true to color. So, I washed it, and it held up nicely in the delicate cycle.  But the fit was awful for night clothes. I suppose if I were very petite this would be perfect, but I'm curvy and this nightie fit more like a clubbing dress. I'll probably use the &#34;robe&#34; as a shawl, because it's soft and doesn't look like pajamas. And, maybe for the hell of it I'll stitch some additional lace to the front of the &#34;gown&#34; and wear if for a night out lol"
2.0,Is to big! Had to return it!
2.0,Runs small. The pants and shirt are snug. I ordered a 4T for my daughter who still fits into some of her 3T clothes & they won’t last through the summer. I dried on delicate too so I can’t blame it on shrinking after wash.
2.0,Doesn't fit as well as expected and material is not very soft
2.0,"Look great, scratch easily."
2.0,Really liked this watch band up until it fell to pieces on me randomly. Couldn’t repair it either. Other than that it was comfortable and looked nice.
2.0,"Lens popped out before my friend even had a chance to put them on.  We were able to snap it back in place, but I wouldn't buy these again."
2.0,The purse was stiff making it hard to use also being such stiff material makes it hard to open up and not user friendly
2.0,the product is beautiful what the fit is awful I ordered two sizes too big and it was still too small in the chest and arms it's like the skirt was made for an adult and the top was made for a child I would really like to know how to return this I'm very disappointed
2.0,"It is very fragile and not good for draping.  It's stiff and poorly made.  Don't buy it. After washing, it did not hold up well."
2.0,The material wasn't what I had expected and the skirt was shorter than I thought it would be.
2.0,These were not as cute as I expected.
2.0,"Was excited to finally get it. There were no sizing/instructions the color was extremely bad. Picture online showed a beautiful red sports bra, yet it was a Salman dull color. There was a tag sewn inside that said xxl. I wear medium, sometimes large"
2.0,Seems like a nice dress but runs small. Trying to get it returned
2.0,Arms were so tight but the shirt is cute so I cut the inside of the sleeve a little so I could still wear.
2.0,"I liked that it is an off shoulder top. However, u have to keep pulling it down. I was a bit disappointed."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:423f3887693419f33011751ecefd0b2]] I love the charms great quality BUT one of the charms came without the back end to plug it into the croc and I’ve reached out to them plenty of times to either get my money back or to to get just the one that was damaged and haven’t heard anything back from them.
2.0,"The D rings are too small, or the leather straps are too wide. Consequently when you try to slide the camera up and down on the strap you encounter a lot of friction and it doesn't slide very well at all. Very unusable can't believe they tried to make a product like this. Also they shipped it with the wrong connectors on it. The camera harness hardware does not match the picture on the item I ordered.  The strap looks nice though.  I am trying out the Black Rapid strap instead."
2.0,The fabric sheds like crazy. I have washed & dried it & hope the shedding is over! I usually wear a 10/12 and bought a large; it fits baggy like I wanted it. It’s warm & cozy.
2.0,Just regular sock. Not enough compression to do anything.
2.0,Llego demasiada pequeña
2.0,"Cheap price wise, but very cheap quality speaking. No worth ordering."
2.0,"Hat looks exactly like the hat in the picture, however it came folded very small and the brim is all bent up. Slightly disappointing but hoping it will flatten out"
2.0,"Okay slippers, but the batteries didn't function as they should. One worked for a very short time; the other never worked. :("
2.0,"The color wasnt close to the color in pic.  I normally wear a medium but ordered a large because I can also wear a large but this size large was very very large on me.  My advice would be to order your regular size.  But do not be fooled by the color in pic.  The actual color looks like a faded out red, yuk!"
2.0,For gift but want give way I thought<br />It was finish
2.0,"Much thinner than my other compression socks by Nurse Mates, barely feel like they work in comparison."
2.0,"Low price, but the presentation and quality is not the best"
2.0,"#1 favorite - Turtle Fur<br />#2 favorite - Smart Wool<br /><br />If this one had a longer neck, it may move up to 2nd place.  Just don't like to keep tuggin down on it.  Even 2&#34; longer would make this WAY more effective."
2.0,I bought this for my husband...It didn't catch or hold much hair.
2.0,"The black band is Ok, the navy one is not wearable - one half is ""turned over"" to the opposite side"
2.0,"This says it's it will fit the Moto360 and it probably will. However the pieces that fit inside the housing of the watch are too big and you really have to force them in there. I tried for a good amount of time and almost go one side in, only to have the pin shoot out when I move the strap to put it on."
2.0,I'm disappointed with this top.  The gathers at the sides accentuate all the wrong parts - I don't really want to draw attention to my bottom!  I thought it would be more like a thin sweater but it's a thin shirt.
2.0,It didn't fit correctly but the return process was good.
2.0,The ears were not glued well and the band for the foot is smaller then the back of shoe. So my daughter can not wear it.
2.0,"I don't know how they determined these sizes, but WOAH!<br />I got 3X when I saw the other reviews.  Leg length isn't an issue.  Just roll that up, right?<br />I am 5'8"" and  weigh 200 lbs.<br />The 3x fit my waist and were really not that long, but they were tight around my thighs?  And the crotch of the pants is in a weird spot.  I'd sat they are ""high waisted"" but pulling them up doesn't fix anything.<br />Love the pattern though.  I think I had a matching Trapper Keeper in 1986!!"
2.0,"It looks beautiful on this model, but it has to fit tight to look good, &#34;and&#34; what you cannot see in the photo is the &#34;bat wing&#34; on the arms!  Yes, there are bat wings on this guy!  The sleeves are &#34;connected&#34; like a flying squirrel suit or a batwoman suit.  My wife didn't like that and laughed when she tried it on.  (strike one on my first online purchase for clothes for her)"
2.0,Purchased for my daughter. They came in late and some were broke. But i was able to glue back on. Overall good buy but plan on low quality.
2.0,I did not get what I ordered they look very close to the ones I ordered but they're pretty.
2.0,"The watch case is fine but the band is very uncomfortable. The buckle digs into my wrist leaving a mark and I don’t wear the watch super snug. The band looked cute but I can’t wear it, too uncomfortable. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Too tight, smashes my nose,  too tight on my neck as well.  Edges are unfinished and will fray. Tiger stripes are not on the neck as the picture showed."
2.0,pants were very tight. Okay if you like that.
2.0,Doesn't really look like the pictur. Also I got a 3 pack of a different brand and it's basically the same for the same price.
2.0,"The material on this jacket was very thin and slippery.  The lights did not work, so I had to return it.  I returned it to Kohls (since they have a deal with Amazon) and received a 20% off coupon.  They had a similar jacket of much higher quality and I got 20% off.  Score!"
2.0,"Irregular size, poor quality."
2.0,"the shirt was great when I came I, but as soon as I washed it the sticker on the back of the shirt with the brand stuck together. When I tried to fix it the sticker started to peel off on the shirt was ruined."
2.0,"Love the material, however, I ordered a large and ended it up giving it to my daughter who wears a small. Other than the sleeves being a little long, it fits her great. I will reorder for myself and go up 2 sizes."
2.0,I liked it okay but it broke the first day I wore it.  Not good quality
2.0,"In the picture the shirt appears to be more of an a-line, but it is cut very straight, making it loose around the waist and maybe tighter around the hips. Lightweight polyester. I don’t think I’d recommend."
2.0,So for a big gal like myself these overalls look ridiculous. So I took matters into my own hands and changed them into pants.  Not bad since they were inexpensive and I can sew. 🤷‍♀️
2.0,"I wouldn't describe these as  black, but more of a dark blue. The lining is a light blue, and on the left leg, there is a patchy fuzziness already where you can see the lining color through the fabric, and I've only worn them once. So not really great quality, and not the color expected, either. The fit is fine though, and they are comfortable. I just don't think they will last long."
2.0,"These fit above the belly button like they are suppose to and they look nice. But this doesn't matter because they fit terribly. I ordered a XL and what I received feel like a medium. They fit but half way through the day, I had to take them off because they were so tight around my thigh area - digging into both sides. Order at least 1 size up. I find the sizing here very misleading. I won't torture myself by trying to wear these. Waste of money"
2.0,The quality was nice looking for the price. The gold didn't look fake or gaudy. I am rating it two stars because the ball would not unscrew from the top of this.  I was finally able to get it off with a friends help and a lot of muscle. But took me weeks to do so!
2.0,"Useful for me to have, but after 3 months of using it the clasp broke. I probably put the keys to the clasp a couple of times."
2.0,"This blouse is pretty, however, it is not pink but peach. Not the same color as photo! Disappointed, I needed pink! Also I ordered a medium and it is a bit large."
2.0,"I was so excited when I saw the vibrant colors for this dress.  I was equally disappointed when the dress arrived and the colors were dull.  Photo is very misleading.  Regarding size, I never take a XXL but reading the suggested fit I ordered that size and it fit perfect."
2.0,The material is very scratchy and the white shirt hem is very stiff.  It flares out at the bottom and is not very flattering.
2.0,"Mi bought this baggy looking dress thinking it would be really loose and something I could throw on to be comfortable as I recover from having a baby, but the fabric is so clingy and stretchy that it shows every curve. It’s also higher neckline than I wanted."
2.0,they were 2 different colors couldn't even wear them
2.0,"The shipping time was as described, and when it arrived I at first was very happy with it. However I have used the backpack twice (the first time carrying nothing more than a binder that I don’t even think weighed a full pound) and on this second time, the zipper completely separated while zipped up and then when I tried to unzip and fix, the zipper piece popped off from one side. Only thing inside was my laptop and charger, and a small bag of chips. Unfortunately I really regret this purchase. It probably would have been fine for really light-weight things but being advertised as a “college backpack” I honestly expected it to be able to hold a laptop."
2.0,The dress was cute but the large was too short and im 5’6. The xl fit weird.
2.0,"Look nice, but They shrunk on first wash and my husband cant wear them anymore. Don’t waste your money."
2.0,Poor quality breaks easily. Waste of money
2.0,This skirts fits tight.  It also ripped the first time it was worn.
2.0,I looked like a christmas ornament in this dress.....I going to just leave that there.
2.0,Its sooooooo huge!! The face is giant and heavy! The talking part is ok. Might be ok for big guy but not for older lady.
2.0,"I ordered an XL, I could not get the sleeves to go on correctly.  It fit ok throughout the body but the sleeves were all twisted up and super tight. I had to return it.  It was also short in length. I wanted to love it."
2.0,"the picture shows bracelet with hearts on it, but the hearts are missing."
2.0,Used it once to carry not alot of items to work and I noticed the strap was already breaking. Cheap material. I wanted to love it but I'm returning it.
2.0,"The Awen image is not as clear as in the photo;  it is in fact very dark and difficult to see unless it is viewed in bright light.  The surrounding setting is, however, fairly attractive.  Delivery time was slow - about three weeks.."
2.0,Washed once and the hem came unraveled
2.0,"I purchased the first one Spring of 2019 & it was organized & beautiful.  I received the second one in January of 2020, the coin zipper completely broke in two days and it was the first wallet I have ever owned that would not fit a small checkbook.  A complete waste of money. However, amazon was upstanding and reimbursed me for this wallet. Thank you!"
2.0,Ought up still didn’t fit. Pretty shirt but bigger women beware
2.0,Made out rubber but cute still will wear
2.0,Couple of them are on so tight I can't get the ball off.
2.0,I like the style but it’s too thin and long for the price .
2.0,"The basic design is nice, but it's far too large to be practical. With just a few credit cards, it becomes very fat, and the wallet is extremely wide. The card slots are pretty snug as well, making it hard to get cards in and out. The quality of construction is good, and it's nice material, but it's not really good for anyone who keeps their wallet in their front pocket."
2.0,The 3XL shirt that I wanted was sold out so I went for a 2XL which I failed to check
2.0,Not what I expected or thought I ordered.  Wish they were stiffer and would hold their shape.  Wasted my money!
2.0,"I was disappointed when I opened the box. The box is bigger than the earrings itself! The earrings are super tiny , they seem more fit for a toddler. They’re cute but just too small."
2.0,These tunnels are OK. They're soft rubber. They kind of hurt your ears. Maybe I'm just sensitive but I've had gauges for 15 years and never experienced this type of material. I'd rather go with hard acrylic but for the price it's just a throw away anyway.
2.0,Material was so thin you could see right through it! I had to return this item.
2.0,Really hard to unscrew the top and only wore it a week and the diamond fell out.
2.0,Runs small and is very short. Snags easy.
2.0,Product came dirty like it had been used before
2.0,"I’ve had it for two weeks. One drop on a tile floor and the plastic casing cracked and copper threads started coming out from the inside, breaking the coil and making it non-functional."
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed with the length of the leggings. I'm 5'7"" and these are like high waters on me. I guess they'll have to be pajama pants.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />If you would like to keep them soft on the inside, never ever, EVER wash them.<br />One wash and now they are itchy and rough!"
2.0,Fit ok but too long. Inseam reporter was not accurate. Washed and dried and now they don’t fit.<br />Waste of money
2.0,"Maybe I ordered it too large, even though that's my size but it wasn't flattering I felt like it was just ""hanging"" loose on me it was too blah..."
2.0,There are hooks in the crotch area is very  uncomfortable feel bad hard to walk is like you have a piece of metal down there i sent back
2.0,"Disappointed that there are no lower pockets, only the breast pocket, also not thrilled about the look of the denim, it has a worn look with gouges in the fabric"
2.0,Smaller than the average size
2.0,Style was cool...lenses sucked.
2.0,Pretty cheap looking. It’s basically a roach clip.
2.0,One part of description says two piece and then in another it says it’s a one piece. In fact it is a one piece. Mixed descriptions.
2.0,They are pretty but sadly some of them came broken 💔😭
2.0,"I got what I paid for. Too small, see through, and hella bacon-necky."
2.0,There is no way these things are insulated. We were in 20 degree weather and had to cut the day short because these boots were so uncomfortable.
2.0,"Product comes in smaller than advertised, wouldn't buy from again."
2.0,The watch design is very nice but its look is as inexpensive as it's cost! I have others by Geneva but this one is not as nice.
2.0,"These were on my wish-list so I received them as a gift. OK as sunglasses, the interchangeable lenses seem like a cool idea but I rarely found a time when I needed to swap them out. I have a second inexpensive pair of light-tint glasses that are a better option on bright but not sunny days.. After a few months the nose rubber detached itself and constantly needed to be re-glued. At 6 months I decided to exchange the lens and with only gentle pressure removing the old lens the frame simply broke in two!"
2.0,"It's a pretty nice jacket, fit my brother nicely and soft inside, but did not come with the detachable faux fur hood liner that was advertised for it, so we'll have to leave a low star rating for now."
2.0,"You'd think being one size fits all it would be very loose, all over, but it is not, while the upper portion is loose the hip portion is not.  The model must be tall because the side seams went well below my knees.  I had to remove stitches from the side seams to achieve the same 'look' as shown."
2.0,Gloves ran real small to tight for me
2.0,This runs very small in my opinion.
2.0,Just didn’t know I had to get someone to put them together. I didn’t read the comments. Will not do that again. And very nicely decorated and packed  in the container.
2.0,"The material color is nice, but does not have any stretch at all. They are very short and small, and fit my 12 year old niece."
2.0,"I bought this in white, the material is a little stiff and not flowy. I found it to be unflattering for a slim frame. Since it was not Prime, returning is not as easy and you have to pay return postage. I am thinking about trying to wash it to see if it will soften, and will update my review if it does."
2.0,Good qualité but sizing is Wayne of. I usually wear a médium tout large but roderez and XL to be safe. Il fits l'île à small and vert short.
2.0,Not  enough removable links to fit wrist. Had to improvise and modify clasp attachment to get a reasonable fit. Otherwise bracelet finish and quality is good. Certainly not made to fit a ladies wrist.
2.0,Necklace was small.
2.0,"Was excited to get this for my vacation, but disappointed in the quality. No support in the bra area, cups were loose and not sewn in - this part was baggy whereas the straps were really tight. If you don’t need the support this might work well for you, but I’ll be returning this product."
2.0,Bonito pero el corazon vino golpeado. No lo puedo regalar
2.0,"Super thin, not firm control in any way. I have regular cheap tank tops from Walmart that slim better."
2.0,Runs small. Tight around the waist.
2.0,"I am giving this two stars - not because it doesn't work. I wouldn't know. One of the bracelets arrived with a significant size chip out of one of the plates. Since there was no piece in the packaging, I have to assume it was packaged that way. One of the other bracelets broke (the cord) upon trying it on. Needless to say, this item appears to be of a lower quality than I was led to believe. I had thought I would return the set because of the chip and order it again, but I don't think I will now."
2.0,"The color and stitching on this is cute, but it runs small. I usually wear a medium in EVERYTHING, and this fit way too snug, it fit like a small. AND the zipper broke the second time I wore it. The zipper head came right off the track when I zipped it up all the way."
2.0,They were short and a size or two too small. Not to mention I ordered up a size. Maybe they are just meant for small people.
2.0,"Not even close to picture, really cheap looking elastic waist. Looks like a swim cover_up"
2.0,Crappy cheap material. And they don't send all your products. Don't recommend!!
2.0,This fell to pieces after a few months which told me the frame was rubbish .As for the lens they are just OK.
2.0,Not a fan! Do not like the waist band at all. It is way to small thickness wise! It cuts into my squishy stomach and makes things look weird🤦🏼‍♀️ Also they're very much see throuh!
2.0,"I like the jean a lot but it does not fir right. I have returned it two times trying to get the right size. I hope that it will finally fit me. If it does not, this time I will let go of ordering it the third time."
2.0,"Bought it for my Fitbit charge, good fit and it was working great the first new months. However the metal piece might be too heavy eventually overtime it broke my watch after months of usage ?<br /><br />You can either call it Fitbit too weak or metal band too heavy, either way end piece of my watch broke today. A risk to consider…."
2.0,"These are cute enough but huge (almost the size of adult slippers even though the inside measurement is correctly for kids).  There is so much extra plush around them and heavy sole that they’re as heavy as winter boots, not really made for little kid feet that like to scamper quickly around the house.  I doubt if they’re breathable given how dense and huge they are, but once I gave them to our daughter I didn’t have the heart to take them away to return."
2.0,This does not compress..just a regular polyester feel or something..overpriced for a regular undershirt😡😡..If you want a tight feel..this is not the shirt for you...
2.0,It bends out of shape very easily.
2.0,Cheap shoe. Heel turning over first day. Wouldn't buy again. Although shoe looks good.  Warm. Not good heel support.
2.0,"Ordered three of these but only 1/3 was actually the product shown. The other two were just normal copper cups and not tulips. Still works, but come on, guys."
2.0,This purse does not spread open at the top.  Very hard to get things in and out of it because of that.  Not even going to try to use it.  Pretty though.
2.0,"I returned this product.  Just with trying it on, I didn't like the feel of it around my one calf.  Also, it seemed like it would get too hot and uncomfortable for my summer vacation.  Maybe if it were a cold weather vacation, I may not have minded it too much, although it felt weird to have something around one calf and not the other."
2.0,Not satisfied ..very different from the one displayed
2.0,Washed on gentle and the entire seam came undone.<br /><br />Comfortable material but not worth it if you can’t even wear it.<br /><br />Top fits oversized and bottoms are fitted
2.0,They worked well and rolled very smoothly on my way to Japan. Unfortunately on the way back the smaller one cracked on me and the larger one had one wheel constantly get jammed which made my kilometer walk to the station and transfer a nightmare
2.0,I was expecting a deep blue t-shirt dress however the blue is on the lighter side. Fits snug but not uncomfortably.
2.0,"I bought these because of the good reviews everyone else was giving them.  But for me, the arch is too far back toward the heel and is uncomfortable."
2.0,Very uncomfortable on your feet and ridiculously hard to put on.
2.0,"As one would say you get what you pay for... They extend from one side only, the side cords are skimpy. they are just ok, for the price"
2.0,Decent choice of fabric but the mesh inserts do not stretch with the rest of the pants causing a strange fit around the seams of the mesh.  I had also purchased the matching sports bra (which is very nice) but no longer needed since I had to return the pants.
2.0,"Item arrived broken. You can tell the headband used is  VERY flimsy and low quality. This isn’t worth the price. It should be no more than 7 dollars. I’m getting a replacement so hopefully that one will be okay,"
2.0,I ordered the beige and yellow and are super see thru. I will be returning.
2.0,the top part of this doesnt fit right at all. The skirt part does. But its not made so as to be able to ware a bra and its for a larger person. Needs to be more supportive up top.
2.0,They were too big.
2.0,"These glasses came in and were super cute! They felt kind of cheap, but that's ok because I didn't pay much for them. But after only wearing them for two days, the nose piece broke off. :( I wish there was some kind of exchange or refund I could make because they were super cute."
2.0,The material is tight fitting especially around the arms. My size is usually large but 2 sizes higher would have been better.  It does not fit loose as on the model.
2.0,too tight in the sleeves and bust
2.0,"I liked the bathing suit and was really looking forward to wearing at the beach house vacation with my family. I tried it on when I received it and thought it looked good. It fit well and I felt comfortable with this on. My only concern was the chest area. It was a little loose and not very supportive, I am not small chested so I thought ordering the size that fit my body would be fine. Either way it was manageable. I wore it one day for less than an hour, I didn't even go into the ocean with it on. Within 15 min of laying on my towel the underwire went through and started that irritating stabbing/pinching feeling you get when the underwire of your bra pokes out. I literally was just laying down. I did not goof around in the suit or even turn over. I didn't even make it in the ocean with it on. I stayed down at the beach a little longer just because I had just gotten there. Needless to say it was thrown away before noon that day. I was really disappointed about the cheap making of it since it was such a cute suit. :("
2.0,"They are not good quality nor did they fit well. For this price, I would have expected more."
2.0,"It's a cute sweater, but I have only ever worn it around the house...it is not what is pictured on the photo. Photo is WAY cuter, but it is a cozy little thing to throw on while lounging around the house in yoga pants and a Cami...I didn't return it bc it's comfortable even though it's my what the photo shows. A very loose crochet-like material."
2.0,Pointless.... They turn once you put them on.
2.0,Its for teens. I love them but they are not in my size .
2.0,"Very simple backpack if that is what you want but it does look pretty cheap, better suited for a younger girl child or teen."
2.0,"SHORT BELT - ONLY 38&#34; LONG, BUT MUST BE ABOUT 55&#34;-60&#34;"
2.0,"First, when they arrived, they were a darker color than anticipated.  Blue is my favorite color, so that wasn't a huge deal.  They are cute and comfortable....HOWEVER....they have ZERO cush in the shoe.  Feels like you're walking on a hard surface, so by the end of the day my feet felt tired and achy.  Can't wear them two days in a row.  They are cute though....."
2.0,RETURNED AFTER ORDERING A BIGGER SIZE EVEN IT WAS TOO SMALL
2.0,Cap was small and looked a lot darker than the picture
2.0,"Received a gift card for Christmas and decided to give this a try. We ordered the 1 lb and 2 lb “Motherlode”. First of all if you are going to call it the motherlode there should be better than a 37.96 ROI.<br /><br />Another issue I have is I have never seen silver or platinum in the raw for so I am not sure exactly what to look for. A little literature would have been nice. I am sure that we found 3 pieces of silver but again I wish I knew for certain. Plus if there is supposed to be platinum, what am I looking for?"
2.0,The stitching is coming out after one time use.
2.0,"do not, but too late to send back"
2.0,Dont recommend.  It is ratty looking.  Not robust like picture and about 2 sizes too small.
2.0,For the price I figured it would have stitched lettering
2.0,It is not worth the price in my opinion. The necklace that came with it was broken as well.
2.0,Good look in the package but the medallions popped off on second ride. Clips hold ok but I had to rig the straps by tying them. Wish they came sewn on both sides.
2.0,"Most of the time when I order jewelry I receive an authentication of a crystal, gem or diamond.  As pretty as the item looks, I am not sure if it is really a crystal."
2.0,"First thing I noticed was a seam with missing/partial threads. There were bits of thread, lint  & hanging threads all over it.  Such a disappointment."
2.0,"As a heart patient, these are not very comfortable. They work really well for every day work but not for airplane travel.<br /><br />Would love to return but they are socks."
2.0,I was looking forward to some comfortable sweats to wear when I got home from work.  Then I get them and put them on.  They fit fine but was super upset when I see this huge hole in the leg. Ugh.  So Mad.
2.0,The slipper runs big and there’s no arch support!
2.0,The shoes are very poorly made.  They felt flimsy out of the box almost like they were made of cardboard. They are shiny and fun but of very poor quality. After 5-7 wears the soles are falling off. Great play dress shoe but not really made to wear out.
2.0,"It's already coming apart on the inside seams  just 90 days later.  Before this happened, I would have given it 5 stars because its beautiful and the leather is thick and luxurious.  It looks like a very expensive bag.  I've gotten many compliments, but I'm disappointed in the build quality on the inside.  The leather shell will probably last forever, but the (nylon?) inner liner, while it looks nice, wasn't stitched to the leather very well.  To give them the benefit of the doubt, it could have just been a defect on my bag.  Unfortunately, now its too late to return it."
2.0,I’m a 12-14 bottom and 10-12 top. I ordered an XXL based on the reviews. It fits but not like the picture. On the small side. Bummer. Wanted to love it.
2.0,These are really cute slipper but they runs extremely small and has no stretch. You have to literally force your toddlers foot in them. I wouldn’t recommend buying these at all.
2.0,"Strap instantly broke after receiving it<br />Maybe just a bad one delivered, who knows"
2.0,"The dress is exactly what it looks like in the picture, but it is made of a cheap, swimsuit-like material, almost like an exercise shirt, that feels and looks really weird on. For that reason, I will not ever wear it."
2.0,"This is not flattering at all. But since I dont care to be flattering at work, I will likely still wear it. For as long as it stays togehter. Seems like it will fall apart rather quickly."
2.0,"Ordered 2X-Pink Flower Print<br />I ordered two of these dresses, same size but different colors. I tried  both dresses. One fits as expected (gorgeous), but the other is a different size. Couldn't get the dress on at all. I normally wear between L/XL (14-16), went up in size after reading reviews. Dress must have been tagged incorrectly. I gave it 2 stars because it was such a pretty dress."
2.0,"I purchased the gold plated earring set with 3 hoops and 3 studs.  Great price and frankly with three holes in each ear, would have been great “filler” earrings.  I went to put on the gold heart crystal pair and it literally bent in half.  I gently tried to straighten it and it broke off.  I have a lot of these low cost sets but this by far is the worst ever.  I would highly recommend looking elsewhere.  Don’t let the .925 sterling silver stamp fool you….these are probably our nickel!"
2.0,"Tight, thin, short and overpriced. I usually wear a size 16/XL and found this to be a bit snug."
2.0,This shirt is made out of a stretchy blend of materials that are very fitted.  Ok if you like that kind of tshirt.  Not thrilled with it.
2.0,"I wore these glasses once and the leg broke off! They were really flmemsy, they were really cute that one day.... I would hav loved them if they were sturdier. Very disappointed"
2.0,I bought these mainly for the drawstring closure. It's fake. They're soft and will be nice for around the house but it's false advertisement
2.0,It's a little hard to walk in them because they are too wide and want to fall off my feet.
2.0,Pretty little ring but much smaller that I expected.
2.0,"It's a great option for PNW fall and spring - the right weight for shoulder season and the water repellent finish is much appreciated. Nice to have some unique colors and patterns, too. My low rating is for the fit (really boxy/oversized) and the too-thin fabric. It's spring a leak after only a dozen or so uses"
2.0,"Size chart was incorrect for me.  I am a 36C and weigh about 150.  I ordered the large.  It was far too big and I think a medium would have been fine.  Unlike the picture of the model, the dress was not fitted around the bust at all.  The embroidery was scratchy feeling too, though I think I could have dealt with that, but if you have senstive skin you probably would want to avoid altogether."
2.0,"I would have liked this dress way better if it was actually the color that was shown online. I ordered the wine red, so I was expecting it to be a burgundy tone, or more of a purplish red. However, when I opened the package the dress was bright blood red! Which is a color that I would never have chosen because I am a redhead and I have reddish undertones in my complexion; therefore, bright red is not particularly flattering on me. I wish I would have ordered a different color. I still wore it to church one Sunday. Mainly because I had gotten a new pair of super cute booties and I wanted to wear them with a dress. The dress was comfortable for the most part, but the top was too big and I had to keep pulling it up in order not to be indecent. I should have worn a tank top underneath it to avoid showing too much cleavage, especially at church. Luckily, I choose to wear an oversized cardigan over it. I felt like I look a bit sloppy due to the top being too big and due to the bright hue next to my skin tone. I am not a small chested woman either, so the top must have been disproportionate to the rest of the dress. Perhaps a size down would have been better."
2.0,"Size was fine, but it looked cheap. Which I know it wasn't a big purchase."
2.0,"I got this in Black. This bag is ugly and cheap looking. Just a little smaller than how it’s pictured. It can definitely fit your phone and small items. It has a plain look, not fashionable or eye catching. For this price, I guess you get what you pay for. Spend the extra money $10 and get a better looking bag."
2.0,So disappointed I ordered st. Beige<br />In  the photo it is 2 tone- that’s not what I got<br />It said elastic waist band and sleeves - that’s not what I got<br />The model must have been very skinny to make this look over sized because it fits very snug<br />Also it’s very wrinkled
2.0,Cheaply made and the photo shows a lot more fabric than really has on it. It's a see through dress. Not worth the money. I'm returning it.
2.0,Too small for a large and I usually wear a medium
2.0,A lot smaller than what I expected.
2.0,Too small. These run very mall
2.0,"5'6"" | 138 lbs | usually a US size 6<br /><br />I ordered as the size chart advised, and nope. They don't fit at all.<br /><br />The elastic waist is super tight, the length is much longer than ordered, and they are not the loose fit promised. They pulled along the hips , like they're made for women who don't curve at all.<br /><br />The fabric is thin, so not a winter weight."
2.0,Not what I expected. Will return
2.0,"Ordered a pair and like the shape, color and price very much.  However, one lens popped out was lost.  Amazon took it back.  I ordered two more pair, dropped a little Gorilla Glue between the lens and frames in both and plan to leave one in my car.  Hope that does the trick."
2.0,I know it was supposed to fit loose but it was completely oversized and had two small holes.
2.0,It was a good deal for three. But one of the rings came broken and wouldn't stay closed. Also I'm not sure if there was a mix up in the labels or something but I ordered 16g and they were definitely way too big for my piercing. Only redeeming factor here was that the company was extremely helpful in resolving the issues and were very prompt with communication.
2.0,"These glasses came up in my search for nighttime driving glasses and are definitely not for nighttime use. My mistake for not fully reading the description, which does not mention for nighttime use. These glasses are dark tinted with a yellow mirror outside coating. I will use them for the day as they are effective on cutting glare"
2.0,poor insoles. had to add my own. I can feel the inside of the heel
2.0,"The feel of the material was different than what I expected, and overall just not a good look or feel. 😕"
2.0,Top band rolls way too easily. Not comfortable at all.
2.0,"I dozed up quite a bit and the costume fits except around the bust, where it flattens."
2.0,I loved it at first but after just a few weeks the zippers all broke and the seems on the inside are ripping out already.  I am really disappointed.
2.0,Bought these shoes on a January 3rd and wear them roughly 5 days a week for work as a teacher. Outside of school hours I almost never wear regular shoes.<br /><br />It’s now June 13th and bottoms of the exterior of the shoe are coming apart.<br /><br />Honestly disappointed as I had done my research and was hoping to find something with longer term potential - I’ve had $20 clearance boat shoes from Kohls last longer
2.0,Too small for me. But I was able to give as a gift to a child
2.0,The jacket itself was nice on the outside but the cheetah print fleece fabric is definitely not as pictured. Pattern is VERY cheap looking. Will be returning.
2.0,"i spent $11 on this which is my mistake. listen to the reviews. i’m not surprised because i figured it would be horrible but i just want to leave this so people don’t buy this! it fell apart, it’s impossible to wear (so bulky), and the inner ring parts get jammed"
2.0,Cute but fell apart in matter of minutes.
2.0,zip broke after 1.5 months of use
2.0,"These socks are very thick and fluffy, and may not fit in your shoes. I don't find them particularly warm."
2.0,"I initially loved this set (I thought it was a jumper, it is not) I wore it on vacation. It didn't smell initially when I took it out of the bag, but after wearing it once it seemed to start smelling very very weird once it hit humid air (or something) it was overwhelming. It smelled kind of like seafood and metal. I had to place the pants in a separate plastic bag in my suitcase. It was that bad! I have now washed them 2 times with baking soda, unstoppables, detergent and they still stink. I guess I could have sent them back but it was probably over the timeframe. I like them they just smell horrific."
2.0,"Also, difficult to place pads properly; since adhesive prevents adjustment as needed."
2.0,These are super pretty but they also run super large. I usually wear 8 us and these are like one number up. I ordered again in 7. Don't think I can return as they come from China
2.0,It's the same shirt but not the same shirt...its not v neck.  Its slightly lower in the front but not low enough. It does not have ties in front. It's a vest. A basic vest with no tags. Like at all. No laundry instructions. No size or anything.  Returned
2.0,"It hangs like a rag, it must be from China"
2.0,"Looks great but runs small, I would purchase again but 2X is the largest I was able to find."
2.0,The tassel fell off the second day of using it.
2.0,"At least 1/2 a size smaller that as stated.  I wear a 9 in everything and only when they're shoes that I purposely want loose, like say to wear with super heavy socks, I might try a 9.5.  I'm wearing thin dress socks and the ones I ordered are size 9 and I can't even get them on my foot.  At least 1/2&#34; smaller in length than the other size 9 boots I already have on.  They look cute but I'm so disappointed I can't even see if they'd be comfy in a larger size as I can't even get them on my foot even with both buckles undone. :o("
2.0,It's starting to tarnish
2.0,verrrrry small
2.0,Came in with no bow and macarons are poorly put together
2.0,"These ""Bright Silver"" mirrored lenses appear great just as the surrounding neoprene seals comfortably.<br />The ""new & improved"" nose bridge however is too small and not adjustable, it hurts and bruises the sides of the nose.<br />The lenses are extremely dark and blurry underwater.  They did not fog on me.<br /><br />I missed the 30 day return window unfortunately as I waited for outdoor pools to pen for summer.  I started an email thread with their customer service.  I'll report back on their resolution if they are able to do anything."
2.0,I take an xl so I bought 3 xl couldn’t fit on my shoulders
2.0,"They are very pretty, no doubt.  However, none of them hold my glasses.  I even have inexpensive plastic glasses (no weight), and the metal piece on ALL OF THEM, always loosens up and my glasses fall off the chain.  And yes, I have tightened, and tightened, they simply don't hold."
2.0,"I bought these socks for my boyfriend who has horribly smelly feet. They did nothing to absorb odor, but more changed the odor. His feet still smell terrible so I ended up just purchasing him very expensive regular socks."
2.0,size fit like a 36 not 38. if your a 38 you will need a 40. So wasted my money on these. they dont fit
2.0,Hard to get it to work initially.
2.0,the fit was nothing like the model
2.0,It definitely does not look like the picture. No where near as dressy as i hoped. It's a typical summer dress.
2.0,They're very pretty but do not sit the way they're supposed to on your ears so I am not using them
2.0,"It is hard to find correct wording for this bra, because it is very pretty and the dollar amount seems good until I got it home.  This bra can give no support at all because it stretches everywhere, the straps, the back, even the cups.  If you can sit still while wearing it, it is fine but once you start moving and your body starts turning or bending and your breast are large DD and above, it is easy for one or both breasts to fall above or below the cups.  Had it on and went for a walk, lucky it was just getting dark and I was not too far from home.  The bra is still pretty and inexpensive enough that I am going to play with it and see if I can turn it into something useful."
2.0,Shirt has a small dot design that you can’t see in the picture and fees like swimwear.
2.0,"The straps are awkward, not a good fit. Thin fabric ."
2.0,"Worked great when purchased but now makes loud clicking sounds when watches are turning. Hard to sleep at night when all you hear is click, click , click, click! My Wolf still works great!"
2.0,Clasp hard to open
2.0,"It looks good but broke my wrist out with bumps.I have an allergy to nickel ,but emailed company  they said no nickel used .So I have a bracelet I can look at but not wear"
2.0,"Wasn't salmon colored but was a dark orange. The shells were such a dark purple that they looked black. Very disappointed that it didn't look like the picture. I definitely wasted spending an extra $20 to get it here before halloween, and I ended up only wearing it for a few minutes since I disliked it so much"
2.0,"These are NOT soft. They are tolerable at best. They are advertised as being ""thin, stretchy, and soft"" as if they will be really comfortable yet, they are scratchy and have a starchy feeling to them. They are not soft at all and the stretch is mediocre, not what I expected at all. This will be the last time I order socks online for sure. It seems anyone can advertise whatever they want that will get you to buy it and charge you for quality you don't receive, with no repercussions. Two stars are the most these deserve and I only gave them that because they fit, not for comfort or quality."
2.0,"They are okay, but I was looking specifically for earrings I can leave in all the time. I've been wearing them about a week now and the part on the hinge has already turned black. Not what I was expecting from sterling silver.."
2.0,We like the necklace but the chain broke within two weeks of us having it.
2.0,"Good size, but definitely not the color in the picture!  I guess it's not a terrible color, but I like the color in the ad better."
2.0,"This was really large , I needed 2 sizes smaller...I ordered an xl because they are noreally smaller than expected, I need a medium in this blouse.."
2.0,"Very pretty ring, but the corner stone fell out."
2.0,Nice but fits too lose for the size I got.
2.0,Hurt the bridge of my nose as soon a I put it on.  I thought it was redesigned to take care of this issue.  Can not use them.<br />Seem to be more off sliver/brown.
2.0,"Lucky I'm a seamstress because I had to make A LOT of alterations. I only did that because the fabric was so pretty and I really wanted to make it work. Other reviews said to order a couple sizes bigger. I am a medium, so I laughingly ordered an extra large thinking I would have some extra wrap room. But the bust is WAY TOO small...and I'm an A cup! I'm 5'7&#34; and it touched the floor without heels. It was just made all wrong."
2.0,I was hopeful.  Fit old plane for first leg of my trip.  Second belt did not work on new plane for second leg. Carried these across the country and then returned.  Boo.
2.0,The leg broke after a couple of days
2.0,I love the belt but they sent me the wrong size twice !
2.0,Just did not fit and look like model. I did not like the fabric.
2.0,It just a little too bulky and tight. It seems like it fit teens or younger better.
2.0,"I loved these earrings, but unfortunately they broke after wearing a dozen or so times.  So disappointed!"
2.0,The large is more like a medium
2.0,"Not bad I suppose for the price, but these are thin socks and I don't anticipate they will last long."
2.0,"While I received this in a timely fashion and it seems to be made okay, I'm giving this a low rating because it was advertised as 100% cotton when it's actually 100% acrylic. I would not have bought this had its fiber content been properly noted."
2.0,Pretty but came apart almost as soon as I started wearing it
2.0,"Sooo, I’m not sure what these are made from, but they are super cheap. I mean, they’re actually inexpensive, so that’s totally fine, but I think they may have “painted” them with a black sharpie. The paint came off on the first wear, and stuck to my fingers?  Not sure what’s happening there, but they are super cute."
2.0,I ordered my regular size and the length is fine. The width of the shoe is fine except for the toe area which wasn't sized for actual feet. I've tried to stretch it out to no avail. My toes are so squished they are painful to wear.  The bottom of the shoe has no traction so I'm slipping and sliding walking on my kitchen tiles. Shipping took 6 weeks from China.
2.0,I returned these. I thought they were ugly.  The colors were kind of garish and I didn't like the dots.
2.0,"These socks are thick and comfortable, but huge. They are soft and comfy fabric, and well made. However, I am easily a size 10, and these slipped off my heel constantly. They also were not completely hidden in the shoe. Finding socks like these that don't slide of the heel is such a challenge. I am still on the search."
2.0,One of the metallic buckle is damaged
2.0,I order this a size bigger and it was still too small.
2.0,"Its a great shirt but ive only worn in my car driving, and iwashed it once. Second time putting on and a feel a breeze on my lower left side. Theres a decent sized hole there, looks like poor stitching. Ive already worn so idont expect them to do anything. Its a really nice shirt but this is a serious letdown."
2.0,Came with front closure unsewn . I’ll repair it then wear it. Beautiful
2.0,"The print is adorable, and the shorts really aren't horrible. The top, however, is much too flimsy, which makes it look like I wrapped a piece of fabric around my boobs."
2.0,My necklace got wet once for 1 minute and ended up turning all rusty.
2.0,but that didn't work out so i used one in my hair and stuck with the other one. lol
2.0,Was able to use for a few months. Fell apart and is unusable now. Good looking enough.
2.0,Looks cheap and the gold isn’t smooth. Don’t recommend.
2.0,The green color is different from the picture. Its definitely not army green. Also the sleeves are shorter too.
2.0,Runs super small. I ordered 2 sizes up and it’s still super snug. Cute design. Too bad sizing is way off.
2.0,Fit extremely small
2.0,Didn't work out of the box.  Return for refund was smooth and easy.
2.0,"Came as described. Kinda strange that they came in a VERY large, padded envelope. I'm using the longer gold piece now as an extension for a necklace that was too short. I love that there's a Lobster Claw clasp instead of a Spring Ring clasp - makes it easier to put on and take off without looking. So far my neck hasn't turned green so that's a plus.<br /><br />Update 7/21/17: I was using the gold piece and it started changing color drastically after about a month of use. It's now a dark copper shade (it's dark like a dirty penny), has an acidic metal smell, and looks really unattractive. Spend a few extra bucks to get something that will last."
2.0,"I thought I was ordering a shirt similar to what I saw in a store, which was one of the awesome no-iron Dockers shirts. However, this shirt does indeed require ironing. Many people will not be put off by this, but just be aware before you buy it."
2.0,Very pretty but the elastic around the ears is too tight and not adjustable.  Very disappointing as I bought a pack of 5.  So disappointed as I wanted to wear these cause they're so pretty but it's not worth it.
2.0,the quality of the shoe seemed to be lacking - they fit well but i returned because i didnt think they would hold up for long
2.0,Brim is too long
2.0,"This cap is OK I guess. The RGB is not very bright, which is OK I suppose, so while it looks cool, not too distracting or out there. One issue I had though was, I fully charged it, no problem. Unplugged it from the charger, played with it a bit, then plugged it back in. I noticed the charger cable started to get hot. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?? I unplugged it and tried a few minutes later and it was fine.. then, next day I tried again and same thing, charge cord got hot, had to cut power to the charger. Man, I really hate to do this to you guys, this was gonna be a 4 or 5 star review, but that wire heating is not safe. Not sure if maybe I just got a bad one, but I can't in good conscious, recommend this product at this time. I think there are some safety issues that might need examined. I'm not sure."
2.0,The bag is quality leather and nicely made. Love the look. However I ordered the blue and it was not at all as pictured. In the picture the bag is a dark blue with silver hardware. I received a light turquoise bag with gold hardware. Amazon should really change the picture on the website. I returned the bag.
2.0,The design is pretty but it really hurts to lay on. It made my ears swell and I cannot even use the bar at all any more. Disappointed.
2.0,It is thin and falls right off my face. I will need to sew elastic in the top to get it to stay on.
2.0,"One wash or one dip in water and fabric will be kaput. A tan ONLY bikini~no activities will be done in this one! Kept it bc it's kindaaa cute, bottoms are skimpy af. Typical cheap bikini *shrugs*"
2.0,Material was very nice but it lacked shape even with the tie at the waist. Additionally it was too short for a professional setting.
2.0,This dress is very thin and see through.
2.0,"Very thin material, Idk if I like it or not."
2.0,Didn't like the akward flaps in front. Does not flow in front as pic shows at all. Very cheaply made and shows
2.0,Longer than what is pictured
2.0,Only will fit good for girls with small tummy’s (not a big pooch) and a little bit smaller thighs. My thighs are too thick for this but my upper tummy is too small but lower tummy is tight?
2.0,It’s ok the material isn’t what I was expecting & it’s smaller than typical.
2.0,It fits great and looks cute but the seams split when I tried it on. Glad it happened then and not when I was out and about. Debating exchanging it or just fixing it myself.
2.0,The graphic on the shirt appears to be made from cheap vinyl and is thick and stiff. This shirt is not high quality at all.
2.0,I expected the shield to be firmer as the photo of the product seems to portrait.  The shield is flimsy and undulated. A bit more rigid that a translucent shower curtain.  Very disappointed.
2.0,I bought this outfit for a baby shower and when it arrived there were random threads everywhere!  I had to go through the whole thing and cut about 10 pieces of thread off it.  I've never had this happen before.  The fabric was not soft at all.  I really didn't want to give it as a gift.
2.0,"Comfortable enough, but both had souls separating 6 weeks later. I used them daily but normally."
2.0,I liked the styling but not the fabric...stiff and relatively heavy fabric.
2.0,"Runs very small from the waist thru the fit of the legs (1-2 sizes).  Material pretty thin.  Even as an Amazon Prime member I was charged shipping.  And now, with the return, I will have to pay shipping again.  This info is carefully hidden."
2.0,"The first impression on this product was good, but after using it for a couple of times it started falling apart and we missed the timeframe to return it- so considering the price and duration of the product the quality is below the acceptable level. Would not recommend it!"
2.0,Not as pictured. Was green with brown stars. Didn't even bother trying on. It is going back.
2.0,Shows a nicer chain in the picture. Came with a horrible one. I would not have purchased if I known it came with a chain it came with.
2.0,Love glasses but the frame is very flimsy and very breakable
2.0,"Very comfortable and breathable, but it is definitely not as high waisted as it claims. It cuts into the “female area” if you pull it up too high. It also SHEDS LIKE A BEAST. It turned my hands and sofa black like an ink had been on them, even after washing the leggings, it still does it. Not as dark, but still noticeable. I wanted to love them. But I don’t. :("
2.0,Shirt was very awkward. I like other shirts from Allegra but this one was weird. Big on some parts even though I ordered my typical Allegra size.
2.0,I din't have the sparkle I was looking for!
2.0,Really really thin t-shirt fabric. no shape to it. Doesn't lay nice on baby.
2.0,It was see threw material so I returned it.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this set. The material is so soft. I thought that it would be great for around the house, but also looked sophisticated enough to wear out running about town.<br />The pants fit nicely and were quite comfortable. That’s where it ends. The top, while quite soft, was terribly uncomfortable around the neckline. The knit was done too tightly, and was far too constricting.<br />Because this set is supposed to be a total outfit, I can’t really recommend it due to the top not being constructed all that well."
2.0,U guys gave me the wrong size....thats disappointing...so i reorder it again...hopefully this time i get the right size....dnt c r get any text that i receive the money bk
2.0,"The product is much smaller than it appears in the picture. I intended to wear this as a hip scarf or around my shoulders, but it is impossible. If you want to wear this around your neck, it will work well, otherwise, try to find a different product."
2.0,"The watch band is small, not a good fit for big guys."
2.0,The bottom portion broke off when I was trying to attach a retractable babe reel. The flag looks ok on its own so I kept it but useless for its intended purpose
2.0,"Not really happy with this pendant. I understand there by are variations in Jade color, but this is not ""White"" at all. Really Clear.  Other than that it's pretty, but I am disappointed."
2.0,"Nice bracelets, nice quotes. But they did not come in full set. Random assortment. Why would I want 3 of one kind and 0 of others... Especially since these were NOT cheap for what they are. These were the favorite I found, but I don't want if it's not complete set. The quotes were why I wanted them and you can see from the pic what I received. I expected at least one of each. I'll be returning. Disappointed."
2.0,the &#34;antiquing&#34; was worn and badly done. Mine also had deep scratches in the side. I received a refund from the seller.
2.0,"This hat is very pretty, however it is very small."
2.0,"Not warm, but at least your hands are covered.  On the small side."
2.0,I love the wallet. I just hate how the magnets are so weak . They should really put stronger magnets and the wallet would be perfect
2.0,"Verdusa Woman's Casual V neck dress is very thin and flimsy.  The dress also arrived with a hole in one of the products. If the material were a little thicker and didn't have a hole, I would have kept the dress."
2.0,"It isvthevsize I wear but it doesn't fit, eaybto small"
2.0,"Okay here's the thing, it looks really pretty, but it breaks really easily. It's really pretty but the chain broke right away and I was disappointed. It's not really great anyways"
2.0,"This is a beautiful dress and can really be dressed up or down by adding a belt and heels. But the dress is NOT for full busted ladies, because the folding part on the chest will not stay down at all. I'm keeping it and taking it in to a seamstress to see if a pretty color band can be sown over the white elastic part that shows. It will look just as beautiful worn with the top not folded over if I can get this done, if not, oh well."
2.0,I found the sleeves to be too short and the chest area to be too large
2.0,"Bandana is super thin,"
2.0,Not low rise at all. Very very stretchy almost like a jegging
2.0,"Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. The top was so thin, I didn't have a bra that wouldn't show and the skirt was made from very stiff, very cheap-feeling material. Maybe if I were younger it would've been okay, but not in my twenties."
2.0,"The shirt is adorable but I like my shirts long and flowy. This was too short and tight for my liking. Very disappointed,  I really wanted to keep it for vacation."
2.0,It ripped within hours of wearing
2.0,"After buying these slippers, I had worn them 4 or 5 times before one of the toe dividers broke.  I also couldn't wear them for very long because they would start hurting my toes, which is why I bought them in the first place.  They were not very therapeutic. I bought them in a size L/XL which was way to big for my size 8 1/2 foot.  I bought them this size because I worried that the next size down would be too small.  I will not buy these again."
2.0,it was the same size as the zip ID case and i thought it would be a little larger.
2.0,It doesn't actually glow unless u have time to charge it under a black light and even then it barely glows in the daylight
2.0,"Several pairs had holes in them upon arrival.  Thanks, but I wish to wear them to the point where holes appear."
2.0,Haven’t to small
2.0,I ordered this in a size larger and it was still too small and much shorter than what the picture demonstrates.
2.0,Good quality just way to small for an adult.
2.0,This lanyard is nice but the string can’t come off on one side. Look very closely a photo and you will see the gap where the string.
2.0,It looked cheap to me. I returned it.
2.0,"I love the color of this top, it's a beautiful deep purple, not at all faded or washed out. Unfortunately, the fit wasn't very good. The sleeves were just a hair too short, and the fabric bunched up around the collar/armpit area. The double hood is strange as the two fabrics don't always stay together, and while the little buttons are a cute touch, they sit too high up for me, making the neck uncomfortable. Overall, I'd say pass on this."
2.0,"The fit, the color & shape of the dress are very nice but definitely NOT worth $15 considering it's made out of PIJAMA/SOFT T-SHIRT MATERIAL. I only wear this dress to run errands or go to sleep. NOT for a night out! This is an $8 dress at best and I wouldn't suggest u pay anymore then that for this."
2.0,These are no better than the original. Very brittle and one broke when I was changing the battery.
2.0,Not really the same in real life. The colors are but the cut is kinda weird.
2.0,"I loved this cap during COVID because I was able to cover my hair when going grocery shopping and not have to worry about washing my hair every time I went out. Great color. Works well with any outfit. I purchased two within a month.  After multiple washing, this item has fallen in favor. The band no longer has a shape. Meaning, it doesn't hold to my face...instead it hangs over the hair with open spaces around the edges where it used to wrap around the face (as in the picture). I will try to take a picture to show. It is unfortunate. If you want to use for less than a year (say 6 months), it is a good purchase. After that, it falls apart."
2.0,Cheap materials and construction. Claims stake is made of wood but feels like hollow plastic. Box is particle board and poorly put together. Had I known I would have passed on the purchase.
2.0,"support less than desirable on the top. colors as pictured. Felt the sizes ran a little large. I’m a 36DDD, and typically would wear a large top. this would have done better in a medium. fabric however was good quality"
2.0,"I bought these as a replacement for another pair of Isotoners I have that are finally falling apart after 10 years. The old pair was a nice spandex with actual leather grips (said leather is now peeling and cracking). It worked well for my winter/cold weather dog walking needs. I figured another similar pair would be just fine. Well, Nope. They've changed their design so instead of the nice smooth, stretchy spandex (like yoga pants), it's a rougher texture and just a little bit stretchy. Okay fine. I can deal with that since I really needed just a pair of lightweight gloves for cool morning walks so my hands don't freeze off holding the flexi-leash. What I really DO NOT like is the old leather grip has been replaced with something akin to rubber (or a plastic-y rubber-like material). It most certainly does NOT grip the leash at all. I now find myself holding onto it with a vise-like grip of death which makes my hand cramp. I'm sure this new material was far more ""cost-effective"" for Isotoner than using half-way decent leather, but it's s***ty. Rubber, when cold, has none of the traction it's otherwise known for as I've experienced first-hand thanks the my city adding rubber pavers to the crosswalks, which become a virtual ""slip&slide"" when it snows. I'm glad these are not driving gloves because I would have no control of the wheel as it would slide right through my hands. They are ""sort of"" warm-ish, but I would never use them for Cleveland winter walks in single digit temps (I have another pair of Columbia fleece gloves for that). These work for the 40-50 degree weather and not much below. Purchase with caution."
2.0,Very hard. More for kids to play with
2.0,"It is very comfortable and stretchy and fit as I expected, but the problem came upon washing it. It unraveled at the seams and the fabric has a fuzzy, worn down look to it. Almost as if the fabric is balling up. If you plan to just wear this around the house, no big deal, but I wouldn't say this is worth it for the price."
2.0,"the frames are cute but one of the lenses was scratched, really bummed about that."
2.0,"The moon and chain are made of very cheap metal, might even be plastic. Chain is fragile. Galaxy gem is just a bad photo print of a galaxy with a piece of plastic on top"
2.0,it should stay in place a little better and it's too wide for a standard shoulder sling to stay put and not twist around. i finally just took it off and threw it in a drawer with the rest of my useless gear and accessories.
2.0,"After reading some of the reviews I thought I would try my luck at these to make personalized Christmas gift tags from them.  Unfortunately, I also found most of them are BADLY scratched right from the bag.  They are easy to use, open easily, and snap together nicely. The photo size I used was 25mm wide by 39mm tall.  I can fit two photos back to back in each one and they work out very nice except for the severe scratching which makes them look awful.  Unfortunately I would not recommend them because of the scratching, otherwise, they are very nice."
2.0,I only received 3 witch hats when the listing was for 6 witch hats.  I paid extra for shipping to receive these before Halloween due to the fact they were decorations for my home.
2.0,Broke after the third wear
2.0,"the size was not quite right, im a L and ive bought other L amazon and my breast look beyond tight and suffocated not really the right sizing but good material and exactly the colors"
2.0,I liked three came in a pack.
2.0,"Arrived with a broken chain. Fixed the chain and it broke again the next day. Very cheap material, which makes it basically useless since you can’t wear it. The state charm is very nice but can’t wear with a broken chain."
2.0,"This is an OK product, one of them are ready broke… Wouldn’t buy again"
2.0,"I've no idea why this product is claiming everywhere that it runs too small and to order a size up. I didn't size up, ordered the ""Small (fits like XS)"" and it was still way too big on me. I am 5'4 and it was too long, inches dragging on the floor. While slender, I am also curvy (32D) but this had way too much extra fabric bunching and spilling over the cinched waist-line. I imagine it would be even worse for someone without curves.<br /><br />So this dress could maybe work if you ignore the seller's ludicrous advice to size up, are tall, and aren't slender/can fill it out.<br /><br />Outside of sizing, I can also report that the navy color is extremely dark/almost black and that there is no obvious front or back (no labels or tags except on a side seem) so you could probably wear this with the slit on either side. Reasonably thick fabric and felt breezy and comfortable."
2.0,"This is my second necklace from this company but this time the necklace was broken when I opened it up. It looked like it was tightly packed into a small little box, not sure if that is why it had broken.  The first one I had bought I was very happy with it but so disappointed this time, The necklace is nice though and love the color combination so still giving it a 2 star. A customer should not have to receive a necklace broken."
2.0,If you have big boobs. This top is NOT for you. It basically drapes over my boobs like a glittery circus tent and made me feel bigger then I already feel. It's cute for the little lumps out there though.
2.0,The fabric looks super cheap and it's larger than expected.
2.0,Even when expanded to max adjustment it is too small.
2.0,These would work better in the nose they are pretty big for ears!
2.0,"It's a beautiful hoodie the size was way off tho, I ordered a M and it fit like a x small I can't wear it,"
2.0,The picture is not clear.
2.0,Shirt was not at all fitted and material was sheer. Color and pattern are pretty but I purchased it to wear for fall pictures and I would've been freezing.
2.0,The shirt came so wrinkled it took me a minute to figure out what it was. I have yet to iron it.
2.0,"I’m only giving these a 2 because I ordered them in a size small, the khaki pair arrived first and they were about 12” too long and super huge! I’m 5’3” and these would have fit my 6’4” boyfriend. The grey pair arrived weeks later (yesterday)  and if I can get them to shrink a tad bit in the laundry, they should be fantastic. I can only assume the khaki pair were mislabeled and I was sent an XL."
2.0,"I like the style. The size runs big! I ordered the small, gray striped robe and it was 21"" armpit to armpit. I'm 5' 2"" and it goes to my ankles. The zipper is small and not easy to start. One reviewer stated that the fabric isn't good quality and that is true, because it isn't soft; it feels scratchy on your skin. The fabric care label reads ""Do not tumble dry.""  I thought washing would soften it, but it didn't. The fabric is 80% poly, 15% cotton, and 5% spandex. It came China post and I had to stand in line at the post office 20 minutes to sign for it.<br />So on  1/4/2019, I noticed the scratchy material comments about this robe have been removed from the original offering and put into totally different made up offerings, with different names! I bought this as a robe for $20. 00. I didn't buy the item being shown here. This disturbs me!"
2.0,Very cheap looking and poorly made don't waste your money!
2.0,"These sunglasses were quite nice after they arrived. Both the packaging and the glasses appeared to be of high quality. Though, the metal accent piece on the front of the glasses quickly fell off after just a handful of times wearing them. I wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,Sizing was not accurate.  The colors on the shorts were just as shown....but it didn't even come close to fitting my husband.
2.0,"Looked good for about a week. Small hole after first wash, unbearable after second. Graphic isn't as good as it looks on shirt"
2.0,Its a pack of three n all have different measurements with same size tag.
2.0,"I love the quality of the t-shirt, the fit and the design on the front. But I washed it once before wearing and the vinyl all cracked. I will still wear is as planned on vacation, but I don't expect it to hold up long at all."
2.0,"Minute hand swinging freely - didn't work.  On the plus side, it was easy to return."
2.0,"Too big. Style is slightly different than pictured, so kinda surprised when I opened the package and tried them on<br />I ordered a size down from my normal size and they are easily 2 sizes too big"
2.0,Both ripped within first wear
2.0,Shrunk significantly after one wash. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"Nice products,came on time.easy to wear,n comfortable."
2.0,For the price these are not great.  Easily a 20 dollar pair of sunglasses.  Pretty sure they will break soon if I don’t send them back.
2.0,They broke wants they were dropped
2.0,Didn’t like the color I ordered gold but got a tarnished color. Was very disappointed.
2.0,"Pretty dress but way to big. When you lift your arm you can see your bra through the arm hole, definitely need a cami or tank under it."
2.0,The pants are weird. You can't tell which side is the front. The top is fine.
2.0,The material was thin and the top much lower than depicted.
2.0,"Bought large to extra large size.  Initially fits well. However, within an hour my big toe nails were aching.  Made sure nails were trimmed and tried again.  Same result.  Apparently the foot section is too small.  Next size up would seem to be too large"
2.0,Trae un simbolo que imagino que es la marca y no me gusto. En la imagen no se ve que trae esa
2.0,Everything about this hoodie is cheap. I guess that’s what you get for 20 dollars.
2.0,Very stiff and uncomfortable. I figure it'll soften eventually but haven't been motivated enough to push through the discomfort.
2.0,I ordered a size larger like other reviews suggested and it’s still too small
2.0,"I had high hopes and it was a beautiful set for me and my husband, and it even got here pretty quick.<br />but it’s not stainless steel. Within a week both our necks were green and the necklace tangled very easily. I’m a bit disappointed. Please change the description.<br />It’s False advertisement."
2.0,"I like the dress.<br />-not in love with it.<br />-fits as expected.<br />-material not great, seems a little on the cheaper side. Most likely will give it away."
2.0,"These are super cute, but I ordered a women's XL and what I got could be XL for a child.  No way these are women's XL (even though that's what the label says).  So back they go (and I have to pay for return shipping).  Seriously bummed!  :("
2.0,"I loved the style with the zipper on the bodice. I also really liked the teal color. However, I found the fabric to be too scratchy (polyester - some polyester is soft, but this was more like a chiffon or true polyester) and it fit smaller than I anticipated. I had to return it. If the fabric had been different, I maybe would have ordered a larger size."
2.0,Does not fit well.<br />Smaller than I would have liked.
2.0,"This is more of an overskirt.  The front portion is made from tulle and is unevenly distributed across the front.  Not anything like pictured. You can not wear this without showing everything God gave you. The back is very cute, but plan on wearing leggings or a skirt under it."
2.0,I received broken zippers. Also I ordered M but it was too small as XS. Also I can't see any size and brand name tag. Can't know what size of this cloth.
2.0,These glasses are very functional for kids and the attached strap makes it very easy for them to stay on during all kid activities throughout the day. They are however small for the description. I recommend always buying one size larger than what you Need
2.0,"I little on the heavy side and tend to hang down a better back might helo ,they sure are pretty"
2.0,"Very cute, super sad it did not fit. I am 5,5” 180 I normally wear and XL. I order an XL and my boobs didn’t fit. I am a 38 C so not huge, alas they did not fit. Even with a sports bra it was too small. Very cute though!"
2.0,The Color is very different then it shows and the material is not soft as expected
2.0,"I thought I would have more of a use for this then I actually did. The novelty wore off fast & unfortunately, the order it emits did not. Months later and this thing still smells toxic impart to the materials used."
2.0,"Fit small, size up."
2.0,"This ring is very pretty, however, for $30, you'd think the band wouldn't be PAPER THIN silver.  This ring isn't sturdy.  As an avid jewelry enthusiast and collector, I can tell this piece will break with wear.  The aesthetics of the ring are gorgeous, but it is definitely disappointing to have such a thin, thin, thin band.  :("
2.0,"The adjustment clasps at the bottom of the stirrup have sharp pins that jab you in the shin. I wouldn't recommend these as the way the loop and clasp are designed, the adjustment clasp is turned so that the sharp end is pointing towards your leg, not to the sides. I recommend the Shirt Stays that either attach to your sock, thigh, or are like this but without the clasp."
2.0,"I received this today. I got the green color become I felt like I need more green in my wardrobe. Unfortunately this size is too small, I order a 3x, they sent a 2x. I didn't realize when I ordered it that it was Chinese sizes, which definitely won't fit me. It's OK though, I'll give it to my daughter. The color is actually quite nice and the material is light and breathable. I like the design of the open shoulder sleeves. I also like the pixie style corners that fall lover on the ends. However, there were quite a few places that had little threads coming out from the seem areas. This is not attractive and I will definitely have to snip them before I give it to my daughter. I'm pretty sure she will list his shirt, I just hope she likes the color. Overall the shirt is OK, with a little work it should be nice.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. I review all products that I order honestly regardless of discount. Everything stated here are my own opinions and my own experiences with using the product."
2.0,Too small I am a hundred forty five pounds an breast didn't got either
2.0,They are flimsy and look cheap. Probably going back
2.0,"Beautiful, lined, and seemed well made but the front was extremely short. I tried it on with high-waisted pants and it ~just~ met the hem but I was flashing skin with any movement at all. It stopped just above my navel. Other than the length it was a good fit so I had the right size. I'll have to return it but if you have a very short torso it might work for you."
2.0,"First pair I bought the left arm broke off the frame within a month, exchanged for another pair and had to immediately exchange those because the right lens was very loose and the focus did not seem correct. Received my third pair and, after 2 months, the left arm broke off the frame as well. Even if I could exchange them now, I wouldn't, it's just time to move on. Found a set of 4, really good quality, at Sam's for a few dollars more than this single pair."
2.0,They are to heavy and fall off really easy
2.0,"This runs very small, especially the jacket."
2.0,"The small was enormous on me. 5’2” ~120-125lbs. The fabric looked really really cheap in person for some reason- the colors used just did not work unfortunately. Was hoping for a multi-colored cute top, but sadly this is not the solution for me."
2.0,Very cute piece but cheaply made you can see glue along the edges.  The necklace broke after I wore it twice.  But it was cheap to begin with.
2.0,"This dress is super cute but be careful when ordering. If you have a larger chest size up. I personally didn’t think this dress looked good on me, that isn’t necessarily the dresses fault but it’s not gonna look good on everyone. I ended up not keeping this item."
2.0,"Weird fit, only for people with smooth skin everywhere....."
2.0,"While the style is cute the fit is unacceptable for my hourglass figure. I bought two sizes up from my normal size. The armholes gape a little due to the stretching for the bust. The fabric is not deeply printed and so wherever it stretches it looks lighter, revealing the white base of the fabric. This would have looked better on me in my hard body figure I had until recently as I was very tiny and had not one bulge. However, even then, I would have returned it because it looks so cheap with the way the black part looks gray wherever it stretches. My figure is too much of an hourglass for this. If you have broader shoulders and no extreme differences between your bust/hips and your waist so you can buy a larger size that doesn't need to stretch much, it might be okay for you. In a cut that was for a more hourglass figure and with a better quality deeply printed fabric, this would be lovely. This is a cheap dress that may work for some but that is not going to skim over any bulges or look upscale no matter what you do."
2.0,This is not true to size
2.0,Strangles your toes.
2.0,Jacket arrived used. There was crud and dirt on the sleeves and around the collar. It was also just thrown in the box with some paper. Was not impressed. Sent it back.
2.0,They ride down and have a strange wasteband. Fabric is nice though.
2.0,Straps twist easily.  I'll be returning it.
2.0,This is not what i expected.  Did not know it was possible to make denim this thin!  Sleeves are really short.
2.0,"The torso is very short , not flattering"
2.0,"I ordered 2 for my daughter & a friend. They are too big for my 10 year old's wrist at the smallest setting & no way to adjust.  We hooked it to one of the bracelet bands & it's working fine sizing wise.  Good solid product.<br /><br />Update:  After 2 months one of the bands came loose from the connection, no way to fix it."
2.0,"I ordered &#34;burgundy&#34;, but they are grape-soda-purple. They do seem to be well-made, and I like the feel of the fabric, but I didn't even try them on, as I know I will be returning them immediately. Not the color they looked in the photo, and they don't go with any of my tops. I'm really disappointed, because I ordered them to replace a favorite pair of Gloria Vanderbilt corduroy jeans that I wore until they eventually fell apart. Those were also called &#34;burgundy&#34;, but they were the right color."
2.0,"Though the color and glitter are great, there is absolutely no slip grip and it's not very stretchy, making it hard to get on and it slips right out a few minutes later. I am going to try and add a slip grip but I guess for the money you get what you pay for..."
2.0,not close to the size its suppose to be. way to small
2.0,I wear mine all the time and have gone thru 3 in just a few months. They keep breaking.
2.0,I’d recommend sizing up. It’s cute but a little sheer. I liked it for the pool but not much more.
2.0,Material is Very Thin! When you put it one it becomes discolored and streaks. Posting picture. Don’t waste your money.
2.0,I returned. Design was fine albeit fabric seemed inexpensive. Perhaps better w lining
2.0,This garment would be great except it doesn't stay put! It rolls down 👎🏽😏
2.0,[[VIDEOID:b033bc2e1c574a0c532d60e3391171e0]] This shirt actually runs very big so I normally wear a medium and size but this came as an extra large and unfortunately it does not fit well on me nor does it look flattering on me. I suggest wearing this blouse with a belt because it runs big.
2.0,"While the shirt is cute, I ordered a size larger than I normally wear so it would be loose fitting. I could barely get it on, so I returned it."
2.0,"When I first received this watch (6-7 months ago), I loved it. It kept time well, the date indicator switched consistently at midnight every night, and it was a classy watch that was big enough for me to use when I teach.<br /><br />Unfortunately, about two weeks ago, I started noticing that the time was off when I woke up. Even if I reset it that morning, it would be off by at least a half hour in the afternoon. Over the week, I realized the minute arm would ""get stuck"" at random points in the day. Over a few hours, it could stick and unstick itself a couple of times!<br /><br />As much as I loved the design of the watch (I still do), the inability for it to keep proper time makes it functionally useless."
2.0,"I bought these to wear while walking the dogs in the cold months. They're definitely warm, but they run short. I'm 5'7"" and I purchased a small. The material isn't very forgiving and the pants just seemed oddly short."
2.0,Returned item. Felt very cheap and not at all what I thought it would look like.
2.0,Bought for my son's soccer games. Just got home from a rainy game and my legs are soaked and they were under a blanket. Not water repellent at all. It does keep out the wind though.
2.0,"Bought it for a cosplay awhile ago when I was intrested in the dsmp and personally, I wouldn't recommend it. The mask was huge and hard to breathe through."
2.0,"Brim not as big pictured, and not shaped as well but mold as you wear it. Crocheted, a bit small. Would not waste money on it, live and learn! 2 stars is generous"
2.0,"returned, beads roll around to much and hard to fasten."
2.0,"This cape is nice and big and will cover the top half of most people, which is great. It's material will keep the hair debris and hair products off of your body, but don't expect to come out of a hair washing completely dry. Unfortunately, this was my main purpose of purchasing this cape. I soaked my hair and rinsed it out, and I was left with a wet t-shirt underneath. I ended up returning this because of it. It's a shame because I do this the pattern is neat."
2.0,"I read in the reviews that I needed to order a much larger size, so I ordered 2 sizes up.  When I got the products, it fits in the shoulders and the hips, but it isn't form fitting in between and I guess that is what I expected.  It fits me very loosely.  Not sure even getting a smaller size will help and then there's a possibility that my shoulders will be too tight."
2.0,Too small and skimpy despite ordering a size large hoping for a loose fit. Inconvenient that it has to be sent back.
2.0,Doesn’t look much like the picture. Disappointed in this purchase.
2.0,"This watch for great & came super fast, but after wearing it for 2 months the band just fell apart."
2.0,"Used one if the hanger three times and while at a restaurant last weekend the swivel part that is connected to the larger disk snapped allowing my purse to fall. Other two are okay for now but worried the they will have the same issues. Kindle was in my purse at the time, but luckily the case it is in protected it during the impact."
2.0,I was disappointed in the fit!  I wear 1x-2x and in this shirt I would need a 3x-4x to have fit properly!
2.0,save your money...
2.0,It's a cute coat but the sleeves are too short and the hood is small as well.  I'll be lucky if it fits my child through the winter.
2.0,I'm 5.3 and these pants were really long for me and somewhat weird fit. But they are so soft.
2.0,"Love these glasses, but the bifocals are SO low on the glasses, your eyes are literally near-closed by the time you see reader portion. I literally have to raise the glasses with my finger to use the reader portion. Too bad, because the seller is AMAZING and very helpful. For that reason, I kept them."
2.0,"Nice looking glasses, but poorly/cheaply made. One arm of the glasses broke in half after less than one month of wear. I guess it true what they say, you get what you pay for."
2.0,Feels more like thin vinyl that fake leather. Zippers don't zip smoothly.  Not impressed for the $$ but not worth the effort of sending back.
2.0,Made  for boys not men
2.0,"Definitely does not hold up, just list the second stone. First stone fell out within 24 hours. I do not wear daily, only if myvhands are swollen, this a good ring for a one time wear, or at most fir a short term need"
2.0,"I have been searching for a simple, affordable pair of reading glasses that will not give me a headache, will not blur on the periphery of vision, and that will clean up easily without scratching.  Unfortunately, this pair fails on all 3 fronts for me.  Stylistically, they are nice looking specs, but what good is that if they don't deliver where it counts.  I suspect that the lenses are very cheap quality.  Dissapointed."
2.0,I don’t have large wrists but this watch band was too short to comfortably wear. And in my opinion the procedure to set the watch time is more complicated than on other digital watches I’ve had. I was not expecting a lot for this price but I’m disappointed
2.0,Bigger than I thought they would be. sent them back.:(
2.0,"I really wanted this to work, so tried it despite the reviews that said: &#34;Top is too large; bottoms too small.&#34; That was exactly my experience. I was swimming in the top (I'm a 36C), while I could barely squeeze into the bottoms (I'm a 10-12). I ordered a large. Had to return it."
2.0,"My 10 year old isn't especially active, but these still fell apart after about a month. Specifically the rubber around the toe came off. We tried gluing it but it won't stay put so now he looks like he is wearing 2nd hand sneakers. These cost way too much to fall apart so quickly.<br /><br />They are very good looking, fit well and I love that the bottom doesn't wear away quickly."
2.0,Does not look like the pictures… looks cheap or something you would buy at party/costume store.
2.0,Came apart at the seams around the stomach. So I was only able to wear it like once or twice. My sister may have stretched it out though.
2.0,"If I had known the stitches would be so itchy, I would have never bought it. Size was pretty good and it looks cute enough but after only wearing it for 5 minutes I had to take it off."
2.0,Ugh I’m bummed. This tee came much brighter than the pic which I was ok with I guess. I tried it on (XL) expecting a loose fit but it clung in weird spots and wasn’t oversized. Maybe if you go up two sizes you could get the look. Have to send back…
2.0,I normally wear medium to large. Tried buying XL and still it is too small. Repeat with XXL and still too small
2.0,became flimsy and lost color after about 25 swims in swimming pool
2.0,"I’m 5’11, slim, and my bra size is a 36DD. My bust would not fit in the dress. Taping the inside was not an option."
2.0,"Cute materiel, minimal stretch to it. May need to go up a size if you really want this pj set but it was wayyy to small for me."
2.0,I didn't like how short it was in the back and long in the front I ended up giving it to a different person
2.0,"These are rather cheaply made.  They will not stay up on your leg.  If you like them around your ankle, then you will be happy.  I gave them 2 stars because they are soft and comfortable to wear to bed sometimes."
2.0,"The quality of this strap is excellent; it's the design that's flawed.  The buckle end of the strap is too short to make it to the back of my wrist, it only gets about 3/4 of the way there.  It seems to be beautifully made but, as I said, poorly designed.  Not recommended"
2.0,This is the second time ordering the same product but Medium instead of Large.  The Medium purchased today is larger than Large purchased several months ago.
2.0,Waaaaaay too big to even be functional. Seems like more of a gag gift. And very very dark.
2.0,love but my leanse falls out alot
2.0,Color not as photo depicted.
2.0,"I had high hopes for these sunglasses, but unfortunately, they did not work out and I had to return them for the following reasons.<br /><br />1. When the glasses arrived, one of the booms was loose, so even if I had like them, I would still have returned them for that reason.<br />2. I'm surprised at how many reviews say these glasses are great quality (which was one of the reasons I purchased them), because I all I could think was how cheap they looked and felt.<br />3. This pair of sunglasses runs very small, they were very uncomfortable.<br /><br />I do appreciate the following...<br />1. Arrived with a hand written &#34;thank-you&#34;<br />2. Came with a storage bag.<br /><br />I would say save your money, if you have to have Dior So Reals, save and buy the real thing because these look, feel, and fit poorly."
2.0,not the material I liked returned.
2.0,"Fabric feels like cheap swimsuit material, but the overall appearance of the dress is pleasant which earns it 3 stars. I read reviews suggesting to size up, so I went with a Small. After trying it on, I found the best for me would be an Extra Small (you can see the armpit area is too large for me in my photo). So if you are Extra Small, especially in your top size, don't size up! The neckline is a little bit too low to wear to work without a camisole underneath. I would not suggest safety-pinning this fabric either (at least in the lighter patterns) because it will probably leave a noticeable hole. The overall pros: Great selection of patterns, nice wrap style. Overall cons: feels cheap like a swimsuit which constantly makes me feel self-conscious wearing it. For $39.99, I could have found a better quality dress at TJ Maxx, Marshalls, etc. but will keep this one for casual outings and casual work days."
2.0,"I used these in new piercings and didn't have a skin reaction but I did have to replace the backs with silicone backs because these backs corroded. The posts are quite long and the backs that came with them are very big. One of the earrings was defective it looks like a bead instead of a sphere, but since I needed it for a piercing that day I was unable to return it."
2.0,bought the same size as a previous rubber ring I had and it fit so tight that it was hurting. Plus the center carbon comes off and always gets soap and other stuff stuck underneath it. Look elsewhere.
2.0,"Cloth for slim Asian teenage girl. XL Runs at least one size smaller. I'm 5'6, can't fit into the skirt."
2.0,"While I liked this jacket, it runs REALLY small. I bought the largest size but it was too small. I'm a 14/16. It's more for a size 12."
2.0,These are very cute pantyhose not compression socks. Disappointed in description. Theses were knee high hose.
2.0,While the colors look pretty good<br />The fabric feels cheap<br />And the waist are just too loose
2.0,Much larger than anticipated and looked cheap. Even the smallest size was huge. The first photo is the smaller size.
2.0,It is cheap looking and made. Not worth the time or money. I won’t buy again.
2.0,"Not what I expected, the are fleece on the inside so I couldn't wear them while workout because they made me sweat more. These bands are more fo thhe winter to keep you warm outside."
2.0,Too long. Easily removed when yanked
2.0,It will turn your ear green
2.0,I previously purchased this pair of sunglasses for my son. They were amazing but my son broke them. We just purchased a pair to replace the broken ones.(which by the way would be a 5star) these are a completely different material and feel so cheaply made. Very disappointing.
2.0,"Cute, but very small!"
2.0,"Material and assembly are fine on this piece, but it is oddly shaped for the size. I sent it back because it was too narrow through the hips and waist but fit fine elsewhere."
2.0,Very nice quality but waaayy too small. They told me it was because their sizes are for Asian people who are smaller!
2.0,It’s cheaply made. You can’t see out of the nose at all. It’s small. It would be fine for display once your get it all back in shape but the eyes are made weird and look bad to me.
2.0,The shirt sits right in the middle of my breasts and doesn't seem right. It was thin but maybe it would work for someone with smaller beasts
2.0,These were over priced.  On the back of the package it says 5.99. I payed more than that and feel cheated. Not cool.
2.0,Cut is short
2.0,"MEDALLION BROKE FROM RING VERY QUICKLY! NOT VERY WELL MADE!<br />BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS TO THE SELLER, THEY DID REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT WITHOUT HESITATION! IT'S A SHAME THAT IT BROKE SO EASILY, BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD LOOKING KEY CHAIN!"
2.0,Fabric is slimy slick and slippery
2.0,"I am a plus size women. This vest is much to short! Also the straps are not long enough. The ""ice"" bags were in Chinese and I had no idea what to do with them. You have to carefully fill them with water, shake, and freeze. A little tricky. I think it would keep you cool for awhile, just is NOT made for bigger people!"
2.0,The seams are not flat - they are all wavy and look terrible. The size is also small. I read other reviews that said order a size up - and I should have ordered at least 2 sizes up. The arms were way to short and I feel like the back is going to rip out. Over all - not very good!
2.0,Totally see through but comfy
2.0,"Poor quality construction.  On two of the bracelets, the leather came right out of the clasp the first moment I tried to close it around my wrist."
2.0,Me gustó pero llego sin el reloj de arenacy sin la varita mágica
2.0,They were OK at first. I am using them for a play in our local theater. I wear them for about one hour three nights per week. One of the screws has already fallen out... Now I have to fine a repair kit. I would think that since these aren't just &#34;dollar store&#34; glasses they would last a little longer.
2.0,"I like the look of it, but bought a month ago and sides are already wearing off."
2.0,I'm surprised how low quality these readers are. They're going back Monday
2.0,"Cheap material, ripped on the zipper as soon as I put it on."
2.0,The material is not comfortable at all.
2.0,This is not well constructed.  The seams started coming apart after I wore it a few times during rehearsals for a play.
2.0,It's a very busy looking necklace. I like the little bag it comes in and I like the turquoise necklace but the rest of them look so cheap as well as the clasp. It also came very tangled and one of the bottom necklaces wont lay flat....I'm just not at impressed
2.0,This fit except there was probably about a foot of material I will have to get altered WAY too long even with 6” heels!
2.0,Shrunk 2 sizes even on very low heat in dryer
2.0,Broke right away after wearing it once. Junk.
2.0,"The fabric has no elasticity whatsoever. I’m a size M and purchased L because I wanted to be comfortable but, still, I fell like a salame when I wear it."
2.0,"The neckline of this shirt is huge. If you have long arms, these are too short. It's not flattering or cute. Like someone took a smaller size and tried to stretch it out"
2.0,"Runs extremely small. I bought 5-6X for my niece and it’s actually for 2T. I don’t see how a 5-6X size can fit her when this is meant for a small 1-2 year old. The style and design is cute, but such a shame that the product runs really small."
2.0,"I recommend not buying this. Buyers are better off looking for and buying a more quality suit jacket. I bought what should have been the right size based on the size chart, and it is a little too tight. There's no way I'm going to ever wear it buttoned up. Plus, the color is darker than the image shows. Overall, I have to say this was a waste of money."
2.0,"They are gauges/plugs. They are true to size. They are made out of stone and/or wood. I got a bunch of pairs of them. L<br /><br />That’s what you get, so you can’t be mad.<br /><br />Just know: Once you break the tape on the plastic box, come it does not close again. Have a place to store your new gauges.<br /><br />Second: These gauges are TINY. They fit your size (yes), but they have almost no flare on either end (to hold it in place) and are thin compared to your earlobe length (barely cutting it).<br /><br />They sell you a bunch at once because they know you’re gonna lose them all within six months. One of your plugs  could simply pop out when you push your hair out of your eyes—and you wouldn’t notice.<br /><br />So, all in all, you got what you paid for. Cheap and in-bulk."
2.0,"This thing is a tent and looked like I was wearing a pillowcase. That said, it was a very comfortable circus tent if that's what you're into."
2.0,It's a great idea but when something is messed up on your finger then it stays off
2.0,"The shoes, while comfortable, are not made very sturdy. I expected these to last through at least one summer however they barely made it through 2 months before the elastic on my right sandal came apart. I'm disappointed in their quality but their look, fit, and comfort were fine prior to this."
2.0,"The zipper broke after a month,."
2.0,Bifocal too small.  I have to tilt my head to read anything.<br />The other part of the glasses is fine.
2.0,No se corresponde a la talla que solicité muy pequeño
2.0,Not very impressed. Very light colors
2.0,I usually wear a large but read in reviews it fits small so order a size up. I ordered a XL and it is definately not a XL.
2.0,The strap is not quite long enough to be a cross body bag. Purse is smaller than expected. The material does not appear to be leather as advertised!
2.0,"There is no way these will fit adults! I had 9 adults (both men and women of various sizes) try them on at a Halloween party, and they didn't fit a single person. I ended up giving the entire box away to a teacher for her 1st grade students."
2.0,Very cute but WAY too small in the bust. I am only a B cup but I barely fit in the large. There is a major side boob issue as well. I will have to wear a bikini top or something underneath.
2.0,The capris are cut extremely small. I ordered a 10. The fit like a size 6.
2.0,Good Quality... the band is a bit thinner than I thought and on the Fenix 5x plus it slides back and forth a bit not entirely secure... Can't say I would purchase again
2.0,"There are A Lot of Silver snaps that show more than model pics. Also the thick ribbing around the bottom is odd, it would look better without it. I ordered L but M probably would of been ok (I am 5'3"" and 125lbs). Also fabric is different than I expected."
2.0,The neck gaiters are very thin and kept slipping even for a large head.
2.0,These leggings were extremely see through! I liked the fact they were high waisted but I would not recommend them if your trying to gym with them.
2.0,Ugly and cheap looking in person and they won’t refund or let you return it back
2.0,"Very fine linnen, not very protective against the Corona virus."
2.0,These pants wayyyyyyyy to big now y’all know better than this ..
2.0,"This was huge! The shoulder  fabric was way too big. Cute design, maybe I will order again in a smaller size."
2.0,too short nothing like the picture
2.0,"Product fit as expected but it’s defective, strap sewn backwards."
2.0,Runs large. Quality is poor. Design is cute though... ultimately you get what you pay for. I returned mine they were so huge and because it arrived with buttons falling off out of the bag.
2.0,"I'd like to take this time to give cudos to whomever the photographer was for the image of this dress. I give these cudos because you managed to turn a turd into a gem in the photo.. Lol!<br />This is hilariously gross. I mean I can wear it as a nightgown, so long as I remove it before getting into bed because the excess material may wrap around me and strangle me in the night. The dress is ridiculously large, yet too small on the shoulders to get it to hang off one shoulder like the photo. In order to get the look in the photo, where there is a slit over one leg, you will need to somehow turn the dress and contort your body because the two slits are on each side, not over the leg. I turned the hems up in the image I attached so you can see what I mean.<br />All in all this gave me a good laugh, so maybe it was worth the money. As far as getting myself to look like the photo? I'm confident I can get fabric and construct my own dress, which will look better than this thing!!"
2.0,"Plus size, but the arms are super tight and I bought it bigger so it would be more loose and flowy."
2.0,Received with earrings broken
2.0,Disappointed that this bracelet is so difficult to use. Getting the hair tie on is pretty difficult and the standard hair ties won't fit. Only the skinny ones.  So you basically have to use the ones that came with it.  It is a pretty bracelet though.
2.0,Too loose for my ankle! I will have to cut and sew it so it will fit.
2.0,"Hello, bought this for my son who is 11 going on 12. We live in the suburbs of Chicago. He used this jacket only a handful of times randomly depending on how cold it was going to get. It is a nice jacket, we like it, but with less than 10 uses about 3 or 4 teeth on the zipper broke off! Now the jacket can not be zippered up. Not happy about that"
2.0,It is too small too
2.0,Gloves were meant for children's hands but material has no elasticity so getting them on was almost impossible. It was like trying to put on dolls gloves with two pieces of fabric sewn together.<br />The detail in pattern is nice but would not recommend otherwise.
2.0,HUGE PANTS AND THEYRE PINK
2.0,La parte de arriba queda perfecto compre una talla L por que estoy un poco pasada en mi peso pero la parte de abajo el tamaño esta bien pero la cintura es pequeña realmente hay que tener el cuerpo de la niña de la fotografía para usarlo por que si lo que quieres es disimular un poco no lo hará al contrario con las costuras que tiene entre un color y otro te marcara mas eso que quieres ocultar no fue una buena inversión
2.0,"It’s not as vivid in color as the picture. The cloth feels cheap, thick and not stretchy and too large for the size. I ordered a small as I run by XS and S. Still it was loose and not giving the compression I was looking for."
2.0,"This top looked really cute on, but I am a bit busty and the stretchy part wasn't big enough to hold the girls.  If you're anything more than a B cup, you might want to pass on this top.  Even if you upsize, there's just not enough material to keep your breasts where they belong.  I returned it."
2.0,"Fell apart after two months, couldn't exchange. Very poor quality."
2.0,so small I couldn't even use for myself.  I have petite hands!  I disassembled and glued pieces to my motorcycle glove.
2.0,"Cute dress, but does not fit"
2.0,Not cute at all I think it was the material
2.0,The item was too small and i order a 2x.  The short was wayyyy off in color from the pants i ordered and the products are cheap quality made.  Definitely NOT ordering from this seller ever again!!!!
2.0,"I really like the suit style! It's a super soft material, but it's also super cheap material. The crotch area was poorly constructed and the stitching was coming unraveled. I'm returning it because of this. It's also not double-lined and I think all bathing suits should be."
2.0,Nice and light. They dont really feel like cotton though maybe a mix of something. They reach just below my knee. Im 5ft8 however i'm extremly short waisted and wear alot of clothes on my hips. Since it was suppose to be made of cotton i bought one size bigger. Since cotton doesnt strech. The 40 is too small. I normally wear a 38. The zipper is also not the best quailty.
2.0,I ordered it for the Samsung galaxy 6 phone and it does not fit.  The cut outs do not match up.
2.0,"It was longer than it looks in photo, runs very small and tight. Cute at top, but not flattering at waist or hips. I ordered a large and I generally buy a medium."
2.0,Cute dress and nice material. But a lot of extra material...  Not the most flattering. It adds an extra 2 dress sizes to my actual weight. Will be sending it back.
2.0,"seems to be smaller than other pj bottoms my husband has. couldn’t return them as i never had him try on before i fixed the length. also, they don’t fit over the leg brace my husband wears.  the other pjs do & they weren’t expensive."
2.0,"The stem is so thin and cheap this I give this a fail.  I still like the look, but stem is hokey."
2.0,"This robe fits as expected and has a nice color. It would've been great if it wasn't for the fact that it basically falls apart at the seams. SOOOOOOO VERY CHEAPLY MADE. I wore it three times, and each time long threads were following me around everywhere. I'm literally scared to put it into a washing machine because I think it will just fall apart completely."
2.0,So soft and loose and flowy! The only thing I don't care for is that the pockets turn inside out a lot.
2.0,Funky fit. Had to return.
2.0,I sized up and it was still way too small in the chest and was not flattering in me in any way. I returned it.
2.0,broke after two weeks
2.0,Unfortunately they need to go back. That just not made very well. You get what you pay for. Two large as well
2.0,"Despite what the product picture shows, the actual jersey is yellow and blue."
2.0,"Loved that it was a 2 pack, but when they got here and I opened the package, they were SO SMALL!!  These need to be labeled for a child! Sad that I had to return them."
2.0,"Well is makes a camel toe, its on the short core side, and Im 5'4"" and 148 lbs, its loose on my arms."
2.0,I'm Small or Medium. I ordered a Medium and it was too small for me. I would recommend you to order at least 2 sizes more than your regular size.
2.0,Run small and short!
2.0,"I have a very similar dress from other Amazon seller and it fits really nice, so I expected this one to be like that, but I was disappointed.<br />The size S feels much larger, it fits like size M or something. Not recommended for slim & petite people."
2.0,I bought these because of the description.  I wasn’t looking for flimsy yoga pants.  I need a pair of traditional sweatpants but I didn’t want cheap polyester.  These are 100% cotton.  So there’s that.
2.0,Will need to stiffen up to wear and actually get movement when I move my mouth. Definitely not like the video right out of the package.
2.0,"Pretty fabric, but the fit of this dress is strange. It is baggy in the chest, and the neckline is oddly high cut. Going to return..."
2.0,Had to send it right back because a button was missing.
2.0,I did not think it was a polyester type garment. Probably did not read the description well enough.
2.0,it stunk so bad it took 2 days of spraying and soaking in vinegar to get rid of the musty odor. seems fine now
2.0,"Strings everywhere when I removed from packaging. 2 of them fell apart immediately after washing even though they say, machine washable."
2.0,Had to return this dress. Material is very thin and transparent. You will have to wear something else underneath this dress.
2.0,"My husband is an average size male and it's too small for him. Can only wear it for a small amount of time before his wrist starts bothering him from the tightness. Also, it did not include any information of the stones inside the box so the person that is receiving it as a gift can read about it."
2.0,"They are to big for my ears and looks cheap, but they look pretty."
2.0,"It's way too small. I ordered an extra large, but it fit like a small. I couldn't even get it on."
2.0,"The base of the wig was really bad, the ponytail was kind of okay."
2.0,After the first use the red ends slide out. Luckily I noticed it right away.  I then used super glue to fix the end in place. Glasses look good and comfortable. I would have given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the of the ends.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:74d44288d162786e9182c952eeabd73b]] No encaja bien es las pletinas. Es mucho más ancha
2.0,"Now and then I vacillate when it comes to returning an Amazon purchase. Not this time. It was back at the UPS store in less than 30 minutes. It was too small, the sleeves were short and then there was the ghastly cheap zipper. Also, i had hoped the dark brown was the color of chocolate. It’s not. More like baby poop."
2.0,Not a true black and white. Returned.
2.0,"This dress looks cheap, and feels cheap. You’re going to need a bottle of static guard spray, too. I got the lavender dress with flowers on the top and bottom. The lavender is quite pale, unlike the pretty lavender shade on the model. I really wanted to love this dress. I thought bad reviews were from negative people. Now that I've tried it on, I understand. There are some messed up stitches, which stand out. Oh well. I had to try it, and hoped it would be right for me!"
2.0,Poorly made. My granddaughter only wore once. The shoe has separated from the sole in the front. Cute shoe but just cheaply made.
2.0,"These are super cute, unfortunately I will be returning because they smell so bad of a chemical/pesticide smell.. yuck"
2.0,"I bought this for my grandson's 15th. birthday. It is what he asked for. But when I received it I tried to talk him out of keeping it. It was a XXL and fit to snug for my liking. He is not that big and I thought the size would fit to give him room to wear a shirt underneath. But no way is that happening. So beside the fit and lack of warmth for this so called sweat shirt, I was very unhappy. Especially for the price plus shipping. I would not recommend this to anyone who is expecting to get a nice warm sweatshirt."
2.0,The only thing is the buckle arrived broken so that was horrible
2.0,"These cedar trees will not collapse small enough for a 14&#34; calf/tall riding boot -- twisted it as tight as it would go, no way will it be small enough for a ladies riding boot"
2.0,Fits good. I'm not a fan of the texture.
2.0,"Everything is good about the shirt, EXCEPT the sizes run too small.  I ordered a men's XXL and the garment sent is L at best,  It has no tags other than the one stating made in China 2L, the me 2L = XL,,NOT the XXL I ordered."
2.0,Back is very sheer and is obvious not a blouse underneath. Runs small.
2.0,"The fabric is similar to one of those cheap wicking shirts you get at a charity 5k but less attractive. It is a totally different color, I bought gray, than the picture. I barely got it over my head before aggressively deciding to return it. You get what you pay for and this was definitely as cheap and unattractive as it's pricetag would suggest."
2.0,"I ordered these based on the of 100% cotton, mentioned several times in the description. As soon as I opened the package & felt them, I knew they were not 100% cotton. My suspicions were confirmed when I found the tag; 65% cotton & 35% poly. Honestly it feels like a lot more poly. Although they seem well made & sized correctly, I'm not happy with the misrepresentation and will be returning them."
2.0,Cute but they wont stay on the chickens
2.0,"Fit is okay, just looks cheap, hard to spin"
2.0,This bra is mauve not purple.
2.0,WAY TOO BIG!  It might fit someone if they were a 300 lb man with a full beard. Very disappointed!
2.0,Cute but has a large hole in the seam on leg so I have to return
2.0,"I am a small, I ordered a small, it fit fine.  The material is very thin. The only way I will be able to wear it is if I wear another dress underneath of it"
2.0,"Material was very thin and tight, no wiggle room to move your legs in, should have had a split in back."
2.0,"El pedido llegó según lo solicitado pero sus tallas no cumple los estándares de tallas. Pedí talla L pero en el mercado latinoamericano es equivalente a una M, ojo al comprar no hay que confiar con lo que dice el vendedor y pedir tallas más grandes, al menos con este vendedor."
2.0,Wording is incomplete
2.0,Bug eyes. I like oversize but not this oversized.
2.0,Pretty dress. I ordered a size 6. My daughter usually wears a 6. It was VERY SHORT!!
2.0,long is good but to tight.
2.0,"Pretty, but got wrong size. Too small. I put 00 (double checked) and got maybe a 0 or a 2g...."
2.0,"Runs small, and is slightly see through. Cheaply made"
2.0,Nice looking but way too small. Returned product.
2.0,"This looked really great for the price. However, the chain broke the first time I used it."
2.0,This item is nice but in white so thin it’s see through.  You would have to wear something under it it’s that thin  I have to return.
2.0,"This is a really cute bathing suit, however the LENGTH of the suit is too short. It make it appear as if made for a child. The hip/waist/bust measurements were all perfect, but the length of the suit itself was the major problem. I would not suggest buying if over 5ft or if you don't have a short torso."
2.0,"😊 love it<br />I have before 5 stars but after I made the review the seller send me emails every day to rate a necklace that I even did get it. I would never buy anymore because of the bugging. Not kidding, spam emails all o we,"
2.0,Poor fabric and construction. Doesn’t control tummy as specified. Might be ok for summer
2.0,"I read some of the other reviews and they said this item has a strange smell.  They were right!  I can't even describe what the smell is because I have never smelled anything like it.  It is a cross between something chemically, body odor, and maybe forest fire?  I don't know but it's pretty bad.  This is for my teenage daughter and she didn't want to return it so we covered it with Febreeze.  Smell was still there.  We dried it in the sun after washing it in vinegar.  Smell was still there but it was not as bad.  We put it in ziplock bag with baking soda.  Now it is better and she can handle using it. To be honest, choose something else and save yourself the trouble."
2.0,"It is not good quality. As I was installing it the little pinned that you press to make fit in your watch broke. I was able to install any way but if it was well made, it should not brake so easily."
2.0,"I used this mask to sing in 2 1/2 hr rehearsals & to perform in a 1 hr concert. I found the mask to be hot and uncomfortable; not “sheer” at all. While there is more space with the extra panel of fabric, I didn’t find the ease of use much different from a regular mask."
2.0,It was a heavier duty than I was expecting but there were links missing.
2.0,"This shorts and shirt set is very cute. Fabric is soft and seems well made. However, it runs very small. My grandson is only 14 mths old. I ordered an 18 mth, thinking he would wear it over the summer. It wouldn't even fit him now, and he is on the small side; 30th% in weight for his age. I am returning. Not sure if I want to chance a larger size or just return for refund. But definitely returning."
2.0,These glasses are super cute on! But they make my eyes feel very drowsy and blur my vision. I do not wear prescription glasses or have any trouble with my vision. I simply needed these while attending virtual meetings.
2.0,fits waaaaaaay too small!
2.0,Use of sizing chart lead to me ordering wrong size suit
2.0,"I originally got 1 size bigger, but this was still too small. I had to get 3 sizes up. I should have tried it on before my party because when I finally attempted to put it on, the size was ok but the buttons wouldn't through the holes. It would have been a really good Professor Snape custom if I was able to button it. I returned it for that reason."
2.0,"I thought these would be more of a yoga pant cotton type material but they are extremely slick and shiny, it seem like they would be way too heavy for working out and the shiny material makes them seem dressier then yoga pants.  Just odd, I’m glad I got them for only $6."
2.0,The robe stated fits all well its to small for me gave to a friend so it was put top some use
2.0,I don't know if I'm allergic to this metal..bur it itched and burned.. and it's also very heavy..not for everyday wear.. buy still gorgeous
2.0,Didn't order this bag but it turned out to be nicer than the intended purchase!
2.0,"The dress was nothing like the picture, the colors were off, and the waistline"
2.0,This looks great on and does support. But you would definitely want to go a size up. Which i ordered the wrong size the first time and the second time ordered the right size. The issue I found was when I wore it was i seemed to boince alot with each walk. And the back part would feel like it was moving a lot. I can't describe it. Almost like it would move up and down slightly. So you could hear and feel something happening on your back. Sounds weird I know and it's hard to describe.<br /><br />I got the 34 D which fit great. I had it on for about 5minutes to test it out. And I'm not kidding I got headaches from it.
2.0,They fell apart as soon as I put them on
2.0,The product looked fine but the ticket clearly states BLACK MASKS
2.0,The design was cute material or fabric made dress look cheap.
2.0,Made in china runs small
2.0,The dress fit nice but there's no quality at all in this dress. It's to expensive to return it to chine so y have to pay somebody else for fox it
2.0,Not real thrilled with this watch. I take it off when I sleep and 4-6 hours later it has stopped. The hands are the same color as the X on it so they are very hard to see. I would not recommend it.
2.0,"SUPER CUTE, but the fabric was scratchy on the inside and a button fell off immediately. Not super great quality."
2.0,"So the only con for this item is that it is cute. But other than that it is not for kids, animals falls apart and strings break, didn't even last a week... so disappointing..."
2.0,Very cheaply made... I only paid $7.99 for it but it was worth maybe $3... but served a purpose for my son...
2.0,"The quality of the leather and construction  of this minimalist wallet is great. The pull tab feature is very helpful for getting your cards out of the center pocket. I'm coming from a simple card sleeve and wanted just a tad more space.<br /><br />The deal breaker for me was that the outer pockets which are supposed to be &#34;quick access&#34; are completely unusable with any cards in the middle pocket. The only way to get them out is to take the cards out of the middle pocket first so that you can bend the top of the wallet out of the way to get your finder under neath and grab from both sides, they are way too tight to simply slide your thumb over the card. This is probably fine with something flexible like cash but the whole reason I bought this wallet was to have a quick access outer pocket for my main card that I use every day, and I was hugely disssapointed.<br /><br />All it would take would for their to be a cutout on the bottom of the outer pockets so that you could push the card up from the bottom and this would be in my mind, the perfect minimalist wallet, but as it stands now it's basically a card sleeve with a pull tab. If that's all you want and a pocket on the outside for some cash, this is a great card sleeve, but don't expect to be able to use the outer pockets for cards, there's no point, you can't get them out and may as well just put them in the center pocket.<br /><br />The leather is really nice though and I'm going to see if there is another Andar product that more matches what I want,"
2.0,These won't stay on my feet because they slide off sideways when trying to walk in them.
2.0,The shoes arrived in a box held together with a rubber band. The one shoe was scratched. The fit and comfort level was not at all what was expected.
2.0,"Super tiny, but pretty color."
2.0,"The feel is very soft, comfortable and breathable. However the fit was way too large."
2.0,"Normally a size L in a ladies exercise garment, can be a little more generous but particularly pants would be a little sloppy but would probably fit as exercise wear. This product is not in conformance with a US women's sizing; it is too long in length (goes out across the foot, leg band too large to compensate for the length, too narrow in hips and waist. I am a slim size L, 12-14, but this is weird. Considering returning"
2.0,This chain is so cute but breaks way too easily.l!
2.0,The material was already falling apart before we even put them on. My daughter wore a pair for the first time and the gloves were falling apart. I didn't expect them to be much more for this price but I should have just purchased a nicer pair.
2.0,I was hoping it would be as soft as Santa hats but they don’t stay on that well. I got it for my GI lab colleagues and it didn’t fit some people with a lot of hair. Def for people with smaller heads.
2.0,"the material is nice  BUT  it  rolls around and down from the top, tried One pair & will be returning, this item,  size is also smaller than expected"
2.0,"I had a heck of a time getting them in my ears. I think the posts are slightly larger than regular earrings, because (as someone who wears earrings on a regular basis) I had a really difficult time just getting them in. Also, I don't know if any other users have had this issue or not...but my hair kept getting caught in the stem of the leaf. And it kept happening enough throughout the day that I just gave up and took them out. I was SUPER excited for these to. They're so adorable. But the flaws outweigh it for me this time. Especially for the price. I'll definitely be sending these back."
2.0,"I absolutely love the size of this, it's a shame the clasp broke after roughly six weeks of intermittent use."
2.0,too small for a large size
2.0,I followed the directions and my glasses still fog. It's easy to use but not a good product.
2.0,how do you the materials a lot cheaper than I expected it to be it’s not very stretchy for those who have more hair… They also are smaller than normal Durag‘s so they definitely fit a lot tighter than most but not right in a good way
2.0,"I bought a large and it does not fit! But it fits my 10yr old son's hand. SMH, because they are so cute!"
2.0,"The pros: these gloves were furry and Grinch green.  The cons: they were poor quality, and the finger openings were not wide enough.  I don't have large fingers, but the gloves would not fit my fingers, while the rest of the glove was loose.  I would not get them again."
2.0,"Just got this out of the package, tried it on and it was so tight I couldn’t open my eyes. I have to think these other posters don’t have eyelashes or something going on because there is no movement at all. I can’t tell you if the material is see-through or not because I didn’t even get that far. I don’t know if it’s a complete waste, but only if I get creative with some scissors and a sewing needle."
2.0,"Nice purse, super small.."
2.0,I loved the look. I still do. It doesn't look cheap or anything but it didn't work. The second hand ticked for a few hours a day in the first week but after that it died. For all I know it is a defunct battery or a bad ticker. I just feel like it would cost more than the watch to find out so I returned it.
2.0,"I know they said this was a mini dress, but the length is incredibly short while being very loose everywhere else. Also, the bottom hem folds and wrinkles up requiring ironing. This is not a grab and go dress as it seems. could look cute on the right person, but that person is not me."
2.0,"The Velcro is sewn too close to the top, so both sides rub, and irritate my skin. I won’t be wearing it."
2.0,"Personally, I highly suggest getting this dress customized by them or get it at least one size bigger than your considered normal size as it runs a little tight in the chest. Overall the dress is nicely made and beautiful. BUT JUST AN FYI they make you take down your negative review in order to get a refund which I think is very dumb and on top of that my dress I got from them that was supposedly “brand new” had stains on it. They did contact me and reimbursed me $25 to get it dry cleaned but when I took it to the cleaners they said the stain is so old they couldn’t get it out. So they followed up with me again and I informed them that the stain didn’t come out. They offered a refund but I had to pay the shipping to send it back which doesn’t make sense to me but okay. I refused to pay the shipping obviously and told them I would just update my review in order to get another $25 refund because they wouldn’t refund me for the dress completely. I don’t know if I would go with this company again honestly."
2.0,The sweater I received is NOT soft soft soft like so many of the other reviews. It fits nicely but that’s it on the positives. It has zero cashmere IMO and the wool in it actually makes it itchy. It looks good on but I can’t handle the lack of softness and the itchiness is a total no. Returning sadly. There are ZERO tags btw so that’s a bit of a red flag to me.
2.0,"It’s okay, but it isn’t good for wearing anywhere you plan to possibly sit down. Folds up very easily, even if it isn’t on super tight it still folds fairly easy. I don’t think it’s really worth it."
2.0,"I have not use it as of yet, but it is almost to small for my hands."
2.0,"These run small, even before washing, and the fabric is uncomfortable."
2.0,"Got these and immediately wore them while working in the yard on a clear sunny day.  They never detectably darkened.  If you want polarized lenses at dawn or dusk or even at night, these may be useful, but do little in bright sunlight."
2.0,"Bought these pants for my daughter. Looks & fit wise, she loves them but you will see from our photo that they are a major lint magnet. We have tried everything & there is no getting this off. They pick up & hold on to every piece of lint, hair, whatever. She only wears these to lounge at home now."
2.0,"Lasted 7 months until the clip broke off.  Like the size and form factor, but don't like the longevity.  Now I'm searching for something else to replace it with."
2.0,The anklet is such a beautiful piece of jewelry to add just the right amount of cuteness to your outfit. The only downfall is that it was not long enough. I didn't pay much attention to the size and obviously it was to small..
2.0,Looks cheap like something you would buy from a quarter machine but the material on the pendent looks thick and sturdy but also like it will start to change colors on you after a little while. The chain is very very very low quality I know I didn't pay a fortune for this but I could have found this same quality at the dollar store for a fraction of the price only reason I will not return it is because of what it says and how it fits so well between me and my cousin.
2.0,"The top piece fit pretty good, the bottom however was incredibly small. It must be made for someone with no hips or butt. I couldn't get it up my thighs.  I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 130 ibs. I am not a big person."
2.0,The material is cheap and it looks more like a grandma gown not cute like in the picture. Arrived on time and packaged good.
2.0,The small is a lot bigger than a size 2 US. More like a size 5/6.
2.0,This might be a lady's jacket. The zipper pull is on the left side. The hood has some Velcro patches not pictured in the discription for rolling it up but then the hood/collar is too bulky.
2.0,Color faded from body sweat.
2.0,Very long. Fits as expected. Seems with one wrong or quick arm movement the sleeves will rip away from the actual dress.
2.0,Did not look like picture. And has a very noticeable zipper on the side of the dress.
2.0,I thought for eight dollars this would be a more significant metal key ring. It’s terrible quality  and lightweight. Worth maybe $3.
2.0,I loved all of the different sizes of the bags but Zippers don’t hold up well at all sadly  :(
2.0,Nothing like the picture. This dress is very cheaply made and way shorter than mentioned.
2.0,The earrings took a very long time to get to me but when I finally got it was excited because that looked so cute I had gotten green and yellow ones as well but the blue ones broke without me wearing them and the red ones are loose
2.0,The sunglasses are cute but cheaply made.
2.0,The style of the robe is gathered at the back and a fixed waist tie.  The style makes it looks like you're wearing an 19th Century dress with a butt /hip hoop which makes your rear end HUGE!
2.0,They were cute in theory. I'm 5'4 I wear 14 in jeans. I have thiccck thighs measuring about 28ins. They were long but entirely too tight with no give and rolled. Will be returning asap.
2.0,The light is too dim. You can’t use it to find things. Maybe the batteries are too old.
2.0,"These bracelets arrived in bent condition and with several plastic beads missing on one. They are very light and not worth the price. The company needs to take half off the price. That being said, they are very pretty if they were intact."
2.0,Poor finishing.
2.0,"I though by buying a Naturalizer the shoe was going to be very comfortable, unfortunately after a few months I have been unable to break in the shoe to have it not hurt my feet.  I am looking at others brands."
2.0,expensive
2.0,The purse was a little too big for me.  The leather was a bit too stiff and the inside zipper didn't seem real sturdy. I was afraid sooner or later it would break.  I loved the slots for credit cards.  But all in all just wasn't what I expected.
2.0,Keep falling off
2.0,"I was really hoping for something amazing. These pants do run a little on the larger side which is okay but they are completely see through. I feel like in the pictures you can’t really tell how see through they are. The white waist band is completely visible and the shorts make a marked difference on the thigh. I think if there were pants under, instead of shorts, and covered the white band it would make a huge difference. They are also incredibly long on me. I’m 5’3” and weight 240lbs and purchased an XXL."
2.0,comes undone while wearing it.
2.0,They are pretty but waaaay too small and not 14g
2.0,Never got wet and the gold color is coming off.
2.0,I returned these shoes because they ran small for may daughter. She normally wears toddler 5 and I had ordered her a 6.
2.0,I'm a standard size. this pair of shoes feel a little uncomfortable especially when it keeps giving me blister
2.0,I ordered this thinking it looked like it flowed as was cute for summer. Size was huge and the chest plunges super low. The material was like sweater material for fall or winter. It would be hot otherwise. Would make a good robe. Lol
2.0,Straps cut into mu shoulders.  I needed about an extra inch or so on each strap for them to be comfortable.  I ended up not wearing them.
2.0,"This fell off while I was trying it on for the first time, also while I was trying on my wedding dress. Just fell off, without brushing up on anything. It was pretty, but definitely cheap, and the stones only go halfway up the necklace. I returned mine and they tried to bribe me with a new free set to take down my review. When I declined, amazon removed my review anyway. When I complained they put it back up and now I'm writing the review again. I would not recommend this item."
2.0,Item was ripped at the beginning of the split
2.0,The quality of the charm was great the price was great. The delivery time was awful 2 plus weeks. Hence the 2 star rating.
2.0,I was so disappointed in this item as it did not fit. It was so cute but I had to return it :(<br />I am 5 foot and weigh 150 lbs....this was way too tight.
2.0,"This necklace has much less color than in the photo, and it’s very dainty. As a result, it just disappears when wearing. If the color was more noticeable I probably would’ve kept it, but as it is it just wasn’t worth it."
2.0,Fades easily
2.0,The sizing chart was off on this item resulting in too snug a fit. Also the trim that makes it appear finished in the photo does not live up to photo and gives it a messy unfinished look.
2.0,It is way to big.
2.0,Really loved the look of it and I got a lot of compliments. But it sadly broke within a week. Cheaply made.
2.0,"They are supposed to fit an adult, they are very small and fit an 8 year old"
2.0,It was just OK the band was nice but not adjustable!
2.0,"Don’t waste your money. These socks do not do what they advertise. They are NOT wick away, does not “control” the temperature, not breathable and they are definitely not comfortable or soft. These socks are very rough. Zero softness. I like the tab on the back of the heel and they don’t slip. That’s the only 2 good things about these socks. I’m very disappointed with this purchase"
2.0,It is cute but way too tight
2.0,"I really like this sweater and I'm disappointed I can't keep it.  The material is very scratchy and uncomfortable.  I ordered a size small and have plenty of room in the body of the sweater, but the sleeves are way too short and the neck is very tight.  I have this same sweater in white from another seller and the sleeves and length are as described, and the material is much softer.  I may order the orange from that seller instead.  This one is going back."
2.0,"Arrived with a Missing stone just as a previous review stated. I also have bought from them before and enjoy their jewelry. Shame this one seems defaults. But hey, it was only a few bucks."
2.0,"I received the wrong item. Was supposed to be blue, but I got it in purple. I’m returning this one and ordering the same product again. Hopefully they send the correct product this time. The item itself is crafted very nicely, the quality is nice, I just wish they didn’t screw up my order."
2.0,Looks cute but is much too large so I have to return it
2.0,"Good product, looks well-made and is comfortable. But I bad to order twice because it never arrived the first time and the second time it's too big. Might send it back and get a much smaller size."
2.0,2 small and not baggy as depicted.. kept it Someone in family can wear
2.0,Cheap looking .wear in the dark
2.0,Pattern  does not.line up
2.0,"Calling these ""socks"" is not quite accurate. They were just fabric tubes; there were not in the shape of a foot. Also, they look black, but when they are stretched the white from the next layer shows through. I threw mine away."
2.0,These still seem to slip off the heel
2.0,It doesn’t look as pictured. It’s more red with less yellow accents and the waist band is not as wide so a little disappointing.
2.0,The star kept coming through the moon causing the necklace to fall off. Very disappointed
2.0,"Shirt fits like a 4t but the pants are huge, they fit like a 6/7"
2.0,it felt very cheap and can see the padding inside very easily
2.0,"The color is pretty, however I wish you could purchase each piece separately. Bottoms fit great (size small) however the top felt too tight for my boobs, was not comfortable wearing it by worrying they might slip and make an unwanted flash. For reference my height is 5'9, 141 lbs. and 34C."
2.0,I ordered a small and it’s huge it just hangs on me it’s not fitted. I ordered the pink they show in the photos and what I got was a soft baby pink….not thrilled with this purchase especially not for the price. Wouldn’t recommend!
2.0,It's supposed to be brown but I got the white shad one...but it looks cool
2.0,"Like the colors and hook length, but the stones were chutney."
2.0,Very shear/thin fabric. Completely see-through but the design and back of this dress is so cute!
2.0,"This is neither slim cut, nor is it even a men's jacket (but otherwise seems ok)."
2.0,Returned.  Quality was just not there.
2.0,"Decent shirt, but they wrinkle like crazy!  If you don't mind ironing, they'll do nicely."
2.0,The was way too small.
2.0,Product came in great time and the package looked intact. However my husband didn’t even have it for a whole week when it broke.
2.0,"This item had the back of the neck label sew in with black thread, making 2 heavy stripes thru the back of the shirt.  This has to be an error. It looks ridiculous from behind. Separately, the portrait collar is very wide and would show bra straps. I returned this."
2.0,Very flimsy and once it got wet it was done
2.0,Poor finish very disappointed
2.0,"I was completely underwhelmed with this bag, from the size to the details. In the pictures it looks like it’s completely rhinestone, which it’s not; it’s just small metal circles, the only rhinestones are the top part. Not impressed at all"
2.0,Bought for grandson and broken in a month.
2.0,"Wanted to believe the other reviews but I bought three different patterns of this legging and they are all see through :-( like, without even moving or bending over you can see EVERYTHING. guess the low price is too good to be true!"
2.0,Super cheap feeling/looking material.  Neckline totally unflattering.
2.0,Zipper broke rather quickly.
2.0,"Loved the skirt part of the dress, as well as the pattern. However, the top was way too big... and I'm relatively busty, so I have never been able to say that about a dress before. It is the scuba fabric, which wouldn't work for the event I wanted to wear it to."
2.0,Extremely tight. My son would not use it.
2.0,Too small in the top yet too big in the bottoms.... wish we could get different sizes for each piece
2.0,I Returned them!
2.0,These are super stylish mittens and fit spot on (Medium). The Gore-Tex keeps you dry. The only knock I have on these gloves are that the liner/inside pill (inside liner material balls up in chunks) like crazy and essentially feel like you need to replace them after less than 10 days.
2.0,Normal product
2.0,"They tangle easy and the ""fringe"" part slides so the earrings would become lopsidded"
2.0,"I read the reviews, they said these were thick and wide. I guess not thick enough and definitely not wide enough. They would have been long enough but I couldn’t get my fat foot in that far."
2.0,I wear a 1x tshirt. I ordered a 3x bra. It was way to small. Fit like a large (maybe).
2.0,"Because the bottom of this bag is not gussetted, it holds very little, and the contents must be thin (similar to the concept of a flat envelope).  I intended to use this to carry things to the post office, but it really holds very little."
2.0,I ordered the long sleeve dress and got the short sleeve. Dress is smaller than expected.
2.0,The metal over time loses color
2.0,was crazy small
2.0,Way way too short and not flattering at all. the material is not worth the price.
2.0,You can't wash the onsie or the suspenders bleed all over the white onsie. I hand washed in cold water and it bled everywhere. The onsie has a nice feel to it and appears to be good quality but if you can't wash the onsie then it's pointless.
2.0,Not as thick or long as shown in photo. It is a nice light sweater. Was looking for something thicker and longer.
2.0,"This product doesn't fit like the photos. I chose to pay and wait for international shipping for this brand because of the slimmer waist compared to similar products. Unfortunately, the waist is straight and isn't as long as it appears in the photos. The sleeves were also short."
2.0,"The bag looks nice, it's bigger than I expected. I returned it and the reason was because it didn't come with the shoulder strap to use it as a crossbody."
2.0,they were much too big for my 3.5 yr old- the frames themselves weren't tight at all around her head. Sent them back.
2.0,"I ordered this item for myself but it did not look good on me because it's way too short and wide so it barely covered my tatas. If I reach up, my entire underboob was revealed. I gave it to my 10 year old who is 4'10"" or so and around 95 lbs but does not have the Tata problem mentioned above. The shorts are kind of high wasted so it almost covers her whole tummy. She's only allowed to wear it at home, though.<br />Also something to mention and point out for anyone who, like me, did not look closely enough at the image, todoroki is supposed to be fire on one side and ice on the other.... why is his hair flip flopped??? My daughter still wanted to keep it but it drives me a little nuts"
2.0,The crotch area needs some work. It gave me such bad camel toe. Everything else seemed great.
2.0,I have a hard time finding one's that fit my head right and this was it. Unfortunately it looks like it is ready to fall apart at the top straight out of the package. I'm going to have to be extra careful with it.
2.0,"I like that it’s light weight and easy to assemble but seriously, where is the top piece. Wasn’t in the box at all."
2.0,"It's simple physics. If you're not careful, you can end up ratcheting this belt to the point where there's not enough slack to allow the pawl to release. At that point - as you try to find a little &#34;give&#34; in the thing - it just gets tighter and tighter - to the point that you have to find something sharp, like scissors or a utility knife to cut yourself out (ruining the belt, of course). This has happened to me twice - so now I understand why the leather belt is sold separately. It's a nice looking belt. But be very aware of this problem when putting it on."
2.0,It is actually comical how different this dress is from the photos. Print is pretty and material is thick but soft. Looks like it was seen together in one long stitch.  Big yikes. Immediately returning.
2.0,"This product is falsely advertised, it was not made in Brazil. Made in China."
2.0,"photo shows silver metal, when received it was gold. This leather has a smell unlike any leather I have ever encountered.  Sent it back"
2.0,"Its a little smaller than my usual L but also when i took it out the package, there was a hole in it. The material is a bit thin than expected also. I did the see through test by pressing my hand against the material and put it in the sun and i can see my hand."
2.0,I have other sports bras from the same manufacturer that fit I even ordered a size larger after reading the reviews.Very disappointed. Sent it back.
2.0,Fast shipping but definitely not happy with it. It’s smaller than normal bust and the burlap wasn’t completely on and the burlap is fuzzing  up like a fuzzy blanket not sure why? Not worth the price!
2.0,"Had to use hot glue to reapply the patch after wearing this hat 3 times. Once we fixed it, we have not had any problems. The brand of hat they show in the picture is not the actual brand we received. Our son still loves it though."
2.0,This tank is XL in width but is Not a long line tee. I have regular shirts that are longer than this.
2.0,Fit was good and they looked so cute but there was a spot where the material rubbed off right out od the box.  It was small so we decided to keep them but she wore them once and a couple of more rub of spots.
2.0,These were strangely high wasted but not flattering at all. Not a good cut. I love high wasted pants and these just didn’t do the trick.
2.0,"I bought this pj hoping to get some oversized comfy cozy sleep wear. I’m 5’9” and wear usually L! I bought this on purpose in XXL for the mentioned reason above. I actually received instead 3XL and was afraid it would be too huge. After trying it on I was very disappointed, sleeves barely went past my wrist, pants are way too shirt and we’re even tight fitting though I’m not overweight!! Maybe this works with the ladies of the country of manufacturing but sure not with a European one. The color is also like one mentioned before more of a faded rust color but I would have ignored that fact. Gets send back, useless for my purposes."
2.0,"Color scheme did not match. Purchased blue and looked like each piece came from a separate lot. For instance, the hat was cobalt blue and the gloves were sky blue. Came in a shrink wrap package, so the ear muffs were mis-shapped."
2.0,"The lenses I got were mirrored, not what it looks like in the picture!"
2.0,I bought a size larger than what I usually wear and it was too small.
2.0,These shoes are really fun however the velcro is crap and maybe lasted through four wears and my toddler already can not wear them without them falling right off... I guess just for dress up but I would never suggest them to anyone or get them again. Too bad
2.0,Dress was cute but was too small
2.0,When I opened my package a giant dead beetle fell out onto my bed. One of the earrings broke as I tried to put it in.
2.0,"Really cute necklace, but it broke the first time I wore it! The chain snapped - as far as I know it didn't catch on anything, it was just from the friction of my jacket. I didn't even notice until my friend asked where my necklace went and we found it on the floor behind my chair! I gave it two stars because it was really cute, and because it was cheap enough that I wasn't surprised that it broke."
2.0,The bag is cute-till you see it in person. Looks like fabric over cardboard. I returned it!
2.0,Cheap but gets the job done
2.0,I bought and am returning the Giraffe and Panda sets. So let me start by saying the material is very nice. But I was disappointed when I received these only to discover the t-shirts are cropped! Im a curvy girl and like coverage. There is nothing on here about it so I though I’d leave a review.
2.0,The are wide at the toe which makes it look like a clown shoe. Cheap looking.
2.0,"The fit on this thing is for a taller body woman, on a short body woman the belt is way too high and there is no way to make it flattering. The item was returned."
2.0,shirts ride up really badly
2.0,"LOVEY MATERIAL, WITH ITS VERY TIGHT UP TO, SO I GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHT"
2.0,"This hat came in a plastic bag and was so beat up when I received it there was no way to keep it. I actually like the hat, and the fit is great-but Amazon needs to figure out packaging. I would re-purchase if I knew it would come protected in a box!"
2.0,Second time I wore these one of the seams busted. They are not very stretchy.
2.0,"This bag is really cute, and I received tons of compliments.  But, it started to fall apart within one or two uses.  The vertical parts of the woven bag began to break and fall out, and the bag was starting to lose its woven structure.  It also wasn't strong enough for the magnetic clasp - the weave was giving way there as well.  It is very inexpensive, so I didn't expect it to last forever.  But having it break within a week was too much.  Happily, I was able to return the bag for a full refund."
2.0,"Not what is Represented, this is not two pairs of earrings of Different sizes this is one pair that are the same size and they’re not very good quality with wearing them two times bending significantly."
2.0,Only three of the hoops balls actually screws off. I'll have to try with pliers but so far it's been really difficult.
2.0,Nice quality bracelet unfornately as others have posted the clasp is useless it continently fell off. don't buy unless you know it is perfect size for your wrist. I am 5'7 150 lbs. and it was at least 1 inch too large. For this reason can only give 2**.
2.0,"My glasses fit nicely and I like the pink color, however, it took 3 months to arrive! (From China.)"
2.0,The material was curtain like and not comfortable. There was absolutely no give or stretch to put it on or off either. The neck line was tight as well
2.0,Not solid silver as described.but  looks  nice.a little short too.almost a choker chain.
2.0,The T shirt is cute. However I ordered medium which I normally wear. This top was way too snug. Giving to my 12 year old granddaughter.
2.0,The advertising for the belt is wrong. It looked nothing like the picture. When I put it on it looked off. Like it did not belong. But the dress was bright. A little too loose.
2.0,"The padding is super thick - almost too thick for me. They are also way to large for me and since I tried them on, i cannot return them. I am stuck with them now."
2.0,Way out of sizing ranges...returned
2.0,"First of all let me say. I did not expect it to be a great necklace for this low price. But the product came rotten. Black spots, ughhh. Why would a seller send this product the way it was. Never again buying cheap necklace, to get it filthy. But i can't send this junk back. It will cost me more than the actual necklace."
2.0,The shorts were a good length but we're too small and the material was thinner then expected.
2.0,Did not like. Sent back.
2.0,"My daughter loved the ring, but unfortunately, two weeks later one of the crystals fell out.  quality is not the best for the money."
2.0,"Bra is fine, doesn't lift a whole lot, but it does stay put. 2 weeks later I received the accompanying note in the mail offering to pay me $5 for a review. It specifically warned against not posting images of the mail in my review, as pictures of the actual product are required, so.... Voila! Here's a picture of the bra, they are just ok, but the seller will pay you $5 to say they're great."
2.0,My son loved the bracelet but it unfortunately didn’t come with the meaningful saying. He’s been having a bit of a rough time and the reason I got it was mainly for the saying that came with the bracelet. Very disappointing it didn’t come with it. I am not sure if it was just left out by accident or the advertising is wrong.
2.0,I ordered a 3xl/4xl offered on Amazon. It was WAY too big. I figured this xxxl would be perfect. I was wrong. It’s too small.<br /><br />I wanted a lightweight robe to wear by my pool. Unfortunately both my attempts failed and it’s too annoying to return them.
2.0,Glass are ok but don't fit right.
2.0,These shorts have an uncomfortable material. They have great colors with good pockets. Although they have terrible sizing. There are tight band at the top of the shorts and on the bottom of each leg hole. These create a very unflattering and uncomfortable creasing. I would not reccomend for anybody with slighlty thicker thighs. It also emphasized my love handles
2.0,Used this product as undershirts and they were to small.
2.0,This watch looks cheaply made and the size is WAY too big to be a watch for kids. It looks even too big on my husband.
2.0,I think they look great but the screws get loose more often than not and they wear a little wobbly. I bought a different pair and they were more sturdy than this pair.
2.0,I really like the look of this watch but I feel it's not very durable. I bought this for my husband who literally wore it for 2 special occasions (because he wanted to keep it in good condition) and it broke.
2.0,"I am 5'9"", 135 lbs. Usually I wear a 2 or 4, and I got a medium so this wouldn't be too tight to wear to work. The waist and legs fit great, but the upper part was wayyyyyy too small. I dont have a big chest (34 C), but this was a little sugar around the bust. I barely got my arms and shoulders into it. I dont have really big arms or anything, but I thought I was going to get trapped getting into it!<br /><br />A couple other notes, the seams fell in awkward places, probably due to my height, and the navy was much darker than pictured. The material was nice and thick, it seemed forgiving."
2.0,"If you are looking at buying these buy them one size bigger then u actually need. We needed them really for a one time use photo for the holidays and they worked for that, but the stitching tore and we won't be able to wear them again. To small."
2.0,"It’s was very nice at beginning, but after only a few days, it’s rose gold color faded and became more of silver….not too bad, the not pricey anyways."
2.0,"The photos of this item are much different than how they looked when I put them on. I have small hands, so I bought the small size using their sizing guide. While they fit will around my palm area, the fingers were too long and there was too much space at the end. When I tried to use my phone, I had trouble because the ends of the fingers were loose and would bunch up when I touched the screen. I'll be returning these and trying another brand unfortunately. If you have longer fingers, these would be great. But I find that my hands are average, and these didn't work me, sorry to say."
2.0,The sizes on the garment run much smaller than expected! Would love to exchange for larger size!
2.0,"Lenses fog up & impair business visibility. The attached ear plug concept is intriguing, unfortunately, the ear plugs aren’t big enough for my noble ears. Actually painful when inserted."
2.0,Stopped keeping time after 1 week and one of the buttons on side broke clean off. Inown a couple Lige and not typical. Very frustrating as this is a GREAT looking watch and comfortable.  Really wish it wouldn't have broke.
2.0,"Very short, I am 5'9 and it hardly covered by behind."
2.0,"I like it but not as long as picture shows, material is scratchy."
2.0,"After not very much use, the soles have separated from the body in the front half of each sandal. Will try to repair with cement or Shoe Goo, but not having much hope I will be able to use them during the vacation I bought them for."
2.0,"It's a nice hat, good quality, fits well. But I gave it two stars because after not receiving it for a couple days past the estimated delivery I had to contact the seller and they had to ship me another one. Causing me not to get the hat in time to give to my boyfriend as a birthday gift."
2.0,One of bags ripped ordered an other bag already
2.0,"Way too long, cowl turtle neck is huge, enough material to make another sweater."
2.0,Cheap brittle material.<br />Xloop 4651 is much better.
2.0,It a little big for my 4 month old and material is a lot heavie than I thought. But otherwise it's very cute!!
2.0,cant' get the factory fold out.
2.0,Very bad quality product-after one wash started to fall apart. Would not recommend.
2.0,Could be larger on top sense it is a 5X.
2.0,"Love the concept for holding scissors and pins to the outside of production repair kit, but 2 broke within a week and lost one that would not stay pinned to the bag.  The closure is not secure."
2.0,"Two small, did not fit"
2.0,"I would give this mask a 5 star rating except, as others noted, it's orange and not yellow as pictured. After waiting 3 weeks for it to arrive I will keep it. Technically it's not a standard Smiley face and the orange color is not that bad so I'll wear it. However, this seller needs to make sure that its products are depicted correctly."
2.0,Didn't open it
2.0,Beeds tend to move around and don’t look their best. The material is very stiff and hard to adjust.
2.0,Really wanted to love these but by the 2nd wear the pocket started to come off. Otherwise they are super light weight and very comfortable.
2.0,These are very pretty but super heavy and the clasp doesn't close properly. They are cheaply made. I love this company but these were not worth the purchase.
2.0,"The messenger bag is not bad at all. However, I couldn't fit my iPad  comfortably in it. Also, I didn't didn't find the spacing inside was adequate. I'd also suggest to remove your logo from the front. It takes away the appeal of the design of the bag."
2.0,Material is pretty but my face sweats like crazy in this mask and the mask quickly gets wet
2.0,"Pretty shirt but the shirt looks like it would be long based on the picture, but it isn't.  It barely comes over the waist.  The picture is very misleading."
2.0,"Really disappointing that every piece was under and inch when that's not what the description says. Stones are pretty and shipping was fast so I'll probably order again if my customers ask for finger print sized (I have tiny hands) stones but I doubt it. Pretty sad since so many reviews state they got different sizes, guess they bump all of those reviews to the top. Literally so small I almost threw away two because I didn't even see them in the box."
2.0,Cheap zipper broke before able to wear.
2.0,Does not hold feet . Very loose.
2.0,"it is cute, but the chain is cheep looking."
2.0,"Could not open my watches back. Try on three watches,guess I am a jeweler. Using this tool on other things, not a total waste.."
2.0,Double Anklet broke on the 1st day I wore it.
2.0,Finger tips freeze immediately.<br />Like not having a glove on at all.
2.0,Not supportive in the slightest for a bigger bust . It will cover but cups move around its a shame its pretty fabric . Just not designed for support.
2.0,The colors are orange instead of gold.
2.0,"I only wear size 8 1/2 or 9, but these are too small for me; this is before washing and after wearing the entire day. They also slide down. Will give to my wife to wear around the house. Also found it odd that although they list the fiber makeup on the site, the product itself lists no such thing. Not a fan."
2.0,Material was poor quality
2.0,"I was so disappointed & wanted this outfit to work badly. Most of my weight goes to my thighs and butt. While the blouse was a perfect fit, the pants we baggy and loose. The material is somewhat silly but thick as well. I gave 2 starts based on speedy delivery & the outfit itself is still cute nonetheless.<br /><br />Height: 5’4<br />Weight: 131 lbs<br />Jeans: Size 7"
2.0,I received the slippers and they ripped on the side the next day
2.0,This bracelet is not what I expected. You are basically getting what you paid for. It is very cheap and lightweight quality. This is perfect for a child but it would be too big for a kid. It's big on my wrist. If you have larger wrists then it would be perfect for you
2.0,"These are bright and shiny. Unfortunately, one broke within 2 days. Luckily, my pendant wasn't lost. Construction of this necklace isn't particularly poor, but it is cheap as the price reflects. The description is written awkwardly so I didn't realize I got 3 of the same size. I re-read the description and saw what I didn't catch the first time. I probably wouldn't buy again but I have a back up though I am not sure I want to risk my favorite pendant again."
2.0,"The hats stitching was loose and threaded in multiple areas but this could be as a result of it being jammed into a mail slot it couldn't fit in to causing the package to become unable to be removed from the mailbox and thus damaging it.<br />The smaller items like this are hardly with the effort or money attempting to return them, but maybe that's what they hope for."
2.0,"Did not feel comfortable wearing these booties, since I use a cane, couldn't get enough traction."
2.0,Product looks nice but not very durable. I bought 2 bracelets and they fell apart within 3 weeks.
2.0,"While the high low hem was a cute feature and the color ran true to shown, i will be returning this product for several reasons. 1. The fabric is ribbed knit, and not  soft. 2. The pockets are made with a pleat that keeps it standing open, not to mention it is in an odd high placement. 3. Too big"
2.0,"The fabric is SUPER sheer, like cheap costume kind of fabric. They look cute but you would need to wear something so your underwear doesn’t show through. Also massive camel toe. Don’t really recommend these pants"
2.0,"Lasted for 18 months before the belt tore completely apart at the buckle. The belt was not stretched at the time, and was always loose when worn."
2.0,Pattern stretches out over my fat thighs. Length was too long.
2.0,The dress arrived today and is clear a return. No tags at all attached to the dress or inside the dress. I ordered a large the dress fit like a small. I've ordered many dresses like this and a large always fits with room. There was also a horrible chemical odor. Returning.
2.0,The product came with no instructions.
2.0,Item too small Looks nothing like the pic that's for sure.
2.0,Just hanging in my closet
2.0,its way to tight
2.0,"Rings themselves were okay, however the colors were not close to those in the photo. And when I contracted them I got no response at all."
2.0,came in the little plastic box which was great ad one bll good bit of them are smaller then a 16 gauge more of a 18 gauge had one ball break in half when i tried to remove it.  not thrilled
2.0,"I bought a large. Which is my normal size. This fit like a 2x. The vneck went well below my bra and just very wide. I like the fabric, but not even confident a medium would work."
2.0,The fit and the material of these socks are bad and cheap ...
2.0,"I purchased two of these hats, one in each color for use on the golf course.  I have been wearing the Sol Air Cabana’s for a few years at the same price but like the panama look better.  The first arrived in a well-protected shipping box and the shape of the hat was initially good.  I found the hat to be extremely light and the moisture wicking sweatband materials to be rather cheap and poor quality, something you would purchase in Mexico for $15.00.  I wore it for one round of golf and found that the brim to also be poorly lined and therefore did not shade my eyes as a normal golf hat would do and the shape had completely distorted after four hours of wear.<br /><br />I received the second hat thereafter which was similarly packed but was crushed and could not be shaped.  Both hats were returned for a full refund.  In closing, this hat is completely overpriced compared to other quality hats on the market like the Sol Air’s and really not a golf hat."
2.0,Pretty but too small. Better for a child or toddler to wear. Should be advertised under children's jewelry.  Returning.
2.0,"I was happy with the fast shipping but the material isn't the opal stone, it's actually plastic. Worth way less than what I paid for them."
2.0,Had to return.  Didn’t fit right and the lacing was wrong.
2.0,The color is not a bright purple like the photo and it is smaller than described on the sizing chart.
2.0,"I love the look of feel, but I only wore them one day, and the black is already rubbing off."
2.0,"It's cute, but the tag was sewn on the outside of the back of the shirt.  The snaps are hard to keep closed.  I needed it for Easter or else I would have used their<br />&#34;Quarentee&#34; and returned it. (Hello, trusty seam ripper.)  For $15, I suggest you pass on this item."
2.0,Well made. Form fitting. Except there were no shoulder straps. Just two triangle tops amd then ties near the the waist. If I could knit or sew maybe I could make it work. But I'd rather not have to put that much work in to an item I expected to be complete.<br />I may try again in the future.
2.0,"Loved these shoes for the first few months. Seemed comfortable for my entergetic little one, and they have held up well except for the Velcro closure! The cheap Velcro quickly became a furry mess and the shoes are now useless since they do not stay secured."
2.0,"Well, I like he style, but it's a poor quality"
2.0,I love Billabong fleece sweaters and now have 3 of them.  The one received from this vendor was defective because it felt like there was a string around the chest pinching me tight (hard to explain).  I ordered the same exact sweater and size from another vendor and had no problem.<br /><br />I also noticed that the logo tag looked different from the other Adventure Division tags for reason unknown.<br /><br />The Vendor took the sweater back and provided a refund minus shipping cost.
2.0,"The material was incredibly thin and see through, they run small and the cut is very odd"
2.0,Nice soft shirt. Hole in seem by tag :(
2.0,Way too big. Had to return
2.0,"The clips are WAY too hard for kids to clip by themselves, and they're even really hard for me to do it.  We ended up not using them for this reason."
2.0,"Horrible unflattering shiny fabric, like a cheap swimming suit. Ordered an L size which is what I regularly wear and the top part fits nicely, but has long sleeves and not 3/4. Has enough fabric to cover my XL bottom pretty well, but overall was way too long (I am 5.5). Wouldn’t have been so bad if it wasn’t for the terrible fabric. I am returning it."
2.0,Size seems to run small. Loved the selection of color and pattern. Returned for refund without a problem.
2.0,"Just got it about an hour ago. Couldn't wait to try it on. And it is almost 2 sizes to small. I saw the tag and it says it is made in China. Yet, the seller does not have the Asian size warning listed, as most do these days. Really disappointed. Shirt looks good though. Colors are bright. Material feels nice, not rough. The two front pockets how ever do not have buttons, or snaps. So I could totally see them getting bent out of shape, or having to be ironed all the time. If you work out and have a big build, looking for an XL size, buy the XXL. Asian XXL = US XL."
2.0,I expected way more by the comments. The flower does not look real at all. I’m disappointed.
2.0,"This is a shame because the design and cut of this dress is actually great but the material is like a tissue. It’s the kind of fabric I like to refer to as “cheap looking from a distance”, and the padding in the top feels genuinely like styrofoam. I’ll say again that it’s a real shame because if the materials were switched out for more acceptable ones it would be amazing. I understand cheaper materials = higher profits but this is just greed."
2.0,Didnt fit the wife one size does not fit all for busty.
2.0,very tiny piece and i thought atleast it would lay alittle closer to my neck but even at its tightest it hangs low.
2.0,"I'm on the search for a clear band and thought this would be it. Unfortunately, this is NOT transparent as listed or as shown in the picture. It's more so white, which isn't what I wanted. If clear is what you are looking for, this isn't it. I will say it does seems like a sturdy band if you don't mind the misrepresntation of the color."
2.0,Very very cheap looking but I should have known due to the price.
2.0,I don’t like that it is on a stretch dry fit shirt .... not what I thought it would be... this is a size large and I can wear a medium or a large in shirts. It is more fitted than a standard tshirt
2.0,"Super cute top, but definitely not one size fits all.  With the tie, the waist is easy to adjust, but as a 36A and typically 8 -10 womens topsize, the button holding the upper portion together is straining and the front is completely taut across my chest.  Because of the difference in fit between the buttoned top and tied bottom, the back of the shirt does not hang nicely, but gapes open."
2.0,Bought A 2x for my wife whom wears a xl. It was too small.
2.0,"The style of the jeans were amazing! I loved the flare and they look great with heels, however, even after ordering a size up they were too small. My main issue though is that these are NOT high waisted. I would actually consider them to be low rise jeans which is a super unflattering shape for most people, so just beware of that lol."
2.0,"I have worn this slippers for 2 and 1/2 weeks. they are as flat as dollar store flip flops. They are really cute, but the cheap quality materials really takes away. Also, because of the way the sole sticks out nearly an inch from my actual foot, I catch myself at least once a day from tripping. Don't waste your money."
2.0,The material was cheap feeling and the skirt didn't look good on me so I sent it back.
2.0,the watch looks great but turned my skin green
2.0,Much bigger than expected. Poor quality but still kind of cute.
2.0,RETURNED DID NOT LIKE IT.
2.0,I was soooooo disappointed with this product. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend who LOVES the movie but this product really fell short.
2.0,"Fits weird in the butt area, not a good fit"
2.0,"I ordered a large and it was right up top, but too roomy in the waist. Color is pretty, has a nice thickness, but it’s way shorter than the model pictured. I do have large hips but it literally was a bit below my crotch. I may take to cleaners and see if it can be altered to fit better. I guess for the price isn’t not bad, but to short to wear out of the house. I’m 5’9 by the way."
2.0,Was not comfortable on my hands when I had to bend my hand.
2.0,"Sad, this must be made for chicken leg babies. I have a curvy baby with rolls on her ankles and can never keep them on her as a result."
2.0,"I was SO excited to receive this robe, as I’ve been looking for a plush floor length robe and this was perfect. However, I was devastated when I tried it on and it only went to my knees. In addition, I ordered a medium, as I’m 5’7” and 140 lbs; it runs smaller than a normal medium and the sleeves are just a tad short. I gave it 2 stars because the material is pretty comfy. I set it aside to return, but forgot all about it and the return window closed. So I am stuck with a robe I cannot wear and am out $40 (totally my fault for not returning within the window of time). So sad, I wish sellers would be honest about the product details. Lesson learned."
2.0,The quality of the leather is fantastic.  I am returning the tote because of the zipper closure.  It is awkwardly positioned and placed.  It does not run the entire opening of the bag......just kind of disappointed.  I usually like Kattee bags.
2.0,"I do not like this fit. It’s fine for around the house, but the v neck is awkwardly placed. Like it is a v but fits like a round neck. I am not a fan. I wanted to like this but nope."
2.0,"Basic , which I wanted but they were below that. The packaging was nothing special or cute . My least favorites earrings"
2.0,Color is purple not wine red. Fit is fine but I want what I order.
2.0,"These glasses are made of hard plastic, and the plastic digs into your skin when you wear them while running. I usually purchase rubberized glasses, but ordering them online precluded me from giving the glasses the face test."
2.0,Not too happy with my purchase honestly. The outfit is a bit too large and the print on the shirt is terrible.
2.0,Thick and boxy! Very unflattering and heavy material
2.0,"The design and style are super cute.  But<br /><br />1) The color is more of an orangey-red, not a Christmas red.<br />2) The waist of this dress sat a good 3"" higher than my natural waist and I'm slightly to the short-waisted side of the spectrum.<br />3) It's too short for the style.  The hem was was right at my knees (I'm 5'7"").  The crinoline I got to go with it was showing a good 3"" below the dress hem.<br />4) The Santa design is really cute!<br />5) The waist, bust & sleeves fit true to size.<br /><br /> I'm returning it, but I really WANTED to like it."
2.0,"There maybe quality control issues with sizing. Since many other reviewers stated these ran small, I got a size up. I’m now drowning in a size that is way too big. The material is fine, the color is fine, but the cut is weird besides being off. The cut makes this look like a great Oompa Loompa costume. If you keep your hands in your pockets, it’s not as bad."
2.0,"NO SIZE GIVEN WHEN ORDERED !! GIVEN FALSE PRETENSE THINKING BELT COMES LONG ENOUGH TO BE CUT , WHEN IN FACT THE BELT IS REALLY VERY SHORT !!"
2.0,"Not very comfortable, I had purchased 2 he won’t wear either one."
2.0,"not c as nice as picture ahows. poorly stitched yarn paisleys, not as brightly colored as pictures. soles are dirty looking right out of the box like they have been worn and used already. not happy."
2.0,"They don’t match in color , one is more purple than the other"
2.0,2 zippers won't unzip 3 broke off the 1st day at the airport. The bag its self is ok I guess a little confused by its pockets.
2.0,WAY too small. XL fit my almost medium sized daughter.
2.0,Big and bulky and made of rough material. I wanted to return it but the shipping back to Great Britain is $20.
2.0,Lived them when I got them and now they are starting to rip after a few washes.. won't buy again.
2.0,Loved the out fit however up around the are part too small fits super tight... returned
2.0,These run an entire size too small.  They're cute but not worth the pain of exchanging.  I just returned them.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:a3536548f9d7fe98511f179fe7db7fa7]] Very cute and bold. I wish the rod was shorter because it twists and ends up upside down. But its very cute and very noticeable.<br />*** updated*** do not buy.<br />I almost had to remove my piecing because of this earring. The paint pealed off and infected my ear. Poor quality. I've had it 1 week.
2.0,"Very pretty dress but the arm holes were too big and you could see my bra, not matter what kind I wore."
2.0,"The mask could be nice, but it was bad ending manufacturing. See yourself in the pictures."
2.0,Too small and the colors are not the same and the fabric is not what I expected. It did come fast.
2.0,"Picture shows collar size difference compared to shirt bought ""in store"".  Ordered a small and received correct size. However the neck hole is way bigger than I like. The fitting is just off compared to shirts I've bought ""in store"". Its much shorter and wider. When I raise my arms it comes above my pants which looks silly. The standard t-shirt fit should pretty much stay in place. The sleeves are rolled up and sewn in place which is not good for me given I don't like that style. Tag says 35% cotton, 65% poly. Softness would be medium bc the other shirt I ordered was 80% cotton and it was super soft however this one did soften a little after washing.  I picked the green but in person its so dark it's almost dark gray. The other shirt I mentioned was dark gray and they were almost identical in color. That one fit all wrong too by the way. So I'm 0 for 2. I wanted to order online giving t-shirts are cheaper than buying at a local boutique bc I find it crazy to pay over $20 for one. For now on I will pay that 5-10 extra bucks to make sure it fits well and not be totally bummed after purchasing."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:38a2775a0bb4142d283fccbfeac98e51]] I'm a 00g and per the reviews it seems this company hasn't quite figured it out. One was too small another too big. IDK if I want to try the 0g or just let it go and keep the handful I have. It's frustrating.
2.0,Underwire came out soon after washing.
2.0,"I waited a month for these and they can PURPLE! I like purple but wanted grey, from China no chance of returning :/"
2.0,Worthless don't spend your money.  The whole thing unraveled by the end of the night my friends were following me with a dustpan since I was shedding everywhere.
2.0,Was expecting better. The bag does not look as nice as in the photos. Cotton is on the thinner side & bag itself looks cheap (like a backpack for a young child)  mostly because of the ridiculously thin poor quality straps. Very uncomfortable to wear.  Not a good dupe for fjallraven. Interior is like a lunchbox (again childlike).
2.0,I thought this would be a big bag but it was small
2.0,its strong but it messed up two of my metro cards be careful with cards
2.0,Size ran small . Had to reorder
2.0,"Definitely not what i expected. i always order mediums, this was too big, paper thin, very cheap looking. Was very disappointed with the quality of this cardigan ."
2.0,"Cute cover up but unfortunately the “one size fits all” sizing description is very inaccurate.  I typically wear an XL in cover ups, (could probably get by with a large but I like them a bit bigger!) this one didn’t even come close!  If you wear L or XL, skip this cover up!"
2.0,There is no tight band across the face area. The wrap continues to fall down around the neck.
2.0,"I gave it to Starz cause it is very pretty. However this ring is not going to hold up, it's way too bulky for between the fingers, the prongs are all bent so I'm pretty sure the stone is going to fall out at some point and the rose gold looks more like a copper and pretty much will probably rub off at some point. Not worth sending back May wear it occasionally for short periods of time."
2.0,Fit weird with wide loose bottom and snug near top. But had funny shoulders that stick out.
2.0,I sent them back. They were really baggie and frumpy looking.  Nothing sexy about these daisy dukes
2.0,It’s just an ugly fit. It’s one of those items that’s too big and too small at the same time. It does nothing for my figure.
2.0,Very disappointed. I like the style and cut but runs very small and the quality of the fabric was not great.  The color and style was exactly what I was looking for. I will be returning it.
2.0,I am soooo sad. I ordered a XL and it's way to small on the top and bottom. I would get a larger size but I'm a afraid they just won't work at the end of the day.
2.0,Missing the backs.
2.0,Yeah this is hard pass for me. I  ordered large to make sure it fits. Yeah it’s enormous and I thought ok I’ll wash it . It came out uglier and it has weird fit.<br />Looks nothing like picture
2.0,"very cheap looking, unfortunately :/"
2.0,"These are awesome glasses. The ink flaw in the flag print doesn't really bother me. The crookedness of one of the flags is bearable, but there were scratches on the inside of the lenses and an oily residue like they'd been worn before... that bothered me."
2.0,"I ordered M  based on the size measurements in  listing:  Medium was way too small , I could not button it in front. I would have to order a large or extra large for it to button."
2.0,Fit is strange. I'm not too curvy but I have some shape... I think you have to be a stick figure to look good in this dress.
2.0,This dress is gorgeous and it fit perfectly BUT...<br /><br />It was not worth $50. The fabric reminded me of a Hanes undershirt. I hated to send it back.
2.0,The neck hole is super small! The model shows the draping shoulder and my head barely fit through the hole. It's also tighter than I imagined. But the material is nice and sheer.
2.0,"Beware: Shirt looks good, runs way too small, says to order one size up, I wear a Large US, so I ordered a XXL to be safe, still to tight for me, if they offered a XXXL it may fit better, I hate tight clothes, you should tell people to order 2 or 3 sizes up, not one size up, I ordered 2 sizes up and still too small, who wears these, midgets ?  make a XXXL so we can wear if we wear a size L USA,  will give it to my nephew who wears a Med, Amazon, Please address your sellers on this matter, they should not be allowed to sell with you when they give false info, then if we return, we have to go through all the trouble and you have to pay for shipping, Also, very cheap. wash on delicate, hand wash cycle low, on cold only,!!  No Dryer ! hang dry only,  will shrink to 5 sizes and start too fall apart , this is a 8.00 ebay shirt from prob China, Amazon, plz step in on these sellers, this is why we all left Ebay, thank you"
2.0,"This outfit came today and was not the same shirt in the image. This was a lace dress on my daughter. She is going to an event and its to late to return. I had to cut the dress myself to try to mimic the image. Lol. Very disappointed with this purchase, BUT life goes on"
2.0,Bought these and she wore them for a few months before they started falling apart
2.0,"Super cute band, but I’ve only had it a month and 4 of the rhinestones have already fallen out. I’m sad because I loved it when I first got it."
2.0,"I ordered a larger size as advised and it's still too small in the hips! Absolutely no stretch to it, so I hope this fits my little sister :("
2.0,"I have gotten other satin pajamas through Amazon and absolutely love them. The idea of the brush back really intrigued me. The material is very nice. The cut is horrible. The pants run small in the waiste. The top is too snug at the waiste, large in the shoulders and the buttons come open. Nice material doesn’t matter if the fit is wrong. My usual size is large. That’s what I got."
2.0,"I ordered a size 4.5 and got a chinese 36.  There is no other sizing even on the label like other shoes we have gotten.  Comparing them to the current size 4 skechers my son has, they are smaller than those.  The shoes look sharp and appear solid...but run SUPER SMALL.  I don't recommend since there is no way to tell what you will actually get."
2.0,Fit was fine but disappointed in quality. Both of the ears were barely attached and I had to sew  them  to secure them.
2.0,The color advertised was a bright yellow and I received a dark and dingy colored yellow that looks lixed in with other colors. Quality is excellent and I love the bag size. Disappointed to have to return it.
2.0,"Beautiful product but crappy workmanship, right out of the package one glove had a rip in it by the stiches. I had to sew it up with needle and thread. No good."
2.0,not a really good sizing chart for this
2.0,"The bracelet was cute, but did not come with crad as described. The card tells about the bracelet and making a wish and would have been nice to gift that way. Totally disappointed."
2.0,Very big!! Not like picture
2.0,"These aren't that well made, the material is thin and a bit odd, BUT they work well for costumes"
2.0,The straps across were loose fitting and large. Material just looked a little cheap to me. These were not my favorite sandals.
2.0,"I ordered this bag to carry to work as I didn’t have a lot to carry with me. I only used it for about a month and the strap just completely ripped off. It wasn’t on a seam, the “leather” strap just ripped into two pieces."
2.0,not 3 ply
2.0,"these stones look like cheap fakes. how can these slick polished stones absorb anything. They say lava, but don't look like lava."
2.0,"The necklace is as described--looks quite nice, but like many who have bought this, I paid nearly $20 for the necklace because it was supposed to come in a pewter case, which would have been worth the $20 charge--But I received only the necklace, effectively meaning I paid $20 for a $9 necklace (based on prices of similar items on Amazon) -- This was a rip-off plain and simple since the seller could have contacted me to offer a discount for just the necklace, but they did none of this -- Dear seller: please change your website description to accurately reflect what you are selling--Run out of pewter cases? Change the Amazon description, plain and simple..."
2.0,nose piece sticks out way too far. completely blocks cross vision... not good for sports where you need to see the ball.. would work better with thinner padding to let it fit closer to the face.... provider says no options are available to change pads????????? others offer this option....
2.0,"they're quite uncomfortable/kinda painful to wear, eventually I just took my lip piercings out and let them seal up because it was a lot less uncomfortable."
2.0,The shirt is kind of a small sit I bought I usually wear a large but the shirt fits kind of tight and the fabric is a little too thick for my taste. It's to be expected when buying clothes over the Internet
2.0,"Not the same dress as pictures but still liked the print. The quality is very cheap though. I kept It, but won’t recommend since is not what I was Expecting."
2.0,it does not look like the picture were the front is long... only part of the front panel is long.  It looks crazy on a woman with large breast that does not drape all the way down to the waist. The model is actually covering up where the front panels stop midway down.
2.0,It's not the color that appears to be.
2.0,"Nice glasses and great packaging, but I could see my eyelashes reflecting and the nose guards kept falling off. I sadly returned them."
2.0,"I love the look of the watch but it totally STOPPED working. Replaced the battery, its just dead"
2.0,"Item took a little longer to get here than I would like. Feels cheap and not very strong. Ordered 15mm, which is the size of my Adidas watch, but it was slightly larger and was harder to get the pin in that holds the strap in the watch.  Now that I've seen it and have it, wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,Cheaply made and the seams quickly busted
2.0,I didn't receive the correct hat.
2.0,Won’t hold shape
2.0,"I was SO looking forward to getting these earrings!!! However when they arrived the ""mottling"" that is described and what is seen in the photo is very different than what I received. The earring has very very little ""mottling"" to it and the other earring has even LESS ""mottling"", it's practically just a cream color earring with a black splotch or two on random parts of the earring. SO disappointed. I'm returning them but will debate ordering another pair in hopes that this was a one off shipment."
2.0,The size was too large
2.0,Unfortunately after waiting two months for the dress it came damaged. The zipper was broken. Not waiting for the third attempt for them to get it right.
2.0,Definitely not OEM
2.0,"not a very good prouduct,very itchy"
2.0,The clasps all fell off after very minimal use
2.0,"The pants are nice enough, and they’re cool in the heat of summer because of the wide leg and lightweight fabric. But it’s definitely not made from a cotton linen. The tag reads 100% cotton, but it’s not an open weave and it feels more like a cotton poly crepe. I’d give it 4 stars if it didn’t claim to be linen because they’re still lightweight and they fit as expected, but the description is definitely misleading."
2.0,"The chain was broken when it arrived, but it wasn't worth sending it back. I figure I can replace the chain at a later date to reused."
2.0,I like the blue hat just fine but the black one I ordered wasn’t in the package...
2.0,Hat can in an envelope super crumpled up and still month later is not formed like picture. Although it does have a wired hem around brim so you can reshape it
2.0,"These are super cute I gave one to my friend for grad but it broke the day we got it, it’s too fragile."
2.0,"Unfortunately i have had nothing but trouble with these.  When they first arrived, they appeared they would do what I had wanted them to do; block out noise for my son who has difficulty in crowded areas.  I didn't have the need to use them until a few weeks later, and the one ear piece continued to become disconnected.  Any time we took it off or put it on, the ear piece became detached.  Very disappointed."
2.0,The hat was smaller than it looks in the picture.  It isn't quite a hat - more of a hair decoration.  It has a pin on the back so that it can also be worn as a corsage.  I returned it with no problem and appreciate the seller's painless return policy.
2.0,"The material and the product is great. Im only giving 2 stars because of the product inconsistency. I ordered the 3 pack one and it was great. I then reordered a 2 pack one thinking it would be the same size, but the 2 that came was larger. I thought it was all one size."
2.0,"I would rate this a perfect 5 stars. But I only received the top and not the bottoms, I contacted amazon and I was told I would have to return the top and get a credit the order I bought. But I only wanted the bottoms sent to me without doing all of that. Needless to say please be aware of this!!!!  The product is a nice"
2.0,"Fits well and all but the colors are way brighter than advertised it's a light grey on top of a less light grey no actually dark tones on the shirt, would have nice if it was darker colored"
2.0,"Bought for someone else, didn’t like fit"
2.0,This watch broke in 2 weeks. Not a good purchase
2.0,I'm very disappointed. These are adorable however they are very big. I got 0-6 months and they wont fit until my son is about a year old. Also they are NOT orange. I stead they are brown. They look more like a deer then a fox.
2.0,"This watch band is fluorescent yellow. As in construction vest yellow. The picture made it look like it was more of a lime green yellow. I didn’t even take this out of the packaging. Yikes.<br /><br />Besides the color, this band is amazing. I have it in other colors. It is soft, with slight stretch, and secures with Velcro. Love the band, not the color."
2.0,This was a present for our boss for Christmas and unfortunately the 2nd time she wore it one of the leaf points broke off.
2.0,They were cute and I liked them but the lends had a scratch on them....
2.0,"Nice material and pattern, looks like a nightgown on my tall slender frame. Wish there was an extra all"
2.0,Rather dull looking in reality. Live and learn.
2.0,Arms are super short
2.0,One out of three arrived damaged. Second one broke first time using. Thirds holding so far.
2.0,"The leggings were used for a Halloween costume so the quality wasn't super important.  If you are looking for good quality then these leggings are not what you are looking for.  After wearing for two Halloween events with a washing between and after, the pants had pulls all over them.  I was hoping my daughter would get more use out of them."
2.0,"Fit just right and very comfortable. They are not waterproof. Just walking in a couple inches of snow, my feet are wet by the days end.<br />The soles are more like hard plastic"
2.0,Pretty enough but they arrived with two obviously missing stones on each earring. I sent them back for a refund. Quality should be better
2.0,Super cute but the zipper broke the first time I washed it.
2.0,The sizing was completely off.
2.0,"Loved the idea of this but the material felt a bit halloween costume-y (like that shiny-ish material) and the skirt was very pronounced mermaid-y - not like naturally hitting your curves but forcing the mermaid shape. This made it look a bit too formal for a night out.. but the material itself and the look made it look not formal enough for a fancier event. So it’s a bit confusing and I while I love the idea of the outfit, I personally wasn’t impressed with this one. Will return"
2.0,"They arrived crushed in the package.  One was intact and the other crushed. Very fragile, not good for an earring."
2.0,Really tight in the bust area.
2.0,I've ordered with a couple months apart. The first shirt which I gave to a friend was wicked awesome felt authentic. So I ordered for myself recently and what I got was the same product but made of aluminum and not steel.... So at least from my experience you have 50/50 odds of getting something great
2.0,"The bottom fits perfectly, but the top does not.  It's made with a cheap material, this causes my boobs to pop out a lot.... not cool."
2.0,Not impressed.  Went on a whelm and bought these after seeing them advertised on TV. They are heavy and not comfortable.  In addition they don't hold a good soap lather on them when using them.  Would like to return. Trash! Regular gloves and a sponge will do me fine.
2.0,I ordered a US small...I would like to know who they measured. I am drowning in this thing. Unless your atleast 6”2 I wouldn’t even bother
2.0,It shrinks in length each time it is washed.  It stretches out around the bottom. The longer you wear it the bigger it stretches out!
2.0,"The quality is fine, but the sizing is a joke. I'm routinely a M and the M bottoms fit ok, but the cups of the top were like a size XS."
2.0,The fabric looks and feel cheap<br />👎
2.0,Hole in fingertip of glove
2.0,I really like the concept however it would have helped if the belt was a little wider. It tends to separate once you move around around and bend and twists. Definitely couldn't see myself comfortably wearing it and the gym. Also you'd need a loose top to avoid the velcro end.
2.0,I had this and the matching wrap and they are so cute together! But the fabric is a loosely woven easily snagged fabric that i did not care for.
2.0,"Too tight, 5'6, 115 lbs and ordered small. Gave me muffin top"
2.0,"will only work on eye glasses with the thickest of frames,"
2.0,"Took a long time to receive. Disappointing color and looks cheap, but I didn’t not pay a lot...so there is that."
2.0,"This dress is super pretty and flattering. Unfortunately, I only got to wear it once. When I tried putting it on a second time the zipper broke. I tried fixing it with a repair kit but could not get it to align again. Very unfortunate and disappointing. Given the price I might buy it again, but not sure the quality would be any better."
2.0,"Metal buckle too heavy but otherwise sturdy, well made."
2.0,"I am 115#, 5’3”. I ordered a small. It is about 2 sizes too small. Even the sleeves are short and it barely covers the bottom of my breasts. I can’t even take a photo of me in it, because I have standards! On a positive note, it’s soft & the color black is good."
2.0,The pearl is a nice size
2.0,"This seems to be made okay, but the material is scratchy, has zero give, no shape (very boxy), & looks like the top half of an unflattering nightgown. I never usually order anything w/a lot of polyester, but since I was planning on wearing it over shirts w/full coverage, it wasn't a deal-breaker. However, I won’t be wearing this, because it doesn’t suit my style."
2.0,"Received as a gift replacing a very worn non-RFID leather hinged money clip credit card wallet.  I really wanted to like this wallet but have found the following issues: 1) card capacity is somewhat limited 2) difficult to shuffle through and find the correct card 3) If you are not carful when returning a card you can dislodge the O-ring and its lost forever.  This has happened several times and the Wallum website is out of replacements 4) money clip does not have enough pressure to hold &#60;10 or so bills, 5-20's will simply fall out.  I can't recommend."
2.0,"The piece is beautiful. I was excited to come home and wear them, but one came broken."
2.0,Terrible quality...Giant lint balls after the first wash and had 2 pairs get a hole in them by simply putting them on for only the second time. Very disappointing
2.0,Just done nice comfortable leggings nice come with pocket. That’s all. PJ look only
2.0,It's not an African print.  The material is very thin and more like an animated printed Mexican- Indian dress
2.0,"it is smaller then it says and there are a lot of little strings sticking out off it to snag,, not gonna last very long if worn."
2.0,"The item arrived it a plastic shipping bag. When I took it out, it did not look like a helmet. I had to clip the face guards together to try to bend it back. They still pop out in weird positions. The material is a type of rubber. The horns don't fit in the holes properly and fall out easily."
2.0,Didnt lile
2.0,"Product was Far too small.  I purchased this product for a halloween costume, and ended up not even using it. If you intend on purchasing, anticipate 1-2 sizes too small."
2.0,Have ordered several other pants from this brand and these were absolutely huge. Normally a high quality brand but felt like this specific pair of pants was not as nice.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this cover up and bought it specifically for a trip to Mexico. Unfortunately, it arrived without any strings. Not sure how one is supposed to wear the item without strings, but it was returned. Oh well, maybe next time."
2.0,They broke at the bridge two weeks after initial use.  Really hard (tight fit). To get them in and out of case.  Disappointed- but they were what they were. 20 bucks two weeks!
2.0,"I purchased 3 different colors in this style and they were really cute until I tried to get the ""sticker"" off the front and realized it was actually numbers written on the glasses! I had to ask my husband to verify that I wasn't crazy and there wasn't a sticker there! That ruined it for me. All 3 went back. And I looked at the pictures and they do show the writing. Disappointing."
2.0,"These were cute and practical, just what I needed.  The sizing is super small.  I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 117 pounds.  I ordered larger from reviews, x-large, and it was dinky....short arms and just an unusual fit.  For the right body structure this would be good!"
2.0,Runs very small and the white is very thin and see through. The material is like spandex. I'm just not a fan. I'm giving it away.
2.0,"I just received and tried on.  The waist band is no more than a 1inch piece of elastic.  The fabric is thin and stretchy but without compression.  I am 5'8"" and about 175lb so I ordered an XL thinking I would need to size up from my normal size of large.  I may have felt like there was more compression if I ordered a Large...but I doubt it because the material is too thin.  I do 25-30 minutes of HIIT workouts every day at home and I wanted to try some longer shorts than what I currently use, but these won't provide me with what I need.  These are an inexpensive set, so I knew I was taking a risk with ordering them.  I might consider keeping them for ""lounge-wear"" shorts, but I would rather get my money back.  I will be returning them."
2.0,They are super cute but almost unwearable because the back scrapes up the back of your foot and causes pain. I'm so sad. I might try and tape something on the back to prevent the scraping
2.0,"Threadbare and poor quality material. It's like the Spirit Halloween of cardigans. Looks good from a distance, but you don't necessarily want your picture taken in it."
2.0,Broke after a month & a half. Only giving an extra star because it was comfortable before it broke.
2.0,Definitely way too small for anyone who is the least bit chesty even in an XL
2.0,These socks are adorable and I love the colors. They are extremely hard to get on though. They will barely go over the heel of my foot and I wear a size 9. They were a christmas gift or I would return them.
2.0,"A stud fell off one of the earrings, the only thing I could see on the seller's page about returns directs you to amazon returns and says within 30 days.  It was just over 30 days so I guess I'm buying a new pair because my mom loved them other than that."
2.0,Color was great but not my style.
2.0,"I got the blue pair of replacement lenses and although they are pretty good, I think the polarized part might be screwed up on mine. Disclaimer I haven't owned a pair of polarized ones in like 10 years but on the pair I received the bottom half creates like a red hue and the top half is what you would expect form a normal pair of none polarized sunglasses. The main problem is my pupils sit right at the boundary between the two so I can't really use these without being extremely annoyed. But as far as build quality and fit they seem rock solid."
2.0,"No fue lo que yo pensaba, tuve que hacerle varios arreglos."
2.0,Loved the product but the leg warmer fell apart after 2 months. I don’t use it as much so i’m surprised that it came apart so soon.
2.0,the top is too straight and not made for my face because it doesn't enhance my face...
2.0,"This jumpsuit is so cheaply made I had to return it. Don’t bother, seriously. It wasn’t made for a body with hips/butt/boobs."
2.0,This PJ set is so comfy to sleep in or lounge around the house in without feeling embarrassed if someone sees me. The seems are already coming out though which is quite disappointing since I have worn and washed this item a couple times.
2.0,Ok I read so many reviews saying how short this dress was and how tight the sleeves were so I ordered an x-small and then a small just to be safe. I am 5’2’ 118 lbs 32 C bra size. Anyway this dress is enormous and by no means short! Both sizes came down past my knees and both were loose and bulky in the shoulder/sleeve/chest area. I would not recommend unless you are taller. I will be returning both dresses. It’s a shame because if they fit properly they would be very cute.
2.0,"Button fell off before even wearing. Shirt is way shorter than it looks in pictures. Definitely would not buy this brand again.<br /><br />Update: after writing this 2 star review the company attempted to fix the issue. Because of the poor quality I did not want them to send a new shirt in this style. They sent a different shirt- short sleeve with lace sleeves. While the shirt feels much better quality than this one, the size is still off. I am a medium in everything I wear. This shirt is labeled a medium but definitely fits as a large. This one I will still wash and try to shrink so I can wear. This is the reason I have changed this review from 2 to 3 stars."
2.0,Love it .. so pretty..<br /><br />unfortunately one of them broke off …and lost the entire earring
2.0,"You get what you pay for, looks cheap."
2.0,Made cheaply no warmth and too big.
2.0,good lenses but the coating were off within 3 days. I only used  sunglasses wipes
2.0,"There are dark ink spots all over the white print. Makes them look like they're moldy, honestly. And in case you missed it like I did, they are hand wash, air dry only. I recommend finding something different."
2.0,Not what I what is expecting good material but it's just not for me I am small frame and a small was to big for me wish they will come extra small
2.0,I wanted to love this dress...I really did...but it just didn't hit the mark for me.<br />Pro<br />Plenty of stretch. For reference I'm 5'5 220lbs and the XL fit with room to spare.<br />Cons<br />Very uncomfortable. I don't think I'll be able to wear this dress all night. The sequins are very itchy.<br />The off shoulder straps hang...weirdly.<br />The dress is not floor length. Hits me right above my ankle.
2.0,Purchased the 20mm but it's more like a 20.5mm because it doesn't fit in the watch brackets and I accidentally scratched my watch to get the band in place. I took a diamond file to the sides to get it to fit in the watch since I only had to take a tiny bit off of each end. I'm sure this will reduce the integrity of the band long term but oh well it was only $8<br />I have a 5 inch wrist circumference and this was too loose- causing the heart rate feature to not work on the watch and the watch face rolls around to the wrong side of my wrist. I'll end up altering this myself also.
2.0,"The shoes appear to be good quality. However, they are not the correct size. I ordered a Toddler size 6 and they are WAY too big. She'll likely not be able to wear them for a few years."
2.0,"They are attractive, lightweight, and very comfortable.  The problem I'm having is durability.  This will be the third pair I've had in less than a year.  The hinge on the temple breaks making the eye wear useless. On break occurred when I fell asleep wit the glasses on and must have rolled over on them.  The other break happened when I accidentally ran into the main entrance door to the building where I work.  I continue to purchase replacements because the price is good and my prescription has not changed therefore my lenses fit."
2.0,"The material looks cheap, also the straps are bad quality, mines came out in like 2 weeks"
2.0,I LOVE this pattern and I really love how this dress fits but the tie on the left side of my dress was hanging on by a thread. I shouldn't have to repair a new dress before wearing it. I would buy so many dresses like this if the quality was better.
2.0,Fits perfect after I adjust it with the tool provide. The tool broke However I managed to size it and finish. I got the black band and the color is already coming off. Should have got the silver one.
2.0,"I'm 4'11"" and 125 lbs and this dress, even in XS, was huge on me. The cut wasn't flattering at all. Giving two stars because the material felt well made and  return process was easy."
2.0,I bought these as a Christmas present - the packaging is very nice (it's a plush satin bag).  The earrings themselves are a LOT bigger than I thought - almost 2 inches.  They are nice earrings just be aware that they are quite large.
2.0,If you move your head or eyes they go out of focus. Not worth $40.00. Maybe 10.
2.0,Its card slots were pretty tight
2.0,I got these because they were the only joggers I could find that weren't too long for me. They do fit. However the material is shiny and it started pilling after 1 wash. They look cheap and ugly.
2.0,"I was NOT pleased with this item.  It was very flimsy and did not have an appropriate clasp to keep it in place on my ear.  They were cute, but not useable."
2.0,"came in way too small and short, not made for tall people"
2.0,"Received product in a timely manner. Seem to be well made. However, I ordered large. I received two large and one extra large."
2.0,See through material... not only that I got the medium and it was extremely tight..
2.0,Made in China.  Thick and hot.  Soft yes: but they slip off your face.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"I loved the look of this but once the product was in my hands I was disappointed.<br /><br />I will probably keep this in my jewelry book for if there is a time where I need to wear my smart watch but need a ""fancy"" look but it will not be something I would use regularly"
2.0,"The material of this skirt made it fit small and uncomfortable, also the slip underneath barely covered top of thigh. Not flattering on a bigger person. Had to return."
2.0,I really love the fact that this has the pockets that can hold the iPad. I would like to see those type of pockets behind the breast pockets on more of these vests.<br />The material is lightweight and appears to be reasonably good. Sadly it’s very small for a 2X and the torso is very short. It should be another inch or two longer at the very least.
2.0,GETS TANGLED A LOT
2.0,"These are pretty, but too tight on my head, unfortunately."
2.0,I was not happy because not enough space to put stuff..
2.0,"Waaay smaller than sizing chart. Front too small to fit even one testicle in. Back cut was tiny and super low cut, covered only 1/3 of the butt. Waste of money. Basically a completely different product than advertised. I don’t think the model was wearing the same brand."
2.0,"They’re cute and nice for wearing around the house, but after wearing them twice, there’s a rip in them. Right on the side seam. And the shorts were baggy on me! Disappointed I was only able to wear them once."
2.0,robe ill fitting.
2.0,The bra is beautiful but the Cup size is smaller than those regular one purchased in store.
2.0,"I like it but too small. After i read the review, i bought XL. I wear M to L. But it was like super tight. Like XS."
2.0,Pins were cute but half of them were bent and not useable.
2.0,I saw the reviews other folks put up about the screws falling out and decided to take a chance anyway.  Many times I read negative reviews and I find that some of those folks got a defective unit and/or were unlucky.  I go out and get the item and I experience none of what the negative reviews described.  The review about the screws falling out on this wrist band were put up a number of times.  This is one time I wish I had listen to the negative reviews.  My band lasted 4 months before the screws fell out of the part the anchors the strap to the watch head.  It had some loose 2 months after I got the band but I noticed it and tighten it with a small eye glasses repair kit screw driver.  The last time it fell out I didn't notice any loose screws and when the screw fell out I had no choice but to remove it and replace it with the original rubber watch band.<br /><br />It was a great band while it lasted.  Buy at your own risk?
2.0,"It's good quality, but the size should be adjusted by ordering one size up!"
2.0,it was wayy too short i literally can’t wear it anywhere😭
2.0,They look fine if you can ignore the rough finishing of the metal.
2.0,Never asked for my size. Dress fits to tight on my arms
2.0,When I first used the cooling arm sleeves I was happy with how it really did cool my arms but it wound up tearing and falling apart.
2.0,Stopped working in a week
2.0,I know it’s a crop top but you need to be completely flat chested to wear this to look anything other than a bra
2.0,"Although these are cute, they run VERY small.  I have been getting a size 9 in Sperry sneakers for years!  I have several pairs of different ones - mostly the Crest Vibe types.  I was excited that these were leather (or at least leather-ish) instead of cloth, thinking they wouldn't get as dirty as the cloth and canvas ones.  However, these ran really small - the size 9 I always get was ridiculously tight and uncomfortable. Order at least 1/2 size up!"
2.0,"I ordered these two times and both times received a size 13D instead of the size 9D I had  ordered . Otherwise, they are great looking shoes, but that doesn't matter if they don't fit."
2.0,You get what you pay for the fit was good but I don't like the ring because I thought it would be shinny like the picture but its dull
2.0,Was not worth bothering to try to return so I gave it to a friend who is about four sizes smalller. Will NOT work for large chested women. The sparkly center was a separate crop top that was not stretchy material at all. So if it doesn’t fit a little it doesn’t fit at all.
2.0,"Material is not as good, and some you can feel the glue piece inside which might not be good for newborn/infant’s forehead area when wearing it.  The fabric also has this unpleasant smell (smell like plastic somehow)"
2.0,"I bought these because I have a visual Impairment that requires very dark shades. These do not block light sufficiently, and although they fit width-wise, they have large gaps underneath that allow light through. They are as fragile and insubstantial as a pair of child's sunglasses bought at a supermarket. They are worth the price, but certainly not the added shipping charge. They came in a small cardboard box without padding, filler or protective cover. I cannot recommend them."
2.0,Color of purse was not the same as color in the picture
2.0,Not soft and doesn’t wash well with the ruffles.
2.0,"I love the PJS, but they’re not true to size"
2.0,"I bought these goggles to wear as part of a Boxtrolls costume.  As other reviewers mentioned, these were originally black goggles that the company has painted with rustic paint.  The goggles looked really nice.  However, the paint came off all over my face.  I would wear the goggles on the top of my head from time to time because they steamed up due to heat (I was outside, and I live in Florida) and the range of vision is limited.  When I looked in the mirror, my face had black all over it; over the eyes and all over my forehead from sliding them on and off."
2.0,I wear size 10 and they don't come up as far as shown just above ankle. And you have to wash them 2 or 3 times or it feels like they have sand in them
2.0,"For some reason I thought this would be embroidered or just well-made, it's just a decal that was printed onto a cap and it is slightly Askew. Pretty disappointing but not worth the hassle to send back so whatever."
2.0,Very thin… Shows everything through the stretchy material. Not flattering at all.
2.0,"Super comfortable * so cute* ...wide...<br />definitely for wide feet, but charming!"
2.0,thus we my second order of the black. they changed the material and I didn't like the feel.
2.0,"Great until the first wash, then the neck stretched out immensely"
2.0,"Love the pattern and colors, unfortunately it fits terrible  the material is not flattering . Shows every part you would rather cover. I have 3 other alegra k dresses in medium, this one i dont think a bigger size would even make it hang better. Darn i loved the picture and wanted it to work."
2.0,Disappointed in this cuff.  Pretty but doesn't stay on your ear can't bend it very tight.  The two additional things they sent are almost useless.  Have this a two star only because the cuff is beautiful.
2.0,The reason I ordered this set was for the round pair and it looks like there are many varying shades of rattan. I’m disappointed!
2.0,"Other then the strap breaking within a week of using it, I really like this wallet. I wish it didn't break! The color is perfect and its big enough to fit all my cards and my cell phone. The strap frayed after a week of normal use, no pulling or swinging it. Was poorly made. I want to order another but other reviews show straps breaking easily too, so I won't waste my money."
2.0,already broke
2.0,"The bathing suit is cute, but it’s not designed well. It’s cut too large around the legs."
2.0,"These tops the minute you wash them will shrink and I already have a hole in one of them.  I bought them to sleep in, so I am not so upset.  Don't expect them to last a long time or be something you can wear out!"
2.0,I liked this watch band. But after nearly a year the clip became loose and started to scratch me. I tried to repair it but it just would stay put. Otherwise this was my favorite band/strap.
2.0,"Felt very cheap like polyester, Arm's are very short like a small girls shirt Thin, Run's small."
2.0,Looks nice during my second time wearing it a chain fell off. You get what you pay for I guess still looks OK.
2.0,Was way smaller then expected
2.0,"I'm pretty disappointed that for $60, these are defective. The left insole is bent and adhered to the bottom of the shoe bent. It created a very hard lump under the toe. I wore them half a day today and have a blister from the defective shoe rubbing my foot. I'll be returning these and spending extra money on shoes that aren't defective. These are not worth $60. I know they're synthetic and inexpensively made, but they're also poorly made. For $60, I would expect at least a comfortable cheap shoe. These are maybe $20 quality shoes."
2.0,its kind of a bathing suit material super clingy.  it looks cheap and the tie dye isn't as vibrant as the picture show.
2.0,It was advertised that it wouldn’t smell and could be worn multiple times before holding an odor because of the cinnamon. After one use it smelled of bo and had to be washed. Otherwise it fit great and was very thin and lightweight. Overall I liked it but thought it was way too expensive for what was advertised.
2.0,I can’t imagine who this would look good on. My fiancé literally asked if I was going to churn butter. Not sexy at all like the picture. I returned.
2.0,Too small and I was really looking forward to wearing this
2.0,Some work some didn't.  I would order a significant amount more than I needed.
2.0,"EDIT: got the 2XL, and it’s perfectly oversized (maybe a little too big but it’s for sleeping). It is really soft, but I do not think the fabric I received is the same as the product photo. This is a thicker polyester/spandex blend. The product pictures looks like a lighter cottony fabric. The tie dye is clearly not blending as well on this garment as it is in the photos.<br /><br />EDIT: They sent me the wrong size. I ordered an XL but got L. Still reordered in XXL let’s see if they send it right this time, and if it’s loose and hella oversized like I want.<br /><br />The fabric on this is SUPER buttery.<br />I would recommend sizing up about 2 sizes if you want the flowy look in the product picture. I sized up 1 and got the XL, but it wasn’t as “oversized” as I was hoping. Also the top was little too cropped for my liking. I’ve ordered another set in a XXL to see if that fixes the issue."
2.0,small thin. very disappointed.
2.0,"The lights on one of the shoes only stay lit for 3 minutes, at the most. Returning the shoes now for a refund."
2.0,"2 bras in this purchase (they come as a duo) - but bras were grossly different in sizes.  The black was smaller, narrower in the band, and had shorter straps.  Thought maybe seller just made a packaging error but no response when I reached out to them.  If you buy this - expect to only get ONE bra in your size.<br />I would have given them 4 stars if both were the same.  My only complaint is the difficulty in fastening the zipper.  They need to improve on that."
2.0,They are very comfortable to stand in but dissapointed in the stitching on the inside. They rub my toes. Would’nt wear them for walking a lot. Blister would form
2.0,"The bracelet itself looked good.  But the clasp was lousy, it was coming undone all the time after just a week I lost it after it had come lose without my noticing,  so unless you want to be in the market for a new one I would get yourself a better clasp."
2.0,heavy and bulky.
2.0,Item cannot be put in dryer which wasn't mentioned
2.0,"Too thin and clingy for me.  It’s almost see through even though I get a dark green color.  Not a flattering fit.  Very soft, though, and the color is beautiful.  I am going to use it as a nightgown."
2.0,"I mean if it's your style then thats cool but i hated how it fit, very unflattering"
2.0,I received a completely different apron without any pockets
2.0,Zipper was horrible.
2.0,It is not at all like it appears in the picture. It's not made well at all! It also runs big. Very disappointed with this purchase.
2.0,Writing this review for my husband. The fit was weird. He’s not tall nor does he have a long torso. His usual size is Large but he ordered XL so it would be a little big and comfy. It was super short in the length and sleeve length as well. He was wearing a T-shirt when he tried this on and the Shacket bottom was hitting just below his belly button (easy 7-10 inches shorter than the tshirt). The sizing was very weird. The tag says US XL made in china. He was so disappointed because he really wanted it to work. Also the colors while the same style were much darker than pictured. Almost like the product picture was under a super bright lamp/flash when it was taken. I didn’t even get a chance to take a picture because he immediately said “no.” took it off and we put it back in the packaging to send back.
2.0,I returned. It was like a large on hips area but 5xl on thighs and ankles
2.0,"The size is smaller than the actual size. If your size is small, purchase midum."
2.0,"This is cute, but you get what you pay for. It runs on the small side, and is a little thin. I would size up one unless you want it to be very fitted.<br /><br />I’m still deciding if I will keep or return."
2.0,The fashion print great but the quality not great also even u adjust the band it still loose.
2.0,The fabric is too thin and flimsy.  Too high waisted. Should have ordered larger size. My fault
2.0,"Overall it's kinda cute, but the bust is designed really strangely and the cross pieces sit oddly against your boobs. Definitely order a size up."
2.0,That's cute but after couple weeks broke apart .
2.0,"Way too small, you can't even see them."
2.0,"Very cute but it came broken! Also, it is to big for my wrist. Spend more money to get something with better quality."
2.0,I wore 2 pair since I got them yesterday and they both ripped in crotch area i guess u get what you pay for. They were comfortable but my job requires me to actually work not sit down all day
2.0,broke VERY easy
2.0,Not up to the mark
2.0,This was a gift for my very petite teenage granddaughter.  Forget Womens/girls...this wouldn't have fit a reasonably sized 10 year old.
2.0,Would of been great except underwire pokes into.your side right from start and you can tell it will poke through fabric in very short time so not very comfortable but looks great and good stretch
2.0,The pictures weren’t clear and were dull. 😢😢😢
2.0,"If I had known this watch would arrive with the battery included in the package rather than being installed in the watch, I would have made another black cuff watch selection.  It still hasn't been worn due to a recent hand injury which has prevented me from installing it.  The band is too snug to be worn comfortably when it is ready for wearing, although I do not have a large wrist ( 6-1/4 inches.)  Two other cuff band watch purchases have been made for summer wear, and I like them both very much."
2.0,Lightweight but not enough adjustable support.  I don't even wear this bra.
2.0,This item although it is well made it did not line up with the (4) hooks on my bra.
2.0,"The strap lasted a little over three years and then broke on one side where one of the holes is, an obvious stress point.  Also be aware the backlight doesn't illuminate the whole display evenly, it lights up mostly the left end and barely lights up the right side.  Other than that it worked as expected.  It has a one year warranty.  I was at Walmart and some of them have two or three year warranties, including the Walmart house brand.  Anyone know what the tiny little &#34;U&#34; on the face is for?  You'll hurt your eyes trying to see what that is."
2.0,The shirt fits too big I’m a size medium and I’m not that big and the shirt is really big on me
2.0,"This is a poorly made item. The hood is  much smaller than shown and there are strings everywhere making it look cheap.<br /><br />The fit is fine for me (I'm 5'6&#34;, 125lbs), and I will wear it occasionally (after cutting off all the extra strings). Its not a cute as the photo shows."
2.0,"The fabric looks really cheap, like its just screen printed. I don't have high hopes for this shirt."
2.0,"I usually wear medium/large. I got the large and the arms were too tight- no room for layering, the definition of fall. Arm length to long too. Gave the jacket to my sister who usu fits a small. Wish it had worked out."
2.0,To small. These barely cover my 7 year olds face.
2.0,"Made a skirt out of it----after I washed it, this did not fit anymore..."
2.0,It's really difficult when you read + and - reviews.  I took a chance - I wouldn't buy them again.
2.0,Back of shirt was much shorter than front.  Washed one time and got a hole in it.  Really dissapointed.
2.0,I really liked the keychains. They are really nice but after a couple of months the hook on the chain broke so that's why I gave them 2 stars.
2.0,"I didn't realise the sleeves are split and open at the shoulders otherwise I wouldn't have bought this. I love the print, the fit and the material I just wish the sleeves we completely fabric and not open."
2.0,Missing hat
2.0,Did not like product at all
2.0,"Really not comfortable while singing. At $20 a throw, this i expensive."
2.0,"just ok, had to work to hard to clean silver jewelry."
2.0,"Cheap, clasp broke"
2.0,They are so cute in the photo so I ignore the not so great reviews and purchased for my 7 month old. The size is perfect but the stones look a bit dull. Immediately when I took them out I noticed they posts were dirty. In the bright light of my bathroom it appears to be eat crust or gunk like they aren’t brand new. Then I remembered another review mentioned the same issue. The backs don’t stay screwing very well which is the whole reason I bought them.
2.0,"These are cute charms, but my bag which held the charms was opened inside of the amazon bag and there were only 68 charms (not 100 pieces like the description says). I would like to be sent the missing 32 pieces."
2.0,It’s a nice piece. It’s way to big.
2.0,The siza was MUCH smaller than a normal 5X
2.0,Really cute necklace but in less than a year the chain had turned green; no jewelry cleaner helped.
2.0,"Very decorative, but some lights don't work, very disappointed cuz I liked the look of them."
2.0,"I should have known better than to buy a jersey designed and manufactured by a Chinese company as they usually have little to no understanding of the fit requirements of cycling clothing, let alone the body structure of men from the western hemisphere. The design is cool which is what attracted me to this, and the material is good but there are a number of negatives. It is advertised as a men's Jersey but the zipper head is on the left which is the position for women's apparel. I am 6 feet, 158 pounds, with BMI of 10 and wear a size 28 pant.  I ordered a Medium which is my usual size in jerseys. It is a &#34;Pro&#34; fit but the waist elastic is tighter than it should be and the front length is one and a half inches too short when compared to Italian and American made jerseys.<br />I'll keep it but my advice to others, which I will now heed myself, is that if you want a good fit only buy American and European designed cycling gear."
2.0,They are comfy but the fuzz sheds all over the place! There is pink stuff all over the house. I would not recommend.
2.0,"Too big. I bought some before and they were tiny, but these are so big."
2.0,"This dress itself is very cute, but it's waaay too large. I'm 5'8"", normally 120lbs, but 7months prego and this dress swallows me. It is definitely not made for people smaller in the bust. It hangs down everywhere. Bust, underarms, .. I wished it was more fitted, as I absolutely love the print and would've made a great maternity dress."
2.0,This is way more bulky that pictured. It was too heavy so it wouldn't stay where it was supposed too. I could see this causing pain after wearing it for long periods of time. The size of the stones make the whole design look squished.
2.0,"Feels cheap, thin and sticks to skin. Returned it"
2.0,"This hat runs really small. I am a medium sized female and the large is tight on me. It does not fit my husband, whom I order it for as a gift. They do not offer an extra large."
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress...but it's not like it's pictured...  I don't think it's cotton, it's rayon...and it was a small vneck, not round like the photo. I returned it.<br />(ordered the green)"
2.0,I had it 1 day and it started falling apart. Bummed.
2.0,Very pretty but they run small
2.0,One of the seams split on the first washing.
2.0,I ordered a 36 and yes the tag says 36 but there more like 32. Order 2 sizes up or save your money
2.0,"Would not recommend this product. I bought it last year and i am just opening it to pack for vacation and i realize the back is completely see thru. I will not be able to wear this without shorts in which you will not be able to see the design. Do not order yellow, order a darker color"
2.0,Cheaply made and far too small. XL is more like a medium.
2.0,"if you get it wet once for a second forget about it,( I hopped in the shower, realized it, took it off that second but it tarnished immediately) I was bummed, for a costume it would be good for one night the price was cheap but this is made of the material that you get jewelry out of the twenty five cent machines at the grocery stores.If your skin is that type that turns green due to costume jewelry I definitely wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"Lasted 3 months before they fell apart. They look cool, but don’t last."
2.0,Cute but it's way small! Good thing it was cheap because it doesn't fit st all.
2.0,"Super cute and fits well around the waist, but way too long. Had to return"
2.0,this charm ia nice but..much smaller than i expected. tiny tiny.but its a Disney charm it will work.
2.0,"Nice watch, but very large and heavy. band is for a very large wirst and is not adjustable. will be a gift for someone with a large wrist as it is useless for me."
2.0,Only really good for one or two wears the gold started to come off after a second or third wash I suggest hand washing this item. It also runs small aside from that it's very cute.
2.0,"I didnt care for the skirt. I am 5'9 and so it was too short. It just didnt look right, the material was very thin and cheap."
2.0,Way too small which is a shame because it's nice for the price.. if you want buy it in two sizes larger.
2.0,it broke but she her dad was able to fix it.
2.0,When the earings were delivered and I open the package they looked nice.  I wore them for 5 days and they started to change colors already.  The price was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,i had to return this as it was huge
2.0,Cape covers front only. This needs to cover the back also. Not quite what I wanted.
2.0,"the product the fabric was nice but it was kind of not well cooked.  He didn't stretch much and the arms were too  tight, the pant broke just to try it in , The good thing that the material was light and i did not sweat much .."
2.0,"Title says it all. The fabric is thin, although not transparent. Stitches are loose"
2.0,"Suuuuuper short. Won't be wearing this out. But, I didn't expect much for only a few dollars"
2.0,Too small despite one size fits all notion.
2.0,"The idea is genius, buuuut I really wish the visors weren't foggy. After the first use my daughter oxygen filter had come apart from the mask. The mask seem to be comfortable for my daughter and I love the adjustability."
2.0,"The bag is really sturdy and I love the design, but I was astonished to see that it came in plastic wrapping. It's highly ironic that the message on the bag is &quot;Say No To Plastic&quot;, yet it was wrapped in plastic. Very disappointing."
2.0,Not true to size. It’s a lot smaller.it’s a cute costume though
2.0,The decorative paint on the temples (arms) is a cheap sticker that quickly wears and peals off the metal.
2.0,I honestly should have seen it when I ordered but the hands and gloves are more of an Oscar the Grouch green and the head is like neon green. BIG difference and they look goofy together! The gloves are very generic and not formed like the Grinch's hands at all! The hat is too short and super thin/ cheap. The santa coat is paper thin and CHEAP. The pants fit okay and seemed decent but the color is just awful. The mask sadly is like smashed inwards and it fits weird on my face. The eye holes are SUPER small and it's like looking thru a pinhole camera trying to see out of this mask!<br /><br />Just terrible in every aspect and super cheap! This costume should have been $30-$40 for what it is!
2.0,The dress itself was really cute but I was swimming in it. I ordered a medium and I dont think it would have fit me even if I ordered a small.
2.0,Very sharpe & will not stay in place. I've went through all 3 guards & they slide on ring side to side . Thin metal.
2.0,The top and the bottom weren't lined up properly so that the vertical white lines were askew at the middle seam. The dress comes with pockets that are lined with thicker fabric. The pockets added bulk to my hip- exactly where I don't want it. Really stretchy material which was comfortable. I really liked the color green but ended up returning because of how it made my hips look.
2.0,"Despite being advertised for a woman, this wig is too small for an adult female. I do like the color and cut of it though. But those become moot points if it simply doesn't fit on your head."
2.0,Ill fitting- not made for thin wrists. I had to tighten the chain to the point of discomfort to keep my watch from rolling around constantly. Returned it almost immediately due to this but for some reason I am not getting a full refund. Buyer beware.
2.0,Ordered and was very tight size chart is very wrong!! Size at least 2 sizes bigger!!
2.0,Was really excited to order these shorts however after opening and trying on the shorts I was able to notice the following.<br />1- Theo shorts are long on the torso which is unflattering.<br />2- The shorts rise up to high in the front and gives the appearance of camel toe (which is gross).<br />3- I’m truly disappointed so now I will use the shorts to just lounge around in the house.
2.0,I had high hopes for this skirt! I am 5'8 165lbs (I usually wear a size M-L or 8/10) and I ordered the large. When it arrived the fabric is darker than in the picture and the second I touched it the static took over! I couldn't even move because the fabric clung to me so much. The skirt was also way too short. An XL would have been too big in the waist. Sad that I have to return this : /
2.0,"Should state that they are Asian sizes,  waste of time"
2.0,Nice hat but shipped in a large envelope in lieu of a box.  Hat was squished flat as a pancake.
2.0,I think they are good quality socks. I think the price is ridiculous. Too high. I think they take advantage of certain type of the person that needs the sock.
2.0,so plastic - y the clear lens doesn't look clear enough
2.0,no size on  sweatshirt.
2.0,Bottoms very thin...see through
2.0,Was not as long in the front and not for larger sized girls.
2.0,"Fabric was pretty and nothing was wrong with it, but I wasn't a fan of how it fit me. It will hide figure &#34;flaws&#34; (truth: really no ones figure is flawed at all, but I understand the train of thought). This is a drapey, flowy dress- some will like that, but I felt like it hid my shape completely."
2.0,"These were SO cute and have such great lenses that I wanted to leave a five star raving review.... until three days later the plastic part of the frame cracked and broke off in THREE different places, as if the hard plastic center had already been broken and just a film gloss held it together.  I was so gentle with them and kept them in a hard glasses case and everything.  :( Very disappointing, because I loved them enough to wear every day!"
2.0,Dress fit like a tent and fabric was thin.  Would be a decent beach/pool coverup.
2.0,"Following the recommendations of other buyers, I sized up from a Medium to an X-Large as this seemed to be a common thread.<br />Unfortunately, there was more downsides to this dress than there were plusses.<br />It's accurately described as an &#34;Illusion&#34; dress all right - the photographs certainly give the illusion of a really pretty dress but that's all it is, I'm afraid.<br />On the plus side, the colour was accurate and pretty in real life.  Because of the stretchy lace, it felt comfortable on.<br />That's all I could find to say in its favour.<br /><br />In the debit column, here's what I saw immediately.<br />So immediately that I knew that this wasn't a keeper for me.  I 'm glad it seemed to work for others, though.<br /><br />1.  On me, this frock was unrelievedly DOWDY and frumpy.  Like a dress Blanche Du Bois packed to visit Stella & Stanley.<br />2.  The static cling of the 'lace' over the petticoat was constant.<br />3.  The folds did NOT drape in the graceful, artistic manner shown in the photograph!  It was as limp as Meg March's tarlatan frock;  the<br />  one she wore to Sally Moffat's party in &#34;Little Women&#34;.<br />4.  The lace (faux though it was) lacked crispness.  Totally sans elegance.<br />5.  Lace looks OBVIOUSLY CHEAP.  Not a quality polyester.  Wasn't expecting Chantilly Lace but this was skimpy and limp.<br /><br />This dress MAY work excellently for you if you're a perfect fit for the size.  I'm 5&#34;6' tall, by the way.<br />Because of the stretchy lace fabric, it accentuates every bulge and curve you may not want accentuated.  This is NOT a forgiving dress that can kindly and gently hold you in in all the right places and float gracefully over the rest of you.  Not by any means.  You'll notice the model in the Dressystar product page is tall and slender as a reed and even she looks bland in it.<br /><br />Yasmeen Ghauri - known as the 'Body of Death' in her heyday for her ability to make the gangliest, ugliest schmatte look couture-worthy - even the divine Yasmeen would be hard-pressed to imbue any semblance of glamour into this dress.<br /><br />I'm slightly in awe of some of the reviewers who looked wonderful in this dress.  Snaps to them.  Wish I knew their secret!<br />I so wanted this dress to work and look nice on me.  The length was perfect for a Formal afternoon-into-evening Wedding.  I even took the trouble and ordered a separate tulle, fifites-style underskirt/petticoat to give it some extra 'oomph' and fullness as some reviewers recommended. I paired it with high heels and I still looked matronly;  NOT a look I was aiming for!  My first reaction when I saw myself in the looking glass was guffaws of laughter, followed by disappointment.<br /><br />You've heard of Mutton Dressed as Lamb, right?  Well, I looked liked Mutton dressed AS Mutton.  I was aiming for a fitted waist Grace Kellyesque kind of dress:  instead of Fifities lady-like dressiness, I somehow managed to channel Tennessee Williams instead!<br /><br />Oh well, it's only a dress.  It's just that it LOOKS so pretty in the photos and I thought I'd scored a bargain.  I returned the dress and petticoat.  Couldn't bring myself to wear it even once.<br /><br />Thank-you for reading my thoughts on this dress.  I hope you'll have better luck with it than I did at any rate."
2.0,I felt like I was wearing a bag!
2.0,"Very poor quality, strings falling out. The shap was awful"
2.0,As described. Too tight at the waist.
2.0,"I gave this to my daughter who is a hospice NP. She used it to clip her car fob on her rolling office bag as she visited nursing homes and patients' houses, as it was easy to set off the car alarm if she put it in her pocket and she didn't want to have to take her purse in with her during her visits.  She was very happy with it the first day, not having to think where her fob was after each visit.  Half way through the second day, as she was was rolling her bag to the car, it fell off. It broke at the hinge. It was jostled very much where it was clipped to her bag and she only used the clip to put it on in the morning and off on returning home. It fell apart without being touched."
2.0,Was cute but oversized! Ordered for my youngest girl and ordered her size and it was a lot too big! Definitely size down!
2.0,piece broke
2.0,"The material was okay, pretty good for a full-body jumper. I just hated how it looked on me. There was too much material and it just looked like a red bag on my body."
2.0,I also didn't care for the fabric
2.0,"The fabric over the bust is sewn awkwardly, fit is v strange."
2.0,"OK, so this item took about 5 weeks to arrive & I won't return it cuz I paid less than $4 with shipping so I mean.... cmon! I will be giving it to my daughter though, cuz it's simply too tight & I'm sure it won't last long. The heart is too heavy for the necklace so only remains upside down. At the longest hole it sits right into my cleavage and at the shortest it fits right at the start of my cleavage. It is as pictured in terms of the gold/heart/beads, but the crystal isn't a crystal at all - it's a cheap plastic piece that has a strange hue to it which looks super tacky. I attached as many pics & views as I could. I wouldn't recommend this purchase."
2.0,one of the rhinestones has already fallen out and I have worn them twice
2.0,Only if you plan to wear as a gown.  Too thin to wear out though I do love the pockets.
2.0,The blouse was to large and the material was really thin.
2.0,Broke before I even wore them.
2.0,cheaply made did no wash well either
2.0,The color isn't what I see on screen- it's a bit lighter
2.0,These snag very easily. They are super cute but the fact that they are very easily ruined make them only 2 star.
2.0,too small for adults.
2.0,Paint chipped off frame. You get what you paid for. :(
2.0,The bottles are okay but know that you will only get two. It is at the very end of the description but it's easy to miss.
2.0,"The right button is not pronounced and difficult to find.  Not only is it hard to set, I could only set the 1st alarm and it didn't work."
2.0,To hard to put on an take off
2.0,It is very cute set I got it for my 11-year-old daughter for her birthday however the Krystle on the chain came in broken
2.0,They r pretty but are not true to size! Hate that I have to send them back!
2.0,Only lasted my 6th grader 2 months before ripping and having to throw away.
2.0,to small for nose
2.0,"while the jewerly is beautiful, the bracelet is an ugly gray and takes away from the look. also the pieces are so heavy they end up under your wrist so all you see is the ugly grey bracelet.  i went to a craft store and completely redid it."
2.0,It’s cute but very thin and somewhat scratchy.
2.0,Quality and fit aren't great. For the price the top is fine
2.0,I have ordered this in two sizes. Both have to be returned. This is not for those of us who have hips and a behind. Extremely low cut.
2.0,It’s an ok jacket.  Not sure it’s worth the price.
2.0,It’s beautiful and the fabric is nice but it was a bit bigger than i anticipated
2.0,"Design flaw , they dig into the back of the ear"
2.0,Pocket hanging. Not sewn to sweatshirt.
2.0,Beautiful but is way too heavy.  I put them on for only a min and it felt like they were going to tear my ears open
2.0,"These are super cute but the straps come off very easily on every one I’ve used so far, 1 even came with straps. It’s hard to keep a mask on your face without straps."
2.0,not in love with it.....in order for it to be worn as the picture shows a person would have to have no hips whatsoever....skirt cut way too straight...please use realistic body types and not Twiggy's
2.0,"Will not fit standard credit cards, photos and business cards. No change compartment. While pleasant to look at not very practical. Maybe for a younger child."
2.0,"Most of these either immediately don't work or burn out within minutes. The ones that do work, through, bring great joy to my kids!"
2.0,"The bands are not durable. This is my second replacement band. If I have to get another replacement band, the cost of replacement bands will be close to the original cost of the watch. I would pay a little more in the initial cost if the band was a little more durable. I believe a little thicker band would be more durable."
2.0,"Although it's actually some sort of cheap metal, this thing actually looks plastic. The paint on it is super sparkly and has no depth. It's certainly not even worth what they're charging. But if you're fine with cheap costume jewelry, it's not a terrible necklace."
2.0,"Look like similar ones that we bought a few years back, but these are much thinner and not as absorbent."
2.0,Unfortunately the second day I was wearing them they broke.
2.0,"I ordered an XL, which is a size up for me, and it was tight.  I returned it."
2.0,Not that great...wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"The good:<br />It holds everything I would want to hold in my wallet.  No way the cards will fall out.  The leather appears to be real and it's a good concept.<br /><br />The bad:<br />This thing is very large. It does not fit in your back pocket.  I am a big man with large pockets on my jeans, however it sticks out of my back pocket nearly 3&#34; meaning that it's not at all secure from pick pockets as well as I found that it gets hooked on the car seat or anything you sit on and for the first day or so when I had it in my back pocket, it fell out three times.  I now carry it in my front pocket which is slightly uncomfortable because it barely fits there and it looks bulky.<br /><br />The zippers are not a great quality.  I have only had this wallet for a week and one of the zippers has already jammed.  I was able to free it again, but the zipper has a kink in it now so I can not open it all the way.<br /><br />The construction is not great.  Again, only having this wallet for a week, some of the threading is already coming out.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I would not purchase this wallet again.  After a week, I am looking for a replacement.  My wife has said that she will use it as she doesn't mind the size as it will fit fine in her purse.<br /><br />***Update<br />The same day that I submitted the review above, the company who sells this wallet, S Zone contacted me expressing their apology for the defective product.  They offered a full refund or a replacement for the wallet and gave me the impression that they care very much about the quality of their products and the customers they serve.  I would gladly purchase another product from S Zone.  I am keeping my rating of this wallet the same as it is honest with what I had received, but I would rate S Zone with 5 stars!<br /><br />***Final Update<br />I received the replacement wallet and it is a very nice wallet. Even the packaging was obviously intended to impress.  Great Job S Zone!"
2.0,"Color Fades to white in the armpit area after one wash, rest of shirt stays OK"
2.0,"I got a small, I am 5'2&#34; and 125lbs. The pants were a great length but too small in the thighs and waist. very cute, nice material. Shipping took over a month when it was supposed to be prime 2 days. returned them after I finally got them"
2.0,I think you have to be on the super skinny size to wear it as well. Didn’t look good on me and not quite the attention to detail that I had hoped for
2.0,The watch looks great. There are no marks on the watch to tell you how to set it and the alarm. You have to keep the very non descriptive instructions and figure it out. I'm stuck in military time and cannot get out. Thinking I'll send them back and find something a bit more simple to set.
2.0,Had a few bubbles in cast
2.0,"Bought these for my son. He said they were kind of itchy, and warm."
2.0,These sunglasses don’t feel like they would do much for protection from the sun.<br />They are oversized as stated.<br />They are NOT mirrored as stated. As you can tell - you can see right through them.<br />They feel very 80s to me.<br />I wouldn’t wear these for anything but with a costume.<br />They feel cheap like something from a gas station.<br />One of the sides doesn’t stay open and is floppy.<br />Maybe I’ll have an 80s theme party I can use these for!
2.0,Small tight on my face
2.0,Not size I ordered and is a lot smaller then pictured
2.0,"It's pretty, but it arrived tarnished on one side. Too bad. It's a pretty bracelet and I would have liked to get all the colors. But for the price I'd expect it to at least get to me in good condition."
2.0,It’s very cute.  But it’s just too big.  This was for my friend’s daughter who is turning 1.  It looked too big so I put it on my 4 year old to see and this is how it looked.  Although I couldn’t snap the closure at the bottom of the shirt.  I guess it’s just too wide.  It was cute but I had to return it.  Sorry.
2.0,"Very cheaply made, not worth the amount I paid, very light as well... definitely not very good for winter in Minnesota...I ordered 2 sizes bigger then what I normally wear and it was still a little to small"
2.0,I think this might run small. It barely covers my butt and just looks odd covering half of my body
2.0,This cheap screen printing will wear off very quickly after a few washes. Wished it was dyed and not screen printed.
2.0,"Outfit was ok, but could be better, I felt the skirt was to long and shirt was to short , I'm a XXL and felt the outfit was not made for a full figured person with big bust and curvy, maybe size up or make the product better."
2.0,Thought it would be for swingy.
2.0,It fits a child better than an adult.
2.0,"Love them but have to send back... baloney process for an inexpensive item that doesn't use enough, or any glue to hold on to logo."
2.0,"Nice design, good fit, but as with prior review, fades very fast, even when turned inside out in the wash."
2.0,This hoodie runs small. Bought it for my son de his 7th birthday so I got the size 7 and it was too small and that's the size he is currently in for everything else. Otherwise nice fabric and quality.
2.0,"I’m usually a pretty standard XL & although I could get the dress on, she was way too tight & not meant for large chested women.  This material tends to show every lump & bump so just size up & be aware of that!"
2.0,Returned.  Two different colors.
2.0,Love the look. Wasn't aware that it was a snap band (not sure if it's stated and my mind didn't register it) Snap gets caught and watch falls off.
2.0,the color was too far off.
2.0,"I ordered 3 of the same dress in different colors. 2 of the colors I loved, but the purple dress was different from the others. Instead of the ruffle being sewn on with thread (like the other 2), it had an elastic band at the hem of the ruffle. This made the dress cling to my thighs. Unfortunately, I do not have the body of a movie star, and the dress cupped my backend, making it appear more prominent, almost mermaid like - instead of covering my &#34;body issues&#34; and freely flowing like the description said. I was really excited about this dress, but was disappointed when I realized the hem was sewn with the elastic."
2.0,The band looks great. The jewels got tangled in my hair and almost ripped it out.
2.0,Oddd shaped
2.0,As stated in other reviews the bottoms are much smaller than the top. I am a size 16 1x and I ordered a 3x the bottoms fit but the top was to big. It would be great for a pregnant women.
2.0,"Pretty disappointed overall. They are supposed to be tight (it's in the title!) but I am 5'6&#34;, 140lbs, and always wear a medium in everything. These are too large, very loose and the colors are much lighter than the picture. Also, they get looser the longer you have them on."
2.0,This would be a very nice cape instead of making the bigger sizes extremely long they should make it the size to fit around you. I did not order the bigger size for length I wanted it to fit around me to cover me. So if you want that you won't get it from this cape.
2.0,Order size larger and still to small.
2.0,Very small pearl and the silver edging sticks out. Not my style
2.0,It’s good for a baby or a toddler
2.0,The hat is nice and is pretty snug as I ordered the s/m. I would leave a better review if the headliner was not missing in the shipment. I sent a message to the seller but did not get a response.
2.0,I don't like the buttons and I'm always accidentally touching them when I bend my wrist
2.0,Wire came right off after one use
2.0,"I understand it's not meant to be figure forming which was part of what I liked about it but does not fit at all like the pictures, more like a potato bag.  😕"
2.0,"I use the bag mostly for light duty gym use, the bag itself is pretty good, but the plastic parts are slowing breaking. For example, the strap broke within 2 months and now the bag is a hand bag, buyer beware, and would recommend seller change the plastic to metal for durability."
2.0,"We bought this for my husband. He wears a 7 1/8 hat. He could not even get this hat on. Otherwise, it looks like a nice product.<br /><br />Update: Work Wear Savings, the company through which the hat was purchased, sent me a return label the same day I called to say the hat was too small. They would send me a large hat when the other had arrived at their returns dept. After over 2 weeks, I had not had any email update. I called the company, learned they had received the returned hat, but that a large hat would not be available until July 14. My complaint: Why did they or Amazon not notify me by email? I do not feel I've gotten good customer service."
2.0,Poor quality. After using it 1 week in Mexico need to throw it away.
2.0,"Yes, the watch looks incredible. If you are the kind of person that is okay with taking your watch off when you shower or go swimming then this watch is great.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I tend to lose my things when I take them off, so I wear my watches 24/7. This watch got fogged up on the inside just from a hot shower."
2.0,Though I like the bag it doesn't look anything like its pictured!
2.0,The fabric is quite strange and the fit is off as well- I would not recommend this  item-- dlp
2.0,"Very difficult to put on, and not comfortable at all. I bought them because I thought they would be easier to put on and off at the airport on a recent trip.  I left them at home and wore sandals instead."
2.0,"The jeans came failing without buttons or border, do not buy the fabric is a shoe not Jens and are not responsible for poor quality and failures, NOT THE MODEL AND COLOR ONE SEE IN THE PHOTO"
2.0,The bar is obnoxious
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Was quite disappointed when it arrived. Its very thin and it's made out of costume spandex material . Wanted to return but my boyfriend threw away return packing . Money wasted!!
2.0,"XS fits PXS slightly snug. Really wanted to love this dress --ordered 3 but returned them all! The problem with these dresses is that they are very unflattering if you are thin but chesty.  Your chest will push out the front of the dress and make your whole body look as thick as your chest. I found a much more flattering fit in [[ASIN:B016WQ02SK Billabong Junior's Same Dance Knit Fit and Flare Dress, Off Black, Small]]"
2.0,"I have two invictas. They are of normal quality. I was not planning on buying another because I am trying to upgrade my collection. However, I had been looking for this particular color combination and style and could only find it in this watch. I took a chance. I returned the watch because it is really cheaply made. It is light and shiny and looks like something you'd get at Wal-Mart for under $10. The real reason it got returned is because the bezel wiggles so much it feels like it's gonna fall off. It will rotate by barely rubbing against your pants."
2.0,These can on time but unfortunately one of the earring post is so bent that I can't wear it so sad otherwise very cool product
2.0,"Wanted to use these for a cosplay of Launda from Critical Role. They're cute but hard to put on and mine came in bent or cracked. If you get a good pair im sure they're fantastic, I just got unlucky."
2.0,"Really wasn't impressed with the quality nor the width of this. Was too square and short and the nope was faded, over stretched, and just felt very cheap. Just felt crunchy and rough. He seems to like it but i personally didn't."
2.0,The dog came off 1st day. The little piece of round piece holding the dog on the heart fell off and I almost lost the dog.<br />I was gifting this to my dog walker so she’d have a key to my house.<br />I found a way to make it work but I shouldn’t have needed to do that.<br />It’s cute though
2.0,The arm holes do not stretch so if you have bigger arms it won’t fit! Also wish i could chose a top size and a bottom size.
2.0,I returned this because it was way too small.
2.0,"Ordered this jersey in Large, my default size for cycling jerseys.  Fit was rated 80% as expected so I thought that a safe choice.  Upon arrival my jersey was marked L but was ridiculously tight, instead fitting my tiny 4'11"" spouse across the shoulders.  Mis-labeled at the factory perhaps ?  So do I exchange it for XL or maybe XXL is needed ?  No, returning it.  Such are the pitfalls of ordering cycling clothing online.<br /><br />I like the light weight of this jersey which would be good for summer riding, the quality looked good.  One thing I didn't notice when ordering, the jersey says ""Super Mee"" on the back.  Depending upon your fitness level, that could have other riders snickering as they pass you on the climbs."
2.0,"Granted my wife has had this for over a year now but half the ""crystal"" has lost it's color.  She loves this bracelet but if this is what happens after a year why bother..."
2.0,"It's a nice band...but very very small. Only fit on the first hole for me, which made it very uncomfortable. Off to the Amazon trash, it goes."
2.0,"I absolutely loved this purse and rec'd compliments from everyone who saw it.  But this morning (2 days after my 30 day return date) - the strap broke while wearing it.  It is not fixable.  I tried to find a link to contact the seller, but it I could not."
2.0,I purchased these based on positive reviews. I am 97 lbs and 5 ft 2 inches. These were way too large and are vanity sized. Back to Amazon they go.
2.0,Awkward fit. Spacious some places. Way to tight others. Button spaces are too far apart. Even if it fit you would want an undershirt as it is very slinky.  If it fit I would have kept to fill an odd wardrobe need but it was about the cheapest shirt I have ever seen. I sent it back.
2.0,"I bought a different pattern last year and came back for a new in this year, the fabric was much much thinner. They are not the same fit."
2.0,"This bag is VERY small.  Do not be deceived by the pics.  It can barely hold a smart phone and your car keys.  In fact some smart phones might even be too big for this bag, eg. Galaxy Note.  If you're just looking to throw in your lipstick and car keys it'll work, but not much else.  Would have returned it but came all the way from China. Not worth the hassle."
2.0,"When I received the Tee, I thought it wasn't a genuine Tommy Bahama shirt.  The fabric isn't as soft like they normally are and the color was dingy.  I have purchased many tees from the Tommy shop and they are usually very soft feeling.  The reason I purchased this one online is because the shop was out of them in the size I needed.  I took the received shirt to the Tommy Bahama store and the sales associate said that sometimes the quality is not as good when purchased through Amazon.  The shirt was a gift and I didn't have time to return it, but the recipient also noticed the difference."
2.0,nice look but rather heavy and clip backs pinch!  Probably would not recommend for most and would not purchase again.
2.0,"I had bought these in their “grey” option previously and loved them. Most recently I ordered them in black and brown- very disappointed. The fabric in both pairs was far less quality. Felt like a cheap Rayon, looked ridiculously low quality when I put the pairs on. I had hoped these would be like the other color I had previously ordered which were a quality heavy material that looked very chic."
2.0,"The dress fit perfectly, but the sweater was somewhat larger than expected.  Overall, cute dress, but thin fabric."
2.0,Wasn’t the color pictured and the buttons fell off right after I took the tag off.
2.0,"Do not buy these sunglasses. They fall apart within weeks! I have purchased 3 pairs so far snd they all broke within the first 3 weeks of wearing, pretty much in the same spot on the glasses! I loved the way they looked and had strangers on the street comment how pretty they are but this company ReaLY and I mean REALLY need to add some springs to them and make with a much better grade of plastic as they as very cheaply made and WILL fall apart. Customer service was wondeful."
2.0,I got 4  necklaces for each one of my kids so they will always remember mom is going to still be there by their sides when I soon will be crossing the rainbow bridge. It was very devastating when my youngest son put hus necklace on and it was already broken and he's the one that will wear it everyday he's only 10 years old and I'm the only parent that my kids have so I have been trying to do things and have many conversations with them so hopefully when the time comes it won't be so overwhelming and they can get back to their lives easier and quicker and always remember how much they are truly loved.  This necklace is absolutely great it just needs to be made better so it doesn't break easily. Thank you
2.0,The first pair I wore about 4 times and the frames cracked and the lense fell out. I guess I thought I was buying a better quality.
2.0,I couldn't find a bigger size and it was cut on the small side so did not fit my wife
2.0,Won’t  stay tight on my hat
2.0,"Overall the hat is well made and attractive and warm, however I ordered large for my husband and the hat is way too small.  In fact, it barely fits my head."
2.0,"So you get 50, but they are all one of six randomly chosen designs. Unfortunately I received the jaundiced Santa. There are 50 of them as promised. I don’t know why Santa has a yellow mustache. Overall not very cute, much better out there."
2.0,"I opted for this item over one of the many package deals that included the gloves,  cigarette holder and headband because I'd never used those 'extras' again after the Gatsby themed event but a girl should own opera gloves. They do rest beyond the elbow and fit snugly on the fingers BUT after one use of only a couple of hours the threading along the edge of the gloves are loose. I may get one or two more wears then I'll have to look at another pair of significantly higher quality.  For 7.99 one can't expect too much."
2.0,The lenses just randomly pop out.
2.0,"Band was to small, Very difficult to get  on. So I returned the watch and was only given 1/2 purchase price ."
2.0,Like it but color was way off from picture more if a gold...
2.0,"More than a minute fast daily. Dark speck on inside of crystal. Looked great with the features I sought, but poor quality even for this price."
2.0,Way too short. Should be shown on a model. My daughter is a size 0 and very petite. This was ridiculously small
2.0,Its beautiful and i was so happy when i unbox it it was beautiful and perfect till a stone fell out and i try to put it back in and the stone broke i want this ring but i dont want to buy it again its the perfect look i want and I'm so sad it fell out<br />I would of given this 10 stars if it was perfect
2.0,Mask is not the same as advertised.  Teeth and Nose not even same.  Teeth in advertise has pointed/ vampire teeth and nose is totally different
2.0,"The dress fit, but the wrap-around part in the front kept slipping under the bra-line. Would return, but I already wore it once."
2.0,It’s not red. It’s coral. Very disappointed.
2.0,"While I really like the dress style, I found the skirt narrowing at the bottom to be a bit too much for my comfort.  I'll be returning the dress because I don't like the way it clings to my thighs (especially in the knee area) at the bottom of the dress.  I also had some problems with the cowl fitting properly and staying in place (wanted to ride up).  The dress may work fine for another person but it just wasn't right for me."
2.0,"The first time I purchased these for my daughter, we loved them, specifically because they had an inner pocket and earloops, which for some reason is hard to find. I purchased them again expecting the same, and the product was different the second time with no inner pocket, so I had to return them unfortunately."
2.0,very cheap looking. sent back.
2.0,"The photo makes it look like it will be a pale pink, black and white scarf. What actually came was a light beige, black and white scarf. It's not as cute as it is in the photo. The colors are dull. The fabric and size was nice, but the coloring is not going to work for the outfit I purchased it to go with, So I plan to return it."
2.0,Had to return this item. It would have been great but the material was bathing suit material. Kinda strange but if you are okay w that then the fit is great otherwise.
2.0,It’s like a huge piece of frayed fabric
2.0,It's a crop tank not nearly has long in the picture. The bust is super low. If I wear it with a bra it's a bra I'm okay with showing. It's not remotely as cute or flattering in the picture.
2.0,Not what I expected. They fit weird around the waist almost  like the top wants to roll down. The material that the jeans are made of is thick and bulky and it doesn’t have any belt loops.
2.0,Be cool if you live in Arizona and you got free sand everywhere<br />But really overpriced compared to other top dollar vests that come with 20 lbs of steel<br />You can get a bulletproof vest for this much
2.0,Wasn't surgical steel... silver coating peeling from barbell. Scared they'll turn my skin green :/
2.0,"Every time I washed them during my 500 mile journey on the Camino de Santiago, they shrunk. The tighter they were, the more blisters I got on the sides of my feet (pinky toes). Yes they kept dry and not too warm, but I could have done without the shrinkage."
2.0,I made sure to the measurements were accurate on the size guide. But when the dress came it was just down right too small. Besides it being too small it was pretty and the quality was ok considering the price but it just didn’t work.
2.0,This dress arrived very wrinkled the fabric was very thin.  I sent back I knew it wasn’t going to work for me.
2.0,Great while they lasted a few months
2.0,"Seems like a lot of money for a small, wrinkled up piece of baby clothing. It was for a baby shower so of course I don’t know how it fits."
2.0,This dress was too short.  I'm 5'7&#34; and it was too far off the ground with flats.
2.0,Way too short. But it’s a cute dress
2.0,Xs fits like a womens medium!!!!!! I ordered i. Black and white and both are giant
2.0,"It was definitely shorter than most ""Tunic"" tops. I will wear it with jeans but not with leggings like I do my other tunic tops. Disappointed a bit."
2.0,"This isn’t nearly the shade of lavender that was pictured and ordered. It is more a silver with a tinge of pale, pale lavender."
2.0,"Its kind of Loose, at least for Me as I have small shoulders. But my biggest Disappointed is that I believe this item is USED! Why? Coz it doesnt smell NEW! If anything it has a weird Odor to it. Its almost as tho Someone returned this Item or rather you guys USED it yourselves, and without washing It recycled it by giving it to a Client. Listen I KNOW what new item smells like, I know what never been Worn smells and This item you gave me has been Worn. But other than that its actually Flowy which I Love. I just dont like paying 23 dollars! For somebody's else's second hand clothing. I payed for a New Item give me the same Courtesy. Thank you very Much<br /><br />Update: Okay After Cooling off for a Couple of days lol I finally can Enjoy this Cardigan and upon closer look its actually Very Nice and now I love it :) But still..."
2.0,runs way smaller than listed measurement
2.0,"First off, when I picked it out out of the box, the fringe attached to the zipper fell right off. I wasn't too bothered by it, at least the bag was ok. Then, when I actually went outside with it, the zipper got caught on the fabric inside and was so impossible to fix that the zipper broke. It's nice if you want to want a disposable purse I guess."
2.0,I disliked the fact that the cording broke and I have a baggie of amber beads in my jewelry box now instead of a bracelet that I can wear.
2.0,It keeps falling off. I give up.  I have found it once in my house on the floor and try again.  No matter how much I tighten it even with needle nose pliers it keeps coming off.
2.0,"Cute, but not for newborns, these are huge on my 6 week old (and she has the average size head of a newborn) so description is misleading"
2.0,Does not smooth out when wearing and clingy.
2.0,Initially felt it was a good but then later on it just gave me headache and felt the heaviness while wearing.
2.0,"They are too bulky to use...  They would be better designed if they were wider from side to side.  The space for the winkie (if you will) is about the size and shape of a chapstick tube...  pretty much useless for covering everything securely.  They are absorbent, though."
2.0,"MATERIAL VERY FLIMSY.  PICTURE LOOKS LIKE WHITE, WHITE MATERIAL BUT IT IS VERY SHEER AND COMES ACROSS NOT SO WHITE LOOKING.  I WOULDN'T PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. It is a cheap made product. The packaging was terrible. The boots were folded over on top of each other, they were in my mailbox, so wrinkled and creased I may not be able to wear them next week."
2.0,It’s not a cotton mask and material is too thin. I am not comfortable to let my daughter wear it outdoor.
2.0,I ordered a extra small and it was more like an large it is not true to size otherwise the material is very nice and colours really pop
2.0,color was great and the material very soft.  Problem was that while the shirt fit the neck was way too big- like it was stretched out.  Sadly had to return
2.0,So these are adorable and perfect except we got 2 different sizes and can’t get them back from my niece to trade. So disappointed but she loves them and won’t take them off.
2.0,I wanted to return this but time slipped away from me and I missed the deadline for sending it out. I love the color. Didn't know that it's open on both sides. There's only one spot on the side that has a stitch. Not what I was looking for at all. I wanted a cover up that I could throw on over my suit and run to the store or wherever after being in the pool etc.. I can't wear this one though because like I said it's open on both sides. Runs a bit big. Could have bought a size or two down.
2.0,Love the earrings but they broke the first time I wore them. Super disappointed because they are very pretty
2.0,Quality is like everything from China no good
2.0,The webbing is thin.  The buckle seems like it is made out of plastic.
2.0,"Way to small. So short it barely covers your butt, chest area so tight it completely flattens you out, but if I were to go up a size or two the waste would be to big. Not flattering at all. Very dissapointed that i will have to return this."
2.0,The dress is beautiful and looks just like picture. If you are smaller you will look great. It’s not for bigger women! Not true to size. Not really stretch material. I am size 16 US and ordered a XXl this for someone maybe12/14 closer to size 12. Will give to my mother who is a size 12 fits her perfectly for church.
2.0,"both side have come unglued might want to spend more to get something that will last longer then a day, very disappointed this was a Christmas gift for my son."
2.0,Not the material shown in the picture. Material is flimsy. Doesn't look like pic
2.0,"There were only six hats, not as many as shown in photo. But they are also pretty cheesy and cheap. Not worth what I paid! If I had been in a brick and mortar store, and seen them in person before buying, I would never have gotten them :-(  I sure feel they were not worth what I paid!"
2.0,This tie arrived in a small tie box but the gold stripe had a black streak running across the front of the tie.<br />Very disappointed as this was a Christmas gift.
2.0,The lace looks cheap and the color is peach.
2.0,Am getting this for my granddaughter for Christmas & it's not the size I wanted but I will have to keep it.
2.0,"Looking to combine it with hnos light gray shoes but the gray color is a bit greenish so it did not work, hence in fiwra is a good hat for ages 4 and up."
2.0,Thought I could get away with tights under this outfit but it will have to be leggings because it fits like a shirt.  I order the largest size they had but it looks nothing like the picture.
2.0,"well made, priced right, and arrived quickly but is beige (tan), absolutely, positively not cream nor off-white nor ivory nor antique"
2.0,Smaller than it looked. Not a true brown it is more of a maroon on the leather trim.
2.0,"The 3 shirts I got did not fully match the description and pictures posted for them.  I got the pink, purple and blue set.  The purple and blue are more grey with specks of purple or blue and the pink is neon pink, like it practically glows in the dark. The material is a little thin but that's no biggie for something that I'll be sweating in. Since its just workout clothes it's not that big of a deal, but still a disappointment."
2.0,"Looks beautiful, and it's a great price but I guess you get what you pay for. One of the little brown threads started unraveling after wearing it just once. I glued it down so from the outside appearance it looks okay, but I know that won't last long."
2.0,It is so cute but it's super short in the back! Seems like not made correctly
2.0,The case is nothing great to talk about
2.0,"Sent this bag back as it was too big for what I needed it for.  It was a prime item, but I had to pay almost $8 to return it which may be standard but really turned me off even more.  My overall feeling is....Meh"
2.0,"Honestly what do you expect for so cheap but really... the pendant is supposed to be real pewter, but it feels extremely cheap and had no marking to indicate material. Will not buy again."
2.0,"sleeves are too short, side slits too high, not soft even after washing with A LOT of fabric softener."
2.0,"Although these shoes are aesthetically pleasing, they have ZERO grip on the bottom. The soles are a hard plastic that slips on tile, wood floors, even concrete. I have slipped many times in these shoes, and no longer wear them."
2.0,"The hooks or glasses holder get too wide and do not hold glasses, they slip off"
2.0,Material is very cheap and doesn’t hang well.
2.0,Fabric is flimsy and bra has a hump along the top edge.
2.0,"The shirt is poorly made. I’ve attached a picture of the threads sticking out. The shirt looks much longer than it really is. I don’t have a long torso by any means so it must be short. I was super bummed. Looked super cute online, just not the greatest in person. 😒"
2.0,SMALL. barley fit my hands at all. I was so excited for these but I’m really disappointed. Not warm enough for snow.
2.0,"So I got these thinking it would be a dupe for the Lululemon Nulu Bra, but the straps are a little too long and not adjustable. Also the bra caps are visible with the lighter colors.<br /><br />I did like that the band is thick and wide, but with everything else considered, I rather pay for the lulu bra and call it a day."
2.0,"It comes off, it’s nothing like the ad shows"
2.0,I ordered an XL and the fit was more of a medium. It also didn't feel long enough. The tiger patch was more green than yellow.
2.0,"The over the mouth part is not really breathable, so it just pushes air out the top. The drawstring is too small for the clamp so it doesn’t even work. I have a big head and was hoping it would fit bc it says it’s stretchable but it doesn’t stretch that much.<br />It is warm though."
2.0,I ordered a xx-large just to be on the safe side and it was still tight and didn't fit my breast well at all. I am a medium in almost every thing I wear so I was surprised this didn't fit right.
2.0,I bought these socks as my feet pain and need arch support and when i read the description i was very impressed with the description and the photos but when i used it i find no arch support and disappointment with the product quality
2.0,The material is almost see through. Too thin and not as form fitting given the pictures shown.
2.0,Everything's fine but the lining and trim were yellow not orange. Comes across orange in the show. Wouldnt be a big deal if I didn't buy pants from somewhere else.
2.0,"I am SO disappointed with this dress. After I washed it, it stained! My daughter needs this dress tomorrow for her presentation and there is no way I could order a new one because if I do it will deliver on Monday or sometimes next week. So there is no time to get a new one. So disappointed..my goodness!!! The dress is nice and soft and it fits her perfectly but it stained after first washed! We probably have to go to Walmart today and find a new dress for her to wear tomorrow. What a waste!!😔😔😔"
2.0,"There was a terrible smell when I opened the bags, so I washed in gentle cycle and air dryed them, all ends freyed on all three bandanas."
2.0,"Beautiful and not see through. However, after second wear some peeling happened. It seems it won't survive first wash"
2.0,Dress is super cute but runs super small XL fits like a medium will be returning.
2.0,The top chronograph hand was off. It did not sit at the 12 o’clock position when reset. It sat a little off to the left
2.0,The sizes
2.0,It's nice and all but once you put this on your watch you can't really take this off unless you have a special tool or you take it to someone
2.0,"I ordered XL, usually wear large, they barely came to my wrists."
2.0,"In the short sleeve, this shirt fit perfectly, but in the long sleeve it's more than a size too big."
2.0,"Squeaky hinges. The ""glass lenses"" over a very short time wear. Becoming smudged, like. But it won't come off, even with a eye glass cloth. Same thing happened on all 5prs.<br />2 of the 5 in photo."
2.0,"Nice material, but it was too small. The wrist is super tiny, but I used the belt to cover the unzipped portion."
2.0,"At first, I loved it, 4 months later the watch stopped working. Since the watch doesn't have a seconds hand, I don't know if it's frozen or just broken. It has been a month now that the watch hasn't worked. :( You get what you pay for!"
2.0,Service was awesome.  Speedy shipment on the merchant A+<br /><br />Bought a 2XL usually wear XL fits like a US adult large.<br /><br />Shirt is okay quality but feels like wearing a nylon duffel bag.<br /><br />Honestly cannot recommend the product.
2.0,Disappointed in these jeans. Ran very small and had to return.
2.0,"The description said High Waisted these are more like low riders.  The fit ran a bit smaller than my usual 4's.  Length was ok,"
2.0,Band went along perfectly with the watch but it is not durable as this is maybe 2 weeks later and it has already ripped along the area where you secure the band to the watch face.
2.0,"Poor quality and doesn’t look like the picture very much at all. I got in on sale for $3 though, so can’t complain too much."
2.0,Reflection on the interior side of the glass is extreme!
2.0,"These are advertised as masks also. These are nice headbands but in no way do they qualify as a face mask. They wouldn’t stay up on your face, they do not cover what needs to be covered, and when you try to breath it’s absolutely impossible"
2.0,My son didn’t like them they looked like girl pants
2.0,Does not fit well for me.  I am 5'2'' 99 to 100 pound.  Material is very thick.
2.0,As one of the arms of my sunglasses came off and I still have the little card for the lifetime Guarantee<br />I wrote to Elite already 4 times through their website forms. Till now still no response.<br />I was pleased with the glasses but I wonder what their lifetime guarantee is worth. So far nothing<br />Willy Janssens<br />Las Vegas
2.0,"Although advertised as &#34;wide calf&#34; there was no way I could even get my foot in (because of my wide calves) so I ended up having to return them. If you have normal-thin calves, they look like they'd be very comfortable."
2.0,"Pretty color, pretty dress, but the picture is deceiving. Looks like it flows loosely from bust, but it was tight through the middle.  The large might fit, bot not sure."
2.0,Not worth for many and it is too small
2.0,Really ugly in person. It looks like a nightgown.
2.0,"Bought for a friend with average size head, said it was way too small fitting"
2.0,"Price does not equal quality.<br />Actually a cloth bag with very inexpensive handles...smells like plastic<br />Will return, if it was $10 I would keep it but $32.  NO Thanks"
2.0,"This is a beautiful band and fit like a dream but the quality of craftsmanship was not great. It had a screw come out after 3 days of wearing it and then when I put the screw back in correctly, it did not actually lock onto my gearfit correctly. Too bad because I really loved the look of it!"
2.0,"I normally wear an XL or 40D, but I went with the sellers recommendation and purchased a large.  Which, just by holding it up was never going to fit me.  I ended up giving it to a friend that is a small to medium in most things and it fits her fine"
2.0,"This dress is so gorgeous, but I wore it once and there is already a rip at the waist that I don’t think I can sew back. So disappointed because it is such an amazing dress."
2.0,"I was delighted to have my Tiki Bar delivered even before expected!  The only problem I had was the over head frond is crooked and not even.  The pre-drilled holes were not aligned properly and when I tried to re-drill new ones, the bamboo cracked.  This made the canopy slant and not making a stable Tiki Bar. I still love the product but since made in Vietnam I guess there is inspection process."
2.0,They're too small than l expected
2.0,This belt runs very small . I had to add another hole  but it’s right at the edge of the belt. I size up to make sure it would fit . But I think you might need to size up 3 times your size
2.0,This is a nice belt but it is much bigger and thicker than I had expected it to be. It's still normal width so it'll fit through normal belt loops but it's stiffer than what I'm used to and the buckle itself is a little wider so it kind of sticks out rather than laying flat.
2.0,I didn't like it didn't come with a red heart.
2.0,Runs bigger
2.0,These fit great and are super cute but they smell AWFUL. Like gasoline or chemicals. At first I thought it was just because they were new but they still stink months later and i had to move them to the basement thinking it would go away.. but they will be getting trashed instead.
2.0,Cute but had scratches
2.0,Pendant is very big. If u don't like don't buy. I give it away to someone who like it
2.0,Crooked and totally didn't sit straight on the face...not worth the price at all. I will be returning the product.
2.0,I had a baby few weeks ago so have to sleep now with light in my room unfortunately I like to sleep in dark otherwise I won't be able to sleep. So I decided to buy a sleep mask ..this one is too light u can still have the light in your eyes furthermore in less than one week the mask doesn't stay in place you always have to fix it because it's loose already.
2.0,"The shoe does have a good sole for going outside for a short while, otherwise it looks a little on the cheap side. They are way too small even though I ordered a size larger than normal for my husband. I had to send them back."
2.0,The size is terribly off.  Not true to size not even close! But its cute.
2.0,Why in the world would anyone charge $90 for a onesie?! That’s just utter nonsense. I don’t know what makes you think that a pair of carebear like pajamas are worth $90 but you all are ridiculous. I’ll spend money too no problem but this is joke.
2.0,"Quality was probably fine but very bad sizing.. I wear 14/16 women’s, bought xxl but they can’t even begin to fit??!!!"
2.0,"This would have been a cute jacket but it was poorly stitched together. One seam on one sleeve which was clearly visible was sewn using green thread, it was very tacky and noticeable. It made the jacket very ugly, I sent it back and they did issue me a full refund. Had it not been for the poor stitching this would have made a cute jacket."
2.0,My son really likes this watch.  Unfortunately we've already bought him 2 of them and the band has broke on both of them.  My son is 11 so I had hoped they were more kid proof since it's a kid watch but I guess not. I suppose it would be better for less active kids?
2.0,"I like most the quality of the product, but I was trying to purchase a shoe strecher for men's shoes. Shoe strecher is of good quality,but it can't perform the work on a man's shoe."
2.0,This dress is so thin - I've decided to make it a bedtime dress.
2.0,wouldnt stay in my ear and when i had it bent to fit my ear -my ear got sore.
2.0,"not worth buying -- cheap, fall out of shirt"
2.0,Sadly it runs small and as a Christmas Eve gift of matching pajamas for my kids turned out to be a huge disappointment for my child who couldn’t wear hers because they are just way too small.
2.0,Very cheap material. It's not as flowy as I would have liked it to be. I even ordered a size bigger and it still showed all of my midriff.
2.0,Bottom is elastic and cinched. Not as pictured. I am returning it
2.0,The clash on side and zipper defective at taking out of box.
2.0,"Not as advertised. Socks are made for mans sized foot.  Thin quality & short in length; they are not Knee hi's.  Maybe mid calf at best. After I washed, blue color sock was stretched out badly in toe area after washing and I don't recommend buying these socks."
2.0,"The material was nice, but just a little frumpy for my liking."
2.0,"The pants are pretty loose so I have to tie the waist belt tight to keep them up. There are loose threads and the fabric is very, very thin."
2.0,"I’m 5’10”, and this tunic is much too short to be worn to work with leggings, which is what I intended."
2.0,Purchased expecting a fully lined shirt I could wear as a light jacket at work.  It’s not fully lined.  Just a shirt.
2.0,These are bigger than I expected.  I rarely wear them.
2.0,"Disappointed! For the price I paid, this purse kind of sucks. The zippers are always getting stuck. Made cheaply!! I do NOT recommend buying this piece of trash!<br />I went to a local major department store and bought a similar purse, and made with quality materials, for only $3.00 more."
2.0,"If you’re looking for something to cover you but care nothing for aesthetics or comfortable fabric, this dress is for you. Someone forgot to close the left pocket so i couldn’t even put my hand in it. Just not a frumpy frock. Bet it fades quickly too. If you’re looking for a cute dress, keep looking, this is not the dress for you."
2.0,"Uncomfortable, no support, and cheap"
2.0,"I saw the photo and thought what a great top and in so many great colors.I went to ad the top to my basket but then I saw the shipping fee. OH MY!!!!  That is just ridiculous to charge that much, I will not be buying this top!"
2.0,Very cute but white strand broke first time put on
2.0,"I purchsed my normal 2x size however shirt was to tight around chest im a 40D material was soft but had no nice flow like advertised you can tell its a Cheaper material used,  there was also no tags on shirt showing brand or size, so i don't even know if they shipped right size to me. I wouldn't waste your money."
2.0,Padding is strange. Shows through clothing. Sizing runs big.
2.0,"I wore this dress for a few hours before it ripped open under my arm when I bent over, almost exposing my boob.... Great story... Terrible dress.  Save your money and buy something with high quality fabric and stitching!"
2.0,"Based on their sizing I should have easily fit, but these tights are really small!"
2.0,It’s not all one piece like the picture shows. It’s separated and highlights your stomach.
2.0,"color is baby pink. ugly baby pink, does not look like picture"
2.0,"I wanted to love this so much, but I was very disappointed. It's a super cute design (which is the only reason it gets 2 stars), but the faux fur fabric was super rough and scratchy. Also, I was expecting the inside to be lined with fur, but it was a synthetic material that made a lot of noise whenever I moved. It wasn't very comfortable at all, I had to return it."
2.0,Did not like these tank tops at all.. Not what I expected.. Rolled up on me.. Too short for me..
2.0,These break very easily - clip is hard to push in for kids. Do not recommend.
2.0,The bag is bulky and It barely fits my toothbrush. :(
2.0,"Pretty cheap looking,  but you get what you pay for lol"
2.0,I was confused between CT and CTW. I guess my expectation was exceeding.
2.0,"Fabric was nice, but was too small and returned it."
2.0,"Not as cute in person as in the picture. Looks cheap, not chic and like a dress you would just wear around the house"
2.0,Runs very small.  Also very thin material and 100% cotton -- it will shrink when washed.
2.0,2 out of 4 were good.  I bought these as a gift.  The black and pink were great.  The lavender is not lavender its a dark purple.  The white one has a broken snap. At least I have 3 usable ones and will have to try to fix the white one since it came broken.
2.0,broke easy be carful
2.0,Heart charm fell off
2.0,"IMO This sweater was cheaply made, the texture of the material was scratchy and the sweater emitted in odd odor."
2.0,I was totally surprised by the quality of this dress after reading the reviews. I thought it was cheaply constructed. It was a wrinkled mess when it was received so I assume it would wash & dry with wrinkles.
2.0,Love the shoe...it's beautiful and well made but the sizing is waaaaay off.  I usually wear an 8 and either 38 or 39.  I have previously purchased Summit styles in a 38 so that's what I ordered in this one.  Not even close to fitting.  I had a friend who wears a size 6.5 try them on and they were too small for her.  Very disappointing.  I contacted the seller about returning and ordering another size but they were unable to confirm whether this pair was miss-marked or if this style just runs really small.  I gave them 2 stars because if they are beautiful shoes...but not much good if you can't figure out what size to wear!  Therefore I cannot recommend these shoes.
2.0,Defective! Pink star on front of hat was sewed on crooked!
2.0,The chain changed colors on the first day of me wearing it.
2.0,"I ordered a size up from my normal size hoping that it would fit because I usually like to try things on first. It feels like a cheaper made shirt and it is pretty short. I am 5’7 or so and I usually don’t have a huge issue with the length of my shirts. I didn’t like the length on this one though. I’ll still wear it, but probably tucked in or tied up."
2.0,"Loved the design of this item. However, I had to throw it away as the length of the item was too short. Of course, the length was as advertised, so I cannot really complain. I would highly recommend you go for the ""C473 Gold Collar Bar"" also available on Amazon."
2.0,140lbs 5’4” I ordered a small & it was super tight. I couldn’t even zip it all the way up. Order a size up! Also you cannot wear a bra with this dress
2.0,Belt says 42 but is smaller then my other belt which says 42
2.0,"I don't care the fabric, it fits weird and it's shiny. I guess I was hoping for cotton look. I sleep in it!"
2.0,I ordered the black & tan leopard print & the gray leopard print. They were advertised as a cotton poly blend but they're 95% polyester 5% spandex. Not a super flattering fit & a lot of loose threads. The gray leopard print had an almost neon yellow in it. Really ugly. The black & tan was not bad but I can't do the material. Sending both back.
2.0,It’s a nice product but too big for my neck. Not really a choker necklace then…. Bummer! I plan to return.
2.0,"If I had to do again, then I would have spent more on a better spike wrench. This barely did the job and is only good for one or two uses."
2.0,"does not fit on band , will return<br />When I went to Kohns , they could not process return without the symbol"
2.0,dont look the same
2.0,"Size: I normally wear a size 12 pants, and ordered a size Large as usual.  These pants are very large, very loose, with a very high waist - several inches above my belly button.  XL maybe?<br />Lenght: I normally wear 34-35"" inseam and these size Large pants drag several inches on the floor.  I'd say 37"" inseam at least.<br />Color: Maybe I'm being too picky about the color.  I ordered pink pants to celebrate being clean of breast cancer.  But these aren't as pink as shown in the photos, they are more light red orange - coral color (see photo).<br /><br />Other than that, they seem to be well made and of a good material.  Just for a giant. Who loves coral."
2.0,"I have purchased several of these tummy control workout tights from this company; however, this pair seems to run small. The other 2X pants I purchased were true to size. Perhaps this color is smaller because of color. Not sure of the difference but overall the other pants were really comfortable."
2.0,I like this item the only problem is the 2 law come out so easy
2.0,"This came up way too night around my neck to be comfortable. It’s a lovely design and material, hence the 2 stars. But too uncomfortable for yoga and not nearly enough support for running/cross training. Might work just as a cute sporty top if that’s your style."
2.0,"I should have believed all of the previous reviews. these are NOT the same quality of the tanks purchased previously on QVS. They're fine, just lower quality and more stretch."
2.0,I was hoping these would be awesome but they are not. Do hard to use and too big.
2.0,Disappointed in the packaging.  Accessories did not come as displayed in picture.  They were all thrown together in a plastic bag.
2.0,One of the zippers don't work and the bag is stiff so it's hard to open it up and put items in it.
2.0,Look & color is fine but details say 10&#34; wide x 8&#34; high -- actual size is 8&#34; wide x 6&#34; high so too small for every day use.  Disappointed as I would have not purchased if actual dims were stated.
2.0,I bought these for my sister and the rings were so huge in diameter it wouldn't fit in any piercing either if us had. Had to return.
2.0,"Had to return as the fabric was super thin, clingy, and just not yet quality I wanted. I have two similar dresses I purchased off of Amazon probably 7 years ago and they are made so much better.  I still wear them and am sad the manufacturer no longer carries them.  This dress..just did not meet expectations."
2.0,Looked great until I washed it once on all the settings they recommended and it still scraped all the paint off and now its unwearable
2.0,"I was very disappointed with this watch.  It is extremely heavy and bulky.  I just don't see how it is practical or functional.  I work with my hands and would find this very annoying.  As far as the appearance goes, it is also hard to see the digital display and does not really look like it does in the picture.  I think the backlight is on in the picture.  I would not recommend this, especially for the price.  Way over done and impractical, will be sending this back"
2.0,Would be great if I had zero body fat and no cellulite. Maybe I would had liked a different color other than white but this was not flattering at all. It wasn’t that the nightgown was tight; it’s too clingy. The material showed off more stuff than I ever knew I had.<br /><br />2 stars as the material was soft and cool but this is definitely not for the bigger girls. At least not in white/cream.
2.0,THE PICTUE SHOWS THE EAR RINGS TO BE MUCH LARGER WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN
2.0,I agree with the reviews that a correct fitting is difficult given the differences is measuring techniques. I ordered XL but they were only a 38 waist.
2.0,"Had a seam that went across my breasts. Probably supposed to be just under, but it was high. Also, the fabric was thin. Sending it back."
2.0,Poorly made.  One of the front straps on the crisscross was sewn on all twisted around.  I fixed it myself and now I like it.
2.0,The edges of the belt fray off very easily because the loop for the end of the belt it too small. It's ok but I'd never buy it again.
2.0,Had tears on seams and a XXL is more like a large if that.
2.0,"Well made for the price but definitely NOT the size they claim. Might fit if you're 5ft or less and have a waist probably 40in or smaller. If I hadn't had my event scheduled for two days after this arrived I would have returned it. As is, had to drop another 150$ to get the dang thing altered in time so now I CAN'T return, which is more than a little annoying. Like I said, it is a well made piece (though the eyes take some practice - theyre spaced pretty far apart) just be prepared for it to run REALLY small."
2.0,"The problem with this key is that there are too many different remotes. Even though I chose the correct key, the chip was easy programmable, but the actual remote programming failed. As we found out from Mitsubishi, the FCC number of the FOB has to match the FCC number of the car! Nothing mentioned about that in the item description."
2.0,It's adorable but runs small
2.0,Too much like a daily on your head.
2.0,"not as good as it looks , it looks much rich in the post than what it actually is ."
2.0,"Good looks, bad quality, broke within 2 days of purchasing"
2.0,The chain is rusted and has black spots all over it.
2.0,Too big around the chest but tight at the bottom. I usually wear a large for comfort but this shirt is not comfortable at all.
2.0,Poor quality fabric and elastic around waistband.  I was hoping for a nicer yoga pant; wouldn't buy these again.
2.0,Fell apart just outside the return window
2.0,The material was really great but the fitting was off. I’m more pear shaped so the top was slightly large and the bottoms were way to small. Overall though if you have a more proportional shape this suit may work better for you. Quality was good and it arrived just as pictured.
2.0,Material was thinner than expected
2.0,Super cute socks but the don't stay up.
2.0,"I want to like this. But the straps are terrible with no support at all, might as well be strapless."
2.0,"Glasses only seem to last about 10 wears, then the hinges break.  They are inexpensive and may be useful for emergency eyewear use."
2.0,The fabric in this skirt reflects the cost. It’s scratchy. The seams aren’t smooth and the waistband has thread raveling. I do not recommend this skirt.
2.0,"These shoes where super cute, but they stink like mildew. I've tried to get the smell out but haven't had any luck. Very dissatisfied especially with how long they took to ship then end up being unusable"
2.0,Lasted about a week before the zipper broke.
2.0,"I like everything about it except the size.  I ordered a medium and received a M-XL.  It was huge.  My son-in-law, who wears a 3XL, couldn't have worn it.<br />I would have loved it in a medium."
2.0,No. It is cute. I like the quilt. I don't like that the pocket for money and cards all face outward. Feels like the cards can easily fall out when closed.
2.0,"Disappointed. Isotoner has always been my favorite brand. But these are too thick, making it difficult to swipe the screen. Still useful for cold weather and driving."
2.0,I ordered red plaid leggings and they sent me a completely different pattern.  When I went to order again the pattern I wanted was out so instead of telling me they were out they sent me ones I didn't want. Could have saved everyone the extra work just by telling me they were out instead of shipping me things I just returned.  The leggings themselves were really soft though.  I would have LOVED them if they were the right pattern.
2.0,It will work but the pins need close attention because this band is not rugged and it WILL fail.
2.0,"Considering the cost, I almost got what I paid for.  It's made to fit a potato and I being a longtime Quicksilver patron, I question why this product falls so far beyond the quality I grew reliant on.  I hope this is a knock-off, because if it is genuine, Volcom and Hurley will get my future loyalty.  WTF Chuck?"
2.0,I got a medium size and its deffinetly not a small but it's like a small medium. I say that because the only comfy part is the robe. The top is a bit too short to be comfy. Sure you can get past that. Its decently cozy material wise. But the pants band around the waist are way to tight like they feel extra small that way and are a bit short as well. I'm 5'4. Weight 135 pounds.
2.0,Fabric feels hard and uncomfortable.  Returned
2.0,Nice color ad design however a little thin
2.0,Only One of the 4 pairs actually didn’t tear up the first time I tried to wear them!!!  3 pairs ripped as I was trying to wear them☹️
2.0,"This shirt runs large, the sleeves are too short, the color looks nothing like the picture (darker) it's very long, and the back goes a little above my knees. For reference I'm 5'5  34C 130lbs.  Ordered a size small. Returning."
2.0,is this band really leather? it feels nothing like it. I think its rubber or something. how everyone did not mention a one review about this crappy rubbery band? wow. I am so returning this one.
2.0,"My son loved this jacket, the only problem was the material of the interior of the jacket tore very easily so my son was very disappointed with the inexpensive material that was used to line the inside of the jacket"
2.0,Way to big for the average head.
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Material is super thin, dress is very large, and has no shape."
2.0,"Fit great, thin enough for dress boots and perfect height. Holes appeared  in them after one wear and one wash. The holes appeared on the top of my foot on both socks. Also have the herringbone version of these and have worn and washed them multiple times without any signs of wear."
2.0,Not crazy about this. Purchased for my SO who loves Star Wars. He is not a small man and this still does not stay in place (slips down) and therefore Darth Vader does not appear as one would hope. Would not recommend.
2.0,"It barely blew up ,the power of the fan was weak 🙄😒 pretty disappointed 😞"
2.0,I received the wrong color . I ordered the purple but received what I think is supposed to be maroon but in person really looks pink . I do like the way the dress fits but I really am not a pink fan.
2.0,"A fair novelty gift, but mine stretched out of shape in a couple weeks. At least my toes get exercise trying to keep them on. I guess they are made to be seen in rather than to walk around in."
2.0,These suck. They are too long and most do break trying to put them on. They look cool not gonna lie but comfort and durability are a no. Not worth it. Spend the money on just 1 real set.
2.0,"Not sure how other people feel, but when I slide my foot into a shoe, its gotta fit, feel comfortable, and wearable... strike 3 for this shoe, narrow, rigid, and heavy."
2.0,The size was perfect he doesnt wont to take them off
2.0,Pretty large for cufflinks (probably my bad for not looking more closely) and fell apart on second use.
2.0,This product has potential but they failed to add space or pouch on the front for room. These shorts crush and flatten everything making them very uncomfortable and painful.
2.0,Was way to big and not what I expected
2.0,"Very small and was cheaply made,  Order 4 different colors and returned them all."
2.0,"I loved the wallet, until the wristlet clip snapped in two after having used it all of about 2 weeks."
2.0,It's  pretty.
2.0,The butt seam split open after a few months. Very expensive for such a short life.
2.0,Material is stretchy but also itchy and see threw. Cute design but not the right material
2.0,"Fits really weird on my curvy figure. I love Grace Karin, but there are better high waisted shorts out there"
2.0,This item doesn’t lay correctly and it doesn’t look right when wearing.
2.0,Size fit but had droopy crotch and the item had a pink stain on it. Also a paper tag on the inside.
2.0,Very cute and perfect fit but so see through has to return it
2.0,It's too short and  too  tight  for size 2XX
2.0,Husband had them for 2 months and the sole is now falling off. It's too bad because they were really nice.
2.0,The zipper rubs my back
2.0,"Tried this as a running bra.  It's ok for short distances, but is not &#34;No-Bounce&#34;.  It doesn't offer enough support to ensure there is no bounce.  But I could still use it for cross training - IF the dye used in the bra didn't stain my other clothes.  After washing it, the pink still bled when I started sweating.  Go ahead and invest in a decent bra."
2.0,"Such a pretty unicorn keychain.  Really wanted to love it, but the head detached from the cone within a week of receiving it."
2.0,"I ordered a medium based on the size chart. It was way too big. Also, the olive green color was actually some purple-grey with olive green trim. I will be returning this."
2.0,Black tie was too shiny for uniform.
2.0,"This is a weird shirt.  It feels weird and is kind of see through.  I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 148 lbs, so I ordered a large. It fit fine in the body, but the sleeves were tight on my arms, which are of not heavy at all.  Had to send it back."
2.0,"I got the purple eyeglass case, which is apparently currently unavailable.  It works acceptably, although it is a bit thicker than I expected, or is necessary, and is rather bulky in my purse. I just got new prescription glasses made of Ultem, a very lightweight, thin eyeglass material. It has a magnetic sunglass attachment which is also lightweight and thin. This case is overly-large for basically my sunglass attachment. I did not receive the microfiber cleaning cloth as indicated in the product description. I sent them a message on Aug 18, and got an autobot response stating they were closed for the weekend but would update &#34;shortly.&#34; 6 days later, and nothing further from this company. Amazon made it right, as usual. Will order something else."
2.0,"short battery life, rubber band isn't attached well (just slipped through a crack, so it comes out easily), easy to crack and have 3 (dangerous for kids) tiny batteries rolling around."
2.0,"Rash have pictures to prove, most of the products are fake, it was discribed as either, sterling silver of 18k white gold.  Every ring I tried on, want full refund for all the rings."
2.0,Pleased with onyx but the blue is dull and grainy looking not the rich colour displayed
2.0,Bought for 10 year old girl. She liked it
2.0,The top part has support and its lose the middle part ..
2.0,I was really excited to get these as I thought they would be exactly what I wanted and in theory they were. I have had to return two sizes now and the consistency in those sizes are so varied I have up getting them all together. I had a 2XL that was smaller than a XL pair and an XL pair that was the largest out of all of the 2XLs..... That's not right.
2.0,"Grey and Red shirt fit well, Black one is of horribly low quality. Stitching over shoulders does not line up and opening for arms are uneven by 3 inches."
2.0,The fabric was too loosely woven to provide any support. The straps would just stretch & stretch. The zipper would not stay up for even 2 seconds.
2.0,"It looks great on, but the ornament fell off of the bar on the 3rd day.  Does anyone know where I can get a hold of them for a return/exchange?  The phone number always goes to voicemail and it is always full.  Other than that, it is a beautiful piece and I think this just may have been a faulty piece.  Thanks."
2.0,It was warm and I liked the color but I returned it because it looked super frumpy on my 5ft 130 lb body.  Maybe if I had a smaller chest it would have looked more streamlined.  I almost kept as a house coat because of the warmth. I also would have liked the option of a button/ hook closure. It hangs open.
2.0,Not sure how the top goes on haven’t been able to wear and forgot to return before due date money 💴 wasted
2.0,I was so excited to receive this dress because I love linen dresses. The dress was nice looking and material nice. Then I tried it on and the fit was strange. I do not usually have problems with the fit of dresses but this was just not right. I’m sorry to say I had to return it.
2.0,Very thin not worth the price
2.0,The beads are a nice size and look nice however I was told that the bracelet was a size 10 but I wear an 8 bracelet comfortable and this bracelet is tight on me.  I was misled.  I just hope the stones are really danburite.
2.0,"It says &#34;rain proof&#34; but not waterproof.  However, if you are outdoors in the rain and it stays damp (drizzled all day) the inner lining will peel and rip.  Not a great experience.  Not bad for what it is, but VERY difficult to keep your belongings organized inside this bag."
2.0,"Thought I was gonna love it, but the waist is too high, and the top part is about 2 sizes too small. I'm a 38D and this didn't hold me in at all! The arm area is also very tight and I can barely move. I'm a size M and ordered an M but it was too small. The dress is really pretty, with soft silky like material, but there is no stretch whatsoever. What a bummer, I was hoping to wear it soon but now it's going back, it's not nearly as flattering as the twig who's modeling it."
2.0,I like the way these look but the inch is definitely small im not sure why its so small
2.0,"Beautiful but super dainty. Broke within an hour of having it on, sadly."
2.0,"I know this is supposed to be a loose fitting shirt, but it was huge! And the color was way off. Instead of a vibrant red like the picture it was more like a faded maroon. Really disappointed."
2.0,The picture looks better than the actual item.  It works.
2.0,The sleeves kind of had a ruffle at the top I wasn’t a fan of how they were on my shoulders.
2.0,not the top one but for such cheap price I have nothing to complain.
2.0,"We were disappointed in these rings.  When we opened the package these rings remind me of the play ones we use to buy at the five n dime back in the 60's for the kids.  These are thin silicone.  If you are looking to buy some play rings for a child, then these might be for you.  We are just not impressed with these rings."
2.0,I ordered my regular size (M) pants fits good but as you can see the shirt doesn’t look like the picture & unfortunately you can’t choose a different size for the top.
2.0,It is cute but did not hold my shawl together. Any pull and it comes undone.
2.0,"I bought the Plus size 18 because I had a short timeframe for a wedding with the length of the shipping time. The fit was not of a plus size. The boning was not placed for a curvy figure, and the breast cups were a B at best. There was no support that actually fit my body. The dress laces up, there is no zipper, which was unclear from the photos, and it's impossible to lace oneself into the dress, an assistant is required. Once laced up, my chest was on display. I couldn't get the shoulders to stay up either, and it had a very ""bar wench"" like feel to the unflattering fit. That was not the wedding look I was going for for my husbands' business partners nuptials."
2.0,Very cheap looking and not at all the support they said they had
2.0,"This pajamas is different as shown in the picture, and with pretty poor quality. The materials are cheap and not comfortable. Had to return it."
2.0,"The material feels & looks cheap😔Def NOT like in the picture,  I'm pretty disappointed. I washed & wore it hoping it would look & feel better on... it didn't. I will keep it because it's a easy to throw on summer dress & looks &#34;ok&#34; but def. won't order anymore"
2.0,"Nicely made and a decent price for being real gold, but the stud is so small (non-existent) that the earring goes right through the pierced opening, and so really it's just a chain loop that isn't all that flattering (or interesting) once it's on."
2.0,"The design is super cute, but I could not even get it over my chest and I ordered the XL. My guess is the band around the bottom is not stretchy enough. Had to return."
2.0,Returned as the gold on the clasp was peeling off from the plastic protector
2.0,After first wash started coming apart.
2.0,"Arms were too tight, I could not get the top on."
2.0,super cute and form fitting. Usually always wear a small with no issues..it was a little short when I got it but after washing it once it shrunk so much I can't wear it.
2.0,Was not worth what I paid. Came apart very easy in the seems. Didnt like them material. Cheaply made for the price
2.0,"The glasses are beautiful but the lenses fall out and I do not know if to return them back or what.<br />I have been popping the lens back in, but I feel like they do not need to be pop back in.<br />I would like them replace."
2.0,"Having pocket flaps is a genius idea. That’s the entire reason I bought this. I was so excited to open it, but then so disappointed when I did. The fabric was awful. Nylon can end up as so many different things. This particular “nylon” is like a dollar store version of a shower curtain liner. I am not hating, I will purchase shower curtain liners there until they close every last one, that’s how I know what they feel like. Perfect to keep your fabric shower curtain dry, but not great for an apron that isn’t disposable. It didn’t look like it would stand up to any harder cleaning than gingerly dabbing at it with q-tip. I do up to 25 haircuts a day. I need to be able to wash it. If you don’t need something that lasts long, you might like it. But for my needs, it wasn’t worth $20."
2.0,My toes were extremely cramped after putting this in. Do not recommend unless your shoes are oversized.
2.0,Pants are very tight on ankles
2.0,Way too small! I bought an XL!
2.0,"I am an older woman who prefers medium-small bags,<br />so the exterior size is okay.  However, the inside is<br />littler--and tight with no give.  A petit wallet, eye<br />glass case, i Phone, lip gloss, and keys barely fit.<br />The PU leather is heavy, and the black looks to me<br />like a dark grey.  The bow is cute enough, but<br />probably a style better used by a younger lady."
2.0,Fit was a bit larger than expected. It is a nice looking item but not very warm. Made in China. Somewhat disappointed with this purchase.
2.0,"Unlike Congress, you barely notice how polarized these glasses are. So imperceptible that I checked with my sunglasses - yes, they are, but you barely notice a difference at night. Very sturdy frame, well made case and polishing cloth these would probably have good use as an evening outdoors aid rather than improving your night-vision while driving as advertised. Seem really durable,."
2.0,Gave it 2 stars because when I received it was just what I was looking for but when I wore it for the first time some of the pearls started falling off.  I am very careful with all my jewelry so was very disappointed that this happened.
2.0,It’s wasnt what I expected 😢 I was almost like a maxi dress
2.0,Seem to be a little flimsy.
2.0,Very small and the material is awful! Don't waste your money
2.0,I read great reviews and bought this. It was NOT flattering at all. I don’t be wearing this dress
2.0,this was my fault. it has the word tiny in the description but i didn't realize it would be that small. anyway it is a nice set of earrings.  : ) long as you know the size you are getting  you will be happy! I just think they should have options. Small medium or large size to choose from.
2.0,"I'm so disappointed with this. I used it twice and on the second use, I had trouble getting it to close back down. I pressed the button and it collapsed, but would only go part way. I was eventually able to force it back down and then had to turn it to get it to line up to latch again. The problem is that when it won't fold down, it also would fold out. It's as if it has to latch again before you can &#34;trigger&#34; the button again.<br /><br />I had hoped for the price that I found something perfect for getting into the office on rainy days. But I am very disappointed. For now it is working, but I'm very skeptical, if I had a problem after only two uses."
2.0,"The straps are not adjustable and the front came up way higher on me than in the pictures. Needed longer straps. Also, the waist hit me in a weird place. Returning it."
2.0,This mask is thick and uncomfortable to breathe through even without the filter. May the force be with you with the filter. I am not happy with it but I guess in the winter it will be all the rage.
2.0,"Save your money and get the backpack style one. That one is at least 2x better than this. The buckles loosen  too. This, and the grab handle is too far down. It's better than nothing, and might give you some added safety on a lift."
2.0,"Product looks nothing in person like it does in the picture. Ordered this for a formal event, got it three days before, and need to send it back and find a new dress. Very disappointed with this product. May work better for someone with a bigger bust than me or someone who can spruce up such a drab dress. Giving two stars because at least the fabric was comfortable."
2.0,Received bracelet broken.  Missing string on one side
2.0,"These feel nice, but are see-through when I bend. I won’t be able to wear them without a long shirt."
2.0,"Not sure what these arw made of.  I was cleaning my ears with a white washcloth and a bunch of green dye rubbed off the ""jade"" earrings!"
2.0,"These are not Uskees brand. They have a label that says ""wash"" brand on them. Thin and cheaply made."
2.0,I was very disappointed to see fading on the dress when it arrived. It was as if it had been left in the sun in some parts.<br /><br />Material is definitely cheap and see through. Pockets are too heavy for the dress and you can feel them flying around.
2.0,I wasn't that happy with the quality or the condition.  it's a gift and I don't want to try and send back a bless it doesn't fit.  I have no idea what size it is because the rag was ripped out which left a hole in it 🥲
2.0,"I thought they would have a stiffer material.  They are thin, flimsy and unflattering"
2.0,The zipper pull broke off on the second try. Avoid this problem.
2.0,Runs small even ordered up a size.
2.0,"Not really . I expected way better quality material. It's a great picture but very flimsy material, if it had some kind of interior liner I would love it more, Lots of space and pockets"
2.0,"Too small shapely women, had to give it to a friend."
2.0,"These are soft plastic, and so came with one horn squashed in the middle. I needed it for a costume so I cut a slit and stuffed it with packing bubble plastic. Fix worked but should not be needed. Buyer beware."
2.0,The lettering was very small
2.0,very fashionable but they are not durable they began to fall apart after wearing them for a week. I was disappointed. Because they were so nice.
2.0,The re design has ruined this shoe
2.0,good shipping but buy large the teen sizes are way to small.
2.0,"This is a beautiful piece pictured here and in the packaging, however it does not sit flush and is substantially smaller then expected. I wouldn’t recommend it. May we This was an exception that was not made like pictures."
2.0,I expected a different fabric.  The sleeves are a little tight too.
2.0,"Works well but band color is much more Orange than brown, so the image is misleading."
2.0,Clasp does not lock in closed position.  Received a credit for purchase
2.0,"The lances were distorted, gave me a headache. it's a shame because they looked great."
2.0,I returned this item. Seemed big in some areas & smaller in others. Just not as I pictured.
2.0,"Once I recieved the product, I immediately wanted to put it back in the package to send it back.  It is very cheaply made and it looks nothing like the one you see on the model.  The material is really thin.  I was going to send it back, but my daughter said she could use it for a part of a costume.  I guess I should have known that for the price that was what I was going to get."
2.0,Definitely not as bright of green as the picture shows
2.0,"When I ordered this I was excited,but when i received it I was very disappointed..It was missing the hair ties,the choker and the two bells that are supposed to connect to the hair ties that never came,on top of that,the bag it came in was ripped,and the outfit was to large,and i went off the measurments..so..overall not happy,really regret buying it..."
2.0,Don't fit to big
2.0,"Strong and sturdy, but the covering seems to have started coming off within the first month."
2.0,"I do not trust this case to protect. The top and bottom are completely exposed and it is NOT a secure fit. I guarantee if this is dropped, the phone will fly out from the case.<br /><br />Gave it a 2 star since it looks decent."
2.0,This bracelet broke the second time I wore it.
2.0,"A couple of the ties on the bracelets came undone after wearing a handful of times, and one elastic bracelet broke already."
2.0,"Purchased this to condense my glasses into one container in my purse. While large enough for this purpose, the snap on the on the large section broke after 2 days use. Now there is no closure for this section."
2.0,The band is slightly too wide.<br />May need to be trimmed with a scissors in order to be able to align pin.
2.0,"2 of them have already came apart. They have been used in an office environment and we are not even rough with them, only a pulled of people use them."
2.0,Nice color but very flimsy and design at top on front blocked sensors on iPhone and caused it to not function properly.
2.0,ok for the money -the main faux stone has a air buble but for the price I will keep it.
2.0,Returning it. I ordered white and they are VERY see through! Also smaller than I expected.
2.0,Small and cheap material.
2.0,"These are very light weight and cute BUT they are SO slippery. I purchased a pair for my 3 yo and my 4.5 yo and they both slid and fell multiple times while wearing them. There is no grip and they slide very easily, even on dry concrete."
2.0,This sweatshirt runs super small. An Adult small would fit like an xxs. Buy a much bigger size.
2.0,Definitely get what you pay for. The charms dangle so far it gets caught in clothing all the time. My navel also became irritated due to the gold plating.
2.0,"I thought I measured 4mm before ordering but upon receipt of very pretty earrings, 4mm is waaay to small.  Difficult to put on."
2.0,"Soooo this WOULD have been cute if it was a CHILDS pantsuit.  I ordered an XL and I was sent a youth 2XL and the company brand on the bag was a children’s clothing company, it surprisingly fit but the pant part was high waters. Pretty sure it’s just cheap from<br />China. Bummed bc I really wanted it to work"
2.0,It was too small and; it looks more light a dance costume that a regular dress.
2.0,Item was not checked prior to shipment. Received cami without shelf bra! Hate returning items!!
2.0,Was way too tight around the waste and I ordered a 3x which is usually 1 size up than I usually can order. I would need a 4x in this size and I’m rather disappointed.
2.0,It's not what I thought it would be but I gave one to my sister and friend
2.0,It's a nice sweater but not true to size.  I usually wear a 1X or at max a 2X.  By luck I ordered a 3X and it fits but not that much wiggle room.
2.0,"This out overall fit well, except the slit on the right leg. I'm not sure what it was, but the slit exposed a lot more of the upper thigh than preferred. If only they made the slit less exposed or just close the gap altogether, I think we'd have a winner"
2.0,Thank you for the easy way to return!
2.0,The edges of this were not clean cut and frayed.  Purchased another one from another supplier with much cleaner edges.
2.0,"The quality of the hat feel very cheap for the price listed, another thing is the foam part of the hat can get wrinkled and look ugly. The hat is size adjustable but it sits high at the front. not worth the price."
2.0,"Very cute just to small I ordered a size 18 and it was to small, if ordering this order at leastone size bigger than normal"
2.0,"While I love the color, the size was not similar to standard USA sizes. It was too small. The material was too light too for a graceful look. I was disappointed."
2.0,"This umbrella arrived as if someone had just used it & threw it in a box.  It did not have a sleeve, it was not even totally folder & secured.  Maybe it came from a dollar store...for less than a dollar.  Not worth sending back, but truly a piece of trash."
2.0,These are very thin and run large but cute pattern
2.0,"Not a bad shirt if you’re super skinny. Ordered an XL and it was tight on me, normally an XL is big and loose fitting, like the picture."
2.0,These shirts are adorable but the sizing is too small.. I ordered the medium which is supposed to be an 8/10 but the shirts are more like a size 5/6.
2.0,The fit of this bodysuit is extremely off.  The bottom of the suit is quite tight while the top is literally falling off of you.  The sleeves are very tight as well.
2.0,"The  inseams of this clothing, are not stitched well! My daughters crotch area was already pulling apart before she could try them on! Not such a great buy!"
2.0,Cute dress but a little long hit way below the knee and I’m 5’3
2.0,After one wash it started falling apart
2.0,"They fit ok, but I feel like the back strap was too long or in a weird spot or something. Something was just off. I returned them"
2.0,"Very thin and won’t last for at least couple of times, hard to wear for kids and hardly opens it could tear easily."
2.0,I bought the large so it would feel loose. I'm 5'7 and 135 and the waist slid right down me. no way to tighten it. Not a fan of the thin bathing suit material either. returned it.
2.0,"Dress ran small, despite following the size chart. It fit, but was really tight. It was also super short on me. I’m 5’8, and it barely covered my butt and crotch. There was also a lot of loose strings hanging off. I returned it."
2.0,very cute if you're skinny. But I'm curvy and the striping around the waist seemed irregular and made it not appealing. Kinda frumpy. I would have liked the similar style better with the higher tie.
2.0,Not for thick earlobes and plastic pops off won't stay on on one of them
2.0,Was looking forward to a wine shirt. It arrived and is definitely Red. Sad about the color but will keep it cause I need a new work shirt
2.0,I ordered a Large and it looked like it would fit a 13 year old. Wasn't too happy with it. I thought it was a little cheaply made. I gave it 2 stars only because I gave it to a 13 year old. Live and learn.
2.0,The stone part of the earring falls off post after wearing for a while. Not connected very well. Cost more to have them fix than the earrings cost.
2.0,"This item is printed only on one side on rather thin material.  The printing faded after two washes, and was more or less gone after five wash/dry cycles.  I now have cloth squares with just a faint hint that it was once printed.  I suspect that the printing is not heat proof, and deteriorates in the dryer."
2.0,it broke within the first two days
2.0,"I wore the jacket while working in moderate rain for about 2.5 hours .  When I took it off, the clothing covering my upper back / shoulders and arms were wet. Not drenched, but wet to the touch.  I thought maybe I was sweating, but my clothing on the skin side was dry.  Unfortunately, this jacket does not completely stop the rain, which is the primary reason why I purchased a ""rain suit"".  Purchase at your own risk."
2.0,Size is barely a 7 in hat size. I wear a 7 1/8 ..Leather would be better suited for the sole of my boots. I am now soaking the visor in Neatsfoot oil in an attempt to soften it up enough to wear. Will also have to add a piece of leather to make it fit. Pretty disappointed to be sure.
2.0,This was way to small for my husband.
2.0,Loved the material . Loved the color . But to small even when ordered xx large . And sleeves to tight . Usually wears large or x large in jackets. Very disappointed in th fit of the sleeves. Thought order large enough.
2.0,It looks cheap for the price.  I'm returning.
2.0,"The quality of this strap is excellent; it's the design that's flawed.  The buckle end of the strap is too short to make it to the back of my wrist, it only gets about 3/4 of the way there.  It seems to be beautifully made but, as I said, poorly designed.  Not recommended"
2.0,It quit after 4 days.
2.0,Didn't work as described
2.0,"The skirt is completely see through and the top is tiny. I’m 34B and my boobs were spilling out, which NEVER happens to me. For reference, I usually wear a small in dresses and I’m a 5-7 in jeans and I bought a medium. I just didn’t like the fit at all, looked very cheap. I’ve already begun the return process because I would never wear this."
2.0,"Didn't look right on me and I didn't like anything about it. This dress is a combination of a black T-shirt top (I though it will be a navy color) and cotton-blend skirt which would need the ironing before each wear. Since I am tall (5'9&#34;, 170 lb, 38C) the waist line was sitting ridiculously high and dress is short for me. Size XL fitted loose, and I put it on without using a zipper. I guess size L will fit better (I bought both sizes), but since I didn't like the dress I didn't bother to try it on in the other size or take a picture of it."
2.0,"The pink ones do not have much of a tint. I love the shape, but they looks like regular clear glasses."
2.0,Wires not connected and I cannot figure out how to apply to the eyes  and no necklace and its confusing<br />Returning  no instructions! Sorry also can't fit a grown man won't give as a gift
2.0,"Wife said the material was questionable cause it was thin and thought it might tear easy, but her main concern was that it was tight in some places and loose in other places."
2.0,"My 2nd pair of these. 1st one was a 5-star. The 2nd one was promising with some new details to improve the attachment of the silicone strip around the thighs, no slide up the thighs etc. padding seems good. BUT!!!! I get a blister/sore on my little fellah every time I ride with it and it leave a sore that makes go nuts when I step into the shower. Can’t see if it is a seam or what it is but a sore/wounded willy hurts a lot!!!!"
2.0,"It looks inexpensive, cheap."
2.0,the belly piercing itself was missing a diamond and the chain wasn't connected to the piercing. the two things came separate and I had a problem with both
2.0,They are much larger than I expected.  I assumed since they were unisex they wouldn't be so big.  Will save them for next winter and hope they fit under my hat.
2.0,Looks really cheap. Something $2 worth.
2.0,Muy caras
2.0,"Pretty pink color. Finally, a new blouse with an adequate bust for us big girls."
2.0,"It is too tight.  It smashes my nose to the point of being really uncomfortable.  I think I can reuse it to create something more comfortable, at least."
2.0,I just received item and it definitely will not keep you warm in the middle of the winter. My cardigan sweater is a lot heavier and this is fine as just a throw on to keep warm inside. The size runs small. I normally wear med and I bought a large to have extra room and it’s snug. Shipping is from China so if you want it right away than think twice.
2.0,"I loved the fabric and most of the fit but as you can see, the shoulders are very off. The seam is not where it should be and I don’t think I am particularly wide. Sad."
2.0,Sizes run SMALL
2.0,I received no packing slip to the return the item.  It was marked 4x instead it was much smaller than a 2x.  Love the suit but don't dare order again because the same thing could occur again.
2.0,Feels cheap and weird. Pockets dont lay down and look weird.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Don't waste your money on this. You can make a better one from going to a hobby store.
2.0,The hat is awful very cheap and the glove finger part is so long it doesn’t fit but the gold wing pin is nice but it super glue from the front to the back part
2.0,The material is ok not bad. The only complain i have is its too lose for a size XS- on the other hand its a us sze- seller please make an XXS- for a 5 star in the future. Shipment was on time thank you!
2.0,Thought these were going to fit easily as the size chart’s dimensions described. Sadly they were WAY too small! Didn’t return but they make great Swiffer covers!!!
2.0,I bought this watch for 13.99. It seemed to work fine. After 2 months a convenient amount of time after the 30-day return policy the watch band just snapped off. The plastic I guess rotted?<br /><br />Purchased May 12th 2022 - watch band broken July 20th 2022.
2.0,Wallet is ok but frankly a really bad design. You have to fold your cash to get it into the wallet. Photo is 2 monies and no credit cards
2.0,I originally got this as a birthday gift and loved it so much they do really run small however at first it worked great and now it just stopped heating up I have fully charged up the battery and it just blinks randomly through each setting and then turns off does not even get a little bit warm.... I am very sad about this since I work outside and live in Virginia
2.0,"This dress had so much potential.  The cut was attractive and unusual, and the contrasting gold piping gave it some nice visual interest and a flattering shape.  The fabric is light and flowy but not see-through at all.  BUT, as other reviews have mentioned, this dress is poorly made.  The waist band on the dress I received was completely crooked, off by more than a quarter of an inch from side to side, and the stitching was very sloppy.  A quarter of an inch doesn't sound like much, but it's extremely noticeable on a dress with waistband that is very defined by the piping and should be straight.  In addition, the back zipper is very ""sticky"" and gets stuck near the waist piping.  I had to have my husband help me get out of it!"
2.0,Sizes are nit accurate as stated
2.0,"The straps tore off during the first wear - cute, but really disappointing."
2.0,It is definitely not a workout shirt. It does not fit snug and I’ve an athletic build . Was hoping to wear it to the gym to see those pumps but guess that isn’t happening. Bummer product
2.0,The hanger strap was sewn on the wrong side of the dress. Some of the stiches were coming undone. Other wise this dress is very pretty and the fabric is very stretchy and comfortable.
2.0,I am super disappointed in this shirt! It’s so thin! Not at all like any of my other Simply Southern shirts.
2.0,Poor quality. Very cheap (beauty design... But extremely poor quality)
2.0,Overall the necklace is cute.. it’s a bit smaller in person and the charm gets tangled easily
2.0,Nose piece broke off after wearing for a few minutes.  Bought it for my son and it's so cheap. I was going to return it but he wanted to keep it so we glued it.
2.0,"I got these to go with the mask and they are not good quality, if you are using these for your child to go trick or treating or for yourself to a halloween party or haunted house, I would say don't. They are not practical and I had to return them because the ""fur"" came off and they have a horrible smell. They do look okay in pictures though."
2.0,Seems cheap and they look bad. Polarization is minimal - mostly tinted.
2.0,To thin material.  Thought I would try thinner socks but I miss the thicker more cushy sock.  Plus I wore them with cowboy boots and they don't stay up.  Would probably be good for dressy shoes but not as active wear.
2.0,This shirt had to go back. Took s ling time to arrive.  Was a very small fit
2.0,"The stone is nice, but I doubt it is &#34;silver plated.&#34; I can't have it touching my skin or I get a rash."
2.0,"Although proper size was ordered, the dress was much too small…order at least 2 sizes larger than your usual!"
2.0,More of a tunic then a dress.
2.0,Ordered a 3x. Fit like a medium.
2.0,Nice quality and comfortable but it doesn’t stick well. Disappointed...
2.0,"Returned due to length If it were a normal length or longer  I would have kept it! Shirt was way to short but fit great. Beautiful and soft just as pictured. Im a size Medium and ordered small as Amazon suggested.  It fit great except it was way to short, i don't do belly shirts. Very disappointed because I really wanted this shirt"
2.0,"This is my sixth pair of Saucony Women's shoes and I am not able to wear these!  The part of the shoe near the toes must have been made differently from my past pairs.  I am so disappointed and the &#34;return&#34; window has passed. I'm going to try and contact the manufacturer directly, but I will be hesitant to purchase online Saucony again."
2.0,"I was looking for a structured tote that would stand up and not collapse on itself, my #1 priority (apart from it also being metallic leather). The leather was pretty. After I took the tote out of the packaging, I set it up on a table and walked away. Then I heard a &#34;plop&#34; because it had collapsed and hit the floor. It's going back."
2.0,Color is not like picture
2.0,Color not as pictured. It is less teal and more like a forest green. Quality appears poor but the graphic is nice.
2.0,"I read previous reviews so got a size larger. Shouldn't have!  I should have got my true size, however it is large enough to wear over leggings and have the slouchy luck."
2.0,Did not like the fabric and not entirely what I expected
2.0,"Viene muy grande ! Yo normalmente soy 3 de pantalón , pedí talla S y parece como si fuera M-L"
2.0,Fit as expected but wouldn’t recommend. Threads kept coming undone and kept getting caught on my ring and purse zipper and everything imaginable. Every time I turned around there was a loose thread or ball falling off. Worked well for 1 day but won’t be wearing again.
2.0,"My ring came in a bag, no box.  It's very thin and not very wide.  The writing is so faint I could barely see it. I actually thought it was just a plain gold band for a bit until I caught it in the light just right.  It is on the inside and outside.  This is so thin it feels like I could easily crush the ring flat.  I'm kind of afraid to wear it or touch it because I think I might just break it that easily.<br /><br />Overall because this feels so fragile I can't really recommend anything other than not buying it.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
2.0,Did not really reflect what the picture showed and it was way too short even though I bought it two sizes bigger.
2.0,"Didn’t receive the colors pictured at all.  No purple, light blue/white, pink/blue.  Instead black and black/yellow.  Bought these for my daughter so not helpful.  Warm but quality seems so so."
2.0,These are the most annoying things. Don’t sit well the ear. Returned.
2.0,I wanted to love these but they are just icky - not soft - and what is with the sizing thing? - oh its ok it says a large but its really a xx large dont worry? - I should have known this was not going to work and in fact had doubts from the get go - sadly they were confirmed - the item in this package is just not what this woman is wearing - this might fit a child - not a xxlarge fattie like me - bali and maidenform did not let me down - this one did
2.0,Not as pictured! Very cheap. Had a weird point where the patch was sewn on. Patch is not centered. You get what you pay for.
2.0,The neck is very thin and stretched out<br />Very disappointed
2.0,It fits as expected and feels amazing but it wasn’t as expected. It looks a bit cheap in person because of the sewing details. They need to hide the thread.
2.0,Fun coin to use with the hubby 👍🏽🙂 BUT too small for the price the charge
2.0,Fabric is very tight (not at all stretchy like a sweatshirt should be) and the lettering isn't as clear to see what is written on your shirt.
2.0,Kept sliding around and if you sweat at all it did not work
2.0,I lost the the 1st ring because the bar was too short and I'm just waiting to see how long it will take for the 2nd one to fall out. They are pretty but not a good size for big noses.
2.0,"My wife spent literally hours sifting through Amazon to find the perfect bag (using money from her birthday) and, very unfortunately, this in her own words &#34;one of the worst purchases I've ever made&#34;. Within a month of using it (most of the contents being a wallet, a paperback book, and a few small miscellaneous items) the &#34;dividers&#34; and pockets began to rip off the sides, rendering them useless soon after. She eventually got SO annoyed with the insides continually falling down, that she took scissors to them and took out the pockets. Now the inside looks awful and she cannot organize anything.  The one and ONLY reason this does not have just one star is because the outside does look good and she can still use it while she hunts for a good bag in the meantime. Seriously, DO NOT waste your time with this bag. It will fall apart on you. Very disappointed."
2.0,cheap and broken parts.
2.0,Good finish but the chain broke on the first day of use
2.0,This is a stretchy cheaply made jacket. CLEARLY not the same one photgraphed
2.0,Will not stay in my ear. Keeps falling out.
2.0,Ended up buying an extra large for my medium sized daughter and still snug in some areas but she's keeping it.
2.0,"The look and style was great, but the sizes are way off for loose fit shorts and a size larger than I actually am, they are so tight in the thight and crotch what a waste of time and money. Will have to return them and choose a totally different short, because these are ridiculously small and feels llike parachute pants not a denim or heavy cargo style fabric..."
2.0,Wash these before you wear them or they will smell funky. These have a pouch for your junk that makes it stand out. I prefer under wear that flattens my junk in my pants. Different strokes for different folks.
2.0,"Too big, too heavy, sent back"
2.0,I like getting neck scarves to use as head wraps because they are normally thicker but these were then and see through. No matter how I wrapped it my hair couldn't be concealed.
2.0,"I bought this because I’ve been looking for a great green dress for years, but I’m always skeptical to buy clothes online because of fit issues. I usually wear a small, so that’s what I ordered, figuring, if anything it would be too tight around the hips and thighs. Instead, it was too big everywhere.  For reference, I am 5’3”, anywhere between 114-118 lbs, smaller chest, and a bit bottom heavy.  The dress fell several inches below the knee, but I figured when I ordered it that I’d have to hem it. I got the version that is asymmetrical off the shoulder, and the strap needs taken in about an inch to keep it looking like an intentional design, rather than a strap that just won’t stay up on my shoulder. The dress is really loose in the midsection, which makes all of the nice pleating detail look like sloppy rumples instead. The dress has a nice stretch to it, but it’s so oversized that nothing actually has to stretch for me to wear it, not even over my widest bits. I can’t fault it too much because there is a sizing chart that I should have followed, but there is no other size smaller.  Free returns are available, but I haven’t decided yet whether I will send it back.  I really like the dress, but I’m not sure if it would honestly be worth my time (or within my abilities) to try to alter it.  If there was an extra small, I would definitely exchange it."
2.0,"We wash all new clothes before wearing them.  White, very noticeable strings began coming out of the solid green color after a single wash.  It's unfortunate because my son LOVES it and got a lot of compliments on the cat design at school."
2.0,"Mixed sizes. One fits perfect, one too tight, one too small. He’s skinny so it’s odd they’d fit that way"
2.0,"This tie is nice quality, but it is NOT EXTRA LONG.  It is about 4 inches short of that description.  Did not serve my purpose"
2.0,"It made me sweat great. But my very first time using it, it broke. I didn't pull hard or anything. Very thin & poorly made."
2.0,"I ordered this because I loved the combination of colors, however, the rhinestones on this necklace is very large and gaudy.  The circumference of the necklace is at the same time, too small.  The chain on the back will allow you to possibly expand the chain to wear the necklace, but then it will not lay down flat.  I ordered this for me, but once I saw it in person, it looked only good enough as dress up play jewelry so I gave it to my preschooler."
2.0,"If fit fine, but the fabric of the footbed was too slippery and could actually be dangerous. Too bad, cute slipper."
2.0,Love the shorts but order a size bigger
2.0,"The insert is way too short to cover my wallet.  It is probably better than nothing, but not much more.."
2.0,These were way too big for my face.  They are nice looking glasses for a pretty good price but definitely not for small faces. I had to return them.
2.0,They were a lot smaller than I expected them to be
2.0,"poor quality sweater, size too large"
2.0,"Unfortunately, these are really really small."
2.0,"It looks and feels really cheap. I mean not a bad price at all, but was expecting more?"
2.0,"Not the best quality, deteriorates after washing."
2.0,"Very loose, no shape, seems to run big."
2.0,Size was small and a very thin shirt. Won't last long that's for sure
2.0,SO uncomfortable I couldn't wear them so they were sent back. Not as cute in the picture either.
2.0,"Pro: Material feels nice, would have been great if it fit.<br /><br />Con: Ordered an XL instead of an L because I wanted it to be a looser fit.  I received in the mail an XXL, but it was WAY too small.  Also &#34;Linen Blend&#34; means 10% linen, 90% cotton, which is factually a &#34;blend&#34; but not nearly as much linen as one would expect."
2.0,Runs Really small.
2.0,Disappointed with this bag.  One zipper doesn't work and another zipper sticks.
2.0,Bought this for a halloween costume. Have to have my grandmother alter it because i ordered a small amd it fits like a large
2.0,Didn’t like just can’t breathe in them
2.0,Mine I received were thicker than expected and didn’t stick to my glasses. I have plastic lenses so maybe that’s the reason. Will return
2.0,This is pink not red
2.0,"I ordered a size up and the dress still fit awkward. The amazon's general sizing chart will not work for this product, they need to have their own.Was not happy with the look at all"
2.0,This dress is really awkward on the arms so the make of how you tie the strings is weird i could make it work for me and i am a true medium this dress was baggy in the front and tight fitting on my back the picture i posted with it crossed around my chest it was backwards i was trying anything
2.0,"This ran kind of small.  Might have kept it but the zipper was cheap looking and didn’t work well,"
2.0,The shirts are totally out of proportion. It's short in the waist and huge in the neck. They<br />do not fit well
2.0,It looks cheap.  The design and wording is just on one side.  I wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:706ddedde96685a32aa0e0b83acac620]] It feels like a woman's shirt.  Arm holes too small.  Love the feeling but i couldn't wear in public
2.0,Way thinner than I thought.
2.0,Recieved item today and when I went to open the clasp to try it on the clasp broke. Shame bc it's very pretty
2.0,"Dress was beautiful until i stepped into the light and my daughter could see through the bottom section of the dress....if the material was a little thicker or not see through, this dress would have been perfect. I am assuming you could wear a slip however, it would need to be floor length."
2.0,I don’t think these are children socks but they feel like it or they were made for people with very small calves. My pikachu actually evolved to a Raichu when I put them on.
2.0,The sizes were for fingers not toes - even when you adjusted them to fit.
2.0,This skirt is not a skater skirt. It’s more straight a line skirt. There are no pleats in this skirts
2.0,I had really high hopes for this suit but the fit is off. I am usually a medium so that is what I ordered. Bottoms were tight but not horrible. The top has very little support. Your boobs would have to be set very wide apart for coverage. The straps made me feel like I was wearing a tank top. I really wanted to like it but this is made for someone who doesn't have much of a chest.
2.0,"Low quality, Looks very cheap"
2.0,Theyre so cute but i was disappointed by how light the weight was and how quick the gold<br />Colors turned.
2.0,"This wallet appears to no longer be for sale, but in the event that it is offered again I'm following up with a review of its lifetime. You can't beat its diminutive size, but getting cards in and out when you need them (especially other than the two outer slots) is a serious chore. The glue used in its construction leaves a lot of black tacky residue on cards. The biggest issue is that (at least for me) it lasted only 2 years before stitching started coming out, so I've lost the use of a whole pocket of the wallet, though I have put in fewer cards than it advertises."
2.0,"These are fine, I bought them to walk the dog in the winter on the beach where I live. They won't win you any beauty contests but the small size and the black color makes them less offensive than other sheepskin monstrosities. However, the black dye on the boots was not well saturated in the sheepskin. This led to me having black dyed feet when I wore them, which was bothersome to say the least. I had to try to wash the inside lining with a wet towel following some instructions I found, and even then there was still some residual dye. After months of wear, this finally stopped. But now, the boots are dirty from the salt and dirt and snow of last year so even though the inside dye is gone they're pretty shot for me to be stoked about pulling them out for the new cold season."
2.0,It is a very nice bag but it was bigger than I thought so I gave it do my daughter she loves it.
2.0,"Very pretty colors and bows however, there was glue hanging from all of them. One of the bows busted right when I put it on my 8 month old. They were all different sizes and are a little tight on my baby girl. I usually love Ema JNe bows but these were poorly made and I don't think I'll be ordering again. Looks like they were made in a rush but I didn't pay much so I'm not too upset."
2.0,it was ok but a little cheaper looking than I thought it would be
2.0,This top is very short with a boxy fit. I feel the photos do not adequately portray the fit. I did not find it to be flattering. The fabric and color seemed to be good quality. I returned it.
2.0,Wouldn’t recommend!
2.0,While this is a quality hat I returned it. Wasn't happy the way it sat on my head. It doesn't really have a peak in the front. It fits right over and close to the hair. The back enclosure is a piece of fabric. Personally I didn't like. Maybe you will. I don't know.
2.0,"For the price, I was really excited for these.  I figured they'd be a cheap option to have around considering the ease and frequency with which I lose nose studs.  My plan worked well for about an hour, and before I got a nosebleed from stabbing it into the inside of my nose accidentally.  I've worn the hooked studs like these before and never had that problem.  With these, though, the hook is so long that it is much easier to induce an injury.  Also, they repeatedly stick too far out of your nose (again because of how long the post is), so get used to people telling you &#34;your nose studs falling out&#34;...<br /><br />These might be good for someone with a different shaped nose and/or who is less accident prone, but they did NOT work well for me."
2.0,Fit was way off compared to other similar styles by other manufacturers AND the same manufacturer! Super tight. And that stretches the lace to the point that the fabric beneath sticks above the lace.
2.0,"I returned it because the quality of the fabric was low. The design is nice, on the picture. Once I got it on hands, I changed my mind."
2.0,This was purchased as a temporary strap for an Oris while the bracelet is cleaned and repaired. It will work but was poorer quality than I expected. Especially the clasp.
2.0,"Bought it as a gift. For the price, I expected it to be made of much thicker material and the arms are tight. It's cute, but not worth 28.99."
2.0,"This dress was cute but due to static I couldn't keep it. Even trying it on it stuck everywhere and was clingy. Would have driven me crazy. Also the colour was not as ordered. I chose turquoise and received a light green.<br />I ordered 2 dresses (same size, different colours). The difference in the cuts was noticeable. One had the waistband up under the bust, the other was dropped down to the waist. So....be prepared! Both dresses going back."
2.0,"Used them on my 14 mile bicycle commute to/from work in the winter months.  They are fine down to about 20°F/-6°C and as long as there is wind on your face.  Otherwise you just can't keep them from fogging up.  Once they do fog up in the cold, the fog tends to freeze and won't clear up.  Ended up going with [[ASIN:B0038ZYRGC Bolle Mojo Snow Goggles (Shiny Black, Clear)]] instead."
2.0,Lens do not stay in when you switch them<br />Out
2.0,The top part was too close in the middle causing my B36 boobs to spill out the sides. Wayyyy too close in the front.
2.0,"Inconvenient, very tight. It is very difficult to put on and take off."
2.0,I love it! But it broke after 2 weeks..
2.0,The picture with Santa in front of the tree shows a nice plush suit.  The one they actually sent is thin see through material with an overly large neck hole and this suit is essentially a TShirt with some white fluff down the middle and on the sleeves.  The pants are shorts.  Its not worth any money.
2.0,This is so cute but not to squat proof!
2.0,"There are no pockets or slots inside or outside to put a cellphone, or pair of glasses, or wallet, or even a credit card. The interior is all black which causes anything placed inside to be difficult to find.<br /><br />Also, this wouldn't be a nice small travel purse because it doesn't even fold down to pack in a suitcase."
2.0,"Ring is very small & will not stretch much unfortunately.  This was a gift for my bf & it didnt fit any of his fingers, not even his pinkies. And he said the wings actually cut into your fingers with the sharp edge, really a show piece, and for the price, i cannot really complain"
2.0,"Not terribly bad looking, but way too bulky on the wrist. Heavy and uncomfortable. The worst part was the seconds hand stopped working after 1 day! Returned."
2.0,"The earrings are quite beautiful, and I love them. But as soon as I got them I had to take them to the jeweler because they had satyr them wrong and they were uneven. The Jeweler had to cut them apart and resigner them. However I do feel that they were worth every penny even though I had to spend $14 fixing them,"
2.0,I really liked these but the color chipped off after 1 wearing where ever I rest my wrist.
2.0,Material suave . La talla muy corta
2.0,I liked the color and weight of the fabric but they were too small. Normally a size XL fit very well.
2.0,"The 16mm head came off the first time I used them. They seem like decent wrenches, but for this much money they should be put together better than this!"
2.0,Shirt fits fine in the shoulders but is VERY tight across the midsection...at least a full size smaller. The colors are VERY faded and not brilliant like I expected. Would definitely not recommend buying.
2.0,"This was the weirdest fitting thing ever. I am 5'7&#34;, 130 lbs, 32C and usually wear a size 0-2 in pants and a XS to S in tops. The top of this was HUGE on me (I wore a turtleneck underneath, I would never be able to wear it the way it's shown in the picture), but my buns were hanging out of the bottom (so I also wore leggings). As is usually the case with these costume-type things, it looked really cheap and everything was see-through. It worked in a pinch but only because I had to make it work."
2.0,It was made too small had to give it to somebody smaller than me
2.0,Wore them for 1.5 months....then the strap broke.
2.0,The dress didn't  fit anything  like it looked in the picture. I did like the fabric though.
2.0,"This magnet is adorable, but the hole is too small to fit my glasses and even though I haven't used them, I'm unable to return them, which is very disappointing. These will only fit glasses with very small sides."
2.0,"Comfortable band, good for when exercising. I'd have given it 4 stars after the first couple of days off using it.<br /><br />However, after a couple of weeks of use, there is a notch on both of the rubber loops that makes it incredibly annoying to put the watch on.  Everytime it's a battle to get the wrist strap through each loop with no other way but to just yank on the band until it forcibly makes it past the notch.  With a watch that needs to be charged daily it is just not worth the battle every single day. Switching to another band, keeping this one as a last reserve. Would not recommended."
2.0,"My mom loved the ring and said it was beautiful, the problem is I order the earings!"
2.0,"I love Reebok swimsuits.  They are great coverage for older women.  This one, however, has very deep cut armholes and shows too much flesh.  Very disappointing."
2.0,"Return, not quality I thought."
2.0,Great concept as I love the organization in packing these provide.  Don’t spend extra on the ultras.  On first use one of the big one started to rip and I don’t believe I overpacked it.
2.0,"These glasses are very misleading not the strength I ordered, very disappointed. Do not water your money"
2.0,"I like the material and all the storage....however as we were packing my husbands suit BOTH zippers popped right off. Shoddy zipper job. It still worked, just wont close. Get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,"I ordered two different colors and returned both:<br /><br />BlkA12: I loved the design of this color and the material was very comfortable but it was way too big. I am a size 8/10  with a bra size of 34/36A  and I first ordered this in medium and it hung really loosely under the arms and I look like I was wearing a sack. I returned it for a small and still had the same problem, so I am returning this and am done.<br /><br />ORNA6: This one actually fit normally in the chest area, but the waist band sits in a weird place and it starts to ride up over my bra, probably because I am small chested. Also the color orange is a little darker then what is shown (tried to take a pic but the color doesn't translate). Overall the only thing I like on this one was the sleeves."
2.0,Dislike. Used for my smart watch
2.0,"Works only slightly to stiffen a canvas,  western-style hat."
2.0,"I didn't have high expectations for the price that was paid, but i expected more than a quarter machine quality necklace."
2.0,"The watch looks great and seems to work, I'm returning it because the rotating bezel is so loose it rattles when I move my hand.<br />For the price I was not expecting to get a Breitling, but a watch is not supposed to rattle, even if it was only a $36 watch."
2.0,The tie die shirt come exactly how it looks but the material is thicker than what you expect. It doesn’t fit very flattering because of the thickness of the material and it’s very long. It also runs big. I got a medium but fits like a large.
2.0,Bought these for a boyfriend and they barely lasted a day. the clasp broke almost immediately
2.0,Bulgy n the back
2.0,Did not fit my boyfriend's face at all.
2.0,"I was super excited to get these, but the earring post was thicker than the usual earring which caused my piercing to sting me while they were in until 3 hrs later I took them out. They also stuck out oddly on my ears-- didn't like how they looked on me. However they are pretty and clasp tightly, so I'll give it 2 stars even though I wont wear them again."
2.0,Love the top until I realized when you put it on it’s so oddly cut and shorter in the back.
2.0,"Thin material, super wrinkly and looked kind of cheap"
2.0,Cute design and very soft.  My son absolutely loves it.  The low review is because we've only had it for about two weeks and it has a large hole in it where the hood attaches to the robe.  Should be better quality for the price.
2.0,I read the size chart carefully that display for this item when I was purchasing it yet the shirt that arrived was too small.
2.0,"I was on the Izipizi bandwagon when I first tried on a pair. Cool looking glasses that don't cost a bomb.  I bought 3 pair.  HOWEVER, they are all broken after just 1 year. Seems they break at the hinge very easily.  I had to go back to my $5 pair that I bought on Amazon that seem indestructible because I have had them for nearly 2 years.  If you have money to burn buy them  As a matter of fact, buy 2 for when the first pair breaks."
2.0,I was attracted by the look of the product and in this respect I am not disappointed. In three more respects though' I am dissatisfied for 3 reasons:<br />1. size: I ordered 8 and received  7<br />2. the faux-fur lining falls off; my bedroom carpet is full of fluff<br />3. the faux-fur lining induces sweating of my soles (feet)
2.0,"The shoes are cute, but like many say the strap don’t stay tighten, wore them to a Christmas party and I had to tighten them about five times. The shoes not comfortable at all, it just to walk in looking cute then take them off because your feet will start to hurt, so would I wear them again probably not, If I can return I would."
2.0,"they dont fit me welll my thighs are to tight and my waist is to big, im not a big girl my boddy type is hourglass, I think they would fit better other body types"
2.0,Order 2 sizes larger than you'd think. I'm a women's large and ordered the XL and it just fit me. This shirt is really cute but needs to be a bit baggy to look right. Think junior sizes and up one more size
2.0,Beautiful delicate band but the clasp is difficult to close. I couldn't do it! I realized that a double clasp (like the one on my Skagen) is the way to go with mesh bands. This is only a single clasp that wouldn't close for me.
2.0,"Pretty, understated design. I truly like these earrings but they are made of very cheap materials and were tarnished after wearing them twice. Attempts to clean have so far been unsuccessful. Understandable that they are advertised as bridesmaids' jewelry, as they actually would be a good choice if you only expect to wear them once."
2.0,"Super cute, but the elastic band started falling apart soon after we got them. We have a bunch of Vaenait Baby briefs, as well as boxer briefs, and this seems to happen to some but not others. The ones that are not printed (e.g., like the color-block ones) seem to be better quality: the elastic band holds up, and the fabric is thicker and softer."
2.0,"My daughter usually wears a 10, so I ordered a 12 just in case we needed alterations.<br />The dress didn’t zip because it was way too small."
2.0,i bought two wallets and only received one
2.0,Thin material. I don’t care for things I can see my underwear through.
2.0,"I loved the color and quality of this wallet, but the snap closures on the front (There are two), don't match up.  You can only snap one shut at a time.  They are not even close to hitting the mark.  Really disappointing.  Aside from that, it is very nice."
2.0,Received for Christmas 2018.  Made 2 trips in 2019 and extension handle will not raise or lower.
2.0,Only 1 earring in the order. Price high for what is received. Very small.
2.0,"I purchased, got here fast. Is really not sheer as shown."
2.0,"I'm very disappointed in this purchase. When I opened the package and saw the size of the pendant I was very surprised. Like most people, i looked at the picture and thought this is really nice.  However, the picture is very misleading...The pendant was so tiny I was barely able to make out the skull's face, which is a shame because the artwork is very nice.  Going forward I will be more cautious of demensions."
2.0,I really loved it but after a week the clip broke. Guess I got what I paid for.
2.0,too thin and too short for the price
2.0,Hat is way to be big didn’t wear it!
2.0,Shiny weird material- cute pattern and nice dress but just an ugly cheap fabric.
2.0,So cheap looking and falls apart.
2.0,You can buye one dress in 3 different colors and all 3 dresses area different material
2.0,The preview of what our headband would look like was a bright lime green.  It turned out dark hunter green and it is hard to see that name.
2.0,Nice colour & fabric but runs small in the arms-chest area. Disappointed that I had to pay for return shipping from this seller.
2.0,"It's way longer than I anticipated, and the waistband material is cheap and so it doesn't stay on my waist unless I fold it over a couple times, which then makes it look like I've got extra and lumpy fat rolls."
2.0,this stuff comes in a nice box and looks pretty neat but it's a horrible reproduction from the show. the words and written the wrong way and are raised instead of depressed like they were scratched in. its meant to be read vertically from the loop instead of horizontally like it is in the show. its cheap and looks alright but not for a true fan of the show.
2.0,We bought this toy for our 8 year old son for Christmas.  All his friends in the area (within 2 miles) were getting it too.  He has been disappointed time and time again.  He added all his friends to his buddy list and so far the only one he can talk to lives directly across the street from us.  His best friend is two blocks away and is not in range.  This toy was a total waste of money and should be named CHAT NEVER!!!
2.0,"These bracelets are cute, which is why I bought them in the first place.<br /><br />BUT after wearing the bracelets for less than 24 hours, the gold beads lost their shine!! The pics show what they looked like when I put them on in the morning versus what they looked like when I came home that evening.<br /><br />Cheap quality. Use better gold beads and try again.<br /><br />Find another set of bracelets to spend your money on!"
2.0,"Apparently they do not include the tool mentioned in the description, should have ordered it from the other vendor. Now I have to go get one or head to the jewelry store."
2.0,The hole for the chain is kind of small
2.0,Fits weird. I’m 5’7 1/2 and 132lbs. The sleeves on this jacket are too short. There is also no give to this jacket meaning it doesn’t stretch at all it’s very fitted but fits weird. It’s also not Sherpa.
2.0,all the other review said this item was too small but i look like a big fat ass in these overalls they not at all flatering. i wont even wear them around the house they are bulky in all the wrong places!
2.0,"Not made very well at all.  Buckles in places it shouldn't.  Not a very good cut and the feaux wrap, is too obvious."
2.0,"I bought these water shoes knowing my daughter would only wear once for an upcoming trip and based on the quality, that's what we will get. Don't buy these if you expect them to last awhile."
2.0,"Very pretty strap, and it makes my Pebble time look great, but it feels uncomfortable and cheap. Even at its tightest, it doesn't go small enough to fit my wrist snugly, so my watch slides up and down my arm with this strap. The buckle is awful and getting this strap off is a challenge. It takes me a few minutes of prying to remove it every night. Also, the spring bars are sold separately, so tack on another $6 for your purchase if you want this strap to be usable. Not recommended.."
2.0,At best these are junior sizes. Probably more like a child’s large. They were in the plus sizes I ordered an extra large. And couldn’t get them over my knee
2.0,"It's authentic and no problems with the seller whatsoever, it's just that the picture doesn't do the purse justice and it's fairly floppy and ugly. The hardware is barely visible and it's awkward to carry."
2.0,These earrings are not the quality that I am used to. The color is full and the product has a plastic look.
2.0,I was sooooo excited about these shoes to wear to graduation and before I even left the house I started forming a blister on both of my big toes. I am not the one to complain about heels or even take them off in pain but this day I was struggling. I would suggest maybe going up in a size? But even then I’m not sure if that would help. Ugh loved these shoes so much too! I
2.0,"I wear a ex large in the USA size and that's what I ordered. I had to send them my measurements. The material is not what I expected, thin and wrinkles easily<br />beautiful color<br />.<br />."
2.0,"They are like plastic, served the purpose for a one time wear...not wearing them again."
2.0,Not very strong. Cracked at the base.
2.0,The material is for swimming suit. Not for ballet. And it has a rubber band smell.
2.0,The pants tore just by putting my phone in my pocket. Wtf
2.0,"I ordered the cream-colored hoodie and I love the feel, but unfortunately, the coloring came out to be so much brighter than depicted on Amazon. It looks more yellow than cream. I guess I won't be wearing it outdoors anymore which is unfortunate."
2.0,"As others wrote, the lights on one shoe broke after about 2 weeks.  Cute, but not worth the money."
2.0,Didn't even wear it. Doesn't look as good as pic or maybe you just have to look like the model in the pic. Will be returning
2.0,Even though I order same size some fit and some do not
2.0,This was a gift to friend and then we found that it had a hole so we had to return. But they had really cool colors.
2.0,This earring was not what I expected. It constantly got stuck in my hair and was very harsh and sharp on the ends. Spend the extra cash and get a better quality
2.0,Due to fit I am positive that this will be a one and done wearing experience.
2.0,"Well, &#34;what you expected from sunglasses below 4usd?&#34; asked my wife.<br />This ones seems like a children's toy. The glass is not so much mirrored as the picture, the plastic is very light.<br />A good choice for a costume party."
2.0,A little rough
2.0,I was anticipating pink. It was more an orange/peach.
2.0,"These shorts are tight in the thigh area. The waist and the overall length are perfect.<br /><br />I suppose if I received a larger waist size, it would loosen in the thigh area, but then it would be bunched up around the belt. Hence, there’s not a good solution here to make it work…<br /><br />Overall, I really wanted these shorts to be just right for packing on my outdoor adventures. The material is thick, to which I think it would hold up under the more unusual situations that come up while being outdoors, like slipping down a hill and sliding on your butt! I wouldn’t think that they would rip, based on the material, if they did, it would be because of the tight fit in the thighs, and for that reason, I wouldn’t wear them as intended. They are for fashion only and not utility. It’s disappointing, they didn't make it into the outdoor equipment gear pack…"
2.0,"Not all the lights came on, the package was damaged, came a day before the party so we had to use what we could."
2.0,"great for temporary use, most of the ball screws broke within a few days"
2.0,I wonder how many people who  need these are able to put them on.  I am not.
2.0,"The pictures are deceptive!! Read the comments everything they say is true. I'm not returning mine, probably just find someone to give it to. Totally bummed when it arrived. I had such plans to enjoy it this all fall season, built a whole cute outfit around it. It's so thin, you'd be just as good going shirtless in a blizzard. 👍. Save your money, find something else. 😔"
2.0,They aren’t water resistant at all. I use them twice to put chains on for the semi. The black coating bleeds thru onto my skin. Finger tips and gloves aren’t soaked but have a damp feeling to them.<br />Durability they seem so far as good gloves. Able to was them as well
2.0,This mask is way too thin and flimsy.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:473e9f9ad2a72b4ee555be503f7a3474]] The ring is supposed to be silver but I've worn it for about 3 weeks now and the silver is wearing off and turning like a rose gold color (but not a pretty rose gold) it is very pretty when new but I wouldn't buy it again.
2.0,I got this jacket as a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday and it fit him perfect but after 2wks the buttons popped out! He was so mad and I was to!! Coat looks nice but is cheap material!
2.0,"This bag is big, but it's also heavier mesh.  It's not heavy to carry (by itself), but the thicker mesh makes it hard to fold up.  It doesn't get compact, so it's not that great for traveling."
2.0,After 30 days they stretched out of shape . They won't fit right after 30 days
2.0,"Very cute, just like the pic. But large is VERY SMALL."
2.0,FYI: 2 bears means 1 momma  bear and 1 cub..I ordered &#34;2&#34;. I thought I was getting 1 bear and 2 cubs. You can't have a momma bear without atleast 1 cub? One would think the momma bear would be a given...and the question would be how many cubs? I was wrong! Nice necklace but misleading. Lesson learned!
2.0,"This product was not mesh, it was cotton and not as expected"
2.0,Kinda riskeee! Like needed pants.
2.0,Wasn’t flattering
2.0,Very very cheaply made! I was hesitant on even ordering it. And when I got it I was not suprised when I saw it. It did however arrive very fast. That's the reason it got 2 stars.. that and my 14 year old daughter like the box it came in..
2.0,I found them difficult to insert in the ear.
2.0,"These slide down my babies legs, or they slide to the side. They seem to cut off circulation and hurt my baby. I asked my pediatrician if these were necessary and gave me the first time mom buying needless crap look. He said babies have knees made for crawling and falling on everything from carpet to hard surfaces. These really aren't necessary. They didn't work, anyway."
2.0,No es muy buena calidad
2.0,"I purchased this handbag just under a month ago. I do like the style, shape and size. I also like that it is a bag that stands up on its own and doesn't slouch.<br /> The reason for the two stars is that the long, over-the-shoulder strap, broke today. The metal carabiner on the strap itself, that clips onto the purse just snapped in half while wearing the bag. I think the metal clip should last longer than a month.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, the strap broke in the dirtiest of dirty stairwells at a parking garage. As soon as it snapped, the bag flipped upside down and landed on a stair, and everything that was in the bag bounced down an entire flight of dirty concrete stairs.<br />I did not have the bag over-loaded; it's the same contents I've kept in every handbag I've had, and I have not had this happen to any other bag."
2.0,Nice looking but too large
2.0,"Not very high waisted! I’d call it a medium-rise. Higher than typical bikini bottoms, but not high. Hits at the belly button and I’m short…it fits OK otherwise, but see my photos. The colors are WAY OFF. Some heinous green instead of the teal shown. I know it states some colors might be different but this is wayyyy off. Disappointing!"
2.0,Fit seemed a bit strange and I wasn’t nuts about the feel of the material. Almost felt see through from the light color in some spots. Still haven’t found an occasion where I felt comfortable to wear it out to.
2.0,I’m usually a medium but I ordered an XL and it’s still not “oversized”. It’s cute! Love the washout look. But definitely order at LEAST 2X up.<br />UPDATE: the design isn’t even centered lol
2.0,"Color was not what I expected, looks very cheap."
2.0,Fabric is stiffer/rougher than I thought it would be.
2.0,"The bust and sleeves were very small. I couldn't even get them over my shoulders and I wear a size 6 small/medium normally but I am 5ft 9 1/2 inches tall. The bodice part of the dress was very baggy and there was no modesty flap behind the lacing. Otherwise, dress was well made and the detail was great especially considering the price.  I will have to replace the bust and sleeve part of the dress in order to wear it."
2.0,Not a big fan of this dress.<br />I ordered it to attend court one day and it is completely see-through.
2.0,"I wasn't too impressed with the lace trimmings. the white cover up came with blue trimming, and the black cover up had grey trimmings, and had a whole in the trimming. Cute cute. the trimmings should have matched the color of the cover ups."
2.0,They fell apart literally as soon as I opened the packaging. Very disappointed.
2.0,Belts are nice but the buckles don’t fit through your belt loops
2.0,I always wear a medium....however this top is so large around the neck and shoulders that it doesn't set right.  I would need to take up an inch and a half or two inches from the top to the bottom to get the shoulder/neck area to sit right.
2.0,"The actual band looks great, if had a nice heavy feel to it and the finish goes excellent with the black moto 360. However, it broke the same day I received it. I used the included tool to remove two links and when I tried to out the watch on I noticed the locking mechanism was broken. I don't know if I received a defect or its just a cheap lock. I was able to use my ifix it kit to at least lock with some extra pressure but it still gets loose and falls of my wrist. It's a shame because the band looks great."
2.0,Fits tight around mouth
2.0,"This item didn't fit like the sizing chart said.  Extremely tight around breasts and shoulder width did not span my shoulders like it does in the picture.  Needless to say, it did nothing for my posture and felt uncomfortable.  I also experienced issues with delivery.  However, I must say returning the item was more convenient that I expected."
2.0,Perfect size<br />Very flimsy
2.0,The sleeves are tight and it doesn't close good. It won't hang on you like the image. You may want to order a size up.
2.0,"Look very nice, but way too small for nipplerings."
2.0,"The arm length on this sweater was perfect but unfortunately the length overall was very small, The front sides of the sweater although they look long as featured in the image, did not go past my hip. Im 5'7 and 150lbs and ordered a medium. A real bummer cause I loved the pattern on the arms."
2.0,Ordered for a Christmas gift. It came bent in on one side and very flimsy.  Unfortunately it was too late before Christmas to send back.  Would not recommend.
2.0,"I ordered xl ,white, long sleeve, leopard -black stripe top. I really liked the style but the length is too short, fit right (order two sizes up).  The neckline is 1/2 mock and  gapes.  I returned it.<br />Note:  If you normally wear petite clothing the length should work for you."
2.0,I got the white one. It's a cute dress but even at 5'2&#34; it was too short for me and also VERY see-though. You'd need a stick on bra or strapless and short Spanx shorts. The print was really pretty but I had to return it since I need something longer for my event.
2.0,"Got these July 31 2022 and as of September 4th 2022 the stitching is already coming undone. Nice shorts, but useless if they only last a month!"
2.0,The rose is just to big for my taste!
2.0,"These pants arrived ripped and ripped further when I tried to put them on.  I've purchased a few pairs from this store, which were great, but these were not."
2.0,listed as women made for Jr's or smaller.
2.0,This shirt was really nice and it fits my style of dressing I was really happy when I bought it but when I recived it I was disappointed by the size it was I ordered a 3xl and recived what fit me like a large the good thing was I returned the item amd I got a refund back so that was a good thing well if you want a tip here it is make sure that you're buying American made with American sizes rather than an Asian size it tricks many of us
2.0,"I ordered these gloves on a recommendation from my brother in-law. The seller has now changed, after my order was placed. The gloves that I received are not the same as depicted and don't fit as well as his pair."
2.0,"I guess I will continue my search for a good fleece jacket under $50.00. The Colorado Timberline Telluride isn't it. First was that it was quite a bit larger than a large. But the size I could tolerate. Second, it wasn't a heavy fleece. But the few times I wore it outdoors it did keep me warm enough. But when the zipper refused to close after only a couple of weeks, it went straight to the trash. It was absolutely useless. Don't waste your money with this one."
2.0,The legs were not very flattering on me...
2.0,"Too big, too rigid."
2.0,my grandson ordered. He loves hats.
2.0,"They are hit or miss. Some hold up while others turn green in a matter of a few hours of wearing them. If I were you, I wouldn't bother with these... it's pretty gross..."
2.0,Showed discoloring within the first week.
2.0,"The watch itself is pretty but the band is so cheap, it is made out of very flexible rubber and mine tore off from the watch itself."
2.0,"The mask is not a one size fits all, seems to be made very cheap, and does not fit properly"
2.0,"Very disappointed in this. The waste line is so weird and cuts you in half. It fit normal, just gave me an odd shape. I would never wear this. Nope."
2.0,Shrinks after one wash.  Collar isn’t sewn down
2.0,"After 30 years in the US Army, there’s no novelty for me in wearing camouflage. However, I now spend much of my time photographing wildlife, so I want to get any edge on the fauna. (The birds and animals are probably more concerned with movement than color, but just in case.)<br /><br />The shirt seems to be made of two different materials. The torso is a soft clinging material and the arms and shoulders are more like a light canvas. There are a number of features most of which are impractical. The pockets on the arms are so high up that it’s hard to slide something into them. The elaborate sleeve closures might be useful in cold weather, but the shirt seems to be designed as an outer garment. There are slots in the sleeves for elbow pads but I’m not certain what kind of elbow pads could fit in the long thin slots. The sleeves seem like they might be designed to ward off brush but the torso just invites clingy branches; perhaps the designers envisioned wearing a vest over the shirt. The sleeves are scratchy unless you wear something underneath, but if you do, you will need a larger shirt.<br /><br />The sleeves were so rigid that I thought washing the shirt would help to make them softer and more comfortable. I followed the laundering directions to a tee. The shirt shrunk by about one size.<br /><br />Overall, I think I will not use this shirt when I am in the field. Some other folks may find a cool factor."
2.0,Wore for a few days color darkened on the pendant and my skin was getting irritated.  Good for occasions not daily wear
2.0,I ordered a 3x. The same size I buy in Walmart. It’s so tight I could pass out. And it’s a 3X!! It like a Xl. Not happy at all
2.0,I purchased the lilac colored tunic and I love it so I purchased the wine color but even after 3 washes it still had an awful smell...I hope the other solid colors don’t have the same Oder because I’d love to get the black one.
2.0,The hats are good but the blowouts don't make any noise!! I'm so disappointed that the party is this weekend and I got 2 packs of these blowouts that are of no use!
2.0,Quality socks but I wanted the multi-color bikes on black socks as shown in the picture and stated in the product description: &#34;This is an Part 2 to the previous Cool Bikes version. Same 3 inch cuff as normal. Just adding more vibrant Hi-Vis Colors.&#34; What was shipped are socks that are black and white with some dark blue. No Hi-Vis colors as described.
2.0,"Cracked frame within two months. They were a gift for my boyfriend who always puts them in the cloth pouch they came with when he’s not wearing them and the frame is already cracked right through to the lens. The lens scratched easily as well. Extremely disappointed with the quality as they looked great and had good reviews. Perfect style and color, but they don’t hold up. Too late to return now."
2.0,"Not a bad belt, but the biggest problem is the leather loop. It is one color (brown) and doesn't really look good when you reverse the belt. That is if you can find it. The loop is not attached to the belt so as soon as you hang it up, it'll just slide off and become a play toy for your animals. I've already had to rescue mine twice. The reversible part actually looks nicer if you un-clamp the leather belt from the buckle and then clamp it on with the other side showing rather than using the part of the buckle that rotates."
2.0,The sleeves were not the same width all the way down. It was so tight at elbows that it cut into my arms when I bent them. I wish it would have been sized correctly.
2.0,The long sleeve shirt is too small.
2.0,"I usually wear a medium but order a large. The large fit like a small. The lace was different than the picture, cheaper looking. But it was still a cute skirt. I'm giving this one to my cousin and ordering myself an xl. Hopefully it will fit."
2.0,"I wanted a light brownish lens, as shown. But it's a pure yellow lens that works best in overcast light."
2.0,"I did a test with an oscilloscope to see how much voltage from power line hum (60 hz) would be shunted to ground wearing these. I carefully installed them according to directions and stood under fluorescent lights over a cement floor with thin vinyl tiles on it. They seemed to reduce the voltage on my skin by some 20% or less. (bare feet reduce the voltage by 39%) Also I tested the resistance from the outside pad to the inside pad and it came in at 850,000 ohms! That is incredibly high for a product that is supposed to be shunting signals to ground. I could do better with some copper wire and aluminum mesh screen. They look great but I am honestly a little disappointed in the actual performance."
2.0,Love this charm but the heart fell off a few days after purchased.
2.0,"Pretty, but the opal feel right out in the packaging."
2.0,They are light weight.  They are also itchy and uncomfortable and they have an unpleasant odor.
2.0,The tulle sleeve is very cute but the dress is made by a poor material.
2.0,ordered 2 of these one of which arrived with the clamp broken off and the second one the clamp snapped off after half day at the beach. Bad design with plastic threads that hold the umbrella stem to the clamp. Weak spot in design! Nice color though!
2.0,Too small and the strap broke as soon as I went to tie it. You get what you pay for!
2.0,"The fit is all wrong.  Mittens are huge for my 20 month old.  Can’t even get them in - too big and bulky.  They would pull up over half his arm, but they’re not wide enough to go over the coat.  Can’t fit them under....<br />Otherwise, they seem like a good quality.  I will see if they fit better next year."
2.0,These are so tiny and they look even tinier in...
2.0,Too thin and a polyester fabric.
2.0,Big dissappointment. Should have bought HANES!
2.0,Poor quality and had frayed stitching
2.0,I wanted it to be fuzzy and warm and it’s not. It’s a very scratchy fabric
2.0,shrink when washed
2.0,I checked the size before i ordered but the jacket was way too small than the chart shows.
2.0,My son wears a 10/12. I ordered the XL 14/16 so he would have plenty of room to wear something under it. It is so extremely small it will not pull above his thighs and the jacket will not close enough to button.  The tags say XL but fit like a boys size 8.
2.0,Cute purse but the closure was made very cheap and ended up falling off.
2.0,Chain was to thin broke in one hour
2.0,This does not look anything like the pic. This looks like a cheap faux pewter with silver paint. No details like shown in the pic.
2.0,"Watch worked for some time then the digital displays went off,  I can be the battery twice but it did not work. The regular non digital works ok but not the digital displays. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress because it’s easy to thrown on and I liked the drawstring.  However, the pockets stick out and made me look awkward in it."
2.0,Not what I expected.  Always looks wrinkled.  Would not recommend it.
2.0,The quality of the garment was less than expected.
2.0,Ordered perfectly for my body size and so the dress is way too tight around my chest and arms and the material is too stiff and so I can barely move in it! I will probably be donating it!
2.0,"Thin fabric and cute, but the main problem is that the cat transfers on the knees peel and rip. This happened on the first day my daughter wore them!  You can peel them off and I will most likely do this, but it is a bummer because the cats are what my daughter liked.  Also, you can see light through the fabric when you hold it up to a light source, so it is on the thin side; These pants are more like leggings, definitely not pants for winter months."
2.0,"I love this robe!  It's just exactly what I wanted, but...two snaps have already pulled and I think there are more that can easily come out.  I don't know what to do about it, or if I'm just stuck with it.  Please respond!!!"
2.0,The fit of these boxer shorts is not accurate.  Size Large (34-36) fits like it should be a medium.  I have a 34 waist and these boxers are tight like a brief.
2.0,Cool colors but don't stay on
2.0,"This is a beautiful necklace. It looks amazing on. But, I think, I wore it maybe 3-4 times and the color started tarnishing already."
2.0,"It's pretty for the price, but arrived broken :("
2.0,"Update September: the band has ripped between the hole I use and the one wider. This has made the band unusable and I’ve updated my star rating to 2 stars as the band is now unusable. I really enjoyed the band for the 3-4 months I had it but I expected better durability from this band.  I didn’t wear the band every day but I wore it a lot and I wore it for all sorts of activities.<br />**<br />Update July: after wearing this band almost every day for a month I’ve noticed that the hole I use had ripped a little and that the metal clasp becomes hot on the skin on hot days.<br />For these reason I docked a star down to 4 stars. Band still functions as it should.<br />****<br />This band is adorable! On top of that it’s super comfortable!<br />The packaging is classic Kate Spade!<br />On first inspection the band seemed very thick. It’s so comfortable I’m going to say it’s a perfect thickness.<br />It holds up amazing to everyday where, high intensity workouts, and getting wet (showers & swimming).<br />I’ve never lost connection during a workout activity as I have with other bands that don’t fit as well.<br />I don’t think my wrist retains sweat as much as it does with cheaper silicone watch bands.<br />I have fairly small wrists and I usually end up on the last hole or struggle to get a good fit.<br />With this band I have 3 holes left!<br />The color is great and the scalloping is right on trend!<br />It fits my 38mm Apple Watch perfectly. My husband has a 40mm watch band and I felt like it looked a little strange on there since the connectors didn’t go to the edges - but it was securely in place and would definitely work.<br />The connectors and buckle are shiny silver but don’t seem to show dirt or fingerprints.<br />This is a high quality watch band that can be worn daily dressed up or down."
2.0,"These are nice gloves, well made, but very very snug. I wear a 7.5 in sterile gloves, and I can force my hands into them,  but they are tight. Keeping them because a cold front is coming."
2.0,"They didn't fit as expected,not the panty for me,maybe for others"
2.0,Too tight for my 6 year old daughter to get on. I ordered her a size 10 (she is tall and lean wears size 8 pants and size 7 tops). I would say it would have fit but because she struggled to put it on dry I decided to return it. She complained it was too tight getting on. Imagine you are at the beach on a family trip when it’s time to get out of the wet bathing suit or go to the bathroom. If you have a delicate flower like our 6 year old you know where this is going. We avoid melt downs at all costs this would be one of them. We ended up getting a UV Skinz rash guard set (long sleeve and skort bottom).
2.0,Sizes were confusing - asked for British size 12 (American size 8) - received American size 12 (British size 16)<br />Returning but want to order correct size - help...... i initially asked for size 12 (states British)
2.0,Just took this out of the package. It is very sheer and the crocheting is wripped in a few places. I am 8 1/2 months pregnant and this definitely fits like maternity clothing! I need this cover up for a pool party this afternoon and have no choice but to keep it. Not very happy with the quality at all. Should cost more like $13.00.
2.0,MIrror was damaged as a result of the packaging/handling. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Wish I would have read the reviews before making the purchase, it does run about 2 sizes too small. It did fit my kid, little snug but ultimately she just cared that it has her favorite characters on it.<br /><br />The other reason for the low rating is the design on it appears to be an ironed on piece. Between that and how small the sweater ran we will have to be careful with washing and drying so it doesn't shrink or design melt off.<br /><br />Wouldn't buy again or attempt to return as other reviewers have mentioned they won't refund or give partial only. Not worth the trouble."
2.0,"Overall dress is cute. The color was nice and it fit well. However, the button at the neck was missing from the once side and it had a stain on it."
2.0,"I did not like these laces very much. They were difficult to lace up and I don’t like the idea of “tucking” the excess into the shoe. Just and FYI, Nathan’s are much more user friendly."
2.0,It fits somewhat large and the colour doesnt look as the image...a different shade.
2.0,It is big on me and you can see bra on sides . Definitely have to wear undershirt<br /><br />I am a 40D 170 lbs 5’6<br /><br />Got an XL recommended .prob should have done a large
2.0,"Bought this for my daughter. I loved the top, but the bottom was too revealing in the back for me. Didn’t see that it would be a problem from the photos."
2.0,"Really ugly buttons, no details on the pockets as shown in the photos. Takes forever to come. Fabric isn’t denim."
2.0,"Shirt is cute, however it is a crop top.  Not as pictured."
2.0,"This shirt is TINY! The shirt is beautiful, but there is no way anyone over 100lbs could wear a medium. The fabric has zero give. I am super disappointed because I really do love the shirt, but I don't think I could even fit in a 2x with how off the sizing is."
2.0,Cute necklace but lost it’s color after one wear.
2.0,The suit I received was different from the pictures. There was a huge thick band seam around the middle of the suit that isn't visible in the pictures.
2.0,"The stitching on the inner thigh is kinda hard/harsh, and rubs a little uncomfortably. The inner leg already has a hole from where the stitching broke through the fabric and pulled away. BUT the length is ideal, and the waistband is decently comfy. I don't use the pockets because if you put a phone in the phone bumps around and threatens to slip out as soon as you start running"
2.0,The material is nice and the fit is as I expected.  however the seam at the waist is crooked and the bottom hem is about an inch longer on one side.
2.0,"The style of this dress was cute, but the material was really thin and cheap feeling. I had to return it."
2.0,Very thin!!
2.0,No problem with the fit but around the band at the top of the sock it cause me to itch because of the wool I imagine and it was too tight possibly. So if you have sensitive skin it may not be good for you.
2.0,After wearing these for 2 weeks I went back to my old shoes.  I had more foot pain than ever with these shoes even after removing one or more of the plugs in the heel.
2.0,"These are decent to look through, but they are the most cheaply made frail glasses I have ever owned. I would purchase if I had to do it over.  Being half frame, they feel exactly like the safety glasses you buy at Home Depot for $20."
2.0,No this didn't it didn't work out for what I wanted it to. And the zipper is already broken :(
2.0,"Ordered 6 pairs of these socks.  3 pair were Black and are perfect.  I absolutely love them.  The other 3 pair were supposed to be Dark GRAY and were actually BLUE.  I returned the BLUE socks and ordered DARK GRAY.  Again I was sent blue.  At this point the frustration level is thru the roof.  Either someone thinks blue and dark gray are the same color, or the item is mislabeled.  Either way I have returned yet another 3 pair.  I will say the return process with Amazon is very simple."
2.0,Not very loud.  3 hr battery life
2.0,"I love the weight of these cubes and purchased them several trips ago. However, they CANNOT be washed. After several month-long international trips and other places, I wash all items including packing cubes that have been a bit of everywhere. With other brands, I've tossed them in a gentle wash cycle and they came out fine. However these are covered with white stringy stuff. Structurally they are fine, but not sure I will want to use them and now I know I can't wash other cubes in the system...disappointed."
2.0,I can’t even setup the time
2.0,Cute necklace but it made my neck green :(
2.0,"it indicated cotton, however it is not cotton!!!.....the colors are great........it is smaller than indicated"
2.0,I ordered this item for Halloween. It came the day after. The skirt is well made and beautiful but ran small.
2.0,"The colors and quality were great.  However, the coverage of the bottom was little more than a thong.  Not appropriate for a 15 year old."
2.0,"Ordered 2- 1 works, 1 doesn’t. The one that does is exactly what was needed. Unfortunately, 2 were needed for my idea to work. I️ was going to return but shipping is more than I️ paid."
2.0,This &#34;ukulele&#34; strap is huge! I'm having to cut the adjustable straps and re-sew them so I can adjust to the size I need for the ukulele. It fits comfortably around my neck...that's the only reason I'm keeping it. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn't want to have to alter it.
2.0,They do not stay on.  Had to send them back
2.0,It's a man's tshirt
2.0,Looks like toy glasses. Find something better.
2.0,"Doesn't look like the picture, looks pretty cheep."
2.0,The best part was the pockets but other than that the description says order a size up definitely order 2 sizes up incredibly thin and they keep rolling dow n
2.0,"It was nice soft leather an looked well made but it looked nothing like the picture an it was a thin jacket instead of thick winter coat. They said go 1 size up because they ran small, so I ordered XL, it fits a 8 year old. I sent it back rite away an I'm waiting for my refund of  $138.00. This is the 3rd time this has happened, its not worth the hassel and long wait to get it cheaper from overseas."
2.0,"I LOVE this suit, but I'm not tall at all (not quite 5&#34;5&#34;), and it's too short for my torso... Very disappointed because it's ADORABLE!!!!!"
2.0,"Did not receive the correct color shoes. The tread on the shoes is slippery on a bare floor. Other than that, quality is decent. Major reduction is stars for wrong product being delivered."
2.0,I could only get one of the zippers to come up on the side.
2.0,"I bought several clothes from modernmiss. I loved them all except this one. The real dress I got is not as bright as the picture, it's more dull/dirty look. I didn't have time to return yet, probably not since it's kind of hassle to me. But I will be more careful next time."
2.0,To small. Hard to put on by yourself
2.0,Nice shirt but runs extremely small. The 3x was more like a large-xlarge.
2.0,This is completely see through. The sizing is way off.  I wouldn't waste my time even if the sizing was TTS bc it is soooo thin and see through unless maybe you were wearing it as a swimsuit cover up.
2.0,The robe is great quality however it is a bit heavy which is hard for women recovering and may feel weak. Different wish material was more lite weight
2.0,Not a big comfy sweater as advertised
2.0,Ok so yes this shirt is ok if you want to win a wet t-shirt contest but not if you don't want the world to see your upper body. It is made with a very soft very light cotton. The screen print reminds me of one that you print off then iron on to your shirt. Like a DIY project. It's cute and funny. However I'd like to be able to NOT see through my clothes. Even my husband will not wear it because of how see through it is. I just think for 20$ i could get a MUCH higher quality shirt.<br /><br />I received this shirt free for my honest opinion of it.
2.0,the slip underneath cause dress to bunch at the hips. The back view was nothing like the pic. Quality ok for price
2.0,I'm a size medium and I felt like I should have got a large. Definitely runs a size smaller. Also the slit up the side was a little too high for my liking
2.0,This dress makes me realize how big I am. Very thin fabric on the bottom. It's very good if you want people to see what color undies you are wearing and to see your bellybutton through your clothes.
2.0,"The skirt came up to high. Torso section of fabric not as long as shown in image. Had to return, literally looks like I'm pregnant in this dress. Wish the torso/top material hit at mid-waist as shown on the model or else I would've kept it. Fabric is also pretty heavy, better suited for fall/winter weather."
2.0,I'm giving this 2 stars for quality.  Bought for my 15 year old grand daughter. My 7 year old granddaughter is more likely to fit in this.
2.0,"They were not what I thought they would be. I thought they would really be working lighters. My son saw them (one that really worked) in another ad online, and I was so excited to have found them on Amazon ordered them. They were for his 16th birthday in a week. I ordered them around Christmas time and with the busyness of Christmas time I didn't take time to look at them till the other day, I just hide them in a safe spot. Sadly I realized they just look like lighters and its to late to return them. I should of looked closer...it really stinks... because I was super excited to give them to him and also stinks because I can't get my $ back.<br />---<br />Mom FAIL"
2.0,The manufacturing quality isn't that great. Looks like cheap material and is not true to size. It fits 1-2 sizes bigger.
2.0,"This was the correct size, but because there is zero stretch, it was too small for my curvy frame. The top is cut narrow, so excessive side boob is an issue, and because of where the straps are connected at the neckline, it pulls the fabric taut, creating a quad boob. Not suitable for soft curvy women (5'3 145lbs, 32DDD-27-39) so I'll be gifting it to a more petite lady friend."
2.0,"Poor quality steel used, makes my ears itch every time I wear them, despite numerous cleanings."
2.0,"I have a 31&#34; waist but ordered 38, and they've shrunk from what was full cut to bikinis. Good underwear for traveling, toss them after you wear them."
2.0,"These were absolutely perfect for work. My hands were broke out from touching the fabric all day and these covered my arms nicely. However, the SECOND day I had them I noticed the stitching coming undone. The 3rd day I had to take them to one of our seamstress and have her sew them back together. She did this 2 days in a row. I hand stitched them last night, just to get me thru Tuesday bc I ordered a Copperfit pair. Maybe those won't fall apart."
2.0,"I read that it fits small and to order a size or 2 up so I got a XXL for my son and it looks like a true 2x. Very soft and comfortable material. It was delivered to my door step on the 1st day it said could arrive.  I ordered another 1 in a different color. *** Editing because I ordered 2 suits but only received 1. Seller states it was handed off, I never received. Amazon did refund me for the 2nd suit!"
2.0,The belt was smaller than expected.  May have to return it.
2.0,"This swim top fit slightly big, but the shelf bra was too big and somehow, the pads in the bra too small. It just was not fitting me. I did like the way the shirt, but again, I can't use it. I think a smaller size would not help."
2.0,"Not what I had expected, it fades quickly and it will irritate your skin if you have sensitive skin..."
2.0,Beautiful print. Looks exactly like the picture. Not stretch fabric. Would buy again if it was the right size.
2.0,"I have had belt for several months and wear it almost every day with jeans. Belt advertised as leather. However, after several months of use the leather ""skin"" is breaking and starting to peel off...  NOT A FULL LEATHER BELT!"
2.0,The material was absolutely terrible I didn’t even bother putting this on my body. If you are a texture person then this is not what you are looking for
2.0,Neck isnt made well. Looks like I stretched it out of original shape.
2.0,"This romper was true to size and fit my son as expected. BUT, after the first wash the buttons to close the bottom feel off. I knew I was purchasing this item for cheap so I'm not too disappointed but beware."
2.0,"Very cheaply made. I expected better. Flimsy, should have bought the ones from the the dollar store would have been a better quality. Loose fitting, not large enough to cover my glasses, very flimsy materials used.<br />[[ASIN:B010RJU3B4 Womens Polarized Fit Over Glasses Rhinestone Sunglasses Oval Rectangular Pink]] eyeglasses and very flimsy materials."
2.0,I do recommend this shirt at all. Way too small and not soft at all. Should only be $5.
2.0,"I ordered a large and the bottoms fit me like a small. They squeezed every part of me. The top barely contained my breast. I’m 5’6” 175lbs. I’m a 40E/DD. Couldn’t wear it at all. Got it just after having a baby, didn’t make me feel good at all."
2.0,These are much larger flowers than expected. I had planned on my junior bridesmaid and flower girl to wear that but that is not possible.
2.0,"Initially really liked this bra.<br />Does it offer support? No, there’s zero lift but it is comfortable and there won’t be any lift because there’s no band on the bottom.<br />It stretches out through the day, only one wear per wash.<br />Definitely good for being comfy around the house, or if you’re not particularly busty and don’t need support."
2.0,I was surprised by the material. It’s silky vs cotton.
2.0,"This dress is very sexy but too small for me oh, I liked it so much I returned it for an extra large"
2.0,Fit perfect around torso but is to tight around my neck when I have to cris cross it.
2.0,Are very cheap looking. Cheaper than something at a discount chain store). Have a plastic look and are more orange than gold color.  But with how cheap they are it is kind of what you should expect.
2.0,The neck it HUGE.. does not fit anyone who is a smaller petite frame i had to pin it just to give it a normal neck line.  someone a bit larger would probably fit.  The shape and sleeves are nice.
2.0,The product is not an A-line or skirted at the bottom as depicted in the picture. The material is very thin. The shirt is very loose except in the arms. The arms seem to fit the correct size. I am 5’3” and 95 lbs. I ordered an XS and will be wearing it over tights with a shirt underneath and a belt.
2.0,First time used the zipper handle broke off. Now zipper is stuck in place making it an effort to put  shoe on/pff.
2.0,Sorry but back fastner came  off love the color
2.0,strap is too big for a child
2.0,"Dress runs small. Go a size up past what the size chart says. Material wrinkles easily. the material is not see-through, if you were curious. Had to return and will be buying something different. Even if the garment came back in a size that fit, I would not want to repeatedly dry clean the dress."
2.0,A returned these shorts because the size is not correct. I ordered a size up as recommended and I shouldn't have. These are more for comfort than they are for style.
2.0,"This is a beautiful coat for the price, but when I took it out of the package the button fell off. It was also to small around the arms. I suggest buying a size up. Disappointed I really like the coat. I will have to send it back."
2.0,"They were OK. They look nice but one of them doesn't lay right against an ear, I had to bend it slightly for it to look better."
2.0,Flimsy visor.
2.0,I gave them as a gift to my sister and they fell apart the same day :(
2.0,Too tight and not comfortable but didn't get a rash (in short few times I wore them)
2.0,"Listen to the reviews that point out the inconsistencies in the products! I purchased an XL and the fit is accurate, haven't washed yet though. My experience:<br /><br />Seams don't line up as mentioned in reviews (see pic)<br />Colors are WAY OFF as mentioned in reviews - I purchased what I thought would be a dusty rose w/leopard....not even close. More of a baby pink which I will never wear (see pic)<br />Same for the 'Charlie Brown' zig-zag shirt - colors are WAY OFF.<br />The blue leopard has an accurate color depiction. However, no one has mentioned that the leopard stripe is basically a plasticy iron on patch (which both smells and makes a sound when you run your nails over it) that has a life of its own. The patch is wide and doesn't sit very well and bunches up at your armpits. I'm hopeful this will change once it's washed. (See pic)<br /><br />I didn't have crazy high hopes for these shirts,  but am still bummed at how 'off' they truly are from the pics."
2.0,"Recipient reports that this bra fit irregularly.  It fit in the cup,but pinched around the underarm.  The hardware/hooks attached, were of poor quality and wouldn't stay put when mother-to-be, attempted to try it on.  It looked appealing and comfortable, but in this case... you get only what you pay for."
2.0,Chinese cheap sandals only worth 10 dollars definitely not 40.00 dollars squeak after they get wet. Do not buy not worth the money.
2.0,Very small more for child vs adult
2.0,"I can't even tell if they look good on or not because even after ordering a size up, they are still significantly small. This company's sizing chart is obviously WAY off. Don't even bother because they're not worth it and it's a hassle to return them."
2.0,"They are over all good equality, however the framing is not at all what I expected, I rarely ever wear them."
2.0,"Oh no! What happened to this hat? It is not supposed to flop like this way yet it does. I cannot wear it outside in public both for safety reasons and it doesn’t look cool. I can’t see anything without tilting my head all the way back or holding the flopping hat with both my hands and so it looks, well like the picture. I tried leaving it alone for 2 days to see if that made a difference but it didn’t. Sorry, I wouldn't recommend it."
2.0,Looking for something more dainty  very large and chunky
2.0,"Uhhh I mean it was cheap, so I knew it wouldn't look exactly as shown. But the roughing is not flattering around the hips surprisingly, and the ruffle is not like shown at all. It doesn't have that starched look like in the picture. Even when ironed, it's not like what is pictured"
2.0,"I ordered a mystery package, which I understood I might bot like everything. The bracelet is gorgeous. The necklace was in a baggie and I find it hard to believe it was a 1928 product. The earrings were plainly on a card with a different brand on them.<br />Placing this order was nostalgic because I used to buy this beand all the time, but I was pretty disappointed."
2.0,"Washed once when I got it, went to wear it for the first time and noticed a hole where the pocket meets the shirt. Would not recommend, would not buy again."
2.0,These are very nice quality skirts and would be great if they were sized anything close to the description.  My 3X size skirts will only fit maybe a sized 16-18 ladies.  Hugely disappointing!
2.0,"This jacket is a super shedder. Total embarrassment, I wore it over a navy tee and when I removed the jacket it looked like I rolled around in dog hair."
2.0,Thought it was a sweater. Fit light an oversized sweatshirt. Not flatteting
2.0,"Misleading, The TITLE says 5pc, but as you choose the color, the amount changes but not on the title, changes where the COLOR is supposed to be ..."
2.0,It was WAY TOO BIG!  Would not stay on to keep my ears warm. Not a fan of the snaps near the chin. Metal snaps get cold.
2.0,"Very tiny, they are not good for an adult sized ear."
2.0,"Run small and material is thin, avoid the light colors."
2.0,The hooks come off too easy.
2.0,Please look elsewhere. Its free shipping but you can't wear it if you have breast and move a c cup!
2.0,"Not worth it. I received this, took a good look at it and sent it back. The inner material appeared so flimsy that I had doubts it would hold up carrying my iPhone more than a months use. Very cheap material."
2.0,It’s too big I need a smaller size can I exchange it
2.0,Fits way smaller that TTS should have gone up at least one if not two sizes
2.0,"Im 5'4&#34; and and this suit is cut and sewn for an even shorter person. Foam cups in bra are think as a shoe soul. Horrible  even if it did fit. Makin money off me, cause I will just pitch this suit."
2.0,Runs super small. Came in a vacuum bag. And fluffed out nicely. Very soft
2.0,"This dress runs very large. I am 5'4&#34;, 150lbs, 36DD, ordered a medium and it looks like a tent. No shape whatsoever. Maybe go down TWO sizes??"
2.0,There was the main stone missing sent it back
2.0,Way too small on me and I'm 5'2&#34; and wear a size 2.
2.0,Everything was embellished for marketing...I don't like what I received. I liked what was pictured and had expectations when I bought it...<br /><br />Pouch that holds filter is sooooo loose it goes in your mouth when you breath. Fun times!? Right!?
2.0,"Item came , pull the tab, nothing. Chance the battery, still nothing. Should check the hat if working before sending."
2.0,Frames broke after 1 month. Didn't even wear them all the time. I took very good care of them as well. Always stored them wrapped in the cleaning cloth inside the soft bag it came with. Very disappointed that they broke so easily. They were nice looking sunglasses.<br />UPDATE: the company contacted me and replaced them at no cost without any hassle. I appreciate the immediate response to find a solution.<br />UPDATE: The replacement pair broke too. In the same spot. The seller offered another free pair. Their coupon code didn’t work. I gave up. I won’t order these again. Very disappointed.
2.0,Tried it. It’s fine if you are not moving or talking. But as soon as you moving it moves. Going to be impossible to find replacement filters.
2.0,"Too small, when washed, it strunk."
2.0,Not a goos quality item and it was too small.
2.0,"Stitching on sleeve split after wearing with armor for less than one hour. This, as with all gambesons, is extraordinarily hot. Don’t plan on wearing it if the temp is above 70 degrees F. Looks great, just poor craftsmanship."
2.0,Pulls my hair out.  Now my hair is all tangled in the beads. And it hurt.  Too bad because it's cute. But I'll never wear it again.
2.0,This fabric does not wash nicely.  They look messy.
2.0,They're very pretty but also very heavy if you have ears and you can't stand heavy earrings these are not for you.
2.0,"Cute look ,but cheaply made."
2.0,"I ordered this dress because the pattern is do elegant and classy. My size (L) was sold out, so I ordered a XXL thinking that I will have to make some adjustments. I am 5'6'' and 165lbs. Size XXL is snug and the belt that comes with the dress is probably for a size S. I went and bought a belt at Target. Too bad that the fabric is pretty, big whoever is making these dresses, does not have any idea of measurement and sizes. That's why I only gave it two stars."
2.0,They were fine for a couple of months but then started to get very thin and holes would appear. I can’t wear 3 of the pairs anymore. They’re cute but don’t last.
2.0,"i ordered this for my sister who's actually 34a but it was to small for her, it fit my other sister that uses 30a"
2.0,When you spend 35 dollars on a hat you'd expect it to show up in a box that protects it from getting crushed and misshapen and not in a plastic bag with nothing but a shipping label to protect it. Spent 1hour trying to get it formed back again still not correct. Unacceptable
2.0,Hangs very weird . Not cute
2.0,It didn't look like the picture. It was smaller than the size I ordered.
2.0,I loved this bag for about 20 minutes.<br /><br />it looks great and holds a lot but it took no exaggeration 20 minutes for the link that holds the shoulder strap to the the jump ring to break. so I fixed it with a different ring I had an thought I'd deal with it but 2 days later the other side broke the same way.
2.0,the tie was not very wide.  the description did not list a measurement.  if i send it back i will have to eat the freight.  i would rather burn it.
2.0,"The hands are not gold, they are silver.<br /><br />The rose gold band and case are not really rose gold.  It's stainless steel with a very light amount of gold color or copper added to it.<br /><br />I own the stainless black face / white hands version and it's amazing.  This watch needs a v2 with gold hands and proper fake gold.  I had a rose gold parnis daytona homage and the gold color looks amazing.  I wish Pagani could do something similar."
2.0,Very cheaply made and not worth $20. Looks like a $5 apron with the picture printed on and not really waterproof….
2.0,washed once on 'handwash' cycle and it pilled.
2.0,Not made well . Real thin cut real small to .
2.0,The picture on here made it look like the shirt was black. I got it and it was blue with sunflowers
2.0,"Was a nice ring for a  while, but the two bands going across the top get caught on everything and did eventually break off."
2.0,It looks cute. The color is nice. But it does NOT stay put. It shifts constantly and the hinge gets stuck in my piercing canal constantly and it hurts. Once it shifts it’s really hard to move.
2.0,I was really disappointed when I received this item. The front of the shirt was way too high so I couldn't wear it. It didn't look like the picture - the front was much higher than the picture shows.
2.0,Not round at all wrong picture for the product
2.0,"This set is rose gold, not gold. They are 2 separate necklaces which is nice. They aren't marked at all so who knows what kind of metal it is. Unfortunately the shorter necklace broke before I could even try it on. Overall, I'm not very impressed."
2.0,"Did not look as nice as picture. The butterflies weren't pronounced. The strings are a bit loose for me,  in an adult, so it rides up my face even though I squeeze the noise.  Sorry I bought 100."
2.0,"I mistakenly tried to wash them to hopefully get them to shrink but no luck. I should've known better since they we're way too big to start with. I just didn't want to go through the hassle of returning. But now I wasted $25 because now I cant return them.  I wear a large.  5'-10""  185 lbs.  These Large were like a tent on me.  Disappointed and out money"
2.0,"The pendent is too heavy, the chain tagles around the pendent and it looks cheap."
2.0,"Great color. Runs small, size not true."
2.0,Not chiffon but satin. Way too long! Got the Medium because said it ran small but Medium was too big. Pretty but major disappointment. Am returning.
2.0,comes in TINY don't be fooled folks!
2.0,Too thin for Cold weather or anything else. Wouldn't stay up
2.0,Stiff cotton and not flowing at all. Not well made for my tastes.
2.0,"Nice boot but too small. Size label said 11, but were more like a 9.5 or 10.  Could hardly get them on."
2.0,"Okay, I almost never return anything I've purchased on Amazon. And this was the first time I've ever had to. Here's what's wrong with these sunglasses.<br /><br />1) The picture gives you the impression that the frames and lenses are champagne colored, with a light tint on the lenses. Not even close. The frames do have a gold/champagne like color to them, but in certain light, they also almost have a rose like tint to them. The lenses are dark brown, and only look like the pictures when direct light is passing through. In other words, they will look dark brown on your face.<br /><br />2) These are small frames made for someone with a slender face or a child. You get no sense of that in the picture.<br /><br />3) The item description says these are &#34;unisex&#34;, but I disagree. These sunglasses are definitely more suitable for a woman's face. They just have a feminine look to them that is not conveyed in the pictures.<br /><br />4) For $25, these are terribly overpriced. I've bought sunglasses like these at half the price, and twice the quality. The frame is a rather ordinary plastic. Not cheap, but certainly not high-end. There are no flexible hinges on the stems, and you don't even receive a nice gift box or bag, or cloth for wiping the lenses. These sunglasses should be sold for no more than $10."
2.0,"Pretty to look at, but chain is very thin.  Many kinks in chain when it arrived, and the chain has to go through tiny holes on the main metal &#34;circle&#34; on end of the chain, making the kinks an issue.  No instructions, so had to experiment on how to open the little pendant.  The pendant is nice, and if the jump ring that is a part of the pendant is big enough, I will be able to attach a stronger chain.  Otherwise, I cannot imagine this chain being strong enough for an active person to use.  Would not buy another."
2.0,"I received these leg warmers, hoping to be able to wear them to a party I was attending. I received them fine, but when I opened the package the sewing was all messed up, elastic coming out from seams. I just threw them in the trash"
2.0,"Watch is beautiful, but very unreliable timepiece. Shame"
2.0,Didn’t like the material of this shirt!
2.0,Letter started peeling off at the corner almost immediately.
2.0,Cute dress but too long for me.
2.0,"The top fits well, but the pants are HUGE!  Not only are they very big around the waist, the legs are cut very wide.  I don't see how anyone who fits into the pants would be able to wear the top. Also the fabric is too &#34;polyester-y&#34; for my taste.  These are probably going back as it's not worth the work to tailor the pants to fit me."
2.0,"The charm is beautiful, but when I opened the box I found the necklace was broke."
2.0,"These aren't great socks, they shrunk horribly. They're tiny, like child size. Oh, well, I guess I'll buy something different in the future."
2.0,Look great but they don't stay on if you're going to try to wear them for more than an hour or half-hour.
2.0,Very disappointed. Fits nice but bottom button missing! Now it looks used and I can’t match the button
2.0,"The spring is not resilient, if stretched it does not retract."
2.0,"The backpack was very uncomfortable on my shoulders (straps were too wide, and the inner part of the straps dug into my shoulders/neck) and the material seemed really inexpensive for a backpack.  I have returned this backpack in favor of an Eddie Bauer, less &#34;cool looking&#34; but much more comfortable backpack."
2.0,Kind of resembles a flight attendant unifrom in person. sort of disappointed.
2.0,Not very high quality leather. Very stiff and plasticy.
2.0,"I ordered according to the size chart.  Dress was way to small.  My daughter who is a couple sizes smaller, also found it to tight.  The material was very nice.  The top lace was thicker, but looked nice.  The bottom fabric would be flattering, if not to tight.  I will be returning."
2.0,starting to get holes after second wear.  very thin material.
2.0,Cheap like a costume
2.0,So short! And much more yellow than the picture
2.0,"Disliked the fabric. However,  it will be OK as a around the house summer dress."
2.0,"I purchased this item for a 6 year old, but had to return it because I could see that the princess shoes would only probably fit girls ages 2-4."
2.0,Very see threw. Not a big fan
2.0,Quality is really cheap and expensive.
2.0,Too Small & kinda cheap made....gave it away.
2.0,"Very cute, but it faded within a couple days"
2.0,Very cheap looking !
2.0,For starters I like the idea of the bag. It has a good layout and you can fit quite a bit in it. Now the problem is I've been using it for less then a month and I've already had the stitching around the main zipper blow out in 2 spots.
2.0,"Originally the scarf comes with a noticeable white tag on the bottom. I carefully removed it, but the seams are coming undone. It's also very thick, so when I tried tearing it into a bow, it looks a little funky."
2.0,Falls apart where the Wood band connects to the metal clasp
2.0,"They pull at my ears, and then actually pop off my face with the slightest of touching.  Not comfortable for a regular size adult man."
2.0,"One pair seems ok, but the other one has a large, circular scratch in the middle of the right lens."
2.0,the vest is to long almost to my knee
2.0,Made it one week and broke. Returned
2.0,These are more like tights. Very very thin. Returned
2.0,wig fit but not the hat
2.0,"The dimensions of 16.5 x 11.5  are misleading.  These are the dimensions of the item completely flattened.  Nobody would ever use the item like this.  The actual dimensions with the bag opened are closer to 12""w X 10""h X 5""d."
2.0,The ring is really cute and I was so excited about it at first but after wearing it for a while I found that it slides up my finger. I don't think the fit us the issue because if I sized up it would be too loose and if I sized down it would be way too tight. I really love the design but I won't be wearing it sadly.
2.0,"The shirt is not fitted, the print is off center. It’s cute enough that I’ll still wear it but it’s not what I’d hoped."
2.0,This robe would have been a lot better if it had loops to hold the belt onto it
2.0,"It was thinner than expected. But overall it looked okay. BUT, after I washed it i put it through the wash and the stripes and glasses became sticky and turned yellow. Would not buy again."
2.0,"The ring rolls just fine and fits as expected, but two of the rings have ugly seams. You might not be able to see in the picture, but the edges don't even line up so it's a little sharp. I'd rather spend a little more and get something that looks and feels better, I'll be returning this."
2.0,Cute but too bad the silver coating easily rubs off when exposed to any acid
2.0,"Ad overly flamboyant about this sock. Material is thick, makes shoes fit tight.  Most unfortunate part is they don't facilitate air circulation are Hot and way too tight around the calf; leaves marks.  Nice toe and heal pockets and not too tight around foot, but excessive leg compression makes them uncomfortable.  Thus being returned.  Have tried Dr. Scholl's and Coppecross; both of which are preferred over these."
2.0,"I ranged from sizes 18 to 24, and 1x to 3x. I'm apple shaped and they were not a good fit! At all. I gave these to my daughter, shes a size 14 to 16 and heavy bottomed, fit her perfect."
2.0,The material feels great but the bathing suit was cheaply made. The wire came out of the bar area after only 2 wears.
2.0,"this necklace lasted about 2 weeks with the color!!! the beads themselves are white with paint ontop, it faded after only have it for not even a while. this was definitely not worth 3 bucks"
2.0,"I had to order 2 sizes up to fit my child. After a couple of washes, the fabric is pilling. Strange. Disappointed since its so cute."
2.0,NOT a nightgown. It’s actually more of a shirt. Super short. Definitely NOT a nightgown. Only comes down to my daughters waist and she’s only 5’5”.
2.0,It is definitely not a size small I wear a four I would say this is either an eight or a 10 which is a big fat bummer
2.0,Product is about a size or two too big and is not the same as the picture.
2.0,Very thin. Not worth the price.
2.0,Nice and light not very  good quality definitely not worth the price
2.0,the sleeve are very short
2.0,For a ring that is supposed to be sterling silver within a day it turned my finger green.
2.0,First thing i can say was a nice looking watch however one i got looked like i recieved a return so that was disappointing since used as a gift and the watch didnt work right  so i had to return i did not reorder another in fear of getting  another bad one and disappointing  my dad with it if didn't work again since i saw others had same issue i would say i would get another if i knew it worked for sure
2.0,Flimsy didn't last long lense keeps falling out
2.0,"Runs very small. I like tunics because they are comfortable. I ordered a medium and found it too tight, even in the arms. I think a large would still be too tight. I retuned it."
2.0,"I reaaaalllly wanted to love this dress, I love the design and I knew I should have listened to the reviews but I couldn't find another dress like it so I took a chance. Sad face. I'm a size 16 and I'm 5'5&#34; now thicker girls should know better when it comes to Asian sizing but cal said it would fit 14 to 16...now it did but was a little tighter than I liked and the worst part, it wasn't maxi! It went to my knees, even if I lost 50 pounds this would not be considered maxi. And it had what I think were supposed to be pockets....by the boob area might I add, who does that...but there is nothing in the world you could put in there to consider it a pocket, more like a brief opening. I'll probably return it, or see if someone I know looks killer in it, but please be cautious with this. 5 points to Gryffindor for nice material."
2.0,"Looked cheap, to small"
2.0,The lace on the top is somewhat awkward. It definitely does not look like it looks in the pic on me.
2.0,Waist fit and length were good but there was way too much crotch.
2.0,"Skivvies hardly inspire a review, and these are no exception.  They fit fine and do the job.  My mistake was in this color choice, it is far too gay for an old Navy man who is not. I may only wear these for mud wrestling."
2.0,I ave a 6 and 8 year old with smallish heads and these were snug.
2.0,It looks cheap. Thin brown buttons on a medium dark blue fabric. Puh-lees!  Ugly look and ugly feeling.
2.0,"I am giving it 2 stars because the price is cheap, and if you need a cute dress for a costume this may work in a pinch. However, there was weird stitching in the inside back of the dress running perpendicular to the zipper. It was about 4 inches of loose thread stitched this way over a good portion of the zipper. This caused the zipper to frequently get stuck. There were also loose threads everywhere on other parts of the dress. I am returning."
2.0,"This product was described as 100% wool, but the label says clearly it’s 85% acrylic and 15% wool. That makes this hat very overpriced. Also, the button on top should be black and not red. Probably will return it."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:84f550ba8738a980efb382c51b0b5c28]] It’s too thin and very cheaply made it’s not like the photo, very disappointed, goodbye!"
2.0,These are quite large and do not fit a small face with large cheekbones.  They also seem on the cheap side compared to my other Walleva pair.
2.0,These socks are cute and comfortable but they don't glow in the dark as advertised.  I'm disappointed because I bought them because they were supposed to glow in the dark
2.0,Cheaply made and did not fit me well.
2.0,Fabric is too flimsy and loose; too large for small toddlers. It will maybe fit an adult face better
2.0,Size runs really really small! Gave to my 10 yr old!
2.0,Looked nice. But color change wasn’t so great. Can’t really get it to turn red regardless of light source.
2.0,"This tie is nice quality, but it is NOT EXTRA LONG.  It is about 4 inches short of that description.  Did not serve my purpose"
2.0,"The band is as advertised and absolutely is a beautiful flex band. Matches the color of my watch beautifully. Beyond that, incredibly disappointed.<br /><br />I wore the band literally one day to work and the finish was already badly scratching off. Yes, I appreciate it’s not a $400 band from Apple, but even at $80, I expect the finish to last more than an 8-hour day. Perhaps this is simply poor consistency in quality from a particular factory, but not thrilled. Already started the refund process."
2.0,this bathing suit was made for someone very small breasted. Maybe an A cup. I need to return this.
2.0,"Disappointed.  Style and cut is perfect but color and material/fabric......REALLY!!! Color was supposed to be olive green....it is black!!! An ugly black!!!. And material is is pure spandex feeling and the kind of cheap polyester that is wrinkled.. I wanted several in different colors,  even had them in my shopping cart, sorry but wont buy again. Cant recommend this product in good conscience.  Sorry."
2.0,Too small. Can't really tell what it is without a magnifying glass
2.0,"Sadly, gonna have to return it. I read the part about &#34;The belt is sleek and clean, and provides a perfect fit for everyone.&#34; and didn't notice that it only fits a maximum waist size of 37&#34;. My waist is somewhat larger (42&#34;), as are many Americans', so there isn't enough excess to fit me. They should really consider selling a size that would accommodate more men, since you're expected to trim it down anyway."
2.0,"The plastic doesn't look like the pictures.  It's flimsy, wrinkled, and hard to see through."
2.0,"I loved the look of the blue lens, but unfortunately it does nothing to protect my eyesight from the sun.  The lens work fine while driving only because my car's windows have additional tenting to help protect my eyesight, but whenever I exit the car, I find myself squinting and my eyes hurting from the sun with the glasses on.  Also, the frame of the glasses are flat and the lens are triangular in shape.  I discovered that this is not flattering to a round face."
2.0,This dress is totally different from picture and description. No tie or pockets! Just a straight midi dress. Would not recommend. It looks completely unfinished as though the tie and pockets were forgotten. Would not recommend!
2.0,The shorts are long and the waistband is super thin...weirdly built...a lose elastic band floating in the fabric for the wasit...the elastic around the leg bottom is tighter than the stretch of the actual leg part...I still wear them but they are built funny and cheap
2.0,We use bra clips like this for bathing suit straps.  The old ones we had were double the size these are much smaller and have a hard time holding the straps.  Keep falling out.
2.0,Purchase this for my granddaughter for her cosplay. The pants were too long and the waist was too tight.  There were also no laundering instructions inside the package or on a tag inside the outfit.  Very disappointing.
2.0,"I was very hopeful, due to the advertising, but the shoes are so hard, they hurt my seismoids.  Also, the<br />cloth bands are placed too far from edge, so they squeeze my foot, although the size is correct."
2.0,The picture shown is not the true depiction of the appearance. The actual product is much smaller than the picture. I wouldn’t have purchased if I saw the actual product prior to the purchase.
2.0,There's small for me and I gave to somebody as donation.
2.0,"Pendant was way bigger than expected, size of a nickel and the chain was a lot longer than anticipated. Pendant was barley hanging on to the chain. Engraving is average but not centered."
2.0,"I was very disappointed that these didn't come as complete earrings.  Only received 7 earring backs.  But other then that, they are ok."
2.0,"Advertised as chlorine resistant but it only lasted a few weeks of water aerobics classes before the elastic around the butt and legs became loose and the fabric in the butt (one layer, not lined like some other styles of suit from same seller are) so it is see through over your butt. Very disappointed in the money wasted."
2.0,"Jacket was kind of tight and pants were way too big. The waist of pants were bigger than expected and the crotch line went down very low, almost like mens pants- very awkward. Material was also thick and felt cheap. I liked the style of the suit, which is why I purchased in the first place but overall it was very uncomfortable"
2.0,I’m convinced that dresses with a seam line like this dress is not fitting for females with a chest. Very I’ll fitting in the chest area
2.0,"Just opened this and the pineapples top was bent up and band was bent into oval shape. I bent it down and am going to keep but I am not happy. Worried it will break. The band itself is very soft. Definantely is an extremely delicate ring. I am so sad, was super excited about the ring, wanted to love it. Cute but NOT sturdy. I defiantly feel like I payed WAY too much for it at $15. Not a good value/purchase. BUYER BEWARE."
2.0,To small even do its a large the don't fit they to short.
2.0,It was ridiculously huge and immediately returned but the material wasn’t terrible.
2.0,"It’s cute but the material is cheap and extremely scratchy. The inside of the bonnet is the roughest part, which defeats the purpose of buying this to protect my curly hair. The band is not only itchy but is also too tight and gives me a headache."
2.0,Torso is extremely short.
2.0,These are very small. Barely fit me and I am a woman’s size 7.
2.0,This might work for A-B and maybe C cups but not for D and above.  The suction just doesn't hold.
2.0,Giving it two stars because I love how the top fits and looks. Unfortunately the bottoms were completely see thru and were sewed oddly at the waist. Will be wearing the top out though!
2.0,"Blouse came completely wrinkled! Fabric in pic looks silky but IRL it’s cheap, wrinkle prone fabric. Returned for Amazon credit only. Disappointing."
2.0,I am well-endowed up top and this shirt would not stretch at all. I bought my normal size which is a large and I could barely get it on over my chest. I would recommend ordering a size up if you are large chested.
2.0,This is very pretty but the material does not give at all and it's hot to wear.
2.0,The seam hits right at the bust line making the top unflattering.
2.0,Don't like the light feature..expected more
2.0,The mask was cute but was loose and didn’t fit right
2.0,The overall comfort was chunky.
2.0,"It’s really cute and fun but the little gold beads tarnished within a couple days and always smelled like metal. I had to take them off and I’m just wearing the silver hoop which is comfortable. I wear it in my septum. Beware of the beads falling off when you put it in, they’re slippery little buggers."
2.0,"I read all the reviews for this product, and everyone said it ran small, and to order up a size. Well, there was no need to order up a size. This was massive, and I even tried to wash it on hot to shrink it, it didn’t. I’m extremely bummed out because it was a gift for someone very important in my life and part of a celebration of his sobriety. He’s obsessed with the scream movies. Obviously I can’t return it now, because it has been washed. Just highly disappointed, and usually the reviewers are right, but not this time. At all. This is so disappointing because the T-shirt is really fabulous!!!"
2.0,To big on the top too short in the legs
2.0,"They both smelled strongly of tobacco smoke. My skin continued to smell like smoke after I got done trying on the dresses.<br /><br />I wasn't sure of the sizing of the dress so I ordered a small and a medium. I'm 5 foot 5 in, 128 lbs, bust 35 waist 28. I can average anywhere between a size 6 (small) and size 8 (medium) depending on brand. The length on both hit about right under my knee. The small was way too small and the medium was snug. It did give a little because of the stretchy material but I still felt like the medium was a little uncomfortable. If I was keeping it I would have gone large for a less constricting fit. The sleeves are irritating and itchy on my shoulders. It's not a bad dress, just not what I had hoped I would get for that price."
2.0,"The glasses are attractive looking but terrible for video conferences because they are so reflective. People can’t even see my eyes, just bright screen reflection and this in itself causes me eye strain.  They might be okay for just wearing to do computer work, I have no way to determine if it really relieves eye strain but for video meetings they are not good."
2.0,"Definitely purchase a size or two up, it runs VERY small. Otherwise a nice material, good quality."
2.0,I liked and expected the selection of shapes that was pictured and very disappointed that most items were not as pictured
2.0,I like the shorts but they fit too tight. I have a 34 waist and bought a 36 waist but after first wash the shorts are too tight...should have bought a 38.
2.0,"If you are tall (over 5'6) don't buy this.<br />It runs very small and does not fit  loosely like the picture.  I got a lg to be safe, it's still a bit tight.<br />I'm a size 6-8, 5'81/2."
2.0,"It's short, has an awkward hood, and is way to small in the arms."
2.0,The logo will most definitely come off after one wash. No doubt about it. It's already starting to lift and it hasn't even been worn yet. Waited over 2 months for it to arrive and am regretting the purchase.
2.0,Only wore it twice before the wrist band broke from the watch face
2.0,"Jacket looked more substantial in the photograph.  After one wear, it started to develop a &#34;picked&#34; look.  I expected much more for the price."
2.0,The breast area to wide
2.0,dont bother - they are pretty and make a great statement - but they dont clip well onto most heels - they fell off after a few steps. This order the clip arrived broken
2.0,my wife ordered  small  size but it's too loose for her like large. she always order small size but this dress is too big for her she is not happy about it so she will give for a gift to her friend.
2.0,The quality of this Cosmos 4pcs black are very poor in comparison to the Cosmos 7pcs different color cotton sports baskethead bands. I purchases the 7pcs colored a week prior and they work great. Went ahead and purchased the the black ones thinking they were the same quality but was wrong. These are much thinner and don't retain sweat well.
2.0,This was not size accurate. Far too big for a 3X. Even after it was washed.
2.0,It looked very much like a maternity dress because of the empire waist and style. And that’s only cute when you’re pregnant… so no thanks
2.0,It is pretty but does not work.
2.0,Not true fit
2.0,"The fit was perfect, one of the three,  the Blue one has a big hole at the back. I'm sure this is  a factory error."
2.0,I didn't like the plastic snap part that goes around the back of your neck (if you were to put it on) it actually broke within days of purchase.
2.0,Not gold or gold plated. Maybe brass. Not exactly what I was expecting. It's bigger that a quarter coin but not heavy. It's bulky and not well made. One earings had a white-eshy spot on it and it was brown underneath. Also the tiny golden bead detail on the earing trim was uneven in one of the studs. Overall I did not like.
2.0,They would be nice if the pads weren’t removable- what’s the point?? I sewed them in but it doesn’t help much. I wouldn’t buy them again
2.0,"The material is very thin and didn’t really serve its purpose. Second, the material was so thin that it kept bunching up under my dress that I had to keep pulling them down. I’d return it, but I already wore it."
2.0,Fit too large. My nice can't use it yet. She has to wait at least one more year i think to wear it.
2.0,Too narrow in the foot and too small in the calf. Nice leather but couldn’t wear them
2.0,I didn’t like the fit or material of the dress
2.0,Made really small about 2 sizes too small
2.0,Soft fabric material that's unflattering. Photo looks like a more cotton material.
2.0,I was not happy with the capri yoga pants. They are to small fitting and  I felt like I had to pull them up all of the time. I had purchased some Champion yoga pants at a department store and I loved them. I was hoping these were like them but they were not. I will be giving them away.
2.0,"This floral did not look like it did on the model, on my size 6, 5ft 2in body.  Of course not - they never do, do they?  While the body of the dress fit, it was sooooo long.  Tea length.  Which in turn cut my legs off and made me look squat and fat.  The jersey fabric was heavy, and clung to all the parts of my torso I didn't want it to.  I belted it with a brown leather belt and still no luck.  I don't recommend."
2.0,Granddaughter loved this but the necklace broke. The dog clip is still attaced.
2.0,"Not a good product, they changed colors on me."
2.0,"We ordered this mask for Halloween for my son,  it broke  as we unpacked it. It was nice quality just very disappointed it was so brittle."
2.0,Material was too thin and shows everything.  You would have to wear a slip or spanx.
2.0,"I first ordered this in my usual size, Medium.  It was too large, so I returned it and re-ordered in size Small.  Still way too big.  I really liked it in the photo, but I guess it wasn’t meant to be.  For reference I’m 5’ 7”, 122 pounds, 36D bra.  ☹️"
2.0,"It’s cute, fits right but it’s poorly assembled. The zip part goes all down the dress and hangs out of the bottom of the dress. There’s also a big clump of thread hanging out by the zipper."
2.0,Material was so so and didn’t like how it fit one me. Could have kept since this item was not expensive but didn’t think it was worth keeping something that wouldn’t last or that I didn’t loved.
2.0,I'm kind of dissappointed in this bag. I love the style and I love the zipper to expand it. But it's smaller than I though so my wallet (a standard ladies trifold) doesn't fit and I have to buy a new one. Also the Velcro on the front is not sewn on properly and the piece on the bag is perpendicular to the piece on the flap and does hold the bag closed. Considering a return.
2.0,"Good quality for the price, but the description and photos are misleading. The dial is not white at all, it's a color similar to alluminum, only the outer section is actually white. Much better than other watches in this price range, but this is not what I was expecting and I hate being lied to. Paired it with a Barton Crimson Red canvas watch band to improve the overall look of the watch."
2.0,I absolutely love it I love so much that I'm orderin more.... Sorry but it broke 2 ezy
2.0,"Very small. I ordered XL. I'm 6'1, #215. I typically wear Large in Huk. This hoodie's sleeves are 6 inches too short. The chest is between Large and Medium. I am returning item.<br />Material feels soft, stretchy-enough, and very thin."
2.0,"You can not see the owl yin yang very well, and as soon as the person who I bought it for, put it on the chain broke. He never got the  opportunity th wear it.He was so excited when it arrived, he loves owls.But now he is very disappointed."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:48bdff736215135d8cdbc5896505c08b]] One says “No Pay No again” and another says “Stay Hungry Stay Foolish” some people may find this insulting instead of inspiring. Lol.
2.0,The price is affordable but a very strange smell of the leather. Disappointed with the quality compared to other leather belts that i had bought. The leather on both sides is inconsistent. The leather is soft
2.0,Have had two pair break at the nose bridge.
2.0,they were too small at the ankle and did not stretch caused ankle edema.  the body of the sock was okay
2.0,Is not what I expected is cheap and the hair comes  out when comb
2.0,Very pretty but WAY too small and has no stretch to it (didn't expect it to) so you should go several sizes up. Do not recommend for anyone over a US size 12
2.0,"Finally tested this on my toddler and the shirt is tissue thin. The seams on the ends of the sleeve and bottom of the shirt are not clean, and the back of the lettering is rough against the skin. Looks and feels very cheap, which is unfortunate because the skirt is actually adorable and looks great. Returning this."
2.0,It literally swallows my face! It’s not breathable. I won’t wear it. You win some. You lose some. This one I lost.
2.0,"I washed it once and the seams of the top half of the dress came apart. Would not buy again. Also bought a large, I’m 5’6” and 160lbs, it was too big!"
2.0,No gustar mucho
2.0,"These socks were way too tight for me and what I needed them for. I was not able to run with them, they hurt my legs whenever I was running. There is possibly too much compression which might be decreasing circulation in my legs instead of helping. I've only worn them once, I'll try them again and see but I am not happy with them. I am 5'1, 120lbs and ordered size small."
2.0,I was so disappointed. The cut of the dress was so off it was unwearable.
2.0,Not made well. Felt very cheap and the packaging could of been a little nicer.  I would of rather paid more and gotten better quality then spending money on something that will probably break.
2.0,Not to true size!
2.0,these had a strong odor of more than just leather.  I left them outside for over a week in the sun and rain and they still smell.
2.0,I wanted to like this shirt so much. It's a weird material. It's not cotton.
2.0,"Eh. They're okay. I read some negative reviews before purchasing, but figured I would give them a try anyway. They would be better if the yellow part was a dangle and there was some movement, but the backs are solid. Looking at them in person and the way they catch the light when wearing leaves a lot to be desired. Also, if you need a hypo-allergenic earring, these will enflame your ears rather quickly. No solid butterfly back, just a soft plastic push-on backing. Maybe for a Carmen Miranda costume. But these are dollar store earrings and in no way are justified at $8. They're fun though."
2.0,This shirt's sizing is way off. I normally wear a medium to larger. I ordered a large and the shirt did not fit. The large fits more like a size small. Make sure to order at least two sizes up if you still want to try it.
2.0,While these look fantastic on and are a great style the quality is not great. I had two pairs and both broke in the same spot within a month of purchasing. Seems that there is some weakness to the design of the arms of the glasses.<br /><br />It has taken weeks to get a refund or a new pair so I am pretty disappointed.<br /><br />Wish these were more well made because I love the style :(
2.0,I am returning this.  I wish it was heavier and it just didn't fit as I thought it would.  Not flattering on me.  The material is very light and I truly wasn't happy with the quality.
2.0,It’s not as pictured. The color is off and it’s that shiny cheap pajama material
2.0,The shirt is baggy and boxy. Not baggy and 'form fitting' like the picture shows. The sleeves shrunk after one wash.
2.0,Run large and to thin for me..dont like the see through look..
2.0,It got shrink the shirt. Iit was not as described. Not satisfied
2.0,the top of this item was very long and the pants was very short for a size 6
2.0,Soamy rinckle after 1 wasn't and strips came down. And the material made me very uncomfortable down here during workout and sweated even more.
2.0,The clasp is so bad that I lost the watch after wearing it only 3 times. Not worth the money.
2.0,Nice color runs really 2 sizes big
2.0,They're really really ugly and the buckle is weird to use.
2.0,There where to small
2.0,While really cute this hat runs extremely small.  I have never had issues with other hats but this wouldn’t fit my 7 year old son.
2.0,Cool glasses. Works fine. BUT there’s a continuous annoying buzzing noise when I turn them on. any way to fix this?
2.0,"We were very excited to get these goggles as they had the easily adjustable bungee cord.  They fit both my 6 and 9 year old boys well and there was no leaking when they swam under water.  Sadly, the side of the goggle in which the cord feeds through snapped off completely after the third time using them."
2.0,These were all really cute but I couldn’t even wear most of them because some came in broken and others broke as I attempted to put them on.
2.0,The zipper broke 2 days after I received it. Very disappointed in the quality. Sent it back.
2.0,"They’re cute but they are NOT pink like listed, i bought these for my daughter to match my pink ray bans and they are more green and yellow than anything"
2.0,"I bought this watch for my daughter to take to camp, it was broken after falling on the floor tree times  + The watch band broke before she even went to camp. We also have Friends who used it for one month, And it broke.  I would not buy this again."
2.0,"Cute, but too loose to actually wear."
2.0,"Seller keeps telling everyone ""they don't know the size of this product"" because the manufacturer doesn't state it - so not only are you buying blind, but you legitimately don't know what you're getting. Small is huge! I would not reccomend it for lil kids. I'm 5'5"" 100lbs with thin legs - according to the seller, these should have fit me. But I have already taken them in - twice. The items slide down and do not stay in place... The color is great, but the product is subpar. Don't waste your time or money."
2.0,"The product advertises vents, a tail, and pockets on the front.  It had none of these.  I believe they redesigned it and removed these features, but didn't update pictures.  Additionally the back is all black, instead of black and white as pictured.  Buyer beware."
2.0,was way to small
2.0,The magnets on one of the bracelets was backwards so it wouldn’t clasp. The turquoise circle in photo is actually a peace sign; I’m not a fan of wearing symbols. I returned for a refund.
2.0,Fabric is tight with no give. The dots on the sleeve feel clown like
2.0,Runs extremely small. Size guide in the pictures is not accurate. I'm a 30 inch waist. Size small says waist size 29-32 inches and it's more like an extra small. Couldn't even pull it on. Might have to order a large. No stretch to it.
2.0,"Seller should update the description. Even though it ""fits"" the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, it's not compatible since this watch band covers the mic opening on Galaxy Watch 4 Classic."
2.0,I received the bands and they were way too long that I can’t even wear them. I normally wear a small/medium in bands. There wasn’t an option for sizes. Love the colors but too bad I can’t wear them.
2.0,Unfinished and lacks quality
2.0,These are not for dog collars. Non welded D Rings can pull apart if the dog pulls. The other review even says they are not heavy duty.
2.0,Was really pretty for a couple of months - which worked for family photos - but the “rose copper” color was completely gone by 4 months of inconsistent wear.
2.0,Nice shirt overall but incredibly small! I normally would have a shirt like this in XL so it is nice and loose fitting. So i ordered an XL and i can barley button it. Even unbuttoned i am about to hulk out the back. Will be returning.
2.0,This dress will show every little lump and bump. Be prepared to wear multiple pairs of spanx. The dress was way too long - I'm 5'8&#34; and I would have to wear 4-5&#34; heels to keep the front from dragging. I bought this to wear to a black tie wedding and the material is just too thin/cheap.
2.0,Ok quality. The pink ones came stained.
2.0,I thought it was super cute but didn’t get to enjoy it long bc it broke after two days
2.0,Fabric is thick but sticks on your body. That wasn't i expected in it<br />.
2.0,"This set got super pilly after one wear. I hand washed it and used a sweater shaver before I wore it again, but during the second wear there was more pilling. not worth the price."
2.0,"I received maternity jeans.  No front pocket.  They are comfortable, but certainly not what I ordered.  I seriously hate returning things, and if I wear a long enough shirt the elastic panels are hidden.  But, seriously, update the listing so people know they are getting maternity jeans"
2.0,"Unfortunately I did not receive the cute little hat pictured in the description.  I received a large floppy hat with a big bow shape in back.  It's rather heavyweight, foldable, and an unattractive color, appears to be made of cotton-like material that looks like a straw hat.  I give it 2 stars because it seems pretty good quality if you like that style but it is NOT what is pictured.  I'm disapointed because I really wanted the one in the pictures.  I will be returning."
2.0,Advertisd as a sweater. It is a tee.
2.0,"This product was great for about a solid 3 weeks of regular use. First off, I want to say that it does what its supposed to...it keeps your arms cool. At first i thought the quality was superb until the end (towards the wrists) started to rip. First it would be a string hanging that you would cut off, and then next thing you know more is hanging off. One sleeve is completely torn on one end after so much of the material has come off.<br /><br />This is pretty disappointing consdering i only owned it for a short amount of time and literally do nothing but just have them on my arms. Next thing you know fabric just started loosening off.<br /><br />The ones I got had no logo as seen on the product pic. Mines were plain black. Maybe the ones with the logos are better quality?<br /><br />Wouldve been a perfect product had the quality been better."
2.0,They are much too thin & I would have liked them to be a little higher on my ankle
2.0,Very thin material that will not keep you warm. The stitching is very low quality and the thread color is black. Which makes it stand out from the blue and white fabric.
2.0,First of all the dress wasn't a true red. The top of it did not fit smoothly had to return since it didn't look right and wasnt the color I was looking for.
2.0,"4 of the pairs were duplicates so I got 8 sets of different socks, not 12. Pretty lame. Cute socks though."
2.0,Elbow pads were on forearms. Not on elbows.
2.0,Very cut for son but cheaply made broke with in 4 days
2.0,"I like the glasses.  Anti-reflective, computer screen traits are nice.  The only problem is that every one purchased has broken the frame in the same spot on the same lens.<br /><br />Going out on a limb here but either the frame or the lens is a tad bit out of spec and stresses cause the break."
2.0,This bra looks like it would work really well...except I can't try it because the band is too small. Order at least a band size up.
2.0,"This shirt is way over sized.  I usually wear a medium in tops and this shirt is so huge that it looks to be about the size of my husband""s XL shirts.  This shirt is easily 2-3 times larger than the size stated.  The material on it is nice."
2.0,These shoes are so hard and uncomfortable. Not as cute and I was expecting either.
2.0,Received this sweater but it was frayed on the back.  Nice style though.
2.0,"Runs much smaller than expected. Didn't look nice on me, wasn't a fan of the fabric. Not really stretchy."
2.0,"I initially ordered a watch back in May and it arrived promptly, packaged well, with a nice note explaining the product and how many hours of battery life it has. I was thrilled with it! Since I've used that watch extensively, and since I am not taking the test until October, I decided to order two additional watches should my initial one run out of battery in the interim. They both just arrived--turned on!--and the knob on one of them is broken so I can't turn it off. The packaging was terrible and there was no note about the product or even a packing slip. Needless to say, I am not happy that I'll have to take the time to return the broken product and I'm also not happy that the other watch may have been left turned on for weeks for all I know. Who knows when the battery life on that one will die as a result."
2.0,"I order a small and it was still too, too big.  I definitely cannot look cute in this. The top and bottom are too different shades of yellow and the shirt is way too big. When you zip the zipper down, the upper shirt folds down. The bottoms are too big and high waisted. The problem is, it makes you look like you have a wedgey in your coohie. I think the model in the picture had on a small to make it look fitted.  I probably will be wearing the bottoms only.... to bed. On me, the fit looks like you'll go to bed in it. It looks nothing like the picture. I was too hyped about this outfit. I thought it was super cute and unique.  Big mad!"
2.0,"""After opening the box and feeling the belt I immediately wished I would have bought the cheaper ones for $10 less. It's not like the construction was horrible but definitely not worth the extra +$10 than the cheaper ones listed on amazon. Also, the belt holes are very small so I hope you have a hole punch and it acts like Chinese finger cuffs when you try to unhook it, straight ridiculous."""
2.0,disapointed again not what I through it would be
2.0,"I like the hat, but hated that it was packed in a way that it was and still is wrinkled"
2.0,"Material is extremely soft and slinky which I love. Seems to be a good material for working out. However, I sized up as mentioned in description and it still is very tight. I normally wear an XL so I got a XXL and it fits like a large. So if you dare planning to buy this, go up two sizes. I was going to send it back but I’m an hour from a UPS drop off and it will cost me $6 to send back if UPS picks it up🤦‍♀️I am an Amazon prime member."
2.0,I ordered a size small and it does not fit. I typically wear a size xs or small. This shirt would probably fit an average 8 year old girl
2.0,"First of all I should have read the size on these as they are way smaller then I imagined.  When I opened the box, the posts were both pointing down at an angle, not straight back.  I would say they got bent somewhere along the line but for BOTH of them to have done seems strange.  Maybe it's a style I'm not familiar with?"
2.0,"Nice shirt,but might be XL not 3XL"
2.0,Misleading description that this is for iPhones as well as Androids.  The only mini-cord included is for Android phones.  The directions tell you to use any appropriate cord for an iPhone—no such mini-cord connector is included. This item is useless to me if I also have to carry around my own iPhone cord—or purchase a mini one if I can find one.  So deceptive in their description. I returned this item immediately.
2.0,the band faded and twisted. ended up putting a new expansion band  for 12.75....then the battery failed after 3 months.
2.0,"Necklace is nice, but bracelet never arrived."
2.0,These fall down constantly! They fit great and they aren’t see through like other brands but they are super annoying because even walking they slowly fall down...
2.0,"Nice color but awful fit. I'm normally a size small but purchased a large based on reviews. It still fit way too tight around the hips/waist and gave me a &#34;muffin top&#34;, and the crotch was too long. Returning it. I'm 65&#34; and 124 lbs with an athletic build."
2.0,These earrings don't look bad but the post of them is too thick.  I wore them for an hour and had to take them out.  I do not recommend these for anyone
2.0,"The best thing about there is they are warm. I have the blue pair. The worst thing is they are horrible at staying up. Of all my leggings they are down to the top of my butt before I even leave my house. I mean the indecency is bad, but once you are out the door, therr is no place to hide and pull them up."
2.0,It wasn’t comfortable. Mask had unusual fit.
2.0,Got an XL just in case and still barely fits -_-
2.0,Worked great the first time used charged and used the instructed.  Used it 7 times for skirt trips to the store.  Tried to turn it in the 8th time and all the led's are messed up and that is only if I can get it to turn on
2.0,The material is cheap. I’ve only worn mine a couple times and a lot of areas in the stitching is starting to get holes.
2.0,Too loose in some areas and too tight in others
2.0,"It runs big, especially in the chest region. If you are extra blessed in that area then it may be perfect. And I really mean EXTRA blessed. It’s not a dress to wear as a wedding guest. It feels more like a bridesmaid dress for a small wedding."
2.0,"I bought this for my kid and he loves it. Is fresh and confortable, but the sewing started coming off the second time he used it. Very poor quality."
2.0,"Very cheap looking, but will work for what It’s intended for."
2.0,"These yoga socks are a great idea. It's a shame that they don't really stay on well. When I'm doing a pose, they don't keep my feet from sliding. You'd think they would because of the grippy dots, but they just don't."
2.0,"Although this was described as something else, it turned out to be rose gold and was quite pink. As I have the champagne watch this did not go at all."
2.0,Disappointed. Sending it back. Material is 100% synthetic and is very unpleasant to the touch.
2.0,"I ordered a large and though it was labeled large, it fit more like a size small."
2.0,I am not sure if this is a pure silk or not but definitely does not feel and fall like silk. Nice pattern and size but any poly would do it.
2.0,Based on the picture it looked cute. But the print was on the back instead of the front. And based on the picture I thought it was going to be longer. I bought this for my little sister. It’ll work but it wasn’t what I expected. Wouldn’t order again.
2.0,The shirt is at least 2 sizes smaller than the actual size.  I had to return it even after purchasing an XL and I usually wear a M.
2.0,"Quality reflects cost, they are a little skimpy.  If you have a high arch or plan to wear socks I would try a size larger."
2.0,Wants to love this dress. Just not flattering on my body .. kind of see thru also. Color was nice
2.0,"The links get stuck, becoming hard to move and uncomfortable on the wrist. Also, there's no micro-adjustment on the clasp. Though it's a great looking bracelet, I cannot recommend it. There are better ones out there around this price."
2.0,"I thought they looked beautiful online so naturally when I got him here in the mail I was excited initially. I opened my package and looked inside and thought I got a wrong order. They're much bigger than I had anticipated, and they're not as pretty as I thought they'd be. If they weren't as big as they are they wouldn't look as gaudy, and they do look kind of cheap."
2.0,I was not impressed.
2.0,"It is too small, almost for a girl. The material is scratchy. Did not returned it because it was not worth the time."
2.0,"I purchased a medium (I'm 5'7), but it does not fit. It's also very wrinkled and since it's made of a plastic material, ironing and steaming won't get out the wrinkles."
2.0,Quite cheap jersey material. Seems like after a wash or two it would stretch and become misshapen. It is far more low cut than shown on the model. The top size is much bigger than the pants.
2.0,Tha fabric has a good quality but the waistline is quite small.  And the length is quite longer than expected
2.0,"It came smelling horribly of chemicals, and it's very small. The adjustment in the back works to make it fit, but it still looks like a youth size cap on an adult. The color isn't true either. It is much, much lighter."
2.0,It is jr sized it did not fit at all
2.0,"I tried on the bottoms first and absolutely loved them! I got a M and the tag read &#34;48&#34; and they fit my size 6 self amazingly. And then came the top, also M and marked 48 on the tag. Well, it was GIANT. Like no way would anyone ever need that size top with those bottoms. Not only were the cups as large as my head, but the circumference around where it should hug your ribcage didnt even touch me. There was like 6 inches of extra fabric. Im hoping the top somehow got mistagged, because the difference in the 2 sizes was crazy. Such a bummer too because the print is gorgeous and the bottoms actually fit me, which is hard to find!"
2.0,Unfortunately see through 😳
2.0,So tight! Cuts off my circulation
2.0,I have to return it.  It is quite small.  It seems soft and comfy.  But I cannot wear it.
2.0,"My son ordered one, he's a 5' 7 skinny 16 year old. Ordered a large lije he wears and<br />The sleeves are pretty short and it's tight.<br />Ordering a 2xl now.<br />Material feels awesome though"
2.0,This fits weird and is a pain to wash
2.0,This jacket is okay but not great. There isn't enough heated places and the outer shell does not block the cold.
2.0,Don't like the fact the edges roll up and show through tighter fitting pants.
2.0,I bought this purse for my wife for Christmas and she loved it. Unfortunately about a month later the interior lining started unraveling and Coro get worse and worse until she could no longer use it.
2.0,I ordered a medium.  The sleeves were too short and narrow.  There is no stretch in the sleeves and I could not wear anything that narrow and short in the sleeves comfortably.  I returned it.
2.0,"It was considerably too small and too fitted to be called a ""shift"" dress or swing dress.  Probably 1 or 2 sizes too small for a ""medium.  Nothing like I ordered."
2.0,"The chest is super small and tight, it’s 100% see through, the flowers on the shoulder “stand up” instead of lay flat on your arm"
2.0,Cute but there was no lining in the bottom… Returned it
2.0,Fit my daughter okay... but Rips to east my daughter hasn’t even wore it a day and the crotch ripped... and no it wasn’t to tight....
2.0,too hard material
2.0,"The XS are larger then the S. Neither fit a 6 year old.  But the XS fits me great. (I wear size small kitchen rubber gloves.) The size S is a little snug.  Pictures are of my 6 yr old in the gloves. Pink is XS, purple is S.<br />*while the xs is not fit the kids, they fit me so I ordered some for myself. The next box was too small for me, and great for the kids. So I must have gotten a mislabeled box the first time."
2.0,Although 75% of the time Lilly P. size XXS and 00 fit me well…this pant did not fit & was too large for me.
2.0,Very sleek and stylish on the wrist but I had a bit of difficulty getting in one band side though and ended up scratching my watch which bums me out a little but it has easy close when on and adjusts. Hard motions can also easily knock it off your wrist. I literally clapped my hands together and it fell off and my watch smacked the floor.
2.0,"I did not care for the fabric. It was very wrinkled and I don't think wash & dry would take the wrinkles out. The fabric was no ways near satin or rayon feeling. It sort of clung to me. The color and style were great, just do not like the fabric. Sorry!"
2.0,"It is tight on my arms, otherwise fits to size.  Lucky I am short or this would be a mini dress.  Much shorter than shown in picture.  Material print is ❤️❤️❤️. Beautiful."
2.0,"My daughter is 4 years old. I bought this for her to wear this summer in a size 6 and we had to squeeze her into it. Guess I'll have to set it aside for her younger sister. Also, the back material is a light yellow tone, in which you can see her buttcrack when it is wet. Such a shame. We'll have to match it up with a pair of swim shorts and have to cover up the cute little thigh ruffles."
2.0,This looks really cheap. Didn't fit well.
2.0,The sequence is very itchy under the arm and uncomfortable. I ended up returning it.
2.0,"I've ordered this coat twice and still have not received it.  I'd love it but I think someone stole my package.  However,  I found the same one in a consignment baby store and it's wonderful!"
2.0,The whole set runs very small. Couldn’t even get the leggings all the way up. Didn’t even bother trying the bra.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:518256fcb24f03fd80c270e67e8a8d34]] The unit arrived with a scratched and dented box. The instructions are rather messy and not specific to the unit so you have to flip around and figure out what exactly you're supposed to do for this watch to set it up. Listed retail at $700 I would expect model specific instructions.<br /><br />After getting the watch out of the box I realized the second hand was not ticking but was spinning freely (see attached video if possible). It drooped to wherever the watch was leaning.<br /><br />Preference: Face is very large and watch is heavy which is not my style.<br /><br />Definitely not a $700 watch...possibly not even a $70 watch.
2.0,Chain broke within the first 30b minutes of wearing it.
2.0,"La tela, es fea, cómo satinada, parace ropa de abuelita."
2.0,Just really poorly made.<br />-Does not look like the photos (had no lower leg bones)<br />-Not clingy. Loose.<br />-The gloves aren't included.<br />-I got it because it was a 2 day shipping product and it took 4 days.<br />-The paint stuck to itself and peeled off.<br /><br />I'd recommend going to aliexpress and searching &#34;Skeleton onesie&#34; and you'll find much better quality products for less.
2.0,My daughter is a pretty average sized 3 year old. Cute swimsuit but way too small.
2.0,"This dress was much bigger than the dimensions.<br />My measurements are 41 bust, 33 waist, 45 hips and so I followed the size chart and ordered a large. Unfortunately I absolutely SWIM in the dress.<br /><br />The bust hangs and wrinkles if I do anything other than stand straight up with my shoulders back, the waist has a good 3 inches too much fabric, and the hips are even worse. On top of that, at 6 foot 1, wearing 6 in stillettos, the dress STILL had to be taken up by almost 4 inches.<br /><br />The shapes that cover the bust area were slightly uneven, so if you have OCD or plan on embellishing the dress, beware that it will potentially look off kilter.<br /><br />This was my first purchase with CFanny. I ordered it along with one other dress that was amazing. I'm not sure if this dress was a fluke or not, but at these prices, I'm willing to try again and just go down a size."
2.0,Cute but very uncomfortable to wear. I did follow the instructions for fitting them but they still pinched.
2.0,"The sweater is very soft and cozy feeling, looks very comfortable. I will be returning only because it’s larger than I expected."
2.0,These glasses actually were nice as far as cutting the glare.<br />The screw on one of the sides came undone after a couple of months and I could not screw it back in for some reason. Big disappointment.
2.0,"I followed their size chart when ordering and it was not accurate at all, should have gone up a size or maybe even 2.  The shirt itself was long enough and loose in the belly area, but the arms and chest were extremely tight (I was concerned I was going to have to Hulk out of it when trying to get it off...).<br /><br />The material was also very ""cheap"" feeling; it was soft but super stiff with almost no stretch to it - reminded me of the thinner felt type fabric you find in the Dollar Store.  Since I can't wear it I haven't tried washing it to see if that helps loosen up the fabric at all, so that could help with the cheap feeling.<br /><br />The design of it is very cute, but since the sizing chart was off I sadly won't be able to wear it (at least not until I lose some of my ""new mommy/covid"" weight)."
2.0,Way way too short. Barely covers my butt. i'm 5'6 135lbs and my butt is an average size.
2.0,Its ok ..its for work durt/ dust  but not good for rain or snow
2.0,"These are so pretty in person! Perfect size, but unfortunately way too heavy for my earlobes. Gave them to a friend instead."
2.0,"I loved the coat when it arrived, however every button fell off within a few weeks. After a month the pockets ripped out. Very cheaply made, but also cheap in cost. You get what you pay for. On a positive note it is very warm."
2.0,"This item took forever to get to me as it ships from overseas hence the cheap price. It is a really cute bracelet for the money, unfortunately it is really big on my medium sized wrist, it fits more like a &#34;bangle&#34;."
2.0,Bought these for my husband who must wear compression stockings.<br />Although they are soft they are not at all effective.  They had almost no compression and barely came half way up his calf and just slid down.
2.0,One sting instead of two on each side is a bad idea<br />Will not stay in shoulders as well
2.0,"I ordered XXL so it would be a little bit loose; however, I am not sure if the sweater was made to be that way, or maybe it was mis sized. It fit like maybe a medium I put it on to see how it looked before I ran out the door because I was excited, yet as I got it on, it did NOT cover my belly and the arms were way too small!!! I normally wear large and X-large, but ordered 2x. If this is how they are made, I would have needed a 4x!!!<br /><br />Just to give an idea of my actual size:<br />Like, my bra is 36/38C<br />Pants are 12<br /><br />No reason for clothing to have such a wide range of measurements! Ugh."
2.0,Has a nice design. I ordered a small for my girlfriend and that thing fits me fine and I wear a large. It’s way to big for her.
2.0,"I ordered a large. What I received was labelled XXXL and it was still too small for me!!!<br /><br />Buttons are strange, they are shiny in a strange, unflattering sort of way."
2.0,"Scratchy, too big"
2.0,Very pretty but super small after washing.
2.0,Eh. Not really. Even spidy looked funny in these.
2.0,"Ordered XXL, they fit like a large. Very very tight and short on my huge torso. I guess if you're one of the studly types and wear medium T-shirts when you are an XL, these under-sized gems are for you. I now know why they were a daily deal. To the church rummage sale they go. I am Huuge Billy, and these tanks are not."
2.0,"Manufacturing was on the lower end, also runs very small."
2.0,I purchased a womens size XL and it is a girls size XL
2.0,"While this top was cute and fit well, it arrived with stains and streaks down the front of it. I washed it and while it is better, there still is a faint mark you can see when you put it on. Since I washed it instead of just returning it, I am stuck with it. I guess I will use it for around the house. Disappointing since it would have been a nice top."
2.0,The clothing material seems like cheap material and very flimsy. It’s not what I expected.
2.0,"Wore it once, and it broke. Unfixable broke. Super cute on, but you get what you pay for I guess."
2.0,"Went up 2 sizes per the reviews, fits well and is comfy. However, the product DOES NOT glow in the dark. My son wore it all day for PJ day at school, still didn't glow. He was devastated..."
2.0,I didn’t receive three pairs of earrings only 2. Where’s the other pair?
2.0,Fits ok and looks decent but missing the blindfold which nearly defeats the purpose
2.0,"Waaaaaay too big, like comical clown glove big. Not very &#34;cut resistant either&#34;"
2.0,"This shirt is not made to fit a woman's curves at all. It is very boxy, the lines on the shirt are uneven and do not meet up like they do in the picture. I am 5'2&#34; and the shirt is so short it has a very hard time staying tucked in, which is the only acceptable way to wear it bc of the boxy fit."
2.0,Product is small for being a large
2.0,I am very disappointed in these pins.  The lettering is so small that one would need a strong magnifying glass to read it.
2.0,Zipper broke in one of them.. want to return but it may be to late
2.0,The fabric is great. But I asked for an L size and it seems to be a Small or M.
2.0,"The quality was OK, but many labels were out of date and the delta sheet to print new labels was never updated. Very disappointing."
2.0,Looks and feels nice and I used it for a few months.  But the corners broke down and the stainless steel turned sharp and started to tear up the pockets of my clothes.  This wallet might be good as an occasional accessory but it fails badly as a daily wallet.
2.0,Creates uniboob and outer seam is thick and visible through clothing. A little more prominent than a white tank undershirt.
2.0,So pretty but once again too small!
2.0,"I wish I could give this a gods receive, but that would be lying. It broke the moment I put it on, and I have petite ankles! Unfortunately, I can't give you a picture, you'll just have to take my word for it."
2.0,"Nice, but not what I expected"
2.0,Way too small. Runs very small. Very light-weight. Wish they fit.
2.0,not worthy as seen in the photo. ideal for small children below 10. Low quality rubber. Plastic case is not good.
2.0,"Obrained for my wife. She said ""thanks."" It looks fine on her, but the fabric is very light weight, and I fear will not stand up to repeated washings in the machine. The seams were not totally finished well. Overall impression is negative, though the style is unusual and actually pretty nice."
2.0,I used it less than 1 week and the insert that goes in the flap of the wallet ripped off.
2.0,"Quality of the garmet is very good.  However, the heating aspect is very poor.  Doesn't work.  I intend to return."
2.0,Frame is very thin and flimsy. Can be easily bent.  Hinges are stiff and difficult to open and close.<br />Lenses are narrower than I would have thought from the picture and leave gap above and below.
2.0,ordered the 2x and it is too small
2.0,Hats are WAY too big for average size heads.
2.0,"I needed something like this with long sleeves, so when I saw the picture I was excited.  However, when I opened it and tried it on the sleeves come just past my elbows. All the photos show models with the sleeves by their wrists…"
2.0,"I am 5 foot 10in tall.  Returning dress as if I dear bend over, I will be showing all"
2.0,"Packaging did not have any tags, just came in a plastic baggy. Looks cheap and poorly made, very thin material."
2.0,Sadly this skirt runs small. :( Its beautiful. Saving in hopes to lose weight and wear it soon.
2.0,The style was too big. I was looking for the women's version. Guess it would be great for a man!
2.0,Too small. I ordered an XL but somehow it was changed to medium
2.0,"The shoes came in minimalistic packaging, which is totally fine. It comes in a bag instead of a box like your typical shoes. However, the only size indicators on the shoes are stamped in the bottom. Apparently, I was sent a ""44"" which translates into a US Mens 11. I ordered a US Men's 9. It actually seemed like a pretty decent work shoe, however, I  am hesitant to place another order due to the fact that I was sent the wrong size. If I do order again, i will adjust the rating accordingly."
2.0,Beautiful dress but Very tight in the upper body.  Returned it the next day.  Too bad.
2.0,Not as many sequins as shown and they are only on the front. Quality is not good and it took forever to arrive.
2.0,"Returning this item--the belt is very cheap looking and arrived really warped (it is plastic, so of course in shipping it got crunched up).  The dress itself would be cute if it was made of a better fabric that allowed it to hang nicely, but it is just a cheap look as is."
2.0,Great price and may work for some but not for me.  Colors are vibrant but not rich enough to go with high quality ties.  Stitching is cheaply done.
2.0,The pair I received are not reversible.
2.0,Se rompen con facilidad son de muy mala calidad
2.0,I ordered a size bigger than I wear and it fits like a size smaller than I am .
2.0,It was pretty but extremely short and a bit small. I had to return it.
2.0,"I am disappointed that these sweats don't fit me.  They are cut low in the back & smaller there.  Legs fit fine.  Soft and comfy materisl, just way too small."
2.0,Loved them at first until knitting came apart
2.0,Somewhat small around the waist line and the breasts are spaced too far apart for a normal fat person.
2.0,Sizing was not accurate.  The colors on the shorts were just as shown....but it didn't even come close to fitting my husband.
2.0,These were cute and I was excited to buy them for my daughters. Upon arrival multiple sets were broken. I ordered a replacement and the same thing happened the second time. Will not be purchasing again. Disappointing
2.0,"Order way bigger than you actually wear.. I ordered an xl and it fits like small to medium. Took forever to actually arrive also. Have someone make you one, be way cheaper and better quality."
2.0,Returned; too big for my skinny wrists.
2.0,The dress fit fine but the material felt awful and looked kinda cheap.
2.0,Cute. Fits ok. Thinner than it looks.
2.0,Cheap cloth. Didn’t like the sleeves. Returned it.
2.0,"I don’t know why, but the whale shark one is hard to use with a key. It doesn't let me turn the key when it’s on and no matter how far I push it back it won’t work. I had to take it off eventually."
2.0,Bought this outfit to wear on my weekend trip. Love the color and material. Only problem the shirt came with spots on it.
2.0,"For $40, I don't think they were worth it.  Maybe I could tell a small improvement, but nothing life changing."
2.0,I knew it was inexpensive but its cheap.  The snap didn't stay closed and my phone fell out.  I only use in the house to carry phone when I need to use my crutches.
2.0,Cute suit but sizing was way off for me. Too short in the torso and kind of stuff. Too bad. Will be returning
2.0,The dress is a little bit different from tbe picture
2.0,This shirt is really long. I am 5'2&#34; and it is too long to wear with shorts. It also runs large too. Very disappointed as it is such a cute shirt.
2.0,Did not fit my ear without squishing them. Gave them to Good Will
2.0,Very thin and see thru.  It was very small- maybe half the material that is pictured.  I wouldn't waste your money.
2.0,Runs REALLY small. And I waited too long to exchange them :(
2.0,Compre tal la L y me mandaron S.
2.0,"The short are short short, material feel like swing suit material"
2.0,Didn't like this product.  Too soft to maintain shape. I felt it didnt protect the gun.
2.0,Size up..runs very small
2.0,It’s falling apart in multiple spots glue coming apart and just Not good quality
2.0,At 5'4&#34; this was too long for me...the crotch was down to halfway past my thighs and the extra fabric at my ankles was ridiculous.
2.0,Wouldn't stay on my ear. Needs a clip on the top. I use it as a hat pin
2.0,"Not as long as I had expected, very thin material."
2.0,This watch is so cute and I wanted to love it but it stopped working after about a month.  The watch will no longer charge. Super disappointed it only lasted 30 days. My daughter was pretty sad.
2.0,I felt like I had traffic cones for boobs...
2.0,they are great just see through didn’t like that part
2.0,Too big Too Thin
2.0,"Considering the price of this set, I luckily didn't get my hopes too high. I was hoping that just maybe it would be something that would look nice with my wedding dress. This set is very cheaply made and cheap looking. This item could almost be listed as toy costume jewelry, but it's probably not safe for that. The connections of the flowers look like plastic, as shown in the second picture. Oh well."
2.0,Returned this dress.
2.0,My bad I guess because I thought they would be stretchy and they’re not. The SUPER negative is that the seem on the zipper is already ripping. Ugh!
2.0,Looked bigger in photos but still a decent size. Kind of plain looking in person but is durable to the elements and still carries a good amount of stuff.
2.0,"I thought i was buying cotton fabric masks,  when I received them they looked thin, and the material is like neoprene.  Didnt like the flower print, they were blurry.  Couldnt see more details, because each mask is individually sealed, which is good, but definitely not a soft fabric, maybe soft neoprene.  Just not for me."
2.0,Very nice but broke within 2-3 days.
2.0,The toes are so long! My toes won’t even stay in them so I can’t wear them
2.0,"Product seems like good quality,  however I had to give the away. The fit very small"
2.0,This band seems like it might be comfortable. I like how it looks. One end does not connect to my fitbit so I can't use it at all.
2.0,"I often wear Men's XL sizes and they are usually a bit large.  This one was very tight and I might have kept it, except that it is a very subdued orange (I wanted it to increase the likelihood to be seen by hunters) and the back shoulder area is just netting.  Might work for a cyclist, but for a hiker it does not offer the wind protection I was looking for.<br /><br />Warning:  Costs $6.60 to return."
2.0,"I like the color but the material is too see through, it is not flattering at all. I am not returning cause I don’t have time to go through all the hassle. I will just wear it inside the house.<br />Above all, customer service is too bad. Otherwise, I would have given at least 3 stars."
2.0,The material was cheap. This was a disappointing purchase.
2.0,Didn’t really care for it.  It was too big.  Too thin.  The material was not as pretty and dramatic in the front as it was in the back.
2.0,Very long and loose fitting
2.0,Cute earrings but it broke after a few weeks
2.0,I thought they would be more like Swede they nothing like Swede I thought they look cheap
2.0,NO support and the the stickies kept sliding down
2.0,It's cute however the clasp never stays closed. It's made to pop off easily so I'm sure it will be lost soon!
2.0,"I purchased the black and the blue in L & XL, but both of them were tight through the thigh. The XL was super baggy in the waist and belly region, even though the L fit better in the belly, they were way too tight in the thigh and bum areas. Plus the linen was SUPER SCRATCHY! Maybe they would relax in the wash, but since they didn't even fit properly, I wasn't going to experiment. If you're body shape has really skinny legs, no butt, and maybe a little belly, these will be great for you. However, I am more curvy in leg& bum region and not so much belly. Hope this review helps!"
2.0,Poor quality but I guess you get what you pay for
2.0,"Band broke after four months. Average load was 3 credit cards and an ID inside the plates and 5-10 bills folded in half outside the plates. Only gave 2 stars because I think the RFID block works. I tapped my wallet on the register at the store and it didn’t work. Then I took the card out and tapped it and it worked. If you buy this, expect to have to work out your own rubber band. I use three of the thick blue ones they wrap around broccoli."
2.0,La maquinaria sufre problemas se detiene sola y se atrasa el reloj
2.0,"i followed the previous reviewers advice--i am 5'4'' and 120lb and got a small, but they were still too snug for me."
2.0,"I absolutely fell in love with this ring!  I’ve been looking for one for a long time. But after wearing it a handful of times, the rose gold coloring is starting to come off. I do not wear rings washing my hands, or when I’m at home so I’m very gentle with my jewelry. It’s just really disappointing and it’s beyond my window for returns. 😔"
2.0,"My fault, I should have realized  that sizes run smaller overseas."
2.0,The bag does not close.  It is missing a magnet maybe?  Otherwise is a cute little purse.  But you can't walk around with a bag that stays widely open!  The product came late and has a defect!
2.0,Had to return. Could not get the wrinkles out
2.0,"The belt is not what I expected. Super thin, weird way of securing the belt. Not happy"
2.0,Pretty but it is way too small. The fit is really poor and the clasp quality is not very good. Save your money
2.0,The fabric is super thin<br />Looks amazing online<br />Not so much in person
2.0,This is not what I thought it would be some pieces were missing from the necklace.
2.0,Too much Petrol smell. Be sure to wear after dry clean.
2.0,Looks cheap ordered for kid he is happy
2.0,"Not high quality. The pearl string broke very quickly. Sizes are Asian so they are ridiculously small. You get what you pay for I guess. Now, they ALL come from China at cheap prices, don't be fooled, but there are comparable choices on amazon that are both more attractive and better quality."
2.0,Could not get the face clock to work.
2.0,The shoes are cute but only one shoe fits. I may exchange them for a bigger size I guess.
2.0,Not comfortable and sorta big in cup.
2.0,NOT A DRESS!! I didn't even read the description so that's my fault. It's a blouse. I'm 5'9 and have a long torso so i had to wear some shorts with it to cover my butt lol the material is very thin however and I didn't think it was worth $70. You're better off going to spirit Halloween and finding something there
2.0,Comfortable but had manufacturing defects
2.0,Very very light. Not going to be wearing them at all.
2.0,Too small for the money. Picture does not depict what you are actually receiving! DO NOT BUY!!!
2.0,I’m 5’9” 175 lbs i order the large.<br /><br />The shorts fit GREAT. The top was EXTREMELY loose. So loose it is not flattering at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately the material is not soft at all leaving about the only upside is fit of the shorts. They are not comfy enough to sleep in.<br /><br />The color is as described and the style is as described. I do not believe i should’ve order any smaller Bc then the shorts would not fit and the top might?<br /><br />Anyways I’m not sending it back I’ll keep the shorts and take the loss.
2.0,Too nylon feelin.  Made hips look huge.
2.0,This product isnot made to the same quality as the Gen 3 light Thermals issued to me in the Army. This is Sub standard production in comparison.
2.0,The bottoms roll up nonstop and the waist band is very tight but any size larger and they would be falling down AND rolling up
2.0,The shirt was nice enough when I first bought it. However the material shrinks and the lace rips easily. I’d suggest dry clean only if you buy this top. I can’t even put my head in the shirt without distressing the lace around the neck. Wore it 3 times only. I’m not giving it 1 star because it was nice when I first got it.
2.0,This shirt appears to be well made. The fabric is fine. But the fit is totally off. It's two to four inches longer than it should be. It fits narrow around the hips so the extra inches are more of an issue.  The worst thing is the armholes. They are 2-3 inches too large and they expose a lot of bra and underarm.  very unattractive.<br /><br />I have a picture I wanted to add but do not see any option  to do that.
2.0,"Hi, I just received the bag.  Very cute design, however, the color seems to be off.  The red is more of a brown-red.  I know a computer screen does not always depict the exact colors, but in most of my experience, it is pretty correct.  Wondering if this is a knock off."
2.0,Very heavy. My ears couldn’t hold them
2.0,I ordered an XL because that’s where my body fell within the size chart. My dress was probably more like a medium size.<br />I thought the print and color was really cute and identical to what was pictured. It’s a bummer it’s so small.
2.0,Cannot get the clasp to open
2.0,"While the earrings do have a clip, the seller failed to explain that it also has a prong for pierced ears. It is nowhere in the description of this item. People looking for clip on earrings beware."
2.0,Liked the leather and great color. Zipper started sticking about 3 wks in and now broken after 6 wks. Hopefully I can get it repaired because it’s too late to return.
2.0,40G The fit is not bad and if it weren't for the band I would love the bra. The bottom edge is SUPER scratchy. It was really irritating on my skin and I don't see myself ever wearing this bra. I tried to order this to save money and instead I just lost out on $30 and still had to order another.  I don't know why they skimped on that detail when otherwise it's worth the money.
2.0,"The dress looks like the picture generally speaking, but the fabric seems much cheaper that I would expect based on the picture. Does have pockets which is always a plus. Also the leg slit is not noticeable unfortunately unless you actually stick your leg out. Will have to return unfortunately"
2.0,"I returned mine and ordered the Bali U-dahl, which I love."
2.0,may i return please?
2.0,I got my size 3X it fits but I can’t wear it because it’s tight around the arm so I basically have to lose more weight it’s the second time ordering it and I refuse to do another return but buy bigger than your normal size to be safe and get a proper fit.
2.0,"It's enormous, HOT PINK (not corral) and is really wide."
2.0,"Package was open, some lights work, some do not. Not worth the money"
2.0,Beautiful dress! Unfortunately it was more like a size M.
2.0,Neck was too small and confining. Cute design though. Had to return.
2.0,"im at least 5' 1&#34; and i ordered a small. they were too baggy and too big. if youd like to order this, i suggest a size smaller."
2.0,"I liked the style from the picture and the pattern of the blue palm fronds.  When received the fabric and pattern were nice and the boy leg shorts fit very well.  Sadly, the top bra/support area was built like a fortified bullet proof vest!  Massive underwires and extreme padding with visible thick seams that could be seen through the front of the suit.  The fabric was not draped well and looked improperly sewn. If that area had just been natural looking and well-sewn I would have liked it.  Had to send it back.  Refunded quickly."
2.0,"Most ""one-size-fits-all""  size 6-12 socks stretch over my 10.5 EEEE size feet in a way that is uncomfortable and renders them threadbare very quickly. I go out of my way to buy bigger socks. I included a picture of one of these socks, unworn, size 10-13, next to another brand's sock, unworn, also size 10-13, and you can see why I'm disappointed. The quality of the socks seems decent, but I gave them to my girlfriend who is a size 8.5 in womens and she reports they fit well and are very comfortable, except for the ones I tried on and stretched out.<br /><br />Edit: It occurs to me that these socks are available in different sizes and it's possible that they have mislabeled/packaged size 9-11 as 10-13. This might explain the other positive reviews. Either way I would caution anyone seeking 10-13 socks that it may not meet expectations."
2.0,These boots are definitely steel toe not composite toe as stated.
2.0,Cute but the material that touches the face is very uncomfortable. Would not recommend.
2.0,Cute top but cheaply made bad and not proportional. The top was way smaller than the rest of the shirt. Returned.
2.0,NOT TUNIC STYLE SHIRTS! THEY FIT AT THE HIP NOT MID THIGH OR EVEN BELOW HIP
2.0,"looks fake, for the price is ok"
2.0,I really love the fabric and wanted so badly for it to work. I've adjusted the straps and tried wrapping my hair in different ways and no water what it does not stay on my head through out the night.
2.0,"According to the size chart for this top, with a 40"" bust, I should have ordered a Small.<br /><br />Because of another reviewer, I ordered a Large, my regular size.<br /><br />I can get it on but it is ridiculously small.<br /><br />The cuffs are inches too short and it feels like I'm wearing a tight child's sweatshirt. LOL<br /><br />It's really too bad because the color and the quality of the fabric are great.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this one but nope, as cute as this is, I can't recommend this top.<br /><br />I hope this helps you."
2.0,Hard to clasp 2 broke trying to get them clipped in my ears. The others are in for now.
2.0,Love the shirt but was not properly sized. Got a large but fits like a medium
2.0,fits like a medium
2.0,"The material is the kind of material that makes noise when it rubs together. I figured it’d be more cotton and nylon so I suppose that’s my fault for not checking. However, it also ran big in my opinion. The cut wasn’t bad though and it was decent. Just odd material that left me unsatisfactory and what made me decide to donate."
2.0,Did not look like picture. The dress is shorter in person. Good color light weight and cool. Nice dress just not for me
2.0,Pretty dress but about twice my size. I followed the size chart but that didn't work.
2.0,Fit well but image is misleading. Legs at bottom are flared
2.0,"Returned. Thin, too small."
2.0,"If you aren't sure, don't buy it. It's cute but way too small and the fabric wrinkles like crazy."
2.0,"The colors displayed in the picture were not the same colors on the band that I received in the mail.  It is a nice looking band, but I was hoping for it to be purple, blue, and green (my favorite color), as pictured.  Instead, it is purple, pink, and orange (a color I personally dislike), with just a little bit of blue."
2.0,"Yeah, the black finish is coming off now after apx. one month.  Not what I was looking for, but when you buy a count of 50 for whatever it was [under $10 easy], it's kind of hard to complain.<br /><br />I guess I can just keep pulling them out of the bag for a simple house-key keychain for dog walks.  That wasn't the initial idea, but evidently rather hard to make just the actual keyrings with a process to keep their finish for - ? - a year maybe?  Or there is no market for them.<br /><br />Black oxidized perhaps the way to go, but I haven't found any out there."
2.0,Appearance is very nice. The clasp is a bit cumbersome to lock sometimes. The watch doesn't keep consistent time. I replaced the battery and it still doesn't function properly...sometimes it stops and sometimes it slows down. Unreliable.
2.0,"Look nice but WAY too small. I am a 36, wear a size 8 jacket so was surprised that they were so tight."
2.0,Feels thin and cheap. Much shorter than the picture shows!
2.0,the more the material stretches the lighter the color in those areas. :(
2.0,Frame hurts my wife's ears.  Would not purchase again.
2.0,Big but it looks cheap
2.0,Nothing like picture very bulky and cant read the inside at all do not purchase
2.0,"I like how these look, I like that it's waterproof and can use it on some rain, or snow, but my feet got pretty cold (even while using winter thermal socks), so, not recommended for long outdoor walks.<br />I had to replace the insole cause I was getting tired too soon while using these.<br />I'd return them if possible but I guess I hesitated too much."
2.0,"I normally wear skechers but these I found to be very loose fitting and the heel is short I think as they keep slipping off my foot, otherwise they are very nice and I will fit a heel grip in them and hopefully this will sort out the slipping off,"
2.0,This is NOT a sweatshirt - - it is a slimey feeling synthetic and runs very small.
2.0,Fits too tight and fabric seems cheap!
2.0,"The leggings fit and look good however I don't think I agree with the description of fleece lining.  I bought the fleece lined leggings expecting extra warmth and thickness but these really only have one layer, no lining."
2.0,fit large. material was very stiff and see through.
2.0,Cute purse but it came without the long strap which is the only reason I bought it. Also has a funky smell in the inside.
2.0,"I ordered 2X, which is what I wear in almost everything I buy. However, these are very tight on my legs."
2.0,I bought 3 shirts. Same size. Different colors. One fits perfectly. Another is tighter but still wearable. The third one doesn't fit at all.
2.0,These shoes are sooo cute but size up! I ordered a size up and still waaaaay too tight.
2.0,"Didn't make it thru my Departure flight. The size was great, the idea it slide on my luggage handle was what I needed. It Separated from the seems in 3 places."
2.0,"I attached a photo of these bibs on top of a 0-6 month bib. While these are supposedly for ""toddlers,"" as well as babies, they are so small. My little guy won't get much use out of these before they will be too little to actually work for his teething drool. Additionally, the snaps seem like they won't hold up well to repeated use. They feel as though they could tear through the fabric.<br /><br />The pros are that the fabric is soft and the patterns are super cute. So if you want these for looks, go for it! If you need them to be functional, look elsewhere."
2.0,"I love the look and feel and the compartments inside.  The biggest issue is that the hooks go inside the flap and pull the flap open all of the time.  For that reason, it is not as usable for me.  Looking for a solution."
2.0,Zipper cam apart first week and seams can undone after about a month.
2.0,This bag really looked cheap. I returned it.
2.0,"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and I ordered size small. The top part of this romper looks huge on me. It looks like I am wearing a table cloth. When I lift my arm up or even put my hands in the pockets, I can see my skin and bra showing through the sleeves. I also don't like the fabric at all. It has a stripy texture and shimmery look. I think this would look better on someone with a fuller figure. I am skinny and got lost in it."
2.0,Didn't fit like I thought it would.
2.0,These are great quality but the length is way too short.  Does not look as pictured. Fits more like a capri length than pants
2.0,To dark
2.0,Too short.  I'm only 5'2&#34; and these didn't go to ankles.  Very didapointed.
2.0,Overall it was alright — the thin poly cotton you come to expect from some brands on amazon — and it was a cute print... but the neckline was so weird. Like kind of wide but also tight at the same time? I couldn’t take it so it was returned :/
2.0,"The pink glasses are completely transparent and have no mirrored quality whatsoever. The blue lenses are mostly mirrored, but aren't as cute as the pink and I planned to use them as a back up. They do come in a nice drawstring bag and have flexible stems that are easy to adjust."
2.0,"Very cute print, but way to thin and straight. I normally wear a small or x-small, but tried a medium and large because I knew I had to order up with this one and it was still to tight. Both sizes are being sent back."
2.0,To snug on my Fred Flintstone legs and feets.
2.0,"Cheap, not worth the buy. Broke after the 3rd time of use."
2.0,I should have read reviews better.  Keen is known for their generous toe box and the big kid size 6 has always fit my 7.5 women's but they are a bit wider than women's most commonly which is why I have so many pairs.  These are just painful.  Not what I am accustomed to with Keen at all.
2.0,I didn't like the fit.
2.0,Lost a mitten within a month of use.
2.0,I usually wear a 1 X or sometimes a 2X but I like sweaters to be large so I ordered a 3X. There is no way this is a 3X. It is oddly proportioned. The top is slightly too large but the bottom doesn't fit with the top. I can't button. What a shame. The style wit the buttons on the are could be attractive if the fit was good.
2.0,Was expecting an xl received a l.
2.0,"I so wanted to love this top.  I ordered large, too small.  and oddly the upper arms were really tight, I've never had that problem before in a top.  It's going back"
2.0,Very disappointed...I know it's faux leather but usually faux leather at least looks like leather...this looks like plastic...and it STINKS!!!! I was so disappointed as this was supposed to be a Christmas gift....the jacket stunk so bad that when I opened the box it smelled like a dead animal and chemicals in there
2.0,"This bag is no more leather than I am a Victoria's Secret vixen.  How they dared to call this thing leather completely baffles me.  Talk about a bait and switch.  When I opened the shipping box a horrid chemical odor hit me.  I am not going to keep it because I cannot have this in my office because of how that chemical odor emanates from it. Even now the bag is at least five feet from where I am and I can smell the awful odor.  The bag is soft (a kinder description for flimsy af).  The color is nice, but the material reminds me of what restaurants use for booth bench upholstery.  Blecch!  I gave it two stars for the color and the fast shipping.  The bag is awful."
2.0,"It cute but dont wear it if you working around house(like cleaning ,cooking...) bc it breaks easily"
2.0,"I found them to be uncomfortable, like having hair constantly pushed behind your ears. Also, they start to lose their shape in warm weather."
2.0,Was going to wear it as a cover up over a long sleeve top. Sleeves were to tight. Ended up giving away.
2.0,"very cheaply made, metal is scratched and poorly cut with rough edges. very sad because the picture makes it look so cute. big disappointment on this product. actual product does not look like the picture. not worth returning, but wish i could get my money back. was going to give as a baby shower gift, but not with hope cheap it looks."
2.0,"Had to give shirt away, Thier idea of medium is too small. Not going to bother ordering a larger size."
2.0,Holds hair back that's about it
2.0,I've worn these twice and they already have 2 small holes in the inseam area.
2.0,"Material is very cheap and dress is just oddly shaped. The inner fabric flips over and hangs on the sides and around the chest area. It’s a very boxy dress, with absolutely no shape to it. It might work for a tall woman with a very straight body shape. Honestly, feel like it’s just a wide peice of fabric I need to make and shape into a dress. Thank goodness I’m not bad with a sewing machine."
2.0,The sleeves are weird! Too tight at the top (I ordered a size bigger just in case) & too loose around the wrist. Skip this one and find something else
2.0,super thin
2.0,Was looking forward to finally having this style of dress in yellow but it wasn't worth it. Quality is totally subpar
2.0,"I like how the color looks just like in the photo. However, I did not like the fabric. The fabric is not stretchy and it'll shrink after you wash and dry."
2.0,"Do not waste your money. While it certainly is a mask, it isn’t a Duke mask. The color is completely purple and the texture is also off."
2.0,Really cute but too small. Had to send back.
2.0,BREAKS EASILY.
2.0,I feel like the color of the shirt looks much different than the image and quality of the shirt as well.
2.0,Odd fit. Color was not the Christmas green shown in the picture.  Returned it.
2.0,It is not the same as that shown in the picture
2.0,I’m 5’2” and this was way too short for me. The front piece of the dress was too open and revealing for my liking. The dress does not wrap in the right places.
2.0,The one size fits all is too small for men.I ended up giving it to my mom.
2.0,This is not red says pnk right on package tight 18
2.0,"The band is actually quite short, and it pinches my arm hair.  Not recommended for adult human arms, or any other mammal."
2.0,"Bad quality control. I guess you get what you pay for. I normally wear a med., so based on other reviews, I got large. The nude one feels fine, but the straps on the black one are like 2 inches shorter. So it is unusable. Maybe I'll give it to my 11 yr. old daughter rather than trying to return.<br />The material isn't that great either. They will be scratchy very soon. This material deteriorates after time. What did I expect for the price."
2.0,It works too well the mag. Does it’s Job even when you don’t want it to like trying to TAKE THE THING OFF!!! You have to fight two magnets that were trained by shaolin monks in the deep bamboo forest of china!!!<br /><br />And a small piece of the Cain link is poking up and snags on everything!!!!😡. But other than that Im still use it until I get a different one sooo… to each is his own.<br /> Hope this helped bye 👋🏾
2.0,"When I first tried them on, they fit perfectly and looked great. I loved them instantly and was happy.<br />Right after trying them on, I machine washed them on the gentle cycle. But when they came out, the threading on the crotch area pulled apart, leaving a gaping hole. I'm thoroughly disappointed in the construction and durability of this item.  Other people seemed to have received a pair with better quality, but I guess it's just a gamble on this brand. :/ I'm going to go back and stick to my usual brands Nike and Champion."
2.0,I wore these just like I wear my other readers and the frame broke within a month on one pair. I haven't used the other glasses yet so not sure what kind quality they have.
2.0,"Very small. Fits my 8 year old. Great quality, very warm and comfy feeling."
2.0,So not like the picture. It’s a cheap long t- shirt. I have thicker shirt's than this dress.
2.0,Smelled odd. Fit weird. Did not work w/planned outfit
2.0,"The picture its not accurate and I think it's not flattering, and it feels rough, not soft"
2.0,"Way too small, these seem to be junior sized. I'm 5'11 and and couldn't even pull these all the way up. Not a lot of stretch and fabric is very thin/flimsy. Thank Amazon for free returns. Received at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
2.0,"Cute, but only for weekend wear. Thought material would be more suitable for  Fall. Snug fit."
2.0,"I don’t like the waist line. There is a 1 1/2in band that goes around instead of just tight fabric all over.  They ride up and at the same time squeeze your thighs.<br />I’m 5’4, 135lbs I bought medium."
2.0,This is a good jacket it’s warm<br />But the zipper broke right away so Not the greatest quality
2.0,Great design but cheap material and sheer
2.0,"This is really cute and lightweight, perfect for early fall. It seemed to fit okay except for the arms. The arms were very tight, so I was planning on lengthening them. It seemed to fit okay otherwise until I wore it out. It hardly covers anything when I sit down and it rides up really high, This showed off a lot more than I wanted. It flies open when there's a slight breeze and feels like it's open to everything waist-down. The first day I wore it, I was on a little bit of a hike. I wasn't hard on it at all, but the buttons kept stretching every time I squatted down. The last button actually popped off, this was during the first day of wearing it. I really wish this would have had a better fit and the buttons were sewn on better because otherwise I really like this dress"
2.0,"Didn't fit very well, didn't last very long, but I expected that"
2.0,"I really like the idea of these. Not all of the ends stayed on, I lost half of them in the shower. Do not plan on purchasing again."
2.0,This is great if you don't intend to move otherwise it rips very easily. ripped after only wearing for 10 minutes when I reached for something.
2.0,"Really short, thought it was longer. Ordered an extra large, they shipped me a large. Not satisfied."
2.0,Shorts were too large and baggy. We’re not flattering at all. Used as a rag. I guess ordering smaller might help but then they would just look right and baggy
2.0,The product was fine but manufacturing causes a clasp to come off. No big deal as mass production causes problems like this a lot. I messaged the company to return the item and they began getting very rude and talking to me as if I were a child. I understand not wanting to do refunds but if that's the case offer another option on the page like replace or even repair.
2.0,Beautiful shoe but I found it ran narrow
2.0,"I ended up returning this item because there were many defects. Small hole near the right hip on the seam, many caught strings on collar, pockets and body of the dress. I got the light pink button up cardigan and am very sad it was so beat up, because the color was gorgeous, and I liked that there was some sparkle on the collar part. Also depending on how you wear it I would say the size chart is accurate, but I wanted to wear it as a dress so I wish I would’ve sized down because then it would’ve been more like a body con/sweater dress and would’ve been SUPER CUTE. but overall needed to return because it was not worth the $20 for how damaged it was."
2.0,Kids sized glasses but for the price I can't complain too much. They fit my 9 and 12 year old so I guess they are getting an unexpected present.
2.0,"Fit is nice but the red is not as deep as expected. Will be returning for a different color. For reference, I am 5'2 165lbs and ordered a medium. (I am bottom heavy)"
2.0,"The chest is way too small. The cut runs about a size small and it seems short in the very front, making it unflattering if you have any tummy."
2.0,"The dress is very nice.  However, it is much looser than the picture appears and it fit me like a moo moo dress and I am a size 9/10."
2.0,The 5t seriously looks like it's for a 1 year old
2.0,They are super cute but scratch VERY easily
2.0,"Not a tee spring T-shirt, fit is too large and not as soft and comfortable as other tee spring shirts I have bought"
2.0,"Very sheer and short sleeves for being a long sleeve dress (for reference though, I am 5'9). The neck is also very low."
2.0,Item was attractive and arrived on time- was NOT thick or warm and my daughter had to layer a hooded sweatshirt under this coat just to stay warm.
2.0,"WAY TOO THIN AND FLIMSY, I WOULD HAVE RETURNED THEM BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME (OUT OF TOWN) AND HAD TAKEN THE TAGS OFF.  I GUESS ITS OK FOR LAYERING IF THERE IS A BRA UNDER IT AND YOU DON'T SHOW THE STRAPS AND JUST UNDO A FEW BUTTONS.  IT DOES NOTHING TO SUPPORT THE BOOBS OR HIDE THE BELLY.  NOT AT ALL FIGURE FLATTERING AS SOME OF THE THICKER BRANDS ARE. I'M SURE I'LL FIND SOME USE FOR THEM."
2.0,bar is too long for tragus
2.0,Sizing is completely inaccurate
2.0,It will be given away to someone with a waist half that of mine. No way could it sit on my hips as in the picture. Pity because it is so nice and soft.
2.0,"It’s super thin and feels cheap and design isn’t symmetrical, also see through and runs large. If you buy a small it fits like a medium"
2.0,This hoodie pilled really bad. The design is cool.
2.0,After machine washing these the dreaded lint balls grew on these pullovers. I thought the polyester would make these more durable. I was wrong! Very upsetting. I was billing these would be my go to pullovers.
2.0,Feels and looks cheap. But you get what you pay for. But I won't even use this it's so bulky and ugly. I recommend it only if you have a giant grandma purse and really don't care that everything you own is grandmaish.
2.0,"I returned this hat ..it's very nice, good quality, nice looking, but it's intended to fit a giant ...I have a reasonably large head but this hat sat on it like a large mixing bowl (!) and would need two other hats under it to make it fit."
2.0,I wanted to wear this dress for a tea party I was attending. But it ended up being a little too small for me. They need a better sizing chart.
2.0,I bought the 2X and I wear a 2X in everything.  Item is too small all over - tight through the hips - not comfortable at all.  Order the next size up if you are looking for a &#34;loose and comfortable fit&#34;!
2.0,"😑 Not a favorite. This oversized cardigan is poorly made with many uneven stitches, short and loose threads that threaten to unravel at any time - so aside from the color (a rich wine color that is really lovely), I would not recommend this cardigan."
2.0,"Too big for my daughter, I had to return it.."
2.0,It looks beautiful in the photos but it doesn’t look or feel nearly as high quality in person. Will be returning them.
2.0,Two other large Champion shirts ordered at the same time and from different suppliers were normal sizing.  Don’t feel like this is a true Champion product.
2.0,Was missing the main pull. Also the color was a more pastel version of coral. Not my favorite but seller refunded quickly.
2.0,Sin marca. No me gusto la tela.
2.0,It broke as soon as it was put on
2.0,"This outfit was paper thin and for the price I felt it was definitely overpriced for something you'd only get 2 wears at best in. Nope, definitely wasn't impressed and I returned it the next day!"
2.0,"I really liked the length of these tanks. I was hoping they would work for me! However, after wearing one for a day, the lace at the bottom was separating from the thin material of the tank top. I returned these for a refund due to the thin material and flimsy lace. The quality was not what I expected."
2.0,Not great quality hat. Design in front like it would not last very long
2.0,"The material is very soft and pretty, however I purchased this for protection and to meet mask requirements of some public places the fabric is more mesh like and would require additional mask to provide protection"
2.0,they are a petty design but such cheap quality..like something from the Dollar Store..certainly not worth the moey
2.0,Not what I expected but ok for the price
2.0,Muy pequeños inclusive los de adulto no estiran y son muy cortos
2.0,The thighs are HUGGGE not alittle thicc it’s a weirdly huge jump from the waist to how large the thighs of these pants go. I have worn XS S most my life I know I’m a small person but I don’t have a flat butt or small thighs for my weight and they fell off me
2.0,There was a little damage in the left glove.
2.0,I didn't like these as much as I did the others.  What I didn't like was the black oval in the back.  It didn't help bring out the color of the Amethyst.  It should have been a lavender or a silver.
2.0,They’re ok but not scratch resistant
2.0,Very pretty earrings however they do not stay closed resulting in losing them multiple times because they fall out.
2.0,Extra tight in the groin but legs are much longer than expected. I'm 5'10 and they go past my knees.
2.0,Shirts run smaller than what is detailed. Should of bought a size bigger
2.0,Difficult to latch or secure.
2.0,"I got a size medium and this shirt did not fit well. The sleeves were okay and I had a little bit of space in them, but they were sort of short. I am 5'8 1/2"" tall so tall girls keep this in mind. The top overall was way too small. It stopped right under my boobs. I feel thats completely too short for a top and wouldnt even look right if I put a shirt under it. I do wear a size D/DD in bra. I would say this shirt is for average-shorter size women with a smaller chest. The material was okay, nothing that would keep you warm though. The color was a vibrant black."
2.0,"The beige is made out of greige muslin! That’s the fabric that designers/seamstresses/tailors use to drape and make mockups, slopers & patterns for clothing. It’s like the fabric equivalent of scratch paper and it’s not meant to be worn as clothing because these days it’s made with inferior (short-staple) cotton fiber that won’t stand up to repeated washing and wear, and you can rip it with your bare hands. I was taken aback that they’d actually made this & sold as an actually wearable garment. It’s a shame because the actual cut & fit of the garment is beautiful so kudos to the pattern-drafters. And the buttons are beautiful & high quality oversized mother of pearl. I just wished they spent less on buttons & more on better fabric not greige goods."
2.0,"Way too small and on top of that, I'm being bombarded with emails to leave a review."
2.0,Super cute but had to return because the small was WAY to big!
2.0,"After careful review on wikipedia about international laundry symbols it turns out the symbol of a circle with a P in the center means &#34;dry clean only&#34;.  Not for a 7$ tee shirt.  Ever.  It does have a washing symbol also, but nothing about whether you can dry it or not.  It is thin fabric, if you have lace pattern on your bra it is going to show.  The necklace was very cheap plastic and did not even match the shirt in color.  It reminded me of the type of quality you get at a dollar store for a child.  That said, it looked cute and flattering on and fit as expected.  I have high standards for wash and wear of tee shirt quality clothes so I will be sending it back."
2.0,"I love that these pants have pockets. But they run short, and they don’t seem to take well to being washed and dried (maybe they were meant for dry clean only?) they were a little short to begin with but they shrank and permanently wrinkled. The material shrank and bunched and they are so unflattering now. I wear these on days when I just don’t care. I bought another pair that were beautiful but had no pockets. I thought these would be the same but they’re a totally different style, cut and material."
2.0,"Daughter absolutely loves the shirt, however I feel as though it definitely runs small.<br />She’s 12, a women’s small typically hangs off of her. It fits her very tight and more than likely she’ll only be able to wear it this year."
2.0,The shoe is pretty but there’s no support when your walking. My foot kept slipping out.
2.0,"Ordered ""36"" it would not go past my hips. I usually wear 34 waist pants. Unless you are a skinny and have no hips these should fit. Terrible description on these. Would've bee. Perfect otherwise. Thin and not so big around legs. Returned"
2.0,"These are definitely not compression as advertised. They are very comfortable and form fitting, just no compression."
2.0,The top fits perfect. The pants are ridiculously large. I will have to send it back. Please watch the sizing. Ordered as a gift
2.0,Kind of junky looking.  Not proud to walk around an airport with this cheap looking bag.
2.0,Way too small order two sizes up. Coat looked and felt decent
2.0,"The belt's color was off from what i saw on the web site, i thought it was going to be more on the butterscotch side."
2.0,Good quality t-shirts but they run small...best 2 size up 1-2 sizes
2.0,I love the purse it’s beautiful but the smell on the inside is just awful! I have had bounce dryer sheets in it since I received it but it isn’t helping now I smell the purse with a hint of bounce! I don’t know what else to do I like the style so much I would have bought other colors but I can’t stand the odor.
2.0,Returned. Ran small
2.0,"This item is more of a Baby's bracelet, it will not even fit a slim teenagers wrist.<br />I will be returning it."
2.0,Doesn’t look quite like the picture.
2.0,"The zipper broke the first day I wore them which stinks because I liked really them until that happened.:(  Other than that, beware that the back pockets are small (in case you don't like that look.)"
2.0,Didn't like style or baggynest. Returned
2.0,"Seems well made, a great color, and perfect for many reasons except you need to order a size bigger than you normally would and/or measure. I measure preordering and still have to return to order the bigger size"
2.0,"I thought the scarf was thicker than it actually was. Colors are rich and pretty, just not a high quality made scarf."
2.0,"The bag is very pretty but it doesn't hold a phone. I had to carry my phone with my bag, still the bag is pretty."
2.0,Sequins fell off
2.0,Was very thin and ran smaller than I thought reading other reviews
2.0,I bought these earrings in several colors & two pairs already had the posts broken off. They look cute but break much too easily.
2.0,If your feet swell don’t buy. If you order a size up they’ll still be close on the toe. They’re just meh
2.0,"Beautiful, but the back fell off shortly after I started wearing it and I haven't been able to find it since.  It also hurts to sleep on because it is pretty large."
2.0,Plastic case started losing its silver steel luster making it look used up. The band also looks like it’s losing its luster.
2.0,I didn't like the material. It's not good quality.
2.0,This shirt has potential to be nice but it just isn't. The sleeves are way to tight for me. The neck buttons are really oddly placed and are just stiched on they don't really work. Overall the shirt is just too small should have ordered a few sizes up I guess. The fabric where the floral strip is..  is odd... it's just odd. Wouldn't buy again but if I did I would size up a couple sizes.
2.0,Didn’t see a size of the ring at purchase and so it didn’t fit the person as a gift
2.0,"Just got it in the mail, the golden tree of life the amber color is nice but in picture the speckles on the bottom of pendant is green the one I have is black. That was the reason I bought it the color combination amber and green. Unfortunately I am sending it back. Your picture is deceiving not true color"
2.0,These are beautiful but way too big for my kid. They fit me better than her. She will grow into them eventually but too big for right now.
2.0,"I purchased this purse Nov 24, 2017 and the handle has already ripped out of the side.  Very disappointed."
2.0,This dress was very pretty but I did not like the belt. The belt would not stay in place and was too bulky for the dress. The sizing was way too tight on the top. I am not a large size peron and this dress was still too tight on top.
2.0,"I was excited about getting these glass. I had bought a smaller pair and they are very durable. These bigger frames are nothing like the smaller ones. They don't feel like they are made of the same kind of plastic. They creak all over when you move them and the plastic feels very fragile. I am not sure if i'm going to use them and risk having them break, than having to pay for a different brand and getting lenses fitted for those as well. I really wish they make teen and adult sizes made with the same material as the glasses for the younger kids."
2.0,"Hat is decent, not the greatest or worst quality but doesn't fit a normal adult sized head too well. Sits very high. Having to return unfortunately."
2.0,"So pretty, but many of the gems look like they are about to fall out."
2.0,I sent it back.  It didn't fall properly.
2.0,"They are pretty but they change everything you see to be green.  Also, I'm pretty sure they aren't actually polarized.  I did all the tests and they failed all of them."
2.0,Knee reinforcement stitching is rough on the inside.  Chafing after just a few minutes of walking.
2.0,I loved these mittens but the standard size was way too small!!!
2.0,It’s a cute set but the shorts are a size too small and the shirt is a size or two too large. So while wearing this set you’re never truly comfortable or look put together. Also the draw strings in the shorts came out in the wash and ruined another shirt of mine. You’re better off buying pjs irl
2.0,"it's kinda small size.. it fit more of little girl from 10-12 years old... too small, does not fit for adult."
2.0,"Kiddo had a hard time adjusting to going to school and we bought this locket as a comforting item to take along. It's absolutely adorable and kiddo loved it! Unfortunately, after about a week of daily wear, the locket began to pop open and now won't stay closed :(. Super bummer. I think even the slightest misalignment of the hinge causes it to stop working. We'll keep tinkering with it to see if an adjustment can be made."
2.0,"It's very pretty definitely stamped 925 silver, nice sturdy snake chain, however it is much smaller of a pendant then it appears even on the image display model. From a distance you would never know what was hanging around your neck. Probably better for a young child not an adult just kind of gets lost. Which is a shame because it's really pretty."
2.0,"According to the different reviews on the subject, there must be a variance in the effectiveness of the magnet to hold in place. My new band simply slid open with every movement of my wrist, that is, I had to tighten it every few seconds. Would work well on a mannequin."
2.0,"Cheap fabric with unsewn portions. As an example the under dress is a very thin weird felted synthetic that doesn't have sleeves. The hood is not attached to the cape. The belt is cheesy and not realistic looking. The velvet is the 99 cent store costume variety, a thin velvet look that doesn't have any warmth."
2.0,"Awkward fit, not form fitting at all and much larger than I expected. Looks like a bag with a design on the bottom."
2.0,"Ordered this skirt twice - 1st time in a medium and the 2nd in a large.  The skirt is adorable but being 5' 3&#34; and about 140 pounds, I did not like the fit of the skirt in either size and will be returning both."
2.0,"Substandard quality, color and softness."
2.0,I read the other reviews and bought a 5x. I&#34;m 5'2&#34; about 150 and this sweatshirt is a tent on me.
2.0,I liked the face best.<br />The 1st shirt strap where the long main strap goes through is too short--the long strap cannot fit through -- only the 2nd shirt strap is usable.
2.0,The piece of metal that holds the little message on the key ring broke after about a week. Super disappointed.
2.0,"Cheaply made and doesn't lay in body as expected, looks like a drunk person made it"
2.0,I like the color was not true to size
2.0,Colors looked good but the hat was much larger than expected and did not look right because of it.
2.0,"*Note: Received this product in exchange for an honest review*<br /><br />This is a very pretty, nicely put-together dress. The seams are nice, the cut is nice. On my daughter, however, it definitely fit small. I usually buy her a size 10 in most clothes, but (as I remember) I picked a 12/14 for this selection, and it  *just* fits her. She has absolutely no growing room. It's tight on her chest and falls to mid-calf, not her ankle as in the picture. The sleeves are tight on her arms. She can wear it, just barely. Worst, it doesn't fit her in a way that she's comfortable in, unfortunately, so it's not a dress she's going to pick up on her own and go around in. I don't know if I was sent a wrong size, as the dress has no size tag in it, but I was somewhat disappointed, as it's a very, very cute dress in the picture."
2.0,Will not hold as much as pictured. Zipper broke off after three weeks
2.0,Really dark yellow fake looking
2.0,Tarnished within a day
2.0,Beautiful dress and well made but it runs large and is cut very wide. I am 5' 7&#34; and 115 lbs for reference. It looks gorgeous; the color is perfect and the sparkles don't go anywhere but the dress is so wide you can't see me beneath it.
2.0,Not stretch and they should specify the size they’re very small like for kids
2.0,"For workouts, casual wear - Tai Chi etc."
2.0,THE BUTTERFLY IS BIG LIKE 3 INCHES WIDE AND 2 INCHES LONG. TAKE THE HOLD FRONT OF YOUR NECK. TO BIG FOR MY TASTE..
2.0,They didn't come in a box or with instructions like they said
2.0,Definitely one of those you get what you paid for moments.<br />Cheaply made. Didnt even try it on the fabric was awful.
2.0,"This material is too weird. It's not quite like the spandex we all know and love and the product runs REALLY SMALL... it does stretch to fit, but it isn't worth it, you loose the lookwhen it stretches too far..."
2.0,"El color y modelo bonitos, lastima es muy pequeña"
2.0,Not horrible but not good quality I am on the shorter side but they were much too long. They ran too big so I ended up not using them all that much on my trip to Iceland.
2.0,"I read the reviews that the jems fell out,  so when I bought it I expected to have to glue them back in,  but it was missing two jems when I opened it and I can't find any in the box or the bag it came in. I'm very disappointed in this. However, I'm very crafty and I will find someway to make it work."
2.0,"When the top is washed the fabric gets all ""pilly"".  So disappointed!  It was so cute!!  If it was only made out of a better denim fabric!!"
2.0,"The product I received , ""Women's Casual Blazer"" versus what is advertised here are not the same. Please remove the picture of this product and add the real one. They're completely different fabric and pattern!"
2.0,"It is not as pretty as it looks in the pic, the rubber is not very soft but ok, it was cheap."
2.0,I like the color but is pretty thin and see through! And is not very forgiving! It will show any imperfections!
2.0,Used once on a recent trip and already there is a tear at the seams.
2.0,"Update: It did actually come completely off when I was in a lake. I did ultimately find my watch but only after the water killed it.<br /><br />Original: Very comfortable and a good fit, but the band keeps coming undone. Thankfully it hasn't fallen off yet because it stops before completely opening, but it's really annoying as it can happen a few times in an hour sometimes. I can't figure out how to make it stay on, or why it's not secure."
2.0,"They are too small, I can feel the end/back digging into my heel. My feet are not wide by any means and these feel too narrow and overall, uncomfortable. Returning."
2.0,I was really excited to get nice sweaters for work that were actually fitted. However this one was obviously faded throughout the sweater (see pic) . I thought it was dust or something (not that that would be good either) bit it wasn’t. This happened to another dark green one of theirs I bought as well. Such a bummer! Also not true to size. Suggest going up one size.
2.0,Pretty dress and design but it seems to be made for a child. I ordered a large and it looks like it would fit a 8 year old child. Disappointed.
2.0,TheShirt is much lighter than a navy blue. If you are looking for a true navy blue this is not it. It is more of a light blue.
2.0,"I mean, I guess you get what you pay for, it's okay the charm is really small. I wouldn't order another one."
2.0,These are fashion glasses not really an eye protection. My daughter is sensitive to light and these are not helping much.
2.0,I'm 5'3- 5'4 and the pants were way too long.  They also made me look huge
2.0,"It feels cheap, and fits weird. Its supposed to be a small and fits like a large."
2.0,Total waste of money.  It's as thin and flimsy as paper. Won't buy again.  Delivery was fast.. but product no good.
2.0,"I agree with other reviewers, these are much too large for an average woman's wrist. My wrist measures 6.25"" at the level where I wear my smartwatch. These bands sat much higher up my forearm where the circumference is 7"" (and fell right down!) Unfortunate because they are really nice looking."
2.0,To small. Even.on.ybe.largest setting the hat doesn't fit. There should have been a disclaimer when I bought it that this product is small and not a one size fits all
2.0,the tide in the back to adjust the hat broke
2.0,"Beautiful colors that will look great in any season.  But... there's no pad holder!  And due to the odd spacing of the rings,  I've not been able to find pockets or dividers to fit it, which are a must for me. You need pockets."
2.0,"Material isn’t denim , more they legging"
2.0,This is a disappointment.  I Just received this and it's okay but not as vibrant or as luxurious as MK original bands.  The quality is lacking so it looks very cheap (more like a MK wannabe).  Comes with the band adjustment tool and extra Quick Release pins.  I will probably return it and find a watchband with a better quality look.<br /><br />When attaching the band I noticed that one of the quick release pins is different than the others and mades it very difficult to attach the band to the watch.
2.0,I went by the measurements and ordered an xlg. It is more like a medium. I will be giving it away.
2.0,The sleeves are cut extremely short
2.0,Their so cute but very flimsy honestly if they were real and durable this would be a 10!! But they are worth it
2.0,"I really like these toe rings, but within a day toes have turned green where they were worn."
2.0,"I bought this as a gift to myself because it's so cute and dainty. Six months later it's not what I expected,  it's starting to tarnish even though it's supposed to be sterling silver.  Too late to return it but I will never purchase from this company again."
2.0,Didn’t like it.
2.0,"something about the elastic or the thread at the finger holes is uncomfortable and starts to cut off my circulation after a while, plus they start to get those little fuzz balls (ya know like on sweaters?) after a while... good for a couple cosplay pics, but i would recommend a different brand if you plan on wearing them for an extended period of time"
2.0,One pair missing the 2nd earring.  Another pair had no gem stone
2.0,This looks a knock off to a jersey.  Cheaply made with iron on letters. It’s just “ok” for the price but it is NOT a REAL jersey.
2.0,It a lil long but its sexy!!
2.0,I bought the right size.  But the length of the suit was too short and there was not enough coverage at the top.  The body of the suit was nice and had a bit of tummy control which was nice.  The floral design is deceptive in the picture.  It appears to be embroidered but it is stamped on as they do on children's t-shirt.  Really cheesy for an adult swimsuit.  I returned the item.
2.0,"Material is stiff, cheap and has no stretch. It was tight for me across my upper chest between my shoulders."
2.0,Nice looking vest but the quality of the material and zippers are not very good. You get what you pay for but I would say this should be maybe a 20$ life vest
2.0,Ok so I live in California in a beach town and wear sandals most of the year. I bought these as my last leather pair are falling apart.<br />I usually wear a size 11 and don't think I have a particularly wide foot.<br /><br />The Size 11 were very tight in the straps and my heel was almost hanging off the back.<br />Looking at this sandal and my last pair (which I thought was Reef) this one is way more narrow than my last pair.<br /><br />Decided these and the other pair of Reef's I got are going back and I am going to a retail to figure out which ones are wider
2.0,Runs small & it’s definitely see-through. I thought it would have a thicker waist band too...
2.0,"I got these socks to help with edema in my legs, since I tend to retain water and it all goes into them. They do work well in keeping the swelling down, but after only a few days one of the socks formed a large hole in the toe section, requiring me to patch the hole up before using the sock again. Since then even more holes have formed in the sock, around the same area as the first one. Besides the holes in the front of the sock, the rest of the product is working fairly well, thus the two stars instead of one star."
2.0,Very cute but they don’t wash well. You have to iron them straight out of the dryer so she doesn’t even wear them anymore.  I don’t have time to iron.
2.0,"This is too small for my husband. It is very pretty, just too small."
2.0,"I like the color.  I like the way it falls.  BUT, I can't recommend it because it is very delicate and snags way too much.  If you never plan to get your fingernails caught in it, or your purse, or your car door....buy it.  It's lovely.  I killed it after one wearing because I'm clumsy and got it snagged on way too many things."
2.0,The little woman cut and hemmed the sleeves and shortened the length but the robe is still really heavy.
2.0,"I've purchased the same shirt in 4 different colors and same size, this one in particular is extremely large, I'll probably just use it for a sleep shirt since I cannot return it."
2.0,"You get what you pay for here. The bracelet is very cute, but it's very cheaply made. It literally broke 5 seconds after I put it on! I was able to fix it myself, but definitely a disappointment. Shipping though was fairly fast."
2.0,Zipper on back pocket broke after a single wear. This was my second pair. Then first seemed decent enough so I thought I’d purchase another. Will be the last time though
2.0,socks were great looking but entirely too tight at the calf
2.0,"We bought this as a christmas gift for my mother in law. I think it looks cheep and is incredibly to big. My husband thinks she might like it, but I don't think its worth it."
2.0,This bracelet fell apart 1 week after wearing it!
2.0,Cute but broke right away. Chain is garbage
2.0,Cute design but doesn't lay flat.
2.0,Hat is warped. The bill is off center and out of alignment with the rest of the cap. Unwearable.
2.0,I ended up giving these tops (I got 4) to my Mom as they were WAY TOO SMALL!!! I ordered XL and they fit like a S/M!!<br />The tops are cute but it sucks that I can't wear them!!!!
2.0,"The lens are to dark, with the black frame<br />get a 2 star. and the frame are a little bite to big if you have a small face"
2.0,too big falls off
2.0,Because the necklaces come wrapped on a card they are creased. After months of trying to straighten out the kinks I finally gave up! I might just trash them because I don't know what else to do.
2.0,Wrong colors were sent (not as advertised)
2.0,I loved it at first and still wear it around the house. But the neck hole stretched out almost immediately and nothing keeps it on my shoulders so I'm constantly pulling and adjusting it.
2.0,too small for my change
2.0,Beautiful but runs small ugh I wear a 2x from almost everywhere sad.
2.0,Way too expensive. The description wasn’t specific so I assumed it was a big box considering it’s around the price I usually pay for the big box from Walmart. The pack I received is regularly $7 to $8 at Walmart but I couldn’t return because I did need them. Other than that they fit my children just fine.
2.0,"I was looking for some loose fitting shorts for biking and walking with the kids and ordered these. I liked the hiking appeal and pockets plus elastic waist. I have a pretty big bum and heavier legs so short shorts don’t work for me, but these were quite large. I ended up returning them because they felt like men’s shorts and were not flattering. I may have kept them if they were about half the price that I paid, but for the $25ish spent, I wasn’t going to wear them enough."
2.0,They are pretty BUT two of them fell apart 2 days after wearing them<br />The metal balls at the end came off.. disappointed was hoping for better quality
2.0,They are not very bendy the strap comes loose all the time.  Not A huge fan of them.
2.0,"The materiel is cheap, thin, and itchy. I was expecting it to be over-sized, which it is; but the bottom is sewn weirdly. It's not strait as in the picture but is bunched or banded"
2.0,"The picture on the front looks like it was printed on and not good quality, slightly faded looking. Not like picture"
2.0,"Unfortunately these dontblook good if they get flipped around in your ear,  and the fringe isn't cut uniformly"
2.0,Glad I only used as bedtime attire.  Sloppy fit shows body parts too easy.
2.0,Strap broke within 3 weeks of wearing.
2.0,was not flattering on me at all
2.0,Very cheap. Had trouble zipping up the zipper
2.0,"Disappointed. Color is not like pictured at all. Very green & dull, None of the Labradorite flash you hope to see.  Sad."
2.0,Too small for anything but petite feet and very cheaply made. Fell apart bbefore could even get it out of the package.
2.0,I like the texture but way to bi
2.0,Not as expected and runs very very small
2.0,The pants don't just run large. They run huge. I know I would like them if they fit properly.
2.0,This was an absolute beautiful dress - I loved the feel and the color of it. Unfortunately it was way too small in the arms and across the chest area and I wasn’t able to wear it. I did give it as a gift to my daughter.
2.0,They're completely see through.
2.0,I got a large and I should have gotten a medium. And I truley don’t know if this is a teal licensed Spider coat
2.0,"Beautiful dress, I was sent the wrong size. Ordered a Large and got a Small."
2.0,"This is huge. I’m 5’9” 165lbs and I ordered a large. It completely swallows me. Also, several reviews said they wish is was a little longer, but I found mine to be almost too long, which as a taller girl, isn’t usually the case. I gave it 2 stars because the material is nice. I’m returning it and there is no free returns with this item....so I will have to pay the return shipping cost. Wish is would I have realized that before I purchased or I never would have bought it."
2.0,"I bought an XL for my husband.The fitting of the shirt was good but the length of the shirt was too short. I had to return it. He is 6'0""feet and his weight is 210 pounds."
2.0,"This came to large.  The waist was ok, but there was tons of extra fabric in the crotch area. Oh i also didn't notice till receiving, there is no drawstring."
2.0,Feels terrible and is not made in America - knock off
2.0,"Really thinking about returning this item , the fabric was similar to muslin cloth , order size smaller."
2.0,This item broke after using only a handful of times. It was open and I heard a pop and it won't stay open any more.
2.0,I’m a plus size women and I usually expect boots to fit tight b/c my feet are a little wide. These shoes fit very loose especially at the ankle and the heel felt like it was about to pop off.
2.0,It's an XL an I swear a little girl should wear it not an adult.
2.0,"The quality,  like most products from that country"
2.0,Sizing was off and the material was not as expected.  It was almost like wearing a sheet.  Returned.
2.0,"Was excited to use these, but turned out to be too large for me (5'6""130 lb. female), fell down during activity."
2.0,"i loved the look..it ran somewhat small , a lil snug around the hips ..i think I got a returned item..there was no tags on it and  it had a whole at the seam..I was disappointed in the quality !"
2.0,This is more suitable for a toddler...under 5 years of age rather than the advertised 5-13! Very cheap material
2.0,I was hoping that this would help with my sons anxiety but it didnt. I ordered the small which was tight on my 3 year old and the medium which was too big.
2.0,With-in the 1st drop it broke and the linds popped out and the medal was misshaped
2.0,"This wallet is huge! I expected it to be the same size as a regular wallet but this wallet is unnecessarily big as it fits the same ammount of cards that a slimer and smaller wallet would fit.  the wallet itself barely fits in my pocket.  I remember when the first dash came out and the concept was to minimize the size of conventional wallets and I thought they would try to design this wallet the same way but its exatly the opposite. Having owned 2 versions of dash wallets including the first version I bought off kickstarter, I can really say dash is going backwards.  Two stars because I like the design and the material but the size is what i dislike about this one."
2.0,"I like the feel of the fabric.  It is sort and cozy.  The seam at the knee came apart at the very first wearing.  Since I do sew, I will mend the seam and continue to wear the sleep pants. Not happy with seam construction."
2.0,"They fit somewhat loose in the Oakley frame, but what can you expect for the price?"
2.0,"I love the idea of this dress: cute design, Gatsby-esque, etc.I tried it on and had to change immediately. The sequins are extremely uncomfortable and the dress is REALLY short."
2.0,"I really like this hoodie! Unfortunately however it's way too long for me i'm 5'7&#34; (170cms) and this hoodie while it fits my upper body very well where as I'm a 36 chest .... i have to say I am not pleased at all with the length. I was hoping for something that sits on the hips  more but this is so long that it passes my butt! Well while i do have a fat butt, this looks weird on me, because it kinda makes my butt look bigger since it flows over my rear it looks like i'm wearing a dress sorta, so what I have to do is hike it up on my hip which caused the excess fabric to roll over and bulge which looks stupid because it makes me look like i have a big beer gut lol.... it's not a pleasant look TRUST ME!... if you were 6 foot and taller this would work great for you guys, but with me not at all pleased! I do have a longer lower body and shorter upper body, perhaps if your upper frame is longer it might work! GOOD LUCK ON YOUR PURCHASE!"
2.0,"Although I like the cap (the SF Giants cap), it is not as advertised.  The description says 100% wool, but the tag in the delivered cap says it's only 15% wool.  Also, the picture has an orange button on the top, like the players' hats have, but the delivered cap has a black button.  I reported these issues to Amazon over two weeks ago, but the description and picture still haven't been changed.  I also found another review that mentioned the same issues before I did.  BUYER BEWARE!"
2.0,"Companies should double check materials before putting products on the market.<br />Please do not make people buy trash, drop it yourselves in a dumpster."
2.0,The material is a LOT thinner than what I expected - not very well made.
2.0,I ordered a kids size 5 and it’s got to be a mans size 5. It’s huge. I got it for a Christmas gift for my grandson and I am so disappointed.
2.0,"First of all, the shoes shown does not even look like the ones I received which were way to small. However, they will make great doll shoes."
2.0,It gets stuck in one mode and won't turn off without taking batteries out sometimes
2.0,"Although a very pretty color/pattern, the dress wasn’t as I expected. It was very short, it didn’t fit and didn’t look like pic. Didn’t fit like a maxi dress at all where they normally hit the floor.."
2.0,Love fleece and the length as I am 5'10&#34; and 130 lbs. The issue is they fight tight on the thigh and even with my height I have to keep them pulled up to almost chest level. They have a very long crouch and it is impossible to  get them to fist right in the crouch area. I am constantly pulling them up. I do not recommend these to anyone.
2.0,Not resistant
2.0,"I like the way they look and I'm stoked for when I can actually get them in, but the flares are wayyy bigger than I thought they were going to be. So they're no where close to fitting right now. I'm at 3/4 and I'm probably going to have to size up just to get them in. I'm scared they won't come out if I put them in though, honestly."
2.0,Wings came in with strap broken also the black glitter that outlined the wings was inside the wings. Very cheaply made
2.0,"Very pretty, but broke not minutes after putting it on."
2.0,This covered one of my nipple look like something my three year old can wear.
2.0,"I'm 6'0"" and they are quite a bit short."
2.0,Order a size larger than you think you will need..Very narrow..and if you have socks on it's crowded..
2.0,"Color and print great, but appears to have been seen unevenly, causing a &#34;weird&#34;, somewhat twisted fit. Also, has a straight hem, which doesn't have the graceful, flowy look of my other kimonos."
2.0,They were beautiful (a little big) but I could barely pry them open and once I did was concerned how I would get them on and off. I have never experienced this before with earrings.
2.0,The shape of this top is really cute but the issue is that the white portion of the top is extremely see-through. I would have to wear an undershirt and that would make it too warm to wear here in Houston. So I am returning it. :/
2.0,It wasn't for me.. was way too heavy and thick... the fit was a bit loose and I ordered the small. I returned it.
2.0,I've bought many other dresses by ACEVOG and this is the only one that's too small :( I'm sad but at least my daughter will have a pretty dress when she gets older
2.0,Fabric is rough and trucks are stiff. Nothing like modal. Quite disappointed by the misleading description. Look elsewhere.
2.0,"Very disappointed in size. Not able to see these well if you have long hair, too small, lightweight hooks bend easy. Pretty but need to be a better grade of silver/heavier and larger stone for an adult."
2.0,"After wearing it only once there were sweat stains on the outside white portion of the hat.  That should not happen.  Fit is fine, but upset with stains. RJF"
2.0,to boxy
2.0,Description said they come with suspenders but did not actually come with suspenders
2.0,Very comfortable but the strap on the tank top broke the second time I wore it
2.0,Can't Stand the material
2.0,"Cheaply made, I don't recommend."
2.0,I like the color but they were tight and seemed to fit smaller than the black pair the I purchased which fit perfect. I was a bit disappointed as I wanted the color variation.
2.0,I like my necklace. It arrived promptly and appeared to be what I ordered. My pearl fell out after about 2 weeks. I was grateful I was at home when it happened and did not lose my pearl. I had it repaired at a jeweler for an additional $10.00.
2.0,It did not fit as expected
2.0,Don't care for it too much.
2.0,Though I only rated them two stars as one of them came apart on the first wearing.
2.0,"I've placed the magnet inside and placed the fae diamond on the exterior. After letting it there for only a few seconds, it immediately lost its connection and fell out. Get what you paid for"
2.0,Did like very much.
2.0,the fit is just weird.
2.0,Such cheap fabric
2.0,"material is too clingy for me, I will wear it as a nightgown,"
2.0,Bottom hem came apart first time wearing the shirt
2.0,My daughter and her bestie lived these necklaces but they both broke within the first week.
2.0,This &#34;one size&#34; is not one size. Maybe in juniors. It's going back for me. Don't recommend this if you are anything bigger than a women's size 4
2.0,This necklace is way too small for the price. I love the look and how dainty it is.. but the price?? Ridiculous
2.0,Pretty but incredibly small. Photo made them look a lot bigger.
2.0,To stiff and way too small. Sizing is way off
2.0,"took over two months to get, and then when i got, do not like them"
2.0,Fall out fairly easy. Too small to really add a bend or curve to keep them in place.
2.0,the metal loses color and unravels quickly snagging clothing...
2.0,"The tie under the bust was too tight, I couldn't even fit this over my head to put on! I was very disappointed. It should have been expandable in order to put on then tie tighter once on."
2.0,Size XL. Too tight in the sleeves. Returned
2.0,The band is kinda cheap I don't see this watch lasting very long.
2.0,Don’t look the same
2.0,I have a high arch and these shoes do not fit me comfortably.  Definitely long enough but no arch - or at least not a good  enough one for me.
2.0,Had to return because the material was SO thin you could see everything right through it. I guess it that's what you are going for....
2.0,Had a very strong chemical odor and fabric was thinner then expected.
2.0,If u have big hands not recommended..
2.0,"The product is ok, but what I didn’t like is that it isn’t compatible with a screen protector. I returned them."
2.0,"It’s true to size but it definitely isn’t the best quality, expected the material to be different<br />Just not Exactly like the picture"
2.0,For $10 the quality is not good. The lips are not detailed like the pictures show them to be. This is a birthday gift and I don’t know if it’s worth gifting.
2.0,"pockets are kinda small in comparison to how giant the pants are. Not sure what happened, ordered the exact size I always wear in pants and I could probably fit two of me into these."
2.0,Style is great but unfortunately they broke after my first use. Disappointed
2.0,They fit very nicely but after on 3 times wearing them they have ripped in the inner seam as other reviews have said.  Plan to call them today and hopefully get a replacement
2.0,Fits weird I regret buying this dress....😐
2.0,Beautiful ring but stone already fell out
2.0,I usually wear a true medium with MTB/moto gloves and these seem to run a size or 2 too small. They seem to be great material and the pattern is awesome. Disappointing
2.0,The leather suspender holders are very thick and difficult to get used to. I compared with other suspenders I have and these are twice as bulky.
2.0,"I don’t like the material. It fit wierd, so I returned."
2.0,"Colors are OK, material is OK.  My biggest problem is that the characterst are NOT embroidered, they are silk screened.  For the price of the hat, I expected embroidery.  This is the kind of hat that gets handed out at racing events to mass audiences."
2.0,Very thin and tangles with almost no movement.
2.0,The plastic end pieces on this band are very cheaply made and do not fit the Fitbit very well.
2.0,"the shorts are cute, but the size was not correct. The sizes run smaller than they are."
2.0,Too small and I missed the window to return. Not happy.
2.0,This dress was super cute in the photo. It does look like it says it’s going to look. However it is very thin. And the top portion for the breast area is very loose so you will have to wear some sort of undershirt or Bandu
2.0,Not like what it is on the pic
2.0,Bow fell off after a few times of wearing it. BOO!
2.0,"The dress is an xxl and is a bit too big which is not a problem.  I love the fit.  What I don't like is the pattern is upside down.  I should probably return the dress because I will never wear it the way it looks.  Quality assurance folks, check your products.  Seriously."
2.0,"Charms are too large. Gaudy. Gift for a child,perhaps, with no interest in good quality workmanship. A toy, and not a great bracelet."
2.0,"The item is definitely not as robust looking as in the picture.  I was wondering if it was plastic even.  It's pretty enough but the heart is very thin and flat, the links are like that of an actual chain and not at all intricate as it looks.  The heart has fallen off twice.  NOT worth the price and quite a letdown."
2.0,"It's a nice, soft sweater, but it's several inches shorter than the photo shows --  the photo makes it look like the back is mid-thigh length, but that just isn't true:  it isn't even ""butt-covering"" length.  I returned it."
2.0,"The gown itself fit okay, but the hole where your head goes through was extremely small and it fit tight around the neck, which is uncomfortable."
2.0,"A number of these have &#34;rotted&#34; (best word I can think of: they easily pulled apart into pieces in my fingers). This was a structural failure in the nylon/poly webbing material itself, not the stitching/etc... the webbing loops at the ends through which the metal ring routes just shredded into scraps under very light finger pressure (pinch and pull... rrrrrip! in a cloud of little threads).<br /><br />Don't know if this is due to age, heat damage, defective material, or what.<br /><br />So far, only about 50% of these are viable (though those that are viable seem to be nice little items). Take this into account when evaluating a purchase (i.e. they are effectively about twice as expensive as they appear to be)."
2.0,"I wanted to love these because of the compression and lovely color, unfortunately the leggings roll down and do not stay up. I ordered a small about 150lbs, 5' 1""."
2.0,Pretty color and roomy but it didn’t come with the strap and had a funny smell
2.0,Cheap....bad cut...just awful....
2.0,They were ok for what I paid for them
2.0,"Had to return it because it’s definitely made for thin people. The material is that stuff that clings to your body, add that to the fact that’s it’s super tight and you can see every dip, muffin top, and belly button indented in the dress."
2.0,Looks good but traps water and sweat on your finger.
2.0,One of the lights fell off when I opened the package.  The batteries to the lights are also dead.  Well that’s what I assume.  I don’t have any batteries to replace them so I don’t know if they are dead or if the lights just don’t work.
2.0,There is no support for the bust line. Also this &#34;sports bra&#34; feels and looks like a swim suit.
2.0,"The fabric is unacceptable for my taste, and carelessly sewn. Causes bunching and uneven seams. The green color is hard to distinguish from black—not at all as pictured."
2.0,"I was QUITE disappointed. While these earring/crawlers are very pretty, they are NOT as described on the selling page - they are literally HALF the size stated.<br />Page states they are 2-inches long, by 1-inch wide, when in reality they are much smaller at only 1-inch long and only ½ inch wide! They looked like little children's ear climbers, that's how small they were! Certainly no where near the size being advertised, as you can see for yourself in my photos."
2.0,It was actually over size...to big
2.0,These are pretty but too small.
2.0,"I loved the color of this suit and was really hoping for great things, but I've got a very long torso. At 5'10"" this did not give me enough length and left my chest needing more coverage."
2.0,Way too big and very sheer!
2.0,Bra area is kind of small of you have big Brest. But like the way it looked on me.
2.0,Great looking watch but it arrived not working!  Very sad as it was a birthday gift.  I ended up returning it because I had to get another watch right away for the gift.
2.0,they dont help you drive at night i found my self lifting the glasses more than using them
2.0,"This dress did not look bad on me, but it didn't look particularly good either. The material is VERY thin so if you have a toned body, you probably won't mind that. I on the other hand have lumps and bumps I would much rather not put on display so this dress was returned. Besides the very thin material, the chest area was way too loose."
2.0,I loved the pattern of this dress and despite it being pretty long I considered keeping it. The thing that killed this for me though was the fabric. It felt incredibly cheap and not soft at all. I couldn't get passed it enough to keep it
2.0,"As a bra, the cups are way too close together for an older woman for whom they are advertised."
2.0,Sized small. I where a 2xl and bought a 3xl and its still to small.
2.0,"Sunglass shield OK, but the could fit better. They need another quarter inch so my glasses fit just perfectly."
2.0,Didn't hold its color in cold water wash. Recommend washing by hand
2.0,Too small at the waist makes it not suitable to wear
2.0,"The seam connecting the arm to the body was (literally) nonexistent, with live stitches ready to unravel. I'm sure the girl/woman who sewed it tried her best, but even with my lowkey tailoring skills I have to return/replace it. It's true to size, comfy and cute; just wish it wasn't irredeemably defective."
2.0,Came in a little plastic wrapper!! Very tacky presentation. Clasp on watch is defective.Very difficult to close.Will be returning product.
2.0,"I read the sizing wrong and was bummed until the product arrived. I wear a men’s US 9.5. The slipper size I received is a men’s 7-8 or a women’s 9-10. However, this size slipper fits my size 9.5 feet really well. They are extremely comfortable. I love how easy these are to slip on/off and the solid, non-slip rubber sole that allows me to go outside, if needed. If it were just me, I would give these a 5 star because they are so very comfortable and fit really well. However, I docked these slippers a star because, as others have also said, they run at least one size too large. I will also note, even though they are made for men or women, my wife said the toe is so square and wide that even a much smaller size would not look good on her feet.<br /><br />Update: I’ve worn this slippers now for 2 weeks and am very disappointed. To begin with they run large but now they have stretched out so much that they flop around my feet. I can’t keep them on. I lowered my 4 stars to 2. I plan to give them to my son who’s has size 10-11 shoes size but suspect they will keep stretching."
2.0,Love the dress on the site but in person it looks cheap and fit big.
2.0,"Is cute in all,just too small."
2.0,"Ok, so I got these sunglasses without realizing they were also reading glasses, because I paid more attention to the picture than the words, and also because who's ever heard of such a thing? I'm a lifelong reader, and my inclination to sit in full sunlight and read a book is nil, because the breeze will blow the pages around and bugs will land on the book. So even if I needed reading glasses, which I don't, I wouldn't use these things because I read indoors like most of humanity, and my lamps are not as bright as the sun. These are for someone who reads on the beach, I guess...?"
2.0,"Too short, definitely not a maxi fit and I am 5'3"
2.0,"I was disappointed that when we got ready to leave for our Halloween party, my husband hurriedly put on the shirt I got for him, only to find it's too small. This is not an XL. Make sure to go up one, maybe even 2 sizes."
2.0,Warm but they pill easily
2.0,"Eh, this dress does not look like the picture.  The material is like a swim dress, not cotton-like.  I’m 5’0” and the size small is way too large and not flattering.  The print in person also looks a bit old lady-ish and cheap looking.  Would not recommend."
2.0,"I love the look and the fit.  I would easily give them 5 stars if the paint did not cause skin irritation.  I've had 3 pair of these, different colors.  The first pair's paint started to peel a couple of months after I got them.  This by itself didn't bother me, but the paint started getting into the skin above my nose and between my eyes and caused bumps and rash.  The only way I could make it go away was to quit wearing these sunglasses.  I ended up giving all three pair way.  It's a shame, too, because I really did love the colors, fit, and styling of these.  I won't buy them again."
2.0,"These shoes are too large. I ordered a size 9, the label says “Size 9”, but anyone can tell by looking at them that they are larger. When I tried them on they were way too big. I have about two inches of heel exposed. I’m sure they’re actually size 10, or maybe even 10 1/2. Another bad feature is that the soles are heavy. I want my flips flops to be durable, but I have many pairs that are lightweight and have lasted for years. These are the types of flip flops you drag all over the place, scraping your heels as you go. I know they’re supposed to be orthotic, but I’ve had plantar fasciitis and the heel needs to be boosted higher in order to help. You can also have a sole that is molded to a foot with a healthy arch support that isn’t so heavy. I would not pay 36 dollars for these."
2.0,I got this 2 pack for my daughter and myself to wear at night in hopes of preventing tangles in our curly hair. The band that goes around the face and head are too tight on both of us. I am an average sized person and my daughter is petite.
2.0,Are not scratchy but too little for average male
2.0,The timing was okay but the after i got it when i went to put it on the lace came off the anchor and it was hard to put back on
2.0,Had the wrong size label attached
2.0,"My son will be 3 in a couple of weeks, he fits 3-4T depending on the cut. I accidentally ordered a a 3T, contacted the seller and asked them to change it to 4T. They were accommodating, but when it arrived, it was HUGE! A 7 year old could wear this thing. Cute, but the sizing is off."
2.0,"Bought these unbreakable shades to use while kayaking.  Came with head strap and sturdy case, but are NOT dark at all! Does NOT block sun! I'm thinking of buying some tinted window film to put on inside to block out sun."
2.0,I was super stoked on getting this item don't get me wrong it shines like a diamond but this mask is gigantic!! If it was smaller I would have definitely have kept it
2.0,"Pretty, but not as durable as I expected.  Ordered several and some arrived in pieces.  Disappointed."
2.0,"too small ! buy the bigger Doleesune 40 Hiking instead ! way more pockets, larger capacity, and not much heavier !!"
2.0,Very  tiny  can't see the words and broke 1st day
2.0,Wore them 3x in the back yard and they broke apart. What a waste of money. The pair I purchased at my dollar store last summer are still all together !!
2.0,"Loved these, but I bought them in September and it is now January and they already have a whole at the seem on the thigh where they wore out. I wear size 12 and I'm pretty fit so it's not that they don't fit properly or that they should have worn out due to excessive rubbing. I wear all my jeans once a week and replace them as they wear out. I reserve my ratings until I realize how long they're going to last. I paid $10 a month to wear these four times a month."
2.0,Not good quality and one bracelet came broken.
2.0,Material not up to par with what I expected from the seller or the advertised photo.  The material was a very see through cotton material.  Would not recommend this product.
2.0,All the shoes ordered are for  Xmas gifts and as of this posting the individuals receiving the shoes have not seen or used them.  The overall rating can not be justified until the individuals receive the shoes as gifts.  Response can be given after the holidays.  So sorry for inconvenience.
2.0,The heat is there BUT they turn off by themselves. Will be returning.
2.0,Simply don’t get hot enough
2.0,"the scarf is good, however, it SMELLS HORRIBLE. I don't know how it was stored but it seriously smells like mold."
2.0,The bottom looked like a diaper on me
2.0,This arrived with the letters peeling off. the material feels cheap and is not soft at all. Super disappointed.
2.0,"I’m giving this two starts because my kid loved them while they worked. But it only lasted two weeks before the lights went out, changed the batteries thinking that would be the problem and only one started working for 3 days before those lights finally died.<br />The kid still likes the shoes even though they don’t light up anymore, just wish they had survived at least a year."
2.0,Would be pretty but runs 2 sizes too small. At least. I wear a 1X. I ordered a 3X so it would run huge and comfy. It was tighter than you could imagine. Unable to wear.
2.0,"Wanted sooo badly to love this dress. Cute style & cut. The material is awesome, too! It is just way too large. I purchased small and style is unflattering on me. For reference: I am 5’7, curvy, size 6. Sadly sending back"
2.0,"I've been wearing this for a little while now, and I realized that I'm uncomfortable whenever I have it on.  So thinking about it a little, first off, the color is not what is in the picture.  The picture looks to me like a pale pinkish-beige, but the actual item is straight up khaki-colored.  It also looks from the picture to be a finely woven garment -- (like laceweight or fingering weight yarn), but the actual item is a thicker weave, a DK-weight yarn.  So, I thought I was getting a delicate, gently draping, pink-tinged sweater, but what I have is a thick, chunky beige cardigan.  But the thing that bothers me the most is that it's itchy.  Both the material and the tag.  The tag was really uncomfortable, so I cut it out, but the ends are secured with thin, transparent fishing line which I can't cut out without destroying the sweater, so I'm stuck with it.  In general, I really wanted to like this, and it hasn't been awful; it just wasn't the same as displayed in the picture, and the tag is driving me nuts."
2.0,"They are very cute and pretty. I got complements. However, the one with the pearl, which I put in my right ear, started to feel burning and itching almost immediately. I took it out after just a couple minutes, but my ear got more red and swollen all day. It finally went away overnight.<br />I give it 2 stars because they look like the picture. Too bad they're impossible to wear."
2.0,"I read a review that size slightly small. Normally, I wear an XL, with no bum, so I ordered a 2XL. They are really SNUG! I'm a prime member; when I placed this order the shipping dates changed...Hhhmmm so I paid EXTRA in shipping. Duped."
2.0,The white was pale yellow. Returned.
2.0,I thought these bracelets were beautiful and well  made. Only two days of wearing without messing with it and it started to fall apart. Only happened to one bracelet so far but it was pretty disappointing.
2.0,I’m 5’9 brought a large an the waist is a little tight for a large… the bottoms are good for a fitted look but the pockets took me by surprise lol it’s literally no room to hold your phone!! I might just were this indoor or jus for working out… not for casual outings.
2.0,The ruffles on the shirt are different on each side 🙁 was a gift but don’t want to anymore.
2.0,"Glasses arent very large at all. Just regular size glasses, and i got a big head."
2.0,"My daughter purchased it. Color (orange) is very cute, however the fabric is cheap. Looks too shiny! So disappointed, prior to seeing hers, I wanted to order a different color, but will not be ordering one!"
2.0,i like it i just need a bigger size
2.0,"holes were above knees, in the incorrect place and very uncomfortable. could not wear sent back"
2.0,Had these for one year exactly. With seasonal use they didn't not hold up. They come completely apart while on vacation.
2.0,"This product was a big disappointment. The fabric<br />is warm and fuzzy and the choice of colors is<br />fantastic. All is great with this top until the 1st time<br />you wash it.  The crimson color is not color fast so it runs ruining the white portion of the top.  If the<br />crimson colored fabric had been treated before making the top, the top would not have hadthe crimson dye run all over the whitefabric ruining the<br />appearance of the top. Buyers should have been warned that the crimson fabric would run."
2.0,"This dress is well made, but in the picture looks like sweater material.  That is not what I received. It was almost as shiny as spandex and just as fitted.  That is not really a problem for me, but where the dress hit on me made me look like I was wearing a mermaid tail or something.  I'm 5' 6"", on the thin side but I have some curves. This dress did not look flattering.  It didn't accentuate problem areas, just stuck to the skin so much I looked like I only had bust and hips, with a tail flapping just above my ankles."
2.0,More floppy and felty and fat than expected. Ok for a little kid at Christmas
2.0,These are warm and comfortable but look more like slippers on than boots.
2.0,I only received one opalite plug and one of the lapis plugs came broken. They are also smaller than my other 2 gauge plugs. Apart from that they are a good deal.
2.0,"Like comically so. It is cheap--if you want something with a huge brim and don't mind looking kind of dumb, it is great."
2.0,Cheap feeling. But cute. Made of flimsy plastic.
2.0,The next day the pants had a huge hole in them.
2.0,was not what i was expecting change color turn black the next  3 days
2.0,They fit very loosely and have cheap plastic hinges and tent to fall off all the time. Other than that they are good sunglasses
2.0,It's a nice cover.
2.0,"I am known for having a large brain but a small head.  I wear spongebob eyeglasses.  This set of 3 glasses fit my head.<br />I measured 14 inches horizontally across the front.<br /><br />For usability, the frames are ugly but light-weight.  The lenses are easy to pop out, which is exactly what I needed.  In the upload, you will note that I popped out the left lens because I only need correction for the right eye.<br /><br />Lens correction: I chose -0.5 for distance vision.  It is such a tiny change that I am not sure having glasses is worth it.  My sunglasses with -0.5 work better, but I cannot pop out a lens, wear them inside, or even avoid headaches while driving.  I do see a minor improvement in text."
2.0,"Shirt is too long, the fit was correct size but didnt sit right.  It was uncomfortable, bunched up didnt flow, tight around the hips."
2.0,My wife says there uncomfortable
2.0,got this in grey and it's very disappointing
2.0,Poor quality poor seams too high waisted
2.0,do not closes well with my glasses in it
2.0,If you are a fullfigure woman this gown runs<br />small
2.0,"I really wanted to love these. I ordered a medium, my normal size, and they were just way too big. Sending them back. The color is awesome tho."
2.0,"It’s well made, but very small."
2.0,"To be fair, I am double lining nylon straps which broke one of the buckle. but then I noticed another also broke on a normal strap.<br /><br />Easy way to unnecessarily cut yourself."
2.0,I sprayed bug spray on while fishing and it ruined the front of the face to where it’s faded out like an old watch would be
2.0,"Cheap, thin material."
2.0,Zipper sticks.
2.0,Had them for a few months now & they are tearing. They are cute but not durable. My Rehband's are 3 yrs old & held together much better.
2.0,Fit is very small had to return.
2.0,They were not as comfortable as I thought they would be. Thanks
2.0,These are not meant to be worn all day. If you occasionally need to put on steel toes for a small amount of time these will serve that purpose. They were comfortable when I tried them on but within a couple hours I had blisters. They will be donated.
2.0,fit when I got but I weted to take the wrinkles out did not put it in the drier and it got even smaller
2.0,"They're fun to pass around at shows, but they're heavy to wear on your head. You may get a headache if you want to wear them for extended periods of time. The first time I wore them they fell of my head due to it's weight and one of the lenses go a huge chip in the glass. They were still wearable.<br /><br />they're a fun conversation piece but practical to wear and can get annoying to hold."
2.0,Smaller than expected. It's very light weight but the edges are not hemmed and I'm afraid the material will split and run.
2.0,Poorly made. I had to unclasp the metal and cut the upper peice and rearrange the strands so it fit properly because it was all twisted up.
2.0,Is more like a very thin T-shirt than a dress.
2.0,"The ring is ok for the price, but the diamonds are chips. It looks good with my engagement ring. That's the only reason I'm not sending it back. I wish I would've shopped around more. The picture is definitely deceiving."
2.0,"I was looking for a packable down coat warm enough at 35-40 degrees (f) without a sweater. It was the right all-purpose length but not particularly well fitting for me. Marginally warm.  I am 5'2, 123 lb.  The medium was slightly too roomy across shoulders, too wide across chest, cut rather straight from armpits to waist level, and fit around hips. It didn't have much in the way of style as a consequence. But what made me return it was the zipper. While it worked eventually, it was not easy to start and I didn't want to have to fuss with it each time."
2.0,Great light but all three were the same character
2.0,I wore it once for a party. It's kid-sized. Quality is okay and not irritating to the skin.
2.0,Loved this dress but it shrank after the first wash and now I can’t wear it :/ I did follow the directions on the tag
2.0,"Purchased as I wanted pips of higher quality than what came with the uniform costume.  Unfortunately these are FAR too large.  They are at least twice the diameter of the screen compared dimensions.  However, they were good quality shine, just came in a baggy.  Just wouldn't work for the more accurate look that I was going for."
2.0,"very dissatisfied with the shirt. Fits ok, but it feels low quality, and it is so wrinkly .  I expected better for $24 bucks."
2.0,Pils quickly after 2 washes
2.0,Feel totally different from my other copper fit socks. So NOT easy on & off. Actually feel like a size smaller than what I bought. Can't recommend these at all.
2.0,The material is nice but the dress is super! long. I'm only 5'3 but it goes down to my ankles. Made for someone super tall! It can be fixable but annoying... I like the dress otherwise.
2.0,"Definitely size up two sizes. The large fits like a small, but the material is great. They are comfy and not see through. I’ll be returning for sure and getting a bigger size."
2.0,Couldn’t wear it to event.  Sis t cover stomach area.
2.0,Not good look at all. Very cheat looking.
2.0,"Fell apart after a few days while I was wearing it, the beads flew everywhere. The product did come with more string to use but tbh I’m too lazy and it cheap enough to where I don’t really care"
2.0,"I got a size L since other reviews were saying size up. I’m usually a M (or size 6-8) in tops but the large was too large at the chest and the straps at the shoulders were too long. I would stick with your normal size when ordering.<br /><br />Besides the fact that the large is too large for me, this top looks cheaply made and when worn it’s unflattering on me so I will be returning."
2.0,Dress is about 2 sizes too small!  I wear a 16 and ordered an xl and should have ordered a 2x or 4x....Went by many reviews and by chart. It is GORGEOUS though!!!! May consider ordering much bigger dress!
2.0,Fit is as expected but the sole came off after only couple of usage under water.  Definitely not worth buying.
2.0,"The earrings I received the felt on the back of the earrings was falling off, the beads were loose and eventually unraveled, fell apart before I even wore them once."
2.0,Top white part was sewn onto the base askew and the emblem on front was also off center. Returned it.
2.0,This is not a bad product it's true to size and has good quality..I'm 5'9 168lbs and they fit right above my mid thigh but as soon as I started walking the rolled all the way down below my knee..I pulled them up a few times but they kept rolling back down
2.0,"Huge and bulky, the colors are tacky in person. I don’t even bother wearing them. Honestly the best ones I’ve purchased have been from Charlotte Russe and are similarly priced - go to that type of shop for faux piercing sets"
2.0,"I live in Maine where you can be in a town or rural area in a very quick moment. I drive an hour on dark roads every other week to pick up my grandson. In the winter it's very dark as there are no street lights. As I e gotten older my eyes are more sensitive to beaming headlights coming towards me, especially in bad weather like rain or snow. This causes me to squint alot and over judge my location. After reading the discription I decided to try them. Less glare and less squinting? Not so much. As I drove tonight I tried them out. Still full glare just a yellow glare. The ""star"" effect from the headlights was just as big with the glasses as without. The weather was dry thank goodness. So I have chosen to return them. I hoped for something that truly takes the harsh glare of the oncoming headlights away. Squinting for an hour makes for a terrible headache."
2.0,"The look is great but the holes to slide your glasses into are way too small...my raybans wont fit in them and I am trying to stretch them out but its not working.  2 stars for the cool look, but I am currently not using it because they dont fit.  Yay"
2.0,"Purchased a large for a Christmas present, received a small. Returned, explained I received the wrong size.<br />Reordered a large... Again. Received a small... Again.<br />Seemed like a nice shirt. My son loved the color. I will have to find something similar for him somewhere else."
2.0,"The bell is cute, however the description says &#34;The bell has its own real clapper, ringing out a gentle chime this holiday season.&#34; It does NOT chime! Not a gentle chime... nothing....nada! If you're just buying it for the looks it's ok. If you (like me) want a bell that really has a gentle chime, this is not the one."
2.0,"This is actually a nice pair of hiking pants, and my daughter actually liked them quite a bit.  However, the description includes the word &#34;Waterproof&#34;, and that is a complete misrepresentation of what these are. They are not waterproof--AT ALL.  I had her put them on, sprayed some water from a spray bottle, and the water went right through them.  Wearing them in the rain or walking through wet grass would have soaked her completely.<br /><br />Buy these if you want some hiking pants for dry days, but if you actually want &#34;waterproof&#34;, buy something else."
2.0,I ordered an A and received a D. It's not worth the hassle of returning for so cheap. I'm sure it would have been great if I received the item I ordered. Will have to just order another set from a different seller & give this one to a friend. Waste of my time and money.
2.0,Didn’t fit my chickens. Straps didn’t stretch either
2.0,Refunded.  Too small
2.0,The material and color are not same as is showed in the picture
2.0,Several &#34;diamonds&#34; missing from necklace and on both earrings. Product was not as attractive in person as pictured. would not recommend this piece of jewelry.
2.0,"The overall though of this product is what sold me, but in the end they didn't work out. It gave my daughter blisters."
2.0,Shoes were scratched and scuffed.  Shoe strings are too short to properly tie a knot.  Thinking of returning.
2.0,Did not fit and could not get the sleeves to hang properly on my arms. They made me pay to return this item and I am an Amazon Prime member
2.0,Measure is not accurate!
2.0,It was pretty but the band broke right after I got it
2.0,Turned colors threw in trash
2.0,I think it must be a child's XL.  I gave it to a friend who wears children's sizes.
2.0,"Waste, don’t bother easily rips."
2.0,Loved how comfortable it was but the cigarette smoke smell was unbearable. Had to return it.
2.0,Soft and true to size but disappointed in the screen print. It’s almost like it didn’t take in spots and it did not appear that way in the photo. Would send back but for the price I’ll keep it to sleep in.
2.0,"Nice fit, but the material is not dry fit."
2.0,I'm worried the swivel isn't going to last. It feels like it will pull apart and I will loose my keys and be left with the clip on my belt loop. Time will tell but I don't think I want find out.
2.0,This is not a medium.
2.0,"I bought these to work out in but after a couple of wears, they suddenly ripped on the inner thigh. I was really excited for these and they were really flattering from behind but not squat proof and not to mention the cameltoe you get with these."
2.0,"This top fit well and looked great. Unfortunately it had a hole. Not in a seam, in the fabric itself. I really loved this top when I tried it on, but when I was about to wash it for the first time I saw the hole in the waist band material."
2.0,"I was excited about these pants because I had wanted a sauna-like effect so I could shave off some excess fat from my legs. First thought was how terrible the smell was. I decided to try them on anyway. It was unreal how difficult they were to get on. I don't even think I ever did get them on all the way. I bought the size I get in every pair of pants, leggings included, but the waistline is incredibly slim. They have no give whatsoever, therefore you have to slide this tiny waist over your hips, which is practically impossible. I think these types of pants would be best with a zipper closure for anyone with any sort of curves."
2.0,Broken earrings need I say more.
2.0,"Ordered a large and it was too small. Returned and ordered an xlarge,  which was also too small. I looked at the size chart before ordering and know what size I wear. Disappointed in the pants."
2.0,"I bought my first pair of these (in blue) a few years ago, and I loved them.  When I first opened them to put them on, I noticed that you put the earring in through the back of your ear (if you're using them on lobes, that is, as I was), and screw the front, decorative piece onto the bar.  I loved how comfortable and secure they were, but misplaced them in a drawer once, and missed them since.  With my niece's birthday  coming up, I thought of getting her a similar pair since I'd liked mine so well, and chose purple because she likes purple best and we'd bought her a necklace elsewhere that was a similar enough shade (at least via picture) that they'd pair well.  I also ordered another blue pair for myself at the same time to replace the lost ones.<br /><br />When these pairs arrived, I immediately opened and put in my new blue ones.  I noticed that on these, instead of the decorative front being the part that screwed into place like my previous pair ordered through the same link (exactly this one), the backs are the part that detaches and screws on.  This didn't matter; I figured they changed how they made them somewhere over the years and didn't think a thing of it.  However, very shortly before my niece's birthday, I decided that instead of presenting her earrings in the bag they came in, I was going to move them to a nice little decorative box with the necklace I wanted to pair with them.  When I unscrewed them to next fasten them into the box, I realized that on one earring, the front was the piece that unscrewed, and on the other, it was the back...it's a mismatched set! This carelessness in preparing them makes for a very tacky gift, and I cannot give something with such a glaring error to someone meaningful (or anyone, really; it's not nice to give people things with obvious problems, it sends a message that they're only worth a shoddy-quality gift in your mind, or that you don't care enough about them to give them something carefully selected and of reasonable quality).  So, I cannot give her the earrings as intended, and since I only noticed that they aren't alike when unscrewing them shortly before time to give them, I don't have time to get her different ones before her birthday; at least there's still the necklace. Unfortunately,  I tossed that outer packaging with the bar code and all into the recycle bin many days ago when these first arrived and looked okay through the inner packaging (with the parts screwed on with the carelessness not yet apparent as such), so now I can't return them.  Lesson learned: go so far as to even pull backs off earrings to inspect them that hard before giving them...and before throwing away packaging crucial to returning them.  Eyeing them with the backs in place and assuming they're proper isn't good enough.  Had they both been front-attaching (like my first blue pair was) or both back-attaching (like my second blue pair was), all would have been fine. but one of each?  C'mon, do better.  Care enough about your product and the people paying for it and lining your pockets to get it right.  I regret not keeping the packaging liner, because now I'm a bit stuck with them.  I might keep them for just me (wish I were more keen on the coler!), because once the pieces are screwed together, you can't tell the difference--so whatever--but as a gift for someone else, meant to be given in love and care, they're terrible.  You just can't earnestly give gifts like mismatched earrings.<br /><br />Also, of note: I selected those purple ones for my niece, which in the picture look like a pretty robust lavendar... a light purple, but still very distinctly purple. What arrived can only bry, very barely be called purple.  I mean, I think they are supposed to be the purple ones, and the packaging listed them as such, but calling them purple is kind of a stretch.  They're pretty close to that classic glinty-opal look, with a hair more color saturation.  Held up to the light for it to shine through, they almost look pinky-purple, and at a glance they're about as purple a fluorescent light: mostly whitish, with a faint tint.  I wouldn't call them anywhere remotely near the shade pictured, and that's accounting for the fact that different screens cast colors a little differently, and opal-y things also kind of have some variance.  This is more than typical varience or screen stuff:  these were represented as a much deeper shade than what arrived.  Since I had intended to gift them with a different item that is light purple to roughly match, it did kinda matter that what arrived wasn't in really even in the ballpark of similar.  When I ordered purple and saw a lavender picture, I expected something dark enough to at least be considered lavender, not this shade that is so little removed from white.  Of note, the blue ones I ordered were all quite similar to the picture, somewhere darker than sky blue, but lighter than royal blue.<br /><br />The blue pairs I've owned and own are quite comfortable and secure, and I love that my ears don't have a bad reaction to them (many earrings do bother), but I will not order any more because I can't risk buying something with such errors as this mismatched purple pair, especially not if I intend to give them to someone and have the manners to not wish to give them something with shoddy quality control.<br /><br />Pictured is the mismatched ""purple"" pair.  According to the way it looks on my phone, the color of the photo I took is pretty true to life."
2.0,"These are so hard to place in the shoe, that one broker while I was doing it. I'm going to end up using just the link chain because its a pain trying to get the charms in."
2.0,"Not worth it. Flimsy, cheap"
2.0,I normally wear a medium or large t-shirt but I decided to get this in XL just to be safe. The fabric doesn't stretch at all and I couldn't even get my arms in to put it over my head. So disappointing since it took forever to arrive and the return window was already over.
2.0,Beautiful bag just too small. Had to return
2.0,Different size which I had to wasted 10$ on it 🤦‍♂️
2.0,"I ordered a medium and was big, it looked like scrubs. I’m 5’6 and 143 lbs didn’t like it"
2.0,"Fits as expected is why I gave this a 2.  I ordered the burgundy... it was totally RED.... I got the blue instead.  It's a little darker than pictured, but I like it.  I don't recall on the red one. But the blue one doesn't have a tag inside to tell which is front and which is the back."
2.0,The rose gold is too pink to look like the real thing and the pin is too skinny to hold such large stone.
2.0,"I ordered this per their sizing, and it was too large on top and clung to my belly. I'm a D cup and I'm not especially larger on the bottom, so I was annoyed that it fit only halfway...which looks like a somewhat common complaint for this dress."
2.0,Sizes are off. I exchanged twice and couldn’t get the size right.
2.0,"I have very sensitive ear’s. I can wear 925 silver and 10k,14k,18k,24k gold.<br />They didn’t irritate my ears but they’re quit heavy. They’re also a little long; I like long but these r about an inch to long they get caught on everything example, Jackets, hugging, collars on tops, and hoods. Im a wife and mother of 3; my 2 youngest r 4 and 7. They’re always wanting held or giving  hugs.<br />I wore these earrings for 1 full day. The chains r just to long and quit heavy. For my life style I need something that I don’t notice. I had some hold chains that I’d worn for a month and couldn’t feel them slept and showered without removing. These chains did not irritate my ears as far as itching and burning. However they got caught on everything. My jacket/coat  every time I put it on or took it off it would tug the chain. A couple times one caught on my jacket as I was just driving. And everytime one of the kids or my husband would wrap their arms around for a hug the chain got caught between their arm and my shoulder.<br /> They’re very beautiful just not convenient for my lifestyle."
2.0,I got these so I could change my rings for the first time since I got my tongue pierced and when I put it in its wayyyy to long. Hangs about a half am inch off my tongue. Colors were cute. But only if the length was better.
2.0,so tiny!
2.0,Only have had for a few weeks and already the top does not stay closed. Holds hot drinks very well.
2.0,these are cheap looking and too small
2.0,"Jacket is good quality, but I was surprised by the size. I ordered a Woman's Medium, but was shocked at how size it was. It ended up fitting my 7 year old."
2.0,Does the job but the inserts for the watches are mixed sizes. Doesn’t fit well with various watches and is louder than expected. Switched to Wolf instead which is in a different range so I understand the difference.
2.0,I do really like it but Unfortunately it’s...
2.0,Received mine but it was tore
2.0,There was no engraving I love you on this ring like it was shown.
2.0,"Material is a little cheaper than expected. Runs extremely small. Possible Asian sizes. Ordered an xxl, seems more like a large."
2.0,"Runs small.  I usually wear a medium, but ordered a large to be on the safe side, but it was tighter than I wanted.  But if you like a very fitted style, this is for you. Unfortunately there is no size larger than large, so I just gave it away.  Gave it two stars for the color block design ."
2.0,This product was not what I expected. It was too large. Maybe if it fit smaller I would like it more
2.0,"Fits as expected if your inbetween sizes I’d choose the smaller size for sure (I wear medium and small fit perfect on me 5’9” 145 lbs)<br />BUT I got the pants and they had a hole right by my crotch and I haven’t even wore them yet. Honestly, for $25-$30 I thought the quality control would be much higher. I don’t want a hole in my crotch.<br />Honestly the pants are everything I wanted except for the hole in it. Had the hole not been there would have rated 5 stars.<br />NEW PANTS SHOULD NOT HAVE A RIP IN IT. PERIOD."
2.0,Not tight enough and leaks
2.0,"Honestly, it is very cheaply made and see through. The colors were not at all what I expected. I wouldnt waste your money. Go to Target and spend $15-20 on a sundress! At least you can see what you're getting!"
2.0,The masks were of very light. Thin material. Its like its going to melt after wash..
2.0,It lasted me for about 2 weeks then the elastic broke :(
2.0,"Love the style, the outer material is easy to remove animal hairs but I’ve only worn it twice but it already looks like I’ve had it for several This is what stopped me from ordering more."
2.0,They look very cheap...i will not be wearing these and it's to much of a hassle to return.
2.0,It was actually distracting.
2.0,"These shoes run smaller than real Crocs.  I ordered size 13 in real Crocs and they fit well with a little room.  I ordered 13 with this brand and they shipped size 13.5 and they were still much smaller.  Also, they make noise that my real Crocs do not make, it is like air is being pushed out every time I take a step.  They are lightweight and look great and I hope they stretch and become quieter in time.  Keep those points in mind if you are going to order a pair."
2.0,"I loved the pattern and material (Polyester) but, the fit is awkward. The straps are too short, which means the dress is too high under the arms and the pocket is almost at my boob. So, to make this wearable - I cut off the straps and wear as an around the house halter-style top.<br /><br />Caution: Do not recommend you put this in the dryer, it shrunk."
2.0,I did not find a material difference while using the glasses at night & during a rain storm.
2.0,At first I loved it! but then it started to crack and broke within a month of having it.
2.0,I returned this because the color isn't as pictured and I needed a specific color. It has more of a green undertone. The fabric is very thin and it's kind of cheaply made. It did fit well and look good on but there were lose strings everywhere. I'm sure the buttons would fall off soon.
2.0,I like the stretchy part but the buckle digs and rubs.
2.0,"Nice enough for the occasion I guess. They did not pay attention to simple details. The arm pieces are asymmetrical one was ok and the other arm was very tight. The head opening was very small for human head I had to tear it to let my head in. The trousers are tailored in very asymmetric way, super tight legs that didn't fit mine and super large pelvis which is again not proportional. Fabric material is not as it looks on picture. Shipping was not timely (as requested and paid for) to even try it before using it. At the end, it worked fine for one time use."
2.0,Hurt to wear longer than 10 minutes
2.0,These are TINY and flimsy. Be warned.
2.0,"The mask is okay. However, it is poorly designed. The mask has merely a sleeve on the inside the the filter slides into. The filter becomes useless because of the bad design. The filter just falls to the bottom of the sleeve and ends up covering the chin and top of the mouth but not the nose. Furthermore, the sleeve is open ended so when the mask is taken off, the filter easily falls out and ends up on the ground."
2.0,It is very pretty although small in the boobs. Had it fit better it would still be unacceptable because the lining is so sheer you might as well just walk around in your underpants... No real return option (beware of that!) if you keep all that in mind when ordering (you'll have to get another dress to go under it and if you have moderate boobs order a size up but then might have to take it in the waist and hips...) I guess you get what you pay for!
2.0,Didnt like and did not give an option to return would not buy again. Not flatering at all.  The material was cheap. Messaged about returning didnt get an answer
2.0,My dress arrived with a hole it. I of course didn't notice until I was out and about and my ass was exposed for all the land. I would return it but I will see it up. Sucks
2.0,"If you do some poking around, you will find better than this for 40.00.<br />Like me, you may have been attracted to the description... And I am not saying it is misleading. But it is described to sell at a certain price range and I do not feel the product is substantial enough for this price range. I found Wocci very good at 13 bucks."
2.0,Nice but not true to the size described on the website.
2.0,These were beautiful and easy to put in. I bought them for my 8 yr old though and one fell out. I thought that was the point of the screw on back. Was very disappointing that they didn’t stay secured.
2.0,"Like so many items, you get what you paid for. Doesn't fit well, cuff made of cheap metal that will prob. break soon."
2.0,"Have to return it - way too small.  The grand daughter loved it, but still too small.  Very disappointing."
2.0,"I was really excited for this sports bra but ended up unhappy. I am a 34DD so I got the large size as suggested in the description. The band was a bit loose but comfortable, but the straps were way too loose and there was no way to adjust them. The two stars are for the color and fabric quality. I was very disappointed and returned it."
2.0,Made of material that won't dry.
2.0,It does not look like the pic.  Only 2 layers super thin.  and too long.
2.0,It is super cute but not true to size and runs a lot shorter than shown in picture.  It is also a very thin material which most people don't like but i do.
2.0,These shoes I had to return. They were stiff/hard. And the size 8 was way too big for my 3 year old who is between size 7-1/2 & 8. As soon as i put them on her and asked her to stand she kicked them right off. I returned.
2.0,I bought these a little less than 2 mos ago for my daughter.  The material is heavy and like a bathing suit.  It is not holding up and has snags in it.  Will not purchase again.  Will stick to the Danskin brand that she has been wearing for the last 2 yrs.
2.0,Cute style. Broke in 1st 10 minutes of wearing.
2.0,"cheaply made, very thin. Does the job though, haven't taken it out when it's raining hard though."
2.0,Didn’t seem that it would absorb enough to make it a useful garment.
2.0,"Very cheap construction, looks cheap too..."
2.0,"This is a great way to stay out of the sun, keeping that in mind, it doesn't stay on your head. The slightest wind and it flys off. With any movement and the elastic band simply slips off. I would not recommend"
2.0,Pretty dress but even taking suggestions of ordering up didn't work.  I wanted to love this dress but it was even close to fitting.
2.0,"I really did like the band, but everytime I turn my wrist in a possible weird position it comes undone and my watch gets lost."
2.0,"Honestly.. I kinda laughed out loud when I opened these… not what I was expecting at all. I expected the pearls to be round, not all different shapes. I expected them to be the same length…. Not even close. I expected the pearls to be smaller. I expected them to be light…. Nope, super heavy. Not to mention I lost one of the backs because they weren’t on the earrings when I opened the bag, just laying down in there. Also, the backs are SO TIGHT on the post that I couldn’t get it off lol. I had to get my boyfriend to help me pry it off. Overall, I’m disappointed. They look like something you’d get off of wish for $1."
2.0,The dress was nice material but the sizing was off. The waist & hips fit but the arms & chest seemed 3 sizes smaller. I had to return it.
2.0,This might work for smaller breasts but the D cup isn't flattering or supportive for my girls. I wasn't really expecting it to be but another review said it worked well so I gave it a shot. Returning this.
2.0,"This one was pretty disappointing. Too big, baggy, and too long. And the material is sub par. I'm 5' and 115 lbs and ordered a small. Over all it is wearable but it's really not cute. It would maybe be better if it came in an XS but I'm not sure."
2.0,"Exterior leather is nice but the lining and inner pocket is made of thin, flimsy cheap fabric that will tear if you put a lot of items in it."
2.0,Didn’t really like
2.0,Sleeves are sooo tight! Fabric has zero give. Shirt fits arms don’t.... maybe I just super buff... no
2.0,I ordered two Greek flag masks.<br />Only one was actually a Greek flag mask.<br />The other is just the stripes from the flag.
2.0,One of the masks did not have the adjustable piece on the ear strap.  Also the ear straps are thin which makes me wonder how long it will last.  This product is definitely not worth the price.
2.0,Did not like colors in person or material. Returned.
2.0,"Purchased this for my girlfriend as she had an allergy/infection with the SS that piercing was made with. We went for titanium as it does not cause allergies, but as soon as she put it on a rash developed (look at picture, although she is wearing new silicone one after taking &#34;titanium&#34; one out). We went to a local profesional piercer who said it was an allergy, and after taking a look at the ring he insisted it's SS and not titanium. He recommended a silicone one (in picture) to see if allergy goes away."
2.0,"I was really excited to order it, but disappointed when I received it."
2.0,Ordered 2 sizes bigger and it is still small. Material feels like the lowest of quality of cotton.
2.0,"At first I was hoping it would somewhat resemble how it looked on the model. Nope. Then I was hoping it would look the same as the other example pics. Nope. The ""khaki"" is more of a pastel peach color than a khaki/beige color. It is also one length on the bottom instead of being longer in the front and back. I'm 5'5"" and 180 and I ordered the XL. I can say that I have a longer torso and arms and the length for both was sufficient."
2.0,"Usually I love this product. I've ordered it from MassageWarehouse and its been wonderful. This jar has been open for about 6 weeks when it began growing a pink mold film over the entire contents. Totally disgusting. The last jar I ordered on Amazon I got half way through when it began growing mold on the inside. Perhaps because this is a natural product, Amazon sells ones that are expiring, or sitting around too long? Needless to say, I will not be ordering this item from Amazon again. I will go back to MassageWarehouse, where I've never had a molding issue with this same product which I've been using for years."
2.0,The material and the cut of the dress is different than what's pictured
2.0,Bought my 2 year old daughter this outfit in in the 24 months size and it was WAY too small. Would have maybe fit a 12 month old infant. Upsetting because it was super cute and would have been a great play outfit for spring/summer.
2.0,"The image shows a longer section of material in the back of the cap in which ling hair can be collected and covered, however the caps did not have this material and were not as advertised"
2.0,Faded print on tie...very cheap material
2.0,Love the sleeves
2.0,"To small, not wide enough."
2.0,"great look... however, they arrived with a &#34;paint&#34; smell to them, which leads me to believe they are not Authentic.  They are really cute though!"
2.0,"The color was definitely more orange/brown than red.  I would have kept them, but one of the center beads was broken in two, so the beads were returned."
2.0,"Unfortunately, the closure doesn't stay closed."
2.0,el zapato derecho no le funcionan las luces
2.0,I'm changing my rating from 5stars to 2 bc it broke after 2mos of wearing it. While it is dainty and I loved It's too late to return it so that's money down the drain!
2.0,"Tight and now being donated.<br /><br />Update: Still awaiting the three remainder bras to be replaced with a better fit. Seller reached out after three months and expressed concern for my needs. They are very kind, but I will leave this review up unless all purchases are replaced with proper fitting items. The seller cares!! I will happily upgrade this review as promised once product has been replaced in its entirety."
2.0,The opening is too small for my ear lobes! I can’t use them! 👎🏾
2.0,Very sheer and poorly constructed to fit.
2.0,Do not keep your hands warm very small
2.0,"I was a little sad when I received this! It’s a beautiful color, However the band itself is not flexible and you cannot adjust it, if you have small wrists it won’t fit. Had to return it."
2.0,Top is cute but sizing is not clear in description.
2.0,Not the greatest fit
2.0,"Post were too big, only one pair is wearable. I did switch the post out for the rest of the ones that has big posts to regular earring hooks.<br /><br />But the material is light weight to wear. Looks nice on. The materials were decent with this price."
2.0,"This sweater is super cute and comfortable. I’ve only worn it once. I washed it before and after wearing, according to the label instructions, and the hem already started coming unstitched. I haven’t worn it again, because I don’t want it to get worse, so now it’s just hanging in my closet. So disappointed."
2.0,"Chain is very long.  Can hook up the clasp further down the chain, but then it tends to be a little crooked."
2.0,"Sleeves way too short but, the body part is big. It just seems odd."
2.0,"It broke the second i took it out of its wrapping, im not quite sure how to fix it, but if you buy it be very very carful."
2.0,I loved the look of this leotard. I ordered a large for my 8 yr old and what arrived was only large enough to fir my 30lb 3 yr old! It was sooo small!
2.0,"It's a cute shirt, however it is very thin fabric (which could be a good thing if you wanted that) and made poorly.  First time to wear it and both shoulder seam stitches broke."
2.0,Watch is cheap. Poor quality. Not worth the $18. Small watch face. Maybe better for a female hands
2.0,Sizing not correct for what is listed
2.0,These were much too small
2.0,Too oversized
2.0,"The color is very light grey, not a dark charcoal color as indicated in the photo.  I also normally wear a large hoodie and I ordered an XL and it just barely fits like a large.  If you want it big and cushy, order 2 sizes up.<br />Fabric is soft but lighter weight than your average name brand hoodie....more like Old Navy quality...not a super thick material."
2.0,"It feels like I am walking around with plastic bags on my feet  I don't know how to measure cotton in material, but these sure don't feel like the cotton socks i know and love.  I bought them because they are cute but my feet need to breath.  Also, not much room even though i bought Women's XL  I do have big feet though - 10"
2.0,Cute little bracelet but it broke within a day.
2.0,this came dirty and totally not worth the price
2.0,After just three weeks of use with a wheelchair in an office environment they started to wear to the point where they needed replaced.
2.0,Not sturdy at all
2.0,Bought these for my Dad. Fit perfect until washed. Shrunk after washing and legs were too narrow to wear again.
2.0,"They earrings are very pretty and look very nice. However, one post was shorter to the other and the earring-backing on the shorter one kept sliding off."
2.0,It was really small. Not true to size. The arms were snug and the shirt was really short. I'm 5'1 and the shirt hit me near my belly bottom.<br /><br />I do want to say that the material is really nice. I also liked that the pearls were not sewn on. They have a metal backing.
2.0,"I ordered this product and it was not delivered as stated.  I needed the shirt , so placed the order a second time.  I got both shirts in the same package, even though was told the first one had shipped.  Love the shirt, but now have two."
2.0,"I buy ALL of my clothes off of Amazon now. This was by far the most unflattering thing I have purchased so far. The material was very scratchy and felt (and looked) like I was wearing a potato sack.  The top was so baggy! The skirt portion of the dress would have been okay, but it laid so.... fluffy... I cant even describe how awful it was. I will say the color is true to size."
2.0,I loved these initially. They were perfect for making bracelets. My only complaint is that they turned very fast after wearing just a few times. Was hoping the gold color would last longer.
2.0,Nice gear. Decent price for online. But my belt came with a missing male buckle. Although the suspenders have some wear and ear they are good. Just threads hanging off which i can easily get rid of. The pouches are petty much perfect condition
2.0,Attractive bag but didn't feel like it would wear well. Description says made of leather but felt synthetic.
2.0,"Band didn’t fit, had to shave off little of band, made it fit, in other words, too wide for watch🤔"
2.0,I have purchased about 20 or more Patty Boutik tops and sweaters and always get XS if available and Small if XS is not offered and they always fit great.  For some reason I purchased the small in this size and it is so tight in the chest and arms.  I love the sweater but would suggest ordering a size up for sure!  It is a very fitted sweater to begin with.
2.0,"Belt is terrible. Button broke off these pants within a few weeks, wrinkled a lot after washing, had to be ironed and never really looked good."
2.0,"Comfortable, but not durable. One pair started coming apart at the top seam, and I baby my cycling clothes."
2.0,"Was really disappointed when I got this in the mail. The bag is quite a bit smaller than what the measurements online indicated (much like the review listed below, which was posted after I had already purchased the bag). Since I was hoping to use this as a bag for plane travel, I didn't think it would be much better than my current purse. I was also really bummed with the way the leather looked. I didn't love the color when I bought it, but I thought it would work, however, it is very shiny and made the whole thing look really cheap. I really wanted to love this bag, but I just didn't, so back to Amazon it went."
2.0,My daughter loves them because they are pink & glittery...I hate them because the clasp is so cheap it feels like it's going to break off every time I try to put them on her....
2.0,"These glasses are ok for around the house. I thought they were shiny but are a matte finish. I didn't like the way you could see the white trim when wearing the glasses. Overall for just knock around glasses they are fine but for fashion glasses,NO😪"
2.0,Product description says &#34;petite&#34; not miniature.  the watch is so small I can't read the dial.  It appears cheaply made.  A little disappointing.
2.0,A couple of the prongs were bent as was the main stand.  Not real sturdy so was easy to bend back into place.  Not and expensive item so should have known better.
2.0,"Ran large and I thought there was more glare then I have with a cheap pair of sunglasses. The quality is good, they are cute, I wish they were smaller"
2.0,"wasn't as cool as we hoped. The speakers wiggle around, he used it one week and after that it sits in a pile on the dresser"
2.0,"The cheetah print looks terrible, kind of an orangey color"
2.0,"A bit short for 5.7"" , 130 lb."
2.0,"As another reviewer pointed out, the latch doesn't stay closed.  Otherwise, nice product.  I glued on two pieces of Velcro for additional protection from things falling out.  Shouldn't have to do it."
2.0,"It is  thin and a litte large, would have been better if it looked like the picture. I need a return label so that i can return the item."
2.0,Delivered fast...broke super easily. :(
2.0,The color wasn't quite as described or like in the photo. The fit is looser than what you see in the photo as well.
2.0,"I love these and the colors and the look but they are tiny - order two sizes up from your normal size. Also, be prepared to replace the zip - it's a piece of crap - sewn in badly (already puckered and sticking) - and I know already it's going to go within the first few times wearing. Too bad. Also, tried to return and UPS did not pick up despite package sitting in hallway for a week probably due to COVID delays and now the return window is closed with zero redress. Sucks!"
2.0,Not true to size about 2 sizes smaller than size on label.  Ordered 2xl.  Fits like size 16.  Cute but it won't work for me
2.0,The support has already flattened on them. And they run large
2.0,I like the band but it is not easy to adjust.  I was hoping I could adjust the slide easily as the day goes on but you really need a little tool piece to do so.  The band pinches my skin at times.
2.0,"Looks good, size ok, but really barbed and uncomfortable."
2.0,Too over size
2.0,"Disappointed in the fabric (cheap) & the fit (way, way too small). I sent this boy back.<br />Two stars cause I dug the print."
2.0,"Product not as expected. I wanted 100% cotton. Close as you can get is 93%. Definitely were at least half polyester/nylon. Dont wick moisture away or absorb the sweet, keep feet too hot, and feet soar...."
2.0,I was really hoping this would work. The material is thin and is pretty see through. The material feels scratchy and the cut is terrible. It was crooked and the collar was flat on one side and stood up on the other. Feels cheap and had a lot of loose threads.
2.0,"The print is beautiful and just as pictured. Size runs extremely small. I ordered XXL received XL. If you are thick in the hips and buttocks like me, do not purchase! This skirt is made for petite small figured women. I'm s size 12 and the XL would not go up beyond my thigh. Not worth the hastle to return. Just won't purchase from this seller until I'm the perfect model size 2!"
2.0,"Esta letra se atora en toda mi ropa, sweaters, blouse anything so I don’t recommend it at all"
2.0,"Bought these pants to wear to Vegas. Although the pant itself was really cute I was highly disappointed that they did not fit. I am 5'7 120 lbs and ordered a small thinking it would fit great. By the pictures it looked like the pants were pretty stretchy and form fitting but this wasn't the case. Like I said the pants were super cute, they were even long enough which was my original worry when ordering...they were just wayyyy to baggy even for a small. I would have liked to have them taken in but now I don't have time :("
2.0,It was larger than I expected.
2.0,"I am 5'4"" and ordered a size L which is what I have always ordered from other brands, but these sweatpants were 31"" long and there was not an indication of how long they would be. Also, the fabric is much thinner than regular sweatpant fabric."
2.0,"Cute, but WAAAAY too small. The 3xl fit like a U.S. Size16."
2.0,Quality wasn’t great
2.0,Not same color as shown
2.0,I had to return the helmet because it was to tight on my head even though I followed the size chart accurately.
2.0,The product is just OK  .  I do not feel its much helpful for me at night. It does not minimizes the Glare from the opposite direction. Visibility is better than Naked eyes. I will not recommend this product.
2.0,Worked well at first but then it got stretched out after a month or so. Wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,Not bad for the price I can still use it but  only giving 2 stars because some of the feathers had fallen off inside the package and most of the feathers are split right in the middle of the eye. Also had glue strings but they were easily removed. Followed the advice of another reviewer and ironed the feathers with a rag and it helped the feathers.
2.0,"So being a busty, yet petite woman (size 4, 30H/30FF), bikini sets can be difficult. I do like the tops (size s) as it holds the girls in without fear they will spill out (yet to be tested in the ocean). The bottoms however do not fit comfortably. They hit too high, but too low to be a highwaist, more like midwaist that just cuts me in half and makes my already short stature shorter."
2.0,Only a few of them have pieces in the back that can actually go into croc holes I feel like that should be stated somewhere
2.0,"I used the tab on the back to pull the shoe on my foot fresh out of the box and it came off.  I didn't return them  because I didn't think I could.  Also, I was surprised at the lack of quality of the plastic. On a good note, they fit as expected."
2.0,Waste of money. Extremely snugged on my son. Strap broke.
2.0,Disliked because what I bought it for it did not keep my stuff dr on the boat
2.0,"I ordered a size up, fit was great shipping was fast. BUT I was sent totally different boots that I never would have bought. So overall I’m kinda pissed. I’m 7 months pregnant and live in Ohio and need boots I can wear to lessen my chance of slipping on ice and I do NOT want to wear these."
2.0,I love how they fit. They are very comfortable. I just wish they would be better made. I purchased these in 8/16 and it is now 2/17 and the seems are giving away. They are loose fitting so I don't understand why the seems are coming apart. Very disappointing.
2.0,"It's not cut right. The top part triangles are too long and not wide enough. The back keeps folding down as well. It's the right size, it's just sewed with a bad sewing pattern."
2.0,The metal does look too good.
2.0,"Arrived with a string hanging from a seam. It is NOT soft and flowy chiffon at all. It is rough and feels awful on your skin. It is basically the same material as a fabric bin for a cube shelf. The pink is NEON. As in, more neon pink that the neon on my Nikes."
2.0,"I was disappointed in this dress.  It looks like in the photo that the inside of the dress has the color of the outside but it’s not.  It is white inside , shows all the seams and it really makes it look cheap.  I know it’s more exp since for it to be lined but the dress is so comfortable and cute otherwise I solid have been willing to pay more for it to look better."
2.0,I got this to wear with leggings. I have a 40D bust and usuallg wear a 2x so I ordered a 2x. It fits like a large it is SO tight across my chest that it makes me books look massive. I'm trying to lose weight so I will keep it or else I would return it. Size up especially if you are not flat cheasted.
2.0,The hats a bit boxy looking and looks odd when worn. But if you are a Dr Who fan and don't care just want a Tardis hat who cares.
2.0,It was very uncomfortable and pinched my ear
2.0,Made cheaply and see thru
2.0,"The item desscription is incorrect. I just measured the backpack and its 15"". If I would have known it was 15"" I would have not bought this backpack. The seller should know how to measure an item correctly. They must have included the carrying handle as part of the measurement. If you go to any store for a 16"" backpack you will see a noticable size difference.  Note to the seller, please update your description"
2.0,I have tried all the 4 watchbands and they do not attach securely to my Charge 3 fitbit.  My fitbit has fallen off my wrist with each of the bands.
2.0,Looks cheap :-(
2.0,Do not by if you are at all a slim individual. Hoodie bunches up a massive amount in the front.
2.0,BEWARE!  This gaiter is cute & is designed with lovely fall/winter colors. UNFORTUNATELY it is definitely NOT designed for an adult. It is youth size. I am a small person & this gaiter is too small to pull over my head.
2.0,"I ordered my second one of these as the first one broke within 6 months.  Thinking I had a flawed band, I ordered a second one and it broke within 8 months.  I guess for the price, you get what you pay for!"
2.0,"Fell apart when taking out of package, but was able to return it"
2.0,They look okay in the picture listed but there WAY to small for my face its a really awkward size and doesn't look right. It also came bent in the middle but you can bend it back. The yellow one may be smaller than the other colors because in another persons review the picture they listed the size looks good but not for this yellow one...
2.0,"Too small , will not cover my nose and mouth at the same time ."
2.0,A LOT smaller than it looks. Not the best quality. Buyer beware!
2.0,"These are cute as can be, not too big and not too small. However, I haven't been able to wear them because the latch broke off as soon as I tried to unlatch it to put them on."
2.0,I thought they were real pearls
2.0,"The fushia stone was very pretty but when I took it out of the box to wear, I could clearly see what looked to be an elastic white thread between the 3 or four metal links.  Also, I wear a size 6 ring and the write up on the ring, said it would fit size 6 and upwards in size.  But, it hung so loose on my finger that it fell off my finger when I dropped my arms.  I knew I could never wear it.  I was very disappointed in the craftsmanship and poor fit of it.  It was too bad because I loved the shape, size and color of the stone."
2.0,The color came in darker than I expected.
2.0,"This was gigantic! I'm 5'2 and about 125lbs and I was swimming in a size small in this jumpsuit.<br />Very unflattering, do not recommend. The legs were also extremely long."
2.0,I bought these slippers in medium. They were too wide and too big. My feet goes through them and I slip and slide in them. I know they're slippers but I don't want to slip and fall.
2.0,"I liked it , obviously it was the reason why I did it.<br />The Quality it's different from what they tell you.<br />Sorry,  very sorry  !.😡"
2.0,"Update, I bought mid 2019 and this morning the minute hand just spins...<br />So would I buy again NOPE<br />Very disappointed..."
2.0,To tight could not wear them
2.0,The logo is painted on instead of being embossed. Looks like a fake product.
2.0,Fell apart within two weeks
2.0,"I wanted to like this jacket but unfortunately it just didn't work for me.  I purchased the navy blue in a size medium based on other reviews to size up (for reference I'm about 5'6, 125 pounds with the initial intent to wear this over my scrub top at work.  Unfortunately it was way too tight, even without it zipped you could see my sleeves all bunched up by my shoulders.  Surprisingly the arms were almost too long, yet the torso was too short.  I tried just wearing this over a plain fitted t-shirt but it was still too tight.  The only pocket was the small one on the back which was too small to put anything in other than maybe a chapstick but since its so tight you would be able to see it bulging out.  I did however like the material which was soft and stretchy."
2.0,"The buckle on top fell off within minutes of wearing the shoes. Super cute, but a bummer. Hoping super glue can remedy the issue."
2.0,Liked:<br />- matched skin tone<br /><br />Disliked:<br />- poor quality<br />- smaller than actual size (ran small)
2.0,"I had to get a replacement for this, the first one came torn. The second one was ok. I mean, it does it's job as a holder but it's not made well at all"
2.0,"Very cute design, but too big to my liking and VERY heavy for a purse. The two handles with metal add a lot of weight to the purse."
2.0,These pants were very cute but they did not fit. They were too tight in the hips. I even went off of the size chart. They were very cute and a great material they just did not fit.
2.0,"It is spacious and does have a nice lengthy shoulder strap which was what I needed. However, when I received mine the zippers were a nightmare! Two of them were so bad I couldn't even close the pockets with the zipper. I actually tore off the tip of my nail trying to get one of them to even close, so not very happy with it all."
2.0,I'm not sure why it's advertised as one size fits all when it's made for a giant!
2.0,Poor quality. I wore a pair today for the first time. I got through an 8 hour work day in the office before noticing the hole and multiple runs up the back side of the socks.
2.0,This pendant doesn't even look like real sterling silver or real turquoise. Im debating to even give it to my daughter whom loves vintage jewelry.
2.0,My gloves are a touch to small even thou I ordered a large which is my size. They are not warm enough when temperatures are below 30 degrees.
2.0,"I wore one time and stepped in water.  Washed as directed, now they are about 4” shorter and fit mid calf.  Pretty disappointing."
2.0,Obviously these are knock offs so I knew what I was getting. I have 2 pairs of real oakleys and just wanted a &#34;junker pair&#34; I could get roughed up. Expecting low quality glasses these are really cheap. They are super narrow around the head and sound like they are going to break each time I try to put them on. The lenses came scuffed. They do the job as my &#34;junk glasses&#34; but are cheaper looking and feeling then what I expected even with having low expectations.
2.0,"I liked the dress; however, the pocket seam opened up during its first wear."
2.0,See through. Fits big and it’s see through
2.0,"too small, slightly uncomfortable"
2.0,"Cute in the picture, but the reality is that is not really flattering, not wrinkle-free, doesn't stretch really, cheap material, very thin, no lining so it doesn't hold. I'm gonna take it to a seamstress I guess. I'll go to Kohls next time."
2.0,My wife loves it but do not expect it to come with anything but the chain and little wrench the other stuff does not come with it
2.0,Rough on inside and uncomfortable to wear.  Stick with kn95.
2.0,Size runs small and poor build quality. Its redeeming quality is that it is warm. But the stitching inside the pocket started unraveling in days.
2.0,"This costume is absolutely adorable, but SO small. Bought the size small for my 20 year old who always wears a small, 5’5 and 120 pounds. The elastic around the arms was strangling her tiny little twig arms…I can’t imagine who has smaller arms than her who this could possibly fit! Also, the entire thing was just super short. Not like I’m just old and think skirts should be long, I mean like not long enough to cover my 5’5’’ kid’s bum even if she is just standing still. We bought a black petticoat for her to wear underneath and give an extra 2 inches in length. It was super cute with the extra black ruffle hanging down, but I would have preferred for the dress to actually fit without buying an extra piece. Also, it’s not just the skirt that is too short, the waist is really high, like the entire dress is made for a kid and not an adult. The entire thing just looked way too small. It’s super cute, but order at least two sizes up. Also, don’t go by the size chart included in the post, according to those measurements my kid should have needed an XS, so I thought ordering the small was sizing up, but apparently she needed at least a medium, possibly a large."
2.0,The material as well as workmanship was of poor quality
2.0,"I did not feel that the quality of the fabric used in the body of this dress was very nice, also, it was rather see-thru. The bottom accent layer color did not match up very well with the body of the dress. It looked as if it was added on using leftover cloth from some other project. I like Mordernmiss products very much.  I will continue to order from the site, because I know that I will find many of their future products will be wonderful."
2.0,This item didn't look as nice as in pic
2.0,Not what I expected. Looks tacky..
2.0,they were pretty but had a mark on it like someone scraped some of the gold off one of them .
2.0,"Got the hoodie today, it a bit thin and the print is horrible quality, looks nothing like the picture advertised.  It looks like that time you think a background would work for your computer and is turns out all fuzzy.  The color is off as well, especially on the arms.  I dig the design and the main part isn't too terrible but i wouldn't reccomend buying this."
2.0,"The back is really cute but the front is boring, and the arms are an odd length, not 3/4 sleve and not long enough to be a full sleve. I was disappointed."
2.0,Way too big for the size indicated
2.0,"Runs small. Look kind of cheap. They don't have any structure so if you don't have a gigantic foot to fill up the shoe, the fabric looks really weird. Had to return"
2.0,Only one fit! The other was sewn shut!  Taking out the stitches caused it to rip. Returned.
2.0,"I bought these because they were inexpensive for a costume I’d only wear once, so I didn’t expect them to be great quality. However, the quality is so poor that I didn’t get to wear them at all. I put them in on my way out the door, and within a few seconds, they were both sliding out of my ears. I went to push the backs on further only to realize the backs on both earrings had fallen out and gotten lost in the time it took me to walk from my front door to my car. They get two stars for being as described and because if you have extra earring backs lying around, they are still usable, but I will be returning them."
2.0,Gloves do NOT look like the nice felted ones in the photo. They are cheaply made and do not seem very warm. I will probably return them. Disappointed that they are not as depicted on the website.
2.0,Fabric is too thin
2.0,This ring is really pretty but the sizes do not match. I wear a size 9 ring and this ring was way too big. I ended up giving it as a present.
2.0,Honestly not the best quality the straps are not sewn on very well and one of the straps actually snapped my first time wearing one of the bras
2.0,Very cute but chain is very thin. Not sure it will last.
2.0,Said it would fit youth … not true it’s huge even for an adult! But the material is soft.
2.0,The material is too thin.
2.0,Ordered these in 4t-5t for my daughter who wears 4t and they are easily three sizes too big. I have to roll the legs and the waist for them to fit her for her birthday party. Fast shipping and the pants are cute though.
2.0,"Im giving 2 stars because one of them came apart while my son had them on his coat.  The strap part came off somehow making him lose one of his gloves 😕 (Which I was more upset about.) the clip was still attached to the coat.  I didnt put them on until I was past the return date so I couldn’t even return/exchange them - that being said it was nice having the extra pair to replace it with once I got him new gloves. Double Checked the spare clips tugging on them and they’ve been going strong. Having a toddler cant guarantee they’re going to keep the gloves on, knowing that they’ll  just hang and stay on the coat is really nice, piece of mind."
2.0,"Very fragile. I barely put them on and it cracked. My head is not that big .. it stretch a little , but it shouldn’t have cracked. Very disappointed in this purchase. The lens was good , polarized . That’s about it. I wouldn’t recommend or purchase again."
2.0,The hat arrived all scrunched up in a small.. like really small box! It now has wrinkles and doesn't lay or look like the one in the photo.
2.0,"cropped means, really cropped"
2.0,I didn't really like these. The black portion on the top annoys me and I couldn't get over the glare while driving.
2.0,Color was not the same as picture
2.0,"I’ve see many smart watch bands before. But, this watch band is almost impossible to wear it unless someone helps you wearing it every time. This band was trying to be stylish. But, it is a big fail.. because, I can’t wear it by myself! Hopefully one day the seller changes the design."
2.0,"I really like the fit of these pants. They are comfortable and stretchy. However, after one wash the seams are splitting."
2.0,Way too short!  I bought this to wear to work and there is no way I can do that with the length!  Color is as pictured.
2.0,Not adjustable. So it's just a fashion thing advertising for Costa. Meh.
2.0,Buy if you wear size S.
2.0,"I bought a pair of Frogglez two years ago and they were MUCH larger.  They are truly the best goggles out there for kids, HOWEVER...this time around, I bought new ones for my kids (ages 3 and 5) and they are so much smaller?  My 3 year old can't even get them around her head and she's small?  Love them, but have to return and try to find some &#34;original&#34; Frogglez."
2.0,"The earrings were pretty, but the size was disappointing.  Very small  and uneventful looking on"
2.0,Definitely not for everyone
2.0,"Ive purchased Grip Six Belts and hoped the socks were of the same innovation.<br /><br />1. It is truly a thick, comfy and quality Sock<br />2. They run real small, quite tight, tough toe seam too<br /><br />I ordered XL which should cover a 12.5 size<br /><br />Well I wear a 10.5 --11.0 shoe, I could only ear these for one afternoon.<br /><br />vendor, processed an quick refund"
2.0,"Two flaws to this experience.  Shipping took far too long, over a month.  I expect longer ship times from the Orient, but this spend a couple of weeks right here in the USA because of the shipping method (FedEX &#34;SmartPost&#34;), and that made the delay just unacceptable<br /><br />Second, these are olive green, army green, olive drab, any of those, but not the green pictured.  I'm a green nut...that's pure green, peacock green, etc.  I'll keep them, but they aren't the green shown, not even close.<br /><br />Good fabric, good fit, comfortable, etc.,etc.<br /><br />Stay with a seller with US distribution, and watch for weird colors."
2.0,"The center that is between your toes is very thick, round and irritating making it hard to walk.  The style is good."
2.0,"I ordered this because I thought it was pretty and I like the whole idea of “no two are alike”.<br />It is very pretty, however it is quite a bit smaller than I anticipated so that’s disappointing.<br />Also, the chain is VERY flimsy. Mine broke as I was latching it for the very first time. I was still able to wear it but come on. 🤷‍♀️"
2.0,Shirts run small
2.0,Material is too thin and not form fitting. I was very disappointed. Does not look good on my body shape.
2.0,"Looks better in the picture, thin & flimsy material."
2.0,It is too flimsy. You breath in the cloth.
2.0,The painting is only on one side of the earrings and the stem is too short not to have backs included.
2.0,It is very small and not stretchy. Definitely not a 2x. more like an XL
2.0,I’m ample in the behind this fits as more if a sweater than a sweater dress. Great quality but I will be returning.
2.0,This ran smaller than expected. The material was also clingy so it showed very bump making it not very flattering. Returned.
2.0,"I got the socks for work, loved how they felt and made my legs comfortable. After 3 months starting to get holes in them. Tried to return them and there’s a two month window.  Disappointed!"
2.0,"Not liking this tank top!<br /> Firstly it has two thick seams that run vertical on the front & they stick out. I didn't notice this on the image.<br /> Secondly I ordered a Large & it's unflatteringly snug. Not to mention it's really short, bottom of tank stops at my belt.<br /> Unfortunately I had my packages shipped to mothers house & by time I got over there & tried everything on, it was too late to return this one. I was very bummed about that!"
2.0,"Sadly disappointed, got these and they look just solid white rather than stone like."
2.0,"It’s a nice, long warm coat but the zipper spoil the first time I worn it"
2.0,These shoe tore after one day of play at the beach.  Threading came out.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"Received these hoping to give them away/resell some to gain back what I spent. Over 10 pairs of the glasses had warped/defective lenses, though, giving a beer goggle effect. I expected a couple of duds, since they are so inexpensive, but not every other pair. I also had the first pair I carried around with me break in two days. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,Pockets on front stick out. Will probably sew them shut.
2.0,"This shirt may be considered ""oversized"" on a child, but not an adult. I was shocked to discover how small it was upon opening. I ordered the extra large thinking it would be baggy on me, it was so tight in the arms that it was extremely uncomfortable. I was pretty bummed because the shirt would have been really cute with leggings but it wouldn't even cover my butt."
2.0,The ring is OK.  It runs small.  Thought about returning it.
2.0,The watch stopped working. It's been two weeks now.<br />Second does not move at all.
2.0,"Top was awful, made for broad chests or far a art boobs"
2.0,"I ordered all four palettes from this company.  They’re pretty, easily fit into a purse, and are very convenient for color matching.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />1.  They’re grossly overpriced for what they are.  $10-15 each would be reasonable, but $30-40 is absurd, especially since they no longer include the nice velvet drawstring pouches to protect them.<br /><br />2.  The “seasons” aren’t clearly divided.  I counted 23 of the 48 total chips (or nearly half) in the autumn and spring palettes to be identical colors.  Also, some colors found in autumn are shared with summer and winter.<br /><br />My advice to the company would be to narrow down each season’s palette to only include the colors they think belong primarily to it.  Then simply write on the back of each color which, if any other seasons, it could also potentially work within.  This way the cost could be dramatically reduced, and comparison between the seasons would be much more meaningful.<br /><br />3.  Many of the color chips have flaws (see photos).  If each palette only cost $10-15, they wouldn’t be so noticeable.  But for a higher price, each chip had better be impeccable.  I exchanged many of the palettes I purchased because of this, and the replacements are better, at least."
2.0,It is very cute however the band seems to have tears in the fabric before I was able to even wear it once I was hoping to find a supplier for my watch bands because one cannot have enough styles but sadly not
2.0,"I liked the look and feel of the band. However, the pins popped out of the watch with and pressure applied at all. The band fell off and damaged my watch several times before changing to a new band that fixed the problem."
2.0,"The champagne dress is actually ""GOLD""...and the material is very cheap.  I actually felt I could have mad this my self.  I wasn't pleased but because of the price...I'm not going to complain.  I can dress it up with accessories...to give it a better look."
2.0,"Way too tight for me. 5'9"" and 170#.<br />When I tried to pull them further up my thigh the lace ripped and came loose but didn't damage the stockings because the lace is just an add on.  Fortunately I have a friend that has a smaller frame and could wear them."
2.0,Sweatshirt is very small
2.0,"Just so so masks. There are better ones out there, but they do cost  little more..."
2.0,This was the size I wanted for the weekend wedding I went to. The problems I had with it was the front clip did not always stay closed so there was a couple times were my things could have fallen out. The other problem I had was there was string and stitching coming out on bother sides of the purse also the zipper part was starting to come unstiched as well. It is a good price point for a purse I used for 2 days and most likely won't use again.
2.0,WAY smaller than description measurements say.
2.0,cheap cheap cheap.  I dont think these things can get more cheap.  Makes the gas station version look like Gucci.
2.0,It doesn't look like to picture at all.
2.0,Liked the color but I was under the impression the leggings were a little more high waisted and they were very low on me. Also the padding on the bra was creased and dented so it was very noticeable.
2.0,May have to return. Too small.
2.0,These were waaaay too big for my son and his friend.
2.0,Cute fabric but the leotard is not fitted so it doesn’t hug her body.
2.0,Wore it one time and seam came apart.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:36bb02d96ffff4227af56bbb744f1b86]] I wouldn’t buy these!!  The post is so short it took an hour to get it in the hole the post was too big for my gauge (that’s my fault I guess) the rim is so thick you can only see the Jewel if my face is turned and it’s not as pretty as the picture but it will do until I go to a tattoo shop to get some real ones because they suck
2.0,"I love the look of this dress but the first time I tried it on the zipper broke! The fit was perfect so it wasn’t like I was fighting to zip it up...the zipper is just really cheap and flimsy. I want to replace it but I’m a little concerned that it will happen again. For reference I’m 5’10” and 155 lbs, 36B bust and the medium fit perfectly. I also ordered a large just in case- especially if the dress was too short on me in the medium. The large was definitely way too big and the medium length actually went to just above my kneecaps. Broken zipper aside I would have kept it. So sad I have to return it! :("
2.0,Bought the correct size. Sm/med in lite compression.  I could barely pull them up.  When I did get them up they were soooo tight. Wore them for several hours and when I took them off my legs hurt so bad even ibuprofen didnt help. Giving the 2 pair to a friend who may have a better experience.
2.0,To tight on the neck.
2.0,Beautiful dress but sizing runs small. Normally wear a small but sized up to a medium and that was too small!
2.0,"I ordered this hat for Halloween I ordered large it came in small . the quality seemed good , returned it and reordered it  in large . It came in yesterday in small :(  If your kid needs a nice top hat this is the one ."
2.0,Had it on my key for 6 days with No one using it besides me and it broke from the connector ring
2.0,"My son is a very slim 7 yr old, I purchased the medium and he said it was too tight and hurt his stomach. I've returned the M and will order a large to see if that does better."
2.0,Box came with an obvious leak. Broken lotion.
2.0,"Came too small. I ordered the regular size and it fits and my 4 year old brother, not me. The quality is ok. All in all not very happy with it."
2.0,"This sports bra is not made for larger chests, I was hoping for a medium impact bra but I can barely do light workouts and I am not supported at all! I am a 36DDD, I thought the higher neck would help with added support but it doesn’t! Overall the bra fits fine, it’s a longer line which is nice, typically adds support but not in this case, around the arms is tight and pinches during certain movements. Save your money and look elsewhere!"
2.0,"I thought i could just slip it on, but you have to use both hands and put it on like a sock. It's VERY thin, you can feel anything you're stepping on, and it doesn't have much cushion."
2.0,"The bar length is too short, when I tried putting one of these earrings in my ear, the bar didn't even make it all the way through my tragus. I think that perhaps the set I received was defective or maybe I have a fat tragus. Either way, I can't like the earrings since I am not able to use them."
2.0,painful to put on and too large and awkward. almost falls out
2.0,This hat is made well I just wish it were bigger and covered more of the back side of my head.
2.0,Broke way too fast
2.0,This item was listed under cremation jewelry which is why I bought it. The pendent is pretty but there is no way you can put ashes in it. I would not have purchased it if I would have known this (deceiving)
2.0,"These are the thinnest toe socks I've worn.  I was afraid I'd pull them too much and tear them trying to get them to fit. They leave a very weird tip on each toe and no matter how hard I tried, I could not get them to come down and fit my toes completely. I have pretty basic size 9 feet and have never had this issue with toe socks before."
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  The fit is not wonderful, by any means.  The darts are positioned oddly.  Also, not a  big deal, but no earrings were included."
2.0,"Did I order wrong? These are clearly for a pumpkin sized man's head, now a woman. the arms are too long,,nose bridge things too wide and they won't stay up on my face. Until I go back and review my order and details of glasses,,,I'm once again without night time vision glasses."
2.0,Very cheap quality. Nothing even close to genuine leather.
2.0,Way too small.  I couldn't get them over my calves.  Too bad.  They look super cute in the picture.  I ordered their largest size (L).  I'm 5'3 and athletic build.  I guess they're made for teens?
2.0,"My hand stayed cold figure tips were very cold, I was really dissatisfied with the SVPRO Electric Rechargeable gloves"
2.0,"Again, it is just too heavy that it hurts my neck to wear. It is a beautiful color but not wearable for me."
2.0,"At first I liked the glasses, until i wore them and realized how flimsy they feel. Absolutely sending them back."
2.0,The bottoms were definitely too small for my 4 year old grand daughter.  But the top was a little big.  She wore it so we will keep it. She is average in size.
2.0,"These are still nice and cotton-y and no frills, which is why I like them. But they are much smaller than the  ones I've purchased in the past and the quality is not as good. It appears that they are trying to cut costs by using a smaller cut and cheaper materials. The waistbands on all pairs began unraveling after the 1st wash. So sad since these were my fav basic unders."
2.0,Not good glasses. I received a defective pair where the padding doesn't go all the way to the end causing a sharp piece of plastic to dig into my face. the glasses are big but the arms on the glasses are very short for glasses this big . the nose piece causes the glasses to ride too high on your face causing them to ride up into the bottom of your eyes
2.0,"I have bought this pair of sunglasses because of their shape, lenses diversity and good reviews. Probably it's just me and my experience with more expensive sunglasses, but the only good part of these ones is the case - hard, sturdy, well built. In terms of frame and lenses - cheap materials that I don't trust to much. When changing lenses, they aren't fitting perfectly in the frame, permitting small movements."
2.0,Almost all of the decals broke apart the first day I put them on my shoes
2.0,Wore for 4 daya after  receiving  and one ring broke in half and fell off my finger  qas a clear  break very  disappointing  i really liked the style
2.0,"I love the bracelet.  However, the metal rusted on my wrist!😥  That was not loved much."
2.0,Too big too long
2.0,"Love the dress, but mine ripped along a pulled thread the second time I wore it :( I'll be seeing about a refund."
2.0,Black Spots all over the skirt. My granddaughter can't wear it. Was not happy 😰
2.0,"The metal part that goes around your finger looks like it would be adjustable but when I tried, it would not budge. It does look like something from a gum ball machine. I can wear it on my pinky only."
2.0,"Really lightweight and easy to wear. The band is quite beautiful and stands out with the diamonds. The center stone isn’t very clear.. looks very foggy. I was going pretty disappointed to see the quality of the large stone. If the stone were clearer, this ring would be a 10+ star. This is a modern styled design, it’s very good easy to wear.. just the center stone on my ring was less than to be expected."
2.0,"Has an odd fit and the bottoms are a bit short. My largest complaint is that it has a rough, cheap feel. They aren't soft and cozy like you'd want jammies to be."
2.0,Straps wear out quickly and adjustment buckles do not hold well.  Clasps always slip of socks of all type.
2.0,Not Happy with the product.
2.0,"Loved it, but the seams fell apart after the first wash. I wear it for around the house now since I can't wear out."
2.0,they are too big for me even thou i got small but i love the feel
2.0,I love the style of these sunglasses they do the job to protect my eyes. They did have a large scratch on them when I received them. I tried to have them replaced but never got a response back from the seller. These were a little too big compared to past ones I have owned (not of the same brand). These glasses cover over my eyebrows and I'm used to ones being just under.
2.0,The wallet part is Ok but the money clip ruins it for me way to difficult to use and sticks on pocket going in and out. I will be looking for a different wallet.
2.0,"Zipper came undone at the bottom, as some are designed to do, but this one is not. You have to completely unzip and rezip to correct. I doubt it will last more than two trips. Only has two hand pockets. No inside or or outside chest pockets. No phone pocket or headphone channel. Ordered medium, but fits like a large. Not pleased."
2.0,"It's a nice-looking classic suit, but there are significant challenges with the sizing.  The first jacket was too small, and the seller generously sent me another jacket based on my coat size that I gave them. The one that arrived was too big.  Finally, I purchased another jacket of a size in between.  I finally have a complete suit that I like, but it was significantly more expensive than it should have been. And now I have three coats and two of them are useless to me."
2.0,"This dress has a horrible cut, super unflattering! It made me look very boxy. The pockets are really low. It may be made for super tall women only. I got the white one with red/pinkesh flowers, it was not see through in my opinion. The material was actually a lot thicker than expected."
2.0,These seemed great at first. Felt great and sturdy. But my bags didn’t last a month before the handles began to unstitch. I still use those but can’t trust the bag to hold heavy items such as gallons of milk.
2.0,I ordered a small. The waist has zero support slid done when I squatted. Too short. Again no support with this fabric. Pretty design but had to return.
2.0,I wear 8-81/2 but I ordered a 9...way too narrow and my feet were hanging off the back...
2.0,NOT FOR COPPER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!! Do not use on copper unless you want it a pale white look to it. This product says for copper but I'm telling you it will ruin it!!!
2.0,Sure these are cool but they don't last very long. I bought these and it only lasted 3 months before the print fell off. It appeared that it's pretty much a sticker.
2.0,"I read the other reviews that it ran small<br />So I ordered a size up. It was still way too small. Also, the material is a silk and not cotton like I expected. Not a good cheaper alternative"
2.0,"I loved it, but it broke the day after I got it. It shouldn't even cost a dollar, in my opinion."
2.0,Cheap material.<br />Waaay too small.<br />Not true to size chart at all.
2.0,"The earrings are great, but the necklace looks cheap"
2.0,Now very bright as shown in picture. Looks faded
2.0,A lot larger than I thought it'd be. When trying it on my child one of the buttons came off.
2.0,Okay but cheap looking
2.0,"The pants fit very well but the material is paperthin, and I really mean paperthin"
2.0,Not very soft. I expected 2XL to be better fitting.
2.0,Very flimsy thin fabric. I don’t see it holding up more than a couple of wearing.
2.0,Print is nice. Fabric feels waterproof and is undetermined.<br />Smaller cut than described in measurement chart.
2.0,The top itself is gorgeous but a 3x is basically a 1x. Way too small and clingy.
2.0,This beanie is made to fit a giant. The print is super cool but the cut of it just doesn't make sense. Haven't even worn it bc of it looking like a tube coming off your head lol
2.0,"I purchased this in a large and it fits more like a small-side medium. Cute design, but I can't wear it."
2.0,These are thicker and longer than they look...overpowering on a short person......have requested to return but am still waiting for instructions and label
2.0,very cheap material. both seams tore while I tried the shirt on
2.0,The elastic in the middle is uncomfortable and constricting the rest of outfit loose as expected... but material is VERY thin
2.0,The fringe makes it look like a cheap Halloween costume. It is not very figure fitting at all. Not crazy about it at all.
2.0,"These masks will most likely sit in my drawer and come out only if I run out of other masks. They are ill fitting and super tight behind the ears. Loose on the face, but tight behind the ears; not a good combination!"
2.0,Chain broke. Heavy.
2.0,I don't understand all the great reviews. Thin material and shapeless.  Looks cheap.
2.0,I wanted to love these! They fit well. The fabric is thin but it’s good for working out. The problem is the red dye had ran onto the yellow shirt. I was very disappointed so I had to return them!
2.0,"I ordered a Large since thats my size but its actually bigger than expected, but very good material. Im ordering a smaller size because I actually liked it"
2.0,"Love these but their sizing is way off, had to return"
2.0,"It looks just fine, but there are two pressure points jutting out just enough where the wings start.  These pressure points caused pain within an hour of putting the cuffs on.  I'll be handing this off to a friend, while hoping that maybe their ears won't be so sensitive."
2.0,Pants are thin cotton.  Top is more thick cotton.
2.0,"I bought a black / white one which I love. When I purchased this one, it fits nothing like it and I even went up a size and it still too small."
2.0,The buckle broke soon after I received.
2.0,"I haven't even worn the mask, which I purchased for the sole purpose of working out safely. Assembling the mask wasn't a problem. I tried it on a day or two after I put it together and noticed the nose piece was completely off of the mask. I guess a vented cotton material mask would probably be much sturdier than the mesh nylon."
2.0,"This is a cheap from China piece of crap.<br />Fabric bad polyester. V- neck not as pictured.  Sleeves huge. Length nite shirt long.<br />I'm 5""4 160. It's just horrible."
2.0,Zipper broke on jacket  had this for 2 months not happy it broke all ready
2.0,They are very long and run small
2.0,It’s a darling dress but the XS is still way too big!
2.0,"I waited over a month to receive these pajamas.  When I finally received them, one of the shirts was missing.  It was suppise to include four seasons and the green one was missing.  Bummer.  Hate to give an incomplete set as a gift."
2.0,"I’ve been looking for cycling shorts to replace some SheBeest shorts I bought about 13 years ago and are no longer available. I have LG shoes that I love…unfortunately, I don’t love the shorts. They’re not comfortable at all and don’t come close to the fit of my old SheBeest shorts that I’m STILL using. After 25 miles I was pulling on them to try to get them adjusted…that lasted 10 miles…I quit trying and ended my 50 miles that day with a frown.<br />Back to my search."
2.0,Beautiful dress but did not for right anywhere on me.  Bust too small and I'm not big busted at all!  The waist part was too big.  I used their measurement too.
2.0,The hat arrived crushed and shoved in the box in such a way that it changed the shape of it. It doesn’t really look like the picture either but for a kids dress up it’s alright.
2.0,"Felt like plastic, not leather. Very hard. I returned it."
2.0,"While the hat was definitely inexpensive, and it looked good when we took it out of the box and shaped it, it ripped before it could be worn once. The stitching is just not good quality. Remember, you get what you pay for."
2.0,I don't care for the lens shade. Unnatural.  It distorts what the wearer sees.
2.0, <br /> I thought it was the right for Oakley Valve (New)
2.0,Super cute but did not fit well for my hippy  silhouette.
2.0,"I appreciated the color is was true to the photo, however the rattan came two different colors and it was broken and it wasnt woven tight so it came undone, super unsatisfied"
2.0,"The title and image for this product is misleading. I thought I was getting a pack of ""Assorted Characters"" when I bought this as a gift for my friend. Instead he had to settle for one GoT character that was randomly selected. The seller should be selling these individually, not like this."
2.0,"Lovely robe...but deceiving. Material very very heavy.<br />Bought it cuz I have long arms and wanted long sleeves.<br />Washed it,discovered only attached in a few places,plaid fabric separates from inner blue fabric, end up with a billowy balloon of heavy fabric.<br />Washed it so can't return it.<br />You could &#34;quilt&#34; it to tack the two layers together, so big and heavy, it will take forever.<br />You could pay to have someone w a sewing machine &#34;Quilt it&#34; to make it one piece, expensive.<br />It ended up being a loss of money, bummer, shame, lovely robe."
2.0,It quit working within the first 2 months and a jeweler said we would be better off getting a new watch.
2.0,"Liked the bifocal reading glasses. Did not have to push glasses to end of my nose to see the world around me. Very good idea. That being said, after a few months the nut holding the left “arm” unscrewed and was lost making them useless. So, something to be aware of and preventative maintenance. Maybe the application of some loctite at the factory before shipping. Price point requires it."
2.0,"The wear on these is EXTREMELY small, not a good fit for me at all, but if you like a small wear they would be good for you. They are light weight. A couple of them came cracked. Overall was not worth it."
2.0,I love the coat but the buttons were popping off.
2.0,I love the material. Feels great on but when I workout they slip down from the waist.
2.0,Not flattering for me but cute pattern and soft fabric. It hugs my “fupa”
2.0,"This looks and feels like something a woman would wear, waay too thin and for someone who’s in shape it’s great cause it will highlight all your gains but if you are like me it’s also going to highlight all your flaws! Beer belly and man boobs all over the place. Not for me need to have a bit more weight and not feel so much like plastic"
2.0,"I'm 5'3"", too long ! Runs big !"
2.0,"I purchased this for my 13-year old grand-daughter. It is a sweet little necklace, and I knew she'd like it.  I intended to give it to her in a small travel jewelry case I purchased, so I threw out all other wrapping materials.  Then I discovered the necklace is emitting a terrible musty odor.  I tried using a baking soda paste on it, wiped it with vinegar, put it on a sunny porch.  It still reeks.  Too bad...I cannot gift this necklace in this condition, and will just have to eat the price I paid. This is the second time I have received musty smelling goods from Amazon.  Guess I need to go out to stores to do my shopping."
2.0,The bag looks nice but it took two attempts of zipping up one side pocket for the zipper to fail. Unfortunately I could not place all items needed in one place.
2.0,"UPDATE:  The socks are very comfortable. After two wears and washes they have shrunk and become scratchy. There are way better brands out there, please see attached photos, for 20 Dollars Way better socks elsewhere avoid these socks at all costs. If you like comfort and warmth, try fox river or smart wool."
2.0,My kids loved these shoes until my son left his outside one afternoon. It was as if they shrunk and melted. He can no longer get his foot inside. He only had them about a week...
2.0,Not up to par
2.0,The outfit is cute but poorly stitched.  It hasnt been worn but I washed it 1x and the threading is already coming apart at the exit of the top where the strings come out.
2.0,Warning! The color is darker than what is shown in the image on Amazon.
2.0,The lens on these glasses is not &#34;small&#34; in the slightest. They are like bug eyes - and the glass is more light brown then dark. I can't get out the idiot description of them
2.0,"Had to get different insoles for them, and the inside heel is worn off"
2.0,"The wallet I received was a thick plastic.  The wallet had a pattern, but had no suede.  I returned it."
2.0,The package clearly states Adult Masks...these do not fit my child.
2.0,"Runs too small, one shoe light doesnt work"
2.0,"Adorable, but 1/2 to 1 size too small."
2.0,The chain separated from the token in two days. Enough said
2.0,"Cute outfit for the price, but I also received a wild one shirt(still adorable and something I would purchase) instead of the hey girl shirt. The bottoms were also pants instead of shorts. Still cute, but disappointed it wasn't the hey girl shirt that I purchased."
2.0,I will be returning this suit.  It is VERY LONG and doesn't have coordinating cup size.
2.0,Makes feet really stink
2.0,I ended up returning the shoe because it was too small. If you're a size 11/12 I wouldn't recommend getting this. It may work better if you're closer to a 10/11
2.0,"Not for me. I'm plus size 5'4, 200 lbs and usually between size XL-2XL. I ordered a 2XL and the fit was just weird all over. The arms and shoulder were too tight. From waist down, it was a potato sack. SOOO big. The belt helped with form, but still did not look right, not flattering at all.<br /><br />Maybe on a smaller person it would work better, but I would not recommend for plus size. I will say, the material felt nice. It was much thicker than expected."
2.0,Super small unless you're a 0 - 1
2.0,cute but no stretch order 2 sizes up
2.0,It's ok But very thin material. Disappointed.
2.0,"I was very disappointed with this item. The clock face is smaller then a dime and the ""glass"" covering is hazy. This makes it impossible to see any details of the click face."
2.0,"The sleeves are not nearly as long in reality as they appear in the photo, which changes the whole look of the dress."
2.0,I love the style of this necklace. Color changed quickly. Now looks brassy
2.0,Not quite like the picture and looks more like a briefcase than anything but  not worth the time to send it back.
2.0,"The toes are shaped weird and are way too small to be comfortable. They bunched in between my toes and it was awful. :( I'm going ti keep them since I bought them, but I may cut off the toes or something."
2.0,"Frames are OK, magnifying power is OK, but they really don't block much computer glare.  I have an old pair of yellow clip-ons that do a better job.  Since I bought them to cut the glare from my laptop, that's a downer."
2.0,"Was way to short!  Had to return because it was too little and much, much too short."
2.0,"No me agrado, en la imagen de promoción se ve muy bien, cuando recibo me decepciono. Pero nada !! Que les vamos hacer"
2.0,"This cap looks OK, but a cold wind blows right thru it. Seems like wearing almost nothing at all. On your head, I mean."
2.0,NOT THE SAME AS THE PIC
2.0,They loo like plastic. Not at all like pictures. But what did I expect for the money?
2.0,They just weren’t worth price  And broken
2.0,It was a great band but brok after one year.  A pin holding the watch to the band fell off and was lost.
2.0,"Super cute, but runs very small"
2.0,Very pretty but not what I expected at all. First off disappointed it's not even red it's more of a orange red 😒 and they just kept falling apart I had to tighten everything. Not worth the money
2.0,"No actual arch support, despite the photos indicating support.  Right shoe upper is slightly larger (wider) than left shoe. The reasonable price attracted me but I would not recommend or purchase again. OK for running garbage outside etc. or around the house but not for much else."
2.0,Wore it twice and is already changing colors.
2.0,Shape was really awkward on my face. seemed to bulge out.
2.0,Came bent one earring back wouldn’t attach due to that.
2.0,Terrible material. Don't purchase. Scratchy
2.0,"Easy to adjust, but not comfortable to wear. It's very, very thin. Packaging was beautiful!"
2.0,"This dress is beautiful, but it's a no for me. The small was definitely not small. It fit like a medium-large and there is no extra small option which i'm not sure would even be small enough smh. The material is thin and transparent so you'll need something on under it. Also, the material sheds so it may need to be dry cleaned before wearing, I wouldn't recommend machine washing it. Any way if it fit better I would've definitely kept it...."
2.0,"it is a nice dress. it fit fine. my issue was related to the material.  it is not a natural material. it is synthetic. therefore, it is misleading to call it only a cotton-linen mix."
2.0,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. It started to deteriorate shortly after, and now it can’t be worn anymore"
2.0,Is too short to the waist and I ask for black come in dark grey
2.0,The belt was not one size fit all but it did come in handy my 14 year old daughter was able to wear it
2.0,"I read all of the reviews and decided to try this for an elopement dress. The style was as expected and was actually pretty nice, except for the fact that the white underlay was completely see through."
2.0,Style was nice but cut was very boxy. Sleeves are short in comparison to size. Returned this item because it just did not fit correctly.
2.0,Ordered brown but its a weird mustard gold cold and the fabric is rayon and nylon not what was described. Fit is boxy but okay.  Hate the dry clean.
2.0,"I ordered 5 of these for my 4 girls and for myself in Feb. No instructions, so went online. Didn't know the batteries were in it because of the 4 included. Followed the instructions for opening the device &#34;pull the strap gently&#34;.  Did just that and the strap ended up in my hand!  I also tried pulling the alarm keychain, loud but not as loud as I expected.  I accidentally set it off in the drugstore parking lot.  One or two people glanced over, but nothing.  Now THIS is something to be aware of!!! Today a package arrived in my mail containing 2 more Siren Songs.  I didn't order them!!  So I looked on my credit card bill, and there was a Siren Song charge for $39.95.  Needless to say, they're going back tomorrow, with a letter explaining why. Very sneaky!!!<br /><br />The keychain is where the alarm goes off, so if you accidentally pull the device, it goes off.  Thankfully, you can turn it off by putting the keychain stub back in."
2.0,"I really, really loved this bracelet and would have given it a five star rating but a pin that’s needed in one of the links to let the bracelet latch fell out and I can’t wear it anymore.  I’ve only had the bracelet about a month so it’s disappointing it’s now worthless.<br />It got two stars for being nice but lost three stars because it’s already broken."
2.0,This product will pull your ears forward!<br />Not meant for guys with average sides heads and lacks a nose wire allowing breath to escape to your sun/reading glasses.
2.0,"To start the belt at a distance looks fine but it’s not accurate at all. For one all the pieces seem to be just glued to their respective plates and there was a lot of scratches, chips and dents on mine it’s not great but if your just cosplaying or something it’s fine but not good as a display piece or as a replica."
2.0,Maybe an XL but certainly not a 2XL.
2.0,I'm 5'11 190lbs with a athletic build. The US large was way too long (in legs) and tight to be comfortable so I'm returning it. Color and quality seems okay though but you kind of got to be built like Kevin Durant..
2.0,"The movement of the hands is nice, and the face is easily readable. But the band is a bit small. Even putting the catch on the last hole left it a bit too tight on my wrist. Unlike most of the people who picked this, I don't really have many problems with the branding on the band. The red color is nice on the band, not too garish. I eventually installed the application on my phone, just to try it for this review. Practically, I was more in the market for a nice watch. The additional features would be more meaningful if I had wanted them; as is, I doubt that I will use most of them, even when I do wear this watch.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, I also won't wear this watch on a regular basis. The catch is flimsy and cheap, and I feel like it is only a matter of some time before it breaks. This factor alone detracts so much from the watch that I cannot abide it. Perhaps if I can find a larger, better band, I will wear this once more."
2.0,"These seem to be decent gloves, but they run ridiculously small.  I ordered a men's large and they fit me.  I'm a woman with average-sized hands - 7""  (measuring around the hand, across the palm) and my research shows that a men's large should be for 9"" hands."
2.0,I love the look and the soft feel BUT I haven't even worn it for 2 weeks and the green leather on one side has already unraveled.
2.0,"Cool glasses, but they are very small and tight. And I have a small-sized head. Not sure how people are comfortable in these. I'm returning."
2.0,"I am so disappointed, this piece does not remotely match the photos here. I was expecting an elegant cluster necklace with light orange and aqua beading. Instead this is a cheap looking junk store chain with Christmas shade green and red beading. The only upside is it came in a very nice, expensive feeling gift box. Too bad the necklace is not on par with the packaging."
2.0,This thing is HUGE. I wanted a simple loop scarf to replace one I had lost. This thing is like a huge shawl. I would send it back but it is too much trouble.
2.0,"top flares out at underarms, seam goes up your rear, material is cheap and smelly"
2.0,Crystals fell out and discolored right away.
2.0,"I went based off the other reviews and ordered up.  I shouldn't have. The thing was HUGE.  I had to send it back.  If you want to wear this, I'd say order your normal size.  I don't know if it's a crap shoot or they changed things, but if you size up it's gonna swallow you.  I will say that it wasn't see-through when I tried it on, the material is really light and soft. The potential is there.  You just need to get the right size."
2.0,"These run extremely small. Even though I followed the size chart, I would say these are 2 sizes too small."
2.0,"I really *really* wanted to like this dress. It looked soft and it came in a beautiful missy green color. It looked so elegant on the model that I had to give it a try. However, sometimes you take a gamble when online shopping and this time I lost. The material is a little scratchy and it felt more like a costume piece for a high school theater wardrobe. Most importantly, I looked like a Victorian child bride. Do not make my mistake. I had to donate it and I just hope the next person who receives it has a different experience."
2.0,"These bras fit really weird. You choose your actual size and it’s too small or tight, you choose one size up and it’s still not guanrateed to fit properly. Didn’t really like them, don’t recommend."
2.0,These do not work very well. I do not recommend to anyone.
2.0,Blurry. Not sure if we will keep them
2.0,"The fit is perfect, the material is great. The look is poor. There is extra fabric on the seems, the three tassels on the front are offset, starting from center towards mid left breast. Do not recommend buying. I guess you get what you pay for....lol"
2.0,Not colorful like the picture and hard to discern as turtles. Very lightweight...would not have spent more than a dollar at a souvenir shop for them.
2.0,I Ask a black color and they sendme a differente one
2.0,Nice print...material was okay...but size very small
2.0,Didn't last but a couple days! Diamonds fell out.
2.0,"I have a small wrist (6-1/2 inches) and this is just too big.  Also, the magnetic closure is not set correctly and it continuously disengages."
2.0,"The LED light switch is hard to get too. Instead of a push button on/off switch in an ear or horn, one has to unzip a very unwieldy zipper, that gets the mane fuzz stuck in it when operated, to get to an oversized cheap switch. But the grand kid loved them and put them on over the elf shoes."
2.0,Broke easily and is too small for my ear
2.0,"Great reflection to the cause unfortunately, they do not last. If you wear them everyday they become discolored and becomes bridal and brake."
2.0,the handle on the extension is made for small hands.
2.0,I was satisfied with the necklace. I would of preferred a longer chain. The length of chain would of been a nice option. Along with a nicer box to present as a gift.
2.0,"The Texas is nice, but bigger than I expected (about 1"" across).  The chain is flimsy, doesn't match well with the charm as far as size/style, not long enough and is scratchy."
2.0,"well I'm kinda disappointed because these socks do what my pet peeve is for socks! they slip down, and I have to keep pulling them up! these socks suck! they get all bunched up in my shoes, I hate it! I wish I could get my money back but forget it now! will not be buying more of this brand!"
2.0,"Fabric much dressier than expected.  They are not made for curvy ladies like me.  I usually wear size 12/medium but ordered XL per other reviewers statements.  They fit kind of ok in the hip area, but I have a short rise, so the waistband hit right under my breasts.  No go for me. Sending back."
2.0,"The reviews said to order one size up because of the smaller fit.  We did that.  We measured, and it was still too small.  Clothing is going back to long and narrow and this vest was just that.  It was a very cute style but I do not know what size chart they are using."
2.0,These would be great if I didn't have to keep cutting strings from them they seem to be unraveling
2.0,I bought these in November and really liked them . They were quite expensive so I thought the quality would be good<br />They lasted four  months before they snapped beside the hinge<br />Of course the return window is 3 months<br />Very disappointing
2.0,I disliked the fact that the metal band tarnished in one day of wearing the ring.
2.0,The Cameo was off center and didn't fit the bracelet right. I wanted it for a wedding and couldn't wear it.
2.0,"Love this dress. I’m a 125 pounds 5”4’ perfect size for me. I purchased  it for a birthday party.<br />However, I was not able to wear it, because the zipper was broken when I took it out of the packaging.  I couldn’t return it for another, it was discounted.  Very disappointed!"
2.0,"Advertised as a swim cover up, but the material is not suitable for that. It is made of stretchy thin polyester type material and not anything that would absorb water, it also has like a sheen to it. Would recommend this only as lingerie."
2.0,"I didn't like the sleeveless blous as much as I was anticipating. The double ties in the front make it look weird, and there's an opening in the back that I didn't notice in the picture online that I dodn't like, as well. I am returning it. Hiwever, I do think it's cute how it flows out from the body. Just not for me."
2.0,The tank top is wide at the bottom and short in the torso. The logo print is cute but it still sits in my draw because of the awkward fit.
2.0,"Shows to be longer in photos, comes shirter"
2.0,"Orthofeet 572 is a shoe I have worn for years with great satisfaction. When ordering my last pair I was unable to select the proper width of shoe because that stopped offering in a XX-Wide, I was forced to order it in a X-wide. Secondly, when I received the shoe I found that they have removed the webbing between the leather straps allowing rocks to enter the shoe. Before they made their changes, I would have given it 5 stars. I have purchased my last pair."
2.0,"No tiene ajuste perfecto, los dientes no son parecidos a la imagen publicada, el pelo está hecho pedazos. Más que miedo, da risa la máscara"
2.0,Entirely too small and the white part is a bit see-through.
2.0,Looks nice - detail stitching is very good.  But elastic stretches out after a few hours requiring retightening.  Over time (just a few weeks) the elastic is getting much weaker.
2.0,"I like the look but it fell off my wrist twice on the first day. The clasp moves too much and comes apart. On day 3, a leather band came off. I put it away till summer. Maybe with short sleeves it won't be touching anything and may stay on."
2.0,Too small it fit like belly/crop top shirt.
2.0,Good quality and seems nice but only received one set. Product was a 2 pack of compression shirt and pant set.
2.0,This bra was well made but the small was way too small. Might size up but decided to return the one I purchased.
2.0,The shirt I received was nothing like the shirt in the picture.  This is a very pale pink/apricot and there is no variation in color like the picture.  There is no detailing with darker thread like the picture.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Started chipping & the whole bottom is tarnished
2.0,somewhat too thick
2.0,"Stiff, buttons don't work, smells bad. Collar is tight. Not a fan."
2.0,These socks are nice thin wool. However they did wear out rather fast.... Guess it depends on what you want them for... heals and toes.. gone. Not for everyday use.
2.0,"I thought this product would be amazing, but sadly I was wrong. For one thing these chockers were very large on my neck even when I chained it to the very last part. Definitely cheap quality. A lot of the accessories on the pieces broke after just one use of them. There are a couple of the chockers that are better, but I am still disappointed that most of these either didn't fit me because they were too big that very first time I put them on, or they just broke. What a shame because I bought from this company before and I loved the last chockers I've had."
2.0,"One of the light up parts on one of the shoes is already not lighting up anymore and she has only worn them a total of 10 times. Also, the tongue on the other shoe has pulled off. She is not a rough girl so these shoes have not been abused in any way shape or form. Sad too, cause we really liked the look of these shoes."
2.0,"It lasted two years, but the material tore in four places. Now I'm wasting time and money buying a new one. Go for a higher quality alternative. There are better options now."
2.0,This dress looked good in the picture BUT! The stitches are off. Everything is sewn and surged but not all stitching is tight the lay is very awkward and it lays just as awkward on the body. It has a slit on the side. Short sleeves. The material is stretchy. The size is off it is smaller so I would go up a size. Just Not A Very Attractive Dress in My Opinion!! I hope this has helped. Thank You
2.0,"Not as was advertised, the front screen is plastic and very bendy, the material doesnt seem well put together and the overall result seems cheap, obviusly not as the rendered picture on te add, the front plastic is opaque and doesnt let you see whats underneath like new messages or any other notification also not as advertised and i dont know if what just bad luck but my phone fell once after a week of using this and my screen cracked and needed replacement. If you are looking for a quality product on a resonable price this is definitely not it"
2.0,Shrunk a few sizes
2.0,I wish the foot loop part were fixed in place instead of adjustable. It slowly gets bigger over the day and can eventually just slip off the back of the foot. I like the plastic clips on this set way better than the metal ones found on most brands.
2.0,"So I love this band at first, but after a month or so of everyday wear I started getting a rash right where the metal clasp is. Then I went camping for 4 days and it got really bad.  My skin is pretty sensitive, and it took a while for a rash to show up, so it’s not super strong. These bands are great, and secure, but I can’t wear them. I hope they work for you!"
2.0,"Great look, color & style. They sadly had 2 different colored lenses. They hurt my eyes & so took them into an optician, they explained that one lens one eye was amber and the other gray."
2.0,Arrived when said. Pretty but of a very thin material. I don't think that it will last everyday use.
2.0,"If you wear Large, XL and or bigger. Do not waist your time. I ordered the biggest size in the purple to use for my daughter’s birthday party and does not cover anything. Barely can tie it. Great material, just crappy sizing. You have to be small build for the colored wraps."
2.0,The coloring has rubbed off so now it is not rose gold. I love the style of ear ring but the only problem is that within the first day I was wearing it the color came off.
2.0,Not very good quality and pretty sheer. Didn’t turn out to be as nice as I had hoped and the sleeves were very baggy on me. I got a medium (my normal size) and may have been able to do a small but I didn’t reorder because I was satisfied with the overall look. I returned it for a refund.
2.0,I got this for my Son.  He showed it to me last night and it is falling apart.
2.0,Kind of disappointed the color was not quite as true in person and it didn't hang on me... I have yet to actually wear it.
2.0,"I purchased several (5) tops from this brand at one time, and all but one is a total waste of money. Pulled them out of their packages and immediately washed according to instructions... cold on delicate cycle and hung to dry... the worst shrinkage I have ever seen!!! Not the fixable kind, either. The fabric was NOT preshrunk before cutting and stitching the pattern together, that’s for sure. TotL waste of money and very disappointing, since they looked cute out of the package. This one in particular shrunk up from the hemline so much that it looked like a crop top for a hippo! Ugh."
2.0,"Needs refinements, as it won't keep it's shape."
2.0,No sun protection. Husband got sun burn on his eyelids from wearing these.
2.0,"goodr's glasses are SUPER comfortable for running. I wear them doing 10k+ and they never bounce, slip, or otherwise distract me while running. I LOVE the style of the Runways. I want to love this product!<br /><br />All of this makes it all the more disappointing that they simply don't last, as the polarized layer on the lenses is super delicate. I bought my first pair (green Runways) and after a few months the polarized layer began disintegrating; I contacted goodr customer service and they sent me a replacement for free. However a few months after receiving the replacement, my replacement pair began experiencing the same disintegration problem. (Another customer posted pictures of their green Runways with the disintegration issue, and that is exactly what mine looked like.)<br /><br />goodr has excellent customer service, but it is also annoying to have to keep ordering replacement glasses. I am extremely light sensitive but enjoy running almost every day, so each time a pair of sunglasses fails and I have to wait for goodr's customer service to send a new pair, I am out of commission for about a week, which is extremely annoying. Probably better off going for another brand until goodr can resolve the disintegrating polarization layer issue. Hopefully they resolve soon because they have super fun colors, awesome designs, and great customer service, and as soon as this problem is resolved I will be a loyal goodr customer once again!"
2.0,Material is a good quality but it looks completely unfinished. The headband fit me and the feathered didn't even remotely cover the thick black lining underneath. I had to do alot of work to it to make it look nice for my daughter's pictures.
2.0,I ordered this dress for a professional event and the fabric was too sheer and it also did not fit as expected
2.0,Cutting and size was easy been wearing for a couple days already can see the hole stretching though doesn't seem like it will last to long.
2.0,"My husband was not a fan of this shirt. I was hoping the lightweight material would be cool, but it was super thin and he was afraid it would rip easily. We sent it back."
2.0,"Package of 4, none of them change color like a mood ring.  Very disappointing for the girls.  They are cute necklaces, nice clasp and proper size for 8 year olds...but the color change feature was what we bought them for and it just stays purple."
2.0,I am normally a S/M and after reading the reviews of it running small I ordered a Large. WOW is it small. Has to be youth sizing. A large is still too small for me and definitely can’t be put in the dryer or it won’t fit at all. Not happy with this
2.0,"Pretty bracelet but must be for a child, it's small, not for adults."
2.0,"It is soft and chunky but be warned, the picture is not accurate. I received an orange colored sweater dress. I’ll keep it though since it was shipped from China and it’s probably going to be a hassle returning it."
2.0,The diamond fell out. Also the backs are super long and poke into the side of my head when I sleep. I do like the screw backs but unfortunately the earring back is too large that it just falls off the post. Other than that I like the style and the heavier gauge prongs used compared to other studs I havs purchased from other companies.
2.0,"It is comfortable but leaky on rainy days!!!  I have two Olive shoes, one in brown and one is back.  I like the design and fits well.  But it should have done good job with wafer proof.  Not wearing on rainy days."
2.0,These ripped at the seam the first day my child used them. They look cute and fit well.
2.0,My feet are a U.S. size 10 and I ordered a size 12. My feet barely fit lengthwise and the width is way to narrow. Other than that they are nice.
2.0,"Don W.<br /><br />Had I known it was going to be that small I wouldn't have purchased it, luckily it was a gift for my wife & she loved it, that's the only reason I'm not returning it."
2.0,"Cheap, some chains sliced and broke easily."
2.0,Nice and comfy but definitely for wearing around the house. Not a thick ‘sweatpants’ material!
2.0,These are not great for the gym because any amount of sweat is really obvious because of the color
2.0,The post on the earring isnt long enough for even my cartilage piercing Seems to be an issue with all my cheapy studs from China. Studs are larger  in diameter you can feel pain as your hole streches(that's what she said!!) anywayso it summary:<br /><br />They are pretty awesome and cheap<br /><br />but<br /><br />They are pretty much unwearable due to  post being too short and too wide in diameter<br /><br />going to try putting a regular silicon backing on them since I can't return them.
2.0,"The choker fits me perfectly and is exactly what I expected, but the metal bit on the clasp irritated the s*** out of my skin. A rash formed ONLY ON THE PARTS where the metal parts touches the nape of my neck, and now I have two dark spots on my neck where the rash used to be. If you have sensitive skin like me, I would stay away from this choker. A cute but otherwise useless product."
2.0,"Bought this dress for my sister in navy blue for an upcoming wedding today. It fit her perfectly and was very slimming to her waist (she gained excess weight in her mid section) She's a size 16 and 5'6 -- the 2X size fit her perfectly and went to her knees. It was roomy and flowy and gorgeous on her, but the moment she put an iron to it, it burned the color off the dress and left a large silverish stain to it. The dress came in the mail extremely wrinkled and the threading was coming loose. The thread material, which mimics a lace, is very fragile; you can't wear a ring or have long finger nails while putting it on. You have to be very careful and if possible, have someone assist you so you don't put a large hole in the threading through the sleeve area. Beautiful dress, poor material."
2.0,"I liked the actual necklace, simple & elegant. I was quite disappointed with the gems. I bought this as a gift & she could not put more than 3 gems at a time or the necklace would get all twisted up."
2.0,Late reviewing but bought as a Christmas gift and band broke in 2 weeks. Loved the watch but disappointed in the band
2.0,Lightweight material. Not for warmth.
2.0,Sweater arrived stained. Also it did not have the tags attached.  The yellow also appeared different from the picture. It's more of a faded neon yellow.
2.0,Smaller than stated... Low quality build
2.0,Casual toddler clothes should not need to be dry cleaned. Wouldn't have ordered it if I'd known.  Otherwise a very cute dress.
2.0,"It's roomy, but the zip-on lid is a little too rigid, so when I try to leave it open, it continuously tries to close itself. A minor complaint, for sure."
2.0,I haven't even had it two months and parts of it  have come apart  I would like to return it
2.0,Poorly made. The ports don’t twist to open like they’re supposed to but twist and come off which shows they aren’t sealed into the mask and therefore not a complete seal around your face. Looks good tho
2.0,ordered xl fits like med-large
2.0,Beautiful but too tight.
2.0,The dress seems like it would have been very nice and comfortable but had to send it back due to size
2.0,"The scarf is actually a neon orange, a different different than the picture!"
2.0,"[[ASIN:B079ZWVK83 PattyBoutik Women Back Slit Pencil Skirt (Black X-Small)]] I'm 5'3 and 95lbs, this skirt was too loose around the waist by about a half inch. That isn't my biggest issue though. The side of the skirt is cut really wide, causing it to bunch up. I have a small waist and hips, so this skirt was not doing it for me. I would get it tailored, but the skirt already cost 40$ and for that price it should be perfect. I'll be returning soon."
2.0,"Much smaller than expected, and the ball screws on the end wouldn't unscrew so I couldn't even out them on."
2.0,I ordered several of these and they came off the same day i wore them. Theyre cheap and not worth the time nor the money. Dont waste your money
2.0,A little short but cute<br /> The top is weird with the two metal holes.
2.0,"I bought this eyewear frames Carrera to use with prescription lens, I noticed that this kind of material has a problem to keep over the nose, the problem is that this frame slip off the nose and become very annoying when you lower your head to look at something, it takes care that it has a non-slip surface so that it stays on the nose, which they sell on Amazon and some are of very poor quality, because the rubber nothing lasts."
2.0,Not what was expected low quality
2.0,I got 2 sizes bigger and I was still to small for me.. the hoodie itself looked great tho I ended up giving it away and they lived it
2.0,"These outfits are very cute, but they are very much on the small side. The European size written on the tag is about two sizes smaller than the American size I ordered. I ordered them for my almost 4-year-old but they actually properly fit my 2-year-olds."
2.0,Thought quality would be better. True to size though.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress and after some thread snipping, stain removing, and hem fixing I guess I at least will wear it now.<br /><br />The color of this dress is beautiful! The double layer crepe gauze makes for a breezy but not see though garment perfect for spring, summer and fall. The design is float and feminine.<br /><br />The sizing was exactly as expected. I have a smaller chest, so the bust darts are the only thing that didn’t quite hit where they should. For more of an average bust, this would be a perfect fit. I am 5’1” and 120lbs and ordered a small. The length is just below the knee.<br /><br />My major dislike is the quality control. First off, it arrived with a blackish colored stain on the back.  It was in a plastic bag inside of the shipping container, so this must have been on it before it was packaged. Also, this dress was so poorly constructed that some seams weren’t even caught with the thread. Other threads were not finished off and there were loose threads EVERYWHERE! Not acceptable. I was actually afraid to wash it to get the stain off because I thought it might just fall apart at the seams. It took two washings to get whatever that was on the back out.<br /><br />After much close inspection, some snipping of threads and re-sewing of hems on the flutter sleeves I now have a dress that is pretty and comfortable. I’m really hoping that I just got one that slipped through the quality control gaps and others that order are not also initially disappointed."
2.0,I got a size bigger than I wear and they were still really snug. After washing them they srunk up and were way to small.
2.0,The sleeves were a 3/4 length on me and I even sized up...very weird fit. Easy to return however!
2.0,"The sizing was way off, even according to the size chart. Also, not a typical ‘sweatshirt’ material."
2.0,This was the most costly option that I considered for my bridesmaids and it was the one I liked the least.  The &#34;stones&#34; are flat and it just looks cheap overall.  I wouldn't waste your time or money.
2.0,La blusa es muy linda pero la talla no es real queda como un Large de talla regular
2.0,They worked well for a while but then they began to rust. Big thumbs down. :(
2.0,"Very small, cheap look"
2.0,I was disappointed. These belts did not stretch enough to fit me. The silver one looks okay but the gold one has copper-colored leaves instead of brass or gold-tone. This makes it look really cheap!
2.0,I got the black and it was so paper thin.  It was more boxy than I would like for my fit. The style is cute but I would not recommend.
2.0,"Ordered for a 4th of July party, came that week, way too big and no time to reorder. Had to return."
2.0,Packaging was poor. Hat misshaped. Not sure if I'll even be able to wear it.
2.0,"I wanted a white cool pajama set.  What I did not want is something so see through.  Returned right away, I didn't even try on, I could see my hand through the fabric.  Material would have been good if not for that"
2.0,The tutu part is not layer like in the picture  and the patch of floral design in the front sewn on wrong which create this odd gap that doesn’t lay flat. If it wasn’t for the fact I didn’t let me niece try it on past the due date I would definitely return it. I gave 2 stars is basically I got what I pay for. Buyers beware
2.0,My daughter got this costume thinking she would like it but it didn't look good when actually put on and the inside of the costume was super scratchy and uncomfortable.  We ended up returning it as she was unable to wear it comfortably.
2.0,"I liked this purse just fine, but the strap began cracking in multiple places.  I want to return it, but it appears that I am too late.  I don't feel that I have had it long enough for the type of wear and tear that is occurring."
2.0,"Lights don't work, loose strings all over, very cheap material used to make it."
2.0,It wasn’t made very well. It fell apart the first time I wore it. Disappointed.
2.0,"The top of the dress is thinner than I thought once I unpacked the dress and we didn't get a bow or ribbon for the dress at all, the picture featured shows a champagne bow, which is why it was chosen for a flower girl dress for a wedding"
2.0,"Look really nice and they feel light. The sun reflects off my dash but the glasses just change the color of the reflection to amber, but it still blocks my vision. Cant see through the amber glare. I will just continue to look for these type of glasses that also remove glare"
2.0,For some reason the shirt is wayyy too small. It does not come down like on pic. Would honestly send back
2.0,"The vest fits well.  I would like it a little taller but I normally order tall sized items, so that is just me.  This is my second vest.  I returned the first because the elements did not seem to warm as nicely as other warming items I have tried out.  My replacement is maybe 20% better.  The heating areas are not placed as well as they should be and do not warm nearly as well as other brands.  I am still going to keep the product as it does serve the function, just not very well.  I don't suggest it to anyone else though."
2.0,Advertised as a burnt orange but arrived as a bright red :(
2.0,Left foot  sandal came apart from the stitching at the V end of the thing. Perhaps faulty neoprene ? not sure. other than that very comfy and and true to fit just disappointed with the perhaps defect.
2.0,The jacket was sewn poorly.  The snaps came off as soon as I went to I tried unsnap the snaps.  Poor quality.
2.0,Runs small. The colors and pattern are very cute. This skirt does not fit the way it looks on the model. The top part is tight and the pockets make it look like your hips are extra curvy. It reminds me of the way a mermaid or fit and flare dress would fit...the top part is tight and the bottom part is looser. I’m disappointed because I was really looking forward to this skirt.
2.0,The material looks cheap and worse like Walmart's hoodie
2.0,"The scarf and hat are N'Ice....only I didn't receive the mittens, so that's why the 2⭐ review."
2.0,"The sound can hardly be heard, on daylight savings the watch though atomic would not change times, the battery is next to impossible to replace I couldn’t change it so had to buy a new watch this was my second watch from five senses and sadly to say was disappointed both times"
2.0,These appear to be child size sunglasses. They’re really too small for adults unless the adult is very petite.
2.0,I received this item.  My forearms are not big at all.  The sleeve for the forearm is super tight
2.0,"It's ok for cold but not extreme cold, my finger tips still freezes"
2.0,"Too heavy, ok for fall winter."
2.0,Wore it twice before it completely snapped in half . It's very stylish looking but cheaply made . Turns color after first use .
2.0,This shirt fits really oddly. It’s almost as if they made it for someone who had a very flat chest because it had no shape to it. The smocked part in the back was sewn really weird and didn’t lay flat onto the back.
2.0,"I am usually a Large.  To be on the safe side, I ordered this in XL.  This was a cute top but is several sizes too small to be labeled XL.  It might fit a medium, but not a L or XL..  So of course I had to send it back."
2.0,The cut of the skirt was very tight.
2.0,"Love the fit, perfect and comfortable size.<br />I bought medium (I wear up to 36inch).<br />It is cotton material so it is really comfortable, and good stretch.<br />price is really low because it is 4 pack. Parts are coming out often. Lowered the rates"
2.0,it was flimsy and ran small<br /> I am returning
2.0,"This shirt has the potential to be cute but the fit is really weird. I ordered an XL, it was very boxy so I sent it back. I may could have played with it a little more with when i had my hair done, makeup on and cute jeans to make it look better but I was being lazy. It may work for others."
2.0,I have two upper cartilage piercings and these earrings were just the right size but I could never put them on try as I might and neither could my roommate!
2.0,"My daughter asked for this, we were shocked when we got it. It is ugly, large, gawdy and looks nothing like the picture. I was expecting a beautiful, clear, vivid stone, we got some chunky, murky, huge stone. Also the way it was put together is horrible. My 8 yr old can make better necklaces."
2.0,They came scratched and super stretched out. Luckily I was able to squeeze them to the right shape but I was nervous they would break.
2.0,Fabric was pretty thin and see through.
2.0,It’s cute from afar and my four year old nephew is tickled with it but upclose it’s very thin and not very good quality. Looks like denim and feels like cheese cloth
2.0,"Straps need reinforcement & improvement- ALWAYS BREAK OFF!!!! This is a really nice bag and it’s perfect size , BUT unfortunately the straps constantly tear , having a break at the seams. I loved it so much I bought it 2x & got it as a gift 1x -and every time it tears at the same spot - making the bank useless. This is only after a short time I’ve used,  so three strikes you’re out.<br />Please improve  the straps quality  to make them strong so  they don’t tear after a few uses."
2.0,Great design but the sizing is terrible.  Barely fits my 8 year old who had a small head.  Would probably work best on a child aged 5-6.
2.0,Wore these maybe 3 times and the LOCs logo that clips on the side of the sunglasses fell off/out of the side of the sunglasses. I feel embarrassed to wear these out now that they have an indention where the logo goes and it’s missing on one side.
2.0,"Got this for my daughter. Color is perfect, though the material is weird and doesn’t feel great on the skin, highly recommend wearing a long sleeve tee under it.really cheap feeling  it’s not LL BEAN quality material but it does look cute. WOULD not recommend buying it, it feels like a 2 wear item. This is the kinda throw away fashion that is filling our land fills, hold out and pay a little more for a shirt that will last you years, not weeks."
2.0,"The second time I wore them, the rose tone color started coming off.  Super cheap and a waste of money :("
2.0,Product showed up with irregularity on fabric
2.0,"This could be a really cute coat...if the belt fit.  I really liked the color.  I bought a size up like others advised.  While the coat fit just fine, the belt didn't.  It didn't even come close to getting around my waist.  The look of the coat just wasn't the same without the belt, so it's going back."
2.0,Not comfortable for long walks.
2.0,"No breaks the chain links easily , not recommended ."
2.0,"Beautiful for my daughter, but to short in length for me. I ordered xlg one size bigger, but it wad not long enough. My daughter wears a medium. She will have it altered-worth the keep"
2.0,My child is under the 10 percentile for her age so i ordered bigger for next year since theres only about 3 months left of this year  wears a 4 now so i ordered a 5/6 so they would more so fit for next year -awww not the case they will fit for the next 3 months  and tbats it -definetly run small
2.0,Esta bien me gusta pero laverda que las tallas no son buenas ni siquiera me quedo de los brazos ahi es un robo x que aunque pedi una talla mas y ni asi no era lo que esperaba
2.0,"It ran very small. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it was too tight, there is no stretch in the skirt."
2.0,"This is a really cool design and feel - unfortunately there is ZERO elastic at the bottom, as viewed in all the pictures."
2.0,it fell apart after a couple of weeks
2.0,Ripped after a couple uses. Super comfy though and fit everything I needed for work. Can’t wait for the replacement. Hopefully this one won’t rip
2.0,The color is not like the photo and the fit was smaller than expected.  The quality of the material was okay.  I returned it due to the fit.
2.0,"Fiance is a size 4, bust size 32, waist size 27. She ordered a small and it was WAY too small. This bathing suit is a complete hoax DO NOT buy. 0/10 would not recommend."
2.0,"The graphic is very shiny, and looks cheap.  The shirt isn't as soft and stretchy as I hoped.  I don't like stiff t-shirts.  I'm returning."
2.0,Chain is much thicker than it appears in the photos
2.0,I really like the design and style of the dress but the size was not accurate.
2.0,Not worth the money.  Poor quality and fit.  The left sandal is too small...more than you would expect.  Returning for credit.
2.0,Runs small and very thin have to wear black under cause color will show
2.0,"Not quality of a $79 shirt!, outsourcing seems to be the American way. A shirt made in India I’m sure because of the low cost of labor and materials. However I was quite disappointed in the quality. I have purchased shirts from Malaysia etc. for $25 or less and had the same or better quality and fit. Quite disappointed."
2.0,"This coat is cute and fits well. It does okay in the rain, but the hood is big and often covers my view and it isn't completely waterproof. In a light rain where you are only outside for a short amount of time it would be fine. I am a college student and while walking across campus while it was raining relatively hard the back and chest of my shirt under this jacket was soaked."
2.0,"Nice material, but sizes are not accurate."
2.0,"Leaves color during washes, which stained my other clothes:("
2.0,Cheap material and sown sewed very crooked
2.0,The fabric doesn’t breathe well
2.0,"I ordered size 5-6 to fit in a size 7 boot. But they're still way too large. Also the picture shows them as just folding over the top of the boots, which is what I wanted, but in reality they are knee-highs. Love the colour and feel, so I'll have to fix them."
2.0,Plastic is hard to see through. The hat is nice though.
2.0,"These glasses actually made me sigh with relief when I put them on and looked at the computer screen.  But, when I went out onto the front porch to sit for awhile (South facing, daytime in California), nothing changed.  The lenses remained clear and after an hour, there was no darkening at all.  I like everything else about these glasses and will continue to use them, just not for being out in the light."
2.0,"Pretty color, lightweight. I liked the idea of the back but it just didn’t work on me. It wouldn’t stay on my shoulders and just looked bad on me."
2.0,They broke with in a week of buying them. Beads everywhere.
2.0,"Bought it for my baby shower in a large & it was wayy too loose in the top & bottom. The color was not sheer, very pretty. Just wish I would've bought it in a smaller size. Material is nice & cotton, dresses like that need to be more formal fitting on your body. Stick to your size."
2.0,Stopped working days after reciving
2.0,The size of this is very large. I was looking for something slightly more delicate. I think it looks tacky. My helix piercing is also quite high and it doesn’t fit or look right with the curve of my ear.
2.0,Esta muy bonito pero se le mete el agua
2.0,"This shirt wrinkles a lot, the necklace is not the one pictured."
2.0,"Eh, looks better in the picture."
2.0,broke before I could even wear it
2.0,"They sag.  Have to wear them just for yardwork, etc.  Embarrassed to wear where people will see me in them."
2.0,"Okay helmet to own, but not my favorite.  But, good for the price."
2.0,"This item is very pretty BUT it is too small to even notice anyone wearing it. The picture in Amazon's site was very deceiving & made the jewelry look much, much bigger than it is. This necklace is so small, that if you dropped it on the floor, you would never find it. It's a shame, because if you looked at it (maybe with a magnifying glass???) you would see how pretty it is."
2.0,The bodice has boning which made the dress way too large in bust. I was planning on returning but the cost was over 200.00 for cheapest shipping back to China
2.0,European cut not American
2.0,I thought this tee was a print.  It's actually the shiny iron on letters.  Would not recommend.
2.0,It's made very thin and broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,"Its okay....I wanted square, but received a rectangle...."
2.0,I ordered up a size like it says in the description but it still runs small. I am usually a M/L and wanted it to fit more flowy so I got an XL. Still fits well but not what I was expecting.
2.0,"UPDATED REVIEW:  Watch died after being worn in the shower.  It is most definitely not waterproof.  It will now go in the recycling bin.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS WATCH if there is the possibility of getting it wet.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST:  So far so good.  I replaced the band with something less blingy.  I've showered with it and it hasn't died, but for now I'm going to keep it dry.  Let's see how long it lasts!"
2.0,Nice fabric and tailoring but was way too small
2.0,Weird length and fit. Cheap material
2.0,"I'm a cosplayer that owns over 100 wigs. I was shocked at how beautiful this wig was for the low price. I pulled it out of the package and it was gorgeous however as soon as I tried it on the wig started shedding. But not normal shedding, like huge chunks of hair fell off. I don't know if I got a bad one or if all of these wigs shed terribly like this. Such a shame.  I'm going to have to return this one as I didn't even get to wear it once and its already showing bald spots. My Black cat cosplay will have to wait..."
2.0,Suggest getting one size bigger than your shoe size
2.0,"I wouldn't buy these, if you intend on washing them. Ha. The pads of course bunch up and come out. Then after a few washes they tend to form lumps and fold, so it looks all lumpy. I will eventually end up taking them out. So now they won't have padding. If you want a good sports bra with padding, don't buy these, spend your money elsewhere. Overall they do support and fit good."
2.0,"Ordered a small, received an XL.  But it's pretty!  Gifted to a friend."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:59f426db3a46684af722aa24ce46fafa]] Stitching didn't line up and was coming loose right out the bag. Was going to slap some company logos on these but not anymore :(
2.0,"I was expecting this dress to fit TTS, so I ordered my normal medium. When the dress came in I thought they sent me an XS when I pulled it out of the package because it was so tiny. The fit is very awkward, with it being very tight around my thighs and then loosening past the first ruffle line. I do love the look of the skirt, I just think the sizing of the one I was sent is off. I may order again and just order a couple sizes up and see if that works."
2.0,Love the design but the hat itself is flimsy and low quality. The adjustable band in the back comes undone easily.
2.0,The neckline is strange. It is also quite tight in the bust. I wish I had the energy to return it.
2.0,Wallet was broke when I received it.  The Red pull tab for accessing credit cards was not attached to anything and pulled out of wallet.  Poor Quality
2.0,"Love the color but wish there were more beads on it. I don't have a big wrist but the beads cover less than 3/4 of the wrist. I'm kinda sad because I was going to get the white and red one next. It really couldn't cost more than a few pennies to put on another 4. Sellers do this all the time, the cut corners and hopes it'll be fine.<br /><br />Update.  When I buy beads like these I just leave them on all the time even when I shower. Slowly all those little dark cracks have washed off and the beads are a much lighter and no longer shiny.<br />The term &#34;Hand crafted&#34;  should say &#34;Hand made&#34; as they're painted ceramic and not real stones. I'm wearing 5 different similar bracelets right now and they all look great....except these.<br />So.... I don't love the color anymore. It's all washed off."
2.0,Item runs small order accordingly
2.0,It was super cute but unfortunately broke within a few days :/
2.0,Was not the same shirt that the model had on... still cute just not what I was expecting....
2.0,These pants are way smaller than normal sizing. I wear a 36 waist so I ordered a large. I could not even get them past my thighs.
2.0,"The neckline hits above my collar bone and feels almost like a turtleneck,  not what I was expecting in a summer, sleeveless dress.  Fabric feels like polyester and is not very soft, doesn't breath.  I THOUGHT this was an ""Amazon wardrobe try before you buy"" and that I wouldn't be charged until I decided if I like it or not, but that was not the case and I've already been charged.  Not sure if its worth the hassle to return it."
2.0,Some fell off within minutes. Also daughter complained that they hurt
2.0,Nice dress for the price except it was poorly made. The neckline was disproportionate to the rest of the dress.
2.0,"When selling a key to one's heart, it is just understood that the key will actually fit into the slot in the heart.<br /><br />This one does not. Poor craftsmanship."
2.0,Too short in crotch.
2.0,The material on the skirt is a shiny stretchy jersey. Kind of a cheesy fabric. I wasn’t expecting that. I have a similar dress from amazon that has a lighter weight flowy type material for the skirt and I guess that it what I was expecting.
2.0,"Chain latch was short, necklace fit was tight"
2.0,its pretty flimsy. daughter loves it but the picture is just hot glued on so its easy to fall off and the bracelet itself is really fragile plastic
2.0,It didn't work for me.
2.0,"SWEATER WAS HEAVEY,CHEAP, HARDLY PUT TOGETHER..  One. Seam. Not sewn together....Going in a give awaysack....Get what you pay for.....don't buy cheap clothe's on Amazon!"
2.0,"Tarnished easily. Very cheaply made and cheap looking, but I guess you get what you pay for! Thought I was getting a really great deal on 5 necklaces that were normally  $20 a piece. Turns out they're just junk."
2.0,"It’s very cute, but the tassels come off very easily. One came undone as I took it out of the bag. I needed it for a rainbow party, so I kept it. Then when I hand washed it, several more came off. I’m finding colored strings everywhere!"
2.0,"Way, way too small.  I ordered an XL and it is the same as a medium and the fabric is extremely thin.  Not happy at all, especially since I lost the receipt to return them."
2.0,Pattern is off. Reminds me of the fabric of a child’s dress. Would consider 4 stars if cotton.
2.0,"Beads are nice but in picture lion charm connector looks shiny black. In person, gray and dull. Search elsewhere."
2.0,"The hat colors and stretch are great. However,  they are very poor in quality. My 9 mo old daughter pulled every bow off with one tug. Any mom who knows kids will pull hats off -the 1 stich attaching the bow is so frail it comes right off. Waste of money."
2.0,I was super excited to receive this ennard hoodie for my daughter for Christmas. It is her favorite fnaf character. BUT...... I was very disappoint with the quality of the printing. The sweatshirt itself was what you would expect for gliden hoodie no problems there. The printing is where I an not impressed it is alot smaller and very very dull compared to the description picture and the placement was not centered very well to me to seems to be placed to close to the neck. I am considering sending it back and looking for a better replacement.
2.0,The heel of this boot just fell apart after wearing them very little. Was not happy at all.
2.0,Returned because they did not stay in place to look nice like climbers
2.0,"I received two of these tops yesterday. I was excited to receive them, however when I opened them, One, they were not heathered in appearance, but were a solid color, unlike how the pictures online depict it to be. Second, the material does not drape at all, it very thick and stiff. Lastly, the neckline is not the scoop/drapey style that the photo indicates. The green color is also much more of a bright pee green than the sage color it looks like online. All in all I'm disappointed. I would just return them, but the seller is charging me $5 to send them back. I'm going to reach out and see if they will waive that fee. I will keep you posted on any updates."
2.0,The style is adorable and fit is great but it is incredibly see-through. Returned the dress because I would only feel comfortable wearing it with pants.
2.0,I understand the shirt has some flaws around the seams. I get that. However the front of the shirt is super faded while the back is deeper in color. Not very happy.
2.0,too small and spencive.
2.0,"It looks cool. It's just that it's cheap. The zipper on the crotch will fail I have no doubts. The snaps are cheap plastic and if you don't use two hands to unsnap them the fabric will rip or tear. They get two stars for style. If the quality was better I'd easily bump it up to a four and seek out more products from this brand. For now, I'll take it. The price was decent enough to justify the fact that it will only last a short while. But, who knows... Maybe it will surprise me and I'll have to do a follow up."
2.0,Horrible fit.  I had high hopes...
2.0,Poor condition and damaged
2.0,Ordered a size up and it still didn’t fit
2.0,Cheap and small.
2.0,It keeps comming in snaped
2.0,WATCH FACE BROKE OFF IN A WEEK.  BAND IS FLIMSY.  BUT ITS PRETTY.  CHEAP THOUGH.
2.0,It wasn't really what I expected and one was broken when I opened the package. No stones to finish the project were included.
2.0,Super thin liners that soften once washed. They will not hold up to a moderate or heavy flow. May be good for spotting.
2.0,"True to size however they get dirty and worn down very easily and quickly. Would only be best for “in the  house” slippers only (at best). Unfortunately, because they were worn down and horribly dirty after 1 use I didn’t feel comfortable returning them."
2.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 130 lbs, F-Cup. I ordered a size Medium. They just don't make these camis like they used to do. The shelf bra part is too short so it shows lots of cleavage and the actual cami is so long it is like a gown. These are not for petite women with full busts. I sleep in shelf-bra camis but every once in a while find one that has a longer shelf bra inside so that I can actually wear it in public without looking like a pin-up. I was hoping these would be more on the conservative side, but I will stick to Target and Old Navy in the future."
2.0,Mala calidad para el precio la calidad debería ser 7 pero es un 2
2.0,It felt cheap and the size ran small. Save your money and just buy from the merch site or make it yourself.
2.0,Returned because they are so small. I wear a 9.5 and ordered a 10 and could barely get my foot in.
2.0,Not what I expected at all. Small small small
2.0,I had to sew the seams under the arms to keep my bra from showing.<br />I wouldn't purchase again because of the for.
2.0,"Fairly large even for a large, fabric color bleeds. It does not wear like the picture in my opinion. I maybe should have tried a medium."
2.0,"It took forever to get here. It looks very nice but, doesn't hold it's shape like other ones that I've purchased in the past."
2.0,Bad. Comfy but only had maybe six weeks and it's already falling apart
2.0,"I recently purchased this. It took a while to deliver as it comes from China. The color is like a winter white. When I took it out of the package pieces of the material was falling off (fuzz balls I guess). I washed it and put it through the dryer and that solved the issue. However, the collar looks like it was cut out with scissors and left that way. It you wash it repeatedly, I doubt it will hold up for long.  The pockets have an extra piece of material lapped over it. I'm not quit sure what to do with that. If you look at the photo it looks like a slit but it is not. It is just hanging material over the pockets...its odd. It is soft and plush. I wore it to work with a scarf and it was ok. I bought an XL and the fit was ok."
2.0,"This is a very beautiful septum hoop. I needed it for a special occasion, so was not planning on wearing it every day because of the metal it is made of. The price was right for most likely a one time wearing, since I don't do special occasions (weddings) very often LOL.  It appears that it would be the exact fit, but it will not close. It travels past the spot where it should click closed making no connection at all, to underneath it. So disappointed I was excited about finding exactly what I was looking for."
2.0,I thought these would be different from the shag carpeted slipper I bought before.  Guess I just need to stick with sandals.  It said 9.5 - 10 but it's definitely a 10.5.  Tried a pair of shoe inserts for sweaty feet and it doesn't help much.  Too bad I like the look of 'em.
2.0,Didn’t fit as well as some of the other sold colors. I was so impressed with the black and white shirts so i order this one as well. It definitely felt like a different material.
2.0,"Doesn't maintain tightness and sags after bending a few times<br />And yes, I always hang to dry.  Just doesn't seem to have much compression at all and what is does have, it doesn't maintain.<br />That said, they are true to size for ordering so if you just need a legging for fashion, then they would work."
2.0,Supposed to be for planters facitis not a bad shoe but doesn't work for the foot ailment feet hurt after an hour of wearing
2.0,"Very cute swimsuit and feels like it is well-made. Unfortunately, even after ordering up a size or two, the cups are still too small for my. I wear a US size 8, 34DD. The torso is also really short, and I'm only 5'2. This swimsuit is unfortunately going back."
2.0,"This is a cute leo, but the fit is off. It is really wide and super high cut on the hips, and baggy in the butt area. My daughter wore shorts over it."
2.0,The owl ear rings were bent when they arrived and were broken when tying to fix it the right direction. They can be repaired with the right equipment.
2.0,Ordered this for a friend expecting the ring pictured in the ad. Recieved this ring (no yellow/red). When I re-ordered-in a smaller size it was correct. (I kept the original for myself because it is cute... Seems to be well made)
2.0,they are too wide to close well
2.0,cute for a child.. and very cheaply made.. returned.
2.0,Bought a size bigger than normal for my daughter and it was still to small
2.0,"Nice fabric but way too big. As soon as I put them on, they dropped to the floor. Based on the measurements in the size chart I ordered 3X, though I normally wear an 18 or 1X-2X, probably could use an XL in these. There seems to be no hold in the waist band, so even if I order a smaller size, I don't see how they would stay on. I just need a comfy pair of lounge pants... I'm having the hardest luck finding what I need. I'll be returning these. 😕"
2.0,"Poor quality.  The ball on top fell off within a week of having the hat.  Not from any rigorous activity.  I was just sitting in a car and it fell off.  The hat itself just feels cheap, also."
2.0,"Even the ring is beautiful, ring size chart is not right. I bought one as gift following the size chart and size was huge. Also, because return/exchange is over due time I am not able to exchanged for smaller size. Very Disappointed!!!"
2.0,The material feels super cheap.  I usually don’t mind puffy sleeves but it was weird with this style of hoodie.  Returning.
2.0,"Jacket colour is not black, it is grey. Also it is expensive than the other sellers.<br />Sold By: Getz's Clothiers"
2.0,La tela es barata y mala. Pero el diseño me gusto mucho.
2.0,"I had high hopes for these shorts, but the white ones were so thin and extremely see through. You can see the pockets through the legs even"
2.0,"The pulse near the base is broken, and the tool sent to remove the pieces from the pulse broke after first use. I dont have problem with the base but with the pulse"
2.0,"These look like the shoe trees I used to use years ago but the metal prongs that are used to adjust their size are not as strong.  Every time I put them in my shoes, the prongs fall out of the holes--even when I try to be careful.  After several frustrating times of me having to put the prongs back into their holes and reinserting them into my shoes, I FINALLY succeed, only to have them fall out when I take them out of my shoes!  I do not recommend these shoe trees unless you need a cheap alternative to a good set."
2.0,What you see is not what what you get. I ordered these because it showed striped pairs. Wal-Mart is cheaper and you can go to a store and see what you get.
2.0,These are cute tops for casual wear but are horrible to workout in. Cardio impossible as they provide no real support.
2.0,Runs a bit small and fell apart after only a handful of swims and a couple of washes.
2.0,Very thin and narrow lanyards maybe only one half an inch wide at most. Don’t trust your valuable keys on one of these
2.0,"Overall the pants seemed like a great purchase, 1/4 of the price as the name brand version and the material and design was pretty similar. After trying them on they fit great at the waist, but not my legs. I am around 6ft 260lbs and wear a size 38 to 40 waist for all my regular clothing so I went with the 40×30 size and the waist was perfect but I have &#34;tree trunks&#34; for legs as my wife says and the pants were kinda snug on my thighs and calves. After a 12 hour fishing trip the zipper for the leg piece that comes off to turn them into shorts split when stepping over a log, zipper is broke now and not fixable so theyre now basically permanent shorts."
2.0,It was great until it broke 3 weeks later.
2.0,"I'm 5'2, ordered a medium, but this still runs tight. Especially, on the waist and the crotch area, non-stretchy and uncomfortable."
2.0,Nice and warm while they lasted.  Which was only about three months.
2.0,The bacon cheeseburger costume is very vibrant in color. The quality is not the best. One use and the image is already peeling away from the backing. Others have indicated that fit is a bit of an issue and I would agree. A few more fasteners along the edges would be helpful. Somehow making this costume 3D instead of a front and back panel would be awesome.
2.0,Looks cheap. Not really what I expected it to do.
2.0,"Don;t make a mistake and forget to take it go in tn the shower. You can't wear it all day long ,the sweat will rust it"
2.0,"I used the size chart when ordering but this dress was too small. Also, the color navy was so dark it looked black and the top half was a different shade than the skirt. The vendor was courteous, shipping was fast, and returning it was easy...thank you for that part....just the product wasn't up to par."
2.0,Very cute. Too much material and very heavy
2.0,"Be sure to purchase at least three sizes larger than you normally would ,  material is not typical sweatshirt material it is more of a silky blend of rayon"
2.0,Not as expected it got teared after 5th time wearing it
2.0,The material is pretty patter but it snags easily and has strings hanging
2.0,"Looks cheap.  I had to return, although the price was fair.  The quality wasn't there."
2.0,"The picture of the dress looks better online than receiving it. The back of the dress has very high split which goes all the up to my bum. I am about 6&#34;1 and it looks as though I may need to get it altered and I don't feel at this price it was worth the price. It was a little itchy on the shoulders, I needed this dress for a wedding in a few weeks. I ended up returning the dress."
2.0,The clear part you can not see out of it it’s cloudy
2.0,"Very cute, but breaks really easily!! Be gentle with this, I only shook it a little too hard and the pearl + chain fell off instantly."
2.0,"The two stars is only for the design of the jumpsuit- it's light and comfortable for hot summer weather and the back tie is really cute. Unfortunately, I could not zip the back all the way up because there is no stretch in the material whatsoever. I wanted to love this jumpsuit because I usually love all jumpsuits but this is not curly women friendly."
2.0,"These are great, if you only want to wear each pair once. Pretty poor quality as each pair, after ONE wearing has holes in it..."
2.0,Arms were very short after washing it and i did not put it in the dryer!
2.0,"I was really looking forward to buying this dress, since the picture looked cute. However, the dress was cheaply made and didn't fit over my chest (36G). The straps on the top of the dress are extremely thin. I normally wear a medium in dresses and even ordered a size up since this dress was coming from China.. I ended up sending the dress back because what's the point having a dress that doesn't fit? I might recommend this dress if you're skinny and have a smaller chest."
2.0,"nice stone necklace, needs better images. It is large and smelled like diesel fuel."
2.0,These were waaaaay toooy small.I bought a 3T thinking he would grow in to them.... they were too small!
2.0,"didnt like the material, structure or the fit"
2.0,Retuned because  they  were not the beads I needed.
2.0,"Slightly disappointed. Because they are cut small,but there's another family member that can use them."
2.0,"Got the shirt on today. Was happy to try it on. Holy moly, the shirt is thin and from the model it looked like a long shirt. I wore it and it barely passed down beneath my belly button. The side of the shirt were showing my hips exposing my boxers. I wanted to like the shirt but they need to make a tall version."
2.0,I got a hole in them with in a week. All three of them have a hole
2.0,Looked absolutely nothing like picture. Made cheap. Looked like plastic
2.0,Shirt doesn’t stretch at all. Material is really thin for the price.
2.0,"Cute but it broke the first time i wore it, within the first hour."
2.0,I like the look of this bag and many of it's features but the main zipper gets a little stuck half way through.  I'm not going to bother to return it but  I am disappointed that I have to zip it back and forth to get it to close or open.
2.0,They were suppose to be wide  very slender hard to get on no front buttons or zipper or laces look cheap giving them away Thais is the first time I have been  disappointed  in a delivery from Amazon
2.0,"Soooo it’s going back.. I ordered this for a wedding and I wanted a shorter dress compared to one that comes to your knees, but omg. My cheeks hang out. I’m 5’4 125 lbs and ordered an xsmall. Quite shorter than I was looking for."
2.0,There too big!! I thought I ordered small size
2.0,To small not enough for my mobile and wallet in the same time
2.0,Very small and thin and certainly not an appropriate size for an adult. I’m very disappointed in this alpaca scarf.
2.0,Dress is very short exposes a little too much
2.0,I ordered two Luciano sweaters as Extra Large.  One I was able to send back because it was way too small even though I'm a large to extra large.  The other one was donated to my 10-year old nephew.  It fits him perfect..
2.0,I ordered a 2x and it feels more like a m/l it was wayyy to tight and its very see through. Its a cute dress and I would have loved to have kept it but it was just way too tight and unflattering and im a curvy girl.
2.0,Spring load post broke the first time I put the band on. That means one side of the band was stuck in my Fitbit and I had to scratch my Fitbit up prying it out.
2.0,"Nice material, fits close to your body if thats what your looking for. Semi see thru! I feel not made for a larger body."
2.0,"I was displeased with these bracelets the cameo style Queen head can barley be seen, it just really looks cheep"
2.0,"I really, really wanted the Frankenstein leggings and I got leggings with ""trick or treat"" on them.  I know they said mystery leggings, but they of course, put the coolest ones on the site and then you get what you get.  They were nice about it....I returned them."
2.0,Smaller than it appears. Not the greatest quality
2.0,"Super cute, but already torn in one week. Material is cheap."
2.0,"Rough fabric inside, too small"
2.0,"I got these to wear at my wedding and found out when they arrived, they are really unattractive when you wear them.  They were not as comfortable as I was hoping either."
2.0,I am so very sad. I love owls and was so excited to get thia shirt. Just to have it show up early and Not fit. I ordered a 3x and size wise is ment for a 1x. Im so disappointed especially since 3x is the largest size. Other then the size being off it seems to be made very well and i live the owl.
2.0,Was delivered without the headband shown.
2.0,Es muy pequeño. Como para un niño de 2 años.
2.0,"Okay I guess, but too big and WAY too much gold hardware.  Definitely need something more understated."
2.0,"I've been using these for a couple of weeks now, and I guess I am underwhelmed. Putting them on or off does not appreciably change the amount of glare or the ambient view of the road, even in rainy weather.<br /><br />UPDATE - reduced to two stars because when I am wearing these at night, it makes it harder to see pedestrians.<br /><br />I paid the lightning deal price and was not otherwise compensated."
2.0,Awful!! Im a 36D and bought the large. No support on the sides and the black mesh was a hot mess. Overall super cheap and not true to size.
2.0,They stretch out too much and the black ends up being gray. They also have a weird fit.
2.0,"The ring came in fast. It's beautiful designed, but complete costume. Within a week of daily wear, a stone chipped out, it started turning and turns my finger green. Great price for cheap ring."
2.0,Very cute but very small. I wouldn’t recommend it.
2.0,Its never arrived to my house. I was very looking forward to it. This is an prime item so it should of been here within a couple days but its been over a week now.
2.0,just after a month it started to check color
2.0,"1st watch analog clock lost 20 minutes in 3 hours, replacement watch battery was DOA, had a spare and replaced it. Day 3 the second hand froze.<br /><br />The watch bands are only held in place my friction fit pins the slip out fairly easy. Very unimpressed with watch but it was a good one for my 13 year olds first watch."
2.0,Thought the Amazon bag was empty. Earrings are very small.  But not expensive so will just keep them.
2.0,It's too tight so I am not likely it right now.  I wear US size 14 -16 and I bought the extra large and it's disappoin ting.
2.0,"Way to small but was my favorite dress pic for a wedding.  Lace is not real starchy but not soft either.  Good stretch, but still runs too small.  Too much hassle to return.  Wasted Money!"
2.0,Dress was very large - even for a small. Made me look bigger than I was. The material was thin but it would be fine as a bathing suit cover up.
2.0,One of the boots the loop for the shoe lace to enter through is broken. Total dissapointment.
2.0,Hard between toe.
2.0,"Purchased this for my daughter for career . Ordered  a M6-8 , the elastic in the pants are so tight . Very snug on my 5 year old who wears a 6"
2.0,"Super cute- but the lights don’t last long. Had to exchange the first one we bought bc the lights faded horribly, even with new batteries. The replacement does the same thing. It’s adorable without the lights, but if you’re purchasing specifically for the lights, may not be what you want."
2.0,"It looks nice and had just the right number of slots and id windows for me, but it didn’t last. I bought this in January and it started to come apart in the summer and now, in September it has almost completely come apart at the seam. It looks like the inside slots are sewn together, but the outside and the inside halves are glued together with some sort of rubbery edge between them. The sewn part is still holding together nicely, but once the edge started fraying, the glue just pulls apart pretty easily and quickly. You can see in the product pictures the stitching you see in the inside doesn’t go through to the outside. Maybe that’s why this one is falling apart easily. I don’t know, but the next one I buy I’ll look for one that has the stitching on the outside. By the way, the metallic fabric you see between the inside and outside half seems to be the RFID blocking material. I had two different key cards in the wallet and they sometimes works and sometime not when they are in the wallet. I think the card had to be closer and I had to wave it around a bit and would eventually pick up, so the blocking does seem to work."
2.0,"Nice enough and the LEDs were bright, but the mask broke after about an hour of wear."
2.0,"I ordered my usual size, and it would have fit if the front had been cut properly.  While there was plenty of fabric in the back, there was hardly enough fabric in front for the robe to close - certainly not enough to overlap and keep me covered.  When I pulled the robe snug around me, the sleeves ended up on the front of my shoulders rather than at my sides.  Other than the bad cut, the fabric felt great for a light-weight summer robe."
2.0,These shoes dont light up when stepping or stomping. It has a button for maully urning lights on and have to  pushing the button to get it to turn off. I was able to get these on myself but noticed it may be uncomfortable due to wiring and battery or electrical stuff under the heal
2.0,Was awesome at first but had for less than a week and the owl fell off and was lost while my daughter was at school.
2.0,"All the zipper area are very hard to use , and all three side pocket zippers are stripped!"
2.0,the dress is nice and i like the style but runs way to small for a 4x
2.0,Did not turn out to look like the pic. Did not fit well at all. To tight in the chest area.
2.0,"They are nice, but much smaller in size from what they appear to be in the website."
2.0,"Wrong color. I didn't get the color I ordered and it came pink and blue. I kept it because the design is still pretty cool. After Christmas, I guess we will see if the person likes the color that came or I'll be returning it."
2.0,Ordered a medium based on other reviews saying suit ran big im usually a large. Its fits everyewhere except the bust area is still redicously large I am a 38D and there was no support at all. Cute suit but cant really wear it due to the top being too big.
2.0,I got for my son sock day and his calves was to big.  these socks would fit someone with skinny calves.  I love the design just not flexible.
2.0,"It is made of quality matierials, however, it arrived in the wrong size. I sent it back and got a refund for a different product."
2.0,My granddaughter was disappointed they we're so small
2.0,Most of the flowers had fallen off. and the same exact thing is on Wish.com . for 2$
2.0,"I love my wax blue jeans but these were not of the same quality. They seemed very thin, and were super short on me. I'm 5' 7"", 125lb and ordered a size 5 like my other wax jeans. I was considering trying a 7, but I think I'm going to look around for a material that seems like it last."
2.0,Es débil se rompen con facilidad
2.0,No support poorly made you get what you pay for very cheap material
2.0,"It's cute and the fabric was soft, but it was way too small"
2.0,"Looks great, however I believe mine was a faulty product line.. the shoulders are so narrow. Compared to the rest of the sweat shirt!"
2.0,Runs smalllll
2.0,"Although the fit and material are OK, the manufacturing is poor.  The waist band will have a short life expectancy.  Decided to machine wash on gentle cycle before wearing them, sadly I discover seams that weren't sewn together and the fly is a very small opening.  Not a quality product and do not recommend them, so buyer beware."
2.0,"I ordered an XL as a 36D/DD. The band size was a little snug (which is ok - its a sports bra). I really wanted it to work. The fabric is soft and the color is vibrant. However, there is no way my boobs would fit into that. Spilling over everywhere.<br /><br />I am not sure why ordering an XL doesnt fit my cup size, given that it is the most commonly sold cup size!!"
2.0,"Fit great until the elastic on top snapped, causing the entire top half to fall to my waist.  Luckily I hadn’t yet left the house & could change. Fabric is soft & colors vibrant.  Figure flattering (until the elastic failed)."
2.0,It only came with 4 sets should have been 5. Thy were not even close to fitting my half jacket frames.
2.0,One came in fine but the other ring was bent when I received it.
2.0,"too big. ordered xs. 5’5” 110lbs i normally wear an xs. it was way too baggy in the top and waist. did not fit like an xs, more toward the larger fitting side of a small, or a medium."
2.0,The sunflower is cute. The one with stripes is unfinished. The wrapping isn’t secured like the sunflower one.
2.0,"I personally do not care for this suit. The top and bottoms do not match. The bottoms are bright pink, like a piece of bubble gum and the top is purple, blue, teal, and white. The clasp on the top is made of clear plastic. You have to slide them together and then it snap it shut. The top is supposed to be twisted  but the one I got is not. You have to twist it yourself before you put it on. I received this swimsuit​ at a discount in exchange for my honest review.​"
2.0,"Feels cheap. Not that comfortable. Also too small (ordered large 180lbs, 5'9). I returned it."
2.0,"The design isn’t centered, it came with white smudges around it, almost like deodorant. And I ordered a small and the shirt is very wide."
2.0,This is a nice looking piece of jewelry but after wearing it only 2 days one of the strands broke off from the band. I took it to the jeweler and they want $50 to fix it!!!!
2.0,They are fine but my order came with 6 all correct color but one instead of red I got a grey and I specifically ordered this set as I needed red.
2.0,So it sags from my shoulder and my neck line droops.  It's comfortable though.
2.0,"Just received my item and only rcvd one in the bag,  the description states 3 pack , are the other items shipping separately because there is no indication and stating my package was fully delivered when this is incorrect. I would like my other two please thank you"
2.0,Used 3 days and the metal part of strap broke.
2.0,Got these as a stocking stuffer for the grandkids and most of them didn't work which was very regrettable because the ones the did were really amazing and fun for the kids. This might be something worth getting if you have three or four grandkids and could go through before hand and find out which ones worked.
2.0,"I’m a registered nurse. I try to wear compression socks. I am in the size i should be and out of 6 pair only one pair had enough stretch to get them on. Then when they’re on the feel overly compressed. These are more a size large/long. If you wear ex large, I suggest you find alternate socks."
2.0,Thought the Ts should be smooth. But it’s has small hole/dots so the image is kind of deceiving.
2.0,"My toddler hated them and I can see why.  Cheap material that didn’t feel comfortable, also worn once and already looks months old."
2.0,I really want to like this product and keep it but in the end I decided to return it and get my money back.<br /><br />What I like:<br />It is very easy to switch the factory band to this chain band. Adjusting and taking out each link is very easy with the supplied tools.<br /><br />The finish is very sharp looking as it was meant to be on this watch.<br /><br />The ugly:<br /><br />After installing the metal ban there is a noticeable gap between the band and watch body. It also exposed part of the pin that is keeping the the watch together. It may or may not let some debris get between it and jamming it or worst pop the pin out of place and the watch falling to the floor.<br /><br />You get what you pay for with the quality control and craftsmanship.
2.0,"Based on other reviews, I expected this shirt to be loose fitting. I have a 7 month old and just found out I'm pregnant again so I was hoping it would be loose enough to be comfortable and hide the baby weight I haven't lost as well as accommodate another baby bump. The shirt I received is definitely not loose. I found it to be pretty tight on my chest and unflattering for a mom belly. Disappointed but back it goes."
2.0,Much smaller than the picture shows. Very pretty though.
2.0,"No hold, definitely more cotton feel which I didn’t realize at first."
2.0,"my main gripe is i thought this would come with a remote control and it doesnt.<br />battery life does not last for a whole day, you can get thru a half day before you need to recharge it."
2.0,Runs very SMALL
2.0,Pretty fabric but the top did not fit correctly...too wide across the shoulders. I am 5’ tall and weigh 110. I ordered the small; still too large on top.Returning.
2.0,The clasp does not work on the dog tag. It always comes off the pendant.
2.0,"I don’t really know why this got great reviews from other people, because I found the fabric to look very cheap. It’s thin enough that for the bodice, you can see the seams of the lining going up, which looks quite hideous. You can see it if you zoom in on my photo for the top part. And for the slit, the fabric puckers and just looks awkward. I wouldn’t wear this dress out."
2.0,"Product is way too heavy and dangerous for young kids.  Was going to give to my 3 year old until I realized the metal hair clip parts could easily cut her head or put an eye out.  Probably great for bigger kids, but I doubt they’d want to wear a costume crown."
2.0,The style is exactly what we were looking for for a costume but we were planning to use it with a white button up and it is definitely cream. Pictures included for comparison.
2.0,It is a lot lighter than pictured. I got the largest size and it fit like a small/medium. The cape is one size fits one size neck. It is almost choking me. Cute costume but wish the sizing was more accurate.
2.0,"It wasn’t the color I thought it would be and it didn’t fit me, cut too round around the hips. Not straight line."
2.0,"Nice looking, good quality watch. Was not nearly as bright as shown, even in the dark."
2.0,I love the design and the color of the shirt but overall the price seems high for the quality. This is a fruit of the loom brand shirt and was not aware of that when purchasing it. The shirt fits nice on the top but really wide on the bottom and billows out in back. Had it not been for the design I would have sent it back.
2.0,"Fit is great, not see through at all! However, the design is slightly tragic because the whole leggings are dark except for a white strip on the groin and butt area which looks very very odd. This product is not the same as the photos, at least for what I received. I got a size medium. True to size."
2.0,"A wider strap would have made this more stable. It does hold if no other mount options are available, just be prepared to pull it as tight as you possibly can without your eyeballs bulging."
2.0,The material wasn’t great it felt more like a support than a waist sweat band. It runs small all around. It barely covered my stomach.
2.0,Straps won’t stay tight and keep falling of her shoulders
2.0,"The color is is great, but that's it.  The quality is horrible, especially the straps.  I carry a good amount of stuff in my purse and there is no way this would hold up.  I returned it."
2.0,Way too small. Ordered my normal ring size and couldn't get it pass my knuckle.
2.0,"Material is hard and stiff, not what you want in a tshirt.<br />Hoping the wash might help.<br />It’s boxie and doesn’t hang well."
2.0,Too big for girls
2.0,These earrings look better on the computer screen than they do in your hand. I was disappointed - they look cheaply made.
2.0,"I returned it. It was just awkward and there was a lot of falling out from the bottom. I am a 36DD, I saw that some bustier women had success, but none of them were me."
2.0,Don't like the back hooks.. it gets undone.
2.0,"Not as expected contains spandex, thought it would be 100% soft organic cotton, disappointed."
2.0,Posting this for my wife who for I purchases this.  I guess she is hoping to fit them eventually because she did not give them back to be to return.
2.0,"I was looking for a pair of workbooks to use around the house. They fit as expected and I was in love with them at first. After 2 weeks, I had to superglue the soles as they were already coming apart. They're cute, but I'm not sold on how long they've lasted."
2.0,Cute wedges. Wore them on my trip to Dallas. Not a good traveling shoe. Put them on later to go out a couple of nights later to dinner. Not supportive as I thought they would be. Had the bottom of the front part of my feet hurting as though pins were pricking them. Would not advise purchasing. Cute shoe but not worth it. Will be going to the trash when I get home. Don’t even want to give them to Goodwill to pass on to someone else to endure the pain. That uncomfortable.
2.0,High waist wants to roll up. Not comfortable
2.0,"Although the practice of motions to go through could be calming, the piece doesn't do anything except give you something physical to hold.  I thought it might slow down the exhale so that you were forced to push it out a little more? Just a little tube that you blow through."
2.0,"I returned these. In the photo it appears that its an over-the- knee boot but mine only covered my calves (im 5'9) Also the boots felt cheaply made, wouldnt be suprised if they fell apart after a few wears"
2.0,"I'm typically a medium, average/petite build so I got this in a medium and it definitely just wouldn't sit right on me and I think a large would've been way too big. I love how it looks on the model in the picture but it just made me look really frumpy. I think this would work great if you are tall and lean, or maybe if you have a booty."
2.0,Has to be a knock off. Zipper is junk and down filling is falling out.
2.0,Me tocó deforme y desproporcionado..
2.0,i love it but the color changed within 3 days
2.0,Extra baggy bigger than expected. Had to return
2.0,For some reason the grey shirt was a couple inches shorter than the others.  This is a quality control issue. I guess I should expect this from time to time from off shored manufacturer
2.0,"I'm disappointed when I received a wrong color, I order blue.  This dress could have been beautiful but the materials are seems to be cheap and not pretty at all.  will not recommend it."
2.0,"I have no idea, if it fits or if it is even the correct size this time because the first one ordered was sent in the wrong size and shipped to the state of Vermont because it was a Christmas gift for my daughter and we were spending Christmas in Vermont with family, THE corrected order was automatically shipped  to the Vermont address also! I live in Illinois, so my daughter still does not her Christmas gift."
2.0,"Excess thread was hanging from under the band of the dress. I was afraid to snip it, in fear that it would unravel. I am going to return this item, but it is unfortunate the cost of shipping will be deducted from my return amount. That's bizarre given it's not my fault the make of the dress is poor quality."
2.0,Returned because I can see through both layers of fabric completely. Totally see through. Bought in black.
2.0,Def from China because it was crazy big
2.0,The product was not real leather & cheaply made
2.0,"These are very very cute shoes, but my daughter wore them once and they fell apart. They aren't very durable which is something I expect in kids shoes. A little bummed out that they wore down that fast."
2.0,Too small. I like the design but can't wear it
2.0,"I couldn't get it over my head, runs very small."
2.0,"too short, rides up."
2.0,"Looked ok for my purpose intended but cut way too small in hip, waist and crotch.  I wear 20/22 and this was 22 and way to snug.  Even tight undergarment could not help the odd binding cut of this garment."
2.0,They shipped out the wrong size I'm a 32 and they shipped a 34... Currently trying to shrink them around the waist.
2.0,Didn't like the fit at all on me.
2.0,"Came broken.  Otherwise, pretty.  fairly sad because i wanted them for my wedding."
2.0,"Adorable in their own respect, I knew they would be cheap but I thought they'd at least look less like I got them from a quarter machine at Wal-Mart."
2.0,The broke on me after 4 wears. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,I like the beads but not the finish of the bracelet. The end loops aren't done clean so the end of the wire pokes me and gets caught in my clothes. I will probably end up re-stringing it on memory wire.
2.0,"Very small! I also don't think it's surgical steel, my ears had a reaction to them. Shipping took forever."
2.0,I usually wear a M or L and these were quite big & do not stay in place well! Legs ride up while I'm cycling and find I'm always wanting to pull them back down. Would not order again
2.0,Don't like the band...
2.0,Really hard to get wrinkles out.
2.0,Very pretty and even better in person. I purchased this for my daughter’s teacher and it broke the first day. I feel horrible now. I bought another one for someone else but haven’t given it to them yet and now I’m worried the same thing is going to happen.
2.0,It's nothing like what they describe.
2.0,Hem on the skirt portion ripped out when I bent over to put my heels on. If you have thick thighs beware.
2.0,Gorgeous ring. Turned my finger green fast. So disappointing!!
2.0,"Chain is difficult to straighten out. Not long enough for an anklet, and must have small wrists. Almost intended to be for child."
2.0,There is nothing to it. It just feels cheap (which it is)
2.0,"Says it is oversize but its not. The neck hole is small, my head barely fits through comfortably.  This will probably shrink in the wash."
2.0,This is a nice item but the small was too large for me at 5'6 and 121 p. It is meant for a larger person. The fabric is quite nice and soft and the print is very pretty.
2.0,The watch bands look great. The fit is a little less precise then hoped. This allows the band to move more at the bezel. The pin is then side loaded and can't handle the motion it's being put through and eventually let go. I've had my watch fall twice to the floor. I probably won't buy again.<br />The glass screen protectors look good and work great. So there's that.
2.0,This is not red. It is a redish orange. Not what my husband wanted
2.0,"I got this for my husband and thought it would be nicer than it was, the chain was nice but the watch itself was very bulky, made of plastic and definitely made for a child. i didn't realize that it spoke but was happy that it did until realizing it only said the 1 LONG them phrase over and over again. We decided to return it so i contacted the company through amazon and never heard from. i eventually called and experienced terrible customer service! No i won't be ordering from this company ever again!"
2.0,well made but really small. a little bit bigger than a quarter. not worth price and shipping
2.0,"Pretty, just small"
2.0,These run SUPER SMALL I sized up and they are still way too small which really sucks because my daughters were really looking forward to them. So disappointed. They're cute but on top of the being ridiculously small they're also see through. Just a bad product.
2.0,These pants are extremely see through! You can see the outline of the pockets. I have a mid thigh tattoo and you can see it right through the pants.<br /><br />2 stars because they fit well and came within the time frame. But I would not recommend these to anyone.
2.0,The seams in the arm opening ripped twice as I put the robe on and took it off for the first time. The stitching should be stronger.
2.0,Not aluminum.  Rusts.
2.0,"Great sole material but not possible to slip on these otherwise flimsy slippers.  But for the price, I suppose they're OK to walk out for the paper and dog walks but don't yet know for sure.  Would not buy again as for a few extra bucks I would buy a higher quality (not made in C. junky feely).  Delivered in a dirt-attracting plastic envelope with no box or other means of protection.  The filthy white bag kind of sours your anticipation of what is inside...wife would not touch the dirty bag and questioned what could possibly be inside....soil sample would work."
2.0,"Unfortunately this came totally crushed and after many attempts to fluff it back up, it was a fail."
2.0,"It's a cute dress, but a bit to big around the bottom.  I kept it, but don't know if I would buy it again,"
2.0,"The pair I received was bent/twisted around. Other than that, they just didn't fit or even stay in place. Uncomfy to wear."
2.0,Too Small!!!
2.0,it fell after one month
2.0,"MUCH smaller than I expected, which saddens me because the jeans themselves look like they could be very comfortable. I would definitely recommend ordering at least 2 or 3 sizes bigger."
2.0,Really pretty but broke really easily
2.0,Most of the parts broke shortly after use. None of the parts are put together well. Glue came loose in many parts.
2.0,I expected the size to be small so I ordered the 2xl rather than the normal large that I wear. The 2x was still tight across the shoulders and cut oddly so it was very uncomfortable fit.
2.0,Nice looking chain. Broke after 3 weeks of normal wear. I take it off at night and in shower.
2.0,I ordered two sizes and couldn't tell the difference between the two.  Even the larger size was still way too fitted.
2.0,Bought for my toddler.  They are quite heavy and they droop on her ears.  Not designed for small children.
2.0,I didn't like the waist band. I typically wear the calvin klein &#34;radiant logo' and prefer the soft silky waist band over these.
2.0,"These were just kind of weird, neither of my sons liked them AT ALL."
2.0,fell apart easily
2.0,Stopped charging after a few uses..less than a week
2.0,"Nice length and weight, but the stones are VERY pale, nothing like the photo. You can barely see the colors! Sadly, I’m sending these back. Disappointing purchase."
2.0,All the side jewels have fallen out had maybe 2 months but I have had a lot of compliments
2.0,"My jacket is great but a little slow on arrival, my wife also had slow service and then they said no exchange after 2 weeks even tho it took longer than that to arrive!"
2.0,Cheap and broke taking them out of the package
2.0,Returned; completely see through
2.0,Fit ok but material is not what I would wear
2.0,Didnt fit!
2.0,"I am a size 10 or 12 and this advertises that it goes up to size 12. It was very snug, which I wouldn't mind too much, since compression is good while on an airplane, but the downside is after wearing it for 9 hours on a plan, the crotch area separated in several places causing multiple holes where the stitching is. I would not recommend purchasing if you are a 10/12. Perhaps smaller women wouldn't cause holes."
2.0,"When first using it, it worked great.  I purchased in Aug/Sept time frame.  It is now November and the zippers are now separating upon unzipping."
2.0,The stitching was not good so the lace was dangling upon arrival. My 7 year old has a tummy and this was tight on her.
2.0,Bought as a Christmas gift. Worn daily and with in 4 months the lettering has almost completely worn off.
2.0,"It’s a cute dress, but it’s a horrible quality dress.<br />My daughter wore it for pictures and said it felt super itchy and took it off.<br />If it stretches it turns white.<br />It’s good for the money I guess🤷🏼‍♀️"
2.0,Arrived damaged. Cheap metal and much larger than expected. Does not fit well with other Major brand dangle charms.
2.0,Its nice but broke shortly after
2.0,The waist band digs in a bit  and the leg is too loose and I needed a longer inseam.
2.0,"It’s not what I expected very cheap,y made but I kept it for the price will give away to someone smaller"
2.0,Very awkward to wear. So stuff around the neck. Feels very thin and cheap fleece. Sending back
2.0,"This was advertised as a &#34;coat&#34; and one size fits all.  I usually wear a med/large sweater, but when I put this on with a very thin sweater, to wear as a coat, it was too tight, too short and the lapels look much larger in the picture than they are on a person."
2.0,I’m really in the market for some socks that will not fall down under my dress boots.  These not only don’t stay up but they also pill after the first wash/dry.  It is possible they should be put in dryer and I missed that direction.
2.0,Nice watch didnt care for the styling wasnt packaged
2.0,"Comfortable, but poor workmanship.  Some have the fly sewn closed. One didn't have the crotch sewn. They left it open. Cheap product."
2.0,Terribly small. Over all bad fit. Returned immediately
2.0,"Super long (down to my mid shins) and cheap light fabric. Design was cute, but everything else was cheap. Returned."
2.0,Creates more back fat at the bra area. Not what I expected. I ended up buying a replacement for this.
2.0,Shirt looks really nice but I was sent the wrong size
2.0,Cute romper but to short. I'm 5'4 and tried both the medium and large and both rode up and was not roomy enough on the inside. More for shorter people .
2.0,"Comfy but unlikely to buy another pair, because the zippers are all jacked up. The zippers don’t work at all anymore, and went from minor annoyance to progressively worse to the point they can’t zip at all."
2.0,"It's made of rayon, or polyester, and the size definitely runs small. The stitching is a bit 'off' all over, the seams kind of wandered a bit. They included an ""obi"" kind of a thing, I don't know if that's supposed to be for costume or what, but maybe putting the cost of making that into better quality stitching and fabric might be better. I generally don't leave low-star reviews, I just never buy the product again, but I thought I had better put a warning. Two stars because it *was* actually long enough."
2.0,I’m not pleased with how the balls break in half And  into pieces when u try to put them on! Over half have broke! ☹️👎🏻
2.0,"They're very pretty, but the ball was impossible to get off!"
2.0,The sleeves were way too tight on me
2.0,Shirt was way smaller than pants! 0
2.0,"appreciated how quickly it came and was pretty, but it did not fit. the stud is extremely short and the thread in the ball must've gotten messed up in the cutting because it did not close again once I took the ball off."
2.0,at this point not too impressed with socks .wore yesterday inside and out with snow on ground and under a pair of socks. my feet were cold all day. going to give them another try to see what happen. my husband said his gloves did not keep his hand warm
2.0,"I am 5 foot 4 inches and 110 pounds, This is not form fitting on me like in the picture. It is baggy"
2.0,"After you wash them the band gets all twisted up. They are on target with comfort and size, but the band cheaply made."
2.0,Some kind of spandex poly blend. Seams were sewn askew. Pockets were not symmetrical to each other and were very loose and slouchy. Returned it.
2.0,not very happy with the finish of this item.  Marked 925 and does seem to be sterling silver however it has the look of stainless steel.  Not a very nice finish on the piece.  I was disappointed and ended up buying from a different vender
2.0,Thought the material would be more substantial.
2.0,The pants did not look like the picture.
2.0,"They are very thin, you can clearly see your crotch lines. Comfortable for lounging around house but you can’t exactly wear out"
2.0,The product was damaged like it had been stepped on by somebody
2.0,Feels good seems about right sizing. Does not look like pictures at all though
2.0,The La casa de paper faces looks bigger when you put the socks on you.  The  printing ink doesn’t go all the way through the inside of the socks so when you wear it has white lines showing throughout the socks.
2.0,Don’t work using cellphone
2.0,The knit fabric on the hat is nice for winter. The trim/piping is sewn in the transition from top to back in a point. Makes the hat look weird and wrong.
2.0,I bought a size larger based on the reviews saying that the item runs small but the blouse does not run small.  Had to return the shirt.
2.0,But they should stick to making tractors...
2.0,Didn't like that the material pattern on the front wasn't the same on back.
2.0,"Returned, low quality and one lens was loose"
2.0,"The shorts fit great and are super cute, the top is a  crop top that I could barely get over my arms and once I managed to they did not fit my boobs AT ALL. I'm mom chubby at worst and my boobs are only a 36C So I was pretty disappointed"
2.0,"These sunglasses are way too big for my small 4.5 year old.  I'd recommend them for an older child.  Excellent packaging, however.  They arrived with a nice case."
2.0,"Shirt initially was super comfortable but I had to stop wearing it when working out, the shirt just digs into your armpits and rubs the heck out of them. Had to stop my workout to take the shirt off before it got worse"
2.0,I ordered these to go on a ski trip I thought the price was pretty great but when I received them they were very thing and since it’s stitched there were a lot of holes so if you’re looking for something warm to cover you up this is not the product for you
2.0,The red wine color is not red wine. It is a straight up purple
2.0,The rope/string pulled out of hole after a couple of weeks of using.  I am thinking of returning it.  I like the outside pocket and inside zippered pocket.  But it needs to hold up.  If they would have reinforced the ropes so they didn't rip out it would have been a good bag.
2.0,"It is very flimsy and short ,"
2.0,"There's a small chip out of one of the studs, other than that there ok."
2.0,Talla M es muy grande.
2.0,"Look cheaply made and much smaller than what I expected.  I immediately returned them, had to pay shipping twice.  Since the paperwork inside said &#34;must be returned in unopened packaging&#34; I was not able to take them out of the small plastic bag to inspect further."
2.0,It was cute but made out of cheap material. It runs large as well.
2.0,"It’s warm enough. It was about a size bigger than it needed to be. I went to play in the snow with my boys in it. Put it in the dryer after, the seams in the middle of the inside cane apart. First time in any kind of machine! So needless to say, I’m disappointed"
2.0,"Pros: Very light on your face<br />Cons: Very light and flimsy all around. Lenses seem to want to fall out constantly and the frame feels like a few to many sheets of paper on top of them would flaten it. Cheap pair, you get what you pay for."
2.0,These are so cheaply made. The post break easily. Bought for a kid who fell in love of the different colors. But now she can even wear them
2.0,Small and very short!
2.0,Too small but pretty.  So if I lose some weight I'm sure I will love.
2.0,"Lasted less than a month before one of then busted, definitely not a great quality"
2.0,Little narrow.
2.0,"Comes wadded up in a bag--you will have to get the wrinkles out.  Clearly you get what you pay for--feels like liner is about to fall out, cut not even, buttons are all about to fall off right out of the bag.  This product may last a few wearings, best to avoid unless you like to throw money away"
2.0,Not real silver plated
2.0,"My ears where covered, but there wasn't any room for my small headphones."
2.0,"Purchased this dress in Large. The material is thick and nice. However, for a wrap dress it is very small on top. I am 36ddd and wrap dress usually fits well but this one did not. Also, slot is sexy but opens too high as you walk. Definitely returning."
2.0,Way too small - I'm a 10/12 and was scared to rip it if I zipped it. XL could maybe fit a narrow hipped 10. Cute and nice material though.
2.0,This cut off my circulation and was crazy uncomfortable. The bottom IS non-slip and the length is a little long for me.  i don't get why you would make this top so tight...especially when this is for use for elderly and hospital patients.  I wanted it for after knee replacement.  It was not friendly for this type of surgery.
2.0,"This is larger than expected for a ""minimalist"" wallet.  Also the materiel that has the RFID protection was more a problem than benefit."
2.0,The waist band on the skirt is tight and creates bulge. Plus the bottom of the skirt sags from the slit in the back.
2.0,Was really pretty but after a week the paint is aready coming off.. this is not worth 50.00 when the design is not sealed right..
2.0,"I wear a 14 on top and a twelve on the bottom. I got a 3XL which was supposed to be an American size 14. Arms fit, large chest fit and then it just hangs on you like an oversized cape. Not a good look if you are chesty and have any curves."
2.0,I was happy to find yoga pants in this length but sadly the quality is poor-the elastic twists up in the waist band and does not lie flat.
2.0,"I really wanted the sweater to look like the example picture, but alas I should’ve known better than to trust a one size fits all. The sweater was quite itchy in the few minutes I had it on. That in itself wouldn’t have made me return it because there’s softener and such. The fit just wasn’t working for me. More specifically, because of the open seams on the side, the front and back had a lot of long bunched up material. Just wasn’t a fan of the silhouette.  I am 5”4’ and 155 lb. Usually wear a S-M sweater depending on the brand."
2.0,"A little big. There is some slack around the top/chest. Arrived with the tag cut out. Not sure if it is the correct size or even new.<br />Overall, very cheap looking."
2.0,They are not xxl.... can’t use them squeeze my temples
2.0,Kinda itchy and not very stretchy. But they are warm.
2.0,"I should have expected disappointment. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Looks good from a distance, but not up close."
2.0,"I selected as per the vendor size chart a dress that will fit 6-7 years old girls, hopping I'll get it to fit loose,  mine daughter is only 4 and half years old, regular height according to her age and the dress is too small on her, the size advertised by the vendor supposedly  to fit 6-7 years old, will fit a 2-3 years old girl instead."
2.0,Came on time but all tangled up!
2.0,"I love this shirt, but I washed and dried it and it’s a little on the small side now."
2.0,"The chain on the necklace was very disappointing! It looks like one you would get out of vending machine.. Was very disappointed only for that reason, the avocado itself was nice. Good color"
2.0,I liked the bras except for the fact they fit wait too tight around the shoulder/neck area.  I first ordered the recommended size for me (medium).  I returned those and sized up to a large but still felt too tight.  I realize sports bras should fit snug but this was beyond snug and was very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Aside from this phone case feeling like a cheap piece of plastic, it's also super difficult to open the charging tab on the bottom, it makes the phone's speakers sound horrible, the kick stand is flimsy and feels like it'll break off of I actually use it, the screen scratches very easily (just with regular use, no drops, I don't wear jewelry, I carry it in my pocket not my bag). I'm pretty disappointed with this purchase. But, if all your looking for is something to protect your phone and you don't care about having to use a flathead screwdriver to open the charging port every time, then it's fine."
2.0,Ok.  But for the price I don’t like it.  Seems cheap.  I rather go directly to Nike.
2.0,"These shoes are pretty and nice soft leather, however I cannot wakk in them. My toes completely go forward and stick out beyond the shoe. It looks really bad and very frustrating to walk in. Wore them so can't return them."
2.0,After filling the slots with cards after a month the inside lining that holds the cards tore and the cards slip out the side of it. I gave it a 2 since it is a good looking wallet but beyond that invest in American made real leather.
2.0,"This shirt was perfect out of the wrapping but after the first wash it started pilling under the armpits really bad. I’ve use my sweater shaver on it twice and now the material is getting to thin. It also lost a lot of its color after the first wash. I wash my dark office attire in cold water, no bleach and hang to dry so it should not have looked this bad after the 10th wash let alone the 1st wash."
2.0,Not good for night driving!! Very cheaply made!!!
2.0,Ordered an extra large which would normally be too big and this shirt was still way too small.
2.0,"Fit and finish....superb.  For that you get 2 stars...very nice finish, the edges are all polished and the surface treatment is striking.  Even a fancy box which I don't need...but it is fancy packaging.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's let down a few points for me.  1) is it's much bigger than it  needs to be.  It could be half the size and it would fit in your pocket much better.  2)  The spring tension on the hasp is too strong and the hasp itself is a but clumsy under the thumb to push inward far enough to get your ring off or unhook from your belt loop. 3) Again...too big, if the loops were just a bit thinner I might actually be able to fit a lone key (no ring) on the loop, but nope, we don't have that option."
2.0,"I bought this dress in a size 16 which was way too large in the bust and shoulders and in a size 14 which was too small in the bust and arms.  Normally, I wear a size 12 P or 14 Petite depending on the waist.  As I'm older, my waist has thickened to match my hips.<br />This dress just isn't proportional across the dress.  It's a shame.  I love the idea of a large portrait neckline."
2.0,I FOUND THEM VERY HARD TO PUT ON AND DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOK
2.0,Much bigger than actual 0g.
2.0,"These Copper Fit compression socks are not easy to put on and take off, despite what Copper Fit claims!"
2.0,"Cheap, but the pair I was sent was not polarized. .."
2.0,"Very simple and painless method of return. Good thing or it would have been one star.<br /><br />Simply put, these run big as warned over and over again. I expected that. But the stitching is terrible. As I attempted to unbutton it for the first time, two of the buttons were already getting caught in the loose threads. Trying it on, and then unbuttoned a second time. All but one button holes had threads coming loose. Returning and not likely to try a second time."
2.0,There was no velcro strap which was like the entire reason I bought these...
2.0,"I bought this dress and was excited about it.  I bought the size according to the size guide, which was a large for what is typically a Medium body.  It was CRAZY tight.  Here's the thing, there was no size on the dress to confirm that the right size was sent.  There was nothing.  It could be a beautiful dress but the sizing is crazy.  One last thing, the picture shows a belt, there was not belt and there weren't any belt loops for one to go through.  I didn't reorder because I couldn't tell if it had even been the correct size to begin with.  I say don't bother."
2.0,"Hated em. Thin, flimsy, terrible when wet. They cling to you if wet, weird fit, flimsy thin.  I'll never understand why a company can make and sell tried n true items for that many decades successfully then up and decide to change it. Smh no more REAL Birdwell's is a shame. Returned."
2.0,It's not terrible but it's not very good either.  Plus I needed the metal to be yellow goldtone and instead its pink gold.  Wouldn't buy it if I were you.
2.0,"While this is a pretty looking bra, I was disappointed on several levels. The ""band"" under the cups has no support & the straps are not adjustable. The size I ordered that was supposed to fit a 36-C regular bra was a bit too snug. There are only 2 lines of hook & eyes on the front closure. I had to use the loosest one, which even then made it look like I had on a push-up bra that produced too much cleavage. The straps & back are made from a very thin stretchy material that would have been comfortable had the bra fit. If you are smaller busted this bra might be a good fit...but the advertisement I saw that said this is ""a great bra for older women"" in non-sensical."
2.0,"I have ordered three pairs of this style of Telic Z-strap sandal in a size 10 Medium. All three pairs were marked as  size 10 Medium. However,  NONE of the three pairs I received were sized correctly.  You could SEE that they were not the same sizes without putting them on.  The one pair was actually a size 10 in length but were a wide width.  The other two were a Medium width but were a 9 in length.  Sadly, ALL three had to be returned.  IF I could have received an ACTUAL 10 Medium, I would have loved them.  They would be 5 stars!  I have this brand in the flip flop style and love them.  I am done trying to order these online and have not been able to find them in stores."
2.0,Very pretty but top was too small.
2.0,Good fit but they balloon out which makes it look like you're wearing safari shorts. I've yet to wear them because they look weird with everything.
2.0,Love these but very disappointed that they didn't last but a day.
2.0,"My girlfriend walked around my house for a few hours, and they already developed holes."
2.0,Poor fitting in bust & arms
2.0,"Not what I expected, very tiny writing and lightweight. Obviously not something you would want to make a lasting impression with, unless you want her to think that your very frugal."
2.0,Wish I would have taken pictures before I sent it back. Awkward in both bust and skirt. Definetly not made for people with shorter torsos. Or short in general (I'm 5'2&#34;)
2.0,After one use the canvas around the grommets started to fray. Returning it.
2.0,"These were huge, way too big to carry around in your pocket.  Wish I could exchange for smaller, but I can't find a place to get a hold of the seller, which is why I'm giving 2 stars."
2.0,the colors were way off. had to send back
2.0,Couldn’t remember where I bought this so time expired for returning by the time I figured it out. Boo! 😒
2.0,"Cute blouse.  Unfortunately, it was WAY too small.  I completely agree with the comments about the arms being too tight.  I wear a 16/18 and ordered the XXXXL.  Too small.  Bought to wear in a Veteran's Day parade Monday.  Looks like I'm going shopping."
2.0,"I ordered an XL and expected the top to be big enough to wear on top of exercise shirts.  Unfortunately, the shirt was tight in top, and the length to short- almost like a crop top although it wasn’t described as such."
2.0,This is not a knee high compression sock. It is crew length. It does keep my post operative swelling down but there is a huge indent at mid calf where the sock ends.
2.0,Bought these lights for class halloween party and we were hard pressed to find 30 that would light up!  Not worth the money.  Very disappointing.
2.0,Eh I took a risk. The reviews were alright but there were a few who said they broke quick. It looked sleek and I couldn't resist.
2.0,I choose one qith pastel pink/blues/greens and the front of the was perfect. BUT there was was large RED portion on the back of the shirt which looks completely off because it doesn't match the rest of the shirt. It's awful looking.
2.0,"Fabric and Velcro is cheap, itchy to the skin."
2.0,"the print is pretty, but the size is way off"
2.0,the bottoms were fine but the top doesnt fit well
2.0,"The picture with the bracelet on an arm appears to be a male arm, however the bracelet is at lest 2 beads too short for a man's wrist. Three wxtra breads would probably do it. So my review is; it doesn't fit."
2.0,"These are cute, but the quality is awful. After wearing the pants for one day, the seam at the crotch was pulling apart so my underwear could be seen. I bought the correct size and they fit well, but material is just so cheap."
2.0,"cool hoodie but ridiculously small and overpriced. For the price, i was already on the fence, but the design was cool and o figured, if it fit, oh well, call it a splurge. Well even in the largest size it was really, really small. Had to eat the shipling costs when returned- all in all - just a waste of money- threw cash and time down the drain with this one"
2.0,"Much thinner than I was expecting, quality was not where it should have been for the Helly Hansen name brand items"
2.0,It was nice but ran too small had to gift it on I really liked  it  but was disappointed in the fit!!
2.0,"For almost $30 , the quality should have been much better. The print isn’t as nice in person. Going back."
2.0,They have a lot of loose stitching on te inside. I don't like that.
2.0,The color of the stone looks nothing like the photo. There is no shine to it. Just a dull brown. The stone is mounted to the silver backing.  And the backing is not very pretty.<br /><br />My ears began to immediately itch when I put them on.
2.0,When these arrived one of the bracelets was broken.
2.0,Medium t-shirts always fit me. This thing is like an XXL on me.
2.0,The gloves are definitely warm but not what I expected.  I thought that they opened up where the Velcro meets the glove so I could see my son slide his hand in.  It's a fully closed glove and the Velcro portion doesn't help tighten the glove around the hand.  As my son is playing in the snow the gloves as constantly sliding off regardless of how tight I attempt to wrap the glove.  Disappointing.
2.0,Was very pretty but broke.
2.0,De muy mala calidad le sale mucha pelusa
2.0,"I never have anything negative against their pins. the quality on these are awesome, but the backs of them aren't straight like their big ones. only one was, the other 3 were either straight down or tilted. I got the front straight like it would be on my shirt, but as you can see, the backs aren't."
2.0,Umm....$43 for a hat?<br /><br />I get that it’s wool but please
2.0,The silver balls next to the face are attached and this makes the watch is to big for my wrist.
2.0,Too big but size I thought
2.0,Pants are 6 inches too long for me to wear them.  Returned.  I'm 5'3&#34;
2.0,"It’s not the worst product ever, but it definitely doesn’t look like the picture. Positive is that it is warm. Returned."
2.0,"It was short and tight on me.  I ordered it as a cute sexy but not too sexy summer sun dress.  The type that makes it look like you tried, but not too hard. I ordered my normal size but I’m extremely tall.  Could I get it on my body? Yes. Was it a cute design? Also yes. Am I ever going to wear it? Nope. Gave it to my tween daughter. She’s thrilled with it. 🤷🏾‍♀️<br /><br />I’m aware that some people like a shorter dress, sometimes I do too, but this style didn’t do my build any favors. Fabric was also a bit thin. It was not the subtly sexy sundress of my dreams."
2.0,Disappointed that the titanium is limited to the post only.  I am ordering this specifically for this reason. Coat them with polish and hope it stays or send them back?????
2.0,"These lounge pants are really comfortable. Unfortunately they are made for guys with no ""equipment"". They are so tight in the private area they scruntch your stuff up. And almost as bad, the pockets are like 4 inches deep. Don't lean forward with you phone in your pocket while taking a leak......hope you've got quick hands when your phone constantly pops out of you pocket."
2.0,It is not true to size I wear a large  ordered a xxlarge in this dress and I couyeven get in it
2.0,I returned this dress because the color looked more like hospital-scrubs-green. It was also much larger than I expected it to hang
2.0,Weak clasp. That's why I return it.
2.0,The dress was cute but the cut was not proportional.  It was really big in the shoulders  and really small in the mid section .
2.0,My heads not tall enough to fit the crown of this hat. Frankensteins monster maybe. But was warm when resting over my eyes.
2.0,"If you have a short 2-3 inch beard this would work, but not for longer beards as they advertise"
2.0,"Would be great if it actually fit.  I have an average length torso and am very slim- this can only be worn if you don't mind it getting stuffed in all your private bits.  Unless you've got a petite torso, I do NOT recommend this."
2.0,"I learned the hard way that Stetson hats run a size or two bigger than most other hats.  Normally a Large hat is for a 22 5/8&#34; to 23&#34; in diameter.  A Large Stetson is 23 - 23.4&#34;.  If you normally wear a Large, order a Medium, which is 22.2 - 22.6&#34;.  Plus, who uses a decimal when referring to inches?  Quick . . . how big is 22.2 inches?  I had to learn this lesson the hard way.  Not only did I have to pay the return postage to get a refund, but also 20% of it as a restocking fee.  All I wanted was a good looking hat that fits."
2.0,"They are really cute, but my daughter is 12 months and the 6-12 month size will not stay on her feet.  They are way too large. By the time they fit her, it will be snowing in Ohio."
2.0,The lens is cracked it’s behind the frame but makes the lens sit funny
2.0,"The material is great. It feels really good, quality robe but I'm going to exchange for a larger size. The length is great but the sleeves were really short on me. I'm short and the medium was too small."
2.0,"Plastic on hat arrived dirty and scratched, unsure of quality but item looks unappealing and dirty."
2.0,I don’t know if they would be good for walking but when you run your phone falls out of the pocket. The liner is thin and doesnt chafe but not useful for actually holding anything
2.0,Loved the shirt but it was way to wide and long for me
2.0,Not sure why the questions about my sunglasses refer to shoes?
2.0,The elastic was just a little larger then expected but my biggest problem was the fact there was way to much extra fabric. I recommend ordering at least 1 size smaller then you normally wear. Unless it was stretched to it's extent it looked like I had a diaper on.  Otherwise really beautiful.
2.0,"Let me start by clearing one thing up... This is 100% without a doubt a long sleeve shirt, and in no way are these 3/4 sleeves.<br />As far as long sleeve shirts go, I can tell you it's very soft, and more of a sateen feel.  It's sheer, but not paper thin... it's like 2-ply fabric.  If that even makes sense.  It's suuuuuuper long.  Way too long for me.  I am 5'7&#34;, 36A, 138lb, and this shirt came down to the bottom of my butt.  I could've taken a picture of myself wearing it without pants on, and you wouldn't see a bit of my bits.<br />There's no way to cram that much material in your pants and be comfortable... so this shirt doesn't work for me.<br />But - if you're looking for a nice, soft, extra long shirt with long sleeves - this is the shirt for you!!"
2.0,"Soft inside but narrow fingers, tight fit. Returned."
2.0,Ok sports bra lasted about 3 months
2.0,I could not wear this underwear with a panty liner or pad. It would not properly stay in place. Unfortunate because other than that they fit great.
2.0,"I am giving this 2 stars because the sizing is inaccurate. I am a 36A which by their guide is a medium, the fit was great except the cup size was enormous.  I was also suprised at how nice the quality was. I will be exchanging them for a small and will update my review once it is received.  I  really want to like these bras :)"
2.0,"it is tight, if I ordered 7 insted of 6.5 it could be better, the ziber is not move at the ankle"
2.0,Fit as expected. The material was not what I anticipated. Seems like it's made more for a costume rather than for real flamenco dancing.
2.0,Had to send back.
2.0,It didn’t really fit as expected very lose fitting and the style wasn’t what was shown
2.0,$3.50 ok value just take care of it my 2yr old granddaughter easily broke it
2.0,Fabric is terrible. So so small. Short short as well.
2.0,Three fit odd.Not enough material in the back yet more in the front. Not for big girls at all.
2.0,"Size is so hard to determine with this shirt, I wouldn't even bother. Based on reviews, I went up. What I got was way WAY too big for me. It was ridiculous. The shirt came from Asia, so I'm not even going to bother trying to send it back. I hope I can find a giant who likes flannel. The shirt is very soft and well made, though."
2.0,"I bought this jacket to go with an outfit for a wedding and I was disappointed.  I wear a size 6 in US and bought the large and it fit like a small.  Additionally, the product came with a horrible odor attached. I am returning to get a refund."
2.0,I ordered 2 of these they sent me one. The hearts don't fit on the pandora bracelet. The color is somewhat faded and just got it. I would not recommend.
2.0,"This fabric muffles my voice more than others.  Also, when the fabric stretches it reveal white fabric/spaces where the tye dye isn’t printed and looks strange.  Ok in a pinch but not my day to day mask"
2.0,Print/ pattern is cute but runs really small
2.0,I ordered the ones in the photo. It took several weeks to get them and I didn't get the ones in the photo I received a bore plainer pair.
2.0,WAS TOO SMALL.....I GOT THE BIGGEST SIZE THEY HAD TO OFFER AND IT WAS STILL TO SMALL
2.0,"I wanted to love this top. It is pretty,  but poorly made :( Had to return."
2.0,"They were suppose to be round, They are teardrop oval shape"
2.0,"Bought these slippers Nov. 3, 2015. Cute. I would buy them a size smaller if you buy them. Dec. 3, 2015, just trash. No shape to them, got way too big."
2.0,Thought these would work for my overalls. They were the wrong ones. Didn’t realize until I opened them and saw they wouldn’t work.
2.0,Wore down after first use
2.0,Way too big for my baby.
2.0,These are nice masks but you can't mold the nose piece as there is no metal piece or bendable plastic piece in the nose area. So really isn't a good mask - they just look nice.
2.0,"Were fine for the summer, but eventually the sole detached from the upper part of the shoe and I had to throw them away. I got my money's worth out of them!"
2.0,Ordered a large when I normally wear a medium and it was still too small. I suggest ordering 2 sizes up.
2.0,Looks cheap and fits small.
2.0,It did not fit perfectly.  It was a bit loose on the shoulders.  The material is nice though.
2.0,"I'll start with the positive.  The company that makes this ""Mask"" is responsive and communicates quickly.  I thought I'd like this as a Pandemic Protection Mask better than the traditional type because it would be easier to pull up and push down as needed.  This way it could just hang around my neck like a scarf until I needed to put the mask in place.  This part is true.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the material of the mask is just not breathable. It clings to your face, not giving enough space to take a breath, made worse by the carbon filter smashed against your nose and mouth.  Plus, the filter doesn't fit into the mask all that well, despite it being so close to your face, somehow the filter keeps wanting to slip out.<br /><br />The other issue was it took over a month for the product to arrive.  The delivery date was originally a week and then it just kept being pushed back again and again.  I don't blame the company, with all that was and is going on with the pandemic, it's hard to control things like delivery and customs and such, but it was still frustrating.<br /><br />I had to purchase a traditional mask while waiting for this one to arrive, and now that it has, I still wear the traditional one due to the problems I described above.  I now keep this one in the glove compartment of my car as an emergency backup."
2.0,Poor design. Could have sewn a small elastic ban to the back. Would have been better. Plus for some reason the shoes smell like ramen. The smell turned my stomach. But my daughter doesn't seem to mind so we will keep them. But I do not recommend this product
2.0,These run really small. Not happy! I got these for our Disney trip ;(
2.0,"I'm recovering from a broken shoulder and this bra is extremely comfortable, but that's all I can say for it. In no way does it provide enough support for sports. The pads are thick and hard and clearly show through the ""flesh-colored"" fabric, which is actually a kind of bright cantaloupe color. I'm keeping it because I need something right now that has a front closure, but I won't be ordering more because I can wear it only under tops that are not see-through. When my shoulder heals I'll be looking for a more discreet bra that provides a more natural look."
2.0,the ring diameter is to grate to fit key hole.waste money
2.0,"Watch out for new sock sizing rules. Hanes changed the label so what used to be regular-sized women's socks are now considered &#34;extended size&#34;. I ordered these &#34;9-11&#34; socks, but that doesn't seem to exist anymore. I was sent socks which are now labeled on the package &#34;shoe size 5-9&#34; and they are too small for me, (I wear 8 1/2). Hanes now labels normal-sized socks &#34;extended size&#34; (shoe size 8-12).  Make sure to check the &#34;size chart&#34; if you're size 8 and up, and order from a better dealer who is aware of this change and won't just willy-nilly mail out small socks.."
2.0,"The socks are not the same size. One fits just fine, but the other is noticeably smaller."
2.0,"I like the style of the blouse and it fits fine but before I know it, the collar front feels like it's choking me. I'm constantly pulling the front of the shirt down, so instead of the comfortable free-flowing feel, it's a constant tug-of-war:("
2.0,Returned; didn’t like appearance.
2.0,"When these came I was excited. However, the foot holes were completely stuck together and even though I carefully cut them apart they still began to unravel immediately."
2.0,Shirt is shorter than shown
2.0,The stitching along the top is pretty weak. It lasted me less than 4 months before it started coming out.
2.0,"This shirt was a size too big. I am normally a medium; however, this fit like a xl."
2.0,overwhelming chemical smell. Had to return.
2.0,"These were lovely earrings.  The clasp, however, is extraordinarily weak.  I received them as a gift and within two hours one of them had fallen off who knows where.  Put your money on better constructed earrings."
2.0,"This is a cute dress - flattering and its got pockets, but the purples are completely different. And not in a cool, contrasting sort of way, in a this-fabric-is-what-we-have-left-whatever-its-purple sort of way."
2.0,The stencils were great but the glue included in this pack was completely dry so unless you purchase some separately this will be completely useless to you.
2.0,Weak clip. Bought 2 pair and inner clips came loose and got stepped on. Now have 1 pair
2.0,Did not fit true to size. Material is cheap.
2.0,TThey run on the small side so they didn't fit to comforably. The soles are really thin and provide no protection what so ever!
2.0,The hem on the pants aren't great. Just a little cheap looking. It's okay I guess
2.0,Arms really long and hip size too small
2.0,"These glasses actually would've looked pretty awesome with the exception that one of the lenses looked like it was slightly curved into the frame, as opposed to rounded. It's hard to explain but it didn't look right because one lens was different from the other.  Due to this, I am going to return."
2.0,"I was expecting a coin department, but there was none.  It is mostly for credit cards, etc."
2.0,It fit nice but it looked like a night gown
2.0,"Poorly made. You get what you pay for though. Within the first 20 minutes of having it on, my year and a half year old ripped the bow right out of the middle part. I had to resew it myself. But, generally, it was very cute on him."
2.0,I was disappointed to receive one of the cufflinks broken.  I had anticipated them very much for an American themed party and I was unable to wear them and purchase another pair to receive in time.  Had to return for a refund!
2.0,"The screws popped out after a couple of uses, now I can't use it anymore."
2.0,Baggy in the front and has a thick elastic at the waist that is really tight. Maybe for someone who doesn't have much of a butt the fit might we better.
2.0,It’s silly to even consider this to be an adult size.  Petite small at best.  Short arms and the “tail” hits at mid-back.  Very cheaply made. 2 stars simply for the fact that our 2 year old loves playing with it.
2.0,When these showed up I literally thought they sent me the wrong color ... because they are so clear. I only gave it two stars because the case they come in is nice.
2.0,"I have worn the pink ring for a few days and noticed the stone was gone,. oh well."
2.0,"This is a cute charm but is NOT the one from the picture. I purchased this as a gift for a pineapple lover. The one listed 2 tone, silver & gold. When it arrived it’s silver with green crystals at the top in place of the gold. It’s cute but not what I ordered"
2.0,Pay attention to their sizing. The xl is really only a usa size 8. I'm only 5'3 and it was very short on me. It fit me like a child's t-shirt. Very disappointed.
2.0,I ordered these socks per my husband's shoe size and they were way too small for him.
2.0,"Honestly, I was so disappointed with this dress. The stitches were coming out immediately before I even put it on. Crappy craftsmanship. I'm not returning it as I can fix it myself, but I was really not pleased."
2.0,The white is see through and not flattering at all.
2.0,"I LOVE the overall fit but the thumb holes (which is why I bought it) are on the complete opposite side of the sleeve. It's ridiculous! Great color, but the point was to keep my hands warmer and my sleeves creep up because I can't use the thumb holes. And yes, everyone that see's it comments.  Grrrrrrrrrrr"
2.0,I got it for my daughter and though it’s cute and she loved it. It’s very flimsy. The chain broke when she took it off but thats what ya get for the price.
2.0,The material was too thick for my liking. Too warm to wear with humidity.
2.0,The fabric was stiff and didn't iron well.
2.0,liked the price not a fan of the quality
2.0,"Thick and inconvenient...looks like it is not as was advertised, shipped another item.."
2.0,The material of this shirt was cheap and there were loose threads hanging out. It was not sewn together smoothly either. It kind of bunched together where the fabrics met.
2.0,"I could see this potentially working out for someone a lot taller, but this skirt just didn't have enough shape or structure for me (I'm short)"
2.0,Arm holes are huge - had to alter it so I could wear it.
2.0,Too tight and too short
2.0,I take size 12 shoes and these were supposed to be for size 12.  They are toooo big!!
2.0,If the ends of your glasses ear piece is thick.  It tears through the rubber.  Good on thinner designs of glasses.
2.0,There are two very odd pleats that sit right above the breast that made the whole shirt lay weird. This is now a sleep/house shirt.
2.0,"I wanted to love these sandals, they have a good grip rubber soles and the faux suade and pinstripe lining is adorable. However my sons toe kept coming out of the side staps and I wish the straps were a bit more snug, they allow too much room and are too long so the toes end up sticking out of the shoes. Otherwise good quality."
2.0,"The yellow over the stomach area comes flat, it’s not like in the picture. I wish i knew that. That’s the only reason I bought it."
2.0,My daughter loves these - when they work. It's difficult to get the lights to not change as she walks. And the battery only lasts about three hours on a full charge.
2.0,There is a whitish substance between the openings of the design. Other than that pretty much what to expect for the price
2.0,"I normally wear an 8. I chose to buy the 8 1/2 because it is a slip-on and also I have a high instep. The shoe slipped on well, but my toes were at the end of the shoe."
2.0,"Returning, somehow is too lose and too long. I am 5'1 110lbs. the length were in my ankles. Other than that, dress is beautiful."
2.0,I have locs. A little over my shoulders. This cap was looser than expected or wanted. I wanted something tighter around that wouldn't come off in my sleep. I can toss and turn too much. Also it bleeds on your pillow. I continuously have black stains on my pillows. They are worse when I oil my scalp but this cap definitely bleeds onto my pillow.
2.0,It’s too loose around the neck. Fits everywhere else but when you tie it up the neck is all loose and saggy
2.0,"The ítem received was in perfect conditions. The only trouble is that I paid for a polarized sport glasses in yellow & black color BUT I received a pair of polarized sport glasses in Tortoise & Brown color. The Tortoise & Brown color is quite different from the Yellow & Black ones, so I feel very disappointed with my purchase."
2.0,The tutu and headband are two different kinds of blue... my daughter still wore the skirt but had to search around fit a headband to match
2.0,It is so tight across my face. I feel like I am being smothered. Will not wear unless I have to. I do not recommend this product.
2.0,"This watch was only $10 so I didn't expect an incredible watch for the price. However, the incredible number of five star reviews led me to believe that this watch was at least close to waterproof for things like showering, swimming, etc. Yet within a month of getting this watch and wearing it everyday the plastic casing of the watch has already cracked next to one of the buttons which causes water to get in whenever I get it wet. Ironically despite the watch being filled with moisture it still continue to function normally and eventually dries out. Overall, meh. 3/5"
2.0,"This shirt looks cute and put together in the pictures but when you put it on the middle completely opens because its not sewn, I'd highly reccomend lots of safety pins to keep this shirt closed. I bought it for vacation without trying it on and now it's too late to return, I would skip out on this one"
2.0,Cheaply made. Don't fit well. But they're super cute.
2.0,"Not bad, though the dangling jewel looks and feels quite cheep. It broke off after a couple of uses."
2.0,The pins holding the band into the face broke after just a few weeks of wearing it. Very disappointed with the quality!
2.0,"I ordered based off of the recommendations on the size chart. A XXXL would have been more appropriate, and I'm 5'1'', and weigh 124. This shirt is short and much too snug."
2.0,Enormous.
2.0,Okay fit for lounging around the house but they are too tight around the glutes when active.
2.0,"I purchased this, and the color is way off from what it says it is.  It's periwinkle, so be sure you like it.  The suit is too small so buy a size up if you are curvy. Also returns are a nightmare.  It is costing me more to ship the suit back than it did to buy it in the first place.  Also, as a note the supplier is quite unresponsive and I had to file a claim with amazon to get the supplier to respond. Don't buy from this supplier unless you are SURE of the size."
2.0,It has a horrible smell Inside
2.0,Too small amd material very thin and cheap looking
2.0,I have had this watch for maybe two weeks tops and the brown divers dial around the crystal fell off somewhere and now the edge of the crystal is exposed. I don't want to wear it in the shower because of this and now I am going to have to return it or send it for repair. Not happy!!!!
2.0,Does not fit as picture implies.
2.0,"Its color is pretty, material is also too good. Am 5' 7&#34; and weighing 152 lbs and ordered a size M. It was my worst decision. Size S would have fit me better. I tried returning this to the seller, who gave me an option of accepting 30% of the price since shipping back and forth would have incurred unnecessary expenses. I got 3$ back from dealer since I spent 11$ on this top. And it is lying in the corner of my cupboard! *Sigh*"
2.0,"made cheaply, don't waste your time. very hard to get on chicken. elastic too tight."
2.0,"Very clunky and heavy, the fit bit does not look very good inside the bracelet, the backing is very difficult to get off."
2.0,"the string is bigger then the hole. Spent few minutes on it. Finally I decided to give up. Giving 2 star because I like the color of hat, And the hat can be change to 2 color, black or brown. But still, I purchase this hat is for protection, Not recommended."
2.0,I sent it back.  The bottoms were great but the top was too padded and awkward.
2.0,"Hard to adjust while on your head. Good it was a three pack, threw first one away because it stuck and wouldn't slide"
2.0,"I read the reviews and this did not match up as others described. Length was good but the shoulders were way too wide, made it look super awkward.<br />I’m 5’ 4” 140 and got a Medium."
2.0,It’s thin material.
2.0,It is very pretty... however my center blue stone was attached crooked so it is raised up on one side and you can DEFINITELY tell! On the plus side ti took about 2 weeks to get here ... exactly when they said it would arrive.
2.0,One of the bumpers had a hole upon opening and the other bumper could not be blown up. The nozzle was not attached properly to the bumper to blow it up.
2.0,"This bag is very nice, it has three separate pockets and it’s perfect for holding your makeup or toiletries. The only problem we had with this bag is that we thought that we would be getting 4 bags instead of one, in the photo it shows 4 bags and considering the price it seemed reasonable. It didn’t let us choose a color so we thought it would give us all 4 patterns. The bag is really pretty and very great quality but it wasn’t what we expected for 34$"
2.0,Wouldn’t wear to anywhere important. It’s shaped odd. Only using it for surgery.
2.0,They are comfortable however they did not last me longer than a couple months. I have socks much older than these expensive pairs and have never had the same problem.
2.0,"After reading other reviews I bought the 7xl (16 US) so it'd fit around my chest and I'm glad I did. Fabric is soft and seems a good thick quality. However I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in the length!  From the picures it totally seemed like it'd be long enough to wear with leggings and it's not even close. I'll keep it to wear with jeans, but still disappointed by pictures and description."
2.0,I wear a 2x and I got a 4x so it would be super loose. It's almost fitted. 😳
2.0,Very tiny stones.  Not what I expected from the picture.
2.0,Cheap. Strap started unraveling a few days after I got it.
2.0,Very disappointed in these earrings. Not what I expected and the back of one earring keeps opening up and the earring keeps falling out of my ear.
2.0,"I am 5'3&#34;, 110 lbs and the small is enormous on me! It is so wide at the top. And this is not just below the knee, its maxi length. I had much better look with the Joy Envyland dress. I will be sending this one back."
2.0,This skirt is NOT full or flowy. It's more straight down and doesn't have enough fabric to look like the one in the photos. I'm disappointed but I got it cheap so it's not worth it to send it back.
2.0,"These are impossible pants. I might have messed up the EU conversion, but these are like a 36&#34; waist that comes up to my chest. No human could fit these."
2.0,The quality of the fabric is more on the cheap side.
2.0,fit was not as pictured. leg did not taper as shown
2.0,Too tight. But a lot of coverage
2.0,"Too small and tough to breathe in for my 4yr old. Also, school will not allow them."
2.0,The pants are good but the hooded sweatshirt is too short and the neck is too tight.  The hoodie isnt very stretchy and its definitely not flattering.
2.0,"The color and style are completely different from the picture. I ordered the green and what I got looks just what another reviewer post. The material is soft and on me it’s long enough for leggings, so I’m keeping it. It’s more like a comfy T-shirt but a little longer and with the band across the bottom."
2.0,Nice compact backgammon set but magnets are very weak.
2.0,A piece was broke when it arrived and it is made out of very cheap material. Feels like something I could have bought from a dollar store.
2.0,I know I didn't pay that much for it but it has already turned color and is now copper looking. I bought a gold chain to wear with it but the color difference is to great so I won't be wearing it with that chain.
2.0,"I was disappointed with the quality Material I bought the white and it’s see through the top is a little big on me the bottom fits great, did not like the material…"
2.0,This dress does not fit as pictured. It was so tight and I ordered up a size. Also the front seam line is uneven and one side is super short.
2.0,I have ordered several dresses with the cute in image. However this is NOT the dress in image the bust line is super high and fits like a bag. Not flattering and NOT the same cut as in photos. I will order the proper dress from another amazon store and be returning this knock off. So disappointing i thought i would save a few dollars with this store but clearly it was not worth it.<br />Nothing worse than a store recreating a dress and not doing it right. thank you for wasting my time<br /><br />(do not ask me to revise I will not)
2.0,"They looked so lovely, buuut, they fell apart. So I incorporated them into my art. At least they have a new lease on life. It’s a shame really. I wanted to wear them..."
2.0,Runs very small and took forever to ship.
2.0,This top looks like it would be a tri-blend breathable tank - looks super cute in the picture but not in person.<br />Fabric 80% Polyester 20% Cotton<br />It's almost like a dri-fit type top.
2.0,Cute but not as advertised.  Kilt is labeled S (not medium) and is only 19 inches long.
2.0,"Love how it looks but not stretchy at all, very tight and you can clearly see your underwear"
2.0,Way too thin for military style boots. It's cheap Chinese stuff don't buy.
2.0,product does not explain tength  it is too short and as such i must buy a new watch band
2.0,They fall off
2.0,my daughter was never really able to walk in these and was tripping herself up often.  He would take them  off all the time.
2.0,"The shirt I got was NOT 3/4 length, it is FULL length sleeve.  But it was cheap and fairly comfortable, so rather than return it I'll just keep it for the winter."
2.0,"The quality seems nice enough, but this is too small to hold more than two credit cards."
2.0,Fits nicely and is a good product over all but I only received one while this is listed as a two pack. Pretty disappointing.
2.0,well and good
2.0,I liked the color and the texture of the material but the crotch was a couple inches low and made it poochie in the front.
2.0,You can barely see what it is. So small.
2.0,These are nice looking shades and the price was great but they broke after two weeks. I would not buy again nor recommend. Spend a few extra bucks to get something not so cheap.
2.0,"One of the fitting brackets on the bottom row broke off on the first day. They have been pushing my gums down from the grill on my bottom row. The upper fangs are causing my lips to bleed, over all not the best product."
2.0,"Looks nice, like the style but the strap broke off the first time I used it. Disappointed..."
2.0,Smaller than expected. Fabric thin. Neck line is very modest.
2.0,Ordered a size larger than I usually wear and still small. And as one purchaser commented it did have a strange ordor. I had to air it out before I could wear them
2.0,"The second time my son wore these, the lace snapped. We tied it and he still wears them, but I had hoped they'd last a little longer."
2.0,"Giving this a 2 star rating because it is very cute and the fabric is nice, the shipping was a lot faster than expected, but it is way to short in the torso and there is no support for the girls. As far as the shortness goes, I'm 5'1&#34; and I got the XL and it was still to short and because of the it also affected (what littlethere is) the support for the girls. So basically is your very tiny, short, and not so well endowed in the chest, it would probably fit you."
2.0,"This bra has hard, well firm, cups like bras from really cheap stores. It looks much better than it fits. It is cut very low in the center, making it easier to avoid uni-boob. This would be a good bra for a low cut top when you want to avoid having your nipples show through."
2.0,My dress was torn in the lace on the shoulder. Very un happy that it came that way
2.0,So disappointed. It runs at least 2 sizes too small. It also has really poor construction: threads hanging & seams opening (before I even tried it on).
2.0,Nothing like the picture. No sequins or sparkles. I got a large and it’s tight but stretches. It didn’t cost that much so that’s good. Colors don’t look like the picture either. Disappointed
2.0,It's not warm in a real cold day. Not worth at this kind of price. No difference from the $10 one.
2.0,"I liked this dress, but had to return it because it was too small and really short"
2.0,"The fabric felt weird, and the shirt was super short."
2.0,"Loose on child’s head, easily falls off"
2.0,"Poor wrist band, terrible light"
2.0,"I have teeshirts with thicker material than these!  I will not buy again.  But if really thin is what you are looking for, I can say that they do seem well enough made; and I did like the waistband."
2.0,Purchased these and sized up and still too small
2.0,"Although the scarf is gauzy and lightweight and looks very nice, it is too flimsy. The fabric catches on anything that may be sticking out and pulls the threads out. I only wore it a couple times and already the material is &#34;running&#34; (like a stocking). I ordered the gray and it has purple undertones so isn't a very nice gray. I don't see this scarf lasting the season."
2.0,they dont stay on very well.
2.0,Cheap material with poor stitching. Arms weren't long enough and it looks nice only in picture. I had to return it.
2.0,This dress is for maternity . Cheap material too
2.0,I was sad because the one I bought in blue fits great. I bought 2 in this color and they are huge. Sent one back. Will clip the other with bobby pins.
2.0,"So very disappointed.  Should give just one star.  The bottom drip pan does not fit on, so in spite of it being very pretty, it is non functional.  I will find some use for it as yard art."
2.0,"I don’t consider my wrists large, maybe standard size. However, these bands are too small to slide over them. Unless I overlooked a size choice when ordering  (I checked, but didn’t see one) be cautious and maybe look elsewhere for a product more descriptive of a sizing chart."
2.0,These shoes look cute and are easy to put and the price is great since my kid tears through or out grows shoes quickly.  The problem is something in the material of the sole of the shoe makes these shoes stink like crazy.  After only a couple of wears they've become unwearable for this reason.  I don't think my kid has particularly sweaty or stinky feet since other shoes are just fine.
2.0,The material was not what I thought it was going to be like. I returned it.
2.0,Very cute. Looked just like the picture. Clasp was broken upon arrival.
2.0,These were too small even after sizing up two sizes.
2.0,"Falls apart easily, the battery spinner pops off the ring. If dropped pieces fly everywhere. The ones that make it through falling apart are cute with blinking colored lights and the spinner."
2.0,"I was shopping specifically for loose-fitting, long length hoodies, this one came up in the results so I bought it because I thought the design was very cool. When it arrived, it barely reached the line of my pants. I was looking for something that hangs at least as low as the bottom of my pockets to provide solid concealment. This hoodie would have been great if the fit was what I was looking for. Aside from the length, it fit me as I expected - 5'10"", 225 lbs, average body proportions."
2.0,"This is an ok-ish sweatshirt. It looks just like the photos and the sizing is accurate. But the fabric started pilling after the first wash, the sweatshirt itself has zero stretch, and maybe it’s just me but the arms are wayyyy too short. Cute, yes. Would I buy again, nope."
2.0,Zero stretch to this shirt. Washed and hung to dry and it shrunk up to a size 2T. Just don’t.
2.0,"This product still takes considerable effort to ""separate"" and thread through the hole.  I don't feel there's much difference between this and regular key rings."
2.0,The top is too short length and the description stated “true to size fit”. Well it wasn’t. I will be returning the item.
2.0,Very cheap and stems bend
2.0,"I ordered this in a size 6 for my almost 4 year old. It is waaaaay too big. Also, I ordered the robe in red, but the robe we received is hot pink. I’m still giving it two stars bc it is soft and cute and has pockets."
2.0,Loved the look and feel of the watch but the strap broke in less than a month! It wasn't even used for every day wear and when worn it was in an office environment so nothing crazy was going on to break the band. I know you get what you pay for but still... Disappointed.
2.0,"This hat is not adjustable, it stretches but not comfortable, and looks small on everyones head that tried it on, not a good buy..."
2.0,I didn't like the sleeves. Returned.
2.0,"Eh didn't really do anything for my ps4 pro, lifted it up a bit but over all was kinda unnecessary, didn't help airflow or anything. If you're having fan issues best thing is to open it up, clean it out and get the fan attachments for it. Or upgrade to a ps5..."
2.0,"I ordered the Yellowish-Brown top because it was the color t-shirt I liked the most and had a cute concert outfit planned with it. THEN I received a cactus brown shirt instead, in the YB packaging. Returned and ordered a second one to see if it was just a minor mistake and got cactus brown AGAIN and haven't gotten the replacement that was ordered. Seller was no help either as I was really looking forward to the yellowish brown oversize T. I will give them that the shirt is oversized and soft. Just totally wrong color than ordered."
2.0,"It's very nice, but the chain broke the first time my wife wore it.  I see many others with similar comments in their reviews.  I ended up returning it and would avoid buying this."
2.0,This is basically a shirt with a sticker ironed on. You can actually see the lines of the sticker. Not worth the money.
2.0,"The waist was extremely small, but everywhere else was fine.. usually it's the opposite for me. I'm 5'6"" and around 125, return started. It sucks because it was very soft and comfy in the legs"
2.0,"i ordered medium because the reviews said it runs small, but i usually wear an xs/s that is why im returning it. surpisingly the top part fit me but the bottom was loose. i ordered another one in a size small and ill see how that goes. also, i only like the top, the bottom wasn't cute or anything. if there was an option to get just the top i'd do that."
2.0,Oh boy where to begin.  First off the chain to this is just plain pathetic.  It's really small.  It won't fit around your neck you have to unhook the really bad clasp which really isn't a clasp at all.  You have to bend it to get it in there.  Also the one they sent me has very very little blue in it at all like they show here in the picture.  The little stones are more dirty crystal looking.  If I saw a picture of this there is no way I would have baught it it is very very cheap and falsely advertised to look GOOD.  The one in the picture has a nice blue color to it but not the one I got.  A very unsatisfying purchase.
2.0,nice dress but only good for slim curve-less girls
2.0,"I really like the lens and frame, but the ?rubberized inner brow pad? is poor.  Most of the gluepoints have come unglued, and I am tossed with going back to Campmore for warranty, paying $25 to have them replaced by Native, directly, or just removing the rubber brow and keeping them as is."
2.0,Snow removal of my driveway. Very unhappy. They got soaking wet and my hands were very cold
2.0,"not a fan of the material or style, it's a square piece of super wrinkly material folded in half, and the sides are actually completely open except for a small attachment point to make a &#34;sleeve&#34; area- not a caftan style as i thought, and you can actually see this in the pictures model's arms are extended outward. the light blue is more a green color. i was thinking the model was tall & this would be longer on my 5'2&#34; self, but the model is likely petite also because it fit similarly. though the width would fit an XL girl, the length would not likely cover a very long torso."
2.0,Looks more like a scarf than a wrap around!  Color is true to picture.
2.0,The sizing instructions are off - I had to re-order another ring in a smaller size. The center ring is very pretty but the surrounding rinds do not stay in place. Lucky it's cheap and my daughter can play with it! ;)
2.0,"This is such a cute printed bikini, but the fit was awful. The bottom fit okay, but the top was incredibly tight and awkward. I don't have a large chest at all, but this was way too tight. I'd probably need to go up 2 sizes. Also, the quality of the stitching wasn't great. Cheaply made."
2.0,"Did the trick for the first coat of epoxy flooring. However, they fell apart while applying the second coat. Had to fish out nuts from wet silver metallic epoxy....."
2.0,I really like the look of these especially the butterfly one but it turns my skin green so I'm not very happy with it. I had a butterfly one for a long time that I bought at a shop on vacation in FL but it got too tarnished and I found this one which looks almost identical. I was happy to find one so similar but I'm disappointed it's not better quality. Never had that problem with the one I bought in FL. I guess I'll be looking for a different one to buy soon.
2.0,"Not very good quality,started changing color within two days"
2.0,"I gotta 12 should've got 13  was too tight too .I sent them back, so buy larger."
2.0,runs very small. for someone short and petite. Picture speaks louder than words. Nice jumpsuits if it comes in your size.
2.0,I bought it for my 7 year old daughter and within 15 minutes the clasp fell off and now its worthless.
2.0,I wore these for kickboxing class. Usually high waist compression pants work great for high energy classes. Not these. They constantly roll down. I detest workout close that require constant adjustment. These would serve much better as walking pants.
2.0,Looks really nice but the fit was very off.
2.0,Small in size  good quality material
2.0,Poor quality. Skirt too tight for a chubby baby.
2.0,If you are trying to cover your face you will have a hard time keeping it on and also hard time breathing. It goes up your nose every time you breath in.
2.0,"The packaging it comes in is amazing!  The lenses are cheap.  If they put as much money into the lenses as they did the packaging, these would be a 5 star purchase.  Frames are decent.  They don’t entirely fit my head, but I’m a giant fat hog, so they should fit a normal head."
2.0,"Looks cheap,You get what you Pay for."
2.0,"The description of these handkerchiefs were ""multipurpose bandana print cotton scarf headband handkerchiefs"" but they're simply just a handkerchief. They're small, so even if you wanted to wear them as a scarf or headband you'd have to have a small head or a thin neck. I'm currently in the middle of crafting a shadow box that showcases antique handkerchiefs that my grandmother owned, so these are essentially going to be filler. The designs are nice, and the fabric feels like cotton, though a bit rough. The finishing stitches on the scalloped edges, though, are a bit sloppy. Some of the fabric is puckered here and there, and even more so some of the stitching seems to have put a hole in the thin fabric. If your intention was to use these in your day to day, I'm sorry to say that these aren't entirely the ticket for you. Multipurpose if you're dressing a child or a doll, but not much else."
2.0,"I love the Inca I recovery flip flops, and I have 2 pair that I wear exclusively in the house. I was very hopeful the the slippers would add the arch support that is need in the cooler months. I was very disappointed when they stretched and did kit have any support"
2.0,Waist was too small
2.0,quality fabric but sizing is a little difficult to match
2.0,"I am 5'8 and expected this to be longer, it hits at a strange length... oversized everywhere else in an unflattering way.. material is too thick"
2.0,Width of frame extremely small.
2.0,let me start of with saying this dress is beautiful and well made. HOWEVER it runs EXTREMELY small. The large which is supposed to be a size 6. would probably fit a size 2 at most a 4. So if you are within that size go ahead and buy it but if you are a true 6 then this will not fit well. especially if you are curvy.
2.0,Handle ripped off after using it for little over a month.
2.0,"It amazes me that in ordering two the same garments, in the same size with the color being the only difference, how one can be too large and the other too small."
2.0,You get just enough for one good spray
2.0,"Came in a nice box with a pretty cloth ribbon and I was initially happy to find  14K white gold earrings at this price point.  Unfortunately they arrived with a pearl loose in the box (it had fallen off the hinge where it ""dangles"" during shipping)--bad sign for quality control all ready!! Tried to put it back on  the hinge and it was quite difficult.  Also,  the metal was sharp and pretty flimsy & bendable, but I eventually succeeded in fixing it-- for now. Still, I am worried it will fall off when wearing and I'd lose it so I'm returning.  All in all not satisfied with quality--expected more for the price. Guess you get what you pay for?"
2.0,Fell apart after the second day.
2.0,"This is not what I was expecting.  It does not lay flat under another top.  It actually makes you look 2 sizes bigger!  Plus, it moves around when you sit down and has to be constantly readjusted.  Waste of money for me."
2.0,I ordered a large and when it came it for more like an xtra small.
2.0,"I didn’t like too much about it, very thin material not flattering"
2.0,"Horrible material, not breathable at all."
2.0,I would give it 4/5 starts if it didn’t come apart once I went to adjust the fit. The back adjuster comes off.
2.0,It made my skin brake out and it ended up bruising.
2.0,I honestly didn't try them on because they appeared so sheer!
2.0,"I gave this Mask a 2 star ..and I will explain why. I love the concept , the design and overall shape of this mask. I had wanted one that was similar to a Fox and my mouth wasnt covered. I love the led lights and how their are 3 different modes (stay on ,slow flash and quick blink) however regardless of it saying that it may be a different color light then as pictured it was only purple (which I'm happy with ) what i am not happy with is the fact that i opened this mask and there are Mark's in it ,pencil scribbles and other random Nick's. Perhaps a bit of quality control would go a long was especially for a mask at this price. I will have to fix it myself as I do not have time to ship back to the seller. There is also no padding inside of the mask for your face and the elastic band is VERY thin.. like stuff you would use to make a kids necklace or something of the sort. I love the concept of this mask and what it could be ..i feel as if a little more care and time and definitely quality control it could be a 5 star product!"
2.0,Not what I thought I was buying. Way to small
2.0,Not what I expected...cheaply made...
2.0,I measured my daughter's foot before buying these shoes. It still was way too large! Disappointed.
2.0,"These slippers are comfortable but, the Velcro did not hold up on the second day of wear I had to sew down the flap to make the Velcro stay it should have been extended a little further down. After sewing it, it fits better. Don't think i would purchase again"
2.0,"No way to select a letter at checkout. Thought there was options as the images show several letter options. Came with only ""M"". Should update description to reflect the letter that will ship with the anklet."
2.0,Had to return them super small
2.0,"It's a basic long sweater. Not a duster; it falls a bit below the knee. Quality of the material is just OK - it's not particularly soft, and definitely not expensive looking. I'm not a fan of the cuffs - would prefer a straight line or flare instead of a cuff that's smaller than the sleeve above it, but I may be able to stretch/block it to where I want it. I wouldn't really recommend this at the current price ($45ish); it's more of a $30 sweater. But I do like the color - a true rich cream (buttercream really)."
2.0,adorable boots. seemed tight on. the liner was very soft but had a hole in the toe. it moved around too much also and seemed to take up too much space. otherwise would have loved to have kept them. always buy kamik every year with the  growing feet in our house.
2.0,Weird fit. Decent quality
2.0,Parece q salieran en una piñata. Demasiado simples.
2.0,My nephew doesn't like Polyester so I will return it.
2.0,Super cute design. But definitely not squat proof. I tried a small and a medium thinking a larger size might help but it didn’t.
2.0,"I would have loooved it sweater if it had been longer in the front. I generally like the high/low look, but this was too much."
2.0,Okay product. My son wore them for a weekend at the pool and there was a lot of breakdown in the fabric at the toes.
2.0,Cute dress and my daughter loves it. However the quality is so poor that the straps for the belt broke within a couple of hours of wear. But my daughter loves it and I can’t get it off of her to return!
2.0,Charm was very pretty but fell apart while attaching it to my bag. Really!
2.0,"There was no inscription on the inside as described.  This was a mothers day gift for my mom, I was disappointed."
2.0,"It is a quality piece of equipment and not expensive enough to be worth returning for a refund, but the clasp is too small to fit over my belt loop, so I won't be using it."
2.0,This top is way too small must b made for skinny ppl
2.0,Pros-<br />I really like the color of the canvas (I ordered the gray)<br />It’s an attractive smaller carry-on bag with convenient exterior pockets.<br />Straps seem well constructed.<br />Cons-<br />It would be nice if it had interior pockets which is not a deal breaker -<br />The worst part about this bag is the zipper. The zipper broke after very light use and the bag was not over-packed. Evidently the zipper was not properly seated at the base and came apart from the teeth on one side during use.
2.0,They were too small to wear. Even when I ordered a size up.
2.0,I received it today. I wasn't impressed. It isn't made very well. And it's not exactly a waist trainer. It's more of a back brace. I should have just bought one of those.
2.0,"Purchased a XXL which should have fit and was way to small, more like a medium."
2.0,Very small and does not match the necklace
2.0,Did not look good
2.0,This isn’t as great as I thought it was going to be from all the reviews I read. It’s ok. It’s a large band so will stick out on sides of your finger- it’s thick. Fits snug- I would order a half size bigger than usual
2.0,"I thought it was going to be a beautiful watch, but once I took off all the plastic wrapping around it, I realized it looks very cheap and I'm sure one can't return it without all the wrapping. Also the clasp is very difficult to use to take off the watch. Love my other Breda watch but this one does not live up to its quality."
2.0,"Shipment to took a long time and I received a faulty suit. The top was missing two metal clasps therefor it couldn't be worn. Good material, pretty color (cyan) and customer service was helpful with making things right."
2.0,not very good quality either
2.0,"Very nice, comfortable, but to short for me. Makesa good top.  Things also fall out of pockets, but I can live with that"
2.0,"These earrings are super cute and I really wanted to love them. Unfortunately, they are really heavy and the post is quite thick. Putting them in was uncomfortable."
2.0,"Idk how many stars to give ( i had no choice but to choose ), the color and the material were very nice the cut however was off. I had to return it"
2.0,While I was in love with this watch band when I first got it after only three days of wear the entire pattern started peeling off to reveal a white Apple Watch band underneath. I was so sad because I absolutely loved this watch band but now it’s found it’s way to the trash. The watch band is still a good band but the peeling of the pattern was horrible.
2.0,It could be made a bit bigger and def sewn better! This is almost water resistant..with that being said it is better than being sopping wet after dishes so it is decent. I am just upset it broke on me after 3 weeks the neck loop just fell apart.
2.0,I am 5'3&#34; and the blouse covers my thighs.  Very long but good for a very tall person.  I don't want to take the time to return it.  I will pay for it and give it to someone who can wear it.  Thank you.
2.0,Metal clasp broke the first time I used it.
2.0,Great fit but a little bit see through. Also there were little holes in the back that will have to be mended.
2.0,"Not bad for the price. Came with a flaw in the scarf, some random white yarn strand sewn in but popping out."
2.0,Wore it for a week. The seems for the outer and inner lining started to fall apart. Guess it was good for a week...
2.0,"Very cute but an XL isn't an XL in the USA, no matter what the size chart says."
2.0,"Don't really like it, I'm using it as a nightshirt minus the necklace. Cheaply made. Not flattering."
2.0,Very unusual shape and it would be nearly impossible to wear like the model
2.0,"Although the ring was very sparkley and pretty, the pictures, in my opinion, do not show an accurate discriprion of what the ring really looks like. This ring is made to sit underneath a larger center stone. It's dips down to sit underneath. I was under the impression from the photos that it came up like an arch. Anyway, if what you're looking for is a ring that sits under the center stone, it's very nice for the price. If you're looking for a band to sit flush with your ring, do not buy."
2.0,"Just ok. The bodice is a different fabric and slightly off color, making it difficult to match the yellow."
2.0,"Washing once in the washing machine is like an old garment.  It seems to have been worn many, many times.  Very exaggerated"
2.0,Adorable! I love the design and saying but it came discolored. Part of the word muffled and the whole right side of the book are a brown tarnished color and polishing with a cloth does not make it silver again.
2.0,"The seam of the shirt is in the front. I didn't notice this, but it's not incredibly flattering. Very cheap and scratchy fabric."
2.0,"Will repurpose them...Cannot wear these huge, ridiculous looking earrings. If they were smaller, maybe."
2.0,"The fabric is thin and as a result, slightly see through which is a peeve of mine. I only wear it as a nightgown."
2.0,"These glasses are made for petite women.  If you have a smaller face, they are perfect.  Do not bother if you have a larger face."
2.0,"I wear a size 10-12 and ordered by the chart guide, and when it came it would fit a size 2-4 person.  Very disappointed.  Sell by true size or don't sell it at all."
2.0,A bit too small for a full grown male sadly
2.0,"It fits comfortably, however color was as n important factor in making the purchase and that was very off. Description and picture shows orange however the color was coral! Big difference!"
2.0,I wish if I can like this dress! But the mesh sheer is very heavy material that makes the dress less flowing!  The sizes are off too big and too long even when you wear high heels! Some flowers are stitched and some are glued.  The dress color in the picture more like sliver and dark green but the one I received is more like white and light lime green Color.  See pictures.
2.0,&#34;Pearls&#34; are peeling and &#34;silver&#34; is tarnishing/ flaking off
2.0,I loved the look of these hand warmers but they just didn’t hold up.  The first time I wore them I got a hole near the thumb which I mended because I loved them so much.  Just about every time I’ve worn them some kind of new hole appears.  I’m surprised because I have quite a lot of products from Smart Wool.
2.0,Mask did not look quite like the photo on Amazon. Quality was less than expected. Hair fell out. Paint/makeup on mask looked cheap. No mouth hole so talking is difficult and you cannot drink/eat anything without removal.  The mask fit almost as tight as my own skin skin. Nose holes are small and breathing was difficult.  Would not recommend
2.0,Sizing is misleading.
2.0,I do not like the wires sticking out obnoxiously behind your head!
2.0,Cheap quality I gave it away.
2.0,Doesn't fit like the photo. It's to short and loose toward the end of the dress in the back!
2.0,"So, I have several pairs of these leggings in other colors and I absolutely love them!!! When I received this black pair however, I was extremely disappointed - the material was not as soft, it felt about as thick but they were completely see through, the fit was not as supportive in the stomach area, and the stitching was incomplete in the crotch which led to a hole (see photo) the first time I wore them. Since I haven’t had any issues with my other 4 pairs though, I’m going to consider this a freak mishap, and I still plan to purchase other colors and recommend them to friends. A friend of mine ordered a black pair in a different size just before I received mine and hers are totally fine... seems to be a manufacturing quality control issue!"
2.0,No we're near the size on it.
2.0,I really loved this jumpsuit and it did me well on four 8+ hour flights. But it completely fell apart the third time I washed it.
2.0,Ugh! Just opened today to get ready for my daughters school tomorrow and the wing elastic is broken! Easy fix for me- but frustrating non the less
2.0,Fits weird in the underarms
2.0,Looks better on the model!
2.0,these are so soft and seem to be great quality but they run so comically large that I can't comment on the fit. for reference I usually fall between a small and a medium depending on fit/brand/style/etc. I purchased a medium but id need an XS which I don't think exists. 3/10
2.0,love the fabric but was not the style pictured but sent back -
2.0,The sleeves were to short and the length of the body was too short. The body of the shirt is fine. They need an extra long or tall version. My husband is 6ft and 200 lbs.
2.0,"The Amazon review system forces you to choose &#34;somewhat large&#34; or &#34;fit as expected&#34;, etc., but in reality, this swimsuit just did not fit well - too large in the hips, and cut wrong in the top. It did not look attractive at all and as my wife said - it was very 80's. I think that if you had a VERY specific body type, it might look good."
2.0,Is only a size 9 that came.<br />Needed 8.5.<br />Too big<br />Non returnable item
2.0,Much shorter than expected . Bought for my dad and looks like he's preparing for a flood
2.0,"Very disappointed that the band I received is very different in color than what I ordered. The color is not gold, it’s more like a rose hued tan."
2.0,"If the outside temp is 20 degrees F or less, these are not warm enough.<br />The battery did not last long on high.  Maybe 1-2 hours."
2.0,This thing is a beast
2.0,Not what I expected- sleeves are very tight down the forearm
2.0,Super cute. The top fits great. It has ties so you can tie to adjust the fit. The bottom I could fit two kids in. I have to pull out the sewing machine on this one or my daughter will never be able to wear it. It would cost more to ship back than it did to buy and it took about 3 weeks to receive. The summer would be over before we got it back. If this fit it would for sure be a 5 star.
2.0,"I am very disappointed.  I bought this mainly for dog training, but also had hopes of using at work (I'm a police officer).  However, only about 1/3rd of the videos I tried recording even came out.  The others either were not there or would not play on the computer.  Of those that did record and play, they were all cut-off after a minute or two as the glasses turned themselves off.  Apparently they don't like motion, as one time they turned on by themselves while sitting in the car, and I had 40 minutes video of my dashboard.  Yet anytime I am moving, even at just a walk, they turn off after just a minute or two.  When the video did record, it was decent video - good picture and sound and looking where I wanted them to, which makes it even more disappointing that it won't record most of the time, and cuts itself off when it does record.  I sent them back for a refund, which of course, with Amazon, was easy."
2.0,Impacts 🔊 audio; muffles both incoming & outgoing
2.0,Zipper sticks and hard to close or open
2.0,"These were way too big. They where larger than a dime. They are very pretty and I liked the roughness of them, but to large to wear so I returned them."
2.0,"I am not sure what layer of the lens is wearing off, but I'm guessing it's polarized layer.  At the base of one of the lenses you can see a layer wearing off.  I've had them for a couple weeks and it is getting worse.  You can't feel anything on either side of the lens, so I think it might be some kind of layer within the lens that is wearing away.  Either way, definitely not something that you would expect."
2.0,My son wanted this for his gf and it looks good in the picture but the fabric is awful. Feels like it would come apart if you washed it. We both said &#34;send it back!&#34; Two stars because the design is nice. Otherwise it would be one star. Also she is little but this looked small even for her.
2.0,not crazy on the silver color
2.0,"I bought 4 of these scarves in different patterns.  They look like the photo, but are a synthetic satin weave.  Silk is a material that can come in many different weaves: chiffon, plain weave, twill, or satin but it is a monofilament made by silk worms.  ""Silky"" of ""Silk like"" is a feeling from a satin weave fabric that can be made from any material.  Most people don't know the difference between ""silk"" and ""silky""  The ways to tell the difference, is in the washing.  Silk wrinkles badly when washed, and absorbs water.  Synthetics repel water and hang dry almost wrinkle free.  If you burn a synthetic, it will curl and melt, like a plastic.  If you burn silk, it will burn smoothly and not curl or become hard, and it will smell like burning hair.  These scarves are beautiful, but they are NOT made of Silk."
2.0,Run large; extra fabric in running shoes. Soft but quite thick.
2.0,This did not look good on me and it is also sweater/sweat shirt material.
2.0,"While this band is better than the stock band that comes with the Samsung watch, it gets funky relatively quick.  Additionaly, the metal bits rusted and I've now disposed of the band.  It wasn't expensive, so not a huge deal but would have liked it to last longer."
2.0,"I love the variety. But one of the pairs I liked the most, came with the main stone missing. The other pair I really like had the main stone fall out after the second day I wore them."
2.0,I got these for my granddaughter on 10/14. It is now 11/18. The toes have holes in them and the sole is separating from the upper boot. I sprayed them with waterproofing but they still leak on wet days. I knew they wouldn't hold up but was hoping they would last longer than they did. The style is so cute and she absolutely loves them. It's such a shame. I'd be willing to pay more for boots made of real suede but can't find them in this style. Also I ordered them in a smooth finish in hopes they would last longer but was sent the cloth ones. A very disappointing purchase.
2.0,I ordered a large based on others reviews and it is closer to a small. In addition to the small size the slots on the sides go up pretty high offering very little coverage.
2.0,Cup is small.
2.0,Runs small! My daughter is a 9 and these are 9/10.... they won’t fit for long. Not a great value for the money!!!!
2.0,"I loved this bracelet and got tons of compliments on it, but the metal started discoloring right away and it broke in just over a year of owning it. Disappointing."
2.0,The lanyard I received had blue string not gold as advertised. Beads looked plastic and not as nice as advertised
2.0,I am returning to Amazon is darker then picture.
2.0,"Although I adored this sweater at first, it falls apart SO easily!!! My favorite sweater is now a pile of string...."
2.0,Thought this was cute because I’ve bought other Jack Smith skirts. Disappointed doesn’t fit anything like the other ones I have. I’m five for 108 pounds it was too tight and way too short not made as nice as the others that I have bought with the plates in the back sending it back disappointed.
2.0,chino
2.0,I usually wear a size large and they fit snug. Very see through and the material is like thin silk so makes you sweat. I would order up a size since the material is thin any stretch you are able to see your underwear.
2.0,Earrings are beautiful BUT earring backs were totally bent when I received them. Supplier did a terrible job packaging them. Attached photo shows the earring post AFTER I spent some time trying to straighten it. The bends make wearing the earrings painful.
2.0,Saw this dress on Venus for $39.99 this summer then found it on Amazon for $9.00! I was so excited about my find but the dress did not fit well. The top looked like a balloon on me. Too much material up top. Thought it was going to be a really cute dress
2.0,"Ugh, really wanted to like this...as others have mentioned, way too short on the sides and back and is see-through. A slight bend down and you can see all my goodies.. the arms also awkwardly fit and are a bit short. The color isn't as vibrant as shown in the pic. Definitely not worth the nearly $40 I spent. Returning."
2.0,Loved the bag but it ripped shortly after we purchased:(
2.0,The bag needs a ziper
2.0,Such nice material but way too big for my 3 year old which ended up frustrating her
2.0,The pictures make the hook look like it is small but in reality it is very big and wide. If you have a small hole this hook will be to big it starts out at about1/4 inch and in the middle of the hook it is about5/8 so take this into consideration wen ordering
2.0,I was not happy with this watch band. It was difficult for me to put on my small wrist and very stiff . This made it uncomfortable. I had to find a different band to use and put out more money
2.0,Disappointed<br />Cheaply made<br />Poor fit
2.0,"The dress fit as expected and is cute. However, I ordered red and the primary color on the dress was a pale orange. It did not look anything like the model under the color I picked."
2.0,Fabric is ugly and like a cheap nightgown which is the only thing this Dress may be suited for.
2.0,Son bought it for his teenage girlfriend. It's &#34;okay&#34; / cute but costume jewelry. Fine for teens and they loved it.
2.0,I ordered a medium and these are like an extra small. The waist could fit one of my legs. And it doesn’t have a lot of stretch. The color is very pretty and the fabric is very nice but I would order up a few sizes if you want it to be comfortable at all. Medium is my usual size and I can fit in about a 6/8 in most pants so I don’t know where they’re getting that this is a medium.
2.0,Fabric not so good
2.0,"My son needed a plain white shirt for his Christmas play and this shirt seemed like a no brainer. But after washing it (which I do with all new clothing items) the shirt seemed abnormally small. The first photo is the shirt laid atop a 5T shirt. The second photo it’s laid over my younger son’s 2T shirt. Since I’ve washed them I can’t return them, but the sizing is completely off."
2.0,came apart in 2 month
2.0,"This was good for the wind, definitely not waterproof. I wore this in the rain and my layer of clothes beneath the jacket got soaked."
2.0,Loved the delicate smaller size but broke after 2 weeks with careful wear.
2.0,"this dress is nice but it is for someone flat chested, anything above a B cup and you are exposed"
2.0,Band broke and is unrepairable after only 2 weeks of normal use.
2.0,This is a nice shirt but runs super small...thank goodNess they sent a Size up from what i ordered because otherwise I'd send them back
2.0,"This is very easy to put on and looks fabulous!! I’m gonna stone her but she cute as is too :p<br /><br />UPDATE: wore her a couple times and I have to say, fabric rips easily, seams are not sewn well and some areas are not hemmed well... not really worth the price to be honest..."
2.0,"I definitely liked this dress and was pleasantly surprise that the fabric was more swearterish than expected, but it was still too small, will purchase again when the fall begins in a larger size."
2.0,The color on the straps is coming off.
2.0,Most are very flimsy. Should say in description the gauge. Smaller gauge than needed.
2.0,CHEAP!!! Fell apart the very same day shipped
2.0,"Yo normalmente soy talla 1XL,  recientemente tuve mi bebé y con la cuarentena sentí que aumente mucho peso, decidí comprar la XXL y se me cae, corren grandes."
2.0,"These would have been great if the manufacturer used different connectors.  They are colorful, sturdy, and well-made lanyards. BUT I am returning them, because the rubber connectors used to hold the eyeglasses are so thick and harsh against the skull. I found myself yanking off my glasses after only a few minutes' wear because the connectors were so annoying.  PASS."
2.0,Not at all like the picture!<br />very disappointed. I have ordered with this company before and was very satisfied.
2.0,The dress itself is fine but it's very short for a maxi dress. I am 5'7&#34; and it hits a few inches above my ankle. Looks awkward on me. Would be better for a shorter person. Returning.
2.0,The jumper itself is very cute. The material is costumey to me. Straps don’t always stay tied. All in all decent for the $$
2.0,The material is beginning to rip in a short time.
2.0,"I didn't like these at first, because it was winter and my feet were cold. However, for a thin dress sock, they had all gone through the wash 3 times (hung-dried and then no heat ""fluff"" dryer cycle) without losing their shape, and still felt the same. I'd decided they'd be a nice ""spring"" sock. (This is the winter with 3-4 awful snow/ice storms, and now it's warmed up considerably for March. #Winter2021).<br /><br />But I put a pair on yesterday and it had a big (dime-sized) hole on the top part of the foot. It hadn't snagged, and the material didn't look particularly ""worn"" — I can't explain it. So they were good for 3 weeks/washes (6 pairs), but that big, unsnagged hole for a sock I wasn't that happy with for ""wool warmth"" with thin material, no thanks. I'm definitely taking them out of my shopping cart. I can get socks in a grocery store that are thicker, and I'm not fond of them either, but they go more than 3 washes. Any ""wear"" on cheap socks is usually from a seam or the elastic, or at least on the bottom of the sock. Inexcusable."
2.0,"Runs small. Need to size up<br />I haven’t washed yet, but your feet are full of the fuzzy lining."
2.0,I wear size S/M. I ordered L and it was way too small.
2.0,I can still feel the cold air when being outside for longer than 5mins and theses are not waterproof
2.0,"Ok.  But would not purchase again.  Fit is ok, but vest is bulky."
2.0,Cheap and very difficult to put on eye glasses that have the larger lobe at the ends.  Mine separated where the nylon part attaches into the rubber part.  I would not order again and still have unused ones and will give to a guy I don’t care for.
2.0,"Materiel seems to be decent, but I wouldn't count on it holding up for a long time. I'm mostly concerned that when you select it, it does say &#34;White(as a Set)&#34; however it is only the one piece."
2.0,Not impressed. Very thin and the fit is not flattering as the picture shows.  The bottom of the shirt is tight and the top is cut very open  I am a  D-cup and it was loose on top and cut so low that half of the bra was showing and the cutting is straight so it fits to loose up top and to tight on the bottom.
2.0,"Material is pretty with vibrant colors. But the cut is all wrong for anyone over a size small.  It’s got a huge amount of material and is like wearing a tent. Its very unflattering if you’ve got anything to fill the tent, if you know what I mean."
2.0,Doesn't look as nice in person. Purchased it for my teenage daughter. She is usually a small. Followed the chart and it is to big. When wet it hangs off of her. These are supposed to fit really secure. I suggest going down a size. Cheap material. So when it hugs the body it is almost see through.
2.0,Weirdly made and shaped. It does have pockets tho
2.0,"These are cheap, mass produced earrings. The label on this pair stated &#34;made in china&#34; and the label on the second paid stated &#34;made in USA.&#34; Disappointed, as these were to be gifts for my nieces."
2.0,"These are great glasses, lightweight in spite of the rim and are very nice-looking.<br />However unfortunately clipping these on to any a pair of glasses is a hassle the likes of which I haven't endured before. At the end of this exercise there are smudges all over my glasses as well as the clip-ons. This sort of defeats the purpose of the clip-ons if it takes me ages to clip them on..."
2.0,The slipped off my hair really easily. I had to return them.
2.0,"Pretty, but turns fingers green within the hour of first use."
2.0,Color faded and was not true to size.
2.0,"Disappointing, returned.  This top is much shorter than pictured, unless my torso is the length of a giraffe neck.  It’s quite thin and just didn’t look or feel right through chest and shoulders. Maybe it’s a “summer hoodie” for those of you who like to wear long sleeves and hoods with your shorts and slides."
2.0,"Beautiful shoes. However, they run small and are uncomfortable."
2.0,It is a bit short front to back. I use it but keep checking it is still on.
2.0,"I don't know if it was my height or my weight distribution (5'5, 140 lbs, short-limbed, athletic build) but these looked ridiculous. I was so excited about having looser flowy pants for work-they were roomy and comfy but I have no idea how you'd style them. The sash/tie that came with them was not worth using."
2.0,"I’m giving 2 stars because they are not for me. I really wanted to like these. They are very nice looking and seem to be made well.  They seem very comfortable but there is not enough room to tighten the straps. They are very loose. If a friend doesn’t want them, I will be sending them back."
2.0,Runs smaller than stated size.
2.0,I am disappointed with the quality of these. They are also very difficult to adjust the Velcro strap.
2.0,"The colors of this shirt are nice, however it is very wrinkly and after washing becomes and an even more wrinkled mess.  The cut is unflattering and frumpy."
2.0,"They sent me a xxxx LG and it's still tight on me, this is for Asians only not American size they say they fit but they don't, buyer beware"
2.0,Very cheap fabric. Cute but nothing as shown.
2.0,not clear lenses
2.0,"I liked that it arrived on time.  However, I must return.  It was full of lint balls, and look as if it had been worn.  It was more burgundy or wine than red.  Nothing like what I was looking for.  Back to the drawing board."
2.0,"These are made with good quality materials and very cute, but they don't stay on my toddlers feet which makes them dangerous."
2.0,"The dress is very delicate. It is also sized too small. It is very pretty, though."
2.0,Three different XLarge Jack Smith sweaters. Two fit fine but this one has to be returned because it is too small.
2.0,"I gave his two stars because I like the colors and the style. As for the fabric it is cheap, doesn't hold its shape and is poorly constructed. I returned them."
2.0,A great looking top that is too small. 😏
2.0,Fell apart way to quickly.  Very dissapointed.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:8cde39e948b16ffe6fd4324819f0a246]] It was a really cute idea until I put it on.. my husband bought these for us and after one day my moon girl is missing.. The ring wasn’t closed all the way when I opened and tried to tighten it but no luck.. so now all I have is a magnet with a cute bracelet 😑
2.0,The zipper broke on mine as well after two weeks of usage. And beware: this bag is bigger than you think. Cool looking though...
2.0,"I ordered this leotard for my daughter's first dance recital. She wears a size 4T most of the time unless the sizes run big. I got the size 4-6 and it was a little big but I would consider something this item something that runs small for it to be a size  4-6. I really wasn't crazy about how it looked on style wise, the fabric is more nylon than cotton, and the color is more peach than the typical ballet pick so it didn't end up matching her tutu very well. I ended up buying something else at the last minute."
2.0,"Heck?! The top fits fine. The bottom I could barely get on, and even if I could, you'd see my hoo ha. Not to the size chart at all. I ordered the XL and the skirt could fit my 7-year-old. Absolutely ridiculous."
2.0,"its shout card holders . or maybe it me,i just need more room for cards and picture space is smaller for pictures"
2.0,Don't by they won't last long
2.0,"Returned because it was on the smaller size, and didn't like the fit.  Not very flattering.  Easy return!"
2.0,Waist was too small/tight for my 29&#34; waist. It technically fit but was not comfortable.
2.0,The bolt provided is too long for it to hold 3 keys like shown in the product photos. Otherwise the airtag is held securely and the loctite is nice addition.
2.0,"It is cute, but fogs up glasses and is hard to breath through after a short period of time."
2.0,"Out of all 3 pants, only the blue one fit me, the other 2 were too small..."
2.0,Earrings are nice but the necklace was short and something was missing
2.0,"The fabric is much too thin. The color was drab, did not match the photo at all.  Comfy as a nightshirt, but I wouldn't wear in public."
2.0,"Cute, but I ended up returning it.  It was too baggy in the top, and too long.  I'm 5'4&#34;"
2.0,The earrings would be nice for a little girl (around 2-3 years old). They are far too small for an adult woman.
2.0,Said it will fit 40mm but it won't..  im disappointed.. what a waste. Gave 2 atleast.. coz bands seems ok..
2.0,Super cute but way too heavy!
2.0,too large nd colour is not even same its bigger than the size they show
2.0,Cute design but see through.  Returned.
2.0,"Pants are just okay but for the price I expected more.... They look casual and dressy.<br />Order correct size...had to be shortened an inch...<br />I'm 5' 4""... 1st pair fit good... 2nd pair is tight.. could have gotten for the same price ...retail !"
2.0,They were small.
2.0,"Shipping took months, and product was very large and really does not fit any one in our home , Cute designs though"
2.0,Small fit on top for women with larger than a B cup
2.0,The trouser is not what I really expect am sorry
2.0,It looks like a guys shirt. It’s to big and it doesn’t flatter unless you use it as pajama shirt
2.0,Came torn. The stitching was all raveled out.
2.0,It's difficult to give an accurate rating when they come 2 sizes too small
2.0,"Outfit is WAY too big. I would just keep it for later, but the onesie is covered in light brown stains. Returning."
2.0,"I thought this would be great for our flower girl and it was, until the necklace broke before she had a chance to wear it.  It looked good, but it is cheaply made."
2.0,"Too late to return. If you purchase them, try them on when you get them. I didn't and now I'm stuck with them. The same sizes can vary up to 2 inches on the waist line. One pair might fit well, while the next one is too big or small."
2.0,"if your expecting the same quality as in the picture for the design, then ur not getting it. the shirt in itself is a good t-shirt quality though. just disappointed with the design"
2.0,"I like them.I where a 8 in shoes,got a m7-8 and fit grate. not a slipper to where all day long.  Not as comfortable as I thought"
2.0,Liked how it looked but it had a hole in one of the pockets & seems like the threads are coming out so it’s a bit of low quality
2.0,"After a few weeks of use, the fabric has begun to fray around the notch that I tighten it to.  Additionally, the rings to secure the end of the strap are very intrusive when using a keyboard."
2.0,small than actual size.
2.0,"I ordered two pairs of the black gradient, and each one had a cracked lens.  Fairly cheap plastic, but what can you expect for $5?"
2.0,It is itchy and feels like cheap pjs
2.0,"Went by the size guide but shirt was way too loose. The blue was lighter and duller than I expected. Fabric felt decent, but it wasn't something I could ever wear"
2.0,"Returned, not white"
2.0,Straps are too short for me. If you have broad shoulders this might not fit so well. Got a small way too tonight. Medium didn’t fit quite right for me.
2.0,"I ordered a D cup since I'm a 42 C and it absolutely was more suited to a B.. possibly even an A. I don't think even a DD would have worked much better. Company should review its size chart for sure! I gave it ⭐️⭐️ since the quality of the product was actually good, the sizing however is atrocious."
2.0,It fits a little snug in the arms and it's not the color that I ordered and it came a week late I'm not happy with it but I'm keeping it
2.0,face too big  band too long
2.0,"In theory this dress is cute. It fit well on top and through the waist and hips, but it was MUCH shorter than in the photos. I am a little under 5’4”, and it came well enough above my knees that I had to be extremely cautious when bending slightly over.<br /><br />The fabric really is the most disappointing aspect, however. The top was a knit not unlike long underwear or raglan tee. It stretched oddly throughout the day and just ended up looking wrinkled and baggy in the arms by the end of the day. The skirt looked a bit dull on arrival, and after the first wash looked ancient. I couldn’t even see wearing it a second time in public due to the worn look of it. I wish I had returned it in time."
2.0,The headpiece is beautiful except that one of the beaded medallions is missing.
2.0,"Floppy and it won't hold it's shape, also strong plastic smell"
2.0,It's ok. I wished it was smaller.
2.0,The color purple was a really light purple like lavender. I was really hoping for the dark purple as seen in this picture.
2.0,I ordered 3 of these because they were so cheap they fit as expected but the bottom part is really long and baggy so it makes it look like your just wearing a moo moo... fabric is nice soft not see through but I would only wear this for pj
2.0,Returned.  It was tighter than expected even though I ordered a size up but so long it came down to my ankles.  Even with the scrunching it just didn't look right.
2.0,This is not good quality at all.  Would not suggest
2.0,This shirt is definitely in the OK category.  It is not as unique as in the photo.
2.0,Just okay. The tie is sort of misplaced on the collar. Not sure what to do with it?
2.0,The card slots are too tight so I find myself putting them in the cash slot... and they occasionally fall out when removing the wallet from my pocket. Also its flimsy and a bit large. I paid 24.99 but I feel like I could pick up a wallet that I like just as well from Walmart for half the price.  The one positive aspect is that I've been using it daily for about 7 months and it still looks as new as the day I purchased it.
2.0,The product is exactly what I wanted looks wise.  The clasp are very hard to use whether opening or closing. Seems like it should be oiled (not possible).
2.0,"Cheaply made, low quality fabric. It fits ok, but it looks very cheap."
2.0,I usually love quay sunglasses but when these came they were bent outta shape a bit and one of the arms seems like it will break at any given moment.  They are extremely flimsy. Gave two stars because of fast delivery and I love the colors in the lenses.
2.0,Really heavy pieces used in a hijab
2.0,"I bought these because of the price. I should have known better. Granted, the boots are comfy for the 1st week. But the soles of this boot are way way to soft.  The bottoms really had no traction to begin with, then the boot had No traction, as in bald.  I was slipping around on everything. Honestly,  I would not recommend these boots to anyone."
2.0,"The gem, magnet, and then finally today the whole half heart broke off. Within days."
2.0,"The top is great, and it is modest. The bottom is waaaaay too cheeky for me."
2.0,"I have the other brand of Irish sweater , thought I would try this one. Not worth the money. It does not look like pictures it is a much looser knit. It is so loose on the sleeve it looks like holes thinking of sending back."
2.0,I was disappointed. It was lose and kinda stiff. The sewing and finishing were tacky and it's not as sexy as in the photo.
2.0,Very cheap looking watch I won't even wear it and larger than it looks in the picture
2.0,4/7 of these are cute but they are most definitely NOT surgical steel. False advertising. Turned brassy and not wearable in only 2 weeks. Surgical steel should never change color.
2.0,I was very disappointed in the quality of the suit. It is extremely thin the pants really need to be lined or thicker. I could actually see my son's legs through the fabric.
2.0,"cute, but the hole that the post goes into is offcenter and I had to bend the post to gef it in, which means it sits funny in my ear now. not worth the money."
2.0,"Grip is very slippery with a little sweat. Also, be careful when slipping the grip on, it caused some major blisters when I install it. See picture."
2.0,Dresses are cute and fit great. Only problem was the white dress was coming apart at the top inside and I had to sew it.
2.0,fit super weird... i got a large bc i’m like a DDD but it was gappy and strange! i couldn’t have sized down bc the sleeves were TINY<br />maybe if you have a smaller chest/more petite it could work? idk man
2.0,Muy ancho y no tiene amortiguacion
2.0,Can’t read the analog time.Was going to return it But was out of the country for 2 months and missed the end time
2.0,"The dress is pretty , but the style is a bit different than pictured . It is shorter and runs smaller in size . The sleeves are quite large as well ."
2.0,"Cute, but not good on performance. Also, it's kind of a hassle to fasten. This belt is for looks only."
2.0,"Very cute when dry, but when the top gets wet you can see the ring of the pads on the chest area.  Not flattering at all for my teen. We had to go to target and get her a different top."
2.0,Arrived broken but I was able to fix it. Otherwise cute.
2.0,they broke. poor material.
2.0,they do not work very well.
2.0,"Nothing like the picture. The top of the dress is cute and great material, but the bottom is very cheap and wrinkled. The dress is two different colors"
2.0,This mask is for looks only
2.0,Definitely order 1 or 2 sizes up if you like a looser fit.
2.0,"Started accumulating water under the face the first day I got it. Still works, but it always has water droplets and is therefore blurry."
2.0,"Runs large. I'm 5'2&#34;, 135lbs, and a 36C. The 10 was too big under the arms and very loose through the bodice. I love the floral print and cut of the dress as modeled, but the stock photo is a bit misleading. I'd exchange it for an 8 if not for the quality of the dress itself. The material felt cheap and is quite stiff. FYI: It's 100% polyester. The skirt creases very easily and flairs out awkwardly. The &#34;woven chiffon&#34; bodice is well-done, though. No stray threads!"
2.0,Don't waste your time buying this product. I can't get the face to hold its shape it keeps the cheeks dented in. I won't bother sending it back. I will hang it in a tree by my front door to scary the trick or treated. They'll probably just laugh at it. Troward the end of the night I'll throw it in one of the older kids bag. Hopefully you won't notice and when he gets home and takes it out of his bag you'll have nightmares that night with any luck.
2.0,I ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP BUYING BC THEY BREAK SO EASILY AND SO SOON.<br />SORRY.
2.0,"I'm not thrilled with this snowsuit.  I purchased it after seeing the great reviews, but once it came it looks cheaply made and flimsy.  It wouldn't stand up to MN winters, just a little poly fill rather than anything warm.  I'm trying to return it but returns aren't free - it's going to cost half the price of the suit to return it."
2.0,"The zippers on these are cheap garbage. They come apart easily, get stuck, etc."
2.0,"So, I love the color and feel of these leggings, but unfortunately that’s about it. I ordered a size medium as I didn’t want them to be too small/tight when working out and the medium was quite a bit larger than I was anticipating—but initially I thought no big deal—until the inner seam ripped. The fabric was not taut so I’m not sure why they ripped. :("
2.0,Very thin fabric no inner layer to add additional filters and seems to offer little protection as per CDC guidelines of 3 layers. Made in China which is fine for me but could be misleading as name says Jasmine USA.
2.0,"Huge - barley fits my adult face, covers my 5 and 7yr olds entire face"
2.0,"I ordered a medium based on mixed reviews of size.  I normally wear a medium.  5'5&#34; 145 lbs.  This shirt was more snug in my waist area than I cared.  The material is lightweight.  I want to return but evidently I pay for return shipping.  Be sure to check where your shirt will come from.  Not all colors are free returns. As for colors, I first thought I ordered two of the same shirts.  However, I got a black and a navy.  They are very close in color and need bright light to determine which is black and which is navy."
2.0,"They are pretty but unfortunately I even could not put them on, may be my ears are not appropriate for them"
2.0,"The glasses broke within a few days right on the nose connector. I suggest looking for better quality but they look good, feel okay on the face, protect from flying shards. When I dropped them they scratched."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:16085eaadbdf11b53b3ffeaa13e60f22]] Honestly not worth it if you are plus size. I ordered the largest size. I normally wear a 3XL and this fits like an XL. it’s stretchy so it’s definitely shows everything. It’s mildly see through. It’s shorter than I expected as well. Selves are longer than expected too. Personally not worth it. I will be returning mine.
2.0,"The color, style, and price were great.  The fit is too small in the toes.  And I have a narrow foot."
2.0,"I ordered this product as it was described as an A-line mid length skirt. It turned out to be a mermaid style, long skirt. Not at all what I was looking for! If you get the right style and the material is the same, the sequins and rose gold color were at least pretty! I just wish it was the skirt I wanted and ordered."
2.0,I loved the style but I am a 38D  & it makes my boobs  look flat. Which sucks! If you are a B cup it will probably fit fine.
2.0,Loved this purse cute and sturdy however now that it is wearing some green is now the color the purse is turning as they must of painted it black dark green coming through all over
2.0,"This dress was a sad story for me. I ordered two, the green and red (first two pictures) and was amazed and thrilled that I might have found my dream summer dress. they were so flattering through the bodice, had the perfect length skirt, and the fabric is nice and breezy. I did have to stitch up the top where the haps between buttons are because I don't have the -A cups that the models do. Those first 2 dresses were exactly as pictured and I was so happy I decided to order more in different patterns. That's where things started to go downhill. Apparently I lucked out with the first two because none of the other dresses I ordered had remotely the same pattern. instead of the nicely tailored bodice, longer sleeves, and a ruffled skirt, they have a much cheaper design of a single cut of fabric with a simple elastic around the waist with much shorter sleeves. This in and of itself could be a cute dress, it's just A. Not what is pictured and B. Not the same as the other original dresses. I have seriously tried ordering every single print of this dress to see if any other ones were the actual original cute design. No luck at all. So I'm happy with the first two but the rest were such a disappointment!"
2.0,"It runs small, sizes are not accurate, bought it in 3 different sizes and none fit well"
2.0,"I have worn a handful of time, the electric button hiker has ripped and the fabric is piling already. The"
2.0,Cheaply made and necklace was beyond cheap!!!!!!
2.0,I bought this item as a Christmas stocking stuffer but was disappointed at its' small size and cheap appearance.
2.0,"These are cheaply made. I feel like the earring post will turn quickly. The thread is cheap, but you received a lot for your money. You can always replace the stud with something better quality from the craft store."
2.0,"This doesn’t stretch at all! I bought it one size bigger for both me and my partner and both were too tight!! It was really uncomfortable to sit and it was too late for us to get a bigger size. If you want this to fit comfortable, I will recommend to buy it two sizes bigger. Also is really cheap material, felt like it was going to rip at any moment."
2.0,Ordered the size I needed according to the sizing chart .<br /><br /> Once they arrive I tried them on they were too small
2.0,I bought these because I thought the inside was Taupe not beige. They were very cheap so I was not expecting much from the memory foam but they are very thin as mentioned in other reviews. They are otherwise warm and pretty.
2.0,"Style not as expected, shorter. Had to return. Quality was decent for the price, just wasn't for me."
2.0,Runs very small. I am a 6-8 and ordered an XL and it's snug. The material and construction is good.
2.0,Too small. I returned it.
2.0,"Granted the ring received is the one in the picture. However, with the additional pictures showing 3 rings and the description mentioning ""rings"" leads consumers to think that they are purchasing multiple rings. 2 stars for a deceptive add"
2.0,This is the longest retainer I've ever tried on. It was impossible to flip up for work. The color was pretty but the shape & size just weren't what I was looking for.
2.0,I love the design of this sports bra...it worked very well and fit snug as I prefer.  But after one use the stiching on one side came undone.  That speaks to poor  workmanship.<br /><br />I have bought several sports bras from this brand but this style needs some tweaking in the sizing and workmanship.
2.0,Sizes  run way small
2.0,Cheap looking.  Won’t be giving this as a gift as I planned.<br /><br />Don’t waste your money.
2.0,Super cute but the graphic on the front is stiff and sticks together after washing it. I got a refund but I wish it was softer.:-(
2.0,"I bought this with the intention of using it for Halloween, but unfortunately it was already falling apart when I opened the box. All of the roses had already fallen off, which was disappointing"
2.0,"Top was too big, bottoms were just right."
2.0,Cute but very thin and not quality. Won’t hold up. Buttons already loose. Wouldn’t recommend .
2.0,"Considering the length of the curve, it makes it very painful it put in...had to go back to a straighter stud..."
2.0,"Read the description, and not the title.  These are in no way CREW cut socks.  They are spandex-y and knee high.  If you are a man, these are NOT for you!  Additionally, once they are on your foot, the material and pattern stretches and fades out."
2.0,Just didn't fit me! Not a bad product.
2.0,The outside of the wallet is sturdy but the inside zipper area where you keep change torn up after one week. I have coins floating around in the wallet now. If the stitching wouldn't have broke I would have given it an additional star.
2.0,"So, I bought this shirt initially from the options that is blue with white stripes on the sleeves. Based on reviews, I bought it in a ""Medium"" since it sounded like it ran large.<br />Fit perfect, generous as mediums go and good length and not too fitted around the tummy.<br /><br />So happy with my purchase was I that I got online and ordered another one- this would be the green shirt with the black stripes.<br /><br />Apparently there is NO consistency in the sizing (or else no quality control).  As soon as I pulled it out, I was convinced it was a ""Small"".<br />It's about 1"" shorter than the other one, snug around the stomach (not a good look for me) and visibly looks much tighter.<br /><br />May have to return it...Why the inconsistency?<br /><br />Here I was ready to buy a few in different colors but in the words of the great Forrest Gump, ""You never know what you're going to get""! 😱"
2.0,Like the style but ridiculously small!!!
2.0,"These are NOT normal size. The balls are about 50% smaller than a standard ball, the bar is fine but the balls are definitely way smaller."
2.0,"way too frumpy for the USA, in CA.  It fits w/ a very high waist."
2.0,"Looks nice, but size is not even close to what it should be."
2.0,Waist fit fine but it was tight in my legs..<br />Not meant for girls with thick thighs or big quads.
2.0,"This was the 2nd order for these sunglasses. They were to go on the same pair of glassespirit when they arrived, they were too small ."
2.0,"not great, not terrible, i wish it looked a little more realistic."
2.0,"After using as directed, instead of foggy lenses I struggle to see through wet lenses. Still difficult to see. Not much help."
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Returned
2.0,The ear tips came off
2.0,stone fall off right away.. too cheap knock off couldn't last for a few hour of wear
2.0,"The bottom hem of the dress was completely crooked. The right side is several inches shorter in the front... it almost looks intentional. The dress isn't awful, but I will likely never wear it because of the hem. Would have been a nice dress at an affordable price."
2.0,look cheap but you get what you pay for so not bad for price.
2.0,"I gave this 2 stars for the price. Otherwise, I'm super disappointed. The Tulle and the fabric that ties at neck are clearly NAVY BLUE. Only the body suit portion is black and white. Considering this a Halloween costume, it's a deal breaker. I'll be returning."
2.0,"I love the print on this (it was my favorite of the ones I ordered) and ordered 3 of these same suits. But for some reason, this print (white with floral) does not have elastic in the 4 hip straps. The other 2 suits I ordered (different print only) have elastic in the straps which makes a huge difference in both the fit and how the bottoms look on me.<br />I ordered this twice thinking maybe the first one was defective but they both came like this. It is such a cute pattern and the other 2 suits look so great on but the lack of elastic on the bottoms made this one look terrible on"
2.0,"I ordered a large in hopes it would accommodate my long legs. It did not. The hips were too wide and resulted in a baggy appearance, while the length of the pants was far too short. Sending these back unfortunately. Fabric seemed to be nice quality."
2.0,Jacket is really nice!  Ordered a 12 but this runs really large or it was mislabeled.  Looks more like a 14 or a 16
2.0,Based on reviews I ordered a size up.  It is way to big.  The length is not long enough for a swim suit cover up.  This is the same length as a normal tank top.
2.0,"Great material, design/function.  Had to return this due to my fat upper thighs."
2.0,Looks cheap and not shiny
2.0,"This dress had potential with a nice, true to size fit but the fabric on this dress is very pilled and looks like I have had it for several years after 3 wears and 2 washes (following the instructions) would not recommend this product if you are looking for a quality product ..."
2.0,Very nice watch for a great price but the battery died 4 weeks after I received it. And it takes a special tool to remove the back so I will have to take it to a jeweler. I only got to where it one time. Next time I went to retrieve it the battery was dead. Disappointed. Think twice. The cost it will require and time now to take it in and have the battery changed out if not worth the cost of savings for the item.<br />My opinion? They should now send me the tool and a new battery. I will then update my review.
2.0,This is not a linen dress. It's a poly-blend crepe material. It's going back.
2.0,"Really cute piece but was huge and felt flimsy. It says that you can have it sized but the bracelet band appears/feels like plastic and it didn't seem worth the hassle or potential of it breaking and not being eligible to return. If you buy it MEASURE YOUR WRIST, it is quite large. Also the face is pretty big for how delicate the bracelet part is. Didn't work for me. I went to wally world and bought a simple black leather band watch that I COULD TRY ON and i am very pleased. If this fits you with the larger face and quite long length band it will be a nice addition to your collection but otherwise don't bother. Thanks! -Amazon Customer ('s wife)"
2.0,"Ordered XL ,TOO SMALL, MIGHT FIT THE LITTLE CHINA MAN WHO MADE IT"
2.0,Buyer beware. They say they are for baby girl/newborn but unless you have a baby that has an abnormally large head they will NOT fit. Them seem to be good quality but I will not know how they hold up for about a year since they are way to big for my 9 month old.
2.0,Uncomfortable and make your boobs look unnaturally close together.
2.0,Just didn't work for my style.
2.0,the bottoms don't fit over my ski boots
2.0,"The style is very nice, just what I was looking for.  But it runs so small.  The sizing info says bust 44 is a L.  Well I measure 41 and the L is way too small. Too tight under the arms and it barely meets around my hips, let alone wraps.  I'd guess about a size 8. Too bad because it seems well made and the charcoal color is lovely.  The fabric is a little boardy and doesn't drape.  But that's probably ok for a coat.  Just beware and order 1 or 2 sizes up and you may be very happy."
2.0,Tight fit leaving ear swollen
2.0,As I was getting ready to pack this in my suitcase for vacation I noticed a hole. I’ve requested a replacement because I like the look and fit
2.0,No support in bra - felt like used/worn elastic was used
2.0,I have a pair of these type of pants that friends bought me in Thailand.  The difference is night and day.<br />These are thin and coarse... the one's from Thailand are a bit thicker and very soft/smooth.<br />I do not recommend these at all.  I bought another brand off of amazing and they suffer from the same shortcomings.
2.0,Color is beautiful but the  necklace stone is off-set. Great for the price
2.0,"Was really excited about this order and possibility of ordering more from this seller, but my dress arrived today missing the necklace and the bows on the bodice. Disappointing to pay international shipping for a “project” dress. I’ll now need to get the dress fixed to make it as advertised. The dress also had animal fur on it."
2.0,"This shoe cover served well for 6 months, meeting my expectations. But after 6 months, the silicone membrane lost integrity and reverted to a sticky gel that tore easily when stretched. I suspect the polymer chains degenerated. I’ve had this experience before with rubberized membranes. Perhaps the buyer needs to expect 6 month’s service; this product isn’t expensive. Perhaps there’s a way to store the booties chich retards the deterioration process: cool conditions, expanded on a form that prevents the membrane from adhering to itself, a ‘fuzzy’ (non-smooth) surface of the form that prevents the silicone membrane from attaching to the form."
2.0,"For the price, I felt this bracelet was definitely not worth it. The clasp is flimsy and didn't even lock in place right out of the bag. On the first day of wearing it, it broke and the 2 safety clasps had snapped off as well."
2.0,Not as good as &#34;Seen on TV&#34; brand. Disappointed.<br />I was expecting to get better eye sight resolution. The frame is good quality though.
2.0,"For the price super cute, but it didn't last long, the band started to fade after about a month."
2.0,"Just a bracelet, nothing else"
2.0,MATERIAL EXTREMELY TOOOO THIN..SIZE SEEM TO BE SMALLER THAN MY ACTUAL SIZE
2.0,"Had high hopes for this..but meh. The hood is super tiny (looks like a pointy lil gnome hat when you flip it up), has more dark yellows/reds/and browns in the yarn - so it looks much darker, and its much shorter than the picture.<br />Its a nice thick sweater, so it's handy around the house..but ehhh, pretty bummed that it's not really the sweater in the pic."
2.0,I was disappointed when I received my package and it was missing the yellow pair and instead I got an extra pair of grey. I also was hoping they would fit my 8 month old better (I ordered the smallest size) however they do for my 2 year old niece perfectly.<br /><br />Overall they are very cute! I’m very sad that I had give these a bad rating but I was very disappointed that I did not receive what was pictured....
2.0,"Este tipo de piezas son difíciles de acertar en la talla, no recomiendo que compren si no están seguros de la talla."
2.0,"Bought these as an alternative to 5.11s. The color I needed was out of stock in the 5.11s and I couldn't wait for them to be restocked. After wearing the pants every other day for a week and a half of 10 hour admin shifts, one of the pocket seams has developed a tear. The only thing that's been in that pocket has been my phone. That doesn't inspire confidence in the long term durability of these pants."
2.0,"Weirdly shaped, waistline hits way too high. Cheap material."
2.0,This came and was too small for my son to wear
2.0,"I was super excited about this dress but sadly it didn’t fit quite right. I’m 5’10, 205lbs and very hourglass figured (equal top and bottom, slimmer middle) so I bought an xxl. The bottom of the dress fit well over my hips but the criss cross at the top was too large and saggy. The length of the sleeves could have been shorter, had I kept it I would have cut and hemmed them myself. Also the material is a little more clingy and heavy than I had hoped for the spring, summer months. I might exchange it for an XL but the material has me hesitating on that decision. I think it’s a great dress it’s just not for me."
2.0,I don’t care for the yellow color of this item.
2.0,"The material wasn't cheap, but it was way too bit.  I ordered a small, and it was more like a medium or large.  I only gave an extra star for the good material."
2.0,Not real durable. 8 time use.
2.0,Hat is fine but the brim is HUGE. Think Smalls from the Sandlot.
2.0,"I feel bad leaving a bad review, but this scrub cap is huge. I have a big head and its still way too big for my head. I brought it to work hoping someone would fit it. Unfortunately it was too big for everyone in my department. I think it's good quality And made with care though. I'm disappointed, because I was really looking forward to a Halloween scrub cap."
2.0,These did not attach well and were painful. I trimmed them and then they were tolerable
2.0,"It looks beautiful in the picture, not so much in my hand. The base of the ring looks like a wire, making it look flimsy and cheap. returned."
2.0,"can not use and I do not have a huge head, but they are so tight- it hurts. Ernie New Zealand"
2.0,"Does not look like the picture. It’s not white, more off white/gray. It’s very see through and thin. Fit was good, but definitely not the same item as in the picture."
2.0,Not of good
2.0,"The kimono was huge and might fit a 5’9” + woman in heels. Very long, excessively roomy, polyester (not summer weight) fabric"
2.0,"These are super tiny, never seen and so small!"
2.0,For less than $8 for set of 2 I should have expected these hen saddles to be poor quality. Sewing is not good. Size is a bit on the small size for standard size chickens. Wing bands have no stretch so will be uncomfortable and could cause chafing. I think I'm going to send them back for a refund so I can buy better saddles for my 2 Wyandotte hens.
2.0,No same side
2.0,Terrible fabric. Really difficult to get wrinkles out
2.0,"This was not a tight bra on me, but rather loose, and still the wire popped after only 6 weeks, and I do NOT wear a racerback daily, but only with certain tops.  So frustrating because I really liked the style and the fit. I was planning to buy another one, but then the wire broke through.  ugh."
2.0,Lovely piece to look at; wish it were as sturdy as it is pretty.<br />The clasp got stuck on very first wear & broke quite easily.<br />I returned for a replacement; perhaps the 1st one was a lemon. Will re-visit with update after I receive it.
2.0,Petty thin fabric.
2.0,"Very disappointed.  Purchased this for my 10 year old goddaughter for her birthday.  It is a lovely piece however, it is NOT for a 10 old year (although I purchased LARGE - 6 yr - 10 yr option).  This is more a new born baby to 3 months old.  Sadly I cannot give my goddaughter this!  Have to locate another gift for her."
2.0,Not to purposeful
2.0,"I have been waiting on this dress fo several days. I was very excited when it arrived today and still quite excited when I felt how soft the fabric was and how pretty the pattern.  Unfortunately, this is more like a skimpy top than the skate dress I had hoped for.<br /><br />For reference I am 5'6"" tall and an athletic 160lbs. I teach 6th grade and have several of this style dress on rotation most hit right at or above the knee. This barely skims the bottom of my behind.<br /><br />The fabric is stretchy and the bodice fits nicely, I ordered a medium, but the skirt is just too short to be of any practical use. The look is reminiscent of the old mawmaw swim dresses my granny wore in the 80s, except there us no bottom to it so your rear end is out for air.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of one because the fabric is nice, soft and stretchy, and the pattern is cute.<br /><br />I suppose if you were very short this might work out as a dress, but for those of us of average height I do NOT recommend."
2.0,I like the color and assortment of sizes but I can't use the largest pair because it arrived with one post completely unattached and the other one is bent.  The seller needs to package these differently.  The smaller ones won't bend or break as easily if they are shipped in a flat package because they are fairly flat anyway but the bigger size shouldn't be put in a flat little bag.  It's a matter of physics that the way they are packaged leads to them breaking.  I imagine lots of the big ones break before they ever get to the customer.  I bought these mostly for the smaller ones but it would have nice to have tried the big ones at least once.
2.0,I usually wear small and this small was big. The quality is really cheap as well. Not satisfied.
2.0,"These worked a few times, then they started &#34;slipping.&#34; i.e. my shirt came off the clips, and the stays ended up falling down my pant legs. Very embarrassing. After this happened a few times, I gave up on them."
2.0,I was super excited to get these in. The fit is perfect and they feel great with no real “break in” time. The only major disappointment was that the Velcro patch on the left shoe was already disconnected upon opening the box. Other than that I’ve no complaints besides the product not being in perfect condition upon arrival. I will be returning for a new pair.
2.0,"So I bought this for my son, he was so happy when he puts it on ,right length and lots of pocket,but he goes to put his hand in the right pocket and he was sad when he realized his hand would not go in ,he only could get his fingers in,the left pocket was perfect and the right one was almost not there so we had to send it back ,so disappointed."
2.0,"Cute blouse, but way too long and XL was a tight fit. I guess I'll have to loose a little for it to fit properly...not"
2.0,Ordered cranberry and got blue
2.0,Fit good but when I opened the package there was a black stain on the corner shoulder
2.0,"I bought these for pug-loving husband. He’s a skinny boy (?6’2” 150 lbs). He couldn’t even get them on, so sadly we had to return them."
2.0,"It was pretty long, and I'm 5'10&#34;.  Bulky around the midsection."
2.0,Won't last long.
2.0,This was not what I needed and not as described.  Picture of product looked better than actual item.  I would not recommend.
2.0,Photo is misleading.  I bought for soccer....too short.  Cute regular sock.
2.0,"I was surprised how small the x-large is when put on.  I was sure this was to be a good fit, but wasn't.  I love the material, and the length, however, the size is too small."
2.0,"Its cute, but to small."
2.0,Just clung weirdly.
2.0,the case fits fine but worth about $2 in rubbery plastic
2.0,"The packaging came damage and not supported. Then they would fall apart as I tried using them.<br />If anything, I was able to give it a 2 cuz I was able  to use the stars out of them so it wasn't a complete loss. But definitely not another buy!"
2.0,The shirt was perfectly sized the style and print great. The color was peach. Not even light pink. The picture shows vibrant pink. So do not order if you hate peach. Which I do.
2.0,"Dress is comfortable and nice fit and length; however, it is so light/sheer it's basically see-through, but with a slip it worked. Until I walked outside where it's insanely hot here. Any bit of moisture on the dress (spilled water/sweat, etc) is extremely noticeable! Would not buy again."
2.0,"Material is soft and very comfortable, too bad the fitting is so strange.  The cut is extremely large in the hips in a really weird way."
2.0,"I usually wear a Large, sometimes an Extra Large if something runs small. I ordered this in a Large and I completely swam in it. A medium would still be too big. It looked cute when I took it out of the package, but I couldn't tell if it would look cute on me since it was so big."
2.0,It's a steady going looking belt. But it hard to release when you wearing it.
2.0,"The bag is cute enough. But I’ve been using it for two weeks and the straw is already beginning to unweave :(. It makes me sad that I may have to stop using it. It is the perfect summer time bag, other than the fraying..."
2.0,The piece is really cute but it was machined wrong. The stem is to short in compairison to the rest of it. I wouldn't purchase again. I will return it.
2.0,Nothing like the picture the color is fadded it really don't pop like the picture. I think if I knew what it really looked like i would have passed.
2.0,For an A&A piece it’s really flimsy and the metal it very thin....not really happy with it.
2.0,"Very cheap, get holes in them easy"
2.0,Nit what expected
2.0,These either kept coming unclamped from one side or broke.  I wish I would have worn them sooner so I could have returned ☹️<br />Waste of money$
2.0,Fits large I'm 6'1&#34; 138 lbs and it was cut but one size too big and wish it was a little longer.
2.0,"The charm was very small for the price! Amazon detailed it as small, but I figured the price wouldn’t make it so small! My mother passed and I wanted a charm with the word mom! Plus it had wings on the heart! That made it extra special!"
2.0,This is not a xxl. The pants are so tiny. I really wanted to love this but it was a waste of money. The rich red color shown is not the color. It's a faded rust color. So disappointed!!!
2.0,"It was very cute, but rusted after one wear. I guess you get what you pay for but I expected to wear it at least a couple times before it rusted."
2.0,"The bag design is good but the materials used are cheap and not durable, particularly the zippers. I recommend looking at an army surplus shop for better quality."
2.0,This shoe wore out quick for my grandaughter. It appeared that it was ill fitting and maybe defected.
2.0,it's broken after only 1month of purchase. Poor quality
2.0,I'm 5'8 165lb and 2m post partum. I bought this for easy access to the milk supply but the elastic waist loose and seemed higher than it should be. Returning.
2.0,Cute toy doesn’t do as much as I thought it would but my daughter liked it. Battery life sucks though
2.0,Nice design and looks good on. I found it a little uncomfortable between my fingers. The width is fine it’s the stones and design that were bothersome. I gave it to my sister. I just couldn’t deal with way it felt against my other fingers.
2.0,The proportions on this dress are WAY off. I am typically a 12-14 in clothes and following the chart I chose to go up a size to the Xl as I'd rather it be slightly too big than too small. I could barely get it up over my arms. I think even if I had ordered the 2xl it would not have fit. Regardless the neckline didn't feel like it'd be comfortable at all sitting up so high. I have a lot of cleavage and it was strangling my chest and almost felt like it was choking me.
2.0,Ok so I read the reviews before buying I knew it was gonna be thin but holy cow I'm a little shocked BC it says its 100% cotton but my shirt has a shine to it an the fabric does not feel like cotton if it is its a very low grade cotton. The shirt came with threads all over the sleeve I had to cut off and the arm sleeves are tighter then what I thought I sized up BC I'm pregnant an wanted to wear it open with some flowy give to it. I had a couple in my cart I was gonna buy when I purchased this but I knew I better see how it is before I buy more. I'm glad I did that BC I wouldn't buy again an just pay for a better quality cotton shirt. I'd return the shirt also if I didn't think it would take a while an be a pain. I'm going to wash an hang dry an see if the feel gets better at all an see if the shine goes away or not. I'll find a way to use this shirt or give it to my daughter to just play in or use a swim suit cover up.
2.0,"Super cute but smells like chemicals :( am trying to wash the smell out, but if that doesn't work I likely won't be giving this as a gift as I intended. Bummer because it's cute!"
2.0,The bra fit too small for me. I ordered the x-large and I'm a DDD cup.
2.0,Runs small and is very short. Order 1 size up and be prepared to show some legs.
2.0,"Got size 10, if you're a 10 1/2 and need some cheep tap dancing shoes these are for you."
2.0,"I wanted to love this, but with no stretch vertically, it was impossible to get on. I am normally a medium and ordered a large hoping that this would help the issue, but I would have needed probably an XL or 2X to actually get it up to my shoulders."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:9360e543775b031f00235b3d7fd3daa5]] The sizing is off this is cute but it is more than a loose fit it’s baggy in the wrong parts plus the large looks like a 2xl and if your shirt it will touch the floor which that’s not a problem size down
2.0,"I ordered a medium and it was 2 sizes too big , seams don't line up and a little longer than expected"
2.0,Very hard to remove links without damaging watch
2.0,"They arrived and one link did not function. they accepted my return without and issue, but I would have prefered a working product."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:a582d0dd10c33286340f7764f002364e]] I must honestly say that I am totally perplexed by this product. While the theory behind the product is exceptional, the practicality and functionality are lacking. At 4'11&quot;, there is nothing more that I would love than to gain a few inches.  I purchased the AirBaby by HeelBorne with high hopes of achieving new height.  Unfortunately, I am unable get these inserts to fit in any shoe I wear.<br /><br />Included: 4 total heel inserts.<br /><br />Material: Rating 4/5<br />The insert is made of a flexible foam rubber type substance that is completely bendable. The upper insert is fitted with a air gel cushion to add additional comfort.  Both parts fit together like a puzzle piece with protruding slots to lock the fit.<br /><br />Height Addition: Rating 5/5<br />The product itself is 2 inches high when using both pieces. Stepping on the foam insert will surely increase your height my this measurement.<br /><br />Functionality: Rating 1/5<br />As exhibited in my pics and video, I am unable to get these inserts to fit in any shoe I own.  The concept is that it should fit in your tennis/running shoes thus I attempted this feat.  The insert is so tall that it occupies more than half of the inside of the shoe. It makes it so you cannot even slide your foot inside the shoe without almost totally untying it.  I attempted fit with both inserts and then just one. Both results in my foot being so high in the shoe that it extended too far out. This yielded issues when walking as my foot slipped out of the shoe. The insert is not practical. If anywhere, I would prefer to gain height would be in a heel, not a gym shoe. I am an avid runner. There is no way that you could focus on performance with this insert in place.  A total fail for my use.  (I wear a size 5 Women's shoe)<br /><br />I rate this product an overall 2/5.  While the functionality of the product fail to meet my expectations, the design and theory behind the product are feasible. Perhaps, your luck will be different.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount, as a product tester, in exchange for an honest review. My review is based solely on product use and experience."
2.0,not great quality.
2.0,"This confused me. I don’t know what kind of piercing you would put this in. I bought it for my Tragus and it looked ridiculous. Tried my cartilage also but did not look right. But I mean I really don’t see it being cute in a daith, rook or conch either. So I don’t understand the point of this piece of jewelry. But it did seem like alright quality."
2.0,"Too small, not true to size."
2.0,"The top is way to small, I'm a 34C. I couldn't even wear it. The fabric is not the same as the picture"
2.0,They tapers were cool but the tunnels were plastic. And when you try to wash them with alcohol they get yo being a little sticky. I didn't like these too much.
2.0,"This dress was a disappointment. The fabric is thin and cheap quality and it is definitely cut on the small side. I’m using it as a swimsuit cover, but I wouldn’t wear it as a dress in public."
2.0,"A little heavier weight fabric than I imagined. It’s short on me (ankle length) and I’m only 5’7.  To fix this, I styled a knot at the hem. Also the pockets lay funny, I might cut them out."
2.0,"Pajamas were cute but even when washing on delicate cycle, the material beads up and gets fuzzy. Wish the material was of a little higher quality."
2.0,"I purchased these shoes for my disabled son - the velcro closing is a must. However, the sizing is absolutely not in sync with other velcro-closing shoes I've purchased in the past, as these are definitely too snug. He can still wear them, but only with the thinnest socks and I'm hoping they'll stretch a little with wear."
2.0,"Immediate wear and tear after just wearing them for less than one day. I tried contacting the company since this was encouraged in the packaging, but unfortunately the first thing they asked me was if I rubbed the joggers against something in order for them to look that way. I don’t think I would be reaching out to them if it was something of my doing. But also, you would think that even if they were rubbed against something, this much wear and tear wouldn’t occur after not even one day. They haven’t even been washed yet but they still had wear and tear. Makes me think maybe they arrived that way and I didn’t notice. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,For a size small it was still baggy
2.0,Too small and looked like it turned dark dark bronze. Cheap.
2.0,This item tarnished before I could even wear it. Returning it.
2.0,"I ordered a red, blue, gray, black, and white. I got 2 black, 2 gray, and a blue."
2.0,Got my trainer on Friday put it on and it has already ripped down the side boning. The fabric and boning separated. Going to see if I can continue using it or if I have to order a new one
2.0,Not good for the price. Kinda disappointed with it.
2.0,Great idea but poorly executed. Mine came in today and the fit is off by a couple mm. It cuts off a bit from the top bar of the display key and the BMW roundel button for locking isn't quite centered. I'm hoping that after a bit of time and tugging it will loosen up but not holding my breath.
2.0,Glare is terrible.  Wouldn't recommend for sports.
2.0,"I thought these were cute as I don't like large earrings. They were difficult to put on since the post is curved. My daughter couldn't get them on at all. My ears hurt after wearing them, so I'm not sure if they are truly stainless steel as I am sensitive to materials. Returned them."
2.0,The cut of the boot is a little weird and it feels super uncomfortable. It looks nice but buy a better boot.
2.0,"Ok I have to say that these shoes are super sexy an very well made, however! I’m a size 9 ordered a 9 received a 9 (as per the box etc) but they fit like a 10! I tried to do it but I can’t so had to return. I may order an 8 and see if it feels like a 9 super bummed."
2.0,Comfortable slides
2.0,"The dress is a very cute pattern. However it was unfortunately way too short, if I were to lift my hands slightly everything would be on display. The fabric I also wasn’t a fan of. It felt like sheer curtain but it would have been great to wear in the sun because of how breezy it is."
2.0,There is not enough room for toes at all. Hurts my toes so much.  Don’t  recommend.
2.0,Face is a darker blue that shown in picture not even close to purple.  Broke on my daughter after about a week.
2.0,The shirt looks roomy as if it could be bloused over leggings or skinny jeans and that just did not happen.  I gave it to my middle school daughter because that's how small it ran.
2.0,Runs at least two sizes too small.
2.0,I ordered the navy hoodie w red lettering. The lettering is white. Wish I would have read the reviews before because it seems like a common problem. It's a nice hoodie and I'm still going to wear it but I am a bit disappointed.
2.0,"First the good:  colors are beautiful and jacket is super soft and comfy.<br /><br />The bad, and annoying…: Zipper broke the first day. The zipper and it’s pull are both too small. I managed to fix it but I’m certain it won’t hold for long. Son loves the jacket so I’ll likely have to bring it to a seamstress to have a better zipper put on."
2.0,Color rubbed off.
2.0,I do not like that they run so small and there is nothing included about return shipment.
2.0,"I wanted to love this. I really did. The pattern was nice and the fabric is kind of heavy, but the cut in the front is a little weird, it was too long for me AND the pockets were strange. their directly on the seam, making my hips look even larger than they are AND they're too small to even be useful. Returning"
2.0,"According to size chart,  large should be comfortable. But it's super tight. Cuff for ankle hurts, caused foot fall sleep...<br /><br />Should have gotten xL for 14 1/2 inches calf, even tho chart said large should fit fine and comfortable.<br /><br />Overrall, Not really happy with product even tho it is pretty to eyes."
2.0,Very thin. Have to wear a shirt under it
2.0,"It was a lot longer than expected. I sized up because things online tend to run smaller on me, but it was like a potato sack on me. It fit perfect around my busy but everything else about it was too big."
2.0,"The pattern is cute. Not the typical legging material though. Super see through, feels more slick than soft. No way you could wear these with out showing off more than you should."
2.0,"cute, good looking, zippers were faulty"
2.0,"Really liked how this jammer looked and was looking forward to wearing it at the pool or beach. Unfortunately, when I tried them on, I noticed (or uncomfortably felt) a thick seam that went right up the middle of this swimsuit. For a skintight jammer, thats a big discomforting no no...<br />I guess their was no false advertising involved though. If you want your cojones &#34;spliced&#34;, go right ahead and buy this Men's Splice Jammer Fashion Swimsuit.<br /><br />Returned."
2.0,"It is beautiful but second time I wore it, just fell apart"
2.0,"Def NOT no show...even with heels that have generous toe coverage, these were still visible."
2.0,Nicely made however! I ordered an extra large the size are more like a 2-3X disappointed but I gave them to someone who could use them in their exercise goals... You may have to order 1- 2 sizes down
2.0,Does not look exactly as pictured (or at least to me). It was huge and that really stretchy material.
2.0,"The shoes r smaller than US standard size. If u like them, u have to size up 1 or half. Actually the shoes smell so bad n cheap material."
2.0,"Although the fitting was correct, the hip area was cut in a thong like manner revealing my hips, stomach and back areas. theres not way to cover it with jeans or a skirt. (try to think of 1980's thong one piece bathing suit)"
2.0,The fit is fine but the lens made no difference at all. Should have returned them.
2.0,After 2-3 washes the material feels odd. Like it’s not good quality. Fuzzies all high contact points( under arms). Makes it look bad when it’s new
2.0,"Loved these pants, but after wearing the 2x the zipper stopped working. Not ideal in cold weather 😳. Needless to say, I had to return them."
2.0,Nice but the back was a screw on. Could have been better but it looks nice.
2.0,This wrap would not stay tight and constantly did the electric slide off my head 🙄.
2.0,Doesn't hold a charge and sizes are way off.
2.0,"2 holes on the back are oddly placed, and weird. It's pretty long. Wasn't my best purchase, but it's ok."
2.0,"I love the colors , but when I open it one stone had fallen off. Disappointed."
2.0,I don't think I received the correct necklace.  I got a quarter moon gold colored necklace that's real cheap.
2.0,Didn't expect much for the price but the material is unlike anything I&#34;ve ever seen - looks adorale in the photo but it's not something I could wear out of the house.. maybe on Halloween with a costume!
2.0,"These slippers were a replacement, They run small, no toe room.  I have to fold the back down to walk in the slippers. The width is fine.  They looked exactly like the picture. I purchased the 9-10 Surblue Women’s Ballerina Bing Metallic Shine Warm Indoor House Cozy Sequin Slippers. I  normally wear 9 1/2.  I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"I'm a 34 B-C and although the medium bra was the correct size, it just didn't fit quite right.  The shoulder straps rubbed against the side of my neck in an uncomfortable way. And it just didn't feel right. I ended up returning it."
2.0,"I’m 5’6” and weigh about 120, I ordered a small and they were huge. In all the wrong places. Really unattractive"
2.0,2 pairs were broken.  Very cheap quality
2.0,"Cheaply made and can pop open easily on some, but good for use as giveaways"
2.0,"Tried an XL based on the size chart and the fit was surprisingly perfect, nothing I'd want to change. Sadly, the textile feels like intensely synthetic costume fabric. The print is really neat and the cut is really cute, but it feels awful to wear."
2.0,"These are too large and slip off of my face. They can’t be used as a mask if you don’t have a large head. Additionally, these should NOT be used in replace of a mask. The material is so thing and did not pass the “blow out a candle” test. These won’t protect you from COVID.<br /><br />The patterns are cute, but the stitching was extremely sloppy and there were loose threads hanging off."
2.0,I found that the inside was to long and it would stick out of my nose. The prongs were to sharp and would catch on my towel and a cotton ball when I would wash my face.
2.0,"Boots were mis shapened upon arrival.  Fur is already falling off.  No support in these boot and the heel squishes when walking like they are hollow.  The lining is the boots keep my calves warm BUT there is no insulation for the feet, so my feet get cold.  I am glad I got these on sale and didn't pay full price.  Cheap, cheap, CHEAP!"
2.0,"No matter how tight I made the googles, water just seemed to get into them.<br />Making them super tight wasn't too comfortable either."
2.0,Too soft for my needs but comfortable
2.0,"Extra material drooped around my lower back  - and I ordered a small. I have a 27-28&#34; waist and am definitely not hourglass-shaped; because I'm the opposite of a curvy build, with most dresses I actually have the opposite problem - too tight around the middle and loose everywhere else. So I was surprised that the dress was baggy in the back yet fit my bust and lower body."
2.0,I bought a size bigger than she wears and its still too small
2.0,I bought this for my 5 year old very warm and soft but after  only 2 times used the elastic started coming out very disappointed.
2.0,The post broke off only after one time wearing them.
2.0,"Not a thing  to do with a jeans or a jacket or denim at all!  It is simply a light blue shirt, cute,  but NOT what you are lead to believe it is.  Bummer!"
2.0,"The model's hair in the photo is covering the top, but it lays weird. It curves in at the straps in a distracting, unflattering way."
2.0,"This bracelet was reviewed before and people said that it was for a tiny wrist. I ordered it anyway because my wrist is pretty small. This bracelet is really for a child's wrist to be honest. It is really pretty and sparkly, but hard to get on and leaves about a half inch of wiggle room for  small wrists like mine. I like the bracelet, but I do plan on wearing it often, because of the trouble it takes just to put on."
2.0,Not relaxed fit. My husband wears a 40. Not even close to a 40.
2.0,"I was a bit surprised upon receiving this shirt. I guess I thought it was a sweater, which it's not, and it was supposed to be a 6/6x (at least that's what the tag said).  If that is Disney's version of 6/6x, they may want to hire another person for measuring.  Maybe they meant the 6x for the width, because I'm quite certain the length was a 4. Regardless, it had Elsa on it, so the kiddo couldn't care less. We've been pretty disappointed with Disney lately, at least the clothing. I think I've finally learned my lesson and won't purchase clothing from them any longer."
2.0,"The item was ver difficult to place and have both halves line up correctly. However, the worst part was how much pain cause after wearing the item for 20min and then couldn’t wear gain for several days if they due to sensitivity from the intense pressure. I would just suggest get the real piercing because these hurt 100x worst."
2.0,I ordered the pink in a M. I am very disappointed in the color. The item is clearly not what was advertised.
2.0,"Its a beautiful piece and worth the price but the chain is very weak. It broke the forst day, ive tried to repair it but im going to have to get a stronger chain. Wven on the loosest it could be it still found a way to come apart.."
2.0,"Cute cut and patterns but SUPER thin material.  Any bra or other lines/bumps on top front WILL show.  I purchased the one with the solid purple top.  I am 36b, 145 lbs, bought size L."
2.0,Smaller than I anticipated and feels cheap...hence the price.
2.0,They are very big and bulky..can’t adjust the ear loops. Disappointed with the design of the mask but the color combos are pretty.
2.0,Quality and look was great! HOWEVER I give 2 stars because of sizing<br />I ordered an extra small for my boy... and it fit like a large
2.0,Not any better than less expensive models .
2.0,"Work outside a lot, the ol' glasses go slip, sliding around, these anti slip glasses sleeves did nothing to address the problem. If lived in a cooler climate or was less active outside, may work fine."
2.0,This item was too large so i had to return it
2.0,shrunk two sizes
2.0,"The cups were way too small, but it fit"
2.0,I am 5’6” 145-50 lb woman and the 2X fits. It fits like a women’s large.
2.0,Very vibrant but material way to stiff even after I washed it I was not able to use it
2.0,"Would not buy again. Cheap and not flattering, really thick and make my skin itch."
2.0,Heavy and there are<br />dimensional words on the wire where it rests inside my piercing hole which irritates the skin. Won't be wearing them.
2.0,"Loved the picture of this dress, but the fit is horrible it isn't a flattering loose fit.  The material is also not a good quality and super thin."
2.0,I got it earlier than expected which was great but the quality is not what it appears. What looks like metal is plastic.
2.0,Was expecting a larger fit. Feels like a Medium. Going to Reorder
2.0,thats what you get when you buy cheap stuff it comes with cheap material
2.0,"The colors were inverted, shows a white skirt with yellow flowers but it’s yellow skirt with white flowers.<br />Nice flow and hang but was short. I am 6ft tall and ordered the XXL and it was about 4-5 inches to short."
2.0,"if you want something simple for a everyday use , I totally recommend it , is minimalistic but the color is not pretty is cheap gold , not a heavy weight"
2.0,I don't believe it to be authentic sterling silver because I broke out in an itchy rash after wearing it for only  the one day I had it on. I can no longer wear this necklace. :( I've worn sterling silver before and never had a reaction.
2.0,I wasn't crazy about this product. Its pretty but feels weird when on.
2.0,"The band seems well made and the chain appears solid, however, it is totally useless as the chain clasp is loose and keeps coming off. My watch has fallen off several times, and I've had to stop using the chain to avoid damaging my watch."
2.0,I dislike the fact this product is not purple as shown on Amazon. The item does NOT represent my university colors. As a matter of fact it's brown
2.0,"Very cheap material, oversized cotton shirt. Not worth the price I paid for it."
2.0,These fit small and are extremely thin.
2.0,The front of the necklace was beautiful however the back had a purple / green discoloration on the back but since it was a gift I gave it to them anyway. Was slightly disappointed giving a gift with a large discoloration on it. I tried to clean it with sliver cleaner but it didn't remove it.
2.0,I’ve purchased several dresses and tops from this brand and I really love the style and design but the sizing is very inconsistent. In addition some of the items I got are very well made when some others not so.<br />This particular dress has simply too much going on. The black laced stripes on the chest area were uneven on both sides..... I had to return it.
2.0,"This purse did not come with a dust cover and it was packed poorly.  There was an indentation from the purse handle on the front of the bag...that is still there! I paid too much for this bag.  I also believe it is from several years ago.  I can not even pull up the bag on the Coach web site.  I notice you also do the same with Frye shoes and purses.  They are styles from several years before, yet the prices are ridiculous!!  Amazon shame on you.  You will do much better going to the official web site.  You will get quality recent items with dust bags.  Shame on you AMAZON!!!!<br />Thinking about returning this item."
2.0,it's okay I need to find a better one
2.0,The top layer is net and feels very cheap to wear
2.0,This dress just doesn't fit my body right. I'm a large chested woman and this dress made me feel  like I was much larger then I really am. It's soft and feels good on the skin just not for me.
2.0,"So the colors on the actual item are a bit different. the area that looks light red is actually a very, vibrant red. There is a bright red all over the sweater and very small bit of blue."
2.0,I like this product but it’s too weak..<br />I could use it two months only :(
2.0,It looks better pictured. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the fabric at all.
2.0,Shirt is smaller than the size I ordered.<br />Too tight at the arms..<br />Material makes me itch..<br />I’m afraid to gently hand wash the shirt for it might shrink to a little poodle size.<br />Disappointed with this purchase..
2.0,The fabric was nice and the dress fit well but it is so short! For reference I am 5’8” with a booty and it barely covered my butt. Would not recommend for tall girls. Color was true to what was pictured.
2.0,I have real diamond earrings as well as a Cubic Zirconia set. These were a huge disappointment.  The setting was VERY cheap and it was obvious.  I returned them immediately.
2.0,"Cheap looking glasses, I've left them in the plastic bag they came in as an emergency pair... don't like them."
2.0,"Previous had to return a medium size , ordered a large and it is quite short and cannot stretch due to the lace. First dress had tags on them, second dress did not...hmmm I wonder if it was a return...<br />Will probably return. Not woth the price, o tried to love it."
2.0,This shirt is VERY thin and the buttons are barely hanging on. It’s a cute print but I’m not sure it’s worth the price. You can find better quality with lower prices at real stores!
2.0,Had very high expectations for this bag but unfortunately it is not that great. The bag looks good but it is not sawn properly. I had stitches coming out of the bag after only two trips...<br /><br />Will be returning
2.0,If you have a long torso it is very short comma it is made of two separate pieces a sheer pencil skirt and a leotard. Leotard didn't even cover my chest when I put it on so way too short for me. The sheer pencil skirt that was nice.
2.0,"Nothing more than a thin, tiny, glorified blanket. I didn’t expect a lot for the price and was still disappointed."
2.0,I disliked I ordered my size to be a little bigger and it was to small needed a 3xlg
2.0,"Well, I bought this to go with my grandson's Mandalorian costume. Little did I know it would cost more than his actual costume. But he really wanted to entire set so what's a grandma to do but provide it for them? Lol. I definitely would have shopped around more had I had the extra time, but we were doing a photo shoot and it all barely came together just the day before the shoot. This is a nice accessory,  but way over priced. I think it's value tops would rank around a $7-$12 value at the most. I paid $25. Keep comparing prices, if you have time as a luxury."
2.0,The clasp needs to be inspected before releasing to public for final approval
2.0,Cute but the sizing is a couple sizes too small.
2.0,"I am normally a size 12-14 bust size 38.  The 1x fit, but it was very small.  I thought it was going to fit more like a longer tunic. I like the soft stretchy material, but it's way too small.  I am going to return it."
2.0,"I returned these pajamas. I really wanted to love them they are so cute. They material felt really stiff. I sized up for looseness and they didn’t fit loosely. I am a 36D and the XL was tight on my chest, I don’t like that in pajamas. I’m sure these would be a much better fit for small chested individuals."
2.0,"These are pretty large for children's gloves. They might fit a 14 year old girl but they are not close to the right size for my 10 year old girl.<br /><br />Also, they had dirty fingers when they came. They have definitely been used before I received them."
2.0,Not a great buy for full breast women
2.0,"Two stars because I liked the fit and the pants were flattering on my curvy frame (still working off covid weight!). The problems were fabric and lining in the white option. Fabric was sheer, almost silky, lining went down only halfway to knees. The result looked i was wearing mens white boxers under my pants, a very unfortunate look. The other colors may look better but I can't imagine a scenario where I would wear the white ones in public."
2.0,It's cheap. Very cheap. Not worth the price. I have regret.<br /><br />Literal cheap plastic and gaudy.
2.0,Not as cute as pictured.  The bow definitely does not look like that.  The bow does not sit where it does in the picture so it doesnt look right.  I wore it without it.
2.0,Great for the Roaring 20's Party we attended on New Year's Eve.  Only problem is one of the finger seams was split and I wasn't aware until I dressed for the affair.  Otherwise they were a great fit and feel.  Just order and inspect them well before you need them.
2.0,Great as gift for little girls.
2.0,The Sleeves are big and not long enough. Can’t pull the sleeves up like in the picture either. Not as good of quality as I would like.
2.0,Broke while wearing
2.0,Just super light tint. It was cut pretty good. Just wish it was darker.
2.0,Cute bracelet but the clasps is hard to adjust. The chain pops easily and the beads fall off. I replaced one just to have the same issue.
2.0,"Very cute patterns, but super thin. Not going to last long at all."
2.0,It is almost impossibe to latch this necklace because of the tiny round hole that can't be latched unless you have someone to help you do it.
2.0,Looks cheaper than an engagement ring from Kmart.  I can’t even begin to describe what a train wreck this midnight implies purchase was.<br />Size down and don’t order are my suggestions<br />Tie is fake so it’s nit actually adjustable<br />Look at hem pic
2.0,I have a pair that I purchased at a brick and mortar store and I love them. The pairs purchased via Amazon are not as substantial in fabric thickness. These pair were thin and a bit too see through.
2.0,"The material feels pretty low quality.  The buttons are not real buttons, I was disappointed but I kept this anyway since it is so cheap."
2.0,"This dress was made well for the price, but the waist is an empire cut. Combine that height with the skirt and it makes you look less like a fairy and more like a fairy godmother. I returned it."
2.0,smaller than pictured.  I tried to go by the backing but it is MORE  than half the size of the face of the stud.<br />Very pretty however best for a child.  3/8&#34;
2.0,length of all 4 items 1/2 inch short in length. Poor and uncomfortable fit as edges fall directly on the highest point of your cheek and rub. not comfortable. may fit a child better.
2.0,"Delivery was prompt, but directions are scant, and it simply doesn't work.  Mine is jammed or something, and I cannot even begin to see how to fix it."
2.0,"Looks as cheap as it was so I can't be mad! Not worth returning but, don't like...probably never wear."
2.0,the separate bagging was nice however nothing was labeled/together. multiple mix ups and duplicates.
2.0,"Broke the first day, so upset."
2.0,Come apart after wearing one time
2.0,This would be cute for a young girl maybe.<br />It's cute
2.0,"I just don't like this cap Its Cheaply made, well duhh its Cheap period.<br />Don't waste your money, Seriously."
2.0,Nice pants but run very small . I ordered these extra large<br />Because in the winter we exercise outdoors and I layer pants underneath these. There is no way these barely fit😌 AND they shrunk even though they were washed in cold<br />Water and line dried!
2.0,It is more like a windbreaker not a rain jacket it is paper-thin and When a heavy rain comes it’s not going to protect you from the rain like a real rain jacket does
2.0,"Wore it for a wedding and a holde formed near my hips. Not a bad price for a one night event, but if your looking for something more long lasting this aint it"
2.0,no quedo o se be como en la foto
2.0,"Very dark as described. However they degrade vision, especially distance. They are NOT mirrorized."
2.0,It looked like it was made in a sweat shop. Quality was not what I ezpected.
2.0,"Print doesn't hold up, not worth it!"
2.0,I wear a size 11 busty and the large was to small. Very sad
2.0,"I was expecting something more comfortable for my 3 yearold to wear, the fabric is thick and the sides a rough on the inside on thighs... ended up throwing it away."
2.0,nice wallet but dont like the smell of the leather
2.0,My granddaughter wanted smd was too small for her
2.0,"I'm a bit torn on this review.  These goggles don't leak and they don't fog. That's great. On the flip side, the first time I wore them they gave me really terrible raccoon eyes. By that I mean they left a a dark indentation under my eyes that didn't go away until the next day. I have very fair, sensitive skin.<br /><br />A few days later, I loosened the strap and tried them out on another 30 minute swim, thinking maybe they were just too tight. It made no difference! I climbed out of the pool 2 hours ago and the marks are still there. I feel too embarrassed to go anywhere looking like this! On top of that, one side of the nose piece came unattached when I took them off and now  I can't get it to go back together. I'm not too upset though. I don't ever want to wear these again."
2.0,"I ordered the black and yellow pom beanie in hopes I could get a good nice looking pom beanie but wound up receiving a way too large beanie. It looks as seen in the picture but does not fit as appears it is soft and thick, but too long and too loose along the headband area."
2.0,"The product doesn't fit as stated in the description. Like to wear this under my polo shirts because it's breathable material, but after a few minutes the shirt starts to sink down the front and back."
2.0,"If you get anything and I mean ANYTHING on it, it will stain. The stain is impossible to get out so I've only worn it once. And for the record, it was toothpaste I got on it which normally comes out of clothing in the wash... Not with this. Also, it was really big and I ordered a medium when I was 9 months pregnant. Not exactly flattering..."
2.0,The material was super itchy and could snag easily. It is super thin and it is bunchy elastic around the top. The sleeves were way too long and very loose.
2.0,Not very warm or wind proof.  Used as motorcycle pants (similar to snowmobiling) and these could use extra lining from knee down shin as well as at hips.  Nice quality pants.
2.0,"Bought these for my father, but he ended up not using all of them. These aren't like what they give you at the hospital, much thinner and showed signs of wear after 1 or 2 wearings."
2.0,Very thin material and  flimsy.
2.0,The size chart isn't accurate but this was still cute as a swim suit cover maybe
2.0,"What a joke.  For the cost, I guess I expected more.  I could tell it was a returned item since the case was dirty and the sunglasses were not much better."
2.0,Smaller than I expected - my own fault for not reading entire description. Can buy the larger size at local boutique for $5. I ordered two and they arrived flattened and were still misshapen after I tried to fluff them. Photo is deceiving.
2.0,"Muy bonito pero no funciona según las especificaciones,"
2.0,Its transparent.  Not the best choice
2.0,"The very first time I unzipped this purse, the metal zipper came unattached from the ring and the two sides of the zipper track became separated. The purse itself is adorable and stylish, but if I cannot trust it to safely hold my phone, keys, wallet, etc. then it's just not worth it for me."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these socks but I don’t. They are WAY too tight in the upper calf and by the time I took them off in the evening, I had indentations in my calves till the next morning, and I have legs on the thin side. Won’t be buying again, most likely."
2.0,Not the color I thought it was. More of a mustard yellow not light yellow.
2.0,The arm holes seems really small for something that is supposed to be a loose/flowy cover up. I liked the print and the fabric was perfect for the purpose would be very quick drying but due to the fit it's just not something that I will grab over other cover ups that I own. If you have larger upper arms or want something super oversized like I did I would pass.
2.0,"I really want to love this.  I love the gem, and the feather.  It's a real cute piece.  I've had it for a couple weeks now and worn it about 6 or so times.  The gold coloring is already worn off and it's a dull reddish brown color around the chain.  I'll probably add the feather and gem to different chains."
2.0,These are very &#34;tiny&#34; beads which I don't think are going to last long.  Just not durable enough for a pair of reading glasses.
2.0,The rubberband was skinny and not as pictured. The rhinestone was sunken in and not sticking out like the picture. I maiked them back. The thread was crooked so they were not completely horizontal when screwed together. And they were too long for my ear and sagged. Did not lay flush with my ear.
2.0,I didn't really like this Linen Dresses. The material looked a bit faded and it wasn't flattering to my figure at all.
2.0,"Bought for gift. Way too small for a large. Zipper sticks, so had to open"
2.0,"Looks good when it arrived, but steel piece just broke off on the 3rd day. I still wear it sometimes but wish it still has the steel piece on it."
2.0,This was more of a tunic than a dress and I am only 5’4.
2.0,Delivered with a snag and a lot smaller then noted in description.  Low quality.  So sad was looking forward to it.
2.0,"They fit like something a 'Body Builder' would like.....skin tight.  Too bad, because they are nice."
2.0,Main strap near buckle failed in 6 months. Leather is too thin/weak.
2.0,Looks pretty but the bar was not curved. I'll have to try to bend it but I didn't have high expectations for $3
2.0,Very cheap product the material deteriats easily and will not actually keep your head warm
2.0,Looks nice supper small i got it one size bigger still don’t fit
2.0,the sleeves are pretty short and sizes run small...there's also no tag to tell you which is the front and which is the back
2.0,They slide off the hair to easy. Thought it was bigger. Nice colors
2.0,"I wanted to like this top a lot, but after months it is still sitting in my closet. It is VERY loose, which is what I wanted but it is so loose that it makes you appear larger than you are. I was planning on wearing it under sweaters for a casual look, but sadly just don't feel it is flattering."
2.0,Beware that this 17&#34; necklace can fit in a 1 in square baggie.
2.0,"It's not exactly perfect but then again, it's not exactly bad either. I put it on round bedtime. Where it for a while before I turned in. Every time I put the drag on, I woke up the next morning with it off so it isn't really that strong. Although I guess it depends on how tight you tie it around your hair."
2.0,"I liked these leggings and was excited to receive them. I have another pair and wanted more colors, but they arrived with a hole. It’s on the rear end and they are not wearable. Disappointing"
2.0,I bought a size up and it's still tight. And there's no pocket. I should have paid attention.
2.0,I like the look and how it fastens together.  I send it back because I chose another bracket.
2.0,"Image not as big as advertised,<br />Neck too large"
2.0,"Not happy with quality.  The attached heart chain fell off while my daughter was wearing it and is lost so because of that, I don't believe I can return it since part of it is missing.  The part that you twist off to attach the charms consistently comes undone.  The charm that we purchased to have on it is a specialized photo charm of my father in law who just passed away in Sept and my daughter and because I am so afraid of that falling off, we don't allow her to wear the bracelet."
2.0,Nice material but there are no pockets. Will be returning for this reason.
2.0,"First of all, the white color IS see-thru. No question about it. Also, armpit holes are too large and fit is just awkward, overall. I’ll only wear it around the house and to sleep in."
2.0,Got water under the face from just being near water when washing my hands the first time. Stopped working after 3 days
2.0,the cute jacket is not reversable and the zipper is metal and cheap. the hood tie is a shoestring....
2.0,Poor quality and not a nice design like the image shown
2.0,Turned out way bulkier and giant than I'd anticipated. It barely fits in my purse.
2.0,Received earrings with crystals already falling out. Disappointed.
2.0,Cheaply made and runs really big.
2.0,Dress seem smaller in size than what I ordered. Seem more like petite. The dress is a nice dress but I would say it runs small. Returning.
2.0,These glasses are NOT progressive. They are bifocals.
2.0,"This shirt was a big disappointment to me for a couple of major reasons.<br /><br />First, I am 6'1"", 173 lbs, and medium muscular build.  Still, Size Small in this shirt is WAY BIG on me.  It fits nothing like the way it is shown on the model in the listing.  Mind you, my typical size is Medium, and I ordered a size down here, to be on the safe side for sizing.  It is still way too big.  Big time fail.<br /><br />Second, this shirt looks and feels like polyester, not cotton.  I am saying no way it's 95% cotton.  I know cotton, and this is not cotton.  Maybe you are ok with a polyester shirt, but I really like cotton.<br /><br />Given the two big disappointments, I am not a fan of this shirt.  It's not a terrible look, but it's nothing like shown, the sizing is way off, and it's made of polyester, in my opinion.  So, I feel like I'm being generous in giving it 2 stars.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it's still not a bad shirt.  It's just not what I expected."
2.0,"The charms are absolutely beautiful, but most of them were broken and the ones that aren’t broken started falling off the croc shoes I have after only being on for one day. I have another set of charms that I purchased on Amazon that are much better quality."
2.0,Stitching on gold bands are off. It does not lay on the shoulders. Color is red not wine red
2.0,"Pretty, but one of the lines snapped & broke after wearing a few hours. I tied it up & it still worked.."
2.0,The ear wrap did not fit my ear. It was too small. This is not an issue I expected to encounter/
2.0,Very light weight . Quality not so great but good for a run to market and errands.
2.0,"Too thin for winter wear which is why I wanted them. Color was great,  fit a little small. Appear to be of good quality.  Just not for my need."
2.0,Try too get sixes  more accurate. I wear 2x & 3x  your 4x should not be smaller then that
2.0,After a few weeks the strap broke. Everything else is great.
2.0,Nose grip is serrated just like a plastic knife. Very light weight. Lenses are clear but the discomfort from the serrated nose grip ruins the product. In my opinion a serrated nose grip has the potential to damage the delicate skin of the nose.
2.0,"Cheap, thin fabric. Wished the fabric was nicer as the plaid is lovely."
2.0,To thick to place in the nose
2.0,Not for girls with big calves
2.0,"This is not 100% cotton by any stretch. They need to change the product description. It feels more polyester than anything else. The colors are nice but the print looks off like you can tell they faked the worn look but its kinda cheesy.<br /><br />Fit is all off, boxy and way too tight through the chest and shoulders.<br /><br />I do not recommend."
2.0,I could have liked these pants but the sizes are way off. Large in the waist and tight in the butt and thigh. I couldn't even get them up.
2.0,"2 stars b/c the stone looks nice. it is really heavy and chunky. if you look at the photo thats exactly how you get it, that's the actual size of it. don't think b/c it is a ring you'll get it in a smaller size b/c those were my thoughts. it is huge."
2.0,Buttons fell off after 1st time wearing it:(
2.0,Size not plus size sick of that happening with your products that you sell love print and color and the material never true sizing like you say not buying any more
2.0,"Received wrong size. I ordered a small but got large instead. Very disappointing because I’m a petite woman who had to wear this to the Super Bowl. The shirt is neat, quality control...not so much."
2.0,"The fit is unlike the other GV jeans I have purchased, I have 2 other pair - one black, one dark blue that fit beautifully. Rather than being slimming these light blue jeans from Amazon make my lower tummy appear bloated. This along with the sticker discoloration makes me very unhappy with these light blue jeans. But I needed a pair of jeans that fit, I have lost 30 lbs and had no other choice but to wear them.  There was no time to return them.  I am wearing them today too."
2.0,Runs small. Had to return. Size up unless you want to look like a half opened can of biscuits
2.0,"I really wanted to like this sweater. The cut is cute and it fits the way I expected it to, but the fabric is horrible. Not stretchy at all like in the description and it is super clingy! Almost like Velcro, it sticks to itself and whatever I am wearing underneath, leaving it looking bunched up and not flowy at all. I'm really disappointed in this cardigan."
2.0,"Not sure if I will keep it, it is great looking BUT I have had it only 3 days and already my keys have came off the clip twice. If they come off one more time that will be strike 3 and it will go back. This a edit!!! Keys fell off again so that's the 3rd strike it's gong back"
2.0,would advise to size up...had to return.
2.0,It’s good for winter. Awesome
2.0,"Bought this as it said made in USA and price point was good. Attractive.  Unfortunately it started wearing down after 2 months.  Five months later I’m done with it.  The insides are falling apart.  Worse that that, there is adhesive residue that is coating a few of my credit cards now from the inside part of the wallet breaking down.  Normal every day use from me.  Would not recommend buying."
2.0,"Unfortunatly I waited too long to return.  I wear an XL shirt, and have a 40D bra so I ordered the 1XL tanks.  They don't cover my boobs, on the sides I see my bra a lot! I would def go up at least 2 sizes when ordering."
2.0,"As a LuLaRoe addict I wanted to love these leggings so much, especially since you can't find brown/khaki colored solids in LLR. All the reviews were amazing so I ordered 4 pairs. No go for me. I am a size 6 and LuLaRoe One Size leggings fit me perfectly. But these leggings were loose and baggy around my knees and calves. I do have skinny calves, but this was a full-on elephant knee situation. I've never had that problem with LLR, and it surprised me. It wasn't just one pair cut too large or anything like that. All 4 pairs I ordered were cut the same and I had to send them back.<br />These could probably be great if you have bigger calves, but if you happen to have smaller legs you will be sad. :("
2.0,Memeory foam isn't the greatest and the bottoms of them really hard and you can feel them through the memory foam.
2.0,"Very cute, and she loves the pockets. However,  the button fell off before the end of the 1st wear."
2.0,I don’t like it. Don’t recommend it.
2.0,The size was not as expected
2.0,too big for hat size
2.0,don't like what they have done to the knees
2.0,"These rings rust and turn your fingers green. The whole ring tarnishes after just a week. They lied about being silver, they are very cute though."
2.0,Top did not fit at all!!! Idek who has titties that properly fit in it
2.0,this is a top you will want to cuddle up with and never take off will become your favorites
2.0,Cute but the cross was crooked.
2.0,Unfortunately these are not a good replacement for the real thing. They are constantly popping off. Doesn’t help that my son is already reluctant to wear his glasses.
2.0,"Too small, good for child's party"
2.0,"Fit was good. But loose. Ordered a medium. I’m 5’7”, 145. Small would’ve been ok, I think. BUT... these things attract lint and fuzzies like crazy. I ordered black and every little thing ended up on these pants. The fabric is awful. Will be returning. Bummed because I like the fit :(."
2.0,Loved the color and style but the clasp it has to keep it tight is constantly loosening so I was always having to tighten it.  It became annoying so I changed to another band.
2.0,"Pros:<br />- belt does look really nice<br />- looks like it’s worth more than $10<br /><br />[Serious] Cons:<br />Note that this belt is *elastic*.<br />It turns out that it’s naturally very short in length, and STRETCHES [when pulled] to about 105cm (41 inches). It’s not 105cm unless you stretch it all the way out.<br /><br />This has so far proven to be impractical, as pulling and stretching the belt around my waist (while wearing pants) only causes the pants’ waist area to “bunch up” and wrinkle. Without stretching the belt, and thus just buckling it at its normal, unstretched length, it’s a very small belt that is just barely able to wrap around my 33-34” waist and buckle. This makes it look like I’m wearing a boy’s belt.<br /><br />So I either have to stretch the belt to fit me and have my pants look like I’m wearing a potato sack. Or I can just buckle it normally and look like I’m shopping in the Boy’s section at Walmart. 🤷‍♂️<br /><br />Ultimately, I regret buying this belt. :-/<br />Not what I expected."
2.0,"Cute bag but not worth the money. Super cheap material the zippers get stuck all the time, one of the zipper pulls has broken off of mine even though I never used it."
2.0,"It’s nice but I bought a similar dress from other seller and the quality is better & softer.<br />It was not sewn correctly you can see there was a hole and in other parts they forgot to cut the extra fabric after sewing it, I cut it and looks fine now but I’ll have to take it to someone to fix it cause I don’t have a sewing machine to do it myself.<br />-Lucia"
2.0,5xl apparently means they just made it longer and not bigger. I got my husband a different one at 4xl and it fits better. Disappointed.
2.0,"Used these as glove liners while skiing at Park city, UT.  Temps 10-30 degrees F.  Did not help  keep my fingers warm at all. Also, they started to pill almost immediately.  Would not recommend these at all.  They feel very light weight compared to other silk liners I have had."
2.0,"Not the most flattering fit, yes they are overalls but the waist is a little high and the crotch rode high. So the fit was really off. I’m 5’1” and 115 lbs ( my usual size is a 2) The fabric reminds me of the 1970s polyester, can’t relive that."
2.0,"Cute design & different from other tragus earrings I've bought. The problem with these are if you lose one of the balls, good luck finding it & screwing it back on. That's what happened to me. It's impossible to get back on...unless you have the fingers of a 6yr old. I asked my 13yr old granddaughter to help & she couldnt get them on. I gave up. I now have 6 pair of earrings I can't wear. I don't know how I even got them on!<br />It's disappointing bc I was excited about wearing them."
2.0,There were supposed to be 2 in the package but there was only 1.
2.0,"Very disappointing singers mask. Unlike the singer's mask I had purchased previously, this mask has no support to hold the mask away from your face while singing. Not worth the money for a singer."
2.0,The shoes were super cute but run about a size too large. I didn't want to take the chance of having to return more than once so I just returned them.
2.0,"The clasp holding it shut is getting loose but other than that, made with a solid material.<br />-<br />Update: dropped once from one and a half feet and the clasp broke."
2.0,"Great idea, poor execution. Size and proportions are an issue."
2.0,"The sweater was huge, which normally I don't mind, but it was beyond my acceptance range.  Worse though, the turtleneck instead of folding over on the outside, was flipped over on the inside and sewn down.  Kind of like a mock turtle neck.  I've never seen any thing like it and it makes me assume it was a total mistake.<br />If it was less expensive...a lot less, I'd consider keeping it or returning it for a smaller size.  Now I'm dubious."
2.0,The item was disappointing to me because it was thinner than the picture you showed
2.0,Extremely tight in the top and like a tent everywhere else. Highly disappointed
2.0,Very see through sent back
2.0,Dress is not at all as pictured. Totally different style and color.
2.0,The size is too large and I can't wear them - what can I do?
2.0,Fabric too thin and shear
2.0,"The sleeves on this dress were entirely too tight.  The rest of the dress fit perfectly.  I do not have large arms, but couldn't pull the bandage over my bicep.  It's a great dress, made of good quality, however, the arms are way too tight."
2.0,The dress is very nice but is too long. I am 5'1 tall and with heels on this dress was still long.
2.0,Leather gloves but gauntlets are synthetic. This is not as described. For $10 they're fine but will not give a good review for a product with deceptive descriptions or where the item does not match the photo.
2.0,"Pattern and cut are cute, unfortunately it is made out of a cheap, stretchy polyester. Fabric feels weird and has an unflattering drape and shine to it."
2.0,DONT LIKE THE FIT
2.0,The skirt is cute but it's shorter than expected and the zipper keeps getting stuck.  The picture looks mostly purple but it's actually mostly yellow with purple designs.  The belt isn't well made either but I guess that's what I get for the low price I paid.
2.0,It rides up.
2.0,Not what is shown.  Has a Velcro back. I was hoping for the metal clasp back.
2.0,Served its purpose for all of 6 super careful months. Then the clasp started to come undone and I finally bought my husband a BETTER wallet.
2.0,Overall they are pretty but these two came “broken” the purple has the little gem in there but the pink doesn’t? I feel as if I wasted money on junk🤷‍♂️ The blue one is the only one that is fine…
2.0,The polarization leaves something to be desired.  I find myself still squinting from sun glare.
2.0,"My Husband is 6ft 195lbs.<br />The is was a replacement for his Versa. On the last hole, it is too tight. This band is a full inch shorter than the one that came with the device.<br />Product shipped quickly and well wrapped."
2.0,"Earrings are super cute, but have only worn them once and the back clasp already broke off. Size and sparkle were great, but metal is very low quality."
2.0,Size is off. Two long to lay over neck like an open tie and too short to wrap around your neck in today's popular styles without the ends sticking out. Ugh!<br />Colors are hard to pair with anything but black. Tones are strange.
2.0,"nice material,  bot only 8 pouches on apron, not 12."
2.0,"When I first got it looked nice, after the first wash.. it shrunk. A large would be good for a medium size person.. and if you want it to run a little loose after washing, I would definitely suggest a large.."
2.0,My youngest daughter loves Dolphins and she loved ththis item when she received it
2.0,The band is cute but very difficult to put on and it has white stitching that stands out  and it looks like a 5 yr old did the stitching.  Making the band look cheap and messy.
2.0,I wish I’d read the reviews before purchasing.  I got this for my son who is barely a medium and it was too small.  I washed it once and now it just fits my daughter who is a small.  I wasn’t really impressed with the quality of the logo either.
2.0,"I ordered this 2-pack to make embroidered shirts for my son. Upon first glance they looked fine. I like that the material has some spandex in it so it has a little stretch and the seams looked good. The material looked good. Nice thickness.<br /><br />However, I noticed one shirt was off when folding it. I measured it and the shoulder line was half an inch longer on one side than the other. Then when I started looking more closely I found some other flaws. One shirt had a pinched stitch at the collar, which will be noticeable so that's not great.<br /><br />So one shirt was fine, and one was wonky. Not ideal."
2.0,"Item arrived on time and as pictured. The overall quality of the item is horrible. I placed the head band in the morning and was adjusting the position, while adjusting the headband it popped. I was not able to fix it since it split into several components. Therefore only buy this item if you are willing to use it once, and once it's place leave it alone otherwise you will be unsatisfied. It is a pretty headband, but its longevity is lacking. I have purchased other headbands online and have lasted me a long time and for a cheaper price."
2.0,"Turned my finger brown.<br /> Had a ""gaudy"" look ... not at all what I expected"
2.0,I've had two previous glasses from this company and maybe I got a bad pair this time but the left lens kept popping out when I tried to clean it
2.0,Cheep band did not last long.
2.0,"The top hardly covered anything, and i got the size that normally fits"
2.0,I had to order a couple sizes up that what I would normally wear. Looked cheaply made up close. Kind of a poor design.
2.0,Leggings are fine but the waist band is just one thick piece of elastic that digs in on top. Not a fan.
2.0,They’re cute socks but aren’t compression socks.
2.0,Beautiful dress but it's very long and the material is heavy for a cover-up. Seems like it would be hot.
2.0,"These neck gaiters have a chemical odor, even after washing. They also don’t stay up on the face very well. Definitely not a COVID safe mask. Probably okay for bike riding - just not near crowds. Overall disappointed with the quality."
2.0,"Very comfortable, good if walking on a smooth surface.  For a public  cement pool, surface was too rough and bottom is wearing out after about 5 uses.  I walk for 30-60 min in a current channel, against the current on cement.  If ordering, order a size smaller... Don't want extra fabric to catch water while walking, they will stretch."
2.0,I got these for my partner and me because we are back in the rock climbing gym and wanted more breathable masks. They were easy to put on/wear and it mayyyy bring in oxygen easier- those are the only positives. It is SO HOT and doubles the humidity inside. It was not possible to work out in and made us both lightheaded because it seemed like it was stuffed with our CO2. These masks have become our back-up back-up masks. I would not recommend this for exercise AT ALL.
2.0,Dress had so much potential. The shape and style are cute and flattering however the quality is horrible. Very thin and cheap material. Almost like what you would buy at a costume store: will he returning not worth $40. U can find a similar dress for less than half that price elsewhere.
2.0,"They look cute... if you could actually get the ball in... i used two needle nose pliers and another person but still no luck... after about a painful hour of trying the little ball fell out of my hand and was lost forever....<br />but if you are willing to take the chance they so seem to be good quality... if so, good luck... you will need it"
2.0,For the money these slippers aren't very good!! The sole is too stiff for the loosey-goosey fit of the shoe. Way over priced given the poor design.
2.0,Does not look as displayed online. Fabric was disappointing.
2.0,"Stiff material, does not drape as shown"
2.0,After first two washes it already has holes in the seems
2.0,broke after 1 week
2.0,Too short for me. Not by a lot but I can’t wear them. Nice quality material. Such a bummer they’re not long enough. Wah! 5’7 134lb usually size 2-4
2.0,I have purchased this band twice and each time I've caught the band on something and torn the silicone. Very disappointed because I love the design.
2.0,Wearable but barely. Looks like a drunk three year old sewed it.
2.0,The gloves bunched up around the little finger. And the fingers felt tight.
2.0,"I like the band.  It's flexible.  It doesn't grab the hairs on my arms.  It's stylish.  It just won't stay closed!  My watch has fallen off several times in the week that I've had this band on.  If I could figure out a way to make it stayed closed I'd keep the band.  It seems to pop open at random times.  It's not like I'm catching it things.  It just pops open and then the watch falls off.  For that reason, I'm returning it."
2.0,CRAP Quality! Don;t waste your money
2.0,Quality and feel is great.  Bought a big and tall size and the fit was not even close to other shirts in the same size.  I would need to order at least 2 sizes larger for it to fit correctly.
2.0,"Like the look of the watch. Dainty and nice color. However, the bands that keep it wrapped down keep sliding and so extra band width flaps."
2.0,Too stiff & too large for me. Handles are so small they are hard to  have over my arm. Too dressy for my everyday casual use. Beautiful color.
2.0,This really doesn't look as it does on the model. It is not form fitting at any place on the body especially if you have a small bust. I'm 5'7 and 120 pds and the small needed to be adjusted because it was way too big on me and the seam was way off on my left side. This item runs larger than expected
2.0,"Shirt was too small. I thought it was a cotton shirt but it was polyester, and it was not a ""true"" puff sleeve."
2.0,A little smaller than expected but beautiful dress and good quality- I would but it again but a size larger
2.0,I thought I was getting sweatpants style shorts. These are the shirt thin. I normally wear a medium/large in bottoms and got a large and the waist is SOOOOO tight it feels like it could be a small or xsmall on the waist. They are a good length and pretty cute but I'm not able to wear them. Shipping also took a long time.
2.0,Not all the bracelets would keep the snap buttons in securly (buttons would fall out of bracelets. Due to not being able to click into bracelet tightly.)
2.0,looks good but size is off
2.0,"Kind of bulky, looks cheap and turned my skin green."
2.0,Cheaper quality than I was expecting.  It's ok.  Will work for the beach
2.0,Purchased on Febuary 11 and breaking at the post by April 6. Not impressed with it's durability even though it looked nice when it arrived.
2.0,Tighten straps and Velcro is beyond matting material
2.0,They're comfy but.... not opaque.
2.0,my Wife loved that the material stretched but her torso was too short.<br />To wear the dress for a perfect fit She had to pull the front up high and the back went super long.<br />For the price not worth alterations which would have cost 40$ plus making this dress a total fail and not worth the price !
2.0,"This is just a weird piece. The pockets sit pretty far back even though I ordered up a size. If you put anything in the pocket (like a cell phone), it sags and pulls the shoulders all out of position. Bleh. The sleeves also fit a little tighter than I'd hoped."
2.0,Get what you pay for.  This watch does not keep good time.
2.0,"The calf part of the shoe is HUGE. Granted, I only bought these shoes for a play, but I had to cut them and tie them with string to make sure they didnt fall off or slouch on my calves. Not worth the $15."
2.0,not &#34;long&#34; as stated or not long enough perhaps
2.0,"I liked the style , but it seems to run small."
2.0,"Too big, not as shown in the picture,  and i ordered the gold one"
2.0,The skirt is cute on it’s own but im missing the red chain. I bought it for a specific outfit for a music festival so it was very disappointing.
2.0,Returned. Costume clothing
2.0,I tried both Large (recommended for my size) and Medium and both do not offer enough support for 'high impact workout'.
2.0,Material used is of low quality.
2.0,Low quality even though design is pretty
2.0,"Warning:  Do not go based on the measurements from the size chart.  Based on the size chart, my bust was for an XL.  I just received the dress and tried it on, the dress literally danced on me.  Based on the way it fell on me, I could have easily gotten away with order a medium in this dress.  It's stretchy material, so for us curvy girls, we don't need to go as big as we think.  Not sure how it would have looked if it would have fit, so this review is just based on the wrong sizing."
2.0,"It's pretty but so short it fits almost like a choker which is not what I wanted. I didn't measure it before returning so I'm not sure if it was was 19.5"" as described."
2.0,Not the greatest quality. Sent them back. They arrived tarnished.
2.0,Too small and I didn't like it at all
2.0,The ring had changed colors before we got it. My daughter thought it was cute but we should have looked further and spent more money on a better quality ring.
2.0,"Fit as expected, just kinda uglier than expected."
2.0,"This watch is beautiful and fits nice,but it quit only after a couple months."
2.0,"I bought these for my daughters who promoted form the 8th grade. Unfortunately they are a bit tacky looking, my girls still liked them but I was hoping they would be more like a charm bracelet but were more bulky than I expected."
2.0,Shoes are very nice looking but extremely narrow and could not wear them.
2.0,Fit is several sizes too small.
2.0,This produce it much lower quality than I anticipated even for a lower cost item. I was disappointed in it. I meant to return it but missed the deadline. Also the size is definitely smaller than anticipated. Very stretchy and the lining is very cheap.
2.0,"Beautiful dress, but runs really small.  I ended get 2 sizes to fit."
2.0,"Took over a month to get it in. Got lost. Made it just in time but the color did not match the blue in the picture. It was just off, lighter than shown.  Did like the magnetic closure and optional chain strap."
2.0,"I'm only giving two Stars because I received compliments the first time I wore it. But that was also the last time. The bag is so cheap, the chain popped in 3 sections the first wear. The snap in the front also displaced in 1 wear. Never again."
2.0,This did not fit as expected. I have big boobs.. 36DD.. got an XL because I don't like it too clingy. I'm 5'9&#34;... 175 lbs. This was so tight on my chest and barely covered my butt.  Sadly I'll be sending it back.
2.0,Beautiful but broke twice I fixed 1st time 2nd time not fixable weak links at clasp
2.0,Really cute but do not stretch at all so if your toddler has chubby feet this isn’t the sandal for them
2.0,"I ordered this dress in 2 sizes to compare, and in hopes that one of them would work.  I sent both back.  Didn't fit well, and appeared ""cheap.""  I was disappointed,  because the lavender color is beautiful."
2.0,Way too small and uncomfortable arm seams.
2.0,"Looked like they were dipped in cheap blue paint, not a patina. Most flaked off shortly after my wife tried to wear them. They look extremely cheap."
2.0,"I left them in strong lifgt for several days, but they were still hard to see, if at all, when I decorated with them"
2.0,"This clutch was exactly what I was looking for, simple with a small amount of glitz. The size was great, inside and out. Problem: this bag had only a small sliver of a moon of rhinestones and yet at least two were missing.  I've seen whole bags covered in rhinestones without this problem. It was just too obvious and had to go back.  What a shame. There are two magnetic clasps, one on either side of bag. They were a bit difficult to pry open, but I could have lived with that."
2.0,The strap is too long and wrinkled
2.0,"After a week of wearing this &#34;stainless steel&#34; trident, the forked top has already begun to turn color. The threading inside inside is horrible. It's nearly fallen off twice and now it won't screw on at all. Though this is exactly what I was looking for, the product is horrible and not as advertised."
2.0,The clasp is too small.  I cant get it on yet
2.0,They were smooshed flat once they arrived here
2.0,"Cute enough, but broke with in hours of wearing"
2.0,"I asked for this as a gift via my Amazon wishlist and requested an XL according to the size chart. According to the chart, 24&#34; might have been snug. The hat I received is tagged 7-5/8 is WAY too big! In the process of returning."
2.0,I like everything about this wallet except it will not clip shut. I thought maybe I had to much in it so I removed a lot and still won't clasp shut. Hence the two stars.
2.0,Uncomfortable and not stretchy enough and not wide enough
2.0,The only reason I rated it as a two was because I don't know how to take the links out and it don't come with instructions to take links out for it to fit my wrist. Also what is that card and plastic that they sent me and Japanese Korean or whatever it is. Please send me the instructions for taking the links out
2.0,"Fabric, style and colors are great. The zipper is terrible, very thin, very weak, got stuck, really stuck on first use. Zipper does not go back together well and zips on the left like a woman's garment, I checked my order thinking I made a mistake but I did order a mans suit. I would no recommend anyone take a chance on this item."
2.0,These are extremely lightweight and cheap looking.
2.0,Just got the costume and it's missing one of the buttons :( Might return the costume.
2.0,"hem of legs are uneven ,size is bigger than chart on web site."
2.0,"This cardigan was well made but it must have been miss sized. I bought it for myself, I usually wear a large, but sized up. It fit like a second skin. My daughter usually wears a small, she tried it on and it fit her but she did not want charcoal grey. We returned it.  Too bad. I would have liked to have it."
2.0,Cute but too small - a very tight fit. I give give it away as a gift.
2.0,the quality is not good. the price is very low so that was kind of expected i guess but i wouldn't recommend just because it would not be very hard at all to just snap these. they're a very fragile metal and bend and break easily.
2.0,"i liked the style of this dress, but it wasn’t what it seemed when i received it. it fit my body fine, but the split was wide and awkward and did not match the picture. i also did not like the inside fabric. this dress style is good for a summer night out, but the inside fabric was as if it’s cold outside. the fabric would be nice in a pair of leggings for the fall/winter. it was cheap. i will be returning."
2.0,First time I put them on one of the posts bent and broke when I tried to straighten it.  Threw the pair in the trash.  Hope the same thing does not happen to the second pair.  -disappointed-
2.0,very thin material and way too small. This was more of a kids L than a mens small
2.0,"They started changing color after wearing them an hour and turning my fingers green. Look really cool if you're using them temporarily, but don't count on them to last."
2.0,This jewelry is very deceiving. I purchased for myself. I wish the description of this product was describe as plastic on strings.That is what I got. I will give to grand-daughter. In hand it looks and feels like kids dress-up jewelry. I will not purchase from them again.
2.0,Color is much more rust than cranberry red as shown.
2.0,"When I got it, it was missing one. That was the only bad thing."
2.0,Unless your 7 feet tall don’t buy these they are very long. Black one aren’t to bad
2.0,"These are such adorable socks! Alas, they are so very wide they fit like loose boots on my daughter's feet! Yes, she has skinny legs but they are so so wide that it's the other extreme. These will only fit on chubby legs. I gave it 2 stars for the cute factor. I would have loved to keep it but she was able to step right out of them when they were on, that's how wide they are! Sorry, these are a no-go for me."
2.0,It breaks to easy! Every time I wear it. Someone says u dropped something
2.0,Flimsy and uncomfortable.
2.0,"I am 5'9&#34; and 145lbs. I normally wear a medium, but went up to a large after reading some comments. Even the large was pretty tight and unflattering. The material was thick and stretchy though, so that was nice - I don't think a slip will be necessary with the right size skirt. Also the dusty pink skirt is more of a dark mauve in real life, so heads up."
2.0,"This coat says it's true to size, but I found it to be about 2 sizes too small.  Also, the fleece liner is only secured in a couple of places - this would be an awkward piece to put on and take off.  There are better options out there at a better price"
2.0,"I am a DJ, some of these broke off my face while playing and some of them in my pockets. (Skinny jeans). I was able to take care of some, but you have to really BE CAREFUL. The design of them and how the look is amazing but I’m just sad they all broke :(("
2.0,Order a men Large and my son is a 38/30 I should have went bigger.. looked like a little boys size
2.0,"I ordered this in an XXL. It was way too large. It did not fit like the picture at all. The sleeves are very long and the tie in the front sits directly under the breast area. If you have a long torso, this dress may work perfectly for you. I do not have along torso, so it sat at a weird place. I ended up returning it, sadly."
2.0,I like the dress and the bottom  fits ok but the top is really small around my chest and I don't have a big chest at all. So that seems a little out of proportion but it is a cute dress.
2.0,The sewing is not perfect...
2.0,I didn't like the fact that the opening on the top part was small thus I foresee problems fitting things in and taking them out. Thus my search for a bag continues till I find another one.
2.0,"I'm 5'2"" 118 lbs.  Way too long. Cheap material.  Reminded me of a graduation gown."
2.0,I bought M. It is way too large  and I think it is plus size L
2.0,"Spend a little more for sport socks. These have that cheap dress sock feel that make my feet sweat and feel like they are sweating... and no, I don't have super sweaty feet.."
2.0,"'Stiff' case maybe, not hard. Not rigid at the zipper or hinge, the top of the case will just fold into the bottom and crush your glasses if any weight is applied. I wouldn't trust this to protect my glasses, especially glasses with larger frames/sunglasses that fill the internal volume."
2.0,I have chicken legs and just by trying this on they were ripped instantly. I mean I can sew them back together but the point is I spent money on something that shouldn’t rip the instant I try them on.
2.0,Cute but fit kinda weird
2.0,Too thin and light weight and also scratchy so I returned them and paid shipping
2.0,I ordered a 3 x. The material is very thin. Very little support for the girls. The padding shown through the tee shirt and over all ill-fitted. Not the comfort bra for me.
2.0,Not made so well
2.0,Toooooooooo long. Even with heels on was too long
2.0,I was so excited for these. They look great got a lot of complements and after 3 times wearing them they cracked perfectly with the wood grain. Super disappointed. I assumed they would be better quality for the price.
2.0,"My 8yr son loved this band for his Fitbit, but broke quickly. He saved up his own money to buy a 5pk, i discouraged purchase but he loves them."
2.0,This material is really terrible.
2.0,Pretty. Not functional.
2.0,"I ordered these earrings as a gift and the same day it was given the red stone popped out.  The stone was not properly flushed well with setting and the prongs looked like they were not completely folded over.  My grandma did not get a chance to even try them on.  I was completely dissatisfied, and am in the process of returning them with Amazon.<br />Unfortunately, my grandma wants these earrings and I would have to see if I want to order another set:("
2.0,"Pretty earrings...  I always knew I was toxic, just didn't realize I was corrisive..."
2.0,The outfit was poorly sewn and falling apart. And my daughter had a terrible time keeping the ears on her head. Not worth the money we paid for it.
2.0,Led lights are not working on one shoe already.
2.0,does not fit as expected...
2.0,Would not buy again. My daughter wore maybe 3 times before the bracelet broke. My daughter asked for a mermaid bracelet for a long time. Very disappointing for the price!
2.0,"I wear a size 9, but after reading the reviews I went with the 10. It fits as a 9 should so it is hard to say really how it fit. Go up one size. These boots appear to be flat and I wouldn't have bought them if I new there is a 2 inch pad to the heal in the back. People who order flat boots want flat boots. I don't get this concept with the heal inside the boot. I wore them around the house for about an hour and they almost threw out my back. These are so weird. If you need the height, fine, but like I said, I expected pretty flat boots and these are not. I'm 5'8&#34; and I don't need the height. I'm writing this review for people that might not expect the height inside the boot. Also, I kind of knew they would be cheaply made by the price, and they did not let me know. I think they are made of felt or something similar. They &#34;unreal&#34; buckles are too unreal for words. I really would not recommend them at any price. Sorry."
2.0,"I ordered the blue and purple tie dye dress. The description was misleading having different percentages of cotton. The tag says 100% polyester. Wouldn't have ordered it if I had known that. The color itself is much more purple than blue and doesn't really look like the picture. There is barely any color other than purple. However, it is a very stretchy and soft material. It was comfortable enough to keep, but I was overall disappointed."
2.0,"Meh. This is the 2nd piece of Ross Simons jewelry I've bought and been disappointed with. It looks nice so far but this bracelet makes me itch and I stopped wearing it on account of that. It's supposed to be Sterling Silver. I'm skeptical. The first piece I bought from them was a gemstone ring that stones fell out of within a week. Based upon my experiences, I've concluded that Ross Simons sells poor quality product at premium prices."
2.0,It definitely wasn’t as nice as it looked. Not comfortable at all.
2.0,This white crop top in size large fits my 36 ddd(victorias secret) but i wish it was longer. Its a very thin fabric and loose under the bust so what length i do have rides up. I will wear it but i dont reccomend
2.0,"I will not order from this seller again.  The shirt is soft and sheer like the picture, but in the picture, it looks about the same length front and back, and in person, the back is much longer (covers my whole butt) and the front much shorter (just over my belt).  I usually wear size small, I ordered a medium and it's still pretty fitted.  Should have definitely ordered a large because it should fit loosely.  I'm concerned that it will shrink even more after a wash.  Plus it took very long to get the item.  This seller has lots of cute things (in pictures) but I will not take a chance again."
2.0,They are comfortable but hard to get on
2.0,I am 5'6 150lbs and I ordered a medium and it was too small  I wish I liked the dres.  The seams in the breat area are very prominant and does not lay well.
2.0,"These do not fit adult feet.  I bought these for my mom who wears a size 7 shoe.  Her toe and heel were at the ends of the bottom material, and the knitted portion was tight across the top.  I gave them to a 7 year old niece who they fit well."
2.0,"The watch face was too big for my wrist and I returned it.  I could not tell by the picture how big it was and when I received it and tried it on, I could not bend my wrist.  Other than that it was a pretty nice watch."
2.0,The dress fit well honestly but it is SO SHORT. Would never wear in public because my entire behind would be completely exposed.
2.0,"This shirt is way too big for me! I've bought several other Allegra K shirts and so I ordered my usual size based off the others I have but I should have gone a size down. Due to the size, the cutouts don't hit me correctly and the excess fabric makes me look bigger than I am. I use it for a sleep shirt now."
2.0,"Got the biggest size for smaller 11yr old, didn't fit. Oh well. Cute top though, wish it came a size bigger."
2.0,I had to throw this out because it got too close to my radiators and changed color.  Design is okay; not the greatest shade of blue/turquoise.  Fit as expected.  I do like all-cotton gowns and this is all-cotton.
2.0,Definitely run small! The white pair is see through!
2.0,"This product was described as a dress when in fact it's two pieces. The top does not fit well at all, very gaping under the arms. I returned it. The color would have been great though."
2.0,This cover is huge. I got the smallest size and I won't be able to use it for at least 6 months. Glad I only bought one. The material is stiffer than our other covers. I ended up buying a 6 pack of the Thirsty's covers in small size and those were perfect.
2.0,So my husband and I absolutely love the designs! The only thing is they're not as tight as we were hoping that they were going to be. All five face masks that we tried on are super loose fitting and hard to keep on the face. But if you're looking for a fancy scarf these are probably a good go.
2.0,Looks really cheap and is as loud as an 80s windbreaker.
2.0,The ribbon to tie it on came off.
2.0,These look better in photos. They're made from a very flimsy plastic. I will only use them when I am going somewhere that I don't care if anything happens to them.
2.0,They was really pretty but my ears are very sensitive to some metals. So I couldn't wear them all day.
2.0,"These r not wool knit they r cotton and barely cover your ankle, not my idea of crew socks. Also not warm... If u have a 9 or plus foot these will not fit!  😞"
2.0,"Was extremely uncomfortable. There were so many spots that irritated my skin from odd stitching or seams.  The fit was also a bit strange, I felt that instead of lifting and supporting the bra would squish and flatten."
2.0,"These pants are cute, but they fit like teeny tiny compression pants, so they're cut extremely small (about 11 in X 2= 24 in waistband, and about 25.5 in with stretch) with minimal stretch. They also smooshed my butt and were bizarrely tight on the crotch; I had a permanent wedgie wearing these... For reference, I usually wear an XS/0 in Target Women's clothing, and I ordered a S in the orange and purple... So SIZE UP.  **I think most of the positive reviews are for the older designs; these new ""updated"" designs are terrible. Will return ASAP.<br /><br />Other flaw: Why is the waistband so short? It doesn't really provide great tummy control because the waistband doesn't reach my slower stomach (and I'm 5 ft 2)... Also quite sheer. Definitely not squat-proof, especially if you actually sweat during your workout."
2.0,The sizing was all off compared to the other sizes. Way too small
2.0,Like the phrase but ring is low quality and abrasive on skin
2.0,Cute but Just wore 1 time and look do not recommend it
2.0,"Pretty skirt extender, but it's more royal blue than navy blue and it's not true to size, unless you want it to be extremely tight."
2.0,"I dunno, I've had it for about 3 weeks and I have had to adjust the time on it once and the date twice. Either it's slowing down already or the dial/adjuster is too easy to accidentally bump and change. Either it's not a solid design, or the parts used are subpar - either way it's not good news.<br /><br />So here's my dilemma - buy another cheap $20 watch and hope for the best, or break down and drop $50 like I should have. Do yourself a favor, don't get into the dilemma I'm in. Just go ahead and drop $50 - $60 for a better item - if you buy this one, you're in for a bad time.<br /><br />(Yeah, I went there.. Hah!)"
2.0,Loved this band when it arrived.  Sadly the gray finish seems to be rubbing off and it looks splotchy after only 2 months of wear.  Extremely disappointed.  It no longer has a sharp sophisticated look.  I will not replace this band or make another purchase from this manufacturer.
2.0,Not sure they're all stone and not plastic. Fall out of my ear when I'm sleeping.
2.0,"I can start off by saying that I really did like the fit of this shirt and I’m sad to be returning it, but I will not be ordering another one since the color was very different than the photo!! I attached a photo showing what I received vs the listing photo. I wanted the vintage faded look."
2.0,i am a large body small breasted woman .. i measure a 48 in a band size because i am wide but my boobs are small .. i measure a b size in cup ... so i purchased a 48 b and the band fit perfect but the cup was huge .. like my whole head fit in it
2.0,"The floral print was super cute and the fabric was soft, but that was where the positives end. The top portion of the jumper was too big while the bottom crotch area hung too low. It was vintage fitting, but not in an attractive way."
2.0,"I have them for a week and already stretched out so loose fall off. They are tinted but not truly polarized. They do come in abundance of lovely packing. A little box, glass case and bag. Would have liked more money out in glasses then all the packaging.I wanted to like these, but will be returning."
2.0,The shirt arrived on time but didn't fit. I normally wear a small but the reviews said that it ran small so I got a medium. It was too small and it was a strange color like someone had washed it with a red sock.
2.0,Product was the  size of a Large.  Was very sad there sizing was so off. I loved the coat and the quality.
2.0,"The glasses were actually white. Label on them said matte black. I needed them so kept, but my kids are making fun of my white sunglasses"
2.0,My Mother had cataract surgery and these seemed like the answer to the problem. She immediately lost the eye patch the doctor gave her on the way home so was wearing reading glasses which drive her nuts. These kinda helped but was so uncomfortable. The fit doesn’t lay comfortably against the eye and face. So it needs a redesign.
2.0,too big!!
2.0,"Too small, too tight and not easy to put on. Even with help they were too difficult to put on.<br />Unless you need some really tight compression the lighter weight, microfiber socks will get more wear with less effort."
2.0,a couple came broken
2.0,"Not as cute as I thought. And sorry ladies with a bustier chest, I know how badly you wish, maybeee if you got the biggest size, maybe just maybe you could squeeze into the top.. You can't. I'm a 36dd and it just wasn't going to happen (ordered xxl)."
2.0,"Such a cute swimsuit, but it doesn't fit right. The top exposes too much side boob. . . .I ordered a medium (I'm 5'7&#34;, 142lbs, 36B/Cbra) and it did fit perfectly, it's just the cut on the top is weird and doesn't cover enough for comfort! So darn cute otherwise though!<br /><br />SO. .. I really wanted this swimsuit so I decided to try a large and see if that made a difference. . nope. Top still not only exposed to much side boob but was not tight enough (straps were gaping loose). So definitely not a size issue, just an awkward cut issue. Bummed it didn't work."
2.0,I was excited to try these but I am highly disappointed. These are more like panty hose than socks. The material is very thin. As you walk the socks rolled down! It is a pain to keep rolling then back up every 30 seconds. If they had made them longer that problem might be prevented. Will not purchase again!
2.0,feels like a worn out  t-shirt
2.0,"Too small , barely can see when used , disappointed."
2.0,"Nice glasses, but not multifocal. Top to bottom, side to side same"
2.0,"I bought this hoping it would help with my posture, but honestly I couldn't keep it on long enough to figure out if it helps. There are abrasive seams everywhere with this shirt. It does compress, but in a blunt-force all-over kind of way rather than targeting specific areas. The zipper is terrible. There is a flap under the zipper that goes against your skin (nice idea), but it gets stuck in the zipper multiple times when you are zipping and unzipping. Very frustrating."
2.0,Overall okay though cheaply made.  Would have preferred one pair made well versus 4 pairs cheaply made.
2.0,"Very cheap. I used for a couple days before buying something else. The zipper is cheap and started to come out. The slots for credit cards are too big and the cards will slide down, out of reach. Don't waste your money."
2.0,Terribly thin material. No body to it. Looks CHEAP! Wearable with a vest over it.
2.0,This I bought for gameday Saturdays.  It is very uncomfortable to where as my fingers are short and it is constantly pinching or something on my finger.
2.0,"The bill was way off-centered.  Too bad, because it's a good looking hat."
2.0,"Extremely hard to pull closed, too hard for my 11 year old. Strap that goes around and snaps is also poor quality and I don’t see it lasting long."
2.0,"Too big it's hurt my feets, not comfortable at all. WASTE OF MONEY."
2.0,"I like the material, the fit and how the dress flows. It seems as though the dress is make backwards. The seam is to the back and the pockets feel backwards as well. I will keep the dress for a house dress only.  I won't be purchasing another one."
2.0,"There was a hole in one of the socks, too. Pretty disappointing."
2.0,very cheap lookin
2.0,"very beautiful, but super small. if you have tiny tiny nipples I mean small like a 4 year olds pinky don't order they won't fit. they would be great for small non pierced nipples just pull your nipples through.if your nipples are average size and you want to see them turn purple then order away."
2.0,"pros: interesting, but clearly flawed design.<br />cons: made of thin leather; poor stitching. zipped pouches have two gaps where the zippers were not properly integrated into the wallet & small items will fall out; the middle part is stitching of two separate pouches. it's double stitched but a likely weak point.<br />overall this will do for now, but don't expect quality or a showpiece to show your friends.<br />I am looking to replace a wallet that lasted over 10 years of daily use and abuse. this item, S-ZONE Men's Vintage Crazy Horse, doesn't begin to measure up."
2.0,"The pants are exactly as shown in the photos and fit to size. I ordered these to wear to work, however, when they came in the fabric was extremely thin and hugs every curve of your legs/bottom. They clearly look like yoga pants and would not be acceptable in the business casual work environment."
2.0,"Adorable dress but was TINY. I always order an XL on amazon and it always fits me 9 times outta 10. This was literally so small it wouldn't even go past my head/shoulders. It was made for an infant. So unfortunately I will have to return. For refernce, I am 5' tall & 200 pounds, 38 DD and carry most of my weight in my mid section. Disappointing!"
2.0,I loved how this looked in photos and was just as cute in person but it was so short in the torso either the shorts were up my butt or the top was below my boobs which is crazy because I’m only 5ft. I also didn’t love the fabric it kinda felt like bathing suit material.
2.0,"Last time I got these they were perfect.  They are different now.  Much thinner, much less soft.  But the same price :("
2.0,Very beautiful but fell right apart the first day..<br />Was  never able to reassemble. Had bought another one that lasted a year before I broke the glass. It was fantastic while it lasted.
2.0,Love the dress but within one wearing (no washing) the hem came out of the arm seam and left a hole. Not a fan of the string that ties. It makes the dress look cheap. The style is super cute as well as the pattern.
2.0,"Seriously, dont take the smallest step up because your ass will basically fall out. Super cute otherwise!"
2.0,"This product works as promised and is simple to use. However it doesn't work for me, which is the reason for the two stars.<br /><br />While you can use this as a light meter, since the meters in current cameras are so good I'm assuming most people would want it as a flash meter. For this purpose it works pretty simply. You dial in the shutter speed and the ISO and arm it. When the flash goes off the display shows the aperture. And it works reasonably accurately. Not perfect but it will give you a good idea where you need to be.<br /><br />The problem is the pre-flash of my setup doesn't work with this light meter. Like much modern equipment, my camera and flashes use remote control. This makes using multiple lights a breeze since you can control each flash individually from the camera. And like most modern equipment my camera and flashes use a optical trigger. In this system the commander flash sends a beam of light with the information and the flashes then fire. This information flash, or pre-flash, is interpreted by the Sekonic as the flash itself. Consequently you get an absurdly wide aperture reading which gives you no help in determining the flash output. This might be an obvious point but I assumed the flash meter would ignore this very low beam and only trigger on a stronger flash, or even read two flashes if they occurred in rapid succession. This isn't the case at all. The meter reads the pre-flash and that's it.<br /><br />So I'm left with a flash meter which is of little use to me. I'd be happy to upgrade to a flash that did have this feature but there don't seem to be one available.<br /><br />EDIT: After writing this review I came up with a painless workaround: Use a very slow shutter and second curtain. The time delay between the pre-flash firing on first curtain and the flash firing on second curtain allows the Sekonic to reset and capture the flash. I went to as fast a shutter as 1/2 second. Might work at faster shutter. Further investigation wasn't worth bothering with since I could go to 4 seconds it wouldn't matter since I'm standing at the subject and not really taking a picture. All I care about is getting a flash meter reading. Funny in that I've seen a lot of long discussions about how to work around this problem but never saw this simple and seemingly failsafe solution. Maybe I'm missing something."
2.0,I sent it back. Too small.
2.0,They are nice but real heavy and the earrings keep trying to pull out of my ears.
2.0,"The material is rough, and the wire digs into my sides as though the cups were too small, but it simultaneously gaps at the top. Really painful to wear, but you get what you pay for, I guess"
2.0,While I love these earrings and they're super cute I've already lost 3 earring in less then a week. The earring backs on these earrings are the absolute worst. They seem to fit when you put them on but it's a lie. I literally had a pair in for 5 minutes and one of them fell into the drain as I was getting ready for work. It's such a shame but the earrings aren't worth the cost for the earrings and new earring backs
2.0,I get a (L)and I asked for a (s)
2.0,The size chart is way off on this item. A XXL is about a medium in USA sizes. Suit is made very well and the pattern is beautiful but is for very small women.
2.0,Quality is really poor.  Not what I expected.  Previous Amazon scarf purchases were great.
2.0,The material is soft and light weight; very thin and you can see through it easily. Some of the stitching from the buttons felt loose.
2.0,Comfortable but came up too high on my feet to wear with pumps
2.0,Cheaply made. Would not recommend.
2.0,Fits as a shirt not dress
2.0,"I carry my weight in my midsection.  This dress was not for me.  Sent back.  Unless you have a flat-ish stomach, I don't recommend."
2.0,"extremely small, hard to distinguish the bunny shape.I won't give them as a gift."
2.0,These are cute but very heavy. So heavy that they give me headaches.
2.0,I like that it has a front closure and it's pretty but doesn't support.
2.0,They run small and the fabric was very uncomfortable
2.0,Turned my belly button green did not enjoy that but is still cute
2.0,"The lenses are good but the frames are very cheap and flimsy. I like the shape and color, but i don’t anticipate they will last very long."
2.0,First use revealed a ripped seam - they did not compress down as I had expected
2.0,It’s really cute but falling apart at the seams along the arm and where the top is attached to the bottom half.
2.0,This is a slick material that would stick to your skin in heat. It does not look at pictured. I was shocked at the cheaply made shirt that arrived. Returned!!
2.0,"Soft, but after washing it once it is staticky and attracts fuzzies non stop. so sad."
2.0,"I bought these socks several months ago under the impression that they made from bamboo.  And several months ago, these socks were advertised as such: &quot;Galsang Women Bamboo Fiber Socks Soft Fall Crew Sock.&quot; I ran across these socks again and was surprised to see that they are no longer under the same product description--it even says cotton socks now!--and yet, according to the picture at least, the product is exactly the same. From what I can see in other reviews, there are others who were given the impression that they are bamboo also. So what is it really made out of? And why have I seen two different product descriptions within the span of a few months?<br /><br />As for the socks themselves: I think they are decent quality. They are thick and have held up well. But they're not breathable as bamboo socks are. When I was shopping for socks those many months ago, I was shopping exclusively for bamboo socks. No matter how nice a sock might be, I would not have bought these had I known they were cotton."
2.0,Very very thin straps and broke when my son was break dancing.
2.0,"Love the design and very good for the price but size down as you can see in the pictures my daughter wears size 12 little kids so I figured size up 13 for a growing kid. Now the blue boots are size 3 big kids!! Why are these pink boots ""size 12"" almost the same size as the size 3!! Neatness to say will have to return and probably get a size 10. Hope that works"
2.0,I really wanted to like this dress. From the other review pics it didn’t look see through.. the bottom half has a very sheer lining. The top doesn’t. That’s why it’s getting 2 stars. I wanted to buy more colors but won’t now.
2.0,Zipper gets stuck first day of wearing it. Unthreading began at the sleeves. Somewhat cheap material. Fits good in some parts and lacks in others. Seller did not contact me back when discussing the unthreading of the jacket + the stuck zipper. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,"Cute, but feels cheapy and is super super short. Not quite sure where you’d wear it"
2.0,Bulky and did not look as nice as expected
2.0,smaller than I thought it would be:(
2.0,The posts are so skinny that the backs fall off and I lose the earrings.  I have tried multiple backs and they all fall off.  I like them but they’re not functional if you can’t keep them on.
2.0,"My daughter who’s 11 said she heard about this mask that shows lips moving and silliness. I decided to buy it. First off, it’s wicked heavy. There’s no switch, so the instructions were outdated. It’s a button you press. There’s just no way you’d actually use this, except as a gag or at a party."
2.0,"The socks are cute, but the material is very thin.  I had large hole appear on the heal of one sock after wearing for less than 3 hours."
2.0,These are wayyyy too short and the material is not cashmere. The material is a lot heavier than I thought and I also didn't see in the description that there was a big slit (like 10-12 inches) up the pant leg.<br /><br />Very disappointed. I was looking forward to lounging in these...
2.0,These literally arrived with both lenses containing scratches and scuff marks. I'm sending them back...
2.0,"While this band is beautiful, and I wish it would work, the watch face of my smart watch (Samsung Gear S3) is too heavy for this band, to keep it from spinning, I have to make it tight, and the chain in thin and bites into the skin. Sadly I will be requesting a return."
2.0,Fit snug
2.0,Not true to size. Order up a size than your true size.
2.0,"I wanted these for a costume, but even for one night they are not comfortable! The material is super thin, and feels more like plastic than any type of fabric. They really aren’t flattering, and the patterns isn’t exactly the same as the picture (instead of having mirrored patterns on either pant leg, both pant legs have the same pattern in the same orientation, not a horrible difference, but still not what I bought). I knew it was a risk to buy such a cheap pair of sweatpants, and these just didn’t work."
2.0,Bra did not fit well for a plus sized person.  Bra cups had breasts standing at full attention and not a soft view.  My full figure flowed out of the bra and was unattractive.  I returned it.
2.0,Looks very fake.
2.0,"Very odd fit, pockets are pretty high up, like at the waist. Not what I expected"
2.0,"When i first got this I have it 5 start based on the way it looks; which i loved. But after using it the first time, the piece to cennected broke. Not too happy because i really love it and now I cant."
2.0,This blue is nothing like the bag. The bag is more of a real color not the sapphire blue in the picture.
2.0,"Silly me, I did not read the fine print<br />Only one keychain.<br />Box came Pretty smashed, but the key chain looked OK. Looks kind of cheap but my daughter is OK with it"
2.0,Cute idea but the one different fish🐠 in gold wore off in just the first week of wearing this ring. So no longer visually notable fish going the other direction😔
2.0,I am 5 foot 7.5 inches and 153 lbs.  The pants were way too short and too small.  Returned them.
2.0,"Fit a little large so I suggest to order a size smaller than normal size. Unfortunately, my son only wore his briefly twice before they broke."
2.0,":'poor quality very thin  like a paper. wife hand washed  and she put in the dryer  after drying it has a small hole on the front  yet she did not wear yet. wife  is not  happy.to much money for  this  thin pant, should lower the price  $9.00 is the best price for this poor quality product. not recommend this product."
2.0,"Although I am happy with the style of both hats but the black one is too ashy it looks like a charcoal instead of black... the ideal feature to these hats are that the criss cross in the back is elastic there for you can put your hair in a ponytail through any of them and it looks good it will just display your ponytail high or low whichever opening you use. So I gave it a low braiding due to the black hat really not being black on the material oh, that is the main hat that I was trying to purchase was glad that they had the black one and gray one together now this looks like I have two breads one dark gray one light gray."
2.0,"They are cute, but the captive ball was extremely difficult to get in. I got it to work with one ear and that took some time. Now I've had captive ball earrings in the past, but they weren't as difficult to get on as these. They are cute though. Just also wish the diamond was a little more prominent."
2.0,The hat is solid but both mittens began to unravel rendering them unwearable.
2.0,I don't get how this goes
2.0,"returned, just not for me. very big and plasticky looking"
2.0,I would have like more of the shapes from the advertised pictures
2.0,I liked the mask but the lens is super cheap I guess you get what you pay for.... autodarkening would be nice as well
2.0,Very difficult to correctly place.
2.0,"Ugh ok. So the compression is mostly great. HOWEVER, the split/butt flap thing in the back is super weird. I have big hips and the top part of the thing digs in around the back of my waist making an odd muffin top where there is none. The edging of that part is really hard. If I pull it down over my hips, I get a line around them, if I pull it up over my hips the weird back muffin top. So I cut the edging and it helped a little (also made the item unreturnable), but THEN I realized that it has a seam that goes across the back exactly where a panty line would be. The whole point of wearing these is to avoid panty lines. I bought it to wear under a catsuit and that line is like all you see. It goes across the butt and down either side of your pelvis. Like an odd thong line. I’ll eventually find something loose enough to wear over this, but that’s the opposite of what it’s supposed to do. Btw, the answer is not a bigger size. If it were bigger, it wouldn’t be supportive enough. It’s just made for a shorter waisted body type with less differential between waist and hips. I’m so sad. The search continues."
2.0,"They are see through. They r black and when you stretch them (your hips will stretch them) you can see the skin, underwear color, etc. Can't go out on this much less work out. Too bad :("
2.0,"Maybe it's just me, but I found this strap uncomfortable to wear. My chin was so stressed when I wore it that I could not get to sleep unless I remove it so I decided not to use it anymore"
2.0,Hardly worn and the shoe string popped out of the holder so can no longer tighten. The tongue keeps sliding to the side while being worn. I do like the footbed -has good grip.
2.0,The white is VERY see-through. I was hoping to wear it to work but even with beige undergarments it still is very see through. Guess I’ll just donate it.
2.0,Flimsy and the lens were scratched
2.0,They were more pink than they were red. Not what I expected.
2.0,These are kid size. It should be told before people order.
2.0,The shirt doesn't fit as loose as shown and the material is shiney...also not how pictured.
2.0,Soooo cute but also so cheap the entire pocket ripped open before i even wore them once definitely not worth the price but they are super cute
2.0,I got sent the wrong size so it is loose fitting even on the neck line but I was like whatever I will just keep it. Then the seam on one of the arms ripped. The only thing I like is the color.
2.0,It is not long like advertised!
2.0,I did not care for these. The balls are too small. I couldn't wear them.
2.0,Thet look good and seem to be good quality but are way to small hopefully one day I'll be abl to fit them LOL
2.0,"fits as expected, overal its cheap looking, can be used just as a beach dress. its ok, but do not expect anything special"
2.0,"These belts don't have much give to them, so they can feel quite restrictive and if you are curvy, they may not fit at all. They are pretty though."
2.0,"The shirt is excellent quality. Unfortunately I bought it for a costume and the hat and necklace are missing and it is too expensive to keep just for the shirt, no matter how much it fits. Super disappointed as now I won’t have my costume done in time."
2.0,Fell a part when I pulled one set off the card
2.0,"I know they're cheap but they are bad quality. Just bought another pair, same price, from Walmart and they are way better quality. They are too wide and kept falling off my face."
2.0,"Item arrived with deep cuts in the leather. I dont know if this is intentionally distressed or not, but its a bit extreme. Planning on returning this item."
2.0,I loved the colors of the dress.<br />But it's made really cheap.<br />It cave wrinkly and you can't iron it. It's very beautiful. But made too cheap.
2.0,"I got an XL for my 6' hubs, and it fit my skinny 5'4"" frame perfectly. He looked like the hulk in it. If you want this one, size up about four sizes 🙃"
2.0,The straps are easy to change and the fit well. But I thought they attached to the cover and slipped over my watch face. I was disappointed when I realized that it doesn’t slip over my watch face..
2.0,"This dress runs a little small, according to my measurements and measurements on the chart. Very disappointed in the sewing of this garment. A lot of loose strings, the sequins are crooked. Looks horrible! I would not recommend this garment!"
2.0,The sleeveless armholes are too big.
2.0,The print of these aprons are pretty however the aprons Bib is not wide enough and the strings are not long enough I could barely tie the apron in the back 👎🏽
2.0,Not very comfortable or warm
2.0,"Returned both sizes I ordered. Not enough bust support. Normally I'm a 6 in regular clothes at 5'7"" 135. I first ordered a 10 and it was too big. Ordered an 8 and the body fit perfect but the bust was just lacking. The purple color is very pretty and the roushing on the tummy is nice, just wish there was something different for the chest."
2.0,"Our bodies are all different, no matter your weight you are, and whatever ladies we cannot be smaller, unless you are not eating food products. I recommend ordering up 3 dress sizes."
2.0,"the fit was NOT so tite.  Problem with things manufactured in China is that<br />the clothes or shoes manufactured are made much too skimpy and not for the<br />American body or foot.  Unfortunately, the shoes are going back to Amazon.<br />I am very disappointed as I had high hopes for the shoe."
2.0,"I'm a size 30 and ordered true to size. The size 30 pants I received were incredibly large and loose fitting. When trying on the pants, I was able to fit both of my hands behind the inseam; there was even more room to spare beyond this, thanks to the elasticity of the fabric.<br />Even if the pants fit correctly, I'm not sure I would have kept them. Nowadays $30 is fairly cheap for a modest pair of pants - but I feel the quality of these pants to be a tad too low for even that price, which is why I ultimately returned the pair I ordered instead of exchange them.<br />I've ordered similar sets of pants from amazon before with varying results. These types of items can often be a roll of the dice; sometimes you don't know what level of quality you'll get. This time I found the result unfavorable, but your mileage may vary. Based on the fit that I received, I would recommend ordering a size or two below your normal fit."
2.0,Fits perfectly. I’m not too big a fan of the draw string but it works
2.0,Ordered this product and the wallet I recieved did not have a zipper or keychain as described.  Have to return.
2.0,"Minute hand is dark brown, can hardly see it."
2.0,"I love the dress, except that it was too short"
2.0,Was too small and I ordered a large . It would not go past my thighs .
2.0,"These jammies are so cute and soft, but the shirt is disproportionately small/tight. Shorts fit great though. Overall I’m disappointed."
2.0,And I bought it a size larger.
2.0,"I really wanted this shirt, but the xs was huge!!! Allegra K’a products used to fit so perfectly, but now I have 3 shirts that are so beautiful but too large :("
2.0,"Bought this for my chocolate lab in flag print. She’s 80lbs and has a big head and the M/L fit well. It looks good for the 5 seconds it stays unfolded in her neck, but only giving 2 stars because like other reviews said, all it does is roll up on itself in a matter of seconds and I’m constantly adjusting it. Was pretty disappointed in it overall and probably won’t buy again. I was going to consider buying the human version as a headband for running but will probably be looking elsewhere now. Save a couple bucks and just buy a bandana at the dollar store."
2.0,These ties are very thick.  Thicker than most men's ties.  They are very hard to put under a child's collar.  I would not buy them again.
2.0,Looked so much better in the ad. For me they leaked. Returned. Didn't like the straps either. But mostly it was the leaking and I didn't like the black.
2.0,really pretty but didn't last long. Tore apart!!
2.0,"I bought this for my son because he lost his only pair. When it came, my son took it to swimming, but the fun didn't last long, because the suction had no power at all. Very bad, please don't buy it."
2.0,The slit is very high up - as in when I walked you can see up the dress.  The shoulders fit very broadly.  Made my middle look very round.
2.0,Don't waste your money. Looks very cheap. Returning it.
2.0,Got a size large. The top is not fitted well at all. So cute but too much side boob. If you have a smaller chest then it will look great. Large chest girlies not so much.
2.0,WAY TOO BIG!
2.0,Too bulky for something called a &#34;mini&#34; wallet.
2.0,It’s thin material
2.0,"Definitely had a jabbawockeez phase like 8 years ago and I wanted to learn how to dance so I got these gloves to be like them. It fit well and did its job. It made me feel like a jabbawockee haha BUT it's very cheap quality though, and can easily rip, especially the seams on the fingertips. If you're looking for durability, this ain't it."
2.0,This necklace is much smaller than it appeared. It would be good for a child not an adult.
2.0,They’re so cute but they don’t fit a newborns head. I even waited for two months to see if they’d fit my baby’s head and they’re still too big.
2.0,See through. Flimsy! Cheap looking. Too small even using the size chart provided.
2.0,"I bought this as a birthday gift to a friend of mine. It was very pretty and she loved it but it didn't even last a year, the chain broke off twice and the turquoise part of the keychain has come off. It's been glued back together one time too many."
2.0,"The size listed was inaccurate, but they are otherwise as described."
2.0,"The reason for the low rating is that I have not been able to get it to work.  They say it uses a battery, but, is the battery included?<br />They say to open the back - How?<br /><br />Other than that, it is exactly the style I wanted."
2.0,El reloj se cargó durante toda la noche y la batería solo llegó al 83%
2.0,The glue on the sole didn't last for my daughter after 2 months it was loose.
2.0,Too small and zipper on side is not comfortable.
2.0,the size was no where near what it was supposed to be. it was way too small
2.0,Unfortunately the product is too big & you don’t really look genuine in it. Too bad it didn’t work for me.
2.0,I was really disappointed even for the price that the rhinestones were not centered in the hole correctly.
2.0,"Much larger than anticipated, and washing / drying did not shrink it- gave to a friend."
2.0,This onesie was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my niece. It was obviously designed to fit an Oompa Lloompa. No one is that short and that wide.
2.0,Dont see a guy wearing this. My wife bought it for her as it's more girly than for a guy. Most women have smaller wrists. Can only go so small without removing beads and then even still doesnt bend around the wrist right. Good concept looks nice but just isn't there all the way.
2.0,the link that attached the pendant to the necklace broke the same day it was received. love the pendant
2.0,Inconsistent texture and sizing.
2.0,The waist line is very high (and I am short-waisted)  and it was a large waistline
2.0,"I like the face, the style... although the current style is toward very large watches which are too unattractive on my small wrist. It is also VERY thick. doesn't fit easily under a shirt sleeve.  It was inexpensive, otherwise, I would return it. I WON'T  be wearing it!"
2.0,Doesn't stay on stomach slides up.
2.0,it was ok; had a little rip in it
2.0,I ordered a size 10/12. These are 10 inches shorter than my daughter's other 10/12 pants. I wish they had larger sizes- they are very cute and seem comfy but these would fit a 6 yr old...maybe.
2.0,"It LOOKS nice.  It feels super cheap.  Hoping they don't turn green... but expecting them to... lol<br />MUCH longer than shown in the photo.  The second leaf, when worn just like in photo, comes down past bra.<br />Will give a couple as gifts.<br /><br />UPDATE:  FIVE out of SIX of these necklaces do not lay right.  The chain is supposed to attach thru the BOTTOM of the leaf... all but one were near the TOP of the leaf and it just doesn't look right - at all.  Total disappointment.  Making this a TWO STAR review"
2.0,"My friend has one of these and loves it. I bought one and it only lasted about 4 months before it broke. It’s a nice item, but 4 months is not long and shouldn’t break in that short amount of time. Would buy it again, but worries about it’s durability."
2.0,"I like the designs and colors....but the sizing is all wrong for a tongue piercing. It's the same size as the original jewelry you get when the piercing is done, you know, before going back to get a shorter barbell. I tired switching the top part but it won't screw on to the barbell I have in."
2.0,They look nice but as a mask it will not stay up so basically useless.
2.0,"This jacket was too small for me. I was hoping for a lose fitting denim, but this is sized to fit. I returned it."
2.0,material feels like plastic. looks cheap
2.0,They need some work. They won't stay attached to your ear if u bend down.
2.0,"The sizing chart for these socks is wrong. They are labeled for 9-12, but they are closer to 4-6 year old socks."
2.0,"I'm a guy that has been riding for years. I ride with a straight back and seat slightly tilted down towards front to provide comfortable pressure where it matters. These bike pants have lots of padding, but in the wrong places. There is too much padding up high on the butt area and there seems to be a lack of it for the crotch and forward parts. This has the effect of putting pressure on the more sensitive parts and makes for uncomfortable riding. Unless you have a very upright or very rounded back riding position, where it is all your butt on the seat, I would not recommend these pants."
2.0,It fit perfectly but it wasn’t what I expected
2.0,"The only way I could make this work was by removing the underwire, even now, I'll lay out in it but I'm not going near water in it! It's a shame because it's really cute."
2.0,I do have to say I am a bit disappointed in my new sunglasses strap I recently purchased a pair of costa sunglasses  I’ve been wanting for a very long time and finally been able to get a pair...I do a lot of fishing so that’s why I wanted to get the strap to make sure I don’t lose them... I will say I am very happy with the overall look of the strap however my costa sunglasses are too wide wear the strap actually goes on basically the strap ends Do not stretch enough to fit the ends of the glasses if I work with it long enough I can get it on but it is quite a bit a hassle so unfortunately I’m already looking for a different type of strap...It does however fit my cheaper sunglasses so I will get some use out of it but not what I intended it for....I do wish this could be a better review  and thanks for checking in...
2.0,Lightweight and foldable but too small!
2.0,"Although this kimono looks nice, the sleeves are way tighter than they should be. It is wearable but would look much better with looser sleeves. Not what I expected."
2.0,"Quality of gloves is good, and shipping was quick, but the gloves (bought to protect my husband's normal-sized hands from skin tears due to blood thinners) were so small that he couldn't get his hands in them.  The ""one size fits all"" description is inaccurate and misleading."
2.0,Didn't stay on when my husband wore them.  Keep coming off the back of his foot.  Also very thin.
2.0,The fabric  quality is not what I expected.  It wrinkles badly through wash and dry maintenance.
2.0,They definitely aren’t waterproof.  Wore them all day in the rain and the water got through to my hands.  Hands were cold after just a few hours of wearing them.  Wouldn’t wear them in -30° temperatures if they can’t even keep my hands warm in +35° temps.
2.0,These gloves are pretty much impossible to put on a toddler’s hands. We finally gave up and bought a different pair. They ARE cute and seem to be well made. They just don’t fit well.
2.0,"The center stone was supposed to be blue, the one I recieved was clear."
2.0,"designed for women with small or no breast, I'll be giving it as a gift to a younger girl that is very tall"
2.0,Must shorter than it says!
2.0,"Although very attractive looking, the product seems to be extremely frail. Not strong"
2.0,There were NO directions included in the box when it arrived. I have been unable yo find any discernible instructions online or elsewhere so the watch cannot be set.
2.0,Horrible zippers<br />2 of them broke before ever wearing them.<br />Warmth is the only thing they have going for them.
2.0,The handles are going to rip out
2.0,I wasn't expecting a high end pair of sunglasses but these feel cheaply made and look like plastic
2.0,"Took a chance & bought these because of the price. The size is plus size, no specifics. Of course plus size does not fit all in the plus size category. These pants are on the smaller side of plus. They are about a size 12. I'm more of a 16/18. I'm going to give them to my daughter in law."
2.0,These were complet garbage. But I'm not sure why I expected much with such a low price. They have the quality of those star and heart shaped glasses we used to get in piñatas as a kid
2.0,Little Diamond fell off
2.0,The band width fit perfectly but the front is so tiny it doesn't cover. Don't know how I could ever wear it. Made for size A cup. Also the straps are a bit long and not adjustable. It's so beautiful in the back!! I so wish I could wear it.
2.0,"Too silky and thin, as if they were pajama pants.<br />Not what I was expecting"
2.0,The tip came off after wearing it 3 times.
2.0,Gave these to our granddaughter (4 years old) at Christmas.  They are already shredded up on the outside.  Did not hold up well at all.
2.0,Not happy with this piece not impressed not the same quality from NYC Sterling.
2.0,Very thin comfy but thin! Not good for going out side
2.0,Sweater was just what I was looking for but way oversized! I recommend going two sizes smaller.
2.0,Shirts were ripped on the side!
2.0,"The color and length are great--really beautiful.  I don't mind the thinness of the fabric, though I wish it was thicker and heavier.  The reason for my less than favorable rating is because of the delicacy and lack of durability of the fabric. It has pilled terribly after wearing it only 3-4 times, and not even a whole day on any of those occasions.  And this is before I've even needed to wash it!  I am very gentle on my clothes, and I line dry nearly everything I have. I do not have high hopes for this garment holding up well for washing, even with gentle care.  I tried to use a fabric de-fuzzer on it, and because the fabric is so thin and delicate, it got a small hole in it.  For the price, it's okay, as long as you're not going to make it a staple in your wardrobe and don't have great expectations.  I would not recommend this garment, nor would I purchase it again."
2.0,After a month -- splitting and stitching becoming undone.  Recommend PASSING on this one.
2.0,"Disappointed in colors. Received 2 green bands and no red. And, received the strap holders for bands that I did not receive."
2.0,"The ad is deceptive. It sounds like you get 2 , 2 packs. For 4 , its worth the $. For 2 , they are too expensive. And I ordered according to their size chart and they are uncomfortably small. Only good thing is my wife thinks I look hot!"
2.0,"Scratched very quickly, but had a very lightweight feel."
2.0,They are like granny panties - only worse.  Came halfway up my back!  Yuck!
2.0,"The pants seem like decent quality overall, but one of the front pockets has completely shredded. Seems to be some sort of defect in the pocket material. They had only been washed once."
2.0,"I expected the necklace to be longer and larger. The earrings are impossible to wear, the backs are so stiff. Do not recommend."
2.0,"The outside of this purse is a really pretty color and looks just like the picture. The only thing I am disappointed with is the lining inside the purse. The lining actually makes a crinkling noise when you touch it or when the purse moves. As if it is made of plastic. Seems cheap, not sure I would buy again. Wish I would have know before I bought it."
2.0,The quality is decent. Looks like the photo. But....<br />I now understand why they have a big girl as the hand model. These rings won't fit unless you are 250 pounds and/or have sausage fingers. The price is cheap but I'm really disappointed. I can't even give it away as a gift. Looks like I'll have to leave them at a local mcdonalds. See if anyone wants them.
2.0,"Recieved wrong color and size returning. It is thin fabric, not cute when stretched to thin."
2.0,These are big enough for a 4-5yr old definitely not a 2-3 year old.  Fits too big for their little faces.
2.0,"The size of the letter borders on almost ridiculously large. I still wear it, but it's not understated, by any means."
2.0,"I'm a big guy so I wear 3X. I got these, which I did like the looks of them, but when I tried them on they were very, very, very tight."
2.0,"The pair I got doesn't look quite like the picture. The upper is shallow and doesn't come back far enough on the foot enough, very hard to keep on. I really tried but I just can't walk without straining to keep them on my foot. I compared them to a similar pair I have and the uppers are over an inch shorter. Returning."
2.0,Wasn't what i wanted box was damaged tights are ugly gave them to my sister for art projects
2.0,"I liked these gloves when I first got them and the touch-screen fingertips worked great . . . for about 2 weeks.  After that, I would try and try and try to unlock my iPhone by swiping my finger across (tried both hands, fingers and thumbs) and got nowhere.  Then I had to go back to taking my gloves off to use my phone, which wasn't fun during a freezing Midwest winter.  I won't buy these again and will most likely donate them to a charity."
2.0,"This is a beautiful dress, but only on the picture on the add! I didn't wear it, but it was so huge for a small.<br />The fabric was heavy and seemed kinda rough, there were several threads noticeably sticking out form the dress.<br />I don't mean to be harsh, typically if I don't like something I won't mind writing a review and just let it go, but this was bad :/<br />I'm glad Amazon is very flexible and with the return and refund there was no problem."
2.0,Feels cheap and fits too tight . Ehh.
2.0,The dip/shape in the back is super awkward and distracting. So it the material.
2.0,its cute but way too difficult to close
2.0,It looks so cheap. It’s still hanging on n my closet. I will never wear this top. I’m putting it in my donate bag
2.0,The pants are sorta tight (fit like leggings) and the shirt is huge. The material is VERY thin and feels VERY cheap!
2.0,I ordered the  Back-gray print size small. Color and print was nice but:<br />1: just a big piece of polyester fabric with a tie<br />2: does not drape or fall right at all and looked awful  because of it<br />3: you would have to pin it closed somehow in case of wind<br />Returned and would not recommend.
2.0,Super super high waisted and not as cute in person as the picture
2.0,"These masks are very thin. Like a VERY thin tee-shirt material. The fabric rolls/curls up and stretches along the cut edges. Pretty loose.<br />Because of this, you can breathe thru it relatively easily as they are so loose and thin. However, what makes it comfortable is what makes it ineffective as protection."
2.0,"The shoes were adorable and light weight but fit about a size smaller than what my son normally wears. The material came apart easily and the Velcro stopped sticking after a couple days. This shoe would be okay if worn on occasion, granted you get a bigger size, but every day wear for these is terrible."
2.0,The posts are  too  short and the post locks are too small for adult fingers to manipulate.  These may be better sized for a child.
2.0,The shoes are wide and wear out quickly.
2.0,Not stretch at all! My girl is not super skinny but not chunky at all! She fit in it but not comfortable. I washed once and washed terrible! Do not recommend. The design is pretty if you only want to wear it once
2.0,Demasiado pequeño 🥹
2.0,"The Sling Bag seems great, except for one ""little"" detail that made it unusable: it was just too small.  It was too small for both myself (I wear a Man's Large shirt).  Even my wife found it to be a bit small for her (women's medium).  We extended the strap as far as it would go.  It would be a great bag with another 2-4"" of strap.  Sadly, we had to return."
2.0,Big and cheap looking.
2.0,"PROS:<br />+easy to use<br /><br />CONS<br />-tiny<br />-easy to loose<br />-does not stay in place<br /><br />I ordered these nose rings, because I like just a little sparkle on the side of my nose.  When these arrived, I thought the zipper bag was empty and almost through it away.  Luckily I only set it aside.  Later, I looked again and felt with my fingers.  I found both nose rings hiding in the corner.  They were so small that even together I could barely find them.<br /><br />I put one in my nose.  The barrell was so thin I did not feel it go through.  Regardless, I liked the little sparkle.  Somehow, during the day, the nose ring  came out. I never felt it.<br /><br />I contacted the seller just to make them aware of my experience.  I made a suggestion that they put the nose rings on a card or something more substantial so they would be easier to find upon arrival.  I was not expecting or requesting a resolution.  I was surprised to find their response very dismissive, especially when they told me to contact Amazon with any issue.  It is my understanding that we are to contact the seller before leaving a less than positive review and make them aware of our experience.  So as far as customer service, improvement is needed, in my opinion.<br /><br />I received these nose rings at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review based on my personal experience."
2.0,"I own several of these dresses and love them. Unfortunately, this one came with a hole in the side. One that cannot be repaired so I reached out for a replacement but that didn’t happen:("
2.0,"Well, it’s an adult ladies large but fits a 10 year old."
2.0,"Was super adorable until the first wash. The hoodie shrunk in the arms horribly but still square shape with the rest of the fabric. I can't wear it anymore, it's sad cuz it's still really cute style."
2.0,Thing ring was beautiful but it was extremely heavy and my belly button hurt bad the day after like my skin didn't agree
2.0,Its ok. Nothing special. The material is hard and will take some time breaking into.
2.0,"I would not call this a button attacher. More like a tag attacher. This is not holding anything but a flimsy tag on fabric.  button was loose and floppy. One tug and it's coming off. Sadly, there does not seem to be anything on the market remotely capable of securing a button. Maybe I should design one and get rich. I would have paid 3xs as much for the real deal.Worst part is I suck at sewing so I still need a solution."
2.0,I ordered and rec’d this 10/2022<br />So in 5 months it has split - which is not what I expected
2.0,Didn't look as good when I got it as it does in the picture
2.0,"Too big, not pretty at all."
2.0,"This is an alright head band. I have never really found any that will stay on my head except for a few. This is one that will not stay on my head. I have to use bobby pins to keep it in place but its hard to because it is on the thicker side. Not one I will use on a daily basis. I like that it came in black, that its really stretchy. Just not one that fits my head like I want it too!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion"
2.0,Bought these for my son and daughter in law for their honeymoon. On their trip down my sons went missing and on the way home my daughter in laws fell off as well!
2.0,"I ordered 2XL, the arms fit super tight while the body was baggy and would in no way provide insulation in cold water. I returned it.  The price is right, just a matter of getting lucky on size and fit."
2.0,"Way way way too small, as if it's in Children's sizes (or doll sizes) even though it says Adult sizes."
2.0,Noisy
2.0,My daughter just wore this for the first time and it is coming apart. There is fish line in the skirt part to make it puffy and it is all coming out. Just becareful because small kids will put this in their mouth!!!! Very disappointed with how this dress is made.
2.0,I usually wear a 1x ordered a 2x cause I read it runs small - skin tight! Color is a little lighter than I expected.
2.0,these do run small. order 2 sizes up if you can. wish I could return.
2.0,"Very beautiful necklace, but it broke less than a week after I gave it to my girlfriend for Valentines Day :("
2.0,"I received this on Christmas eve.. The chain broke on the 26th. So even with taking it off every night to sleep... nope.<br />I mean I get that its Cheap, but isn't the point of a neckless that it be worn around ones neck?<br /><br />Guess I will have to buy a new chain for my gift."
2.0,"It's a pretty blouse and I like the lace at the top and the feel of the fabric.  The description said if you wear 2XL, order 5XL.  That's completely inaccurate.  The 5XL is close to between a Large and XL.  I was very disappointed as it's a beautiful blouse and the rosered color was the exact color I needed.  Definitely returning."
2.0,"I was so excited when I received this kimono. However, it did NOT live up to expectations. It was WAY too big for me (waist strap wise, I am a medium regularly) and cheaply made for almost thirty dollars. I could've dealt with this, but the one I ordered was the beautiful light blue one. I expected to get it as shown in the picture, but instead it was about 50% yellow and 50% blue. I looked back at the picture to make sure I wasn't wrong, but there is very little yellow. So I am returning for a refund. Be careful about buying this kimono, because you might not get what you think you are getting."
2.0,"Purchased a belt based on the reviews. Ordered a size 36 but when I compared it to other size 36 belts I had, it was about 2&#34; shorter (made in China). It's says real leather but feels like plastic. Color was a lot lighter than I thought. More camel colored. Putting in a return and going back to my old one."
2.0,The description said the sleeves had thumb holes... they do not. My daughter has been wearing this mostly back and forth to school and it already has a hole in the back. Not worth the money & false advertising!
2.0,"This is a great blouse for the price, but buyer beware! The sizing runs at least one full size small.. I am 5' 4"", 150lbs and have a 40D bust. I ordered size XL, which per the size guide said would fit 44""+. I cannot wear this top because the buttons gape open at the placket across my chest. Consider size carefully when ordering! The shirt fabric has NO stretch in it! If you have larger shoulders and or breasts, choosing correct sizing you must go up in sizes. I saw the fabrication was 65% polyester and 35% cotton so I was hoping it would not be too slinky/synthetic feeling despite the shirt description of ""silky."" Well, it is totally silky, which, I understand some women may like. Don't confuse silky with satiny. This top has a bit of texture like linen does, however it is quiet silky feeling AND it has a moderate amount of sheen. Because of the sheen, I would only wear this from November through perhaps February. Fabrics that have sheen seem very seasonal to me, especially since I live in the south. I don't particularly like clothing with sheen, so I was disappointed to see that this top was so shiny. This fabric has a very slight sandpaper feel to it-hence my earlier description that the fabric has texture, is shiny and silky, but not satiny feeling. This is not scratchy or uncomfortable, but I can feel the fibers drag on my finger tips. I would wear this top for seasonal events if it fit me, but I would not rebuy it. If the top were made out of cotton and rayon and ran true to the manufacturer's size guide I would consider it a winner-especially if it had no sheen! I got the rust color which is pretty, but that color is very deep and saturated. The color itself is also very seasonal to me even though I like earthy & natural colors. It is too bad about the poor sizing, because I really like the style of this top. I do wish it came in a different fabric."
2.0,"The buttons don't stay buttoned, slightly small running but not too bad. The buttons are teeny timy and don't seem like a match for the slots"
2.0,not bad but really cheap material.  Fit but looked like a sack on!  Absolutely would not wear.  Sent it back.
2.0,"I thought these were super cute when I saw them in Modcloth, so I was excited to see that they were cheaper here on Amazon. Sadly they didn't live up to the hype when I tried them on. Ordered half a size bigger (9 instead of 8.5) since this brand runs small. They were still uncomfortable. I'm not sure if it was because of the material on the upper, but it just didn't feel right when my toe hit. They seem kind of cheaply made, so I wasn't shocked to find that they didn't feel right walking from one side of my bedroom to the other. I had to return them 😕"
2.0,"It is way to small, the pic on line looks larger."
2.0,IS XL BUT IS TOO SMALL.I AM SO SAD BECAUSE IS BEAUTIFULL.I USE IT FOR A GIFT
2.0,"The print of this dress is cute, but the fabric and the sizing is not good. I have about a 36/38 C Chest and I can hardly get this XL around my chest and the sides are digging into my armpits and the neck hole is so small I could hardly get it on my head. It feels like a tablecloth and is really shiny and weird fabric. Probably would be really super cute if it was cotton and a little stretchy. This does not stretch whatsoever. I have it on right now and I think I might be stuck."
2.0,"I thought it was supposed to be fleece.....inside??  does keep ears warm,  would not re-order"
2.0,It arrived damaged. It actually looked used!<br /><br />I returned it.
2.0,Es mas chico que una talla M y ademas es corto.<br />No es comodo
2.0,The material resembled a pillow case. I was very disappointed. It was saggy in odd places and not complimentary at all.
2.0,Fragle and not made for big feet. They were cute though.
2.0,Cheaply made. Was falling apart at seams when I received it. Returned it.
2.0,lastimas la planta de tu pie
2.0,"Beware if you snap the snaps to secure this around your head, DO NOT UNDO THE SNAPS. They WILL BREAK. Just snap it and slide it on and off, don’t unsnap. Luckily I just needed this for my son for Halloween and not a long term thing."
2.0,So it looks really good but it’s very thing plastic and feels very cheap. Like once I put stuff in it it’s going to break. It looks good enough I’m not returning and giving to my 3 yr old who loves bags. I will be looking for a different tote bag.
2.0,"Very wide, hard to fit through loops."
2.0,Way too smll
2.0,"Very thin and cheaply made. I bought it thinking it would be good for the fall/winter, and it is not warm at all."
2.0,"I'm a skier and considering armada only makes skis I figured this bib pant would be geared toward a skier. They fit great. The large chest pocket is nice and there are plenty of other pockets if you need the storage. The fabric has a light stretch to it and moves as you move. The powder gator in the bottom cuff is snug and slip resistant to keep the snow out and keep you dry.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this pant is there is no protective fabric on the inside lower leg to prevent cuts from a stray ski that may kick up in moguls or a crash. I noticed a small cut after the first day of wear and after day two a large gash made it through the shell, liner and boot gator in one hard slice from a new ski.<br /><br />I contacted Armada just to express that they should have tough fabric for protection against ski cuts, but they only directed me to make a warranty claim. Their warranty expressly limits liability against such damage. With a turn around time of two weeks and no guarantee of replacement, I opted to repair and reinforce them myself.<br /><br />I ordered some 500 denier cordura, unstitched the bottom hem for access and sewed an appropriate sized piece over the shell fabric.<br /><br />They are holding up great now. The cordura is doing the job well. For the price of this pant and considering its intended use this feature - cut resistant boot cuffs - seems pretty basic. Even my son's $40 big box store pants have such a feature.<br /><br />In the picture you will see the cordura patch and the zigzag stitch repairing the nasty cut.<br /><br />It's too bad Armada didnt seem to care about the suggestion or moving it up the ladder. They just wanted to move me along to warranty claims.  Minimal effort."
2.0,"This was not what we wanted.  I purchased these for my husband who owned and really liked a pair of the blue blocker sunglasses back in the 80's I believe.  He has searched for a replacement for them for the last couple of years and has been unable to find anything similar to them.  I thought from the picture and description of them that these would be the same but once he got them and tried them on, he found they were not the same and not what he wanted."
2.0,"The V-neck isn’t even on both sides aka it is not centered. The sewing is poorly done. You get what you pay for. Great price, poor quality. Also it wrinkles easily"
2.0,"Lovely shoes. These are really quite cute. But, if you have wider feet, I'd maybe size up, these do tend to run pretty narrow. Maybe after consistent wearing, they'll be a bit more comfortable."
2.0,This dress was way to small for a large size.
2.0,I was excited to get this under wear but as soon as took the first pair out of package. I knew they would never fit.
2.0,I kind deslomes this charms cause they have a poor quality look.
2.0,this product didn't call out the fact that this is a &#34;tie it however you want&#34; top. It is not intuitive enough for me to figure out how to wrap it as shown in the product picture.<br />I'm debating on sending it back - I don't like clothing that requires this much brain power.
2.0,"Smaller than expected, had to give it to my 4 year old son"
2.0,The top overlay gets shorter and shorter with each washing.
2.0,"la verdad es que pense que seria mas comoda la cartea, pero no es asi. Es muy alta y tiende a salirse del bolsillo del pantalon, tuve que cortar el pedazo de mas, si no se saldria y perderia mis documentos y dinero. NO LA RECOMIENDO PARA NADA!!"
2.0,It looks more like a kid's dress up toy than something an adult would wear in a wedding.
2.0,The case does not stay shut. I pull the drawstring closed and later in my purse my glasses are half out of the case with it completely back open.
2.0,Nice shoe but … absolutely terrible in snow and ice or even damp surfaces due to moisture.<br /><br />Zero grip<br /><br />Just had total hip replacement surgery and was scared to death 💀 walking into store.<br /><br />It had just snowed and I felt totally unsafe.<br /><br />Zero grip for a brand new shoe.
2.0,"I bought 3 of these at the same time, so I could always have an umbrella in my car, at work, and at home. The first one broke after 5 or 6 uses. The second wouldn't even stay open from the very first try. I'm left with one functional one, which, by past experience, I can't trust. For $30 I could have had one decent umbrella.<br /><br />Update from 2017-04-17: the last one, which survived nearly a year, broke, in a torrential storm. I managed to make it to my car only getting mildly soaked."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:256b1802e81950865b576af4ba374cca]] The necklaces are fine.  The earrings are not even close to what is pictured.  They’re three times as big as the sunflowers on the necklaces and they’re ugly.
2.0,eye glass frame is very uncomfortable.
2.0,"I am a little iffy about this product it has potential but it’s not there yet.<br /><br />First the trainer is all separate  pieces, none of them are actually connected. So do not let the picture fool you.<br /><br />The little piece you see that looks like it connects the top to the bottom is actually fake and actually does nothing it’s decoration (like fake pockets).<br /><br />The shaper does nothing for my figure I have a natural hour glass figure and it did nothing for me. I thought it would enhance my figure but no.<br /><br />My waist is high so that is also a problem with this, it does not support that because when I place the trainer it ends up giving me a lower belly muffin top because it can’t reach my problem area which is my lower stomach (fumpa). Which basically means it doesn’t go over my problem area because of were my waist naturally sits.<br /><br />Velcro is used to keep it together.<br /><br />The only good I got from this is that it will actually make the area you have it on sweat."
2.0,"These shoes were really cute, but the shoe size ran smaller then expected. A size 8 on my daughter is a little big, but I ordered a size 8 of these shoes and she couldn't get her foot in them. I had to return them."
2.0,"I received this shirt at a discount in an exchange for my honest review. You can definately tell this came from China. The material is rather cheap but that's not the biggest issue. It is way too short. Maybe if you are five feet tall it would work, but I am 5'8 and it's not nearly as long as in the picture. I will never be able to wear it so I will probably just give it to my ten year old daughter."
2.0,"I am never at a loss for words, but after trying on the Actloe Women V Neck Floral Printed Multicolor Top, I was speechless. I am 5'3"", 117 lbs with a 36DD chest and I received a size large which fit loose, as it should since I am usually a size small in vanity sized apparel. I can gauge what a top should look like when sewn correctly, but both sleeves were uneven with an entire inch more armhole and sleeve on one side versus the other. The combination of a boxy style and puffed sleeves would be unflattering on my body type no matter what size it was. I cannot recommend this style to anyone who is top heavy or has broad shoulders. It could work on gals with a narrow frame and a smaller bust, as the model. The low rating is for the lack of quality. I can forgive a style that isn't the best cut for my shape when it is well made."
2.0,Way too small. Had to return it.
2.0,"Had to give it away because it is much too small. My friend who has a cat just like this fit into it perfectly and it is great quality, though!"
2.0,This ones don't tuck your belly in at all. You might as well wear nothing
2.0,"Color was expected, but definitely disappointed in the material. Not sweatshirt material at all. It’s like silky/shiny, very cheap"
2.0,They are cute but I was disappointed with the arch support. I actually bought arch support inserts and put in them. Now they are a little snug so I only wear thin socks. I wished I’d ordered a half size larger.
2.0,Bracelet broke after wearing once<br />The clamps are super cheap and snapped completely apart<br />:(
2.0,"Overall this product is ok, but once you sweat and the fabric gets wet it becomes very hard to breath thru. Also after one use I washed it in the sink and a lot of black paint came out... so I would say it’s not that great of a product."
2.0,"Well, I'm 5'1 120 lbs ordered a small. Sadly it's way to big and looks like I'm wearing a potato sack almost down to my ankles.😣"
2.0,"La idea es buena, muy bonito diseño, pero no es de muy buena calidad, está muy delgado....puede mejorar"
2.0,"I received this shirt as a gift from my sister after it sat on my Wishlist for-like-ever. I think the size fits as expected, however, the fit is a little strange. I felt the sleeves were too short, and that could be because I have broad shoulders. The shoulder seams were too narrow for me. Because of the way this shirt is designed (the back slit, particularly), the front of the shirt gaped and made me look pregnant. I am not pregnant and I do not have a large stomach! The camo lining fit really well. I think this shirt might be cute on another body type, but it wasn't cute on me at all. It MAY have been better if the shirt was a little longer or the backside came together at the bottom of the shirt (with just a slit/open piece revealing the camo under). I did have to return this shirt, unfortunately. Thank you, Amazon, for free returns!"
2.0,Didn't even try the dress on since the material felt more like an outdoor tablecloth than a gown. Very strange material choice.
2.0,"These layering fake tops would be super cute for the following people: 1) Five-year-olds, 2) Women who normally wear American size extra small. For everyone else, not so much. WAY TOO SMALL for 95% of women on the planet."
2.0,"It fits big! I am 5’3” & about 120lbs, it was too big but great material & stretch! Great quality, just runs big!"
2.0,These are the right size 20-30- but a little big they don't hold very good compression for my legs
2.0,"I based on the listing photos, I was hoping to receive a light brown leather strap with red felt backing. I neglected to read the detail, which says “the color of shoulder mat back maybe in red or black, it will send randomly.” As it turns out, I received a red strap with a light brown shoulder mat with black felt. Appears all items are randomly sent. Nobody wants a $67 mismatched strap for their $1,500+ vintage Hassalblad camera. See the photos of the strap I received, which is well made, but looks awful. Don’t buy!"
2.0,The packing wasn’t great the glasses came in scratched and bent. They are easily bent back but that’s bad too because when you fold the sides in it bends the frame each time. I’m assuming this has to do with the resistance that is at the joint of the glasses. I’m only giving two stars because they really are super cute and fit well when they aren’t bent.
2.0,"Disappointed in this purchase. I bought these for my daughter to wear around the house because they would be easy for her to put on herself (she’s 1 1/2) We got them and they have a sling back on them and my daughter hates them because she can’t put them on herself. I don’t know if it’s cause we ordered a toddler size that they come with the sling back, but then that needs to be advertised. We will be returning these."
2.0,Frames are small...not flattering on my face shape.
2.0,WAY TOO SMALL FOR ANY ADULT<br />Too small for a 12 yr. old as well.
2.0,Band was too tight. Returned the dress.
2.0,Boobs will fly out if you rise arms or I want to say with basic movement you would still have to keep pulling top down.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these boots, they look great in the photos!  However, they are way too long, like clown show long.  I'm usually an 7.5-8 in shoes so I ordered an 8 thinking better to have room for socks, but it was huge.  I tried a 7.5, still looked like I was wearing skis.  (See photos comparing these boots to other size 7.5 shoes I have).  I even went down to a 7, which was only about an inch too long in the toe, but the fit was so off on my arch that they weren't comfortable at all."
2.0,"Enjoy the compression of the underwear, I just wish that they were higher. I was hoping it would control my stomach as I am postpartum but it just creates a higher roll. Would not recommend these to someone postpartum."
2.0,Super thick material that's hard to breath out of.
2.0,"First off, it's nit sterling silver like it advertises. It's nit stamped anywhere on the ring with 925 and I did an acid test. It runs about a half size smaller. That being said, for costume jewelry, it is pretty."
2.0,I bought 2 sets one for the bf & I and one for the bff & I. Well I was super excited to get them and as I have worn my sets I have learned that my bracelets are rubbing off onto my skin and are not true Stone material as I believed they were. I'm so disappointed.
2.0,Got a run in the right thigh the second time I worm them straight across my lower thigh.
2.0,"It took almost month to get here and when I finally got it, it was too small. If your oder, I would go up a size. It will just sit in my closet. It is cute and the shirt is soft but sadly it is to small."
2.0,Super tight and small.  Wore other brands and assumed would be sized the same.
2.0,"Too small, guys. Move along."
2.0,"These fit well and have awesome pockets, BUT they were completely see-through. Only buy these if you’re okay with everything (and I do mean EVERYTHING) being visible when you wear them."
2.0,The holes are way to big they show her whole leg not satisfied
2.0,Too big and heavy on the neck.
2.0,"My son was so excited to get these, however the 1st time he wore them they tore a hold in the knee. Very thin material."
2.0,The mane fur was short and sparse. The ears look more like monkey's then lion's. All in all not impressed.
2.0,Definitely cheaper looking in person low key disappointed . The stone in the middle llooks bright red and cheap and tacky
2.0,To have no snaps on bag
2.0,"I ordered a 1x . It was a xl. The pkg. it came in said 1x but on the blouse tag it said Xl. Arm holes, neck and length was totally off.<br />I am returning it."
2.0,I didn't like the quality of the fabric at all. Very itchy and unnatural feeling. I returned them as soon as I got them.
2.0,"Propeller second hand will not reset to zero.  Chronograph hands impossible to distinguish against black background, except in the brightest light.  World time 1:00, 2:00, 13:00, etc. notations on outer dial impossible to read except in brightest light.  Loses time over the period of a week.  Poorly written instructions."
2.0,The first time that my daughter wore these the toe seem came apart.  So i just sewed it up and am hoping for the best.  But I would not purchases these again.
2.0,"I have to wear a shirt underneath bc the fabric is very thin. I am 5'9&#34; and 110 lbs, I usually order a small, but thought I would go up a size due to issues in past online ordering. Med fit perfectly, a little worried if it will shrink when I wash it."
2.0,"My son was really excited about this sweatshirt based on the picture. However, when it arrived we were disappointed. It runs very small and is cotton (so will shrink even more), and the image on the sweatshirt is not as vivid in color (it's more like a pastel  pink and red color), is half the size and is not as clear as pictured. It is very pixelated. It arrived before the expected shipping date."
2.0,I always order a size larger from Amazon but this time the size ran so much smaller than the size shown I had to return it.  The fabric was so thin you wouldn't even be able to wash it on a gentle cycle.
2.0,The dress was made horrible. The collar lays right on one side but the other side sits behind your neck which makes one side of the dress higher than the other. I’m glad I don’t purchase 2 of them. Please don’t buy this.
2.0,Didnt look good on me.
2.0,"The clicker part of it isn't stiff, making it hard to put in your nose. The actual ring of it I found too small for my nose as well. Was 3 weeks late for my shipping. It's cute though."
2.0,The original HD Vision Aviators came in an amber lens color. These appear to look like an amber color in the picture of them.  They do not come that way. To dark for me
2.0,Top crossed to high and second didn’t come close to covering 38ddd breast
2.0,Had to return. Didn't fit right around my ankles and the heels seemed very flimsy like that would break. Didn't feel like sturdy shoe at all.
2.0,"Pattern/cut of jumper is good, but that’s where it ends. The fabric is terrible and has that “flammable” look. I just couldn’t wear it."
2.0,Material seems cheap
2.0,I loved the earrings.  I wore them about 6 times when the pearl fell off of one.  I now need to take it to a shop to get a repair done.  I did not lose the pearl.  It was a disappointment to have it fall apart.
2.0,"The description for this item was Praanjal's elephant earrings and I thought they were so neat so I ordered them. Instead, I received a ring with an elephant on it.<br /><br />The band of the ring is slightly bent.  I'm not sure how well the band is attached to the elephant /stone portion of the ring. It looks like it could easily break off at any moment. (see photo) The ring size is too large for me and the elephant/stone part of the ring is much bigger than i normally wear.  I do think the elephant on the ring is awesome.  I also like the color of the stone as well .<br /><br />This isn't a ring that I will wear.  My SIL, however, happens to be a fan of elephants and giraffes so I plan on giving this to her if she wants it."
2.0,These shorts are extremely THIN. You can see through the gray shorts.
2.0,Not as nice as it looks in the picture.
2.0,These are pretty bad. I know it's acheap price but I was not expecting the quality to be like this. They look like a toy for little girls dress up. They don't look like the product photo.
2.0,I love the backpack and the versatility but I want the backpack to be resting in my mid back to upper back and it cannot do that. The straps are as tight as possible and will not go any higher. I am 6 feet and 2 inches tall and I just want my backpack to fit a correct way. I might have to go to a leather shop to see what I can do. I wish the seller could reach out to me to offer suggestions of where I can adjust the straps.
2.0,Not impressed as it is not what I wanted a waste of time and money did not even fit
2.0,Didn't fit me well and the inner lining was very short and more of an off white color.
2.0,I really love the product but there is a bright pink stain on the back of one of the legs!!  UGH!!!
2.0,Cute but tiny. Small is like a child’s medium
2.0,"They were nice, but wish they were shorter. One of the opals was facing the wrong direction where the back was being shown on wear."
2.0,The bezel set crystal popped out on the first night. Oh well.
2.0,"okay. they rust really easy after washing your hands like 3 times, however, they are cheap, what else did i expect?"
2.0,"Great idea. But the belt buckle, not even the ratcheting piece, sheared off at the pins within a month or so. Totally unusable now."
2.0,"I only wore this one time, it was too small so, I went back to a regular mask."
2.0,Not a good quality. Didn't even match the design on the site.
2.0,They are really cute looking but the problem is I can't even get them on. One of the pairs looks broken and the other one will not fit through my ear lobe as it is not wide enough. If I were able to get them on it looks like they would be hard to take off. The earrings are so small and my fingers are bigger.
2.0,I ordered Gold received SILVER!
2.0,does not fit well and is not what I expectede
2.0,"These didn’t hold my boobs at all. I don’t have very big boobs, a C for reference. Also the sticky part was annoying as I can’t travel with a giant sticker. It stuck to everything, and only got 1 or 2 uses. It’s not for long term use. I would buy a strapless bra next time. Not worth it at all."
2.0,"If your arms are kind of thicker than average person, don't buy this. It'll choke your blood veins tightly."
2.0,Did not fit true to size. Material is cheap.
2.0,Hooks are sturdy however they don't stay clamped. Comes easily unhooked.
2.0,Smelly and too awkward/large to fit well.
2.0,They are too hard to zip around the corners
2.0,I did not care for this purse.  The material seemed flimsy and you had to &#34;assemble&#34; the handle which was very thin.  It wasn't for me so I returned it.
2.0,"The sleeves have holes (openings) in several parts , it doesn’t show on the picture, also fabric feels cheap"
2.0,"I really wanted to love this, but there’s a bit of a delay when speaking and the programmed images would randomly come on."
2.0,"Bought this for my dad for Halloween. He said the suit fit snug, I bought him a 2XL and the material is cheap. He wore it one night and the material color was rubbing off where the holsters were situated on his legs and created fuzzball‘s by the end of the night. The belt was extremely tight and the holsters were so cheap they started ripping before my dad even put them on. He even tried to staple them together as you can see in the photos. Like I said looks cute on, but very cheap and definitely not worth $125. My dad is 5’11 and 200lbs for reference"
2.0,We should be able to order the top size different from the bottom. Also the straps on the top look thicker in the picture than they actually are in real life. But still cute! But i ordered a medium but I should be a small top and large or even extra large in bottoms. Bottoms definitely run extra small
2.0,came is much thinner than expected
2.0,"Nice dress,  but is much shorter than the reviews I read. Will probably return."
2.0,"I ordered this suit after reading positive reviews from customers similar to my size 5’5 165lbs and 36D cup size. I ordered the large and the top was way too small...like probably a full A cup. If you don’t have much on top, this suit is really cute and seems durable."
2.0,"The white ones are this company's tunnels and the red ones are a different company's tunnels for comparison. Size 3/4. They're almost half the size in thickness as most tunnels and about 1 mm bigger so I feel like I'm slightly stretching. Also they feel more like hard plastic and less like silicone. They continue to pop up in my ear, as shown in the third pic, and I dont think I I'll be keeping them. I wear silicone when I wanna give my ears a break from weight so I'm not sure if this is gonna give them the break I was hoping for."
2.0,Chap material. Frays easily.
2.0,"The reason I am giving this 2 stars is because I am beyond annoyed by people design dresses for women, yet somehow forget to account for the fact that we have boobs. This dress has potential to be classy with sleeves and the modest length, but then there is absolutely zero coverage up top. I ordered a small if that helps anyone figure out the sizing. It's not see-through and minus the static you can see it fits nicely everywhere else (I'm 5'5 125). Perhaps if you're crafty with a sewing machine you could make this work."
2.0,"These pants are very thin. I could tell the color of my son's underwear. I can not imagine they will hold up to sliding into bases, ie. normal kid wear and tear. Returning them."
2.0,A little tight amd also don’t have drawstrings to secure in correct place
2.0,"Husband can't wear a watch on his wrist, so has been wearing a clip on for years.  His broke ( the hooking mechanism) so I was looking for a new one.  He received it 2 weeks ago and today he noticed the crystal on the front had fallen off the face of the watch.  No idea of how or when!! This does not make for a good review for this watch."
2.0,He tenido dificultad en conseguir el tamaño adecuado para mí.
2.0,"I loved It, but I just got one instead of two as mentioned it on my order. If feels very comfortable abd total control of my belly, and I'm giving only 2 stars just because I got one instead of two. I hope I can still get the other one."
2.0,"If you have any curves at all, its not flattering. I ordered an XL and it was tight when I can normally fit into a large. Color way darker than shown."
2.0,Not night glasses
2.0,"Looked like a paper bag on me. Not fitted AT ALL (see pic). Material was a bit thin and papery feeling. Also, the pattern looks in the picture like it is a border around the bottom of the dress, but it isn't. It is cut off more on the sides and I didn't like how that looked. I returned it.<br /><br />I bought another summer dress at the same time and it look and felt like an incredible fit and I kept it and have since bought 2 more. Here's the one I liked better: [[ASIN:B0749RPHTM ACEVOG Womens Casual Fit and Flare Floral Sleeveless Dress Pattern 1 L]]<br /><br />Hope this helps! Since reviews take time and thought to write in a meaningful way and to photograph the product's usage, please click &#34;yes&#34; below if this review helped you! Thank you so much!!!"
2.0,Not a very good product and connecting pins were missing.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this best, and from a craftsman standpoint, it's great. The problem? The head of the belt doesn't fit many of my pant loops!"
2.0,"Well the bee is cute, but the 'gem' has a more &#34;cheap costume jewelry for children&#34;. The charm isn't very dense, so it won't quite hang right without enough pull at the bottom. You can try getting crafty with it though, and hang in on a necklace with some complimentary pendants that have more weight to them. Again though, it will look a a bit cheap, and it doesn't have a smooth 'glassy' feel to the gem surface. If you are okay with the feel of cheap, mass produced, costume shame on you skin, you can keep the jewel part, but I'll definitelly be working just the bee into other necklaces."
2.0,Typically I wear a large. I ordered a medium and it was very big.  The weirdest part is the armpits on the sweater actually hang almost to my elbow.  Have not decided if I want to return it or not.
2.0,Super super tiny...not a pendant but a charm. Chain very short as well...Cute otherwise but it will definitely look like a choker on me...
2.0,Arrived with a huge tear along the seam on one of the pants.
2.0,Way too small.  Cute though.  I'm a 16 and the XXL was very much too small.
2.0,Only received half of the band. What I did receive was perfect. Seller refuses to answer e-mail. Buy elsewhere.
2.0,"The denim was to thick but when I went to return it, the return fee was as much as the aprons...."
2.0,My band broke in 2 months! Also not very feminine. Definitely for men. The pins arent straight... And a few also bent while in the band. Kinda disappointed.
2.0,Too short. Wish the length was a bit longer. And somewhat thin material is not as good as I expected. Can't wear it in winter.
2.0,"I really loved the look of this thing, and then I washed it once.  It pilled up immediately and now looks grubby and cheap."
2.0,"Looks nice, but the sleeves stretch right away and do not wear anything black underneath or black pants as you will get stuck with lint all over your clothes."
2.0,big bulky not what I expected
2.0,"Listing says 6 pieces, but only 4 masks in the package"
2.0,I order 3 of these and returning back all 3 of them. I went up a size and they are all too small.
2.0,Runs smaller than other leggings in the same size.
2.0,Love the comfort of this sweater just makes me angry that the sleeve are super short!? Like above my wrists and it's so annoying. Other than that this sweater is great for work
2.0,Watch is as described but I threw it out ...the watch face is super tiny ... it’s like a child’s watch face
2.0,This is not a thin dress. It has super thick lining and is heavy to wear.
2.0,Got a small and it looks like a garbage bag on me. The model is smaller than me so I’m not sure how it looks so fitted on her.
2.0,"The seller delivered the mask in a timely manner.  The mask, however, is quite small.  It leaves a portion of your face uncovered so it will be necessary to purchase a face mask to cover up the lower portion of your jaw.  It would be a very good mask if it were larger."
2.0,"Color of the band is beautiful but that’s really the only positive I can say, and that my be somewhat generous. The band actually came dirty, and appeared to have been used already. The watch buckle is extremely cheap feeling and isn’t removable. I really really wanted to like it but the flaws outweighed the beautiful color."
2.0,BUCKLE NOT WORKING. STOPS LOCKING WHEN I TRY TO GO FURTHER.
2.0,Didn't last long easy to tear.
2.0,Smaller than needed even for a size 3.
2.0,Great material<br />But the cut was not good at all<br />Very boxy and frumpy
2.0,Short shrink a lot after washing... almost fit like underwear.  Uncomfortable
2.0,Fabric is too thin and the fit is too snug.
2.0,The snaps comes off easily. Not a good quality especially if you are in a hurry changing diaper bec the snaps will come off
2.0,One side good  other  not so good🤔
2.0,"While the &#34;malachite&#34; wrap bracelet is nice looking unfortunately what I received was not real malachite gemstone beads. A few beads had dents/cracks that when viewed with a jeweler's loop showed white resin interior and the surface was a painted epoxy made to look like malachite. Checked rest of the beads and noticed their surface, some with scratches showing white underneath.  Again, it's nice looking but not real malachite. Title should include 'simulated' so not to be misleading."
2.0,small and easy to break. fit well on my wrist but I have very small wrists. I bought this as a gift for a friend but it was comically small on her so I kept it for myself. A few chains broke on the first wear. I loved it though so I turned it into a brooch.
2.0,Product arrived on schedule. Quality of the material holding the bracelet together was cheap. Within a week It was broken and there were beads all over my bathroom floor.
2.0,Really small bag. You can tell it is a cheap bag.
2.0,Very cheap. Arm was broken before arrival on the first pair. Reordered and we will see about next pair.
2.0,"Super cute, comfortable shorts. But they don’t last long. After a few wears they got holes so I requested a replacement..which also got holes after a few wears."
2.0,"It would be awesome if all the pumpkins were not upside down :( I'm sure by the time I get it exchanged, October will pretty much be over. Disappointed."
2.0,The pink undies had a hole in the seams.
2.0,Quality not well made.
2.0,Do not buy the white. 100% see through!
2.0,Youth size. Delivered fast. I'll use them for something else.
2.0,"Size was good, color was fine, but it was impossible to get the wrinkles & creases out of this top. I washed in cold water, warm water, dried on regular heat, low heat, no heat & hang to dry. I do not iron but despite this fact my mother gave me one a couple of years ago so I broke down & tried pressing it on various heat settings, with & without steam. If I didn't know better I'd think it was made from recycled plastic bottles. Too bad because other than the wrinkles it was exactly what I wanted."
2.0,Once again way to big but instead of returning decided to give away
2.0,"This is a beautiful product.  However, I ordered the one in the top photo and got the one in the bottom photo - twice.<br /><br />In addition, the lining on both products is shown as black.  The lining on the two hoodies I received was white both times.<br /><br />Not sure how to rate the fit.  The description says they run a size small, so I ordered an XL that turned out to be immense.  When I ordered the second time, I ordered a Large (my usual size) and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />There are no washing or care instructions, which is unusual, and make sizing a little more difficult (since I don't know if it would shrink if put in the clothes dryer).<br /><br />I'm only giving the product a '2' since I didn't get the style I wanted (both times), but if you're ordering the style in the bottom photo (on the website), it's a '5'"
2.0,"This has potential, but the zipper is so cheaply made that I doubt I'll be able to wear it more than three times before it goes into the garbage."
2.0,"I only had it for a week ... Somehow it fell off so I had to order another. Surprising because the magnet seemed strong. I liked the look. Seemed durable .... Fit good ... Idk what else is it supposed to do?<br /><br />removing starts. it says black and silver, it shows blue and silver ... i ordered two and got something different each time"
2.0,I bought the glasses because I really liked the style and metal frame. I have had them a couple of months and the uv film on the lenses is peeling off around the outside of the lenses.
2.0,great design but the bag came misshaped and didn't look as elegant in person
2.0,I am 5’0 115 pounds and I got a small and it was huge!! If you are taller it would fit better but still might be a little big. It did have pretty good fabric though.
2.0,Scarf looks more green than dark grey....disappointed but will keep
2.0,Liked the quality and liked the lining of this coat but even with ordering a larger size it was to tight in the shoulders.. I have found that most clothes sold that have been made in China are to small.  Be careful when ordering sizes are not to US sizes.
2.0,Design is accurate to pic. Sizing is small and material is more pajama than pant. You are getting what you pay for.
2.0,Needs a longer belt
2.0,"Nothing wrong with these earrings, really, but for my taste, they are too shiny and cheap looking.  I returned them and will search for similar ones that are real silver"
2.0,Lenses are cheap plastic. They’re blurry and don’t seem to do much when using for computer glare glasses
2.0,Hat does not sit properly on head.
2.0,"It's okay.  Smaller than what they specify on the size charts, but I am still deciding if I want to hang on to it for alterations.  Very, very, very sheer.  CANNOT be worn without a slip, and they did a very poor job of commmunicating that in the listing."
2.0,"i liked the boot although when i received them i was very disappointed,  they looked as though they were worn already. they had white marks all over them as if they had salt spots."
2.0,The picture makes it look like there are sequin sparkles but it is not sparkly at all
2.0,It does not take long to turn your toes green. Out of the whole pack there were only 3 or 4 that didn't pinch my toe that I could wear.
2.0,Didn't fit run very small
2.0,"The glasses look beautiful, BUT the connection between the each prong that hooks over your ears and the sunglasses themselves is only an unprotected very tiny screw that easily loosens just through wear.  In the last two weeks i've caught the screw over halfway unscrewed three times.  The screw will also come out on its own causing the prong and the sunglasses to disconnect, the screw is very hard to screw back in because no normal screwdriver isn't thin enough, and it's even harder to find the screw if it comes out.  The screw has come out of my glasses twice now, and i have lost the screw so theses glasses are unwearable for me now.  Spending your money more wisely by investing in a better pair of sunglasses, these ones will come apart."
2.0,These are beautiful but too heavy for my thin earlobes.  I will not wear them but I will find a friend who has thicker lobes.  They will make a lovely gift for the appropriate friend!
2.0,I got the skeleton and the bones on one side are higher up than the other. Other than that it's super comfy.
2.0,"I got a size too big,’hoping it would fit . It did not. Will be returning.  Still too small. Returning both dresses."
2.0,"i was so excited when i purchased this but when it arrived my gosh i look like a clown... i likd the fur because its so soft,  but i dont like the fur comes in different way it fits well and i have a small face, and i cant wear it, i wish i can send it back..."
2.0,"I don't have a very big head, but these are too small. My 12 year old likes them, but they didn't work so well on me."
2.0,Thinnn. They are definitely see through even when I went up a size. I’m normally a small I went to a medium.
2.0,It’s okay. The metal feels cheap and is probably fake. It will likely tarnish after a few wears
2.0,Just too floppy and out of shape after being folded into thirds for shipping. I had to return it
2.0,"Photos suggest this flower crown circles an adult head. It would barely circle a newborn noggin. Good looking, especially for the price, but, not nearly large enough to go halfway around my head. The large, stiff wires that hold it together are clearly visible and would likely make it too uncomfortable for a child.<br /><br />It would work for an adult photo prop, as long as all the pics were straight-on face front shots."
2.0,They are very silky feeling.<br />They are easy to snag.<br />I'm on the chubby side and they bunch up uncomfortably around my ankles.
2.0,too tights....creates bulges around elastic at top and bottom.
2.0,"Very narrow, you have to have really small narrow feet for these to work."
2.0,"I ordered this to leave at work for when I get cold.. it was cheap and when it arrived, I feel the fabric is a bit cheap, with an odd feel to it.."
2.0,The color is good and the fit is accurate but the fabric is a little thin.  Might only wash a few times before it wears out.
2.0,Wont stay on...not even 2 min..
2.0,the tabs and trim are a little too shiny for my personal taste.  The rest is great.  Returning.
2.0,Alot if my pieces was defected
2.0,"Very Beautiful ring, delivered quickly, However the second time my wife wore ring the cross broke off without even hitting it on anything. The time limit for the return was already up by time this happened."
2.0,Very poorly printed! Very grainy and pieces missing can barely see details in the suit archer is wearing just looks like a black blob
2.0,Fit as expected but far from flattering. I gave it away.
2.0,"Love me a good chiffon Kimono but the colors on This were so off. Very orange. Almost like a burnt orange. I’m sure I Could Rock it and make it work, just wasn’t what I expected."
2.0,Broke easily after only a couple of weeks without any drops
2.0,Kind of cute. Broke immediately though.
2.0,Beautiful top and ordered  my normal size &#34; it was too snug on me and it showed every bkiump.
2.0,The picture of this ring is very deceptive because it looks solid and expensive with the engraving inside of the in the advertising but when I received it is very light in weight and looks very cheap! I didn't send back didn't feel it was worth the trouble
2.0,Def smaller in size
2.0,Nice bad but definitely not for the Oris Aquis.
2.0,Would have loved them if they fit.
2.0,"I gave these to my 8-year-old for Easter.  She likes them but says they are a little heavy. However, after only 2 days of wear the back lights on one of shoes stopped working. I tried today April 24th to get a replacement through Amazon and since they were ordered March 24th (30days) it says I can't. VERY disappointed."
2.0,Does not fit regular ear pieces.
2.0,I liked the watch and the style is great but the pin used to strap the watch down broke after 3 months and the black around the watch scraped away quickly so one side didn't even look black (30 days after purchase). It was also a hassle losing pins to the watch which would constantly slide out and be lost.
2.0,Package got lost in the mail but arrived a week later. They're cute looking but the noises are LOUD and hard on the ears. NOT A GOOD CHOICE FOR THOSE WITH SENSORY ISSUES! Not really worth it in my opinion.
2.0,They are cute but I have lost about 5 of these so far because the diamond keeps falling out no matter how tight I screw it in.
2.0,I guess I should have taken a closer look at the photos..  These are SO SHORT I would be too embarrassed to wear them in public.  And material is mediocre.
2.0,"I was disappointed in these. I was hoping for cute dainty cuffs and these are the opposite. They’re heavy and cumbersome. They are not dainty like I was envisioned. They are worth the money as you get several colors for the price, but they’re not at all what I imagined."
2.0,They worked well for a couple days but now the lights don't work properly they come on and off when they want to.
2.0,Hat too floppy! Drooped down & wouldn't stay up.
2.0,Kind of a greenish yellow and sheds a lot of little bits.
2.0,Short was made for someone very petite. Daughter wears a med and the button came off bc it's tight
2.0,"This necklace is beautiful, however I cannot get the lobster clasp to open at all.  Not sure if it's just stuck or defective or what.  Will not ever be able to wear it, unfortunately!!"
2.0,"Despite ordering my regular size, there was no way this was going to fit. I would have had to go up two sizes at least for it to work."
2.0,The bottoms looked great on me but the top not so much ! It left a weird tan line and just didn’t flatter me. I wasnt exuding the confidence that I figured I would but hey at least a good bottom out of it
2.0,The color of sweatee is not as seen in photos. It's red vs burgundy color.
2.0,"Consistency of sand paper and smaller than expected.  Returned right away.  Even at the lightning deal price they werent worth wearing,  maybe just not my style"
2.0,"The description said 3-layers, but it felt like only, if that.  Material was rather rough too.  Plus it was very tight even for a petit person as me.  I sent it back."
2.0,Cute but cheep. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"El cuerpo no se puede adjustable bien, cuando caminas se sube todo. La peluca se le caen mucho los Pelosi, los demas accesorios excellente."
2.0,Definitely size up at least one size if not 2. Everyone of my scrub tops are medium. These don't come close to fitting. Should have tried on before removing the tags and washing.
2.0,"they are way to smaller my needs, they are cute, not alluring."
2.0,"I'm always the same size in grace Karin dresses but this one was so large in my midsection and back area. Which was odd because the chesy fit. Also, I didnt care for the red color. It didnt seem as pictured. Returned. Fyi, I'm 132 lbs, 5'4 and order ordered a medium"
2.0,"This material is NOT 100% cotton. I am not sure if it contains any cotton, as the description says, but it is very light, stretchy and synthetic material (like nylon). It is also cheap-looking and every band comes with loose stitches that you have to cut off. I expected much better quality for this price point. Unhappy with this purchase, especially because it says it's cotton and it's clearly not."
2.0,"Although these  glasses look like the same glasses I ordered they are larger.  I order the 55 mil because I know what fits and I purchased another pair out of different wood and they are the correct size from looking at these they are more than likely 63 I have not measured because my husband is going to take them.  (He wears glasses so getting no prescription sunglasses for him is kind of a waste of money, but at least I don't have to deal with sending them back)  This is the only reason for the lower rating and it is more a packaging issue than a product issue."
2.0,Kind of cheap..get what you paid for
2.0,Shoes are not comfortable and they were a little narrow but stretched fast
2.0,This dress was too large in the chest and arms. The color was not as bright of a green as the picture suggested either.
2.0,"I don't want o say they're cheap, but...they're cheap, didn't fit. I ordered a different pair as well, I contacted support, they said it would cost too much to send it back to China. Rrfunded me 40%. I hmgave them both to my sister in law. I think she likes hmthem. They are super soft and super cute. Will not hold up for long."
2.0,"If this looks appealing to you, I need to make you aware of two things:<br />First: if you do not have a lube station or something solid you can fit this switch opener into, it's going to be a lot less effective.<br />Second: I bought this because I needed to open a bunch of Outemu Reds, which are Kailh style switches. This Kailh side of this opener failed to open any of the twelve switches I tried before I gave up and bought a different opener. When you try to open a Kailh style switch with this, one side will always slip past the opener wedge no matter how careful you are. The material just wasn't strong enough.<br /><br />I also feel I need to mention that it's very expensive for what it is, not to mention the malfunction on Kailh style switches."
2.0,Doesn’t fit or look like the picture
2.0,This shirt has a giant size collar.
2.0,"If you go by manufacturer's measurements get two sizes bigger. I got the size based on the measurements and measured myself  a few times, this item arrived and I cant get it past my thighs.<br /><br /> It feel and looks high quality but I can't use it to find out how it wears. I should have listened to the reviews and got larger size!!"
2.0,"These come down to the ankles, more like Capri pants than shorts"
2.0,Awful nylon fabric. Like wearing think tights.
2.0,"Cheap material, definitely NOT leather"
2.0,"I was not expecting something this big and heavy.  I love the design, but I am just not big enough to wear big pot metal things.  It's hanging on the wall.  I hope one of these days design folks can make much smaller things."
2.0,"I like how big the bag is & all the pockets, but within a few days I noticed 2 of pockets were busted. I'm not sure if they came that way or not. I had not over stuffed or over weighted either of them. Only put a few ounces of weight in each. 1 had 4 credit cards in a very light holder the other had about 15 business cards. Metal buckets make it a little heavy and when you don't have it adjusted to be a backpack straps are awkward."
2.0,"These are cute in theory but not great for working out. You need to close the back with a knot and ouch, it's more painful than the post workout soreness. It's now collecting dust in my draw."
2.0,"Packaging was awesome ...I barely tried them on... Put them back exactly as they were shipped to me .... I guess if you buy cheap boots you should expect cheap boots lol ...These were too big too tall ...I'm only 5'2""...Size 6 1/2,  7 ... They charged me to send them back... Classless act if you ask me..."
2.0,Extremely large earrings.  I returned.
2.0,It is smaller than I thought. Not loose and flowy.
2.0,"Disappointed, I've always worn man's size 2X or 3X. When I read it was unisex I was skeptical. I was correct this is not a man's 3X.<br />Will be returning, really wanted it to work because of surgery. I sure it's great for women."
2.0,Beautiful  but it doesn't open so you'd have to be a small child to fit this over your hand/wrist.
2.0,This doesn't have functioning buttons.
2.0,"This watch is a classic, but if you have man-sized wrists, this won't work. It wears like a child's watch. Get the original g shock model for a few dollars more."
2.0,Beautiful fabric but had to return as skirt was waaay too large. I know this is suppose to be a 'sweeping skirt' but was too much.
2.0,"Be careful, if you want the bike basket, the $39 one for sale is the shopping basket only. The bike mount is not included. I purchased for my daughter, and there was no handlebar mount included. Descriptions don't make this clear. Looked all o er the Internet for a handlebar mount, to no avail. I will have to figure out something else..."
2.0,They run too small and ive ordered 2 pairs and they sent me both times a smaller size than the one ordered! The shoe itself is really nice...
2.0,"Clasp comes off the leather really easy, can't wear it unless I glue it"
2.0,The seatbelt fabric folds on the middle with such a narrow strap
2.0,I gave it away.
2.0,kind of cheaply made for the price.
2.0,"This shirt fit really well, but did notice that it is cotton, so once it's washed it likely will be too small. The color is not as it is online. Ordered the green but what came looks black, so returned. Disappointed with the difference compared to what is pictured in the product pictures."
2.0,"This hat is cute, and you can flip the bottom (striped) part down to fit baby as she grows, but the gray radiation-blocking fabric doesn't seem to offer much coverage of the head. This is disappointing, because I bought this hat for coverage, not looks!"
2.0,"Really tiny, tiny, tiny.  Don't use them often."
2.0,"Have bought red coral like this before, but this time, I'm not sure if they are real or not.  As I was working with them, they felt soapy, so I washed them. Much of the color left and I ended up with med to light red stones. Only good things were, received on time, and packet well. Would I buy again,  not realy sure I will."
2.0,"so....  i washed in cold after i got, then my son wore to school for pajama day.  he came home and looks like the print by the knees have been rubbed off!  i was hoping it was just dust or something like that so i washed...  after only 2nd wash and 1 wear i now have a VERY light black and red camo print on the knees only...  i like the fit but the print rubbing off was really unexpected.  so not too happy with this purchase.  Since i already washed and wore cant return."
2.0,It was not the right size I was looking for. It was a gift and used for money however it is so stiff not much money fits in it.
2.0,Wouldn’t purchase it again. I’m an adult and we full time in our RV. My wife cuts my hair and it barely fits over my head and won’t hold its shape. Cheap and not worth it.
2.0,Box was open not sure if it matters but also the date on the back if that’s an expiration date they have expired. Also not a fan that it was open because in my line of work I need to be as sterile as possible especially in these times
2.0,"I was so excited for these but they arrived and are cut too low to wear socks with (can't work with the Chicago winters!). I'm normally a size 7.5 but these were too small, too."
2.0,"The dres itself is beautiful, not quite as stunning as the pic makes it but idk what others have to say but I know my daughters size and ordered one above anticipating a slight difference, but it was so small that the back side wouldn’t even zip. I read in the description to be true to size , simply not the truth. It was bought for my 7 yr old to wear at her birthday event , luckily bandy dad was able to make a matching top bow that went good with the back side waist line bow.. if your reading and considering to order, please order 2 sizes up, if your child is a 7-8 order 10-11 . It may require slight tucking in some places but better that then to small.."
2.0,"These belts are inexpensive, and the leather is fine. But the three independently operating belt tongues are difficult to use quickly and easily. You get two in, and the third one goes astray. You get the third one back under control, and the first one pops out. It's a whole lot more fuss and bother than you should have to deal with when you are just trying to put on your pants."
2.0,I have this dress in gold and a medium and it fits perfectly. I love the cut and style of this dress so decided to order it in black. It’s way too small. I returned and may reorder it in a large to see if that fits better.
2.0,Super hard to get air through the mask for intense aerobic activities.
2.0,I dont get the rubber so called adjustable piece's.  They are always falling off. I wish I knew it was like that before I bought them.  I wouldn't buy them.
2.0,"I rode down the street less than a 1/4 mile and the stitching here the index finger is located blew out and started coming undone. I've sent them back and wouldn't recommend this brand to anyone. They look cool though, but at a cost of not holding up."
2.0,"Something is wrong. It has 2 strings to tie it, but I cannot figure out how. There is a loop or something missing. As is, it ties like a robe, would be extremely inappropriate. 😱 for $9 I didn't expect a $90 dress, but a loop or something to tie it up right would be nice. I cannot wear it in public. My hubby doesnt mind it though lol"
2.0,"Not like the picture, the strings you tie in the back on not tassels and the material is thin and cheap."
2.0,Don’t believe what you hear.  I am in a mask all day long and this spray has not prevented my glasses from fogging up.  I still have to either take off my glasses or go outside to get a breather so my glasses don’t fog up.
2.0,They are cute and look just like the picture. Problem is that beads started coming off as I was pulling them out of the package. The beads are so tiny so you're not able to save them. Beads came off the yellow and red pair. The blue pair was ok..so far.
2.0,"It wasn’t the right photo, mine had a butterfly not a bird. The actual necklace part is smaller than I thought it be, and the metal beading is kinda big"
2.0,"Very beautiful, lovely design. But unfortunately it is VERY prickly. Not at all soft. I can’t use it. If you have sensitive skin or any level of sensory sensitivity — this will drive you bananas with how uncomfortable."
2.0,The large was too small as equivalent size was not clearly listed.  I have to return them.  My boyfriend loves the style though.
2.0,Bought XL based on the suggestions but I am swimming in these shorts because they're too big.
2.0,The mandrel is nice but the rings are in Hong Kong size (which there aren't exact conversions for) which was nowhere in the product description.
2.0,The product was not as it stated on site. I would not get this for anyone other than a kid. I will be not shopping with them in the future.
2.0,Liked the item but broke within a couple weeks :(
2.0,"This was the most frustrating ordering process i have ever experienced. I spent a great amount of time looking through cross bracelets on Amazon. Finally, i decided on the ""Spiritual Honesty Bracelet,""  shown above  this written review. I liked the black or brownish colored one and figured that i would be able to get either one of those two. Anyway, about a week after ordering, i received an email from the owner asking me to choose a color of the bracelet that i prefer (huh, i though it should have been mailed by now). Trying not to be annoyed, none of the colors she listed was any of the colors from the advertised picture. I responded by asking her about the black bracelet and she said they were sold out and that she would not be getting anymore in for a few weeks. So after emailing back and forth a few times and a couple of days later, finally i felt pressured to make a decision and decided to just choose a color from the list which was a blue color and something that i have not seen (i would have never bought this knowing this would happen). Since we are talking ""Honesty"" i honestly wanted a refund. So trying to be a good sport, i convinced myself that I would like the bracelet either way and i'm helping someone with her business. Once i received the bracelet nearly 2 weeks later, i was very unsatisfied with the product & the beads look cheap (definitely not a $15.00 bracelet). The reputation of this business is two thumbs down and i would not recommend anyone to purchase from OH LA LA (the owners name). When i ordered the product, i do not remember seeing anything stating that the bracelets in the picture may not be available. This needs to be clear when ordering, i may have missed important information when ordering but i doubt it."
2.0,"In general, nice legging but after washing it the seams on the side became itchy. Not terribly itchy but enough to not buy it again or recommend it."
2.0,Might be OK for fishhook earrings but stud earrings will not adapt with these.
2.0,I bought this for a replacement for a simple black one. I was disappointed that the green is not more prominent on the under side. It is hard to properly align the holes for the band to be connected. It also popped off after running into something (that could have been a user error the first time for not securing the pins right).<br /><br />Its a little hard for to get the 2 prong metal attachment out of the band when I take it off. I think this will loosen up over time though
2.0,Repeat customer here. I am usually very satisfied with the quality of these products but this one was a letdown. The merkaba on front was warped and misshapen and the components on the back were poorly cut and placed.
2.0,"The back looks great, but seemed like they didn't do the front properly. Looks like to backs sewed together and the front is wide, and gives me camel toe! Hate it"
2.0,smaller than I thought.
2.0,"for the price of the product it didnt meet quality standards<br />mask was very thin and flimsy,  the paid would chip off and the straps came un-sewn when trying it on for the 1st time.<br />best to just purchase a 3d print model of the mask for about the same price"
2.0,"I purchased this briefcase for my husband after he landed his new job at a very successful law firm and I realized he was carting his lunch and daily necessities back and forth from the office in a plastic tote bag from a local grocery store, and that just wouldn't do. I was so pleased with the briefcase when it arrived and so was my husband; the leather was supple, the strap and handles felt good and sturdy, it was more than roomy enough for his needs without becoming bulky or cumbersome, and it looks really nice with his suits.<br /><br />Well, that changed today, when one end of the strap came completely detached from the side of the case, after just seven weeks of normal use. Thank God for the handles, without which he wouldn't be able to continue to use it, but it's extremely obnoxious and now he's carrying an obviously damaged bag, which is not a good look and defeats the entire purpose of having bought him this briefcase to begin with. So, it gets a couple stars for looking really nice and being quite spacious, but it's absolute crap for strength and durability."
2.0,"The buttons and fabric started falling apart at the first wear, not even the first wash. The button fell off and i saved it to try to sew it Back on but after the first wash the detailing at the top had completely fallen apart.<br />This is a cute top but only for 1/2 of a use. I didn’t even get one full wear of it."
2.0,They run small so buy a size up. Make sure you wash by hand or they will fall apart at the seam line
2.0,The manufacturer needs to pay closer attention. The clasp that holds the pendant to the chain was on backwards!
2.0,"We ordered this mask for Halloween for my son,  it broke  as we unpacked it. It was nice quality just very disappointed it was so brittle."
2.0,It's cute but the green dye of the shamrocks bled into the white.
2.0,Cute top but fit too small (chest &#34;falls&#34; out on top) & I waited too long to return
2.0,"This suit is very simple and stylish, and looks almost identical to the photo. Unfortunately, the sizing options are a problem for me and I'm assuming many other women! I am about 5'4&#34;, 135 lbs, and mostly wear size 8 jeans (sometimes can squeeze into a 6, sometimes have to go up to a 10). My swimsuit tops are usually size S or M, while bottoms are usually L. So, I ordered an XL in this suit, hoping the adjustable top would be okay and that the bottoms would be big enough. They are TINY! I held them up and laughed at the size, because they looked like a S at largest. The bottoms are not stretchy whatsoever, and there are no larger size options. I'm disappointed because I love the suit, if only the sizing was more practical for girls with bigger hips/bottom halves. I'm planning to give the &#34;xl&#34; bottoms to my friend (she's size 2/4) and wear the top with plain black bottoms. Bummed!"
2.0,Watch came broken had to figure out how to put it back together not worth the price
2.0,Flimsy lens
2.0,"For the price I expected more. They came as they look but very very lightweight and stiff, no cush!"
2.0,"Ordered a khaki. It looks much more pale than what is shown in the picture. It looks like the picture was taken through a dark filter. Needed a corduroy jacket so I am going to keep it, but not happy about deceptive advertisement."
2.0,"This is an cute suit but it runs incredibly small and it is very short in the torso, like a petite. I went up 3 sizes (on 3 orders and returns) and it still didn't fit right, then I just gave up."
2.0,Only tried on the bra.  I used the sizing chart and other customer reviews when ordering. The bra was way too big on me. I returned.
2.0,Stone is much thinner than any Larimar I've purchased in the past. Keeps falling apart due to cheap and flimsy links which in my opinion are too small holding the piece to the chain. I know I will eventually lose it.
2.0,Velcro on the back of my neck. I get that it's supposed to resemble acus but Velcro was the worst part of those too. It also is not adjustable and hangs way too low. I definitely won't be wearing it but may find another use for it. The quality is good and it looks nice.
2.0,Totally not what I was expecting. The shorts are so long its almost seems as though they are capris. The material is very cheap. If it didn't come from China I would have returned it but don't feel like waiting 2 months for a refund.
2.0,"I have two issues here, the first far more concerning:<br />1: The hamsa that is printed on the circle piece in the photo is nothing but a blob. I bought this to help with my kid, for confidence around nightmares as the hamsa is a protective symbol. There is no hamsa anywhere on the bracelet.<br />2: It is very small. I bought it for my 9 y/o and I was afraid it wasn’t gonna fit her. It did, but it would not go on my wrist though."
2.0,Broke after dropping phone once
2.0,very cute but the snap broke after a week of owning it so I couldn't close it.
2.0,Very thin material and legs are very long for a tall person
2.0,Im a true medium but decided to get the large just to be on the safe side. Unfortunately although the design was super cute the sizing is way off and the large fit like an extra small. Only thing that fit was the sarong— I can only imagine how tiny the small or medium are. I would say this is only for small and extra small ladies.
2.0,"Okay so these are just adjustable adult headphones. I could wear them and so could my 2 year old. It's just the headband that's adjustable. And quite honestly, they are hard to adjust and maneuver and then get to stay in place before I can even get them on my little man's head. They have great sound protection but I expected them to be miniature versions of ear muffs. But they're the same size as the adult ones."
2.0,Stretch out terrible!!!
2.0,You get what you pay for. These are inexpensive and look like it. I would be embarrassed to give them to somebody. Colors are nice though.
2.0,"Didn't like , very much disappointed"
2.0,"Shoulder holes are pretty big, kinda awkward, neckline is high up looking funny.  I've learned this week not to buy clothes on-line<br />*UPDATE * started to unravel after 1st wash"
2.0,"I’ve had this wallet for about a month and a half and in that time it has served me well. However, when I went to unzip it today the zipper came off along with one of the metal tabs, rendering it impossible to put the zipper back on. Now this wallet is useless to me, as I can’t close it"
2.0,This top runs really big.  I returned it because it wasn't flattering at all.
2.0,This is too thin to work w/ an original Tag Heuer deployant buckle.  I am constantly tightening it as it slips down the strap.  The look and feel are good.
2.0,"The necklace was in good condition when it arrived, but it wasn’t white as pictured. It was mostly beige with a few white beads. I returned it."
2.0,I thought it was good idea to have band around my head. It does not stay while working out.
2.0,"This watch looks well made and is sent with a great presentation.  The  316 stainless steel band on this inexpensive watch is what attracted me, but the hard mineral crystal lens is what sold me on it. I was very happy with my purchase for a few days. Unfortunately the lens is not what they claim. I worked an event for 10 days where I was required to wear a wrist band. 4th day into the event I thought my watch lens had some sort of smootze on it, but it turned out to be scratched up.  I have worked this event annually for over 20 years and have never had an armband do this to a watch lens. I asked around and no one else appeared to have the same issue. The date was near enough to impossible to see before, now it can not be read at all due to the blurring of the lens from the scratches. I am disappointed.  I believed the watch was made as they claimed and now 15 days after getting it I  find myself in search of another watch."
2.0,"Large is still made tiny , for a size 2 girl"
2.0,"These remind me of a slightly nicer version of those cheap mesh tanktops you used to wear in the 90s. But the seams are way more uncomfortable.<br /><br />These do not stretch at all. They're just old school mesh with big holes cut in them to air out. Everyone seems to love these so it must just be me, but I thought they were a little uncomfortable. Mostly the seams ruining it on the back for me. Also the tank tops seem to ride up a but in the front, but could be a size thing.<br /><br />I got XL, and i'm 6'3"" and about 225. Probably shoulda done XXL. Returning for something else, not a new size though."
2.0,The clasp broke on it after wearing it for a little while.
2.0,I ordered this because my daughter needed a hooded sweatshirt that was warm but not winter-coat warm.  This was the most reasonably priced one I could find.  It looks nice but the quality just doesn't seem great.  I'm sure it will last for a while but it just wasn't quite what I expected.  I suppose it's ok for the price.
2.0,Love the color but one of the straps are seen on wrong so it is twisted and didn't notice until after I washed it probably won't be able to wear it because of this sad really pretty swimsuit other than that fit well.
2.0,Did not really like how it looked on and the material was not that great.
2.0,"These robes are lovely upon receipt ... however, they are not practical because of the washing instructions:  Do not tumble dry;<br />Line dry.  The unicorn hood doesn't like to be laundered."
2.0,Cheap material poorly sewn.
2.0,"Dress isn't breathable, wished I would have went with a different fabric"
2.0,"Para una talla 4 se ve chiquito el vestido, y la parte de abajo no es tan ancha como se ve en la foto, por eso no luce tan lindo, vendan los artículos como se ve en la foto."
2.0,"A year and a half later, the ends attached to the watch are bent and look about to come out. Also, the latching mechanism doesn't hold anymore so I've had my watch fall off and regularly have to re-close it. This is an all-metal product so for it to be failing this badly so quickly, it's clear that it was made cheaply though I guess it was cheap to begin with at ~$14 :/"
2.0,Did not hang very naturally off the shoulders.
2.0,"Poorly sewn, cheap materials, ugly colors - might last a week."
2.0,Its very simple
2.0,"Gave 2 stars since I got it on a deal of the day. Had I paid full price it would be 1 star. Fits well but material is very rough, not the slightest bit soft. Do yourself a favor and buy eddie bauer or American eagle. Don't pay a premium price for this. I'm sure even Walmart stuff would be more comfortable."
2.0,Shirt is not the same style and color.
2.0,Pretty but it broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,I didn’t have it long. The strap on it broke off. Disappointed
2.0,"First the dress is not as long at it is in the pictures, the Material is super thin. Im 5'7 and am the type of person that if i wear a long dress it needs to be long and not above my ankle."
2.0,They were cheap and turned my daughters fingers green
2.0,Its fit well.
2.0,I was really excited to get this as it had been out of stock for a while! However I am very disappointed. It is very cute but way too small and NO stretch! If you order an XL it fits like a medium. It is a thin material. Not a sweatshirt at all! It arrived on time and colors were as shown.
2.0,It was not the size we ordered so it doesn't fit him but the belt is classy. And my husband loves them and will only wear this style
2.0,Don’t like the fabric too slinky.
2.0,OK but not what I was looking for
2.0,"These are so small, I can't say how many sizes to order larger in order to fit. Very, very small. It's rate of 2 comes because I love the design of these shorts, and I wish they could have came in my size."
2.0,"Could not get them over my calves.  If you have big calves, do not get these socks."
2.0,"There is a funky gap in the front of the bra. It is very noticeable underneath a shirt, especially when leaning forward. The clips are hard to snap as the the pads are kind of stiff. I bought this to wear to Baby Yoga but it was a huge pain in the you-know-what when I tried to nurse during the class. I should have returned it!"
2.0,soft but does not stay on. Can't return because the seller says that they are out of business
2.0,Very thin like a slip. See through. IMO not meant for public wear. More like lounge wear.
2.0,I returned this product. I felt that the material was very thin and the under t-shirt lines showed through too much.
2.0,These are ok for the price. They do look nice in the ears. Unfortunately I really wanted the white ones and they came broken but the rest of them seem to be ok.
2.0,These are in no way ‘sweatpants’.<br />They are a medium weight bouncy lounge material. The elastic waist is tighter than I expected for the description.
2.0,turned skin dark
2.0,"Okay quality, I wore a pair around the house for a day and the rubber traction spots were already beginning to wear off. With many years of dance training, I know I don't scuff my feet around when I walk. They run somewhat small as well."
2.0,Expecting more of a sweat shirt material
2.0,"I bought these because the reviews were good but these are to thin for me.  They are also super shiny, almost as if they have glitter. After first wash the edges are falling apart."
2.0,They are really cute but damages pretty fast. One week after I got the watch I hit my hand on the door and it feel apart
2.0,Cat rings face looks like a goofy alien not a cat. Look nothing like the picture advertised!
2.0,The breast cups for my 3xl were ment for a medium or large person. The coverage was quite indecent. Please know that if you purchase from here that you may have to improvise the top to fit you.
2.0,Poor quality cheap material.
2.0,"It was such a ill-fitted dress, I chose a size up for loose fitting. But the middle section was too tight for me. The size chart wasn't that helpful for me. It looked good on the picture, however its unfortunate that it didn't go with me."
2.0,Item is not true to size. very tight for a XL should be a M/L
2.0,Very nice but the lockinshpill can get stuck at the worst time risk of soil your underwear
2.0,"Was not the material I had thought, very stiff. Sent it back over two weeks ago and have yet to hear if it was accepted or get the refund."
2.0,It fits small and I ordered a size up. The dress would be great if it wasn't so see through. You'd have to wear a tight slip or a body contour because even white or nude undergarments you'd still see. The dress is cute if you can make it work. I returned it and they kept $5 for shipping. SMH
2.0,Fabric was a no for me. Think like a Halloween costume fabric. Showed every imperfection for a form-fit style. I returned.
2.0,These run small. My son is usually a 16. These fit more like a 12. The fit was odd too. The neck was big and the shoulder seam puckered.
2.0,Way too small.  Looks nice but does not  fit.
2.0,Too small for any adult head that tried it on. this is false advertising - fits a kid's head.
2.0,This product has very low quality since the glasses get apart easily.
2.0,"1. this is not a corset, its a body shaper at best.<br />2. &#34;short torso&#34; must mean slightly less than average torso. not actually short. Im 5-0 and it still goes down to mid hip when the top is directly under my breast.<br />3. the fabric does breath nicely but its scratchy.<br />4. the seams at the top and bottom of the corset are basically tourniquets. they lack the stretch that the corset panels have making awkward bulges in the skin above and below the corset, if you can even get them on.<br /><br />if you are looking for something to wear as a &#34;corset&#34;, this item is a waste of time. if you want a body shaper, It is also a waste of time because of the very visible seams and bulgy effect. If you are already very in shape and looking for something to just sort of hug you i guess it might work. . . . pretty sure it will still bulge though.<br /><br />Im my case I was recently pregnant and wanted a comfortable corset to wear to help support my damaged abdominal wall, it would probably work for that if the seams at the top and bottom weren't so stiff.<br /><br />Don't buy if you have fuller hips of an hourglass figure. It will not accommodate."
2.0,Very pretty but a little yellow discoloration around the trim
2.0,"I tried a handful of lavento sport bras and was a huge fan of them, so I decided to order this one since it had a cute criss cross design. It feels cheaper and thinner than the other ones and fit a little on the tighter side (I ordered the same exact size as my other ones)."
2.0,"Its all like a rubber plastic stuck together, pretty good detail though kinda sloppy, I was hoping it contained real sand but its like glitter stuck to the inside. Quite big and chunky to wear so I hung it in my car."
2.0,"Very pretty, but will not hang correctly on any chain. Always turns backwards."
2.0,"I've bought eight pairs of Jambu shoes, both their original brand and the less expensive JBU line.  So you can guess that I'm a big fan.  I walk around all day at work and this brand has the most comfortable and stable platform shoe last I've ever found.  In addition, their shoes have a unique style that often gets compliments.  HOWEVER, two of the pairs I bought were disappointing and that includes this pair.  The reason is that the  material used - I believe it's what they call vegan - was so stiff that it hurt.  On this bootie, the boot shaft is so stiff that it rubbed against my ankles causing abrasions that I hope won't turn into scars.  I like the style and the rest of the shoe is wearable, but because of the hard material around the ankle, I can't use the pair.  Not sure if other wearers had the same problem or if this particular pair was just defective or my ankles are to blame. Also, this style is from their JBU line, not the original Jambu version.  ."
2.0,"I bought this thinking it would be a nice business casual blouse for work. It is awful 🤣 it looks and feels like a pajama shirt with a collar. It's basic t -shirt material, super baggy and just hangs there. The sleeves are wide all the way down to the wrist so it looks ridiculous. So bummed I. Thought this would be so pretty. Returned asap."
2.0,It falls off your arm if you don't have the hair tie on it.  That kinda defeats the purpose. I like the idea of it and the look of it.  I plan on shopping around to find one that stays on your arm and that may hold two hair ties.
2.0,Love the material and everything about this dress except for the band at the top....way too small
2.0,Super low quality wig. I got it on sale would definitely not buy it full price. Probably wouldn’t even buy it on sale again. You can see the tracks but may still work well if you plan on wearing it with a hat. The loops that are there so you can adjust the size were sewn down so the hooks can’t go in easily. Disappointed.
2.0,So I'm giving this shirt a two stars less for the material and fit of the shirt and more for the fact I ordered a large and got a small.<br /><br />The shirt itself is of decent material and is pretty cute. However the sleeves are too sheer if you're trying to wear it to cover tattoos at work. Good for going out though.
2.0,"The Fascinator that I received was not made very well.  On the flowers, we're not attractive and the ribbon was flat.  Also the headband was on sideways instead of fitting the hat up.  It looks great in the photo and I was disappointed.  I am returning my purchase."
2.0,"Good fit, but the print and color seemed to be on the surface only and when stretched across the bust area, looked lighter than the rest of the dress."
2.0,Smaller than they look
2.0,Sole separated within 30 days of normal use
2.0,"Followed others on the sizing suggestion and ended up buying too big of a size. I wear a Med and got an XL and it was way too big on me. 1 would have sized up once. Even after washing it was big still. Also, if you're tall, it is way too short in the front. Don't bother. Material is thin and see through. Overall not impressed, definitely a pass for me."
2.0,This suit had a lot of material.  Love the color but the ruffles made be look bigger I have a similar suit and the fabric is not nearly as thick .
2.0,"I ordered my ring size, yet they were too small."
2.0,"Shirt is shorter than it looks online, otherwise, it’s cute. I would say it’s more like a Medium than a XL.."
2.0,"Metal is an ugly brass color, not silver"
2.0,I expected the material to be more of a t-shirt or undershirt type material and thickness. It is like  felt or something. And looks like it was hand cut buy a child.
2.0,The hat headband came in a timely fashion they had itself was well made looked great right among a glitter however the feather was week it was wrapped I had to go and buy additional feathers to embellish it I wasn't too happy about that
2.0,"The look of this bracelet is nice. Real leather. Magnetic clasp. However, that is where the good ends. I have large wrists. I was hoping that there was some give in the band... Nope. It is too big to only wrap once and too small to wrap twice. Some one else mentioned that this could also be a necklace in their review, that's a lie as well. Best part, as I was trying to figure out a way to not be completely disappointed in this product, the leather came out of the clasp. Done gorilla glue could fix it, but I have had it for 10 minutes. That's very disappointing. I will be returning this product and I recommend that IDF your wrists aren't danty toothpicks, avoid wasting time and effort on this product. I want to rate this product as a 1 star, but it does look as described. So, that wouldn't be very fair."
2.0,The buttons don't stay locked in. Which causes the time to be off or way off.
2.0,Sucks. Smells like some kind of bone treatment or something but I honestly don’t even think this one is actually made of bone. I got both this one and the 6.00$ one and the cheaper one is hands down the better pick. It looks more authentic and it fits better. Not at gaudy an bulky. Plus the “bone skulls” all look exactly the same while the 5.00$ bracelet the skulls actually look like bone and no two are the same showing they’ve actually been hand carved.... I will be returning this one. I just don’t understand why or how the one that’s almost half the price can and is SO MUCH BETTER then the one that’s double the price...? Amazon is funny sometimes
2.0,"Having larger hands, a substantial watch face is fine for me. However, the bezel on this is clunky and inhibits functionality of the actual watch. Very difficult to get the button pressed and swipe down is impeded by the thick border. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this. Too bad because the strap is great."
2.0,Was ok for Halloween but it was very itchy and I left a trail of feathers whoever I went since they kept falling out
2.0,A lot of the reviews mentioned the tees breaking easy...they do! They are cheap enough that if you wanted tees with a patriotic theme you can buy them but they do break easy. Figure on 2 to 4 tees breaking per round.
2.0,Ugh too<br />Small
2.0,Ordered a 3t. Pants were about 3 inches too short.
2.0,It was very cute but broke the frist time u wore it
2.0,Too light can easily lose & cramped spaceeven with bare min.
2.0,Really nice looking except the arrows fell off the backing
2.0,"a packet full of cheap trash. I can wear only 2-3 of them. the rest look very low quality (unlike on the photos, where they appear far more substantial). Disappointed."
2.0,"So I loved it at first - it felt more comfortable than original silicone apple watch band.  Then I noticed that when i put my wrist flat on the desk to type on keyboard - the plastic peace(it has quite sharp corners) on the bottom of the band was digging into my skin. This basically made the band very uncomfortable to wear...<br />Also , when I just took the band out of box and stretched it a bit - the metal loop just flew off. Had to put it back on, was pain in the ass, kind of need to use needle to make it easier to put it back on.<br />Maybe I did not put it back together correctly but it doubt it, the adjustment worked fine. On their product pictures though looks like that plastic piece is not there..."
2.0,Looks pretty but in person it’s not a great quality.<br />I got 3 xl but was still tight around the bust .I returned it.
2.0,"I thought I ordered a SMALL and received a 2XL!!! Not sure where the miscommunication came in but I'm not reordering, didn't like the quality.  Way cheap looking!"
2.0,This was not flattering for the thicker built body. The modest neck line and sleeves made arms look bigger and overall big.  The cutting and material looked too cheap. I would wear this around the house rather than going out.
2.0,"These pulls looked great when I received them.  I got them to replace worn out zipper pulls on a small purse.  However, the first two I used broke within a week -- it was the link of chain between the clasp and the pull, so no fixing it.  The third and fourth ones have held for a few weeks, so they may work for a while."
2.0,"Decent quality at best, but no targeting piece.  Don't your money."
2.0,Doesn’t look of fit like the photo shows
2.0,Its not for safety against the covid virus.  To thin. It's more of just a prop.
2.0,Beware plastic not a sew on patch
2.0,"I bought this as my wedding band to go with my 14k rose gold engagement ring. At first the color matched beautifully, and was fantastically shiny (very comfortable too!). Sadly, after wearing it for about 3 weeks, the rose color started to disappear and the ring is a not-terribly-pretty yellowish gold color (kind of midway between yellow gold and rose gold, but darker than it ought to be). It wasn't looking nice with my engagement ring anymore so I stopped wearing it (I switched to the same MJ Metals 3mm ring but in white tungsten, which has been great so far but isn't the ring blessed during my wedding ceremony *cry*).<br /><br />My husband has the MJ Metals 5mm white tungsten band and it's been great, holding up really well during his job as a postman. I wish I had listened to other reviewers who said the rose color wore off, and just went with the white tungsten right from the beginning."
2.0,"For this jacket to be a 3X. My 13 year old who is a rather thick girl, and wears a 16-18 was  not comfortable in this jacket my other daughter fits an extra large and it fit her just right. So i feel they need to do better on the sizing"
2.0,This bra is okay but I will probably only get a few wears out of it before it’s not sticky. Hard to apply and doesn’t work as you’d expect. May as well use nipple covers instead of this huge sticky bra
2.0,Nothing special for the price
2.0,"The design is cute, but I can tell the material will fade after time. VERY hard to properly fold up and place back into the pouch it comes with. Once I got it out it was almost impossible to put it back in the pouch. The stitching on the pouch almost broke, might have to return it."
2.0,"I am giving this item a 2 star rating because of the deceptive information in the description...<br /><br />Was looking for polarized sunglasses...<br /><br />Found this seller advertising this item... I was attracted to the purple framed glasses...<br /><br />Received them today... They are beautiful... Having bought many pairs of polarized sunglasses from Amazon lately, several of them came with a little card used to test the glasses to see if they are polarized... As you can see, the red framed glasses are polarized; the black framed glasses are polarized, but, the purple framed glasses that this seller is selling are NOT polarized!!!"
2.0,"These were the perfect size, really cute. I used one for a cartilage piercing in my ear. I wore it for a week before it fell out. The second one also lasted about a week before it fell out. I do not recommend these if you're looking for something permanent."
2.0,"This dress has a weird fit at the hips, as if the designer didn't know what shape a woman's body is. But the fabric is nice. I'm having it altered professionally, because other than the very odd shop of the dress, it is very nice."
2.0,They were great but one was delivered broken
2.0,"I love the design of this shirt. However, the fabric is thin and not the soft t-shirt feel I expected."
2.0,"This band is exceedingly frustrating.  It constantly comes unbuckled, despite secondary retaining loop I added.  It falls off throughout the day and whenever I remove a jacket.  Also, it comes disconnected from the body of the watch regularly.  Do not purchase this.<br />**I rated it a 2 because it is very comfortable but only for the few minutes it will stay on."
2.0,"The size and color are nice! I love it.<br />However, super thin material...<br />It's really really thin. That's kinda disappointing, sadly.<br /><br />Maybe I'll only use it in mid-summer!?"
2.0,a string goes up your hooha and it doesnt cover your breasts properly
2.0,"Unfortunately they fell off first time outside, not sure if heat and humidity plays factor. They were installed as instructed to a pre cleaned surface and let to dry overnight."
2.0,It was to small to be used as a mala.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, because it's so light but weight. It is super staticky, sonic clings.  The side left seam also ripped the second wash."
2.0,"My daughter loved these to go with her Sofia dress. Unfortunately, the amulet fell off the beads immediately, easy fix. On day 2 the crown headband part broke. Really disappointed. We have other plastic crowns that have lasted years. Was expecting more than a day and a half."
2.0,"It didn't irritate my face, and it fit perfect until I washed it then it shrunk and now it's to small.. 😢"
2.0,"Got this as a personal joke and didn't expect too much, however, I did expect it to run properly.  Within 2 days it stopped keeping normal time...it just has its own agenda.  I knew I was getting what I paid for but I did expect it to run a little longer.  Oh well, live and learn."
2.0,"I ordered a size larger that I usually do.  The top fit just right, So they MUST run small.  Soft stretchy fabric.  But NO cotton as advertised. The bottoms (pants) were waayyy to long (about 6 inches!) I also did not think they looked attractive.  They are being returned."
2.0,"Doesn’t fit right, runs small, length too short."
2.0,It's was alright I guess
2.0,A BEAD FELL OFF AS SOON AS I OPENED THE PACKAGE
2.0,"The bracelet was too small for my wrist did not fit, but I like the look of it."
2.0,"I usually wear a medium in everything but went with a large because I’ve noticed some active on Amazon runs small- the waist fit well the legs were a little loose. Maybe the loose legs would have been fixed by sizing down. But the material was a little more stiff  than I would have liked so I didn’t think sizing down would be comfy. Also, when I pulled these up to the part of my waist I like them at…. There was an “issue” with the center front seam if you get my drift. I ordered the teal in a large- oh man, the color was beautiful but I’ll be returning.<br /><br />For fit- I’m 5’5” on a good day, range from 158-165, carry some weight in my tummy but have an hour glass figure.  I wear a medium bottoms from old navy, and size 8 from AE."
2.0,Well it keeps me dressed.
2.0,"The non traditional style of rings started breaking the first day and by the end of my 4 day use, I had about 3 rings left."
2.0,"shirt fit fine, very pretty and well made, but it was too short.  it also was supposed to button at the neck, but literally only fit halfway around my neck and wouldn't even fit my cat.  lol"
2.0,Has a stupid blue reflective coating on rear of lens. you can see your eyes the whole time in light or dark. terrible for driving. creates chromatic aberrations. very dangerous. The look is very nice but thats al it has goin for it. Nose pieces were rattling and cheap.
2.0,Wide shoe for a Narrow width.
2.0,"It’s so light you can’t read what it say,  very disappointed bought for my mom for Christmas<br />The description made the engraving look dark and it’s not"
2.0,These are definitely NOT snow pants in a typical snow pants sense. They are more like lined jogging pants. They run very small! I bought a size up for my son who is much smaller then the average 11 year old and they are about 3 inches short. He is actually shorter then a majority of kids his age for size reference. I do think they would be good for if you were outside playing on a cold day. I cant say even if they fit I'd be confident enough to use them as snow pants
2.0,Nice saying but very hard to read.  Kind of flimsy too.
2.0,"I ordered this in the navy and the beige. They are made completely different, out of 2 completely different materials. Probably won't wear either of them because the side comes up too high. Waste of money."
2.0,"This is tiny! I should have read the measurements because I was expecting a key chain sized sloth to arrive. This is smaller than a dime. The sloth picture is cute, but way too small"
2.0,Didn't do a squat for me. Also too long.
2.0,Reported itchy and not forgiving in fit
2.0,I don't know why but this shirt is very itchy. Its driving me crazy and the writing and pumpkin are in the plastic junk that doesn't wash up well.
2.0,I did not like product.
2.0,"I am 145 pounds, 5'10"" tall, with 35 inch inseam.  Small waist, and not big hips. Length was too short and 2 inches above ankle bones.  Material was see through as well.  Length was unsatisfactory in the medium I ordered.  I should have gotten a large.  But I think that length would have still been too short."
2.0,These are nice but there is almost no room upfront in the pouch. I'm not that big and stuff is definitely more than a little smashed. Will keep looking for some good thongs.
2.0,"We had this watch for less than a day when the loop on the strap broke off (the part that secures the extra length of strap).  The manufacturer kindly exchanged it for us, but now, less than 4 months later, this ""waterproof"" watch has fogged up and stopped working.  This wasn't even used for swimming, so I'm disappointed that the waterproofing could fail so easily.  I just e-mailed the manufacturer again and will update this review based on their reply.  My daughter loved the look and fit though (she's an 8-year-old with a small wrist)."
2.0,The box toe rubbed as soon as I put them on. The sides fit loosely and doesn't have any shape. Will be returning. Very dissatisfied.
2.0,"I have the biker short from this company and love them, I've never had any issues with them. Bought the leggings and they were too big on my waist and I went to pull them up onto my hips and it tore the lining of the leggings up at my hip. All in all for a couple of bucks they're not bad but you get what you pay for but you get what you pay for here."
2.0,It fit perfectly but was very very disappointed in this purchase. It smelled horrible like a musky person. Also I didn’t receive a belt with it.
2.0,"The shape on these were a bit off, and that makes sense as to why they were on such a great sale. They are being returned."
2.0,I will be returning these. I purchased 3... They are charms for a bracelet but are larger than my thumbnail.  They are huge!  I was so disappointed as I really wanted an Oma charm and really liked the look of this one.
2.0,Would have given 5 stars but zipper broke the first week.
2.0,"Ity Bity.  Very disappointed in the sizing, I ordered a medium, it is more like an extra small."
2.0,Within one month the layers of the strap are separating.
2.0,Didn't work out for me
2.0,"Cute shirt but way too big. I am 5'8&#34; 140 pounds for reference. I followed the size chart and ordered a large, but it looked like a trash bag with no shape. Returned it"
2.0,"Beautiful, stylish sunglasses; however, they’re cheaply made. Honestly, I’d prefer to pay an extra few dollars and get better quality glasses."
2.0,Came too small and quality is not so good.
2.0,This item is cute but it's thin. It is a little large as well.
2.0,Pretty ring but turned my finger green in three days. :(
2.0,Fabric and style are great.  For was to small according to chart.  Go for next size up if you plan to buy.
2.0,Cute outfit for working out at home. Material is very thin and see through. I would not wear this out to the gym. Bra is light support. I would not recommend this for high impact activity.
2.0,"The size I bought was a medium and that was too small, I love the dress and the color just need to get a bigger size."
2.0,"The material is very see thru and the Sequins fall off all over the place. I would look for something else. Unfortunately, my return window has closed, so I can't even return it."
2.0,Got as a gift in 2017. Did not last 6 months before a pin broke. Glad they aren't selling them anywhere anymore as they don't last. Loved it while it worked.
2.0,"I Personally did not care for this dress, at all The material seemed too thin, too light weight. I didn’t Like the way it hung on me It just didn’t fit well"
2.0,It is actually a pretty bag but the picture and description are not adequate. It is large. Colors are grey on one side and white on the other. Handles are black. That is a lot of color for one handbag. I also think it would be improved with a different closure.
2.0,It shrunk a little on the first washing. What’s worse was that the design was partially washed out even though the shirt was placed inside out before that first wash. I do not recommend this product at all.  Other tees from other companies washed out much better
2.0,Wrong color.... more of a white gray... thanks charcoal gray shown....
2.0,"This looks great, but I have had one of the pins fall out  two separate bracelets after only a couple of weeks of normal use. I figured the first one was a fluke and I re-ordered the same one, unfortunately the pin came out even faster on the replacement band. I couldn’t find the pin in either case to even attempt to repair it myself as the pin is really tiny."
2.0,3x is more like a Large to extra large!
2.0,Es bonita queda igual que la auténtica pero tiene un fallo que el tornillo se afloja solo. Y se suelta.
2.0,The shirt is not as casual as it seems. It’s a typical button down just paper thin. Really disappointed
2.0,"I ordered these because I use a lot of essential oils and natural (homemade) cleaning solutions. I bought them  while ago and didn't use them til recently. Every time I use them the spray plunger gets stuck in and I have to pull it out to get it to spray. I bought a different bottle - 16 oz not 8 oz, and amber - from the same seller but the spray attachment was different and they work perfectly."
2.0,Very cheaply made and not flattering.  Looked much cheaper material wise than the photos.
2.0,It doesnt even lock -_-
2.0,"No corresponde bien la talla ,la falda parece ser xl y la blusa s"
2.0,I loved it for about a week. I bought it to take on vacation. While the outside shell is good quality by the third day of my week vacation the plastic clip to close the wallet broke and I had to keep it closed with a rubber band. Very disappointed!
2.0,The mesh bags were of poor quality
2.0,Not what it looked like in person compared to the photo online.
2.0,Got one in the pack that a xl then a 2x and two of the shirts have holes in arm pits after one wear and wash and all 6 shirts shrunk they feel like small now
2.0,"My review for my first order is below.  These hipsters turned out to be comfortable and durable, so I ordered more (I got used to the gigantic block letters on the waistbands).  Unfortunately, in this new order, the same size I ordered before is too small!  Comparing them side by side with the first order, these are about 1/2"" smaller all around.  And, only three of the colors in the ""Winter"" selection are as pictured.  The other three colors are way off.<br /><br />[Review of first order:]<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, these do run large.  And, not that it really matters on utilitarian briefs like these, but the manufacturer's details, printed on the inside of the waistband, are in big, dark, block letters.  See pic.  So, now where am I supposed to write my name with a Sharpie, before I go off to summer camp?"
2.0,Definitely not what I was expecting
2.0,"We saw these on another child and thought they were very cool. We got them for our daughter for Christmas. Sadly, they only worked sporadically and even then only for a few days. We’re super disappointed. I wish they worked well."
2.0,Actually love the ear rings but they came without backs.  frustrating
2.0,"Beautiful, but did not last long.  The little screw that keeps the clasp with the fit bit in it fell off.  Fortunately I did not lose my Fitbit because.  Going into my box of jewelry that I’ll probably never wear again because I have no idea where to get it repaired"
2.0,"Beautiful diamond studs however, I have lost the backs to the earrings already. They did not hold."
2.0,My waist is average and the belt kept sliding down to my hips.
2.0,Not sturdy at all looks great but broke after 3 wears by my 9 year old daughter.  Not worth the money
2.0,Not wgphat I expected.  The jewel is huge and less like jewelry than i was looking for to wear at work.
2.0,"I really liked this shirt overall, but the sleeves were very tight.  And I do not have large arms!"
2.0,plastic eye insert falls out easy but pops back in easy also
2.0,This Charm was tarnished when I received it. The picture displayed is not a good reinterpretation of how it actually looks
2.0,"My kid loved it, but its a very thin fabric. it would have been great if it had a pocket to insert the n-95 filter."
2.0,"Love the design on the pants and the shirt. But, we bought this in newborn size to be the outfit our son came home in and it is just now ""fitting"" him at 12 pounds. The body fits just right on the shirt but the arms are ridiculously too long. The pants fit okay around the waist and are again ridiculously too long. My baby is a bit on the small size according to the  growth charts. But he has always fit just right into other clothing sized for his age."
2.0,The dress was way too long.  Not what I expected.
2.0,I loved this dress the minute I put it on! It was very flattering and fun. I washed it on cold and took it out of the dryer and realized the pink had bled all over the white. I am so disappointed!!
2.0,Not a great shoe and doesn't fit well. I ordered the same as previous CH and it was at least 1/2 size larger. Leather is hard and causes blisters.
2.0,i ordered these boots for my daughter it took a long time to get them then they were the wrong size she has worn them 4 times and the balls on the laces have already fallen off not impressed.
2.0,Zipper broke 1st I'm trying to wear
2.0,"The fabric is super cute  but it has several ripped seems,  The straps are way too long and there's no way to adjust them.  There was a hole in the seam about an inch long in the front near the hem.  Luckily I'm handy and know how to sew. I was able to spend 30 minutes fixing holes and sewing ripped seems.  Otherwise the length of the fabric is good and the fabric itself is good, just really poorly put together."
2.0,"pretty, solid good quality...... too heavy tho before I even put anything inside!"
2.0,"Expected it to be yellow and black, for Hufflepuff, but it is yellow and NAVY. Disappointed."
2.0,1. The earrings don’t come with backs. 2. Don’t look anything like the first photo. 3. Are WAY bigger in person. I mean for the price it’s adequate but it’s sort of misleading.
2.0,Pidan una talla mas grande
2.0,too short and big
2.0,"Nice fabric, but it runs so small."
2.0,The smallest chain is very small. Looks cheap.
2.0,I ordered the maroon shirt and got a red/white shirt.  it is also shorter in the front than shown in the picture.  the one shown is so much cuter than what I received.  :(
2.0,Not the “rose gold” color pictured. Not remotely pink at all. Thick and heavy.
2.0,This is a very cute little jacket that I purchased for a Christmas gift. It is now April and the zipper is broken near the top. The return window is over so guess they won't stand behind their product.  I do not recommend this product.
2.0,"The watch strap felt great, fit wonderfully, and was mostly good, however I think wore it for two days and it broke on the second. I am very disappointed with the durability of this watch as it is supposed to be a very good watch for exercise, but I would be wary of it breaking where it connects to the watch face."
2.0,Gaiter mask looks nice. Material is very thin. Son cannot wear it to school because it's so thin. More decorative.
2.0,Too small for son. Size was off by like 3 sizes.
2.0,No está ni cerca a la foto parece un reloj de piñata
2.0,The paint chips off of the balls. I am very disappointed in this.
2.0,very very cheap looking
2.0,didn't like it as much in life as in pix. hubby liked it. it was for him
2.0,"We got these for the whole family (yes you have to order each set separately). The quality is cheap and the fit is awkward. The pants are too long for me, too tight for my sister. Will be returning"
2.0,"Not at all what I was looking for. More like a long underwear feel, thicker and tight. I wanted a shirt that was comfortable, breathable and not plastered to my skin."
2.0,I washed it according to directions and it shrunk to a child's size.
2.0,They came broke.
2.0,"I am a nurse and wear size 5-6 shoe. I ordered the small pair. The compression itself is good on the calves and ankle, however, the toe part is crazy tight. I literally cannot wear these socks. I wore them 4 times and each time, my toes were killing me that night and the next day. The last time, I didn't make it through my shift, I had to take them off and walked to the hospital gift shop to buy a pair of socks. They scrunch my big toe & second toe terribly."
2.0,"I wear a regular size ten but these shoes were a whole size too big! Very cute shoes, but not very secure either."
2.0,"It says for kids, but for my average 11 year old, they were way too long.  I ended up keeping them, only because they fit me and I'm xs women.  I use amazon for the convenience and since, returning is hassle and I ended up having to find a store in the area and purchase more pants for my daughter, i'm going with 2 stars"
2.0,I loved it and I was so excited!! Then it broke the first time I wore it. So I fixed it and it broke again so I fixed it again and it broke again. So I gave up. Boo.
2.0,Cuts off right at the belly button. If you have a little extra weight like myself it’s not flattering at all
2.0,Plain and boring
2.0,I like the straps as its not too thin and its comfortable enough where its not digging in my shoulders.  The band and the cup I feel is more than a little snug.  I've worn both bras in the pack thinking maybe it was just the first one but both bras caused bruising.  I think potentially if I ordered up it may have been a great buy...but I did not due to the other reviews of fits as expected/somewhat large.
2.0,Missing 2 stone's upon arrival.
2.0,I don’t like all the dangling stuff.
2.0,way bigger lenses than i anticipated. very costumey
2.0,Of all the astronaut costume we have all had sewed on patches ( have 3 but unfortunately all are too small).  The painted in patches and this price makes the costume look cheap.  Would not recommend this product.  The downside of shopping on line.
2.0,Larger than I expected.  I will exchange for something else.
2.0,"They were the color I was looking for, however advertised as polarized , but were not. I returned them."
2.0,Don’t buy<br />It’s super see through and the waist line is terrible loose fitting.
2.0,"Bases on the pictures and the reviews, the fabric looked much nicer than it actually is. It feels like thin swimsuit material (but thankfully isn't see through). It's also an awkward length and goes down too far on my legs (and this is coming from someone with a long torso) I bought this for my 2 year anniversary, but unfortunately it looks too cheap. Disappointed."
2.0,I love this brand and own at least 10 tops. This one does not have the stretch area on the back and was too small because of that. Order up
2.0,too small for above average head
2.0,"The Frame is the correct color but if your looking for the green tint as the lens color , it isn't correct. Plain black glasses. Fast delivery"
2.0,NICE COLOR. MATERIAL POOR QUALITY
2.0,"This isn't even worth a dollar. Came pre-tarnished, nearly as much black as silver color. I was expecting top quality, but this is not as pictured."
2.0,"These are NOT STAINLESS STEEL as posted on the product description.  They are very ugly, cheap and poorly formed PLASTIC."
2.0,They're cute but fits snug.
2.0,"Very cute, but not much support. I wear a 7 and ordered a 39, and the fit was right. The velcro kept coming off, and the foot bed was not very comfy.  You could add an insert, but it was too tight on the toes if I did that."
2.0,"After taking a really long time to get here, it was disappointing to find that it was a tight fitting cap. Not a one size fits all. More like a child/juvenile size cap."
2.0,It was waaaay to large!
2.0,"Oh my gosh this thing is a cheap piece of crap: it only has two tiny pockets, the inside of one has already ripped open into the jacket lining, the inside of one sleeve is longer than the other, and the zipper barely works. Also, as other reviews have noted, the lining material is.... some kind of velvet? Haha, wait, what!?!<br /><br />That said, I got this for less than half price of what an equivalent jacket would cost. The tag on it claimed it was supposed to sell for almost $100... i got it for $40. So it's maybe worth that... I kind of like it; it's sooo weird, it's warm, it fits, and it's velvet-ish.<br /><br />Don't buy it, it's crap. Unless you want a barely functional warm jacket lined with... velvet?"
2.0,"Cute print, but absolutely GIANT on me. I’m 5’3”, about 105-110 lbs. For someone larger, the smallest size would likely be cute though!"
2.0,Cannot clean because you are only supposed to “rinse” them without touching with fingers or cloth.
2.0,Two zipper pulls missing upon delivery. Wish quality control was on their game as this is intended to be a gift.
2.0,Coat already ripped along the whole seam on side two weeks after purchasing. Terrible quality
2.0,"Dress fits perfect, however,  the seem in the back came with two holes in it"
2.0,Bought this drunk. Was very surprised when it came in but they are very poorly constructed and around high school play quality.
2.0,the fabric does not breath well. They are comfortable but I cannot wear them for long. Would prefer cotton.
2.0,These discolor quickly after being worn.  Also one of the pairs fell apart as I opened the package and is unusable
2.0,"Very small, cannot hold a small phone."
2.0,I was really hoping this collar would be adjustable and usable for someone with a 19” neck. I read on here that someone with a 20” neck made it work. No luck here :/. I really liked the look of the collar too.
2.0,I ordered 1/2 size larger and could have gone with full size larger. If you are looking for a costume accessory these boots could work. I prefer some cushion in the sole which these are very much lacking. You get what you pay for with these.
2.0,What's wrong with using American sizes?
2.0,Band is too small.
2.0,I bought my son 2 of these and by the second wash the bottom seem of one jersey had completely unraveled and come out and the other jersey was unraveled about a quarter of the way around.
2.0,On the first washing the stitching on3 of the 5 of these unraveled in the wash and I had to re-sew before they were wearable.
2.0,"Disappointed, you can see through the dress."
2.0,Sent back. Didn’t fit as described. Itchy
2.0,Bought these for my 6 yr old daughter and they fit to tight. They are super cute tho.
2.0,"As the other reviewer stated, the picture clearly shows rubber soles for early walkers. I also received smooth-bottomed crib shoes.<br />Their size chart in the photos section is also inaccurate: it stated that their size 6.5 is for 12-18 months. These are impossibly huge on my 11.5 month old. To me they look like a true US toddler size 6???<br />I know these are cheap shoes, and i have left positive reviews on other pairs i have purchased from this seller, but no matter what the price point i expect to receive what is advertised. In this case i did not receive what was advertised."
2.0,Bought this almost two years ago as a cheap watch to take on trips.  It's totally dead now.  Wonder how long it was sitting in a warehouse.  Worked adequately while it was alive.  Lost a minute or two every month.
2.0,"It looks nice and is comfortable enough, but I am not a very big person and I feel the arms are too snug and possibly too short."
2.0,"This blouse should have fit, according to the sizing chart. In fact, it should have been on the large side. Nope. It wasn't. It doesn't fit and the material is thin. I liked the style and the color but was very disappointed that it was not wearable"
2.0,The pants are baggy in weird places and the shirts are tight. I’d also say the material isn’t great. I bought them for 4 kids and they all fit weird.
2.0,Two pair I tried on were ripped in the front. Cheap material.  Won't buy again.
2.0,Fabric looks cheap. Don’t look as good as in picture.
2.0,Too small and rashy. Not allergic to anything. Never got rashes from socks in 40+ years wearing them for football to construction to clerk jobs to armed forces marching to LEO work walking a 12.5 hour beat.<br />Got rashes on the ankle and top side metatarsal area. Took a week to go away. Sussed it was not any detergent thing. Been rocking Wisk since 19... like... forever.<br />Size is so small it felt like kid brother small.
2.0,"I love how comfy it is- like wearing a blanket. However the zipper gets stuck a lot, and the neck is SO hard to get to sit just right."
2.0,tight fitting and awkward length
2.0,"Very cheaply made.  Came with one of the belt loops unstitched and just sticking out.  Runs VERY small.  Fits like a petite.  I'm 5'9 130lbs.  Usually a size 4.  Bought a medium and the waist is just below my armpits.  I purchased last minute for a funeral up north.  Will have to make do, but very disappointing."
2.0,The rim of the dress is uneven and I thought that one of the sides was a bit too short for me.<br />I'm 5'7&#34; 145 lbs and ordered a Medium.
2.0,The bust line is tiny and difficult even for an average size woman.
2.0,"color wears off too easily, metal wears quickly too - too quickly for a kid charm"
2.0,It's very light weight and thin. For the value of the money NOT worth it. It's cheaply made. Porbably will not last long. Looks like something you can find at dollar store for the quality of it.
2.0,I returned this sweater just as fast as I received it. I ordered a small/medium and it fit like an XL. It was huge and looked like a square. Very see-through and thin material. Nothing like I expected. One good thing-color was pretty.
2.0,Feels like they will come off my back foot.
2.0,Great Design and fit the only problem is it is not real silver. Leaves a black ring on your finger which is typically a sure sign that it is not real silver very disappointed in this seller.
2.0,"The photo shows that the green belt is a bright apple green.  In reality, it's a dark forest green.  Otherwise, it's not a bad belt - though it does run small.  Seems like real leather.  But don't trust the photos when it comes to the color."
2.0,Must be a Chinese knock off. The quality was very poor. The black strips on the sleeves peeled off after the first use. Not even washed it.
2.0,"Really nice rich brown color, lightweight and decently made, but it is very floppy and interior is very dark so finding my things in it is difficult."
2.0,"Ordered this as a potential interview jacket, ended up returning. More of a stretchy material, like workout clothing. Textured. It was also somehow too big in the shoulders (I have HUGE shoulders so that was a surprise) and fit really loose, but was too tight in the arms."
2.0,they are very flimsy and don't fit quite well
2.0,"Okay.. The gold metal on the bag looks kinds cheap up close and I expected it to be a smoother black on the outside. The indside I'm not as happy with. The zipper in the middle is very cheap and will probably not last that long, and its not a solid divider so things in your purse can slide from one side to another. Not gonna lie though it was way larger than expected (to me) but it has space. Overall though this bag is nice and can be fancied up with accessories on the side since it is quite dull in my opinion<br /><br />Update: 2 weeks later the metal strap broke. Can't fix it."
2.0,"Wanted to love these shoes. Unfortunately, the toes really curl up and he seems to find them uncomfortable. One pair arrived with a hole in it. :/"
2.0,"Got as a gift for my husband. The leather is nice and soft. No smell and fits well. Husband is 5'10 and about 210lbs, he fit a large perfect.<br /><br />1/25/16 - Update on my review. I previously rated this jacket a 5 star but now I've rated it lower. Reason - Purchased this item for Christmas 2014 so my husband has had it for exactly one year now. First wearing he loved it and mind you that we live in an area that most of the year it's grey and rainy so he cannot wear often. Recently he noticed that he felt like something was poking through his shirt like a hair or something, come find out it was the stuffing that was in the lining. I have pictures to show, they're everywhere. I recently contacted the company and they're solution and reason of this happening - &#34;We have showed the images to our quality team and they said that the threads coming out due to rough usage of the jacket. You can cut these threads with the help of any scissor and use it.&#34; Uh no that's not a solution because it'll continue to poke out. So I won't be buying from this company again, the jacket wasn't cheap neither. Also my friend bought the same exact jacket but a year earlier and he doesn't have this problem with his. So if you don't care to pay this amount and for the threads to continue to poke you and come out then this is jacket for you :).<br /><br />&#34;We have noticed you have purchased this jacket a year ago on 19 Dec 2014. As per the amazon policy, we are only able to return the jacket within the 30 days.&#34; but they clearly state in each email that &#34;100% customer satisfaction is our utmost priority&#34; pshhhhh."
2.0,sizing runs really large.  I plan to send them back.
2.0,Size says 4-5 years old. This is not accurate. These gloves would fit your average 7-8 year old. Simply not going to fit the average toddler. It's a shame as the quality of the glove is very nice.
2.0,Would fit good if I had a long crotch
2.0,Pretty earrings but try not to drop them on a hard wood floor because you’ll likely lose a stone.
2.0,"Should have read the fine print I guess. Wrongly assumed since the picture was 2 hats, I’d receive 2 hats."
2.0,Did not last.  Broke in half.
2.0,The first one that was sent was not correctly.  The hands would get hung up on each other and the watch would stop.  The company took it back with no issues and delivered another replacement.  It is a sharp looking watch but doesn't keep time very well.  What do you expect for twenty bucks though.
2.0,for a girl not a woman..very small and tight. I am a size 4 so…made me look fat.
2.0,"I ordered a 2x so it would be oversized on me. It's too small for me but based on their measurements, I should've been a Large. It is also thin. I would've kept it if it fit though."
2.0,They dont stay up and are super long so you can't even tell what the Design is when your wearing it
2.0,"Good looking watch, nice band, but the analog time doesn't keep time well at all.  In an hour it will be off by ~5min, which is pretty awful.  Digital time works fine.  I'll be returning mine."
2.0,The bottoms are REALLY SLIPPERY! 🙄😑🤔😲☹️ PURCHASE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
2.0,It's too big to wear as a pendent so I just tuck it in my bra.
2.0,Color and fit true. The elastic in the waistband twists in the wash and is very difficult to straighten out after each wash.  Would not recommend.
2.0,"After trying this set on, I immediately put in for a return. The bottoms look subtle in the picture but is so bright it is dizzying. In addition, when I read the care instructions, it said to dry clean. Dry clean pajamas? No way in the world am I going to do that! I definitely do not recommend this product."
2.0,and wonky. The lines won’t line up based on thrifty sewing
2.0,Nice looking in person but the nose pieces were broken off in the bag... worthless now because they dont stay on... Sux because I got 2 pair and orange pair I got are perfect!
2.0,The silver imediately started coming off. And the other ones gave me some kind of skin reaction
2.0,"Too large for petites. I'm 5'1"" and 110 lbs. Although the length is about an inch too long, it's bearable. However, the shoulder seams fall more than an inch away from my actual shoulders, making me look wide. The style and material are both good, but the nice leaf green pictured online is really more of a dull gray-green."
2.0,"I guess you get what you pay for. Material quality is not bad, soft with a bit of stretch. I got the large, the sleeves are too long and it seems a bit snug. The should are looser and the straps keep getting twisted. Wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,"The Big Guy has a big head. These glasses did not fit. While they were a little wider than usual, the side stems did not reach back far enough. We got a different pair for about $25 on Amazon that are truly XL and fit him beautifully. I strongly recommend you measure the frames that currently fit and compare it to the measurements listed here. These are not the ones you want."
2.0,One of the lenses loosened and partially fell out I tried to fix it but the screw was already stripped right out of the box making it impossible to resecure it back in place I'm disappointed that I didn't keep the box just to return them if it's possible
2.0,"This thing is made poorly.  Cartoon dog face attached to a head piece.  Costume itself is very thin,  see thru and two sizes too small. My 9 year old got largest size available and it is way too"
2.0,"The red and green is not vibrant like the photo. It's very hard to see. The dress does fit well, true to size."
2.0,"It should be mentioned in the description that you can't wear two of these, one on each ear, because it is made only for a right ear and I needed a left ear.<br />Unfortunately, they will probably go back. I purchased two, like normal earrings and it is not that at all.  The earring is very pretty and fits on the right ear.  It is, however, quite heavy. but....I wanted two and if I was only going to wear one, I would need the other ear. Soo, for me, I was very disappointed."
2.0,"Returned to sender and irregular , two sizes smaller."
2.0,Too tight on the stomach
2.0,no se presta en la reseña para ver el grueso y no es lo que queríamos
2.0,The color was really off.
2.0,The fan us too small so it only partially inflates
2.0,Latger then I thought. But may keep it
2.0,"Cute, but mine came without backs at all. Just the bare posts."
2.0,"I usually wear a 32D and I ordered a 34D and it is way too tight around even on the last clip, and the cup size on my breasts fits nice but won't fit once my milk is in. It'll be too small. The stretchy material is very hard and not very stretchy at all. The only good part is the cute lace, but that doesn't really help with the bra doesn't fit."
2.0,It’s very CHEAPLY MADE!! It’s not cotton material. Just didn’t like it at all.
2.0,"The shirt runs short, definitely not as long as it is in the picture. Also a very thick material."
2.0,Novelty straw hat. Should be priced lower to reflect the quality. Hat had an oriental trading tag. The raised portions that should have made this look like a pith helmet were barely visible. It basically looked like a dorky straw hat with a short brim. I ended up highlighting the lines with a charcoal pencil to make &#34;shadows.&#34; It still looks cheap.
2.0,"Personally for me my nipples are too big and you can't get them in. I have pretty decent sized breasts, this is for people with smaller nipples that naturally 'poke' out, not for those of us whos nipples are inverted until you get them hard. or with big nipples."
2.0,This is meant for a child. I'm a thin adult and had to return it due to it being so ridiculously small.
2.0,"I'm only 5' 5"" tall and these boot cut pants are ridiculously short. Like seriously cropped pants. Not a good look."
2.0,"I was very excited about this swimsuit but very disappointed when I received it.  Based on the reviews, I ordered three sizes up. I usually wear a M or L bottom, but decided to go with the XXL.  The bottom fit fine, but the top was entirely too small. I didn't think it was worth the price to keep the entire suit, so I ended up returning it.  The XXL top was made for someone with a B cup and I have a D."
2.0,I t was to small
2.0,"They were good while they lasted, I’ve only had them a month and there is already a hole in them. I’ve only worn them about 4 times and only around the house."
2.0,It was a little small on the top around my chest
2.0,"There was a small hole along the seam right in the middle of the front. Other than that, this was really cute. Fit like the picture shows, but was a pretty blue color, not mint like the picture."
2.0,"It is a very cute dress. The material is great! It's soft and sturdy. Could be dressed up or down. Just big. I am 5'4 120 lbs and the smell was very saggy on me. Whenever you tie it, the fabric bunches up and it's not very flattering. Probably going to keep it for a winter wear outfit!"
2.0,Not as advertised! I am not happy with it. The product does not portray Michael Kors' attributes.
2.0,"This coat is really cute and nice and warm.  Warm enough for winter in Wisconsin.  Unfortunately, the zipper broke after it's first use so returning and will likely not be replacing."
2.0,Quality is poor and bad. The pic is better than reality.
2.0,"Shoulders fit fine, but the sweater is waaaaaay too short"
2.0,"The thigh is tight. The waist is good, bit to tight on the legs"
2.0,Did not fit As expected
2.0,Hat had a gray substance on the top of the hat.
2.0,Inside lining is like rice paper.  Returned
2.0,It looks like the picture I guess but it does not have the tail on it like the picture shows
2.0,Bought an xl and they are way too small<br />All my yoga pants by other brands are xl and they fit great. These pants don’t even make it past my thighs. I have them to my friend’s teenage daughter that’s 135lbs
2.0,"This is a lightweight, moisture wicking T shirt that happens to have a collar.  Not at all what I was expecting, but it makes a decent base layer.  It wrinkles easily."
2.0,It’s not the color I thought it wd be. I ordered navy but it’s more of a teal green?  Unfortunately it’s too loose so slips off. 😖
2.0,Cute style. Fabric cheap looking and thin.
2.0,"This is really small hoop, 18g 7mm and the pics are really deceiving.  We first looked at this had raving review which are probably fake because now as of Dec 28 it has 2 stars. You can’t even seen the crystal stones within the ring. The only good thing is that it firmly snaps into itself but other than that jot worth $17."
2.0,Faster shipping was surprised.  But ring definitely not like pictures.  Fit great but ring was bent and dented. Good for cheapo ring as decoration like disposable ring is thes best I can describe.  Wasn't impressed. Not luxury looking fashion. Even fake unfortunately.
2.0,"Were super cute and decent price, however, they broke the first time they were worn."
2.0,Good looking apparel but the size chart does not accurately translate sizes for  American consumers.  Even the XXL fits like a typical US medium adult.
2.0,"I am not a small women .5""2 and 200 pounds evenly built . I wanted to like this but its not made for my shape at all. the material is like basket ball shorts material . I do wear it around the house but would not step outside in it."
2.0,Cute shoes. Love the look when in I first got them. However the more you wear them the more they stretch out. Material of poor quality. Probably will have to throw them away after this season due to so loose on my feet now after stretching
2.0,Dress was very short. Also is not a full skirt as shown in pictures. It’s it strips of tool looped in a knot sparsely placed all the way around. A child would definitely need to wear shorts or pants under it to not show any under garments. Satin neck straps are thin straps of statin ribbon with course edges that irritate children’s skin. My niece didn’t like it at all bc it was itchy. If you are looking for a play dress that you aren’t concerned with how long it lasts or functions then I would say this would be it. But for the cost compared to quality it was not worth it to me. I have ordered other princess dresses for same price and gotten MUCH better quality and fit.
2.0,The color was not like the picture at all
2.0,"I read a lot of reviews saying these are similar to Lulus. They are NOT. The material is heavy and much less elastic/stretchy. The worst part is the elastic that runs along the top edge of the wait band. It squeezes right where that elastic is (even though the rest of the pants are not tight). Lulus smooooooth along the waistband, with no actual elastic piece. More like compression fit."
2.0,"Received size Large. Ordered: LUXEHOME Women's Cozy Fleece Plush House Slipper (6.5-7.5 US, Blue)"
2.0,Fits really big!
2.0,turned too quickly ...but pretty while it lasted
2.0,"Poor quality ,cheap product ,it waste my money I got it for $ 25.48 with shipping .totally different from the picture.<br />you should sale this for $5"
2.0,Not very study. Did not use for Disney vacation.
2.0,The legs and pocket/material are great but tummy area is really large. Ordered a size smaller and same problem. Zero tummy control. I am one of those girls who has a pooch on a slim frame and the lower tummy area of these pants could be a lot tighter. Lots of looseness in the sew pattern. Unfortunately even in a smaller size.
2.0,Very cute fits nice but missing 3 buttons. Probably gonna return
2.0,"Extra flimsy, almost sheer. Not worth the money. Disappointed."
2.0,"Color is nice - length is a little long - issue is the waist - it REALLY  needs to be made of fabric that stretches more - once I am wearing it it fits fine , but pulling it over my hips is a struggle- if the waist fabric stretched more this wouldn’t be an issue"
2.0,I wish it had fleece
2.0,Everything would've been perfect but there was a hole in the inner shipping bag and one of the cufflinks fell out. I will have to order another.
2.0,Pretty ring but it didn’t have the 925 mark inside the ring
2.0,"Wear a medium, but large and extra large were both too small. I would say the large would be about a size 4 and the XL is maybe a 6"
2.0,Hard to get earring back through. Not good
2.0,I returned this item. The posts are super long and seemed like they would be uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,My daughter needed a strapless backless bra for my older daughters wedding. This was a great idea but didn't  fit well. She wears a 34DDD and we ordered accordingly. But it doesn't even cover her nipples. And the cups are way off to the side even when tied up all the way. She did say it sticks well but she's to uncomfortable having it not actually covering her. So if you're not comfortable with feeling braless under clothes don't choose this one. When you're her size you are very used to wearing a full figure bra. This is less than even a demi
2.0,I ordered an extra large and it still didn't fit right. I gave it to my aunt who is a small and it fit her perfectly. I don't know who makes the sizes for this but I'm sorry I'm not a little girl.
2.0,"Not true to size.... smaller than both in girth and cup size.  Sturdily made, good quality ...lacks in fit if your ""fuller"""
2.0,Ripped from sole in one month
2.0,I loved the dress. When I tried it on the first time it was exactly what I wanted. It just had a strong chemical like smell so I washed it just as the tags specified. Unfortunately the dress is ruined. I recommend dry cleaning. Also it runs a size small so order a size up.
2.0,Too small. I have ordered nothing but ViV in the past due to their wonderful quality and great designs. I also have a pair of plain grey ones. However for some reason these did not fit the same and were small and too tight. I normally order the Regular one size fits all and I am 5'7&#34; and packing some baby belly fat. I will return for a plus size one size fits all instead I guess. All other designs and colors have fit just fine with room to spare.
2.0,"Arrived quickly, however this bag has a few issues. First, the lining between the pockets seems to have bubble wrap or some other plastic inserted between the layers of nylon fabric. I assume this is for cushioning, but it makes a crinkling noise when you open the purse. Also, the zippers unfortunately seem to be defective and the metal hardware was scratched although the product was described as new. Maybe I received a defective bag, but I would not purchase this again."
2.0,After trying on fit was baggy in the stomach region…but the worst part is it caused me to be so itchy…my skin felt tingly and so itchy.
2.0,These are HUGE and very loose on the face
2.0,"It was too large and it was plainly visible that it is a one piece dress, in a tacky way. Didn’t like it at all."
2.0,I'm giving this 2 stars becuz these things kill yr ears if worn longer than 30 mins sometimes less I tried pushing back the product nothing makes it better  waste of my money really if I didn't have to go through a hassle I would have returned them
2.0,Look really old
2.0,"These are super cute, but do not stay on babys feet :( I was hoping with the robeeze brand (which we have bought other products before) that these would work..wasted my money on these :("
2.0,The mask is good quality but only one size and it’s really big
2.0,"I bought two of these for my daughters to match - they are not the same sweater. They're similar, but definitely different. They're also a bit too big and kind of shapeless. They'll get the job done since it seems too much of a hassle to send them back, but not the quality I had hoped for."
2.0,"Cheap.. but given the price that's to be expected. If you're looking for a throw away, not bad."
2.0,It is to light with no body. It is paper-thin with no support.
2.0,Disappointed because I thought they were earrings and they aren't.
2.0,The zipper broke and the stitching on the side of the bag started to rip after the first use so I can no longer use it.
2.0,These shoes look like other nice end hiking shoes made from other name brands and that is probably the single best aspect of them.  These shoes look nice on your feet for sure.  They fit as expected basically and they are fine for basic walking and light hiking.<br /><br />These shoes seem pretty cheap.  The padding all around is quite thin and the seams don't seem very strong.  The tread is fine but these shoes will loose their shape after a while I suspect. They would probably puncture quite easily and I would not really recommend these overall.
2.0,"For the price, the quality is terrible. The picture fades after one wash!"
2.0,I was a bit disappointed when these flats arrived.  They look and feel like plastic.  I was expecting a better quality product.
2.0,Fabric was not the quality I expected.
2.0,"These are much heavier than bigger hoops I have… they are cute but when I wear them all day, they start to hurt, which isn’t the case with other hollow thick hoops I have"
2.0,"This shirt looks so beautiful and comfy in the picture. I ordered my normal size, and omg I was lucky to get itnoff without ripping it! If Id order again Id probably go 2 sizes up just to make sure. I do love how the sleeves have a strap and button to create a cute new 3/4 sleeve tho."
2.0,Cute.. goes a little high
2.0,"Deberia venir en tallas, es muy pequeño."
2.0,"I work in a warehouse and I have already a silicone screen protector for my 7 Apple Watch, I see many direct scratches and this band won’t do any justice for direct scratches. While playing with my kids tag and hide and see, at the park my watch already has been banged and a rock has scratched  the silicon protector TG my watch was saved, but this Band I will be returning. Super cute just NO cover all around for the face of the watch to get a direct pebble scratch. Maybe a feeble 98 yr old who doesn’t have to be active will like this band , maybe donate it to the goodwill make a happy heart happy 😃"
2.0,Bag is super cute! Although it fell apart after only a week of light use. The clasp on the front fell off. And strap also breaks a lot.
2.0,Not what I expected but nice all the same.  It is definitely not for a 3x person. Does not fit the bust well and is rather short. Easy to wear.
2.0,Not impressed. It loses time daily. Waiting for it to stop running completely
2.0,Center stone was missing once box opened
2.0,The size guidelines posted does not accurately reflect the actual size.
2.0,"Rolled up on the legs and no tummy support, where they also rolled down at the waist. Control top pantyhose support and fit, (remember those?!) was more along my expectations. No where close! Waste of money."
2.0,"I bought one of these for my sister who was dying horribly, and in excruciating pain.  And, no, I wasn't being ironic in the sense that the cancer was clearly winning and the pendant talks about &#34;not failing&#34; (which she obviously was...you know, dying and all).  Well at the very least I thought that if she were wearing this when she met St. Peter, it might buy her a little influence getting in.  It didn't work.  She still went to Hell.  For the record, my sister was an awful human being UNTIL she got cancer, so maybe that had something to do with it."
2.0,"While for this price I wasn't looking for handmade quality, skip this product. The white version was really cheap, cut uneven, and the tassels/trim was unevenly stitched. The material itself wasn't completely sheer - which was nice, and makes me wish the rest of the product wasn't such a mess/uneven so I could actually use it. Returned."
2.0,"Visually, these are pretty decent for the price. The box and shoes look very similar to Mini Melissa shoes. Each shoe came with its own dust bag. But the shoes STINK. They smell like cheap tires and stink up the whole room they’re in. They also made my baby’s skin red, she only wore them for an hour or two. I won’t make this mistake again."
2.0,This dress is extremely see-through. Must wear a slip underneath!
2.0,Looks better in picture. Cheap looking in person. Wish I didn't buy it. Instructions are very lacking. Not sure I'll ever figure out how to use it.
2.0,The padding on the inside is not sufficient enough. Also the part that rests on the nose feels like a needle poking
2.0,Doesn't stay on as well as I would like.
2.0,Arrived with gem broken off. Heavy.
2.0,"the zipper broke in less than a month, going to order another one in different color and hope it doesn't happen again.  I really like the wristlet and would have given it 5 stars if not for the zipper problem.  I do not over fill the wristlet so that didn't contribute to the zipper breakage.  I ordered the coral and is a great color, as shown."
2.0,It didn't feel like a massage. It hurt my feet bottoms to wear them. Not for me.
2.0,This item has a strong chemical smell.  Looks ok but cheaply made.  Would not buy again.
2.0,"I ordered 2 pairs of these for my boys and ordered according to the sizing chart measuring their feet and everything. They are HUGE! I feel like even if they fit my kids feet sole wise, the strap going around the back ankle would still be huge and flapping around. Would be a good shoe for kiddos with wide feet maybe. My boys wear sizes 7.5-8 and with their measurements from the size chart, the 9 & 10 I ordered should have fit. Maybe I should’ve just ordered by their normal size VS following their size chart."
2.0,"Per most reviews, you need to be smaller chested (A cup? small B?) to fit this dress. I got a M as I'm 5'3, and the length was perfect, but the chest felt like a S. The material is also listed as polyester, and it's definitely cotton and will shrink even more. Stitching and quality is slight better than poor, but far from good. No tag in the dress (poor manufacturing), and overall, this should be a $9.99 find on sale at the local Jeans Warehouse...not $25. My first (and last) attempted purchase of clothes on line. The return process is easy, until you have to go to a UPS store and stand in a long line...ugh. Miss the days of dropping in our mailbox."
2.0,"5’8, 145, 34C, athletic build, normally a M. I ordered up a size based on reviews, and my oh my. No. Even if I would have purchased my usual size, the midsection would probably still bloom out and be way too large. The material is also very, very thin and somewhat see-thru. I’m going to exchange the L for a M and we’ll see, but I don’t have high hopes. I will update my review once this happens."
2.0,Not what I expected. The material is weird.
2.0,Looks cheap in person....wouldn't have gotten it if I saw it first.
2.0,of course the product is great but the price is a rip-off. i found it at kohl's for about 15 bucks cheaper. very disappointed.
2.0,Too small !  Who puts cash on the outside of the wallet?
2.0,The material is great! It looks well made.  I don't like giving it a bad rating but it was just too big. One size doesn't always fit most
2.0,"I wore this bracelet one time, and while sitting at my office desk it brought.....Seemed to be quality but the string was very poor quality....Requested refunded....Bummmed"
2.0,Fabric is ok but straps across chest were around my nexck. Entire dirt seemed unproportioned
2.0,"Had a torn in the hem of the arm, tight around the bust."
2.0,These do not fit the same as the older same style Perry Ellis
2.0,its beautiful in concept.  I know for the price I am not going to get silver but after just 2 wears it has tarnished.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"I love the colors. Love the fit. But tried each of the three and after 3 or so days, the watch band doesn’t stay closed. Pops open all day."
2.0,I like the dress ... but its not for all curvy women.  If you like clothes hugging you in all the places (right and wrong) well get this dress.  I prefer my clothes not to hug so much I ordered up I am a 3x but I ordered a 4x.  Ordering up a size really didn't matter. I like the pattern its as pictured but I will have to snatch my waists for me to like this dress - and I really don't want too
2.0,"Don't know what I did wrong but when I washed these, they came out covered in stains. Not sure if it was the fabric or my doing. Disappointed because the pants were a great color (I picked the berry color), fit and style."
2.0,UPDATE...stiching in front at the V neck is starting to unravel after only 2 washes.<br /><br />Fits so well and the design is great. Pockets perferct size fir a large cell phone and placed well on the dress.  I am reserving 5 stars for after the 1 1st wash to see how it holds up.
2.0,The straps across the collar bone were so loose it looked weird and then it was tight everywhere else.
2.0,"At first I really liked these sunglasses, but I have only had them a week and the color is already peeling off. Very frustrating."
2.0,Not secure in the ear
2.0,I bought a XXL size because the others reviews but is far away too super too small. XXL = size 12 for kids. My daughter is using this tshirt.
2.0,"Just the slightest tug on the buckle causes the belt itself to slip through the buckle and loosen, no longer performing its job of holding pants or shorts up. It slips several times throughout the day and I need to constantly re-tighten it. This is very annoying. It is definitely threaded according to the pictures.<br /><br />In addition, the buckle is bulky and will not fit through some belt loops. The buckle barely fits through the belt loops on a pair of Levi's, for example, and only with some difficulty. Don't use this belt if you are in a hurry.<br /><br />The quick release works as expected.<br /><br />When joined, the two halves of the buckle have a 2.5mm - 3mm gap, which looks like a quality defect.<br /><br />It does not seem like this product was tested in real life situations."
2.0,The color is not as expected AT ALL. Will definitely be returning
2.0,lied color but not quality
2.0,"The threads are extremely poor quality,  It’s made of multicolored thread and bits are pulling out, all over the place. It looks ok from afar but up close it’s terrible. If your looking to spend $70 on cheap piece of material then it’s fine. Judging by the reviews I was expecting it to be better quality."
2.0,"Was super excited to get this. Tried it on and was disappointed. As much as I love this print and want to keep it I just don't think it's gonna work. It's a bit tight, I am spot on in the measurements in the discriptions, but it was tight around my hips. Probably getting the next size up would help. When adjusting the straps it did sit a little better at the top and didn't pull everything down like it did without adjusting. When pulled up it digs into my hips which isn't flattering. Seems as if it's almost too short maybe. Just didn't work for me unfortunately."
2.0,"Totally different color and has matte look instead of shiny. Material is thin and hanging loose at the back. 5'4"" 130lb 33""27""39"""
2.0,This arms to be cut really small because i usually wear between an xl and xxl but i bought a 3xl hoping
2.0,This is subpar quality- and nothing like the expected material.
2.0,It's too long and has a bad smell
2.0,Very nice dress with the exception that I could not get my arms in the sleeves!  They were way too tight.  The fabric was heavier than what I wanted;other than that it was well made and very pretty.  Can't figure out how to return it as no info in the package so will just donate it.  Frustrating because it is a beautiful dress.
2.0,"They look cute, but they smell horrible."
2.0,The fabric is a clinging knit. Too bad as its nicely made.
2.0,It’s cute and soft but it has a hole in it after only one wash. Nothing that can’t be fixed but disappointed.
2.0,Looks way better in picture.Very small and cheap looking. Very surprised when I opened package .Probably would'nt have bought it.
2.0,"When I received the hat, the spinner and top ball were broken off. They must have only been held on by a little glue!"
2.0,I purchased these a couple of years ago and they were perfect. This new design is smaller and everytime you turn over or move the mask moves. So unless you sleep perfectly still these will not work for you.
2.0,Pretty color but kinda small
2.0,"I would really like these sandals but they're too skinny.  I wear btween a 12 and a 13 so usually a size 13 is plenty big enough.  I ordered these in a 13 and they're just too skinny, so my foot looks like it hangs out the side.  If you have really skinny feet and like the Jesus-style sandal then these are what you are looking for.  Not for big men."
2.0,Waited five weeks for and they are much bigger than they appear half the size of your ear
2.0,"I ordered this suit for my daughter according to the sizing posted under description. She is 10yrs old but quite petite so I ordered an XL due to the description stating XL was equivalent to size 8-10. However, I received the suit, it is far too big and the tag inside the suit says XL 14-16. The material is very heavy (Circo brand which I think is Target). The color is vibrant. I would love to reorder but don't trust the sizing."
2.0,"Poor quality, the insole already came out even before wearing them."
2.0,"The frame material has a nice feel to it. They are not the cheap plastic you get in other similarly priced glasses. However, the dealbreaker is the fact that these are not polarized. The only reason I bought these are because they said they were polarized. Do the phone screen test and you will see there is not polarized effect."
2.0,"It's really heavy, kid can not walk easy. And roller doesn't go in easily. It's really hard to push, and right away comes up, with roller super high heel, which is not comfortable at all for kids. I don't recommend this for kids."
2.0,Too many wrinkles!!
2.0,I don't care for the color and the neck is too large
2.0,The drawstring waist didn’t hit me at my waist that totally threw the whole look off.
2.0,I received this late and it came broken. The line of jewels on the forehead was broken
2.0,"I actually question some of the other reviews after having bought the product myself (I will be returning it).<br /><br />First, this will NOT fit a child's head. For an adult (me), there are huge amounts of strange gaps inside the helmet and feels oddly loose. It's not even a remotely snug fit for a large adult size head. While I do understand the need to keep it generic, see my second complaint below.<br /><br />Secondly, there's no way to adjust the chin strap. The photo I uploaded really says it all. If you decide to let the chin strap hang under the chin, instead of over it, it's mildly acceptable as long as the loose fit of the helmet doesn't bother you.<br /><br />Most everything else about the helmet is decent... it looks good and the material's great. But there's a reason why they don't use a model for any of their product photos, because it simply is a bad fit."
2.0,Nice looking but very poor quality and extremely overpriced. Had to return.
2.0,"Why did I buy this? It looks a bit tacky, I could make it at home. Also the beads fall off cause there is nothing to stop them. So I had to find all the pieces and put it back together."
2.0,"As others have written, the shirt is well made out of quality material, but it is no where as long as it appears in the photo and it is SUPER small.  when I first opened it, I thought they had sent a child's shirt by mistake. I ordered the medium following the size chart, and it needs 2 more inches of material to even button across my chest.  I'd return it, but my tiny friend with a small chest can wear it.  Disappointing."
2.0,"Cute, but skinnier and cheaper looking than expected.  Nearly impossible to clasp on your own wrist without help from someone else."
2.0,"This tie is nice quality, but it is NOT EXTRA LONG.  It is about 4 inches short of that description.  Did not serve my purpose"
2.0,The color is an ugly green instead of what I thought
2.0,"longer in arms and body length, and neckline doesn’t lay flat at all but good fit around body... be careful if you have dry or sensitive skin, the material even after washing became irritating after a while of wearing it."
2.0,"I received but ,One of the rhinestones that fell out.So I can't give it know good review."
2.0,The size came waaaay to big. I can dress in either medium or large. So I ordered a large just in case. The leotard looked like it could've been 3 times as big. Seeing as it was too late to return I had to find a replacement Leo. The rest of the outfit was great.
2.0,You can't charge the watch with the band on and have to take it out. The band was also too think.
2.0,"This is not the Dorfman Pacific Safari #863L, which is a better fitting and much nicer hat.  My advice is to be careful and look for #863L, otherwise you may be stuck with paying for return shipping from this seller."
2.0,"This shirt is very thin, almost see through, cheap material. Disappointed that it doesn't look near as nice as the pictures. It also runs a little big...I sized up and shouldn't have."
2.0,"I'm rather dissapointed with this product. It shipped very fast, but the product itself was very small. The hearts are smaller then the clasp! I would not advise people to get this product."
2.0,These are nice earrings but not the same as advertised.
2.0,"The color and length are great, but it's cut way too low in the front.  I wanted to wear it as a dress, not a cover-up."
2.0,Also came with the wrong instruction manual. Mess.
2.0,I bought these for my husband to replace his that broke. These are not solid brass but brass plated.  Still  nice but it's not solid.
2.0,"The color wasn't quite right... more of a pastel.  The fabric wasn't what I was expecting - although probably my fault for not reading close enough.  This felt &#34;satiny&#34; like a nightgown.  And there was just something about the way it hung, I guess I was expecting it to be wider at the bottom and that it would be flowier.  This hung straight down on me and I didn't feel like it was flattering at all. This wasn't sheer though, not see-through at all as others said.  I'm typically an XL and ordered a large due to other reviews, and it fit fine.  But still, I will be returning this."
2.0,It fits well but it is not Fleece. Its cotton. I wanted something warm for baby - disappointed
2.0,"You get what you pay for, I guess. These look nice and my daughter likes them, but the stitching failed on the pants already after one or two wearings. And these are being worn as pajamas for sleeping not as long underwear during the day.  Ithought it was too good to be true, three sets for $20. yup. it is."
2.0,"Very cute and fitting. A little too tight around the ears. Please note, they are Not polarized!"
2.0,Fabric is like a plastic feeling polyester and looks just ok. Wouldn’t buy again
2.0,The dress is nice but runs big.
2.0,The dress is huge and really doesn't have any shape
2.0,Fit was just odd. I have a curvy body and this was just horrible fitting.
2.0,"If you’re wide in the shoulders, or want a shirt made from quality material, do not buy."
2.0,"I've worn it a few times now, and it is not remotely as nice as the Lands End cashmere sweaters I bought last year. Scratchy under my arms where I'm sensitive, and overall not soft. So sad.<br /><br />One thing Lands' End seems to get right is that the crewneck is just the right size, tight enough for warmth but not too tight, even in bigger sizes like I wear."
2.0,The fit is good .But quality  is  very cheap ......One time use only .
2.0,I ordered this sweatshirt for my son as a Christmas gift. He really loved. it He was so sad that it was at least 2 sizes to small and I had ordered a size Medium and he usually wears a medium and sometimes even a small.
2.0,"This dress was really cute, but material was extremely thin, and fits awkwardly. Had to send it back :("
2.0,"I love the size of these earrings and was quite happy with them until the third time I wore them and the post became detached from one of the earrings. While the earrings are lovely, particularly for the price, the weld was very flimsy. Unfortunately, the return period has lapsed so they are no longer eligible for return."
2.0,It was exactly what I was looking for but I wore it twice and it started to turn brown.  If it is gold coated it starts to rub off.
2.0,I am a great fan of Allegra K product. I bought so many Tops but this one disappointed me. Looks great BUT color ran off from the red dots. I will not be able to wear this.
2.0,Size is bigger than shown and did not suit well
2.0,Pictures look 1000x better than the actual watch. Two pins bent when adjusting size?
2.0,"While the face of the watch was great, the band was AWFUL. It literally started peeling and cracking after the second time wearing it without a ton of movement over the weekend. This watch had better reviews than many of the other &#34;wood watches&#34;, but be prepared to buy a different band."
2.0,This is a beautiful dress however it had a very unusual fit
2.0,"Cute toe rings, but they tarnish so fast :-("
2.0,Definitely Not True To Size
2.0,Not even the same shirt I received! The shirt I received has a black zip on the side so it unzips only on one side!
2.0,"The bathing suit was okay. You get what you pay for. I think the lining on the inside was too much and you can see it when I put it on, and wasn’t too flattering. I got a medium because last time I got a small it was TOO small. I feel as if, if I got a small, it would be too small, so I would try and size up maybe. If the lining wasn’t the problem I would return it and try to size down."
2.0,Sized way too small.
2.0,"The band was shorter than I expected & the first time I used it, the band had undone. Glad I didn’t lose my watch."
2.0,"Sizing is spot on, but the description of material of this product is misleading. This is not your typical cotton/ cotton blend sweatsuit material, but more of a velour look and feel. Not sure this is something I want to put on my 3 year old son, even though it is advertised as a product for both boys and girls."
2.0,Severe shrinkage!
2.0,"While the shoes arrived sooner than expected, they are not the exact same shoes as pictured and described. They are too small, not high tops, not the same gripped soles, a different color interior and the have the words &#34;LITTLE baby&#34; printed on each of the velcro straps. I am not going to bother returning them because it is too much of an inconvenience for what I paid for them. I cannot use them and am very dissapointed."
2.0,"Chain is magnetic and caused a rash around my neck. Most likely made of nickel. Love the pendant, but I had to buy a new chain."
2.0,"Very flimsy, thin material. Does not hug curves, drapes over them.... awkward straps"
2.0,"IF this clasp in the front to open the bra is an IQ Test, then I failed. I cannot open the clasp. So I squeezed it over my head. I ordered a 38B. I think I am a 38A, but that size doesn't exist. The fabric smells funny. I will wash it right away. It's too tight, and it's cutting into me and making me tense. The band is too tight, and the cups are too big, but the racerback is great. It also came in like 2 days, and I need it for a dance show, so I will wear it for the minimum time I must and then squeeze out of it as fast as possible. Good Luck, Everyone. If a comfortable bra exists in the world, please tell me about it. Thank you."
2.0,Ripped on the second wear. Just to the store
2.0,The shirt isnt orange like the picture however still a nice shirt
2.0,"First of all, photo isn’t the same shirt. The shirt in the picture is much thinner and form fitting than the actual shirt i received. Second, the actual shirt is not stretchy it’s actually quite thick and warm. Turkish made woven on top cotton i believe, but underneath the garment is polyester looking and thicker than the outside material. Poor and deceiving picture. The actual shirt wears more like a crew sweatshirt than a long sleeve tight and stylish fashion shirt. I will be keeping it because it is unique in my closet and it is a great shirt for those like me who prefer not to wear a shirt underneath(the added material on the inside is quite nice touch) BUT, next time i pay 40$ for a shirt, it better be exactly as advertised!"
2.0,Super cute shorts but the run extremely small.
2.0,This print is ugly it doesn't look like in the photo and the ups left the package in my yard so the do dog ate it
2.0,Fabric is not the best.  Not soft.  The fabric is pretty cold in the winter and I think it will be hot in the summer.
2.0,"This really looked like a costume and less like a club dress. It’s definitely fun, but I ended up giving the dress away. Wouldn’t ever actually wear this out for how cheap it looks. Pass if you’re looking for a night out outfit, buy if you’re going to a themed/costume party."
2.0,It is not the size as on the picture. This watch is for teenagers with small wrist.
2.0,"Cheap metal, the color came off on my neck after the first time wearing it."
2.0,Same model number as a polarized pair from another store but these were definitely not polarized. Returned.
2.0,bought two on accident and both broke..
2.0,Stainless steel is not supposed to tarnish or loose iits color but these have.
2.0,"This just might win an ugly Christmas contest. Two large, too long, but the worst part is the patterns do not match up at all from the front to the back. It just looks silly. I am 5 foot three weigh 160 pounds and bought the extra large."
2.0,Not a true 3xl
2.0,"This bra looks like it would fit just fine, but once I had it on the straps would NOT stay up. It was almost like the straps were set too far apart from each other and that's why they kept sliding down my arms because of this I really ended up hating the bra. Every time I would wear it I would curse those stupid straps for having to pull them back up. Who wants to constantly be adjusting their bra?? Especially at work.<br />As for the rest of the bra, it was great! There was a lot of support, even without an underwire and this would be the perfect bra for a working and nursing mother like I was. I felt comfortable wearing this bra with work clothes and when I got home I could keep it on for nursing my little one. Note: I was not pumping with this bra, I do think it would be a little difficult to use for pumping.<br />Good luck searching for a good nursing bra if you're a working mother. I had the hardest time with this and went through several bras. I truly think everyone is different and you probably just have to try out a few. This bra was horrible for me, but maybe for you and your body type it would work. Good luck momma!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest product review."
2.0,Sent this dress back...I wanted to love it but it was to small ( I even ordered a size up) and it came with one of the sleeves messed up already.
2.0,They don't clasp on well at all so I already lost one
2.0,"This blouse was very disappointing. It was just a plain blue, nothing special. The fabric was nothing special. I sent it back."
2.0,Quality not as expected it seems chip material definitely not like the store quality the even the price tag looks fake I really have doubts if this is an imitation
2.0,These are nice for the lady’s
2.0,These run small compared to the other brands I've tried.
2.0,"The glasses blocked sun as expected and bifocal was well placed. However, the ear piece arms attach to front of the lens. With just normal wear, they began to detach. They do not use a screwdriver fitting making it difficult and time consuming to repair."
2.0,Color is not quite as pictured. Fits a little tighter than expected.
2.0,"The material is stiff and weird, not flowing at all."
2.0,They were to short. Not what I expected at all.
2.0,Waist was fat too large and legs weee very short
2.0,You get what you pay for I guess/ It feel apart after wearing it twice and I didn't even wear it for that long!
2.0,Broke after about 7-8 months of use...
2.0,It's hard for me to even give this product stars given upon receipt It was so tiny all I did was put it back in the package and return it.<br />This product is advertised to fit up to a 40D. There is no possible way!!! I don't even think it fits a 36C.
2.0,Returned it . Too big .
2.0,looks good but broke already
2.0,"These run small in my opinion and I even went up a size.  So tight, I had a fight to get one on.  Returned."
2.0,"I ordered the black striped in L, the tag says 95% Cotton 5% Spandex. I can say that the material is really nice and flowy/stretchy, somewhat like modal pajamas and is ever so slightly wider at the bottom. I would easily give it 10 stars BUT the stitching had several loose spots and bunched threads and a small V hole in the sleeve that looks like a scissor cut. I contacted the seller and after 2 weeks and several email exchanges, there were no more black L in stock, they sent a replacement in grey Large. The fabric is NOT the same, the grey is 5% Spandex 95% Rayon, and 4inches smaller. It doesn't have the same flow or stretch, not an unacceptable fabric, just not the same fabric but the stitching was much better on the grey one. So there you have it."
2.0,About 2 sizes too small.
2.0,"Warm comfortable, was a little bit large for my head. Measure your head before purchase.<br />About 2 years of nominal use and stitching is separated causing a nice hole."
2.0,I bought these for my daughter but the stitching came off after a week in both the leggings.
2.0,Looks nice at first but within a month diamonds started to fall off and continue to fall over.
2.0,"I bought this for a trip to Europe—to maximize space in my carry-on. It really was great for organizing my stuff and keeping it from getting too wrinkled. Unfortunately, about half-way through my trip, I removed it from my suitcase and found that one of the two straps broke. I safety-pinned it in place thinking I'd sew it back on when I got home, but the then the other strap broke shortly thereafter. By the time I reached by 2nd to last destination, the top zipper pouch had torn as well. I literally threw this in the trash in Paris."
2.0,"While the shoulder and hip width were the correct size, the length was WAASYYYY to short. I am petite and have a short body, but this was ridiculous. I had the mega wedgie from hell! Do not buy from this seller. I bought two others from other sellers, and they fit fine all around."
2.0,"It looks a lot better here than it does when it arrives. It's very reasonably priced, but what arrived seemed cheaper than what you see in the photo."
2.0,"These goggles are pretty well made and solid, and they are attractive.  The clasping mechanism is the only weakness, but a pretty important one.  The clasping mechanism on these is a circular tab that is punched out about 85% of the way around a wider circle, which then fits into another receiving circle to clasp the straps together behind the head.  The tab is very weak.  It often needs adjusted to fit into the receiving circle and is so weak that it's only a matter of time before it snaps off.  Think of a tab on a can of pop that you can wiggle loose and it snaps after a while.  One of our three pair lasted less than one day at the pool, the other two had to be replaced after about a half dozen trips to the pool."
2.0,"missing one black teardrop stone, I am attempting to repair it myself"
2.0,Fit way to big. Even if it were the right size it is super plain and matronly. Wish I would have returned when I had the chance.
2.0,"The fit is really flattering, material is 100% cotton. It is advertised as a ""thick"" material, however the material is quite thin, it is almost like a T-shirt with a hood."
2.0,Looks like a shopping bag..but hopefully will keep warm
2.0,This item has an odd bunching in the cup area that I can’t get to flatten out.  Not loving this.
2.0,"Very pretty, but 2 sizes too small."
2.0,I had to return this dress - i bought it wo wear to my office function and this dress's fabric is poorly made. I ended up buying another dress which i like very much.
2.0,"Ordered the darker grey color in my picture first and loved them so I decided to order a second pair. The cream colored ones are the exact same size and SO MUCH smaller. The waist is a tiny bit smaller, but the crotch is about 3 inches difference and the length about 8 inches! Trying to exchange them to see if they're defective. I am so disappointed! Edit to add:: the second cream color pair came in and they're just as much smaller. Also tried to order the dark grey and they're the same as the cream. Returning all. So annoyed."
2.0,The fit is true to size but the material is VERY thin and COMPLETELY see thru even in black. Very disappointed.
2.0,"I ordered a 6T but when I got it, it's more like a 4T."
2.0,I ordered two sizes up and it was still incredibly too small. I'm really disappointed.
2.0,Broke after 3-days. Disappointing because it looked nice.
2.0,Looked better online.  Cheap looking junk suitable for young girls
2.0,"Too small, but great quality. Order a size up. Had to return this one."
2.0,"Fabric is a bit stiff, but it does look nice. However it does run small! I ordered XL after reading other reviews. I normally wear size L and this was so tight, not just across the bust, but also the arms. I had to return it."
2.0,"hugs the crotch in a weird way, even if you get a size bigger than you should. at least they're not see through though"
2.0,"Ehhhhh, not as pretty in person, gem is plastic and cheap."
2.0,This cuff is sized for a young child. It would not fit an adult.
2.0,cute but quality is meh
2.0,The material looks soft and the fit looks great but the one I initially ordered had A LOT of makeup stains on the neck and pieces of leaves on it.. ordered another one a size up (they run on the smaller side)
2.0,Too many repeats..Easily broken
2.0,I ended up returning this item as the sleeves made my arms look fatter than they already are. This shirt is just not my style. Also the straps on the shoulder look thick enough to hide a bra strap- they're not.
2.0,"I wear size large, I even looked at the chart before I bought it. I thought I must have been mistaken that it was &#34;boy's&#34; size large, but no... Way too small. the tag even said &#34;large&#34;. Sent it back."
2.0,Took me like 20 mins to figure out how to put the chain together. Would’ve helped if the chain was put together and held together but in came in a little bag
2.0,Cheap. Broke quick.
2.0,"It's nice, but much to small for an adults.  Some one who is 5'4""/125-130lbs, too small. It seems to be  kids size. Would be great in a large size."
2.0,"Kind of hard and stiff. Not very comfortable. But, then, I haven't worn flip-flops since grade school. Made in China. Probably would not have bought them, if I knew that going in."
2.0,This is really cute and i was excited to get it but its too small. Its basically for reed thin women with no curves at all. Im not large chested and i was falling out of the top. Loved the way it looks but wish it was a little bigger as they are not kidding when they say SMALL.
2.0,"I love the color, it’s beautiful! The top has a button that can provide more coverage for the “ladies” but it shows horribly which is annoying. The dress was supposed to come down to my knees, it does NOT, it is very short. (I’m 5’3 so I can only imagine how it would look on someone with a long torso/long legs) the material is also a very thin cotton type so it’s almost see through, the “scrunch” that it is supposed to have is not there in the stomach area, it’s only across the bust, which is a little upsetting. I’m disappointed but I look hot so I can’t really complain that much."
2.0,It is a very good jacket. Make sure to get a size bigger than your usual size.
2.0,The 2 buttons on the side came loose some how
2.0,"Its a nice bag for the price, but it is not a laptop bag, it is more like a catch all bag. It dose not have a way of securing your laptop."
2.0,"The shirt fits fine and looked ok at first but after one wash the bow fell off! I couldn't believe how cheaply made it was.  Of course, it had a really reasonable price but I have bought other clothing items from Allegra K also with good prices that have held up wonderfully.  So I guess it's just sort of hit or miss and I had high expectations.  All in all I would say that I will likely order from Allegra K again but I was really disappointed in this shirt and I don't suggest getting this one."
2.0,Very thin material.  Not what I expected.  Cheaply made.
2.0,"I purchased these to complete my daughter’s Minnie Mouse costume. They were perfect. They aren’t very well made, though, and the bow fell apart by the end of the night."
2.0,"This product had great potential, but it was ruined because the slots for the credit cards are too narrow!  It becomes a real struggle to insert the credit cards.  I sometimes have to bend the cards to get them to fit in ... not good."
2.0,"Fit fine but way too short.  I'm 5'9"" but this hit me mid shin."
2.0,ehh. save your money. I ordered a small and it goes too high up in the front and was very long. and you cant wear underwear with it. now its sitting in my closet and il never wear it. I am 5'2 120lbs
2.0,"This band is ok. It is only one band, so it needs to loop through both ends of watch and then tie it on. I have one with two bands and it’s much easier to put on and keep intact once you take it off."
2.0,"This is definitely not a loose fitting sweater.  I am normally a size medium, it fits just a tad loose. Seems are coming apart."
2.0,Expensive for just one.
2.0,Did not fit properly and the leggings are made of very thin materials.
2.0,"Size was small, even with using their chart. The fabric was kind of cheap and could see through it some. Returned the next day"
2.0,"The bracelets are very cute, haven't rusted even though my son never takes it off even in the shower, but the small link that holds the magnetic half heart onto the bracelet is always coming loose."
2.0,I got stuck. No I’m not kidding my husband had to help me out. I’m a busty girl & broad. But this is definitely not plus size in any way.
2.0,These were cute neck gaiters but were so small. Returned
2.0,"Be careful; these are designed for Asian men and do not conform to typical American sizes. Buy the size bigger, especially for your junk."
2.0,I bought the top for my daughter who wears size 14.I bought extra large. I had to give it to daughter in law who is a size 5 and it was too tight.
2.0,Not true to size. Way too small
2.0,Color of jewles came off on my neck! Otherwise fine.
2.0,"Size: 18-18.5Neck34/35Sleeve (2XL).  I am 6'2 225 lbs.  Everything fit right, but sleeves too short.  I always buy 34/35 sleeves and they fit.  These sleeves are about 2 inches to short for me.  I read other reviews about the sleeves being shorter but gambled."
2.0,This is NOT adult sized
2.0,Top too big and waist band too tight
2.0,Material was too thin (cheap) and did not stretch! It was not sweatshirt material. Sleeves were too short. If I sized up it would have been too wide. Colors were vibrant. I returned the item due to the material and awkward fit.
2.0,i wish they were bigger
2.0,The top was overly large for me- too long waisted
2.0,"The necklaces were cute, but not as long as expected. I also attempted to wear one of the necklace and it just fell off. After looking at it the chain just broke didn't make it even an hour."
2.0,"Ill be returning the medium and ordering the large. I ordered based off multiple reviews (I'm 5'3 and 140lbs), but the waist was suffocating, despite fitting well in the butt and things. Fingers crossed I get the breathing room I need without swimming in the rest of the pants.<br />Otherwise, well made. And the cuffs at the ankles added a nice detail."
2.0,Analog hands loose time after awhile.
2.0,Once I opened it looked really cheap so I returned it.
2.0,"I liked them a lot for the two weeks they lasted.  One broke when I was putting it on and the other snagged lightly on my car door and disintegrated.  In both cases there was not enough force to justify them breaking.  I tried to repair them, but I was unable to."
2.0,"I wasn't sold on this product from the photos, but decided to try it out. First of all, the fabric is definitely a sweater, not a shirt; it's bulky and puffy like a sweatshirt, with a softer inside, but not the fuzzy fleece you find in a lot of hoodies. It doesn't drape at all and contributed to the overlarge feel. Second, the print on the chest; while it was accurate, it was stiff and distorted the chest of the garment, making the whole thing fit even worse than the fabric already did. Lastly, the collar was just weird and uncomfortable. It secured by having buttons on both sides, front and back of the sweater which were attached with the buttonholes on the collar, with both front ends securing to the slightly bulkier button on the front above the chest. This allowed the collar (which was stiff enough to cause wrinkles but not soft enough to follow the rounded curve of the shirt or stiff enough to look smart) to be detachable, but for me, having buttons touching every single side of my neck and the biggest one in the front was very uncomfortable. It's probably warm enough for fall, but too uncomfortable for me with the weird collar and slightly scratchy material. It would drape and look a lot better as a shirt with a thinner, softer material."
2.0,Definitely not what you see in the picture. It is a super thin jersey and the number 7 is not even in the corner of the shirt in the front it’s in the center. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I expected a more substantial dress with better material, fit and style. The only thing I liked about it was the blue color which is very pretty.  It's quite tight and very unforgiving.  This really is just a long tee shirt.  I should have known better bc of the ultra low price. fortunately Amazon makes returns so quick and easy.  If you are very slender, not too curvy, and want an elongated t-shirt dress for very casual wear, you'll like this."
2.0,"Cute flannel but runs way too small. I ordered the 2x which I thought would be a little big but fine (I'm about size 14, 38D). What arrived is a (Chinese) 6x and too tight. Even tight on my forearms which are not an unusual size. I can wear it with one button done over my stomach and a T underneath but my chest doesn't really fit. Going to try with a smooshy sports bra."
2.0,"Did exactly what the instructions said, but didn’t make my yeezys waterproof. Accidentally spilt beer on them and it just soaked right in."
2.0,Definitely a thinner material made to be an under shirt. Very stretchy and runs on the slim side
2.0,When you try to open the umbrella it gets stuck and the locking mecanism doesnt work. It goes thru! Do not recommend it
2.0,Looks fine. Constructed well. But you can't use it for schenangens because it stinks and you damn near suffacate because of the smell.
2.0,Doesn't  look like picture or fit  plus  it took  to long to come
2.0,"While this shirt shows fusion, it doesn’t deliver. The image is grainy and out of focus. It looks awesome from 10 feet away but up close it just looks awful. The sizes run about a half size smaller than US sizing.<br /><br />10/10 will transmute this into a rag if Amazon won’t let me return it."
2.0,"Pouch to big and not good support and waistband to small - and I'm a size small, fabric is nice."
2.0,"Beautiful. However, i had a negative skin reaction to the cheap wood"
2.0,"First there is only one shoe stretcher included so that means you can only stretch one shoe at a time. Second, this product is too large for women's shoes. I could not get it to fit in any shoe I wanted to stretch. I am returning this product and suggest if you are a woman you do not purchase this product."
2.0,"If it was in a store, I wouldn't have even looked at it because it is clearly not my style. The fabric is thin, and the pattern on the fabric is very &#34;Little House on the Prairie.&#34;"
2.0,"There is a error in number sequence.  It shows 21,20, 23 and 24. Where is the number 22 ?<br />I don’t want to wear a watch with this type of error. Also the wrist bands is inflexible and uncomfortable.  I’m returning this item now."
2.0,Second day my magnet fell out. So i superglued it back in. But now my charm is starting to tarnish. Had it on about 2 weeks now. Cute bracelets but fall apart quickly.
2.0,Great color and pattern but ties are noticeably wide and out of date.  Need to return.
2.0,Well I wanted to like these but they are not great.  They’d be a lot better if you could loop the key through the ring.  My keys slide out and I had to tape the beaded ring because that kept unlocking.  I am very happy I have managed to catch their falls the times it happened.
2.0,Too big! Ordered a medium and it fits like some extra larges. Size way down!
2.0,Arms were too short. Returned it.
2.0,Does not fit the neck...flops done. Poorly made. Not recommended! I tossed it
2.0,It fits small so I'd size up. Husband is happy with it. I think it's kinda ugly in person.
2.0,These bands look great but a almost IMPOSSIBLE to change. Overall I would not recommend this brand.
2.0,it's okay just not really worth the $22!  I missed return window or I would've sent back.
2.0,"Odd hemline, as it isn't high in front and low in back as pictured.  Is actually all over the place.  I rehemmed it myself."
2.0,"Too big not clingy and not flattering, completely see through"
2.0,"Good quality elastic bands; however, only received six pieces vs the 7 advertised."
2.0,Top waaay small!
2.0,"Picture looked like navy,  received was more of a heather royal blue."
2.0,"Very hard to breath with this mask, color is cool just like the picture"
2.0,"I will say that there were good intentions with the design, covering the nose pads you already have. As someone has already mentioned, they are so large and I feel that everyone would just be staring at my nose pads when anyone tries to talk to me LOL. Sucks I couldn't return them. Oh well!"
2.0,The shoes were cute and only one shoe lit up so my daughter was very disappointed because it let up just for a short while I would like another pair that works doesn’t matter if they are different color thank you
2.0,When i received the shirt and tried it on it was smaller than i expected which made it fit weird on my body. It was too short and that's rare because I am pretty petite so I didn't like it and ended up returning it.
2.0,"I love the look and feel of top, only it runs really small. I ordered both the punk and blue because I really liked the tops and by the reviews the size I picked was going to fit. Well they fit but they are snug. I am bed about how these tops fit."
2.0,Unbearable to wear. Returned.
2.0,They look nice and are comfortable but within 2 weeks my son had holes in the heels of the socks.  Definitely not pleased with this and wouldn't buy again.
2.0,I Will Give An E For Effort. Feels More Of A Child's Necklace And Very Very Small Almost Like A Choker. It Doesn't Come In Different Lengths Also So It's Just That Small Size. Would Have Been Perfect For My Daughter But Not For Me. Also Feels As Though It Might Turn Colors Fast So I Returned Item.
2.0,"I purchased 4 pairs of these in ‘two’ different sizes.<br /> At first they seem ok, But once they were worn I could definitely tell they do not ‘seem’ to be the labeled compression strength. They’re definitely nothing comparable to my old ones. They tend to bunch up and dig into my ankles.  If kept an eye on and pulled back up I get ok results below the ankle. But being I also have neuropathy  I haven’t got much feeling in that area so not a good idea to wear these...<br />And as for the calf area the compression is way too weak. From my ankle all the way up to the knee I received little to no beneficial compression..<br /><br />4 pairs in Two different sizes, and they do fit, just poor quality. I can’t go to a smaller size because they wouldn’t fit.<br /><br />I’ve worn these type of stockings for a few years and have had doctors go over how to use them a few times also so it’s nothing I’m doing wrong.<br />Even most of my 20/30mmHg stockings would give me better results because the compression is graduated correctly. To me, I do not think these are worth the hassle, price or compression."
2.0,"Loved the length of this dress (I’m 5’9” and hit me at the knee), but material was very thin, almost like a nightgown."
2.0,Very pretty but soon as I put it on a broke but he’s good pretty necklace
2.0,Way too small.  Should be advertised as only for women or children.
2.0,I did like the color but these boots are not for small calve women. So if you are looking for a boot for that reason this style is not it. This company has other styles that does fit small calve women. The quality of the boots is excellent but not for me.
2.0,Not the best for an A/B cup
2.0,This hat does not fit well. It is too small for my big head.
2.0,The dress does mot look like it does in the picture the gathers are on the side and not the front was a little disappointed.
2.0,"I love the colors and assortment of designs in each pack, but what I find awkward is that some socks fit my 8.5/9 feet perfectly and some it's damn near a struggle to get them on as if they stitched incorrectly. I don't think that's how a package of socks should work. So far, I only experienced this with the pink set not sure about blue ones. But if the stitching was uniformed to the specifications of the shoe size listed on the package then this will definitely be a 5 star product for the price. I guess &#34;sometimes&#34; you get what you buy according to value."
2.0,"I had it for a couple of months, I really do not have it hanging but at the end it was literally hanging by a thread"
2.0,The pattern is perfect for little girls except the size is way off. They are more like adult socks. They have this huge black heel spot on them which would be mid calf on a little girl. Cute but NOT for girls. More for women
2.0,"This a cute suit if all you are interested in is covering your body.  If you are looking for support, the suit fabric is too loose a stretch and the mesh liner is not strong enough.  think I needed a size smaller, but even so the fabric & the mesh liner do not offer very much support."
2.0,Runs small...if you’re busty or tall don’t waste your $. It’s thin and cheap material as well. Will be returning.
2.0,Fit was tooo small
2.0,It's like wrapping a thin clear tape around your finger. Not comfortable to wear a ring over..
2.0,"Material was slicker and tighter than expected, and squeezed in the wrong places. Runs very small. I have a slim athletic build but they had an overall odd fit and ended up returning them"
2.0,"Cute, but very cheaply made. Wouldn't buy another one."
2.0,The straps bunch up at the shoulders and the light padding only lasts through 1 washing. Pretty good for if you need to sleep in them though- no real support.
2.0,"This clothing article is advertised as a sarong beach cover up but it just kind of creeps me out.  It's too long and I'm tall (5'9"") so I think for anyone less that 5'5"" they will be stepping on it.  It's not a good material for a sarong.  It's made out the same material as window sheers.  I guess it could be used as part of a Halloween costume - maybe a cape or something?  This will never be worn by me and will eventually be hitting the give away bag."
2.0,I cannot read Chinese. I hand washed it and hung to dry. The hoodie sting came off completely. Jeez.
2.0,Bracket broke in the first week.
2.0,"The description says the tie is 3.94 inches wide.  It is less than 3 inches wide, so probably 2.94."
2.0,Nice hat. But very small.
2.0,Not a fan. I mean it did the job was literally the only Cheshire cat tail I could find to add to my home made costume for my church's trunk or treat event. Bit really pricey and kind of... Cheap. You really phoned it in on this one Disney. I honestly expected much more from you.
2.0,Bought these masks because of the extra pocket for putting in additional filters. Worked fine until we washed them twice. One of the straps on a mask fell apart and will have to be sewn back together to make the mask usable again. Second mask appears it will fall apart shortly. Disappointed that they can’t be washed without worrying about them falling apart.<br />4 stars were given for the categories present as they do well in those just not in endurance.<br />Don’t think I can recommend them given our current experience.
2.0,Everything is perfect.. nice style and fit as i expected... but what happen left finishing...
2.0,The magnets are so tiny my little girl can never find them. They also stick to each other so badly.
2.0,"It does not feet like the photo it is loose around the knees so it just looks like a long plastic skirt. It smells loud at first but the part I read about on other reviews and ignored was the sound it makes when you walk. Very cheap sounding and cheap looking. It even feels cheap. But I read that in all the reviews and bought it anyways thinking that people were over exaggerating. Well, they're not."
2.0,Not much of a fabric description or probably wouldn’t have ordered this. Not stretchy at all. A little bit tight. Sending it back.
2.0,Bought 1 used it for about 2 to 3 months then the clasp broke. I thought maybe it was a fluke so I ordered another had it less than a week and accidentally dropped it and the clasp broke.  Sent it back. I wish I could send the other one back too. These are supper cool and the perfect size for me and what I need it for and now I have a different brand that is too big. Such a shame.
2.0,Def way to small. And the print looks like it was suppose to be a small image and they stretched it to fit a shirt. Not so sure it will be given as the gift it was intended. But it is a decent quality shirt. Mabey a sleep shirt??
2.0,"Size runs way to small.  Purchased the XL's, washed and wore them once.  Could see right away they were to small for me, I'm 6'1 220.  Looks kind of like the boy shorts women wear.  See if my brother wants them, he's half my size."
2.0,"The material is like a stretch workout legging with a bit of a sheen and it’s totally see-through. The picture makes it look like a heather gray, but in person it’s a light gray. The fit IS as expected. Medium fit like a medium. But no point getting a light summer dress that needs a slip underneath- returned."
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture. It's super thin and more like a sporty hoodie you would wear to work out than a nice loungey sweater. Not sure if I'll keep it.
2.0,"I BOUGHT THIS SHIRT DURING THE SUMMER, I LIVE IN FLORIDA SO I DIDN'T START WEARING IT UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN SOME COLD WEATHER SET IN, SINCE THEN I PURCHASED TWO SHORT SLEEVE, SAME BRAND SAME SHIRT BUT SHORT SLEEVE, SUPPOSED TO BE SAME MATERIAL, TOTALLY DIFFERENT MATERIAL. THE LONG SLEEVE IS MORE LIKE A SWEATER AND IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO ALSO THIRD TIME WEARING IT REALIZED STITCHING AROUND COLLAR AND SLEEVES ARE COMING LOOSE, WAS VERY EXCITED WITH THIS SHIRT NOW VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED."
2.0,Said fit to size but i ordered a size larger anyway but it was way too tight.
2.0,"For the price, the quality of the material used is really poor. Already piling after first wear."
2.0,Elastic around waist. Short
2.0,"It should be a 7 inches bracelet (as in the description), but its real length is 7.75 inches. It is too big for me."
2.0,"TL;DR: Please learn from my mistake, and if you want to buy these, BUY IN ADDITION TO ANOTHER ITEM so that it will come in an Amazon box and be protected.<br /><br />I got these to help with the healing process for my piercings -- just something simple that was surgical stainless steel. These are just that, but when I got them in the mail, they came in an envelope and the earrings themselves were just in a plastic baggie so of course, the mail being as rough as it is, almost all the earring posts were bent! I'm talking BENT 90+ DEGREES. 3/10 posts survived, but I was incredibly disappointed! I had to use pliers to straighten them out which compromises the metal (can create scratches where bacteria can grow and further infect your piercing). I would've given 1 star, but I'm still able to use the earrings."
2.0,This necklace is a piece of glass with pink paper glued to the back of it. It is not as pretty as the photo on line. I was very disappointed.
2.0,I have the exact same bra that I purchased in a store in the exact same size and some how this one fit 2 sizes too small?  All of my bra's are 36DD and fit fine.  This one was way too small to even be close to the correct sizing.
2.0,The square surrounding the text is unflattering upon wearing the shirt - returned.
2.0,"The idea of long gloves is good, but it is too stiff and hard to work with. Maybe with time it will become less stiff, and I will update my review accordingly."
2.0,Looks great in pic but not on. The size is off. Fit big in some places and tight in others.
2.0,"Did not unpack well. It was all creased and messed up. I couldn't ever get it to fluff the way it needed to, so I returned it."
2.0,"Well, this would have been perfect if the person who put it together read it first. Now I only have half of a present. Hopefully I will get half of my money back as well being that there is no time to return this item. Thanks!"
2.0,I ordered 8 of these dresses. 6 or them was fine the sequins comes off easy but overall they are good. The other two I had problems. I ordered a xl and recieved a large so I have to return it and order another size. Next I recieved a xl but the wrong color. I'm thinking they didn't have the color in the size I needed so they sent anything twice. Next I ordered a xxl. The company is based in china so the bigger size had to be made in China. And it was a huge miscommunication between me and the seller due to language barrier. So a lot of mistakes was made. I end up ordering the wrong size because I didn't know it was the same seller with a different name on the different sizes. Next they couldn't ship to my address due to it coming from China and can't ship usps. So I end up shipping to my Japanese home address but I did recieve the xxl after that and it was fine. But I'm giving two stars because of the situation and mistakes made. But the overall quality of the dress is great but it will do if I didn't have these issues I would give it three stars.
2.0,"I kept these and will use them but they are not like as pictured.  They are dull, not nice and shiny."
2.0,They run REALLY small.
2.0,"I previously had a stainless steel wallet from Stewart Stand and it lasted years. Although it went through stages of destroying my pockets when the metal 'frayed' on the edges until it smoothed out after a while. This wallet is a bit more compact but i've come to like it in the first few weeks. Then, the blue edges, on the bottom side of the wallet started to come off (It's been nearly two months since my purchase). The wallet itself isn't quite sealed under that, so it's about to die pretty soon. I'll be reaching out to the company about the warranty shortly. I'll update this post if possible with more info.<br />UPDATE: Warranty replacement was quick and painless via an email request. Once i snipped off the torn portion of trim, the wallet has good for a bit, but continues to degrade with edges starting to come off."
2.0,Item was good just not fantastic and would catch on other metal objects and take my watch right off
2.0,Update. I have worn the sunglasses for a week now and they broke near the bridge as I was putting them on. Definitely not buying again.
2.0,Very cheap looking out
2.0,Disappointed.  Very uncomfortable for a sandal that  is supposed to assist in supporting and comforting your foot issues.
2.0,"I read quite a few reviews about this dress prior to ordering. I'm surprised I didn't see a mention about the quality of the zipper. The dress is pretty and would have fit me... if I had someone else to help me zip it. The zipper is a flimsy dress zipper that goes from a few inches on the skirt to a few inches up the bodice. The fabrics are different, between the skirt and bodice. When I put the dress on, it fit great. I was able to get the zipper up to the &#34;transition&#34; part, where there is extra fabric underneath from where the skirt and bodice come together. I didn't have to stretch the fabric to make the zipper come together, but I needed to be able to hold the fabric together at the transition, pull the zipper, and still hold the fabric down at the bottom of the zipper in order for it to pull up. That would require 3 hands. Since I only have two, and there isn't always someone home to help me get dressed, I'm returning this dress. I'm 5'5&#34;, about 150-160 lbs. I wear small/medium tops and 6/8 in bottoms. The medium I ordered shouldn't have been so problematic. Like I said, it fit, but I feel like I should be able to dress myself alone at 45 years old. I thought about exchanging for a large, but then I'm afraid the bodice would be too big and the zipper still may give me problems, so it really isn't worth the hassle, unfortunately, as it's a beautiful dress."
2.0,I bought 3. 2 of the jewels fell out. I was really sad because they are really pretty.
2.0,"It fits my Oakley 5 squared, but the zipper is terrible."
2.0,"Sadly these are way too big...they didn't fit at all, they fell off.  Really disappointing as they seem to be an excellent product.  I even tried to have someone else try them on and they were too big for them too."
2.0,Very stiff and not soft.
2.0,"This is really cute, but these run so small. I could wearing standing, but not setting."
2.0,I ordered an olive green and got a light beige. Not happy about that. But it fits fine.<br />It would have been nice and appropriate to send a email to let me know.
2.0,"Shipped quickly, product works as advertised. The watch face is very small and hard to read the pictures don't express how small it is."
2.0,"The band fits well, snaps onto the charge easily, dries quickly when it gets wet, and the color holds up well and doesn't show stains or dirt. What I don't like is that it's double layered and the layers are starting to seperate."
2.0,Very oversized and not accurate . They would not let me return . These are not made like Kenneth Cole’s.
2.0,"Way too thin. Also this is not high rise only mid rise, so you will be hiking them up constantly every time you stretch. I can not only see my thong under them, but I can see the color of my thong under them. Pathetic."
2.0,"This is such a cute belly ring, but every time I put it in, within 5 minutes, the entire area around the post is sqwollen, red, hot to the touch. I initially thought maybe the charm was too heavy and was causing irritation, but I bought a similar ring, also in ""stainless"" and zero issues. Reading the reviews, there's definitely something going on with the metal in this one-- and I'm not sensitive at all to random metals (buy swap meet earrings, body jewelry, etc. all the time.) Such a shame because this really is cute."
2.0,Ordered mostly for green tuto which is a child’s size versus adult size which is why it was ordered!
2.0,"I was expecting something a bit more fitted and thicker, as you'd wear in a professional setting. The material was a thin, windbreaker-type material (you know, the kind that swishes when you walk?). The shoulders were way too large, which is weird because although I'm skinny I have a very wide shoulder and chest area. The arm rouching itself looked cheap and flimsy, but considering the price I couldn't expect too much more. I really wanted to like this jacket, the lapel is really cute, but the rest of it was a no-go for me."
2.0,"Very itchy, cheap material.  Perhaps a $20 dress, but not the quality for $70.  I had to return because very thin and can't handle the itch all night.  The fit was good, overall was flattering cut."
2.0,"The robe is not as pictured. It runs very small and shorter, knee length. The woman would have to be small to fit as pictured. Very disappointing."
2.0,"Feels like a decent blend that’s breathable. However, the collar rapidly stretches out big time after one washing."
2.0,I was looking for no elastic panties these have elastic
2.0,I wrote the number and name of the watch needing a band. This was too long for my watch
2.0,Are ok. They wear out screwing on
2.0,Too small for average hand size
2.0,Fabric is almost see through
2.0,Took out of packaging and found necklace broken. Disappointed.
2.0,Purchased these for my son to use as masks at his in person school. Loved that there were lots of color options. but they aren't thick enough to use as masks during this pandemic.  You can blow out a candle through it easily.  They might be good to keep dust out of your nose and mouth but wouldn't count on it keeping germs in our out.
2.0,"I bought this dress in a size 8 and emailed my measurements with another person double checking my numbers. The dress came to me faster than expected and from the hips down, it’s just right. The top, however, fit far off with the bust being three sizes too big. Unsure if it will be fixable due to the sequence-like top, I’ll have to bring the dress to a seamstress and pay more for alterations. Not worth the hassle of buying from afar, a nearby bridal store would have been better."
2.0,Strange should be  long
2.0,"It's not very shapely (the picture is misleading), it's a weird fit and it doesn't breathe. Give it a miss."
2.0,"Doesn't stay on ear, broke easily"
2.0,Make sure to size up. It is not loose fitting like it says
2.0,"So, make sure you really read the measurements section. I ordered a size 16. The size 16 is closer to a size 8/10. The pants are cute on my daughter but do not fit a curvy girl like me."
2.0,"I ordered the XS black and sadly returned them. I am 5'0&#34;, 110 lbs, and usually wear a size XS or XXS in Athleta leggings, and XS in Nike and Under Armour leggings. The fit was very, very tight - a size up might have been better for me. Unfortunately, the fabric also felt very rough - when I tried them on, I sat down on my bed and was afraid they would catch on my bedspread and cause snags in my duvet cover. Also, the light-catching dots weren't as apparent as I had hoped. Order and return process were very quick and easy."
2.0,"Got moisture inside the fourth time it got wet. Returned it and was refunded. Before that happened, I actually really liked it."
2.0,Well this band lasted for 3.5 months on my 9 year olds gizmo. I would at least expect 6 months to a year.
2.0,The fabric feel nice to the touch I didn't get to try it on because the pants had a whole in it. The thread had come undone
2.0,"Looked OK until the part where it connects to the watch randomly broke when I was sitting in a chair. Good thing I wasn't doing anything where my watch could have been lost, but that's what you get when you buy cheap stuff"
2.0,Turning a bronze color and leaves my wrist gray
2.0,Color is not as the image. Very bright red and the quality not the best. I ended up returning it
2.0,"Not a fan of the material. Other reviwers said after they washed it the material was fine but that wasnt the case for me. Its still itchy. Reminds me of those potatoe sacks that you used to see. Thick, rough material. It does run small and after you wash it it gets smaller. Im afraid to wash it again because if it shrinks any more i wont be able to use it. A bit dissapointed but i knew it was a risk due to brand and ordering it online without physically seeing the product. You win some and you loose some. I lost this time, oh well."
2.0,Product doesn't stay put at all I wrapped myself and within 15minutes it band had risen all the way up
2.0,No standard sizing. I ended up donating them. OH well. Otherwise good quality just wrong size.
2.0,"I ordered 2XL in another set and they fit just right but these are too small. Not sure what happened, the tag says 2XL."
2.0,These glasses are too heavy!!
2.0,Strap fell apart. Bought it for my vacation and it fell apart within a half hour of using! Can I get a  replacement for one that will stay together?? It was perfect for me….just started a 10 day vacation…..how disappointing ☹️
2.0,The dress looks cheap and the connecting seam at the waist is bulky.
2.0,I ordered a size 10 which normally fits. It was bigger than I expected. The straps were loose so it didn’t fit my foot well.
2.0,"Neck line is huge on my little baby, yet there is not enough room for a diaper in the crotch area. Very soft material. Will not repurchase. Maybe try the Parade Organics brand. I am tired of Carter’s zip ups as they fade easily and aren’t able to be passed down to another child. For reference, we bought a 6-9 month size for my five month old who is average length and on the thin side, 13lbs."
2.0,"I was looking for a good black winter glove and assumed I could not go wrong with a North Face product called Denali, but I was wrong.  My first mistake was that I did not try them on when they arrived and discarded all the packaging, so they cannot be returned or I would.  The first ""colder"" day I put them on I realized they were too small despite being the same size as all other gloves I have.  Wearable, but just very tight.  First sub 35 degree day I wore them to shovel snow and within 20 minutes my fingers were freezing and I had to change for my ski mittens.  I was hpoing to use them on a trip to Alaska, but that is not happening.  I gave the tw stars only because the etip works very well, otherwise it would have been one."
2.0,Looks better online. Seems cheap out of package. Packaging was not impressive. Made in China.
2.0,Not made truly made for the curvy woman.
2.0,"I bought these right before Xmas cause we were getting a cold front.  I wore them one day. It was our first major snow storm.  My hands were dry, but cold as the dickens."
2.0,"It's a cute necklace but it took forever to come in, and when it finally did I noticed that the eye is broken and has a chip in it. The paint is chipped off in some places too. For the price you get what you pay for, I wouldn't waste the money"
2.0,"For some reason the &#34;waist&#34; was around my ribs. I ordered a Large but at 5'6,I don't think the waist should be so high, almost empire cut. Fit more like a sack. Return."
2.0,It felt overwhelming on. Just too much skirt for me and the style was not what I expected. But so far the return experience has me baffled. Printing the label has been a chore. I had to increase the size  like 100 % so you can actually read it. Its like they want the post office to lose it. Its  bad enough this skirt is overpriced. I have to pay to send it back now and they tell me to send it back with a traceable method ( more money ) and they say it will take 2-3 weeks to process this return ( because of the volume of returns they have) WHAT? Isn't it scan and it goes back into the system? Isn't that why you have labels inside and out.? I spent 10 years in retail its not that hard.  You are telling me you have SOO many returns it takes 3 weeks to give me back my money?  STAY tuned AMAZON I will update and let you know what happens next.
2.0,"I’m a 36C and I ordered an XL. It’s so small, I can’t even get it on. Disappointed. Other than that, the quality appears to be good I think."
2.0,"My fingers were cold, then the pain set in at 35"" weather-"
2.0,I would love this product if it had some sort of adjustable mechanism because it is very long.
2.0,Not of great quality. Zip came off in just a few weeks time
2.0,"That watch it self looked great, from a far. As you looked at it close up it looked cheap. The leather band was so horrible would crease and leave lines in the leather. I could see that the band would soon wear out and I would have to replace it. Looked in Nixon website 85.00 for a new band. Returned ASAP."
2.0,Not flattering for plus-size. Cute though.
2.0,Keeps my feet super warm.  Shipping took several weeks.
2.0,"Not look bad, however does not lay on my neck, it's something wrong"
2.0,This might be good for a small woman or a child.
2.0,"The mask pin wasn't usable. It was white acrylic instead of purple for the background, it was full of bubbles, and the acrylic rose and covered almost half of the letters. Would not recommend."
2.0,I couldn’t get over how cool this design was and had to buy it for my brother’s girlfriend. One second she was wearing it and the next I saw everyone looking around the kitchen. It was gorgeous until the stone fell out and I was a day late to return it. Pretty embarrassing as her future sister-in-law.
2.0,The suit send is 100 poliéster .
2.0,I returned this hoodie because it was extremely uncomfortable. The material is so thick and stiff that the hoodie stayed somewhat propped up/open unlike every other hoodie I’ve ever owned. My long hair laid weirdly because of this. Just not flattering at all.
2.0,"This was supposed to be a sweatshirt but the material is very thin, not sweatshirt material that I was expecting."
2.0,Buy  1 size up. These boots run small. Had to pay to return them.
2.0,"It's a hairband. It does nothing to keep the seat out of my eyes. PLUS, it's very hot to wear"
2.0,I purchased these for my second hole and ended up with a horrible reaction to these. It was also very difficult to close the earrings when I tried to put them in either my first or second ear hole. These do not appear to be sterling silver.
2.0,There is a piece that is sharp and scratches your wrist.  Its too late to return it.  It is a nice bands and if it didn't have the sharp piece I would have given it 4 stars or better.
2.0,Their are not comfortable. The previous ones I bought  from the same brand was more comfortable.
2.0,These masks are too hot. Not breathable. Ok for cold winter months.
2.0,"not comfortable, has a large elastic band in the waist area and digs into your waist. light weight material and does not let your skin breathe"
2.0,"Very cute but super annoying to assemble. You have to punch out tiny holes, then string ribbon through them. Tying them on was also a pain as the ribbon was slippery. I was pulling kid's hair trying to get them on right and often failed. They lasted about 5 minutes before they started falling off."
2.0,"Sorry, get a bad review from me.  Backs so small I couldn't get them on.  Your silicone didn't help me at all.  Gave up and finally gave them to my granddaughter.  Her fingers work better than mine."
2.0,The slippers were too loose and not snug and the thread started to unravel and come out the back of the slipper.
2.0,"Returned.<br /><br />The fabric was like jersey fabric, super comfortable. The design was still pretty in person. However, the dress was shapeless and not what I wanted at all. It didn't look better with a belt. It was highly unflattering.<br /><br />Skip this option unless you're looking for a shapeless cover-up."
2.0,I don’t usually write reviews but the tool to adjust the strap broke as it is poor quality. Now I have to return this item due to the fact that it’s lopsided and I can’t even adjust it. Very disappointed.
2.0,"When I saw both the picture of this gown & the ""Pink Thrill"" advertisement, I thought I was going to get a gown that was going to have all solid pink stripes. The stripes are not all pink. The stripes are pink & orange. I was disappointed. I am going to return it & get something else."
2.0,Cute glasses but mine were already scratched when I opened the package.
2.0,I was not pleased with length.  Too much extra fabric.
2.0,The screw at the bottom fell out
2.0,Very odd fitting and poorly constructed.  I did not care for the fit at all.
2.0,Muy bonita e su entalle pero es calurosa
2.0,Dream catchers fall off way to easy
2.0,"These bras are great, but there is absolutely no padding.  I got it because it is high support and I need to support for running.  I did not want to have to double up on bras, but I'm going to end up having to because there is no padding whatsoever."
2.0,"the sizing is not what you think, the size I ordered was not the size I expected even tho it was marked as the size I ordered.  It also started to come unsewn on the hem of the shirt.  Seems cheaply made.  I should have returned it but kept it for PJ's, I wouldn't wear it in public."
2.0,Well for one thing it's not and  authentic Luminox watch band it's small in diameter and length I have and original one and you can  see that is a knock off  from the original one not happy for the price I will be returning it to the seller for my refund if you have small  wrist and not mind it's not and authentic one but for the price not worth 38.00 dollars.
2.0,"Very poor quality ""leather"". Lasted only a few months before it was so worn it fell off keychain."
2.0,"The size is not true to size, the fabic is stiff."
2.0,"A challenge as a designer is going from concept to execution and then editing or changing as needed. Whoever designed this skipped the editing step. I get the concept, and it’s not bad. The execution was a mess, however, and the weird flap at the side HAS to go. This looks terrible, and all it needed to be fixed was to remove the flap or make it bigger so it looked deliberate, but as it is, this is a visual skin tag in fabric, a weird flap that limply hangs there, looking like an accident or mistake instead of a design choice.<br />Looks like I have a new pajama that will never see the light of day. Yikes. So bad."
2.0,"Bras are a little small in the cup area, even with the pads removed. The fabric is very rough, and the back bunches where it twists."
2.0,I bought a medium wanting it loose. It's a small closer to a kids size. The decal is not bad though.. Only giving it 2 stars because my 9 year old girl can at least wear it and I don't have to return.
2.0,"This is way too big!  I bought this &#34;0 - 9 month&#34; coat for my mine month old and the item would be better for a 2 yr old.  The sewing on the coat isn't the best either.  The hood doesn't lay flat but if it's flipped inside out, it lays flat.  Be very wary of ordering this item.  It's coming from China so I was curious about the sizing for a 0-9 month, but did not expect it to be off by this much.  Hopefully she can wear this in a couple of years."
2.0,Only good if you have TINY fingers
2.0,The product I received looks nothing like the product that is pictured. What I received is more like sewing scraps. The material is so thin that you can see thru it. &#34;Made in China&#34; trash.
2.0,"When I received this watch I immediately tested the functions it offered, and the stopwatch function did not work.  It is a beautiful watch, a little bigger than I thought it would be and it was heavy.  I immediately notified Amazon I wanted to return the item and they made the process quick and easy.  I am very impressed with Amazon's customer service."
2.0,"I would consider these more like a leotard or thick pantyhose.  Actually, I probably have some pantyhose/tights that are less see through than these.  I am not a big girl (5 ft even, usually a small/medium) and even the black color stretched thin.  These will be okay under dresses but I definitely will not wear them with just a shirt or tunic."
2.0,Within 2 weeks or less of wearing this anklet it turned black.
2.0,"After 3 months of minimal use, the watch arms stop moving. It's a defective product."
2.0,"This did not fit me well and I am returning it. Bottom part was too tight, and the top was too large. The fastener/clasp in the back seemed very cheap, and that it wouldn't last in water and would break easily."
2.0,Design was nothing like picture. Looks inexpensive
2.0,Disappointed. I expected this dress to be floor length and it isn't. The split also is super high.
2.0,It is well constructed but it definitely too big...and it arrived 4 days late...
2.0,"Scuffed easily after 2 weeks of every other day wear, and the elastic on the left shoe broke!"
2.0,nose pads are loose.  Looks cheap to have pain so much for them
2.0,I was too tall (I'm 5ft 7in or so). It fit weird because the torso was so short even though I got the large size. I had to return it.
2.0,Image was upside down and blurry! Terrible quality and item arrived after both expected delivery dates!
2.0,To Small.
2.0,"Way too small, couldnt even fit around my nose."
2.0,Too bulky. Doesn't look good.
2.0,Pineapple was falling off after one day.
2.0,This product was made cheap. buyer be aware.
2.0,Overall the quality of this costume is not good at all. You’re better off buying pieces separately.
2.0,"Apparently, sizing is inconsistent.  One reviewer mention the torso was too long.  Ours was WAY too short, like Winnie the Pooh too short.  Shoulders and chest size would have been fine but this is almost like a men's crop top.  Very odd.  My husband is 6'2"" and 280 lbs.  HE normally wears a 2XL in Carhartts, which he loves. This shirt just failed.  Machine washing it just made it worse.  My first Amazon clothing piece that actually disappointed me."
2.0,Coat was to small. Size was more like a large. I normally wear 1x to xxl. Need to return
2.0,Too big for my female oval face. Returned them.
2.0,"Quite snug and smaller than they should be and much tighter than my RayBans that are the same size specs and design. Also, I don't think they look the same as when I tried them on at Macy's sooooo.....not quite sure if they're legit Burberry. Either way they are so tight they won't be worn often. Disappointing to say the least."
2.0,ONLY THE STEM IS STERLING SILVER NOT THE EARRING.
2.0,The color advertised was a bright yellow and I received a dark and dingy colored yellow that looks lixed in with other colors. Quality is excellent and I love the bag size. Disappointed to have to return it.
2.0,"When I got those jeans, I try it on and I didn't expected that it was too big on me because I wasn't sure the size that it was going to fit me. The reason I order that size was that I have lost lot weight and I wasn't sure if 13 or 14 was going to fit me. Anyway I do like those jeans, but they are way too big and too long."
2.0,Not what the picture shows
2.0,Material was very soft and flowy. Does not hug you at all so you have no shape when you wear it. I'm 5'3 140 lbs and a medium was ridiculously big on me.
2.0,Did not appeal to me once received.  The quality was not as expected.
2.0,I purchased these masks once before and they fit perfectly. The ones I received didn't have the piece to fit better on the nose and the ear straps are too big and easy to break
2.0,"I've had my buckle for about 2 months. It looks nice and is a good novelty item. It is not durable, I don't wear it everyday but the little I have worn it, it has broken... if you plan on putting it on a shelf, would be great. If you plan on actually wearing it and using it, don't waste your money."
2.0,"Pretty rings,  just too small and difficult to put in."
2.0,"Way too heavy to wear comfortably! There's no way I'd be able to wear them for more than an hour. It's too bad, I would have loved wearing them otherwise. Returning them."
2.0,I’ve had it and worn it for 3 days and already three small stones fell out. Very upsetting.
2.0,This is not silver. I bought this for my daughter but it lost its color and it was opening so easily. So i bought another one for her and i start wearing them. It lost color and turned yellow.
2.0,"Case colors are as shown.  Glass frame colors are muted and more orange than pink.  Christmas gift for my daughter.  If she doesn't like, I will return."
2.0,"This didn't last very long - I wore it 4 months and it was stretched out of useful size. Install was not easy, but on the bright side - it did stay put once attached."
2.0,"This looked exactly like the photo and is ""typically"" sized. However, before we had even washed it, the front pilled terribly.  It has a couple different fabrics and the dark gray pills easily. Very disappointed."
2.0,Based on the reviews I thought this would work. I ordered 2 sizes up after measuring my chest (42) and got a bust that was supposed to be a 45. The dress reeked of fish. The zip wouldn't close. And the cup that they have sewn in is awkward. It's like a pointy A cup. It sits weird. The waist comes up too high.<br /><br />The seller is making me pay for shipping to return. I've already lost $28 in expedited shipping.<br /><br />Very unhappy
2.0,Very cheap looking. Looked like the silver was painted on with a large house paint brush.
2.0,"Ended up taking it apart, cutting some length off of the longer strap, and reassembling. Not really worth the price for the quality, in my opinion."
2.0,"the dress is too short in the front. I will have to return it. otherwise, nice fabric."
2.0,already ripping after I wore it once...
2.0,It was great when I got it but one time thru the wash and it was trashed and I am very careful to wash as label said.<br />Made me super sad cause it was really cute!
2.0,Poor quality material is itchy
2.0,I wanted pink camo shirt loved the way it looked but the material was funky and it didn't wash well.  Bummer :(
2.0,"not what I expected, lacking in quality"
2.0,"The bag is nice however the 1st time I opened the zippers (2) and tried to close the rear zipper the handle broke off.  It appears that the metal is to thin where it attaches to the zipper itself.  I am sure that the same will happen to the front zipper.  I may be able to still use the bag by attaching a ring/handle to the zippers however I wanted to let other potential customers know that there is a problem with this item.<br />I like the bag as it is exactly the size, etc. that I was looking for, for what I want to carry in it on my belt."
2.0,Not my best Amazon purchase.
2.0,"This is a cute dress.  I’m a sucker for ruffles and this dress definitely has them!  I like the shape of the dress.  Unfortunately, the picture seems like a more coral color and the dress that I received is definitely light orange.  This is not my color, as you can see.<br /><br />My other complaint would be that the tie around the waist is a little awkward.  There is some elastic under the bust that gives the dress some shape, but can be exposed above the tied bow.<br /><br />Lastly, it can get super wrinkly.  It is especIally noticeable in this lighter color.  Maybe not as noticeable in the darker ones.  Being a mommy of 4, wife, and teacher, my motto is that if it has to be ironed in order to wear it, it’s probably not staying in my closet.  Therefore, this one is going back.<br /><br />For your reference, my personal measurements are:<br />Bust: 35<br />Waist: 29 - with a higher natural waistline<br />Hips: 36<br />Height: 5’4<br /><br />If you enjoyed this review and if you enjoy other great deals, you can follow me on IG and Amazon @prettycheapmama!<br /><br />Happy shopping!<br />PCM"
2.0,"The skirt looks and feels nice BUT you have to be gentle with it because it can rip very very easily. Insanely delicate. I have very lightly gotten it caught with my shoe (when going up the stairs, it has happened with other skirts before) and it ripped. I've fixed it three times now. Perhaps I'm too short for it, I'm 5'4, I don't know. It does look and feel nice though."
2.0,My husband has large legs and the largest size was still too small. The woman size that fits a shoe size of 7 fit me and my size 14 calves just fine.
2.0,The feeling of fabric. Very cheap and a scratchy feeling
2.0,I had to return this item because the lace edging was very uncomfortable around my underarms. It felt like my skin was getting rubbed raw.
2.0,To small. I ordered size 9 but didn’t fitted
2.0,"This dress was a disappointment for me. I read a ton of reviews before purchasing and thought it would look nice but it looks weird around the waist and also the lace doesn’t go all the way to the top of the lining on the bust so it looks cheap. The bust lines also are awkwardly placed. Finally, the lining is much more orange in tone than anticipated, just looks bad. The one plus is that it seems heavy and good quality. Maybe it would fit better on another body."
2.0,Jewelry was not what I expected for that price. Very small
2.0,"Not what I was wanting,  to long in the leg, to short in the shirt"
2.0,They are really thin and don't offer much traction
2.0,Runs small. Zipper on wrong side.
2.0,"I loved the look of this nightgown, but the armholes were tight and the fabric was stiffer than I like to sleep in, so I sent it back.  Disappointed."
2.0,Delivered in a crumbly unattractive manner. Fit is odd. Loose in all the wrong areas including shoulders. Really wanted to love this.
2.0,"I'm usually pretty generous with my reviews but this product didn't make the cut. I loved the look of the band. It broke after the fifth or so wear, as I was taking it off. It just ripped with little effort.<br /><br />Disappointed in this particular one but have ordered a few (and been gifted a few) from this company and all others have held up over a year. Just a fluke maybe. Would still recommend the band just be very, very careful taking it off, ha! Or just get a different band from this company - rose gold metal one rocks!!"
2.0,I am 5’7 160 pounds and bought a size Large. IT WAS TINY! I had my 12 year old daughter who weighs 100 pounds try it on and it fit her perfectly. Quality is nice it’s just way too small.
2.0,"I'm totally happy with it so far. I haven't had any problems and it suits my needs a lit more than dragging a big bag around all the time.<br /><br />UPDATE: Still holding up after six months of daily use, often with a textbook in it, filling it to capacity.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Strap ripped off completely, and a hole ripped in the side. It's cheap."
2.0,Light and comfortable. I ordered the Navy and has shrunk and faded on first cold wash. The pockets are also no the same as on the photos. It is located much higher and shallower. It’s all expected for the price. Not bad Noragi style jacket.
2.0,"The bracelet is fine, I like the design and the fit but I feel like the pictures are a little deceiving. The silver is brushed silver, not a shiny reflective silver like the photo. Wish it was shiny like the photo."
2.0,The locking mechanism becomes loose after a short time and watch falls off arm.
2.0,"I love Vionic shoes, but his particular style looks very matronly because the straps are too wide.  Vionic usually has cute shoes, but these miss the mark."
2.0,"For cheap leggings, these are ok. Definitely not high quality. Came shipped with a hole in them."
2.0,Not very well made. I've been using for about a week and already pieces are falling off.
2.0,"They don’t lift as expected, too small, don’t hold their shape"
2.0,Looks much different in person. Kind of looks like I put my grandmas curtains on myself. I ended up returning the dress.
2.0,Not sure about the product as a whole.  I’m a 36 waiste so I ordered an xl as I always do  Probably should’ve ordered a xxxl.  Couldn’t fit into xl
2.0,After the first cleaning the seems have started to come apart.
2.0,"Just a precaution. I have deleted the app immediately, so cannot say anything good about it. But mask itself looks ok. Has many preset animations. If it lasts for a few more day, I'm going to keep it. According to the user's feedback on the app, custom faces break built in animations anyway. So I'll stick to what was built in."
2.0,"This is the softest piece of clothing I have ever tried on. HOWEVER, the construction of the sweater is probably the worst I have EVER SEEN. Loose threads, white seams (I ordered black) and almost holes where they did a crappy job. It is beyond comfortable but it’s literally falling apart and I have only tried it on."
2.0,It fits nicely but it’s ripping on the inside of the material ! I looked at it today and just threw it away ! The material was cheap and I’ve only had it for 1 week wear til it started ripping !
2.0,The size is irregular.
2.0,"Very cute, but the pearls are falling off so I'll only be able to wear once or twice. It's also like a choker on me, necklace needs to be longer... I have to put an extender on it to wear. And I'm average size... No fat neck! Haha"
2.0,This appeared to be a regular sweatshirt but it's really short.
2.0,I am a normal extra large the sleeves were too tight around my arms and around my waist
2.0,This product is already pilly on the sleeves after wearing 2-3 times and I haven’t even washed it yet! Poor quality. Don’t buy it.
2.0,Runs small in waist
2.0,Mmmm not good. I’m size small in EVERYTHING and fit good. I saw the thing about the asian sizes so i ordered size Mediun cause they’re supposed run small<br />WRONG! The fit me HUGE! I should have order size small.
2.0,"I wanted to like this hat, but when I put it on it became instantly apparent that the color block style isn't working at all. It makes the already high crown of the hat look even higher. The velvet band is a little too thin for the high crown and the silky velvet material looks a little odd against the matte fabric of the hat.<br />Maybe for a bigger head it would work better, but for me I feel swallowed up wearing it."
2.0,Runs small/material is not chiffon. It is a textured material
2.0,"It is made well and is cute, but it is entirely too large. I get a medium in all of my shirts and this medium looks like an xlarge! It’s too long as well."
2.0,"The product looks great on picture but once you get it you will see what i mean. the main issue i have is with the pockets, once you try on the pants the pockets become a major issue as they show quite a lot as you put the pants on the pockets both in front and back raise up and create a bundle that looks horrible. which is extremely unfortunately because i really like the color and the material."
2.0,This item looks great but broke after 2 times wearing it
2.0,The top part of the glasses is blurry like it is prescription and the reader part is not as strong as it should be.  We ordered a 2.5 and it is more like a 2.  Would not order again.  Hard to order products like this without trying them on first.
2.0,I bought a medium and it was way too small for me. I'm 4'8 and 135lbs so this is kind of a surprise to me.
2.0,"While the set was very nice, the necklace seemed to be missing some links making what should be a necklace a very tight choker."
2.0,The earrings got so tight after a few hours I had to take them off.
2.0,the band on this watch was rough on my skin
2.0,The quality of the leather.  The lack of softness.  It's larger than i expected.  BUT most of all it is NOT A SMALL cross body.
2.0,Cool idea but doesn't actually work as a bottle opener.
2.0,in the photo look nicer than the real stuff.
2.0,"The waist is high, but not quite an empire waist.  It sits oddly between waist and chest and bunches."
2.0,These are rock hard on your foot!<br />Not the smooth support or Cush I was expecting.
2.0,Very thin but can’t complain much for its price.
2.0,The color in person is way more regular orange than burnt orange. The sleeves are a very distinct different material and kind looks awkward.
2.0,Screw came out after only using a few times. Returned for refund.
2.0,They aren't as warm as I hoped.
2.0,Muy gruesa
2.0,"There is always an open gap on the thumb piece so your skin is always exposed to the air (Adult male, average hand size). If you are doing something outside that doesn't involve moving your hands for any reason what so ever, they are great.  As soon as you open your hand up, grab a car door, steering wheel, shovel, etc. your thumbs tips get really cold. Im fighting to close the gap constantly. They are well knitted but poor fitted."
2.0,"its bigger then expected, and looks costumish."
2.0,Super cheap necklace. Basically a rubber string with super light weight plastic pieces on it. The colors are nice.. but spend a little more and get something better.
2.0,"Very pretty, but wayyy smaller than expected"
2.0,This gets loose all of the time.  I wish I could return it.
2.0,Super small. Fit in waist but not bust
2.0,"I ordered 10, only got 8 and they were not as pictured."
2.0,these shoes run small!!!!! SIZE UP
2.0,Earrings look awkward because they are soooo big. Also the product is cheaply made and not sturdy.
2.0,"Cheap material and short-tight around the chest, but loose around the middle-would probably make a good maternity top."
2.0,"I liked the print and colors of this dress and I loved the pockets. However, the material had no support in the chest area so it just flopped over it didn't cover me. Had to return it."
2.0,"The fabric this is made from feels like a parachute. Or a wind breaker from the 80’s. It’s a cute dress but no way could I wear it in Texas in the summer, it doesn’t breathe at all. It’s also much more fitted in the waist than it lets on in the pictures. Cute dress, really disappointed in the gross fabric choice though."
2.0,"Pros:  The color is beautiful, deep and rich. (Claret)<br />  The fabric is very soft and comfortable against the skin.<br />  The length overall would have been perfect.<br />Cons:  The front of the dress was about three inches longer than the back,<br />  and it looked very odd when on.<br />Overall, I am disappointed that the hemline was not correctly done,<br />otherwise I would have kept and enjoyed wearing the dress."
2.0,Did not meet expectations.
2.0,Cool material. Was supposed to be 3X fit like XL
2.0,"Ok for hiking, not made for snow!"
2.0,"The color is nice. But the fit is too small and the shirt is see through. And the front lace is odd. It isn't straight across the hem. Overall, this is not the top for a woman with a bust."
2.0,It broke after only two days....but it's cute...or it was cute.
2.0,Strap broke second time out... What a shame.
2.0,This looks like a very cheap product.  It might be that is doesn't fit properly.
2.0,not beanie material... its like a thin nylon that wont fit on your head
2.0,"They are light weight, but the ear pieces cracked and every time I took them off they pulled out my hair (got long hair). Guess they weren’t made well, back they went."
2.0,This fits true to size but is cheap. I bought this because of another review saying there was no show through and there is. I need something that doesn't show my nipples.
2.0,I love this dress but its not cut correctly.  The chest is completely  exposed. My breasts are out if I wear this
2.0,Too stretchy and way too long.  Very disappointing.
2.0,So cute but they are made for narrow feet
2.0,"Overall, I am pleased with these glasses for the price. BEWARE, I was buying these because they are shown as a tortoise shell color frame, while I recieved black frames. Consider this before buying!"
2.0,"It says 80% cotton, but feels like 100% polyester. Thick synthetic material. Other then that it looks and fits as expected"
2.0,This is at best a tunic and the twist effect on the front doesn't sit as pictured.
2.0,It look nice but it broke by the second day so disappointed
2.0,Ordered xl in men’s and it fits like a small
2.0,"I didn't care for this robe.  I liked the fitted belt initially, but then when you went to reach your arms up, the belt would pull and you could tell it wouldn't last long.  The robe wasn't long enough in my opinion, and the large pockets right at hip level made my hips look huuuge unless I adjusted them and smoothed them out every time I put the robe on.  No 'just throwing it on'.  I believe it was a Large/XL so it was trying to do too much at once.  I prefer a single size, otherwise most everybody is going to be unhappy.  Also.....and most importantly......I was surprised to find that the microfiber wasn't very absorbent.  I use my robe to dry off after my shower.  The microfiber didn't soak up much water and left me feeling wet underneath.  I returned this robe and went back to a cotton terry robe instead."
2.0,"Very disappointed as the set did not come as shown. Instead of a variety pack, I received 3 solid black pairs and 3 of the same gray heart design. Although the socks fit and work just fine, I paid extra for a variety of ""cute"" designs and did not receive what I paid for."
2.0,Nice blouse but I had to give it to my daughter who wears a small I order xL
2.0,The shorts for perfect the shirt is a big small.
2.0,"Poor quality, uncomfortable fabric."
2.0,"Got this in blue.. Really don't care for it. Looks cheap. First thing I didn,likem"
2.0,I ordered a 2xl but it runs really small.  This is more like a large.  It looks great on and is warm but it was intended as a gift for someone else but because of the size I kept it.
2.0,"Had to change the battery 2 weeks after I received it, and it still doesn't run very well."
2.0,"Thin polyester, cheap looking dress with no shape or form and threads sticking out everywhere."
2.0,"The picture made this look loose and drapey.  Instead it was almost tapered in at the bottom.  I am a large and ordered a Large to get the effect of the picture, but to get this look I would have had to order an XXL.  I was disappointed.  I was looking for a loose and comfortable shirt, but this top was not like the picture."
2.0,Fit is good but the waistband is too narrow and rolls up.
2.0,"I absolutely adore Octopuses and was so excited to find this dress! The colors were just gorgeous!! Unfortunately, the dress quality was poor. The top of the dress, the black portion, has strange seam going up the center of each breast. It makes it very strange looking and leaves a pucker at the top of the breast seam. It's awkward and doesn't make sense to have it there. Also, the skirt starts way too high on the dress, making you look quite heavier than you really are. I would say on me (5'9 175lbs) the skirt line starts about 3"" above my belly button. It left me with a strange ""bubble"" effect. The satin of the skirt is unforgiving. It's stiff and doesn't ""move"" making the high cut make me look like a stiff cupcake. I was super disappointed because it looks just beautiful online. Note, I did have to return my original size and to a higher one and it did not make a difference. Even though it didn't work out for me, the return process was quick and simple, so it's worth buying to see if maybe it works better on you and your frame.<br /><br />I give 2 stars because it wasn't complete garbage and the return process was so easy."
2.0,"Not very stretchy, clearly for women who have very thin legs."
2.0,couldnt get my foot into shoe
2.0,"This was the black version. One if the above pics looks light gray. It is more washed out due to flash. The shirt is still, however, more gray than the black in their provided picture. I would be totally fine with that except that the fabric looks completely different than their pictures. The fabric in the picture drapes nicely and looks like most of the texture is in the fabric itself. The actual shirt is completely different. It is essentially like a less stretchy tee shirt material.  The texture is entirely printed onto the fabric. Looks like a light stone wash.  The shirt looks okay, but not nearly as cool as the shirts in the pictures. I was very disappointed."
2.0,It's a cute dress and the quality is good for the price but skirt level was uneven.  One side was higher than other.  Also the label tag is on the outside of side seam so it really ugly.
2.0,I loved the way this dress fit me. It was very comfortable and flattering but the material used was so cheap looking almost like a tablecloth or bedsheets. So disappointed because it could have been such a great dress. Don’t waste your time/ money with this one!
2.0,Band is not bad. I love the design. My low rating comes because the band hasn’t been wet or anything else and it’s almost completely faded. It looks terrible now and the color is a brown form fading and no longer black. My recommendation would to either find an already black band to put the decks on or not to use black or any darker colors due to fading issues.
2.0,Just wish the posts weren't so sharp
2.0,Zipper broke in two weeks
2.0,"The idea for the bag is great, it's a perfect bag if you go to the gym right before work. But the materials are flimsy and after a few months of use, the bag will be floppy as it hangs from it's hook. The wires used to shape the bag aren't exactly hard so the back quickly loses it's nice ""curve"" shape. That, and the shelves aren't stitched in. They're removable and secured by 4 clips on each corner, which is a great idea if you want to remove the shelves, but causes any small things stores on those shelves to fall through the cracks and fall the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I think this bag has great potential, but could use a few fixes for a ""version 2""."
2.0,Ordered two dress same size... ordered a large in this particular dress and I couldn't even fit it over my chest! There is no give in the fabric.
2.0,"We liked these and they look great on, plus are light and comfy, but they fall apart very easily. Within 2-4 times of wearing them, my husband has come home sarcastically laughing (and a little embarrassed) to show me the large holes where his package was no longer being held in by is underwear...given he bends often at work, but still, they should last longer than they did."
2.0,"Doesn't help with headlight glare, fogs up.  Only thing I liked about them was the sturdy frame but even it was kind of heavy.  Didn't serve any purpose whatsoever."
2.0,To tight in the arms...only for an extremely thin skinny person....not enough stretch in the material.
2.0,"First, let me preface by saying I had high hopes for these pants because I own 4 or 5 pairs of the shorts which are great.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the design of these pants just don't work (at least for me and I don't know how they could possibly work for anyone else).  The padding is sewn in way too far forward.  I just rode 48 miles today and was pretty miserable the entire time because of the padding placement.  It seriously makes no sense.  While seated on the saddle, the rear portion of the padding sits right on my perenium (or taint, gooch, whatever you choose to call it).  The rest of it bunches up uncomfortably forward in the groin region.<br /><br />I would strongly look for other options out there.  These are terrible.<br /><br />Its such a shame, too.  The construction seems very solid and the overall fit is great.  The ankle zippers are nicely done and the zippers are smooth.  I really wanted to like these and thought it would be a slam dunk since the shorts have been so great.  Unfortunately, they dropped the ball and the padding placement makes them nearly useless."
2.0,"I ordered this twice thinking what I first got was an error.  I ordered these pants and got flannel jammie bottoms. The plaid pattern that I got is completely different- maroon and dark grey only- not tartan.  So, I sent them back for another pair.  I got the exact same pants.<br /><br />They took quite a long time to arrive, each of the two times.  Given that, I will keep these to sleep in.  Absolutely not work appropriate, event at elementary school level."
2.0,Unfortunately the description doesn’t include that the character isn’t included. This is only the purple backpack.
2.0,This shirt didn’t come with a button on back.  Once I take the time to put one on I can’t say for the performance of shirt.
2.0,The shirt ripped even before washing. Comfy but cheaply made.
2.0,Just received this hat and it is too small for my 9 year olds head. This is a YOUTH size hat. Wish the seller had put this info in the posting. I also paid extra shipping to receive it in time for the first day of school. My son is very disappointed and will not be able to wear it. We would not have ordered and paid express shipping had we known it was a youth size hat!
2.0,"Runs very small, not very good quality."
2.0,not as fitted as I like and length is for a tall person I'm 5'2&#34;
2.0,Not what I expected. It looks red online but once you get it's an off red
2.0,Didn’t realize it was stained until after I washed it:/ so inspect it before washing it.
2.0,The leather (if you can call it that ) is so thin and flimsy Im sure the slightest thing will rip it. Really dont waste your money. This can't be leather plus it stinks like chemicals..
2.0,"Nicely made except the metal piece is not centered, so one side is much longer than the other."
2.0,Much bigger than I expected - will be giving them away as gifts because I won't wear them - too gaudy. :(
2.0,"LARGE FITS TOO LARGE, MAYBE ORDER 1 SIZE SMALLER."
2.0,"This item is so pretty! The print is subtle, and the yellow color is beautiful. However, the fit is so weird. The size 18 months didn’t fit well on a 6 month old who is 17 pounds and 27 inches in height. She is in the 30% percentile for height and weight for a 6 month old and the bottom half fit well. The top was loose. I could always tie the strap and clip it here and there, but it’s not ready to wear."
2.0,"I wouldn’t recommend this product for smaller women... the color was way too bright, and it looked and felt like I was wearing a neon trash bag :("
2.0,It’s just really cheap. Almost cute but the slip inside is like weird boob pad you can see through.
2.0,Love love this top. Very pretty however The arms on this top are so tight its unwearable
2.0,not puffy like as above
2.0,It fit but is way too short in the back so you butt is literally out.  Probably cute if you're very slim with small cheeks lol
2.0,"These bangles are silver in color but are not stainless steel, that’s shouldn’t be in the description. Stainless steel is a harder metal. There is a copper color under the silver....dinged as soon as I started working with them."
2.0,Material shrunk after first washing
2.0,Chain is silver (different color than the pendant). My pendant has a gap on the other side of it which I hope is only a manufacturing error and mine is an exception rather than a norm. I would like the chain to be a little longer and the pendant a bit smaller.
2.0,Fit was terrible for someone who has a little belly
2.0,"Cheaply made, breaks & falls apart."
2.0,Too big double check that you want this size.
2.0,"Nice little watch, but the bail is very poorly made. It fell off of the watch and will not stray when put back on."
2.0,"These socks were so tight and stiff that I sent them back.  I think they just must have different ""batches"" and they aren't all the same.  Reading of some reviews now, I think, ""There's no way these people had the same socks that I received.""  So, it's a gamble."
2.0,swam in the water one time and it changed color....very very cheap.
2.0,One of the backs would not fit and the pist bent. Had to find a different back and fix the post. Very unhappy with them. Pretty to look at though.
2.0,Unfortunately I bought two pairs and they were not squat proof. Had to return them.
2.0,👍🏽The dress was great 👎🏾Size too small.
2.0,"I had to returned this dress. Bought a Small, I'm usually a size US 0-2. 5'1&#34; 105 lbs petite slender athletic. Too large everywhere."
2.0,For such an expensive glove (retail) this glove lacked the softness and workmanship expected. Sent back for refund.
2.0,"The shirt fit nicely but the design got messed up after the first wash. I bought this shirt for my daughter to wear to her 6th birthday party, so I’m glad I did not wash it before she wore it."
2.0,"The dress was very nice.  Fabric was thicker than expected, probably hot for the summer.  I am 5', 104 lbs and the XS was too long and too big/wide.  I returned the merchandise."
2.0,Way too small. Cute though so I plan on adding an extender.
2.0,"This fit very well.  BUT the fabric is awful.  It's an unbreathable viscose that cannot be worn in the summer.  Feels almost like thin velvet.  If cotton, would have been perfect."
2.0,I could not fit foot in it might help if you gave range of size it fits
2.0,"The shirt did fit as expected, but came with a hole in the shoulder. Then, after just a few washes, the lettering started cracking and falling off.<br /><br />Beware, this is not a good quality product."
2.0,"It started to rip where loop for neck connects to rest of the apron within in a few weeks of first use.  Material used not very thick. They looked nice, but wish the quality was better."
2.0,When I opened the underwear it had some kind of crusty booger on it.  Yuck!
2.0,"There is a giant ""Fashion"" on all the wrists of the sleeves.  Interesting how the pictures does not display that."
2.0,Much smaller than pictured. Material seem durable. Price is right
2.0,"I really loved the images of this in the listing, but the dress was BAD in person. It didn't flatter me, the fabric was scratchy, the under-dress was revealing and unattractive. It felt a little snug as well."
2.0,"It's pretty... Looks nothing like the pictures. But i mean it's pretty. It's cheap and it looks even cheaper. This looks like you paid 50 cents and got it out of one of those little bubble vending machines at the front of K-Mart. You know, when K-Mart was still a place people shopped at and existed. I guess it's a good thing I was getting this cause I like religious things for kitschy reasons and not for ACTUAL religious purposes otherwise I'd probably be livid."
2.0,Can not get the hat to hold shape.
2.0,"I purchase these based on reviews. I am 5' 10"" and weigh 160. The large was huge. I have baleaf leggings and they are size large. These were very soft but ordered them in medium...Hopefully they fit!"
2.0,"Was pretty disappointed in this shirt. It's not a typical ""sweat shirt"" material. It's very thin and ""silky"". It also runs really big! I ordered a medium for a bit just into size 10/12 and it was huge! Will be returning."
2.0,"I do love this watch, however, this is the second one I've received and the battery is dead or doesn't work at all. Please let me know if there is a way to resolve this short of returning it again. I am willing to take it to a watch shop for a new battery but that would incur an extra cost for a new watch. Thanks."
2.0,"I honestly didn’t like either item included in this. First, the gloves are incredibly thin and the fit feels like work or gardening gloves. I was unable to pick the size of the gloves so they came in a medium though the fit more like a large and would probably be best suited for mens hands.. the are in no way feminine and very loose fitting. They just have an over cheap feeling quality and I definitely will need to wear more than one pair of gloves with these to stay warm.<br /><br />Worse, the hat is very uncomfortable. It is scratchy, not soft at all. The ear flaps are the worse. They do not form well to my ears and just sit uncomfortably over them.<br /><br />That all being said, you are getting two items for under $20 so i didn’t expect high quality but, these feel like dollar store items to be unfortunately blunt. They will keep you warm but the quality and fit of each is seriously lacking."
2.0,hard to lock
2.0,"this dress is beautiful and i was pretty excited about receiving it today, but i took it out of the package and there were no tassels at all or string for that matter and it was not in the pkg. either, leading me to believe it was packaged and sent that way. not an accident during shipping, but anyway the top button is coming unraveled and even though these are just for looks it mattered to me, but not enough to return it... i tried on the dress and its to small, i wear a size 16 in pants so i ordered the XL. according to the chart. the rest of the dress fit pretty well and is very pretty, but i have large hips so the slits on the dress are wide open (and quite high) i guess if you are smaller this may be a good dress... assuming it comes as it should, which mine did not. i would like to add that there are strings hanging everywhere and around the under bust looks like the sewing needle got stuck there is a fairly large section of visible strings knotted together. The reviews on this dress are pretty well all good so i gave it 2 stars in thoughts that it may have been an error on my dress however, i would not recommend it to anyone."
2.0,"I ordered a set of these on 7/23/13 and received them on 7/25/13.  They seem to work fine, so I decided to order two more sets on 7/29/13, clicking on the link in my 7/23/13 order to make sure I got exactly the right item, and expecting that I would receive them two days later.  The order was shipped on 7/30/13.  Today, I checked my order status and learned that it is expected to be delivered by 9/10/13 - that's right, six weeks after shipment.  Obviously, you need to pay more attention than I did regarding shipping times, even if you are ordering exactly the same item for the same price."
2.0,This dress was so see through and unflattering. I'm 5'4 and 115lbs and this looked horrible. I like clingy dresses but this seemed to cling in all the wrong places and made me look bigger.
2.0,I've tried using them on many occasions but they're too bulky and end up hurting the backs of my ears.
2.0,"This ran way small, I even went up a size from my normal dress size and it still didn't fit, decided to return.  Very cute dress though, seems well made."
2.0,Looks cheap and they don't stay in very well.
2.0,The sizing is incorrect!
2.0,"As many others have noted, the ruffles are too close to the bust line.  They don't lay flat/smooth along the side of the dress.  The dress size was the right one for me, but it the fabric and/or design wasn't flattering."
2.0,"Cute little summer dress - especially for the cost. But it's sized for a person no taller than 5 ft. I'm 5'8"" - so I know I'm taller than average, but short dresses reach at least mid-thigh on me. This one didn't even cover my butt - it's shorter than a t-shirt. The length from the corded waist to hem is only 13"". Pretty comical :)"
2.0,It is very small and short. I would recommend it for a child or for a costume. I needs something under it.
2.0,"If you’re looking for cheap glasses for any costume or cosplay, this will get the job done.<br />But if you’re looking for a durable and useful product forget about these.<br />The materials used in these glasses feels very cheap and poor quality, also you won’t be able to use them to see anything because the glass is very dark.<br />Hope this helps."
2.0,Mush smaller charms than expected.  All are one sided and tiny.  Not what I wanted or expected.
2.0,I returned this item because it is not yellow. It is the same gold color as the review stars.
2.0,Not very strong. Purchased a pink and black one and they both broke within 4 months. The fur doesn't feel as soft as other rabbit fur that felt.
2.0,Add indicated used in very excellent condition.  when received had several stains and scratches in the back. very disappointed even though what I paid for it seemed reasonable but the description of the products was not as it indicated.
2.0,"It is advertised as a &#34;One size fits all&#34; which seemed a little... impossible? But I decided to give it a try anyway because it looked so comfortable. On arrival, the top portion of this top is roomy and fits as pictured, but the bottom was sewn so tight that it would most likely only fit up to a size 8 typical American female frame. I returned it without issue and was given my refund quickly."
2.0,The jeans look nothing like the picture.  I was really looking forward to that particular color ripped jeans....
2.0,Dead looking.. no pizazz. Also runs a bit small
2.0,"Didn't love this dress... The material feels thin, cheap & not soft."
2.0,Should have fit but it’s tight.
2.0,"Fabric inside bag feels like it's plastic or coated with plastic. Purse is cute, just couldn't get past the quality of the liner inside."
2.0,Not as sturdy as my past purchase of these.  Thankfully the female end for car keys work with my original solid and sturdy male ends bought a decade ago.
2.0,I didn't receive the pins to attach this to my watch.
2.0,"I was very disappointed with these pants. The pants were loose and not tight after wearing them for a long time. After wearing them for the second time, the seams behind the hips began to crack, so I could only give 2 stars."
2.0,"It is a really cute shirt, it fits nicely IF you order sizes way too big. I wear a medium/large shirt typically. I ordered a 3X in this shirt because I wanted it extra baggy. It fits some what snug."
2.0,"I bought this for a cosplay, and I guess it’s fine for that, but the skirt is made out of a very flimsy material and the texture is terrible. It feels like something won out of a claw machine. Several threads on the product are loose and I wouldn’t be surprised if it starts falling apart the more I wear it. On the positive side the color and size match the images. I bought a medium and it fits well."
2.0,The butterfly is massive- unless that’s you’re thing I wouldn’t buy again. I was expecting a small cute butterfly.
2.0,"Out of 3 hook and ring clips 2 were good, but one had 2 hooks and no ring."
2.0,What a cheap pant！
2.0,"Very thin fabric. It's see through, and the fabric doesn't give. I was afraid it would rip when sitting down even though the fit was fine."
2.0,Very cheaply made.  Huge crease on the pocket.  It isn't  a chunky knit.  It just lays there.  Sending it back.
2.0,"Loved the fabric, the stretch and the color (black) but even at 5'4&#34; it was too short. Besides that, which might be what someone else would like, there is a design flaw that I couldn't get over. At the front seam of the dress around the neck line it has that &#34;flap&#34; of material that some dresses that give it an incomplete feel as well as bunches. Having had this on other dresses I know with a wash it will fold up and I would constantly be tucking it back in. I returned."
2.0,"fits very small, seller would not accept it back"
2.0,"Nice dainty set. Nice chain. Hugely disappointed in color of stones. Advertised by title, and photo as Pink Pearls. Pearls arrived as silver gray."
2.0,"Though I had correct size, they’re small, cant use. I tried two of the pairs. Very colourful though. Too small"
2.0,The skirts that well however the top was in very small and is meant for someone that is size 2 the costume overall was very nice
2.0,"It was just another bag, just happened to have pretty pictures of various chargers on front. I was looking for something that would assist me in organizing the cords more effectively, rather than just another basic bag/pouch."
2.0,"I am 6'1"" tall, 175 lbs., with a medium, muscular build, as I lift weights several days/week.  I typically wear size Medium clothes, as I detest the big, sacky look of larger clothing.  The listing here said that it was form fitting, and that if I wanted a looser fit, I should order the next size BIGGER.  I did not, as I wanted the form fit.  So, I ordered size Medium.  I was SO DISAPPOINTED that the hoodie is still way too big for me.  It looks terrible--nothing like the one pictured on the model.  So, in order to maybe get that look, I would have to order a SMALL?!?  I have never worn size Small in anything ever.<br /><br />As an Amazon Vine Reviewer, I cannot exchange for the right size.  I'm just stuck with this oversized hoodie.  Bummer.<br /><br />Beyond the sizing issue, I do like the hoodie.  The quality of fabric and construction is good.  Further, the price seems very fair.  I only wish the sizing was right.<br /><br />Take my word for it and order a size SMALLER than you'd normally wear, if you want to possibly get a form fit like shown on the model in this listing.  Good luck!"
2.0,Way too much money for this ring.
2.0,Fits and feels like a burlap sack.
2.0,The front of the item was so short and just odd! And the back was scrunched up funny and uneven. If you give it a try I would size up.
2.0,"This product is paper thin for a sweater and the material is weird almost plastic-like not soft at all. Feels almost water resistant or something. Also, the top itself is large like shown but then the sleeves are not quite to your wrists which makes an awkward fit unless you have short arms. The colors are nice but this just fits too awkwardly for me and the material isn’t great."
2.0,The seams are already coming apart & I have only worn them about 5 times
2.0,"Unfortunately it didn’t fit me very well, so I had to return it. Although the material did feel comfortable."
2.0,"item was delivered on time and as expected.  At first i liked it and it worked as expected.  Unfortunately, the elastic did not hold up and after a few weeks, there is not much stretch left in it."
2.0,Fabric is too thin. Runs small
2.0,"Huge, odd armholes kill it for me. Everything else is great. I'm usually an XS (0-2) and ordered in a small because there were no reviews yet. The armholes show a ton of side boob- easily my entire boob if I lean over (30C). At 5'3&#34; this hits me right above the knee and the flowy fabric in the body is a good cut. Liner extends to the waist so this definitely needs a half slip. I especially like the neckline but will return or re-sew to from from flashing everyone."
2.0,just okay.  I returned it.
2.0,Very cute but turns very quickly
2.0,"This top is absolutely the cheapest junk! It is made of bright white, scratchy polyester &quot;lace&quot;.  It does not drape as in the photo, but is cut like a very straight tunic with midlength bell sleeves.  For this top, think clearance rack at Ross.....it went directly into the donation box."
2.0,The top of this shirt is way too baggy. I will be returning it
2.0,"I have very wide calfs and was hopeful that these would work for me since they went up to the measurement of my calf. Unfortunately since I'm 5'2"" they don't work since the part of the boot that goes over the widest part of my leg wasn't actually the 22"" part. I didn't give them 2 stars for that though, since that couldn't be helped. I was able to squeeze into them, but they had absolutely no support or cushioning in the bottom. Even if they had fit comfortably I would not have kept them."
2.0,The material was a lot thinner than I had expected.
2.0,arm holes are extremely small
2.0,Ordered one before and the beads kelp sliding but held up for awhile. Second time I ordered it was way to small 😕
2.0,The sizes are not true
2.0,It looks nice just way to small. I would probably order 2 or 3 times bigger than what you normally wear.
2.0,The straps on the back broke after he only wore them 2 times. He is not rough on his shoes either.
2.0,very cheap looking material
2.0,The fabric felt kinda gross reminds me of a hospital blanket. The seams were coming undone and overall just wasn't flattering on me.
2.0,"Decent tanks....very thin but they do the job. However, $30 is way too overpriced for these and the quality. Would be more reasonable for about $15 for 3 if that....they are very thin and lightweight."
2.0,Cute but very cheap. Things were breaking immediately. Not safe for a child.
2.0,"It looks great, arrived promptly… the only downside was that the clasp broke after 3-4 uses. It wasn’t a link I could repair. It was the clasp itself so without a replacement clasp, I couldn’t repair it. So if you’re okay with this basically being a disposable item that you just get a few uses out of, it’s very cute."
2.0,"Got the bone (2 LED bulbs) and heart (1 LED bulb) tags for our outdoor cat. I figured after one poops out, I could switch to the other. Well, the heart tag didn't work right out of the package. I opened it up, checked for anything blocking the contact points with batteries and switch. I fiddled with the prongs holding the cell batteries to increase contact. After putting it back together, the bulb would flash once and then stop. I jiggled the switch and got it to continuously flash for about 2 hours worth of use. Yes, it made my cat more visible around the rush hour/dinner hour time window. After that, he comes indoors for the night. We also use the reflective + glow-in-the-dark collar by Rogz [[ASIN:B003V4ARLE Rogz Catz Small 3/8-Inch Glow Cat Safeloc Breakaway Clip Adjustable, Reflective and Glow-in-the-Dark Cat Collar, Gecko Design]]. Unfortunately, the heart tag stopped working after that ONE use. I suspect the switch is defective. The bone tag continues to work, but is larger and heavier and seems to bother my cat a bit since it swings around as he walks - and he is a good sized cat at 14 lb."
2.0,Very cheap fabric. Small af.
2.0,Scratches easily!
2.0,Graphics on the tank top seem faded not as bright as the pictures.
2.0,"I like the idea of the bag but it came in a flat package, so it will not ever hold itself upright as shown in the picture. It stays in a crushed position, and it doesn't help that the top holds items which makes it heavy and crushes it even further. It's annoying. Too bad, since I love my other Thirty One items."
2.0,"I had previously used paper cloths (Connoisseur), where one first wet the silver and then wiped it, removing all tarnish.  These worked great and were available on Amazon but for TWICE the price offered by Bed, Bath & Beyond (where I previously bought them).  Since I was ordering other items from Amazon, I decided to try this product.  I was very disappointed."
2.0,"Very larg and not as chic as the picture. The material is very strange; the picture makes it look a little rough like wool, but the actual material is extremely smooth and cheap looking; something you'd expect an airline blanket to be made out of. Not what I was going for in an outter coat at all. The collar isn't very flattering either. Returning it."
2.0,When ordering this shirt I was so excited for it to show up. I order this shirt in an extra large. When I tried it on it didn't even fit over my shoulders let alone my stomach area. :( makes me really sad that it didn't fit.
2.0,"Both the top and the bottoms were too small, the top especially."
2.0,"Material is thing and although it says it stretches, the material is more like a nylon jacket.  I am a size 10, and I am not a fan of this material. It outlines every flaw I have and the pants also run a size smaller than I normally wear.  Quality material and make.  Lightweight material would be great for warmer months.  My main complaint is how they fit on my size."
2.0,"I love this ring! It's very well made, the gems are stable in the groove and don't wiggle at all like with a lot of jewelry. The ring fit just as expected. The metal is high quality and is super smooth! Would definitely buy other jewelry from this seller again!<br /><br />Edit: About 4 weeks after having this ring, the colors have faded on the ring. The gems themselves are not colored as I thought they were. There is simply paint underneath clear cheap gems that gives it the colors. I learned this when I wore the ring into a pool. The metal itself is great, but the gems are super cheap and painted underneath. Such a shame. It was a cute ring until it washed out :(<br /><br />-<br /><br />As a wife and as a mom of 3 kids, I spend a lot of time shopping for deals on the best products out there for my family. It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplating purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a 3rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. My family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review. When I write a review, I keep in mind that those reading are also looking for honesty about the product and want an unbiased opinion to go by. If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a &#34;Yes&#34; vote on my review. Thank you!<br /><br />Note: I received this product free or at a discount and I am reporting my honest review."
2.0,When the size label is removed from the front left leg you will need goof off to remove the glue. Like the pants but a lot of work to make a new pair of slacks wearable.
2.0,Didn't get what was shown in picture. Not happy.
2.0,"The glasses are decent quality but the internal reflection on these makes them unpleasant to use. Unlike other, more expensive, sunglasses I own, these cause a visible reflection of your own face in strong sunlight. It's not intolerable, and you can learn to ignore it, but it's definitely not something I would buy again."
2.0,The paint wore off the edges after a week of wearing and I don’t wear it every single day.
2.0,I order a 10 but it was more like a size 9 it was too short.  I wish I could have gotten a real size 10
2.0,It was pretty for a little girl but not for a woman to wear
2.0,"Not very costly - but not great quality. Sized as a large/XL but fit like a small. Nice colors and pattern, though.  Gave them to a tiny friend who seems happy with them.  Also - long wait for arrival.  Took over 2 months to come to my home."
2.0,Ok not like on pic..but ok!
2.0,Not for plus size women....
2.0,"My buddy didn’t come with a face, and that was the whole reason I got it. I don’t think it’s worth the price."
2.0,"I ordered SKZ and they gave me Day6, i'll still keep it but i really wanted stray kidsss TwT and it's really small like 4cm in length"
2.0,Item lacks structure and waistline a bit small for a large size. I’m 5’4 and too long for me.  Nice color however.
2.0,It’s cute but thin and flimsy. I bought it for my daughter. She loves it but I would have returned it. She hasn’t worn it yet either. It’s more of a summer cover up type of dress.
2.0,"All the compartments are too flat.  So it would work for somethings but I was looking for a more all in one travel Bag.  Not this one for tiny things and a bigger one for everything else.  I gave it to my niece for color pencils, pens, markers  and other art supplies since they’re relatively slim."
2.0,The nosepiece fell off of these after one wear. Disappointing
2.0,"Quick shipping and like the material, but way to small.  I ordered a size up so they would be baggy to sleep in.  They actually fit like a size or two smaller.  Seller was quick to refund money."
2.0,Didn’t really end up liking it. Didn’t hold the coin very well—it was pretty loose. But with a thicker medallion it would probably be perfect
2.0,"This set is more of a yellow gold, it's not a soft gold like it seems to be in the photo online. The quality is very nice."
2.0,They are cozy and comfortable but run way too small.  Would not purchase again.
2.0,After spending several minutes of fighting with the dress to find where you’re supposed to put your neck thru I feel the neck area looks kind of cheap. Dress goes below the knees and looks nice despite thing material but very uncomfortable on the neck
2.0,"Well stitched, great size and length but the material was not the best quality"
2.0,I ordered an large and it was too small. So ordered an XL and it measured smaller than the large when laid on top.<br />Messaged the company and they sent me another XL and it wasn't any larger.<br />Disappointing as the kimono it's self is really cute.
2.0,Nice watchband except that the the clips to connect to the watch are upside down.
2.0,The top part around the neck is very tight and felt like it was choking me. It was not comfortable in that area.
2.0,Product was good except I only received 4/5 that I ordered for a wedding.
2.0,"Okay first of all, Nothing like the picture!! The words are a light purple, not white, one side of the band the second D and part of the A is cut off by the holes to tighten the watch on your wrist. Got this for my husband from our son for Father’s Day, and very disappointed. Will be returning after he sees it tomorrow! And promising him a much better one! Very disappointed."
2.0,Didn’t like the high waist
2.0,They took very long to come they were too small and they tarnished very quickly
2.0,I found the sleeves to be a little tight on this top.  I also found the material to not be forgiving if you have any bumps or bulges on  your body.  It was just not flattering to someone who is a little overweight.
2.0,I know I didn't pay much for this watch but it is not worth it.  It looks like a five dollar watch .
2.0,I just don't like these glasses. They feel cheap and look funny. I didn't like the first pair and was sent another pair for free. I appreciate the customer service but would rather have just received a refund.
2.0,too big of lenses
2.0,I’m pretty sure the seller replaced a previous listing because many of the high star reviews describe a completely different dress. This dress is not the dress pictured. The fit is not flattering like the model and it just lays funny.
2.0,Order a large
2.0,"i’m 5’2 and 130lbs, a medium was too small for me. the material is also pretty thin. i don’t recommend it"
2.0,"Style - 5/5<br />Durability of the lining 0/5<br />I literally had to hand-sew the lining seems as they ripped within 5 minutes of putting it on the first time. Of course, since the material is terrible, those ripped through too. It's a shame, because I got a lot of compliments on the style."
2.0,"Bought 4 pairs, and they only lasted 5 months.<br />You can wear then approx. 20 time before they’re hoes heels in the toes and heals.<br />They were comfortable during the short period that they lasted."
2.0,"I am allergic to everything except 14kt gold, or surgical grade titanium. I bought these because they said they were full titanium. I figured I could move the clasp so it wouldn't touch my skin as I saw reviews that mentioned the clasp wasn't pure. Well none of it is pure. It doesn't matter what part of the earring touches my skin/is in my piercing, because I'm allergic to the whole thing. It caused a huge infection too, and my ears have been pierced and healed up for years. This was a total waste of money in my opinion. But they're cute if you don't have any sensitivities I guess. And they seem to be sturdy. So that's why I gave it two stars instead of one."
2.0,HAD TO SEND IT BACK .REALLY CUTE ASIAN SIZING
2.0,Pic shows brass/gold hardware but it's not. It's pewter silver/black. Dissappointed because I wanted what was described not what they sent. Another buying already said the same thing but I didn't see it until now.
2.0,"The good: the tie is a good length. Not too short. Not the best quality but not bad, especially for the price. The bad: the color is quite garish. It’s more obnoxiously reddish orange in person. Very very bright."
2.0,Item is too small for my son so I ordered a bigger one and give the small to a friend son
2.0,"The material and outer appearance of this item was great.  However, the material gave no wiggle room.  Us curvy pudgeeters need a little space.  But nevertheless, the material was of great quality, and design pretty."
2.0,Used it on my Napa leather jacket to clean and condition but didn’t see much results
2.0,Definitely not xxl  I’d say lucky you could call them a large. I got xxl from hospital and they cover my ankle. These  hardly cover my heel. Poor quality they are very thin. Would not recommend
2.0,More like basketball shorts-not light weight running shorts
2.0,"Definitely not for every day use. These would be fine for a costume, but they are as cheap as novelty sunglasses and have the plastic look of a happy meal toy."
2.0,Wouldn’t stay up on my daughters knees. They continuously fell and I had to keep fixing them  every few minutes. I finally gave up on them and ended up cutting some of her old legging and that worked great
2.0,After you wear it a couple times it stretches out... NEVER to go back to fitting properly and falls down off face.. EVEN AFTER WASHING. Very pretty but poor quality.
2.0,"Well first off, it's too shiny. It could look a little better. It's about 8"" long, the average woman (including myself) wears a 7"" to 7 1/2. I'm gonna give it to my granddaughter (she's 11), and purchase another one else where. Thank you anyway."
2.0,"relatively large coat and pants, hat so small it barely fit the 5 year old, and the beard was cheap and the elastic too small to even fit around the kid's head."
2.0,The material was my problem. It was not Jean but more of a silky material.
2.0,Cant get past my elbow
2.0,"Unfortunately, these will not work for what I need and I will likely need to return them.  They look MUCH different than the photos and are tiny little pieces, all under an inch.  Based on the info on the sale page, I thought I would be getting an assortment of sizes ranging from 1 inch to 2.5 inches, but the ones I got are all very small.  I wanted them for wire-wrap jewelry, but these are too small. Trying to figure out if I have another use for them.  Also, the stones are covered in a weird sticky/oily film!  No idea what that is."
2.0,Great concept but does not stay securely to phone case.
2.0,Love the quality however very tight.
2.0,"I was looking forward to wearing this hat. Its beautiful, well made & very warm. I was disappointed that the hat is the size of a child’s head. I didn’t attempt to try it on because if it did fit my head it would be too tight & would cause headaches. The opening is also too small for thick hair.<br />I hope the  makers make these hats in more sizes & a wider opening for the ponytail, & also make them without the opening for ponytail. I was looking forward to buying this hat in several colors.  So disappointed! My friend is happy though, she has a small head so I gave it to her. She says the hat is very warm , like I knew it would be, & she loves the lilac color I ordered"
2.0,"Not crazy about the way it looks, makes the watch look cheap, the leather bands are much nicer"
2.0,It was a nice belt but broke after two days.
2.0,It’s really pretty and seems well made but it’s huge and I went by the size chart ?? Lame
2.0,May have been cute but hard to say as their sizing suggestions are WAY off.  The description suggested that I get an XXL when I’m normally a size 6... strange.
2.0,No me agrada que una de las caras sea lisa: eso se ve cuando se usan y queda mal. En la foto no se observa
2.0,Looks cheap and cut small.
2.0,"My son was ecstatic to get these slippers for Christmas and wore them all the time around the house. However, as you can see from the pictures, they didn't even last a week before the side started to rip. My son and I are very disappointed in this products quality.  If you're looking for a pair of good slippers as a gift or for yourself, keep looking."
2.0,The hem got messy after the first wash and it continued to stretch out each time I wore it.
2.0,Very very thigh around arms and shoulders and I sized up 2 sizes.
2.0,Seams let loose in waistline after 2 washes
2.0,The dress is short and the material is see through. I like the dress but cannot wear because of the material.
2.0,Clasp came broken. I usually love stainless steel but not this.
2.0,Runs waaaay to small...
2.0,Took a long time to get here. No refund for this order
2.0,Couldn’t focus or adjust my eyes looking near or far.  Gave it a few hours trying to see if giving time would help but I got a bad headaches. Design looked very awesome and material and quality was superb . I just wish it would had work for me.
2.0,"At first glance it looks great, but if you actually look at it closely you will see otherwise.<br />this is pretty much a ""3D"" plastic covered sticker on a thin piece of aluminum.<br />i would much rather it be a twice as thick piece of steel with the graphic under a layer of plastic in a ravine in the dogtag.<br />defiantly not worth $10 i think, but it does look cool."
2.0,"S'ppose you get what you pay for.  The fabric feels like a gunny sack and the fit is way off.  I am usually between a medium and a large for tops.  Because the reviews stated that they run small, I ordered an extra large.  And even the extra large was wayyyy too tight on me.  The only reason why I haven't returned it is due to my inertia and forgetfulness....."
2.0,"the size is gigantic, can it be adjusted. I wore it yesterday and was pleased but, way too large"
2.0,2 out of 12 blue ones worked
2.0,This is a nifty item but it does not even come close to reliable readings. If it worked it would be great. But it doesn't so it gets returned.
2.0,"not 925 sterling silver.  It may have been plated, but the shiny coating has worn off and when I let it sit for a while, it started rusting - OVER THE 925 STAMP.  I haven't used the chain but I do suspect it may be real silver.  I gave this two starts because it is very cute and because it lasted six months of almost constant wear."
2.0,They are just ok not as colorful as they show in the picture. They are very light however so they won’t pull on your ears
2.0,Sleeves are small. Not what I expected
2.0,"I wear between a 4-6 and am curvy (big hips and a small waist). I thought that this would be super flattering but it is not. It appears to be well made and it is crazy soft but it really looks bad. It seems big but I feel like if I had ordered a bigger size, it might have been better? The bottom is very heavy and the pockets are great but the top is too tight across the arms. Sorry, this one is just not a good fit and instead of being flattering, it makes my hips seem much larger and my top out of proportion."
2.0,This is more of like a hoodie than a coat or jacket. Really disappointed!
2.0,Was very dissapointed the white shirt was yellow discolored where the cardboard was under it. Unable to get the discolor out!!
2.0,Started to ripe at the seams. Had just over a year and it’s coming apart.  Very sad I loved the wallet.
2.0,Way too big for toddlers
2.0,This is more like a tunic. Hit me above the knee.
2.0,"These Dollar Tree quality hats are VERY small- only suitable for babies and small toddlers.<br />If you want a quality hat, go with Sunday Afternoons- they're well worth the money and have a guarantee to back them up!"
2.0,Great looking shirt but it runs very small.
2.0,Super flimsy which made getting to mold to ear easy but also disfigures fast. Additionally I’m seeing discoloring already and have them less than a month.
2.0,Too heavy!
2.0,OK so I received my coat today and it’s a really really nice coat but since it came from China I ordered an extra large I normally wear a medium I am a D cupBut an extra large should have Surely fit But it’s too tight if you’re a small I suggest the extra large because there’s nothing in between that will work very disappointed
2.0,I ordered a medium as I usually wear a medium or a large in dresses but this was huge. I would need an extra small. I’m 5’3 and a size 6
2.0,Cute...but they fall/roll down within seconds of putting on...
2.0,Very cute at first until the stones started falling out.
2.0,Earrings broke the 1st day but I was able to fix them
2.0,"The glasses tint everything green, making it hard for the little ones to see. If my daughter won't wear it, what good does it do?"
2.0,seams split after one use
2.0,Love this top BUT it’s very short with big boobs. I’m keeping it for a date night look and maybe pair it with a denim jacket for a little more coverage.
2.0,Did not adhere well at all
2.0,"I was super excited about getting these!! Well....i got them. Sadly,I'm disappointed.  They claim to be 40&quot; inseam. They're more like 33&quot;. I'm 5'7&quot; and a 35&quot; is my preference.  So,I would gladly take 40&quot;!.<br />They're too short. As far as the &quot;bell bottom&quot;, they're more of a slight flare. This is the FIRST and last time I order jeans online. Lesson learned :("
2.0,"The product looks very nice but quality appears to be an issue, after one washing a hole appeared in one sock and the weaving on the inside appears to be unravelling the vendor is sending me replacements so maybe e will do better with those,"
2.0,This is not a card holder. This is a cigarette holder he is re-marketing. I would not mind if it were not for the fact it is very hard to get the cards out and they often get bent corners.
2.0,Just received these glasses today. Now I know these are cheap sunglasses and I didn't expect much quality wise but 2 pairs (out of 4) came straight out of the packaging with frames so twisted you can't even wear them. I would not have purchased them if I had known they would send me only 2 pairs that you can actually wear. Very disappointed because they do look good.
2.0,"Received with no problems, but 1/2 the items in the kit are tarnished.  Same issue with the rest of the order.  Very disappointed."
2.0,My daughter broke it the 2nd or 3rd time she wore it
2.0,"They were not all hypoallergenic, and ate at my ears good for disposable earrings"
2.0,"This costume was a little small and I didn’t have time to replace it, so I had to do a return and get another one! But if you can get one that fits, the same company makes an adorable Alice and Mad Hatter!"
2.0,"Very small ,"
2.0,Aguantaron el viaje pero al dezarmarlos un se despegó el cierre y se daño
2.0,Too small and too short. Bummer cause it's a beautiful dress. I'm a size 16. 5'11&#34; and the 3XL didn't fit.
2.0,Too small and very thin material. Will end up wearing as a cute cover. Ordered a large and even for my daughter size 6 does not wrap enough to wear alone. Not enough material to comfortably cover the split.
2.0,"I bought 5 of these tops, different colors.  When you wash them the stitching around the neck and hem unraveled.  I wouldn’t buy anything else from this company - Allegra K"
2.0,I was planning on wearing these with shirts that are tight but that I don't want straps or a back however they make my small perky boobs look saggy and very unflattering. I am going to just stick to wearing nipple covers.
2.0,I thought this would be a little thicker.  It's okay for the beach but it's a cheap material and totally see through.  Won't buy any more.
2.0,"Wanted to wear this for a particular outfit, but even in the XL it fit more like a medium. Had to return it."
2.0,I was hoping for a larger frame as in more like a ray ban frame style ( think nerdy fifties).  The image is misleading as the frames are much narrower then they appear.  Everything else about them is great.  I was just hoping for a more nerdy looking frame.
2.0,Not what I expected. The fit is fine but you can't tell the front of the shirt from the back. Thin sweatshirt. Good to just wear around the house
2.0,No fue lo q ordené. Me llegó un mahon c un estampado que no es de mi completo agrado porque limita su uso. No es feo... simplemente no era lo que esperaba.
2.0,Pins came out after a week. Very shoddy craftsmanship.
2.0,"These are all right. There really cute and all and can go for any occasion, but the backing is very week and it's a bit cheep feeling too. It doesn't look to cheep when wearing them if you dress proper for them lol."
2.0,"I was expecting it to fit like the picture, but unfortunatly it doesn't. I got the extra large and it is way too tight on me. It is also very uncomfortable. I have been looking for something to help with my posture and so far, I haven't found anything."
2.0,Its so puffy it looks like a chef hat lol if thats what your going for its great but ummmm yeah not what I was going for
2.0,Cute while they lasted. Broke easily & fast. Worn only by an adult & broke 3 within a week.
2.0,"I only wore it twice and the rose broke, if the chain broke I could have fixed it. But the charm itself just broke in half."
2.0,The shirt shrank 2 sizes after the first wash even after following the recommended washing instructions.
2.0,"Cute little charms for key chains. It does look a bit silly for how small it is compared to the ring it comes on however that it is exactly as pictured. Had to give it a few less stars because it fell off recently and I lost it. I’ve had keychains on my keys since high school, 5 years ago, that are still on there and this one came off within a year. Not sure if the ring I got just wasn’t great or what but a little sad"
2.0,Sizing was just off - gaped oddly at the neck line.  Fabric was not was expected.  Stuck together - washed and hung to dry  - put in dryer for a few minutes with fabric softener sheet...... still stuck together
2.0,Tiene buena tela pero talla muy pequeño
2.0,Too short in the torso. Looks longer in the pictures.
2.0,would not recommend to anyone. runs small and the scrunch isn't as profound as in the pictures advertised.
2.0,"It isn't linen, its polyester but the print is beautiful."
2.0,Very cute - BUT not what I ordered. I ordered a non-dangle solid stud but ended up getting a dangle one. Took the dangley part off and just wear it like that.
2.0,I received this item and it appears to be a very dark blue and not black. This item also does not fit according to the size chart. I cannot close or button this vest.
2.0,Super cute but one fell out w/o me noticing so they only lasted a few hours after receiving them😢
2.0,"First I would like to say the material is very good quality. Very thick and lined, especially under the sequence arms. As it would be very itchy otherwise. The only thing is, it’s not make for true plus size! It’s too tight under the arms, across the chest. So tight around the under bust that it makes you look pregnant. If you have big boobs forget about it Cause they will be spilling out. There is no stretch to this anywhere. If you are tall and slim this dress will look amazing. Oh and if you need to return get ready third party seller so getting a return shipping slip takes for ever. It’s like I already paid extra for the shipping. Now I have to pay to ship it back, I will not buy from third party sellers anymore it’s too much of a hassle!"
2.0,It's was really shorter that I expected
2.0,Go black after a few wear
2.0,It fit fine. The material was very thin and see through in the light. It was cheaply made with only one layer of material. Not what I expected from the pictures.
2.0,Lenses are ok but one of them happens to be smaller than the other product will have to do....
2.0,"It's so scratchy on the inside I need to wear a long sleeve shirt under it. Pretty light weight, very nice stitching"
2.0,This is such an ill fitting shirt. The neckline is weird. It sticks up in the air so you have to constantly pull it back down.  I bought a similar shirt made by another company and loved it. I don't love this shirt.
2.0,It's too big than I expected and it does not take all my Cards.  So for me it's useless
2.0,Way too tight against body and sleeves.
2.0,"I actually do like this but the second time I attempted wearing it the collar peeled off like a sheet of perforated paper. It was very strange, I didn't even pull it or anything, it just came apart as I put it on. I suppose I could sew it back on but I'm far from a seamstress so I'm sure it will look like I sewed it back on. Too late to return it, so I'll figure something out."
2.0,Beautiful bracelet but the fact that u are using an animals skin that belonged to an animal that had to suffer for his skin to be used as leather to represent another animal made me not like it. I wish you used polyurethane for the band instead of an animal skin of an animal that wanted to live.
2.0,"The shirt runs narrow through the body which is fine for me but won't work for someone who is overweight.<br />No problems with color or material<br />After several washings, a lot of shrinkage.  Buy one size bigger than normal or two if you have long arms"
2.0,It does not fit or it does not look like it appears on the advertised
2.0,I bought the lg/xl and I wear a 10 1/2 in mens shoes.  the socks are way to tight and fall at least 3&#34; below the knee.  Sizing is way off because I have bought other lg/xl compression hose and have no problems with fit.
2.0,"If they’re going to make it so small they should have a larger option, I can wear that mask for a couple minutes maybe!"
2.0,Fabric is nice weight and top style fits well. HOWEVER there is a seam that goes across right at the widest part of thighs that is extremely unflattering.
2.0,I was expecting them to be much larger
2.0,It fits weird. These clothes always look better on the website.
2.0,There were no 'stays' to keep the mask away from my nose or mouth.  Not a good mask for singing
2.0,"I sent them back, so cute but didn't like how they fit and they really smelled!!"
2.0,I am a female with pretty small head. This hat was reaaaallly snug. I was incredibly bummed at how tight it was for a men's size. :/
2.0,very thin and much larger than expected
2.0,"Massive gapping under the arms. A simple dart would not fix this. If taken in the lines on the cut are all wrong. The material is thin and the lining only comes halfway sudden your chest, so you can see the layers and it puckers over your chest."
2.0,"I initially bought  4 of these shirts, I gave away 2 for being too small. I just bought 2 more recently  and again one of the shirt is too small. At this rate I have paid twice the amount for three shirts I can actually wear.."
2.0,"Shirt is ok, nothing special material wise that I can’t get a local Big Box Store. Runs really large so get one or two sizes smaller than usual  One size smaller for a looser fit and 2 for a fitted fit."
2.0,"This pants are not my taste. They are really billowy, lots of material. Baggy and not fitted in the right places. Very high wasted. Thin material."
2.0,The mask is more of a cute novelty item that a true health aid. The mask is only one ply and if you hold it up to the light you can clearly see how thin it is.
2.0,Not impressed with the quality
2.0,"I originally ordered this product because it was on prime. I ordered a size large. First of all, the armor cuffs are the color of American cheese and very flimsy, they bent during shipping. Second, it is very hard to sit in !! It practically chokes you with just the outfit on, let along the other two neck add ona."
2.0,"The cut on these is weird...super baggy waistband but very tight in the front waist. These are reflective, and no one will call you out on them, but these are not the same as you would get at clothing and sales. Buyer beware."
2.0,The size is totally off. Way smaller then what was ordered.  Very cute and we'll made but it took so long to get them that now I don't have time to return and wait for another pair.
2.0,Too small for my adult size head.
2.0,"The dress is more like a swimsuit cover , extremely thin ."
2.0,"Very pretty necklace, but chain broke first time putting it on..."
2.0,This was very thin plastic and smelled like chemicals!
2.0,Nice fabric and looked cute. Definitely not true to size. I wear an xl and I bought this in a xxl just in case and I could barely get my arms in it.
2.0,Thin and big.
2.0,Looked beautiful online but such a disappointment.
2.0,This design stretched so much the black turned white and the pattern was unrecognizable. I really like these but I would recommend these for  15in around calves.
2.0,"Looking to combine it with hnos light gray shoes but the gray color is a bit greenish so it did not work, hence in fiwra is a good hat for ages 4 and up."
2.0,"I ordered this dress (size 6) based on my measurements.  I'm 5'2, curvy build with DD bra size. The dress didn't fit over my breasts. If you are a busty woman, this dress probably won't work for you. If I ordered a size up it would be far too large in other areas of the dress. The dress in and of itself is really pretty, nice embroidery and decently made, just not the right cut for my body type."
2.0,This shirt is very thin and arrived with a hole in the side.
2.0,"Let me start out by saying I LOVE this dress - the fit is amazing and beautiful and it is flattering on probably most body types.<br /><br />I was hugely disappointed after washing this dress. I washed it on delicate, by itself, in cold water. Came out of the wash okay and hung to dry. After a few hours - the purple from the bottom tier had bled about two inches up into the white layer. Tried to 'stain remove' but that didn't work. Can't bleach the white because that will ruin the rest of the dress.<br />Such a bummer because its such a cute dress"
2.0,"So I bought this hoop and it’s really pretty... However, I’m confused how it’s supposed to be worn! It doesn’t look right with the stud up close to your nostril because it leaves the gap outward. Others like this just have a flat stop on them and are worn by inserting from the inside of your nose piercing for a solid hoop appearance."
2.0,The color is very nice. The upper part is not adjustable which is a problem as swimsuits tend to loosen with time and use. The lower part is a Brazilian style which I didn’t know. Had to return.
2.0,"Very Disappointed. Nothing like pictured. As other reviews state, you can't see any color in the stones other then the blue bigger stone."
2.0,"Order arrived promptly.  It is .5mm, not 1.5.  The color is good, and it is clearly stamped 585.  But it resembles the hair-thin quality of freebie chains included with charms or pendants.  I'm keeping it for versatility's sake, as 14-inch chains are very hard to find.  But future buyers should be aware that it is probably only worthwhile as a child's chain with a charm that won't be missed if lost, or if a very careful adult uses it as a choker chain for floating charms designed for near-invisible chains.  Disappointed."
2.0,This fabric is completely sheer and see through. I was a bit disappointed with that. So paper thin I don't think it will hold up well. Not worth the price.
2.0,"the highly flexible frame allows the lenses to pop out, landing on the ground or floor."
2.0,These are light weight but too silky.  The slip off your face.  Would not buy again.  Wasted my money
2.0,"Poor quality. Washed and dried to get wrinkles out, the seam where button is shriveled up and haven’t even work yet. Not satisfied"
2.0,"So the dress that came is not the dress I ordered. No time to send back, but luckily the dress that was sent fits and looks ok on. Husband likes but not the dress that was ordered besides the color. Good material"
2.0,"Material is way too thin, every line of my underwear is visible underneath, the gray pair shows the color of my underwear clearly. The navy conceals the color at least, but the lines are apparent.  And the waist is super high. Not impressed at all. All I was looking for with sleep shorts to wear under long sleep tees and because of the high waist they don’t even look good under those."
2.0,"I'm pretty disappointed in these socks.  They ripped above the ankle the first three hours using them.  I'm a size 11 men's and the large fit snugly, but felt good and comfortable.  There is good cushion on the bottom but where the cushion meets the breathable lightweight fabric at the base of the ankle is where it ripped.  This is my first pair of phD socks and I'll be sticking with my darn tough hikers for the lifetime guarantee (plus no holes ON THE FIRST DAY!)."
2.0,"The suit runs large, had I known would have ordered a size smaller, there was no order form inside to return for proper size, nothing but the suot, not even a &#34;Thank you for shopping with us, therefore I will not place another clothing order"
2.0,The bottom half is ok but the top doesn't cover the breasts and keeps slipping off.
2.0,Okay with price you pay for
2.0,Had for maybe a week before the lighted strip came apart. Very disappointed as was my son since these were his favorite shoes.
2.0,"The socks are just too tight, making them uncomfortable 🥵. However the colors are very pretty!"
2.0,"I bought this for my wife because, well, she looks incredibly sexy in these sort of things.  Some of the reviews lead me to believe it would fit her just fine since she's about a D and at the time, the listing only had one size available.  I ordered the default size and when it came it was WAY to small for her.  We ended up giving it to her friend who it fit just fine (maybe a B cup?), but the listing was pretty vague with the size available."
2.0,Not strong. Broke easily
2.0,Bought the same cardigan from the same seller in black and the black one was fine. The white one was too small...?
2.0,The material is bad  ot for the gym at all!! Not worth the money
2.0,"Product was as advertised.  The biggest issues with not being flip up sunglasses is cleaning.  To clean the lenses of either the Rx glasses or sunglass is that you must take off the sunglass off the glasses in order to clean which is inconvenient.  The other issues was that the nose bracket from lens to lens has rivets in bracket to lens for attaching.  It is initially covered with a piece of adhesive paper to protect the rivet from possible scratching the lens of the Rx glasses during removal or installation.  Since I am assuming the cheap adhesive paper will not last very long, you would need to replace it with a dab of silicon for protection."
2.0,I usually wear 71/4 size hat but this particular brand of hat was way too oversized
2.0,The zippers broke quickly on this bag.  Would not purchase this again.
2.0,Earrings came in missing back pieces and a couple broken off completely. Cute looking but very cheap.
2.0,"It looks like it was screen printed by an amateur in their bedroom. It’s OK to buy it, just have a low expectations."
2.0,The green color does not match the green in the picture. It is much lighter like a mint green.
2.0,"These should NOT be labeled as compression tops. They are nothing more than thin polyester tank tops - athletic style, but that's all. There is absolutely 0% support/compression in the material, so if you're looking for something that helps tuck in and flatten/smooth any love handles; or keep your curvy chest in check while vigorously exercising (as compression tops are SUPPOSED to do) you're going to be seriously disappointed. I am debating whether to keep my set for cycling, and kayaking because there's not a lot of bouncing in those sports and these shirts will make a fine moisture wicking base layer. Be warned if you're doing anything that requires a lot of jumping, bouncing, etc. where you need actual compression clothing, these shirts are not for you. The inside tags have NO information on them other than size, so you have to know how to wash and care for polyester clothing. If you're a busty girl (bigger than a 34 C cup) you're going to have a problem where the shirt is likely going to be too short for comfort. This happens because a lot of the material gets stretched over your bosom, leaving your mid drift with slim to nothing to cover it. The stitching on all three of my shirts looks pretty strong and tidy, so I'm hopeful these won't fall apart when washed. Size wise, I went with an XL and I am happy that I did. While I usually wear a medium to large in US clothing, XL on these shirts just barely fits comfortably."
2.0,Quite junky. I guess you get what you pay for. The stones fall off.
2.0,It's a very pretty dress . But is different than the one showed . I was expecting the one in the picture. Although I do love it. I'm a bit disappointed cause I was looking forward to the other one .
2.0,"Good quality belt,locks the pubes in it sometimes though😬😵,hardware leaves a bit much to be desired.Buckle snags on stuff and pops open.Needs a clasp to keep it locked.It snaps in place,but it pops apart easy."
2.0,"One of the lights were detached from the start. It being brand new, I should not have had to repair it. 🤷‍♀️"
2.0,Sizes wasn't listed so i just ordered hoping it would fit.its to small
2.0,They were not bad done the job for a quick fix. However the top doesn't stay on and it cuts your lip open sometimes from the plastic
2.0,"The pendant is beautiful, but the necklace broke, also the stones came out."
2.0,Cheap fabric that pills like crazy.
2.0,Very disappointed in the size of the earrings  I would send them back just not worth the effort
2.0,"I wanted this so badly for when I have to mask up! But the size is more fit for a large man with a beard, not any woman I know. You can’t see anything other than pray and no matter what I do I can’t seem to get it to fit me :("
2.0,"I collect pins and one of these broke when I tried to place it, the pin part of it is what broke, the others felt weak but they made it where they needed to be"
2.0,Very uncomfortable and digs into fingers around it. Returned
2.0,"disappointed, I bought 3 as gifts and they look like diaper bags"
2.0,They are bigger than they look
2.0,"This shirt looked great online, but I was not impressed.  The material is almost translucent and the sizing seems to run small also"
2.0,"Don't buy these, they are so small! I put them on my newborn's head as soon as we got home from the hospital and they were still too small. They leave a mark on her head. I contacted the seller and they were quick to send me new ones; however, they were identical to the first set I bought. So now I have two sets of headbands that are too small."
2.0,Very thin and cheap looking material. I feel like the seam will tear out when I wear it so I wore it only once and it's ready for donation.
2.0,"When the product arrived I expected the top to fit as well as another top I had purchased. When I opened the package I was very<br />surprised to see that the bottom of the top did not even reach my waist. I am 5'1&#34;, so it wasn't because I was too tall. The picture shows the top to fit over the hips, and as I am a size 22, that would have been perfect. Unfortunately, when they made this top, they used the same amount of material as a size 10. I love the material, I love the print. I just wish I could wear it."
2.0,Bought size medium - I wear size 9-9.5 shoe.  The socks fit but do not stay up.  They bunch up under my heel after wearing for an hour.
2.0,I’m surprised at the reviews on these sunglasses. They are so cheaply made.  I got them on sale and still feel I paid too much.
2.0,they were much bigger than I was hoping for and did not fit my daughter and very cheaply made. They fell apart right after I received them!
2.0,"I was very disappointed in these pants, I ordered burgundy and blue. The first thing was the large waist band with apx. 1/2” of elastic. These pants are more like something you would buy at a bargain basement clearance sale. The second thing was the placement and style of the pocket. I opened one package excited to try them on and would not wear these to the bowling alley. I want to return them."
2.0,It is not a good quality - I returned it
2.0,Don't like the Quality
2.0,I really like the hoodie but the smell is absolutely horrible.  Smells like it was wet in a warehouse  almost unbearable.
2.0,"I was expecting a cotton/gauzy top to wear on sticky hot days. Unfortunately, the fabric is a cheap feeling polyester that doesn’t breathe"
2.0,These are a slim cut. The XL as well. Great/soft material but even if you go up a size only good for an extremely slim child. Sadly purchased a LG then XL and both to snug.
2.0,The inside bottoms are already falling apart. Not happy.
2.0,"I ordered this inline for my grandson to give to my daughter for Mother's Day. It would be nice for a little girl. The stone is very very small. She liked it, but not big enough."
2.0,Ordered my normal size and they were huge!  Had to return them.
2.0,VERY pretty but you can see right through the dress in places where it stretches slightly (over bust and bottom) :(
2.0,I ordered one for my granddaughter who is 6. She is just between a size 13 and a size 1....so I ordered a size 1. It fits like a size 12. WAY SMALL. This company should adjust their size chart.
2.0,One if them has a broken second.hand and the stem on another one came completely out.
2.0,The picture did not look much like the dress. Not as vibrant of colors!
2.0,"I am returning it. It runs smaller than expected.<br />Pretty color, but the style was not flattering."
2.0,"I read all the comments about sizing and measured according to the sizing chart, and decided to get a large. I normally wear a small or medium. This dress ended up being HUGE on me. I'm large busted, which is part of the reason why I ordered a large, but the bust of this was still much too large. It also was cut oddly, and hit across my bust instead of under it. But the biggest complaint was length. Now, I'm only 5'1, but I still sometimes struggle finding dresses that hit at the knee. This dress hit at the ANKLE. Not flattering. I am returning it and might try a smaller size."
2.0,"The neck of the liner was sewn in practically to my collar bone.  I would've kept it if that wasn't the case.  Other than that color and length was perfect.  5' 3""  - 130 lbs, ordered a small."
2.0,fabric was good quality but front pleats are puffy and too big
2.0,"When I purchased this shirt, it was listed as ""runs small"", so I sized up.  Very disappointed.  It runs true to size, and if you are a normal medium woman, don't buy large.  I bought to wear in a golf tournament, so once it arrived 2 days before I was ready to leave, I tried it on and found it to be too big.  Even washing it didnt help.  Cute shirt, but too big is not good to wear golfing."
2.0,Couldn't even get it over my chest.
2.0,"Boxy fit.<br />Reminds me more of a grocery clerk smock than a blazer.<br />The color, while cute is much lighter. It's difficult to tell in pics, but it's a light pastel lilac.<br />Doesn't look polished or professional at all; and definitely not sexy like the advertised photo.<br /><br />Returning.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'7"", wear a 42DDD and between a 1X, 2X top."
2.0,Way too short. Appears to go past waist in photo. But cud be a crop top it’s that short
2.0,The socks look nice but I had a hole in the toe before the end of the first day
2.0,The colors were nice but the material is weird and the pockets made my hips look so wide
2.0,The pants are navy blue. I thought they looked black in the picture posted in the amazon listing. It was a surprise to me when I received them and saw they were navy.
2.0,"Pretty, but I expected them to be medium sized. These are small studs. I don’t wear earrings this small. I’ll give them away as a gift."
2.0,Just ok.  Material is pretty see through and not compressing anything.
2.0,"I loved these at first (I bought 2, one for each side). They were beautiful and just what I was looking for. Well 2 weeks since my wedding and the shine of them is completely gone. The texture of them picks up every little bit of dirt and it’s impossible  to get out. Mind you, I work a desk job so not like I’m getting my hands dirty. Only 2 weeks of wearing and I’m looking for new bands sadly."
2.0,"This dress isn't what it seems, its smaller than the stated size and the floral print is very grainy and over blown!"
2.0,"These glasses are too expensive for the quality of materials.<br /><br />Very cute and quite stylish. If I had gotten them for $10.00, I would be more satisfied."
2.0,"Bought a L and I felt like I was wearing a circus tent! It poofs out but not in an attractive way....just way too unflattering, plus the fabric is really unappealing too. Might be better for smaller sizes, I don't know. It fit me great along the waist but the overall form was just BLEH!"
2.0,"I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus, swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on.  They were quite snug.  I assumed (my first mistake) that they would stretch, and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen.  So off came the tags and I wore them out.<br /><br />Unfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp.  In particular, the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point.  Since I now had $140 of unreturnable shoe, I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section. This let the liner stretch slightly, but not enough.  Even in my older, thinner orthotics and trouser socks, the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time.  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area, because they are unusable for me in their current fit.<br /><br />Clark shoes run a bit small and narrow, in my experience, so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width.  This portion fit as expected.  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support, these shoes might work for you.  The rocker sole does help with mild toe arthritis; severe cases will want to look for a stiffer sole than these.<br /><br />TL;DR -- don't buy if you wear custom orthotics, don't buy if you pronate, don't believe they will stretch when you try them on."
2.0,"Thought I was buying a drifit polyester fabric, this is more like see through nylon. Super cheap and everything sticks(fibers) to it in the washer/dryer. Thought I was getting a good deal at $31, but not even worth $10. Super disappointed."
2.0,We didn't like the cut around the arms and after it was washed the texture of the shirt changed and wrinkled very easily.
2.0,"Nicely made with good control stitching but the size runs very very small and there's not much stretch.  I wear large in other shapers (spanx, whatever the generic dilliards brand is, etc) without issue, but I could not get this on.  I'd say order a larger than normal size and hope for the best."
2.0,"I ordered these for a friend of mine with a little girl on the way. I wanted a little extra something to add to her gift, so I loved the look and price of these. I ordered them well in advance of the due date knowing they'd take awhile to get here... which they did. BUT, after all that time, one arrived without an insole! SO infuriating! I SHOULD give them a 1 star, but at the price, it's probably worth the gamble. You get what you pay for though.  Beware."
2.0,"Read the fine print.  Instead of a good deal for a pair of eyelets, this is for one eyelet.  Double the price for a pair.  It'll cost you $3.01 to return the $9 eyelet........"
2.0,"Beautiful dress, reasonable price.  Size is not accurate for American bodies.  Size recommendation is normal size worn and even going up 2 sizes for safety sake is not very comfortable.  Under the arms is where it was very tight and the size change did not change that.  The original size ordered did not have enough fabric to cover your back.  The new size did fix that problem.  But no time to send back and choose another because shipping takes forever when you do normal.  My return was received by them on 9/15/22 and today is 10/1/22 and my card has still not been credited.  DO NOT RECOMMEND."
2.0,I don't think these are canvas lol. They are very very thin....you can see thru them lol
2.0,I got five mask instead of six.  the filter is small to cover your mouth and nose. Also the filter feels more like a paper so i feel like I’m getting no protection. Does it help if you are using to get cover from the cold.
2.0,Was smaller than I expected...not oversized at all.
2.0,My 8 year old love it. We bought for summer camp wore twice and strap broke. Unfortunately it was outside the return window. If you buy make sure to WEAR it because it may fall apart after a couple wears and you don't want to be out $$ on a defective product.
2.0,Love the style.  No change in shade in sunlight.  One lense already came out.  Sad face for this.
2.0,way to small for an average 5-6 year old. My son only weighs 48 lbs and still too tiny.
2.0,Very cheap looking once received.
2.0,"I always wear medium underpants...always! But these medium underdrawers were too tight in all the wrong places. I thought I was gonna split a seam and had underwear imprints on my waist after wearing them all day. I gave them to my son. My loss is his gain I suppose. (He likes them I think). My advice is, when ordering this brand, go up a size from what you normally wear."
2.0,Hampton series seems thinner than &#34;leather&#34; and buckle doesn't hold as well. Buckle twist and pulls off belt.
2.0,"This to did not look like the picture at all when worn. This should have easily looked great but it just wore so loosely at the waist. It fit perfectly up top but the waist line was to baggy. It looked like I was trying to hit something but since I'm fairly thin, it just draped... Lol. It looked awful on me."
2.0,This dress didn't fit according size chart.
2.0,"This suit is sexy and has a great material however, I normally wear a medium or large but decided with my bust XL would be best. I barely was able to get this suit on ! While it looks good, I could never wear this out."
2.0,I liked how fast I got them and that it was a pack of 2 but they are super thin so I can’t really wear them for anything but sleep and it feels like they’re going to wear very quickly.
2.0,Really cute dress but incredibly oversized (which I knew and wanted).  Even the small would have been way to oversized for me.  Also very thin material and see through.
2.0,"Color is great. Diameter is too small for use in a labret piercing. Spikes are very tiny and sharp. Irritating to piercing site. I was really looking forward to this, and was highly disappointed."
2.0,"This hat does not match the pictures. Pictures it comes off as an ashy, denim wash look and instead it’s solid grey!!!"
2.0,The tips are for lg fat fingers and the person using them has to have a perfect size liner or glove for them to fit over to make it even slightly possible for them to stay in place.
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these shirts, black and white. The black was a true medium, the white also says medium but it is 2 times as big as the black. So huge I had to return it. I really like them and would have kept the white shirt but it was way too big."
2.0,The rubber it's made of smells awful - no way my kid could wear it. I thought it was a hard plastic mask but it's soft rubber and was misshapen when I took it out of the package. Not sure how to get it in the right shape even if we could stand the smell.
2.0,Not What I Expected! Small and delicate. Not good for the child’s craft project they were planned for
2.0,Love the shirt just sad it's too big for me to wear!
2.0,"Super tight compression fabric on legs, nothing uplifting as described. Totally flattens your behind.  I have bird legs and ordered small, still restricting."
2.0,these were to hard to keep on the nose I gave them to my sister and she loves them so hey it wasn't a waste of money
2.0,Everytime I put one in it seems like it gets infected.<br />...🤷‍♀️
2.0,I like the glasses themselves but they were way too big for my face. They almost cover half my face so that's a bit disappointing because you can't tell from the pictures. But besides that they look nice. I wouldn't have bought them if I knew how big they were going to fit ...
2.0,Smaller than expected and cheap looking. The clasp on the back is clear rubber plastic.
2.0,"the web page indicated a waist of 40in to be a XXL so I ordered that size in a 36in inseam.... surprise , surprise! the waist measures 37in and the inseam is a whopping 38 in on the left and 37 in on the right! I am shocked that Amazon would even carry good from this factory. I paid $36.00 . My church was having a clothing drive so I donated them, yes I'll probably burn in hell.<br />Expecting a second pair ( i ordered two different styles from the same vendor , they were shipped separately) this Wednesday. If they are similar I will return for a refund!"
2.0,Just received this today. love the fit and the look but the fabric to me is more of a winter time heavy fabric living in Florida. Other rayon dresses I have are half the weight of this. Is it the spandex that adds the weight not sure still comfortable and for 12 bucks I'll be keeping it
2.0,Two of the stones on the pin were missing. I should have returned it. I was very disappointed.
2.0,The quality of the fabric and sizing was not as expected. The photos also did not match the color of the top. I retuned this item.
2.0,"These are adorable, unique clogs. I was disappointed that the size is too big for me, though I followed the size chart & recommeded size."
2.0,"Pants are huge, but the hat is too small."
2.0,Like- The color and soft fabric on the inside of glove<br />Dislike- The glove is stiff and sheds small pieces from the outside. Could be warmer. Fits smaller than actual size
2.0,Cute dress with accurate size. Fabric is very thin but worked well for Easter pictures. Wouldn’t wear out and about. Washed well and hung to air dry.
2.0,It broke like 3 weeks later
2.0,"Lenses scratched the first day i used them. I bought a second pair thinking they might be better but the same thing happened!  Great idea and solid frame, but way overpriced for the lense quality. Don't buy these, there are better options are out there."
2.0,Nice but sizing is way off!  Yes ordered a woman 10. I swear I got a men’s 13!  Look like Donald duck feet.  And now the price went up so I’m not even gonna buy my size.
2.0,"I love these sunglasses but after two months the white on both sides is begining to fade. There are light browninsh streaks on the sides and it will not come off. I'm guessing all these marks are from the sun, that seems like bad quality to me."
2.0,"Sorry, I don't like to give poor reviews, but looks cheaper than in the photo - not like a $30+ watch to me - maybe more like $8- 15. However, my son was satisfied w/ its looks the day he got it.  Until it broke on day two - the 2nd time he put it on."
2.0,I sent this back because the leather was stiff and the clasp was very flimsy.  I wanted to put an expensive locket on it and was very apprehensive that the clasp would give way and I would lose it.
2.0,"I’m 5’2’’ 144 lbs and the size 8 fit great.  It was just way to long.  Almost to my feet.  Plus I accidentally ordered light green bc the first picture is the Art Green color dress, you have to scroll to see the light green, my fault for not reading and just looking at the dress.  I returned."
2.0,Doesn’t look like picture. I wear a  xl but went up in size and the sleeves and length are short
2.0,"Spent a lot of time using this product to make sure it was done right, feet stayed dry for a couple hours then started letting water in as usual"
2.0,Even after reading lots of reviews and ordering a size up. Still like the print. But ordered red got the coral. Very thin!!
2.0,"Cute design, fabric way too thin to be used as a face covering. Maybe over another mask. I'll probably wear it as a headband"
2.0,This broke when I wore it the first time.
2.0,"They fell apart as I put them on my earring holder, I hadn't even worn them."
2.0,it was way too weirdly fitte. i thought it was a romper and it wasnt. the shorts material was rough. I would like to return.
2.0,"I made a point to order from the women/children because I have an exceptionally small face.  They were so big, my husband could wear them"
2.0,Not good quality. The pockets are bulky. The leggings themselves seem to get loose while wearing. My first day wearing them and they feel loose as if they were worn for years.
2.0,"The lens is hazy, especially under direct sunlight. Got it on Oct 24th and didn't use it much, other than 10 minutes drives. Unfortunately, when I used it for an 8 hour drive, it was extremely hazy when the sunlight is right in your face. Its too hazy and caused headache too. I was much better driving without it..<br />Two starts because, I can still use it for a short 10 minute drive. But, I wont be using it for any long drives."
2.0,"The ring is cute, but it broke already. Not very solid in material. Price is good."
2.0,Printing on shirt is very poor quality so is fabric
2.0,Fits very tight.
2.0,"Very odd sizing. While the material is a good quality, the skirt would easily fit a size 22 to 24 person. The skirt is absolutely huge, and it’s long enough for a 7 foot tall person to wear. The top however, by no means matches the bottom. I am a size 16 and I could barely get the top over my head. Since the material is of such nice quality, I am considering taking it to a tailor so that they could have it fit me, but it’s a Halloween costume so I’m sort of torn on doing that. I just wanted you to know that the top is significantly smaller than the skirt, so if you are indeed a woman who wears a size 18 to 20, your lady bits are not going to fit into this top!Once this company has your money they no longer care about you.<br />I requested a refund from the seller. While they approved my refund, they never sent me An address label to attach to my packages. I contacted Amazon and I still do not have an address label. I have $60 of my money tied up in this purchase. I guess I’m going to have to go right to my credit card company for a refund. Do not ever do business with this company."
2.0,"Very cheaply made, works as a rear view mirror decoration for me"
2.0,"I loved, loved these shoes.  They were perfect for my navy dress for my son's wedding. The toe strap was too tight though.  I ended up switching them out before the beginning of the reception."
2.0,This was cheap looking and the lace at the top was very &#34;worn-looking&#34;. I wasn't happy and sent it back immediately.
2.0,Cute but the bar is longer than the one I was originally pierced with.... I compared.  It sticks out of my nose frequently.
2.0,Something isn't quite right with these... they make my ears tender and swell up terribly within a few hours of putting them in. I've not had issues with other silicone tunnels before.
2.0,Fabric is weak within a few days it tore
2.0,"Cheap material, as expected, but even on the large adjustment snaps in back it sits on my head like a beanie. Not worth returning, I'll just give it to a kid with a smaller melon."
2.0,Can't see it outside.
2.0,Light and poorly made. Parts came off after 2 days
2.0,Hated the bottoms
2.0,"Decent leather, but stitching and glue is cheap - band strap snapped on first day of use"
2.0,"My toddler wore these around the house for a few hours after I let him try them on, and the white on the sides is already peeling off like crazy. Granted, he's two and isn't the most gentle on his shoes, but I'd still expect much better quality for the price. On the bright side, they're super lightweight and breathable, so they'd make good beach or garden shoes if you don't care about how they look."
2.0,"Continually throughout the day, the liners were slipping off my heels.  There is a band around the sock to try to help them stay on, but that didn't work.  Also, by the end of the day there was a hole in my big toe (I only wear an 8 so it was definitely not an issue of my feet being too big).  Just not a great buy."
2.0,"I was so excited for these, but I just couldn't keep them. They were a little small, but the size wasn't the issue. They were not opaque at all! I had a bandaid on my thigh, and you could see the complete outline and color of it. Maybe if you bought them quite large so they weren't pressed to your skin at all? Anyway, they were not for me. Cute smiley though!"
2.0,fits a little tightly and is not very flattering. returned.
2.0,"Bought this for my father who has peripheral circulation problems, night cramps, blood clots. Unfortunately, he was awake all night because these socks made his feet boiling hot! No cramps, but worse night's sleep. We live in Florida, so perhaps they are better suited to cooler climates.  Something to consider. Disappointed to learn this item is not eligible for returns.  Also worth considering!!<br />Will shop elsewhere for an alternative."
2.0,"Fits very small and is a very thin, low quality shirt"
2.0,"I liked the color, feel, and quality of this band, but not how wearily it secured to my wrist. Multiple times, it fell of my wrist just by brushing it against my side. Most times I was able to catch my watch, but eventually it lead to my watch falling to the concrete and breaking the screen. I would NOT recommend."
2.0,We ordered more he liked them so much!!
2.0,"The whole X-Temp/Cooling thing really means a sort of spandex material.  I can deal with that.  I wear rashguards to the gym here and there.  It's all good.<br /><br />But what I can't deal with is direct spandex and relative lack of breathing room for male genitalia.  Things have to expand and contract and have a little freedom.  These underwear deny that freedom and sort of just elastic everything down to one side, and not always in a comfortable way.  Then you find yourself grabbing at it all day, trying to get half comfortable.  That's never good.<br /><br />It's a sad morning when these are the only clean ones in the drawer...  :("
2.0,I followed the size chart and they were too small.
2.0,"I order this product in October and wore it on and off throughout the week. They are not good for that, they have already fade on the sides."
2.0,Ripped on the first wearing
2.0,"I have a bbl and finding jeans or pants alone is a challenge at times. Came across these because they look similar to Fashion Nova jeans. I bought the 2xl and they fit however left that gap in the back and hardly went all they way over my butt. The material isn't the best quality and they are very thin.<br /><br />Measurements<br />5'2 160lbs<br />32,26,46"
2.0,"Bought the small, it rotates on my wrist and the fitbit face is hitting on everything. I plan to see if I can find a way to shorten it. Looks great, but not working for me."
2.0,This body suit is ok for layering but it’s pretty see through. I also missed in the description when I purchased that it does not have snap buttons on the crotch.  So there’s no laying with this and going to the bathroom.
2.0,Wasn't crazy about this. Colors did not look like the picture and it just hung like a sack.
2.0,"So...how to explain. They fit my 5YO son great from the thighs down, but everything from there up was a disaster. He had a giant bubble butt but also a bubble front. I had to cut them and remove some fabric and sew them back before he would even wear them. The fabric, though, is great."
2.0,"these worked okay, comfortable, not too hot. but they ripped on the first use and I'm an athletic male with semi slender feet."
2.0,The city Jacksonville is missing the “j”
2.0,This is the most unflattering garment I’ve ever purchased! I’m so upset at the horrible shape and that the bottom looks nothing like the picture.... it just looks like a tent literally! Very upset and disappointed!!! I love the harem style jumpers!! Too bad this one wasn’t what it said!
2.0,"They are fun and look great unfortunately if you leave them until protected or oils from hand and face touch them, theyou seem to discolor or look cloudy. Can't clean it off without loosing some of the tint. What do ya want for 5 bucks? I probably won't buy again."
2.0,Too uncomfortable  and too short.
2.0,Cute but order a size up or 2. My daughter is 3 and is wearing 4T.
2.0,"These jeans aren't exactly as pictured when I opened the package. Firstly, they are not really a jean texture or quality. Second, they have little zipper slits on both outer ankles and lastly, the button isn't the best either. It will continually undo."
2.0,"I ordered another set, same size and it fit fine… this design runs BERY small"
2.0,Ordered a size up and it still didn’t fit
2.0,The stones are not properly set and look like they are ready to fall out sad even the rhinestone parts are terrible the idea was beautiful but not worth the money!
2.0,sleeves are too small and I don't have big arms! Not a quality material at all.
2.0,They're not see thru. Other than that thwyre pretty awful. I have short legs and they go a good 3 inches above my ankle.  I'm 5'4 125lbs and got a small. It fits ok either than being too short. The material is not soft or breathable. Other than being somewhat cute for the gym I'm not a fan.
2.0,fabric is so weak easy dashing
2.0,"This top is way to short. It is a crop top, so unless you are petite, want to wear it with something high waisted, or want to show your belly button, don’t buy."
2.0,Bought for a conference and received the wrong item. I was sent a pencil skirt which was not the look I was going for but had to make it work considering I was going out of town and didn’t have an alternate option. Thank God that one fit though the button on the side popped while I was climbing into my uber. Not very practical
2.0,"I like the way these wrap around the side of your head. They feel very secure but very cheap. It's made out of cheap fragile plastic, does not have that feel of an adult sunglass and the lens also feels fake. The only other thing I really like is that these sunglasses are the type that people can't see your eyes it's really mirror like if you will. Overall I would not but these again."
2.0,The back of the earrings kept sliding off.
2.0,Looks more like a child tshirt
2.0,"These sweaters did NOT ship with the NOVICA Story Card certifying quality & authenticity. Decent sweater but potentially inaccurate labeling on Amazon add. NOVICA very difficult to verify this all with. Makes me wonder if it is ""certified""."
2.0,I love the size of this bag. Only not feeling safe carrying it. The handles feel loke is will tear easy and its not a strong feel.
2.0,The shoes were cute but they were too large for me.  My toes were not covered very well - not a good look!  I returned them.
2.0,"Smooth fabric that held tightly for a while, then had to be continually adjusted to stay tight. Of course, I am an outdoorsy working person, so this thing put up with quite a bit of abuse. I switched away from this band to a solid plastic with holes throughout."
2.0,Shrunk after 2 washes. Hand wash might be best. Color faded.
2.0,Color is not as expected (Denim light blue and not dark)
2.0,"As soon as we got this dress out of the package, beads and rhinestones were falling off.  The halter neck was missing the hook, so we have no way to fasten it without sewing on a new hook.  Due to the padding and wire in the chest, it didn't fit my daughter right in that area.  She has a very small chest, so don't buy this unless the person who will be wearing it is fairly busty.  She normally wears a size 2 or 4.  We measured her and ordered a size 4 going by the sizing chart, but it would barely hook and zip in the back."
2.0,"Really poorly made! It feels so cheap. I never really used it because I didn’t trust that it will hold my stuff. The drawstring itself is SOO hard to close. Just tough for no reason. It’s also really, really small. Honestly - it’s a no from me. Just requested a refund! If you want a good drawstring, spend the few extra dollars on an Adidas."
2.0,"Nice size and weight, however they fall out easily and can easily get warped if not stored seperate from other jewelry. I lost one after wearing the earrings only twice."
2.0,perfect for a last minute dress
2.0,"Would it kill these nightgown manufacturers to add an inch or 2 in length to make these gowns just a tad longer? At 5”6 I’d LOVE to find a gown that actually hits me below the ankle bone. If I EVER find a gown that does, I’ll buy 10 of them. This gown hits me right above my ankle. It will do because I can’t find one longer, but 2 more inches would be heaven. I think I’ll find a seamstress & have a gown made because it’s just not possible to find one made these days that actually is as long as I’d like. Frustrating"
2.0,"Waist was at a weird place, a little too high. The elastic bunches a little weird and doesn’t lay flat. Skirt fabric was not what I expected. I would not have ordered if I knew it was going to be that type of knit."
2.0,"The photo on these jeans looked amazing (almost like it was pulled from Revolve or something), but the jeans in person were a disappointment. They certainly run really big - I’m normally a S (26 in jeans) and after reading the reviews I purchased an XS - I was still swimming in these. The front of them is baggy around the crotch area and I have to imagine they pinned them on the model in the photo cause her waist looks very small. I will say they were better quality than I expected from Amazon jeans, but clearly not as good as what you’d find in a department store. The button was definitely tight, but I was able to button them and it probably wouldn’t have stopped me from keeping them if they had fit correctly."
2.0,It is pretty and looks like the pic... BUT why would the one I received look just like the pic??!<br />I was hoping for an original and special.<br />Lots of the crackly stuff and blues.<br />The orange is ugly IMO.<br />Also... I know sterling and the weight is VERY light.<br /><br />I am returning but will def select another ring that has more blue (the orange is not nice).<br /><br />Runs a teeny bit small so order up
2.0,The shirt fits well. But it's super thin. I've worn it once and it's already falling apart.
2.0,Really liked the fit and child said they were comfortable but only 2 months into wearing them and the sole fell apart.
2.0,"Runs small, material very thick"
2.0,It's huge. I have other Obey M shirts that fit as expected and this one looks like a painting smock. The fabric quality is fine.
2.0,2 different colors but why are they 2 different materials? One is supposed to cotton and the other is a spandex/polyester material which to me is werid. All together 4sets and all completely diff. These outfit does run big. You definitely can order a size dwn.<br /><br />Philip wife -Nef
2.0,"Poorly designed pants... the padding is in the wrong place and the inseam is cut poorly so there is too much extra material in the crotch. Might as well just ride in jeans (not even kidding here) because the misplaced padding rubbed against my inner thighs and was super uncomfortable. Honestly it was worse than having no padding at all. I only rode 16 miles and my butt was killing me. The only reason it's a 2 star is because the actual materials seem like a decent quality. But still, save your money and get something better."
2.0,"I loved the fit an comfort of this shirt.  BUT, The glittery part of the design washed off in the first wash, ( washed inside out on cool delicate cycle) and where the design was white, is now a dingy off white.  I'll probably toss it as it looks pretty sad."
2.0,"Cute pandas. My daughter found these earmuffs uncomfortably heavy, so we returned them. The size is indeed as shown in the photo."
2.0,"Worked great while it was intact... I have lowering storage racks in my garage and had to buy this to crank them up and down. It broke while raising a load up, I used some pliers and bent it back, then it broke again and cracked beyond repair... poor build quality at the all important joints..."
2.0,"Fabric is not soft, very thick. Not for summer at all."
2.0,Fit very uncomfortable
2.0,"I'm always between a 8.5 and 9 and the size 9 in these were too short. Also, in person the sole was much more chunky, thick looking than I thought it appeared in the photos...and it looks pretty thick in the photos. The top of the sandal is cute."
2.0,It is pretty but very small for a 4xl. The bust area inserted pads move around. You get what you pay for. Cheap
2.0,Measure is not accurate!
2.0,The colors were great but the fit was too tight and my head is not very big
2.0,I own a real GG marmont belt bought this for my daughter.The one I received had gucci written on the G which just looks tacky and it’s not like what others have received judging by photos posted . I would not have purchased if I knew it would come with this logo on the buckle.The one on top Photo is the real one the one below silver is one received with the logo etched into the buckle.
2.0,It is too small needs to be sleeper.
2.0,The one that I receive don't have the muscle abs. In the picture you can see it has them.
2.0,"small, kind of looked like a kids watch."
2.0,Runs super small but does stretch but ended up tearing from stretching it.
2.0,"The pattern is screened on, rather then dyed on, so expect that to start to fall off after a few washes.<br />The stitching on the edges is already coming loose as well."
2.0,Cheap but very thin fabric that doesn’t stay on throughout the night. Needs to be like 3 times thicker.
2.0,"I love the design, obviously or I wouldn't have ordered it. The lack of adjustability on the ear loops and the lack of adjustability over the nose are a deduction. The big one is that the material is overbearing. It is just thick/heavy enough to cave towards the mouth which causes an even bigger breathing issue. Definitely not a mask to be worn for an extended period of time."
2.0,"I am 5'5"" and 125 lbs, and I purchased a small. The small was a good size for me, but the way it fit my body was quite unflattering. The ruching in the middle bunched in my midsection and hit above my natural waist on my ribs, which made me look larger than I really am. The hips also hit in a way where the fabric stuck out above my hips, making an odd shape. It's almost as if the dress was designed for a shorter torso than mine, which is odd because I already have a short torso. Overall, the material and construction was about right for the price, about maybe the quality of teen stores in the mall, though the style is more mature. Overall, it might look good on someone, but it did not look good on me, and I returned it."
2.0,It's filled with powder that's harsh on skin
2.0,the sleeves were short and i don't have long arms. LOL im only 5'2 but it is nice
2.0,"It lasted two days. It was wonderful when it worked! I loves the full, sturdy support. So sad :("
2.0,Too small!  Looks cheap as it cost.  Learned my lesson. You get what you pay for.  Would not recommend purchasing this product.
2.0,"This was a good quality shirt, but I have to wear and stretch it out to fit comfortably. I was disappointed on how tight an XXL is. XXL is usually a little loose on me, but this shirt is too tight. Buy a size up."
2.0,Another too small bra. The cups were TINY and the strap was so small I was not going to be able to get it even 1/2 way around my rib cage. If they fit I could have seen this being a really nice bra. I was pretty sad.
2.0,"speedy shipment! Ruffle part of socks do not keep sock up...for wife (reviewer).  I had to pull them up all day...haven't worn them since.  Otherwise, the sock, though thin is decent."
2.0,I had to return because they ran too small.
2.0,"Was pretty, but fell apart quickly."
2.0,"Looks great, fits ok on my 2004 Rubicon. Bullet point came off second day driving but goes right back on. I could glue it but it's not a big deal. If you want something sturdy I wouldn't recommend it."
2.0,"A lot bigger than I thought they would be. I got them as a gift for someone and due to the size they looked cheap, so didn't give the gift."
2.0,"I know this is advertised as a compression shirt, but there's ""compression"" and there's too small. I can deal with compression - the expectation being that the compression helps speed up muscles repair after exercising and reducing muscle fatigue. However, this falls into the ""too small"" to be comfortable category."
2.0,Too small and it’s not like what shown in the pictures. It’s just perfect size in the picture but when it arrived it’s too damn small. Can’t even fit my purse. The only thing it fit is a phone. Disappointed and will never recommend. I regret buying it. Also next time use the actual size on the pictures. 🤬
2.0,"These may be ok it you wear socks, but they are not soft and comfy in bare feet."
2.0,Looks cute and bendable to manipulate. Large
2.0,"I specifically needed nose studs, in the description it states that nose studs are included. Not one nose stud in the whole bag. I’m very disappointed."
2.0,Costume is really cute but the jacket is plastic and you can’t wear it for more than 5 minutes without complete sweating! Couldn’t wear the costume out and the hat is also extremely large and doesn’t fit at all.
2.0,"Love the picture of these earrings, but it’s not what I received.  I received tiny turquoise colored ones.  Sadly returned."
2.0,These were bought as friendship bracelets--but were poor quality. They were all broken and or coming apart within a week of wearing of them. Very cheaply made--would not purchase again.
2.0,Heavy shoe. Plastic uncomfortable straps. Returned without any hassle.
2.0,"I loved the colors , however the a suit was way too small and it was supposed to be a xxl"
2.0,Fits too tight!! Large normally does me comfortably and this is a booty poppin dress that I cannot wear when I'm full or I'll look pregnant!
2.0,"The end of the seam next to my left big toe is not smooth.  It is sticking out just a little, and when I xc-skied, it hurt my big toe.  It is only with the left sock, not the right, so this may not happen with every sock they sell.  I don't like the stickiness when I walk on the wood floor, but I see some people would find it safe not to slip.  The color is super cute.  Very comfortable fabric."
2.0,Its already tarnished
2.0,I got these for my husband for a Christmas present because he is diabetic and I knew they would improve circulation. There is just one problem. He couldn't even get them over his toes. They are way to small. I ended up wearing them.
2.0,The color is much more green than what is pictured.
2.0,"The dress was beautiful, however, was super short in length."
2.0,Had to return and get larger size. SO SMALL!
2.0,I have arthritis in both my hands and find it to difficult to remove credit cards if there are more than four cards in place.
2.0,Be aware the length is way to long and you should choose a waist size one up from your regular size. The biggest problem is you can’t choose your length and that is the reason I returned my pair.
2.0,I was disappointed with this product. They are nice and fuzzy but to not cling to my feet. They fit like a grandmas sweater that was knitted too big. O
2.0,"The dress was the fit that I wanted, but the color is not what I expected since it was more like a pale orange rather than the color I chose in the picture."
2.0,Much too big and so smooth and slippery that it would fall out of your pocket. I sent it back.
2.0,Tight under the arms and long in the sholder
2.0,I would size up two sizes. If you child is on the smaller shorter side then it should fit good. Cute dress and good material thou. My child is a tall skinny one and dresses can get too short on her. Wasn’t expecting that much skrinkage on first wash
2.0,I definitely should have read the reviews before I purchased. Not &#34;glitter&#34; like at all. Colorful blobs would be a more accurate statement.
2.0,VERY poor quality!! I should of listened to other reviews. The material is hard and rough.
2.0,"This is a large purse but it's deep, not wide, which makes it very difficult to find stuff.  I am currently looking for a purse without a narrow top.  This would be cool if I was in school and only had notes and books.  This purse is not for many small items."
2.0,The flair was too wide. Otjer than that beautiful
2.0,Was tighter than I was expecting. Needed to go to a size.
2.0,"I usually wear between a 30-32 depending on the brand and style of jeans. I have some American Eagle 33” skinny jeans, for example. So I went up to a 34” on these Genuine Assembly jeans because of the skinny fit and not knowing how the brand would fit me overall.<br /><br />My experiment was a bit too zealous. I don’t know if Genuine Assembly offers a 33”, but fortunately a belt is enough to keep the jeans up. I’d say these aren’t that skinny of a fit. At the same time, the jeans aren’t stretchy. At all.<br /><br />The tag says made in Bangladesh, from 98% cotton and 2% spandex.<br /><br />I don’t love the denim. It’s not that soft and has a smell even after washing. It’s not a bad smell, but it’s something I noticed when folding them. They’re just okay."
2.0,"I ordered a small. I am 5' 5&#34; and this dress was at least 6 inches above my knee. Totally not what I was looking for. The print was nice in person, but I am returning it."
2.0,"Super thin and quality is not great.  I've been so busy, I've not had a chance to return it."
2.0,Don't like size
2.0,"Returning this. I got a 12 (I'm 5'8, 160lbs) because I thought that would fit in the shoulders. Sadly, a size 12 fit great in the shoulder but was wayyyy too large in the torso - not even worth getting it tailored. I was swimming. Probably great for people with other body shapes though! It's only a single layer so it doesn't look like a fancy blazer, but is great for layering where you want something a step up from a cardigan. The pink color so gorgeous, I may try ordering it in a smaller size to see if that works."
2.0,Spins on your neck
2.0,Pretty much standard wax that offers very little to any protection against brake dust. Removed all 4 wheels on my Camaro and put two coats of wax on them. Within two days the wheels were covered in dust like usual and no easier to clean than without wax.
2.0,Looks more like a medium. The pink is not like shown more of a neon pink. The style is similar but not the one on tiktok. Still gets two stars because it’s still cute but was too tight for a large.
2.0,"My friend absolutely loved this hat, but was upset when the Sloth started to come off only a couple of days of wearing it. That's why I gave it two stars. I got it for her mainly for the sloth. The fabric was good and it was adjustable."
2.0,The Safety clips come apart with the slightest touch making it hard to wear around your neck without losing
2.0,The material is really Nice but it does not fit as expected.The shirt is oddly cut in the neckline is really tight when I looked at the model this shirt look like it had a wide door nec The shirt is oddly cut and the neckline is really tight when I looked at the model the shirt look like it had a A wider crewneck but when it came it was really tight around the neck and the sleeves are meant to be smaller but they were just cut oddly.
2.0,"Product was nice, but way too small.  I do not think sizes were properly listed."
2.0,"Thought this is it, but no it is not. Its hard to breath in this thing."
2.0,Dress is stretchy to the point of see through.  Made entirely too long
2.0,"Cute, but one of the bracelets broke after the 3rd day"
2.0,everyday use! They loose time. Battery? IDK but it shouldn't need one already
2.0,Not the best quality.  Make-up was a bit dried out and looked flakey on skin.
2.0,"I made the mistake of not reading carefully how big these earrings really are. If you like large earrings then these are for you! But I was surprised to find out they are nearly 2 inches in diameter. So, get your ruler out before you buy these."
2.0,I wasn't too happy with how it was sewn. The hips part was bulging and hou can see that it was not swen correctly or it was rushed.
2.0,The buckle is clunky and heavy.  It comes loose after several golf holes.
2.0,"It is not as shown in the picture unfortunately. It is very thin and short. I was disappointed on the arrival of my scarf since it looked very cute in the picture. But, it is still a pretty looking scarf. There's just not much you can do with it as far as styling (tying or wrapping around) the scarf. So, instead of returning it I may give it away to my niece :) She's small enough where it will come down a bit on her."
2.0,"It didn't look like the picture. Smaller than I expected. Still, a great pair of earrings cuz they are well-made."
2.0,Way too big! Kept it just for lounging around the house.
2.0,Not what I expected. Looks different in person
2.0,"The interior lining has frayed apart from the leather.The sewing is substandard.The credit cards are exposed.Very disappointing,cause its a great looking wallet.I usually do not complain,but it was a gift......,EMBARRASSING...."
2.0,BAD QUALITY!! DOESNT WORTH A PENNY!!! IF I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK I WOULD HAVE REQUESTED A REFUND!!
2.0,The size was incorrect.  This shirt runs extremely small.  The sleeves were long but the shirt was too small.  The material ws cheap.
2.0,This runs super small. My daughter is so tiny and it is so small on her.  It is very thin and cheaply made.
2.0,"I got this because it said it was ""100% fine wool"" and I liked the pretty embroidery. The embroidery is nice, but the material is a weird-feeling blend of 65% polyester, 30% cotton, 5% spandex. I almost looks like felt, but it feels slick. You can machine wash on cold, gentle cycle."
2.0,It's see through. I can see my bra through it
2.0,Decent material. Decent look. The cut is for someone who is in great shape.
2.0,"For tall people these pants are way too short. The crotch is also really awkwardly long. I had to buy them for work, but I will never wear them in public outside of the fitness center."
2.0,Super sad. I ordered a small and it fits more like a Large. The quality of the dress seems GREAT. But the sizing is way off. I'm five three and 110lbs. I didn't even have to unzip the dress to get it on. I just stepped into it....felt like I was a little girl playing dress up again. I was really super excited to wear this dress to Vegas :(
2.0,Runs small. Buy 2 sizes up if you want them to fit.
2.0,"This is the 3rd set of these types of panties that I brought. This set does not make me as happy as the first 2 sets from different sellers. The first 2 sets are very soft, fit nicely, and do not crawl up the butt. This set has a funny feel to the material, stretches along the bottom of the buttocks and hangs loose, and then crawls up the middle of the backside. Very uncomfortable. Will not buy from this seller again."
2.0,"Bought the 34 B was way to smaller gave it to my 16 year old daughter who is a skinny kid, they were nice but way too small"
2.0,"While the pants are cute, the seam was ripped below the zipper and the buttons will need to be taken off and sewed on stronger. One thing people do need to be aware of, the black pants are see through enough that I would suggest wearing underwear in the same color of the pants.  Guess I will have to pull out the sewing machine, disappointed in the quality of this particular pair of pants."
2.0,Not as well out together as expected.
2.0,Arms were a bit tight and material is quite thin
2.0,Must be careful and carry extra pair because they will break if you take a long trip
2.0,Too big for 32C even I chose the smallest one
2.0,"The design is great, but they closing mechanisms broke very soon."
2.0,nice swim suit runs small
2.0,"These socks were supposed to be unisex.  Five pairs came the same size, two look like they could fit doll feet, and one is big enough for ogre feet.  Not happy at all.  Only good thing i can say is they arrived on time."
2.0,the size chart is not in line with the product
2.0,"This ""watch"" worked for about 3 weeks and then the battery died and you can't open the back to change the battery properly. The metal color wears away in about 2 weeks."
2.0,Opened the package and the odor of the necklaces is so foul and strong it makes it impossible to wear. A very toxic chemical smell. I will wait to see if the smell fades. Otherwise the necklace seems okay but definitely couldn’t wear in day 1.
2.0,The shirt is very cute BUT I ordered a small and what came was HUGE! I’m returning it.
2.0,Sized smaller than size chart stated.
2.0,"Cute, seemed to be good quality, color was nice (gray) but you cant adjust the straps! Like, what?! I couldn't wear it. Sent it back."
2.0,Its more biege than white..i wanted white
2.0,Too small and the material is see thru
2.0,Chain broke with first wear and with very light use. Not sturdy or reliable at all.
2.0,Bracelet too big and no way to adjust... Made my own
2.0,"Too large, however, it's not as sturdy as I expected for helping babies learn how to work. I thought it would have supported the ankles more, so the shoes would help with children standing and walking."
2.0,"The picture on the model makes the yellow look more vibrant than in real life.  Interestingly, even my picture is a little off (looking better than in reality), though I put a highlighter as a point of reference.  In reality, the color is more like a mustard pukey yellow that would probably be unattractive on most people.  I was really hoping for something closer to a lemon yellow.<br /><br />The material is not the most comfortable, either, but passable enough that I will keep this as a rather expensive pajama top.<br /><br />The fit is rather frumpy (even more so after washing).  I would have also preferred a little wider cut in the neck or a moderately low cut v-neck,, which I think would have made it look less frumpy.<br /><br />The sleeve length is just right, though, and the cut is comfortable on the arms.  My arms are not skinny, so this last part is important to me.  I hate the sleeves that feel like tunicates.<br /><br />I like my tops slightly loose and I bought the medium size (what I usually get), which is just about right."
2.0,I ordered a large like normal and it was extremely small! It also was way too short and did not even come down to my waist line in the back. Was disappointed I couldn't wear for our family pictures.
2.0,Very comfortable.  Washed per instructions and both pair shrunk over 2 inches.
2.0,This shirt is very see through. I love that its light weight but I dont want to wear an additional shirt under this shirt to hid my goods come the hotter days. The fit was awkward as well. Returning.
2.0,I've lightly used this bag for one year. It hasn't held up very well.<br />The biggest complaint is with the snaps. One snap on the hand grip failed almost immediately. Over time the magnetic snaps failed losing the magnetic backing. The material has maintained its durability and the leather appears to be of good quality. The two stars are for the hardware failure.
2.0,The necklace is cute but the chain was very cheap and broke almost immediately.
2.0,"Cute design but straps broke after less than 10 wears. Disappointed, expected to last longer."
2.0,These are supposed to compress but they don't do that at all. I was disappointed when I tried them on.
2.0,Too smal cheap. Returned
2.0,Eehh... The earrings look better in the picture than in person. The crystals are minimal. And I definitely think that they're over priced.
2.0,"Ordered this lanyard for my daughter's mask to wear at school and didn't get the chance to use it, the latch was broken inside the original packaging."
2.0,"This is the second pair I purchase. First one was pink and my daughter broke it with in three days. The reason I purchased it again was because I assumed the frames were all the same and I planned to just put the lenses on this one and let her use them. Wrong, lenses didn’t fit the same. One side is much larger than the other. So now I’m stuck with frames that I can’t use and my daughter has no glasses to wear."
2.0,"I love the quality of the dress and it’s beautiful all around but I typically wear mediums and a small was way too big and it was also longer than I anticipated, longer than shown in pics. I’m 5’5 140lbs c/d cup bra sizes and the small was too large. Hoping this helps the next person, if there was an extra small it would have been perfect !"
2.0,Clasp doesn't work.  Very cheaply made.  Pinches skin.  Don't recommend.
2.0,The toe box is too narrow on the outside and my toes bump against the inside of the shoes. The next size would be too big. I will return them.
2.0,"I love the lens but the frame does not fit my face. It cuts into the sides of my nose after a few minutes of wearing it. Also, it did not come with microfiber cloth as advertised. I have sent this back and ordered from HSN the original HD sunglasses which I have used and loved them."
2.0,I missed the return window by a week or so. Unfortunately as I didn’t even need to wear the shirt till recently and the zipper failed right away and can’t get it to work. Not happy as the other few shirts In different colors works well in the sun and heat. So as far as working in sun and heat these shirts work.
2.0,"I love the style and color but had to adjust the chest area, the cut was too deep and baggy"
2.0,The look is great for the price. But the lenses are very cheap and flimsy. I’m not sure if there’s any UV protection. I’ve had the real Celine’s and there’s no comparison. You get what you pay for!
2.0,These shirts look good but just dont fit right
2.0,"It’s ok, but looks and feels like something much cheaper you could find around Halloween. The string broke and it fell apart before I had a chance to wear it."
2.0,Runs big. The material was a lot thinner than I thought. Sent it back. It wasn’t what I imagined it would be.
2.0,My daughter was very thoughtful and thought she ordered me a lovely gift. The outside of the amazon box was not damaged at all but the inside was wrapped in bubble paper and was smashed. It clearly had been sent with the contents already messed up. The quality of the items was so low it doesn't even qualify for a dollar store. I don't know if you can see from the picture but the necklace was like a gumball machine product. Even if this gift had not come damaged it would still have been an extremely poor quality gift for $49. Save your money and let your friends and relatives know not to order from this company.
2.0,"There are three models on this item's web page[[ASIN:B06XTCR54N KEEN Logan WP Wms]] for the same item but one of them is high ankle, other two are low ankle. I purchased high ankle one but it was delivered to me low ankle, so I returned the item. Please do not allow these kind of confusings and adjust this mistake."
2.0,Cute but to tight fit me
2.0,"Beautiful but gets soo tangly its so frustrating that i have to keep adjusting it, i wore it 3 times"
2.0,its a  little too big
2.0,It's not good quality the plastic ends come off all the time from the string I had to super glue every one of them very poor workmanship very unhappy
2.0,Gloves were too small for an 8 year old girl. There were also loose stings on the outside of the glove that would have caused unraveling if a child pulled on them.
2.0,Rough fabric and fits too tight
2.0,Used these as a key ring - FAIL.<br /><br />The ends pull off the cable WAYYY to easily. More for decoration than functional use.
2.0,These are not as nice as I had hoped they would be.
2.0,Order about 3 sizes larger or you'll be returnng it!
2.0,"These very very cheap. They covered 1/2 your face. If you wore these glassess and a mask, there would not be any face showing.The good. You could not see through them. I like to people watch, but I don't want anyone to see me looking. Outside nothing shady. These did work for that but they are huge and unstable on your face. Wish the ad would have shown them on someone's face. Every face is different, but it could have been an indication of the fit."
2.0,"Size down, item was HUGE"
2.0,"Save your money....it is MUCH prettier in the photo, it runs small and if I had seen it in a store, I never would have bought it."
2.0,"I was very displeased with this shirt. The good thing about this shirt is that it came in early, but its just like the medium I got last year, only a bigger size. The picture does not match what I got in the mail. Normally I would settle for this, but I'm tired of settling with what I get. I have too many shirts I thought I would grow into liking, but left unworn, and a waist of money. The stronger than all on the back of the shirt is not as big as what you see on the picture. Don't get ripped off. Take my advice... Don't waist your money!!"
2.0,This product came on time. Fit was a little big on my 15 month old. One snap around the legs was already together. And there was a hole where the half of the snap should have been. It works ok for one day
2.0,No me agrado el size. Parece que no elegí bien. Pensaba que me iba XL y realmente soy M. Estoy triste con mi elección. Amazon debiera tener un mejor método de perfil peso y medidas del cliente para comparar con los size de los vendedores.
2.0,I took a chance after reading other reviews and order this bracelet! It's true the skate is BLACK!!! I just opened the clasp and turned it around to the silver side. Also I must say it is a super tiny bracelet for someone under the age of 10? I made a shadow box and used it otherwise I would have sent it back!
2.0,fell apart shortly after receiving them
2.0,This belt I received is a much lighter brown than you see in the picture.
2.0,"I either got sent blue, by mistake,  or this thing just looks more blue than anything else. It is not what I expected visually. I kept it, only because it will go well with denim."
2.0,Coat looked and felt beautiful but on the second day of wear the zipper started getting stuck-my son was stuck in the coat and I had to pull it over his head to take it off-definitely unfortunate as the coat had seemed so perfect
2.0,"There is zero chance of this fitting anyone over the age of 8. It is SO tiny. The tardis charm is comparatively large- huge, even - and it is all silver, not blue.  Not at all what I was expecting. Maybe cute for a child."
2.0,the colors are pretty and they are lightweight but they are REALLY small. Much smaller than I had expected.  I'm not sure how I can use them but hope I can find a few uses. I'll probably give a few away. They are almost like toys.
2.0,Too loose .
2.0,This shirt is sized small and the fabric is hot for the summer months.
2.0,not much movement in the fabric either
2.0,Very thin and doesn’t stay closed
2.0,"item is much nicer in the photo than what was sent to me. colors are muted, not sharp like picture. scarf is very much shorter and rougher than expected. will keep due to very low cost; however, will never buy another one. Oh.............Nevermind"
2.0,"I purchased these in another size, not only was the color significantly different (not in a good way) but the buttons are also much smaller,  detail I liked about the other pair."
2.0,It says pierced but its just a clip on conch ring.
2.0,Very soft and light. Easy to breathe in. Just colors are more bright and not exactly the same like in photos. There is no beige mask. I want to share them with my husband but they are too small for men.
2.0,Wool is a bit thicker then I thought it would be. And a bit cheeky. I returned the product and opted for the more traditional bikini brief.<br />They are very well made!
2.0,tend to ride up and a bit uncomfortable
2.0,Run far too small. Unfortunately I didn’t realize it until I had washed them so could not return:/ Too bad bc they were cute
2.0,every thing is good
2.0,very pretty color but the quality of it was not to good at all
2.0,Really bad quality. The size label came on the outside. See pictures. I’m returning this right now
2.0,Not even close to sweatshirt material. Crap!
2.0,The earrings were not as colorful as shown. But they will do.
2.0,You really get what you pay for on this. The belt looks and fits nicely but the buckle could have a better design.
2.0,"Big, not a very good fit"
2.0,"I was excited it was offered in XL, but I wouldn't have ordered if I noticed this was made and shipped directly from China.  They use a different size chart that runs a lot smaller than if it were made in the USA.  I can also tell that when I do go to wear it, I doubt it will last through one washing.  Looks way much nicer in the picture.  So I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I have had acupressure sandals in the past but these were simply unwearable.  Upon examination, I discovered that the nodes has sharp, spiky tips, unlike the smooth nubs of the sandals I have had in the past.  Further, I purchased sandals marked for ladies sizr 8-9.  The sandals I received were size 47 metric which meant that they were men's sized."
2.0,Half of the straws arrived broken
2.0,"I love the length of the chain, but the gemstone looks like plastic and the chain is very costume-y."
2.0,"I loved wearing them, but it was only good for one time. :("
2.0,"I was disappointed in these.  I wore them t  by e first time with a disposable appliance for urinary in continent, which worked great. I only very small amount of leakage but the bad odor was there. The leakage was not contained in hyd pantries either"
2.0,"it's adorable at first and very soft - but after just a few wears it's starting to unravel. also, the ends of the tassels are not completely dyed so they look worn. Not impressed anymore."
2.0,What i got in the mail looked nothing like the picture. the one i did get was okay but the seams were falling apart.
2.0,"I bought these for my 14 month old. Arrived quickly and appeared to be in great shape. I took them out of the plastic bag and they reeked of gasoline. I vauguely remember reading one other review that complained of a gasoline smell. I figured I’d take my chances, but I guess I drew a short straw. My hands smelled like gasoline after holding them for a few brief seconds. I didn’t put them on my daughters feet. Will be returning these shoes. I would have given 1 star, but they’re super cute and look comfortable."
2.0,"Pros:<br />It arrived earlier than expected<br />The dress itself is cute<br /><br />Cons:<br />Literally the first time I put it on, one of the sleeve buttons popped off.<br />The polyester material looks cheap and clings (even with spanx)<br />Cheap dress is cheaply made, there were tons of thread sticking out along the back zipper.<br />If I could, I’d return this in a heartbeat. As for now, I’m stuck with a broken dress that is literally stinking up my closet with a chemical smell."
2.0,These are so small my 9 year old can wear them. Way to small unfortunately.
2.0,Disappointed with this purchase. The bags are very small and cheaply made.
2.0,Returned this - does not work for an XL
2.0,Avatar the product across it didn’t have enough compression.
2.0,Not really functional
2.0,This sock was good when it arrived. Within two uses it tore and has a hole (i do not have nails and the tear is in the bottom). Either I received a defective product or the quality of this product sucks.
2.0,"Material same as Fruit of the Loom, colors were not what I ordered"
2.0,"I had high hopes for these compression socks based on my good experience with other Copper Fit products.  I purchased the XL size which corresponds to my shoe size (11).  My legs are average size.  I found these socks to be a little difficult to get on and, due to the height and fabric, they caused skin irritation on the top of my calf near the knee joint.  I ended up returning them."
2.0,"Need to order large than average sizing.  I gave them to my wife, they are very soft."
2.0,"The material is nice but I think the sizing is off, and the fit is awkward."
2.0,"Not the best CD for a Halloween party  I wanted a CD that I could just leave on repeat for my Halloween party.  Only the first track had Halloween music, while the next 23 tracks were just spooky sound tracks.  It's kind of not that cool to play a 3 minute track of heartbeat sounds, and then an another track of footsteps, then doors slamming, etc. you get the picture."
2.0,"So tiny. They are great for a child's ears, but not good for adults...unless you have very thin/small lobes."
2.0,"As a produce manager, I wear a variety of pattered aprons to keep the customers smiling. This one gets em grinning! The photo is blurry up close and the fabric is cheap. It won’t launder well... but that’s ok; it matches my earrings 🌽"
2.0,I have to wear these everyday at work and they still fog up smhhh
2.0,"I liked this sunglass case.  It is a medium firmness case that is deep so capable of handling larger sunglasses.  I used the clip to clip it to the bag I bring to work every morning.  After short and even gentle use, the material that tied the clip to the glasses case simply came unraveled and finally broke.  I nearly lost my sunglasses as the case dangled feet away from the clip before I noticed what had happened.  As a result of that quality issue, I cannot recommend these sunglasses."
2.0,"Lame. As others said the scarf is one giant pocket. Not useful at all.<br />The reason I gave it two stars is because the scarf is still nice as a scarf. Relatively soft and solid.<br />So I can wear it as a scarf, but I have to put my whole arm inside if I want to put anything in there and try and get it out."
2.0,Very odd fit and material is a stretchy type of spandex. I got these for work but they look cheap and casual.
2.0,"Very cute earrings but unfortunately not made so well. One of earrings will not latch and the other is very loose, but does latch. Really, disappointed because they are so cute. See the pictures. UPDATE: Seller contacted me to send a new pair of earrings since these were defective. However, they were completely sold out. I was offered any pair of in stock earrings they had in their store. I declined the offer. I just wanted everyone to know what great customer service they provided."
2.0,Arrived tarnished.  Very dull after cleaning.
2.0,Top and bottoms sized totally wrong ! Top runs small and the bottom runs large.
2.0,Very baggy under the arms and not fitted.  Seemed like a cheap material.  Ended up returnin product.
2.0,received brown shirtt but did not have the message that was written on shirt message stared before was not beware of dog but all things black and gold.  shirt  writing very small can bearly read it !!!!but love all things brown and orange!!!  was disappointed.
2.0,Very cheap looking not worth the price strap broken.
2.0,Shirt isn't great quality. Thin with a weird hem. and screen print appears faded. I'm not sure my husband will like it. I purchased it as a gift.
2.0,"It's a very nice hat, but combining two sizes (S/M or L/XL) as single-size choices, does not bode well for an accurate fit."
2.0,"Keeps slowing down drastically when I'm wearing it in my coat or pant pocket.<br /><br />Runs on time when not being worn. I guess body temperature affects the accuracy of the watch.<br /><br />The case locking button gets stuck at times and you have to unwind the watch knob a bit to release the button again.<br /><br />Overall, only had appearance, not suitable to replace your wristwatch even by a long shot."
2.0,The material is cheap .. gets torn out easily
2.0,"2 stars because they look great, but they literally broke on my face... happened twice.  look elsewhere."
2.0,The pictures pretty cool on this shirt but the fabric is lost and scratchy indicative of a low quality cheap t-shirt.
2.0,"What I received is nothing like the picture. I ordered it for my daughter, but would be ashamed to give it to her. The one I got is all smashed together with tool marks all over it. I was very disappointed."
2.0,is not what I was expected
2.0,The purse looks nice but the quality is poor. Both zippers on the side were broken and the one on top was hard to open and close. I had to return it.
2.0,"Dear Sir or Madam:<br /><br />First, everyone loves the color! And that's pretty much the high point. Value wise this watch is less than $25.00 dollars so do not expect much quality though. The reason for the low ratings is the clasp on the watch. Its more than likely this model will fall off your wrist often making a terrible gift for someone you actually care about. If you do not align the clasp perfectly the watch continually falls off making it very east to lose! Nuff' said!C"
2.0,Broke 3 times but we fixed it
2.0,"This knit headband is smaller than I expected. It fits my head just fine however it is only about 2.5 inches wide and doesn't cover my ears at all. The yarn used to make this headband is not very soft. Though this headband is cute, I am pretty disappointed."
2.0,"I am not a reviewer per se but I do read a lot of reviews before buying.  The color description on this blouse was orange.  When the blouse arrived it was close to a copper color but very pretty.  I loved the fabric but then I noticed that the right sleeve was not sewn.  So I sent the blouse back and reordered.  The replacement blouse came and the color is peach, the fabric is not the same as the first blouse and the color ran a little in the back (somewhat like a water spot)..  I am keeping this blouse as it will be useable with jeans. I failed to notice that this blouse was coming from China and there is hardly any consistency with quality on products from China.  I will be more alert on where the item is coming from in the future."
2.0,look like nothing
2.0,The ring is far to bulky to be worn as a ring. It would be much better on a chain. It would make a great gift though!
2.0,As far as the lenses go it's just fine. The readers work well.. I don't like how it fits on the bridge of my nose it is not comfortable.
2.0,"This runs a little small, if between sizes size up. I really wanted to like this, but the neck sits awkward."
2.0,"the dress looked nothing like on the picture. I am 5'3&#34; and 126 lbs, and the dress barely hit mid thighs. It is a mini dress, not midi as shown. The sleeves are too tight, I almost felt suffocated. Other than that the quality of a material the dress is made of is very good."
2.0,"Its definitely cheaply made. Zipper is tricky, takes a few tries to get it fully connected, otherwise it splits open at the bottom. Also, NO POCKETS, however, the item description clearly says ""with pockets"". Will serve my basic needs at the gym."
2.0,Head band detached from ribbon.
2.0,"This band is built well, and easy to install but its not comfortable!  Its so heavy duty and stiff its noticeable that you are wearing a watch.  I guess anyone that would have a $500 Samsung Galaxy smart watch and put a $10 band on it is not being smart.  Well its a get you by band till I find something more appropriate as the original leather band broke.  Do yourself a favor and buy and expensive band !!!"
2.0,Bad cut
2.0,Demasiado grande no me gustó
2.0,Returning it. Very small. The material is nice and soft. The colors are pretty.
2.0,Lenses have 2.5 thumbnail mounted too high so I can't easily use the un magnified part of the glasses all 3 pair.
2.0,"It fit smaller than I expected. I usually wear a small but in this jacket, a medium was still snug in the arms even though I can wear it. Not as quilted looking as one might expect but it's okay for a light throw on jacket for $40."
2.0,Very cheaply made.  Very good design.  One set of them was broken.  No returns.  Don’t recommend at all.
2.0,Material is super thin. Otherwise the dress fits nicely.
2.0,Cheap looking. Doesn’t look like metal at all.
2.0,Fits a little weird/ kind of boxy and button broke off easily.
2.0,"The material is very silky, but there’s loose threads all over it. The pants are long enough but too tight over my hips to the point I’m worried they’ll rip if I walk while wearing them."
2.0,"This retainer is SUPER long, and the ends are narrow so it was tight fit to flip it up."
2.0,"While the fabric is lovely, this item does not conform to the size chart.  If you are any larger than an 8, do not buy."
2.0,very thin material.  weird fit.  not flattering.  returned it.  2 stars because the return process was super easy.
2.0,Light weight but not for NYC cold winds disappointed. Cheap looking too
2.0,The waistband is too tight for a large. The pants run small and the sleeves are not long enogh
2.0,"The sleeves are beautiful, but the shirt runs small."
2.0,This is cute dress I got for my girlfriend for ballroom dancing. It didn't even make it through the first wash before 3 buttons fell off. There is literally 1 stitch of thread holding them on. The fabric is a little rough and generally a cheaply made dress. Don't be cheap like me spend the extra money get a nicer dress.
2.0,The elastic waistband is extremely tight and this very uncomfortable!<br />Feel very liquid and hangs very well.
2.0,Hurt to wear
2.0,Earrings are ok but very very small. Maybe appropriate for a 3 year old.
2.0,"The ends aren't weaved or sewn closed, just cut, so the entire end is all loose threads. After washing it, it's going to be a mess, but you can always trim off a quarter inch or so to get back to the original appearance."
2.0,I liked the slipons but they were too narrow for my grandson’s feet
2.0,"Lovely colors in some stones, unfortunately they are the ones with deep cracks running through them (I'm not talking about the usual interest you see in labradorite)."
2.0,too thin like a paqer towl.
2.0,"These are super thin with almost no padding.  Also, no pull tabs to help get them off.  They look nice and generally feel nice, but they are nearly worthless when it comes to actual cushioning."
2.0,The hat on the picture and the hat I received are two different types of hat. The one I received is small and very short at the top. Very ugly shape.
2.0,"the part under the arms are too high, uncomfortable to wear. Shoulder straps are too much sideways, another reason not comfortable."
2.0,Threads were coming off even before the use. Looked cheaply made
2.0,The goggles arrived with a half inch scratch on the lens and continued to get foggy throughout my day skiing. Disappointed.
2.0,Shiny material.  Fits tighter than most larges that fit me.
2.0,"These earrings seem really cute and look high end and designer on the surface. Nothing particularly wrong with the design, but one of the first things I noticed when I received them was how there was absolutely no gift packaging. The earrings arrived in a small cellophane bag, and that's about it. No drawstring pouch, no box, nothing. If you were intending to gift these earrings, you should probably make sure to buy a box or some packaging on your own, and put them inside to dress up the gift. That's only if you want to gift the item at all.<br /><br />Second, you probably wouldn't want to gift these earrings at all anyway, because right when I removed the backings, I immediately noticed some gray discoloration on both posts where the backers were. I tried to wash it off with soap, but that didn't help. This made me not even want to try on the earrings, and it would likely turn off anyone who you gift the item to.<br /><br />I'd recommend really buying something a little more expensive that is of higher quality."
2.0,Really lovely ..but the second time I wore them broke 😳
2.0,i applied a little bit of pressure and it broke
2.0,Great colors but doesn't fit well.  Too much exposed and fabric is not great.
2.0,Wasn't expecting them to have magnification on them. The description doesn't state that well. They are also much smaller than expected.
2.0,Thinner than I expected also fits quite snug. Not a huge fan..
2.0,"Item is not for everyday use. I am becoming somewhat of a collector. Expensive and not so expensive glasses. Byt these felt poorly made, cheap. Perfect for a costume perhaps. Maybe. Nothing I would ever wear or gift at all. Seems like they would break in a few wears. I initiated the return immediately upon holding them in my hands. I would not buy or recommend these. Plenty of inexpensive, yet stylish quality glasses around."
2.0,"The bag is cute and holds a lot, but still very disappointed. The side leather piece that holds on the strap broke after the first couple uses."
2.0,It was reslly small. Wish It was bigger.
2.0,"Top is cute but only after 2 wears I already see pilling on sleeves.  I'm sad, had wanted to love it."
2.0,The Color was a little more pigmented than what it shows in the picture. I was expecting the brown to be a little lighter. Band fits perfectly on my Apple Watch easy to put on and takeoff.
2.0,Title misleading. Its a bottle opener not a keychain
2.0,"I'm a size 6, probably even bigger than the model in the pic but the pants hang low, and look like I'm wearing a burlap sack. I'm keeping them, and will try them in summer with a bikini top, and rewrite review. Maybe just too baggy with heavy layers from winter."
2.0,These would work well for toddlers 2-3years old. Not quite big enough for my 6 year old. They don't stay in place and fog up
2.0,"I was sent the wrong bar. It was cute so I kept it, but after a day it started to irritate my ear. After two days I had to remove it because it was causing a lot of discomfort."
2.0,IT WILL NOT STAY ON MY HEAD.  I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND FEEL WAS A WASTE OF TIME
2.0,"I should have known better! Not at all true to size! I ordered a XXL, larger than I usually buy. Too tight at the chest"
2.0,These were very sheer and completely are through for me.
2.0,"One of my glasses came damaged (water damage or something happened to the glasses themselves because the box was fine). There's a mark on the top left lens, it's not in the eye view but it's still noticeable and sucks. Pictures are of the inside and outside of lens. The others seem to be okay though. Tried to return to order a different set but I guess returns aren't allowed with this shipment."
2.0,"I was under the impression that this was larger and was a functioning whistle, it was NOT and was VERY small"
2.0,Not supportive for large or heavy beasts. Causes unibreast. Wont purchase again
2.0,"I ordered up a size like everyone suggested and the fit was fine. Unfortunately these did not make much of a difference with the spin bike. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I was hoping the padding would come further towards the front."
2.0,"some of the feathers on the hat were  not attached, hence reason for the return"
2.0,Tight on the butt but loose on my waist. Not flattering. Cheaply made.
2.0,The size large was much larger than it showed styled in the photo.  Returning it because it is too large.
2.0,WAY WAY WAY TOO BIG
2.0,"Beautiful style,<br />But ring change color after a few wears"
2.0,So Cute! Just like the picture! BUT the panda fell off after only a few hours of wear :(
2.0,It doesn’t fit well.
2.0,"The item came deeply wrinkled, The material is thin and stiff, and the skirt is much shorter thank shown."
2.0,"I LOVED this bathing suit.  The fit was perfect.  It was truly No-tug.  It was comfortable.  It also faded so badly within a month of wearing while bathing at the Y three times a week that you could SEE through it.  It's one thing for the color to fade, another thing that the material deteriorated to such a point you could see through it.  I LOVE the bathing suit, but if it isn't going to last any longer than that,  it's not worth the price, no matter what it is."
2.0,"Very small,  my waist is 28 1/2 inches and it is too tight for me,  I am keeping it because it is nice,  I will replace the elastic part (since I do some alterations),  but this belt is not for someone bigger than a size 3."
2.0,"I love pumpkin spice as much as the next chick, but these are disappointing. This set is made of Polyester material which I think will be hot to sleep in. The top is very wide but short, which may be a good fit for someone with a bigger bust. but I have a long torso and not much on top. It also annoys me how the orange on the shorts doesn’t match the shirt. The shirt text is like a salmon or coral. I may ask my sister to make a replacement with her cricket. This is not the basic you want to be. Save your money and buy something quality."
2.0,The face is so shiny that it is very difficult to read the time.
2.0,These were cute black with red faux fur boot covers but constantly fell down. My daughter wore them for 5 minutes before she ripped off and gave up so it ended up being a complete waste of money for us. I was going to return but by the time I would've paid shipping costs I'd be losing money so now they're in a bin in the basement collecting dust.
2.0,Did not fit and cost too much to return.
2.0,Very small purse. Very stiff and not alot of room. Good for people who love small purses. This purse will not fit a laptop and will only fit a magazine if it is bended in half. I like medium to large purses.
2.0,Because those reflective bands was not have made of the same material they did not stretch like the uniform would and therefore when they where cut the same size it is actually smaller then the uniform and could not stretch appropriately to fit.
2.0,"I actually loved it until I carried my purse over my shoulder and when I got home I realized that the dress was ruined.<br />Turns out the fabric is such poor quality that if you rub anything against it, it balls up."
2.0,It's quite cheap looking and thankfully it's a gift for someone that won't care too much.
2.0,"Although it's cute, it looks NOTHING like the pic"
2.0,The surface area that touched my skin is not at all polished as smoothly as it should with such a material and had visible nics around the edges upon arrival. It caused my ears to become raw and sore. They were pretty but significantly darker than the picture. Almost black. At no fault of the product I did end up dropping one in the bathtub and it knocked a huge chunk off one of them but I didn't really plan to continue using them anyway due to the mediocre quality.
2.0,"Buyer beware the beautiful ornaments on the straps don’t stay attached. We had this pair of shoes for less than a week before one of the ornaments was lost, after I reattached it. They are beautiful but really a one time wear kind of shoe, very disappointed as I planned for my daughter to wear them through the holiday season, for the various events."
2.0,get what you pay for cheap and runs large
2.0,It slides off your face as soon as you start moving around.
2.0,"I wanted to love this. Once you wash it the materiel feels excellent to the touch, but being mostly polyester it’s pretty hot for sleeping.<br /><br />The top is two sizes different than the bottoms. I would prefer my bottoms loose for sleeping n my top more fitted.<br /><br />Makes zero sense that you would put a button at the nape of the neck in pajamas too. It’s not low cut or even necessary that it has a button. All the pockets are fake pockets too."
2.0,"Oh gosh I should have looked more closely at ALL the listing photos. I mean I knew it couldn't have actually said G U C C I if it were designer imitation. The photo I saw just showed the 'C"" so I didn't expect it to say, ""CUCCI"" which sounds a little like something obscene. So, I can either wear it an laugh about it, or not wear it at all.<br /><br />The scarf itself is grey medium with a nice looking lattice pattern and neutral color. All of the options are unisex in my opinion. It's a little thin so best for Fall and Spring imo. I have much thicker, better quality cashmere scarfs I prefer to wear in the dead of winter here in Colorado that actually keep me warm.<br /><br />It says to dry clean only because this is a cashmere, cotton, linen and silk blend. I find that hard to believe for the cost but ok. Just keep in mind dry cleaning adds to the cost of this item so it may not be as good a deal as it seems. Just keep that hidden cost in mind. But I did give it two stars instead of one for the natural fiber blend that somewhat makes up for the labeling fiasco.<br /><br />It's definitely affordable but I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable gifting something that says ""CUCCI"" unless English was a second language (or they don't speak English) or they are younger or elderly and don't care that much about brand names since they can't afford the real deal anyway. Even so.<br /><br />A good gift for a college kid with a sense of humor, maybe. Just pray they don't get mugged over something that says ""CUCCI"". That would make an interesting headline."
2.0,For all of the bloggers raving they're just like Lulu leggings...not a chance. They were so stiff and came with a chemical odor. One bend or yoga pose and they were immediately see through. I returned them - there's a reason Lulu comes with a steep price tag. They're worth it!
2.0,Used it for a couple of weeks and the plastic part that adjusts the length of the straps broke.
2.0,Cheaply made. Kept fogging up to the point that it wasn’t usable.
2.0,Got this because my grandson had troubles keeping glasses on during gym or active essays but I cant get them on his glasses🤨
2.0,These gloves are not as warm as I thought they would be.  I’m not very happy.
2.0,"It’s an overall nice bag, but the clips for the straps gave out after one use. I hade to hotglue the latch shut. (I didn’t have any superglue."
2.0,smaller than I thought they would be
2.0,The stone were not place evenly in the settings the lettering was small font
2.0,"I ordered 2 different leather looking earrings for gifts for Christmas. These are not as thick as the others I ordered and the backs are felt like material. I would not order these again, they are cute from the front, but not good quality. don't like that the backs are not the same material because if they get twisted around, the backs are not the same color as the front of the earring."
2.0,They sent me two of the same badge and I'm missing one of them. The box itself seems a bit beat up and the badges are a bit dirty. The quality of the badges itself are good however.
2.0,"Got it in July and no is the end of October and the plastic divider is fully broken on both ends , it's very nice while it last! :-("
2.0,"way too small, and not the greatest quality"
2.0,"way too small for anything, or anyone over the age of 2"
2.0,Good quality material and color but the women’s size medium could fit my 9 year old. WAY to small! I run a size 6 and they were half my size.
2.0,They run very very very small I got an xl instead of a med and they don’t fit him. They are nice sweats if they weren’t so small
2.0,"Very cute bag and the material is quite pleasant, but the zipper broke the first time I used it.<br /><br />Update, even the zipper on the outside pocket that I haven't touched once came apart"
2.0,Works poorly for the price. Tried to use with my mask while working outside in Seattle. Don't recommend.
2.0,"These look so cheap. They don't look like the pictures. The beads have too much clear coating or something on them. Also, the bracelets that came on my package were not very cute."
2.0,"Not as described.runs hella short, ass or no ass to rise it!! IT RUNS SHORT😞:-("
2.0,Nothing like the picture. Also it is n9t stamped. It is the quality of 4.99 jewelry. I would not recommend.
2.0,Whole heartedly disappointed in the quality of this product. For the price it should be way better.
2.0,Cheaply made. Fell apart the first time it was worn.
2.0,I'm not a fan of the material and the cross on the shoulders dont lay as intended. It just looks weird. Disappointed.
2.0,Not true to size I’m a 18 the legs were to small
2.0,Stone already fell out after a few weeks of use.
2.0,Just opened package due to weather change....... It's a nice design but VERY linty. So many fibers left on my clothes.
2.0,Looks nice enough and doesn't looks or feel cheap but breaks way too easily.
2.0,"too short,retuned"
2.0,The infinity symbol fell off after one weekend of wearing.  The rope / clasp unraveled as well.
2.0,"Very poor packaging. The necklace was detached from the ties that hold down the jewelry inside of the box. This could have cause damage during shippment. Also, the necklace looked like it may have been open maybe tired on because of the detachment."
2.0,Cloth is good. Plastic tie gizmo springs are too weak to hold the socks up. Velcro on elastic band will be better.
2.0,Fabric quality was not great. It looked a little faded and there were weird places with non matching thread.
2.0,"Very thin material and runs small, but will do to wear around the house."
2.0,"I have a vintage 5x beaver fur felt cowboy hat that had gone really soft.  I followed directions, including steaming, and this product while adding some body to the felt did not make the felt stiff despite putting on about six light coats.  After seeing a youtube video on using some clear shellac in a spray can I decided to try that.  After three light coats the hat is stiff like new and now will hold its shape."
2.0,don't protect the whole eye.
2.0,"So, these were super cute and looked JUST like the picture. But I only got about 2 weeks use out of them. I was cleaning my room, knocked them off of my jewelry box (sits about 4 feet off the ground) and they shattered :("
2.0,"Great product, works. But losses it’s shock power over ~6 mnts"
2.0,I was very disappointed once I received these! They weren't as nice in person compared to pictures. The quality of the earrings were cheap looking in my opinion. They seemed very brittle - I can see them becoming unclasped. Was expecting a better pair of earrings. Will be returning
2.0,Wasn’t impressed and which all other jewelry I’ve orderedI’ve been quite pleased with but this just wasn’t it
2.0,Poorly made. Low quality.
2.0,"I love the dress, but it had dog or cat hair all over it! I’m sure I’ll enjoy it but prefer not to think of where it may have been. Smells ok, I’ll wash it and wear it😁"
2.0,This dress is a bit weird.  I ordered a Large and it's too big at the top but toomey small at the bottom. Also the pic makes it look like the bottom half flares out....it doesn't it's about as flat as 2 week old soda. I'm returning it
2.0,"I’ll be the first to acknowledge I’m not the best at fine motor skills, so having written that, I couldn’t size the thing.  Watched vid, but bent pins, missed hole, not getting them out, the tool was fine, but putting them in.  Apparently there are folks that would need a jeweler to size it.  Looks like a nice band though.<br /><br />Ended up returning it."
2.0,Like every other Ghostbuster prop replica I have purchased this year this product showed up only half working. There is clearly a short somewhere inside of this causing it to only work when its shaken around a bit and even then it's not very often it does work. I plan on gutting it next year anyways to mod it with different stuff but for the money you pay it should work as advertised when purchased.
2.0,"On the picture for &#34;black&#34; it shows black socks with blue patterned tops, but then i find out oncw I get them in the mail that they are only black. I could have paid less if i wanted a plain pair. False advertising. Don't know if it's worth sending them back or not..."
2.0,"The material was too big in the bust area, the overall size was good but too much over lapping fabric & extra material in bust area, maybe b/c it was a smal & larger sizes ok, but I have decent sized boobs for my body & didn’t look right."
2.0,"These mittens are warm and the palm area fits as expected for a women’s medium, however the wrist opening seems to be small or extra small. I have small hands but sized up to accommodate a thumb brace I normally wear - no way! I could barely get these on without the brace, although when I did, the palm area was large. They appear to be warm and well made but don’t work for me."
2.0,"The chest had ridden up uncomfortably, like a smaller bust was expected."
2.0,Cheap plastic and brown instead of red.
2.0,"Came in two sections. Broke before I wore it, second piece was too small."
2.0,"This is not a solid color like the beautiful color they show here..and it doesn't feel like a sweater. But I paid for it so I will make the best of it. Oh there is no tag no brand ,no instructions on how to care for it. Reminds me of something you get from the dollar store. Length is nice though and the style is the same as shown. Disappointed with two things I have ordered now..:/"
2.0,"Honestly, the product runs so small. Bought a large one but is more like a small one.<br />The material is very very cheap. This product really belongs in the 1 dollar store. I think the only reason why they are expensive is because they match and are christmassy.<br />The material is very uncomfortable and doesnt stretch."
2.0,I wanted to love this dress. I thought a sweater dress with the shoulders out what's not to love. BUT the dress flares out around your hips almost like your wearing a costume. I looked ridiculous in it. It just wasn't for me.
2.0,Not very comfy. More of a one time use product.
2.0,Complete fail. It doesn’t stay on.
2.0,"Weird fit, returned it."
2.0,"Got these pants for games. Pants looked and fit great, but holes sprouted in the knees on opening day before he even played his first game. So disappointed."
2.0,"The seam on one of the legs is so misaligned that it comes down the front of my lower leg instead of the side like normal. The crotch is also very tight, though the rest fits appropriately. Also thinner and not as soft as I expected."
2.0,Be careful with sizes is Chines and sizes are so small!
2.0,Buy a size bigger.
2.0,"Unfortunately this dress will not work for me. I sized up as suggested and feel like there is a lot of extra fabric. It has this really weird puffy part around the middle which makes it look like you have a giant roll around your tummy. The fabric is beautiful, albeit pretty itchy. I am going to have to return it."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. The material is 100% polyester (even the bib detail, which I was hoping was embroidered or would have some type of texture or extra detail). The material has a sheen to it, which makes it look super cheap and it's pretty see through. It fit like a maternity dress, but I didn't even want to save it for potential use since a baby bump would make the front way too short (it's already pretty short to begin with). I didn't expect too much for $24, but this wasn't even worth half of that. The floral pattern is pretty though."
2.0,"I love the texture of the bras, they are extremely comfortable. But the snaps are extremely cheap and fragile. I went to unsnap the nursing clip as soon as I opened my package and the clip completely broke. I also ordered up 1 size from what I am now because once my milk comes in I know I'll need the extra room, and it was just a little bit too tight in the breast area for the size I am now. And I also had to use the bra extenders on their loosest setting. So I should have ordered up 2, maybe even 3 sizes bigger to accomplish comfortability."
2.0,The stem is too long.
2.0,The material is so thin
2.0,"I have worn Gloria Vanderbilt pants and other items ever since I discovered the Amanda line.  I just knew I would love these shorts. Not sure how they would fit so I ordered a size 6 and a size 8. I am normally a size 6. Kept the size 8 and returned the size 6.  Even the size 8 fit is too snug and hard to get on due to the tight elastic around the waist.  The material is very heavy material.  I have worn these several times, washed in delicate and hang dried. They have faded in ""wear"" spots, especially in the waist elastic and thick bottom hems. The more I wear, the more fade spots appear in various places.  Disappointed in this GV product and would not recommend."
2.0,"*Not the color that was advertised: it shows a coral peach shade, this is strait up light pink.<br /><br />*Totally see-through, wearing black underwear, and you can see it.<br /><br />*not high waisted like it shows. It’s mid rise, and does not have a strong hold in stomach area.<br /><br />* soft, but not quality."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:c178b0809ca2b163bb4fd0fc072505ac]] I wanted to buy this because it said it would be a quiet fan and at low fan speed it is roughly 50db and high fan speed it gets to 60db. Then it makes a high pitch whine which is very noticeable. Wish there was a analog dial to regulate the speed of the fan since I don’t need the fan to be going as fast as it does, it would help with the whine also. Then I tried clasping the head strap to the mask and the buttons just keep falling out and don’t stay attached even with me not wearing it. I would not recommend this until it is made of better quality and have a quieter fan."
2.0,The zipper broke immediately!
2.0,"Did not like the blackish coloring, stone looked out of place. I like bright shinny silver look. Will be returning."
2.0,Se regresó por tamaño muy pequeño
2.0,clamps very weak on bracelet. didn't last a full day of wearing. like the bracelet hate the clamp
2.0,Ok ok
2.0,"This product is very good, but it is not for Fenix 5.  I had to give it away to someone who owns a Fenix 3 as it is a narrower fit for the 5."
2.0,These run very small. I would not recommend for a grown man.
2.0,Couldn’t wear these for more than an hour and a half in Vegas
2.0,It was cute and the color was great but the fabric was very scratchy. It was too bad because other than that I really like the dress. I returned it when I realized I couldn’t stand the fabric
2.0,I returned the pink dress and kept the black one. Black is Black. But this “pink” is very dull and not the typical shade of pink I prefer to wear. I wish it was a true PINK as the dress itself is very pretty and made from nice material.
2.0,This is a very cute swim suit. They run small and the bottoms do not cover up much. Great for lounging around once wet the can be a little see through. The price is right but not a great suit for being in the water.
2.0,"The fabric seems nice, and I wanted to like this shirt, but...<br />After having 2 kids, I have a bit of a ""mommy pouch"" of a belly. Unfortunately, the way this shirt sits, the elastic band tends to accentuate my belly, in such a way that it looks like I'm wearing a maternity shirt (I'm not currently pregnant).<br />If you have a pretty flat stomach, this shirt may look nice on you, but if you don't, it can make you look like you're expecting."
2.0,Didnt like the material. No give to it and very warm. Couldnt keep it as I am chesty and evwn getting a 2X didnt fit.
2.0,"garbage, these slippers fit fine, they keep your feet warm, but the fur lining in them will start to come out and their will be bare/bald spots in the foot bed of the shoe.  I only wear these around the house and have had them for less than a year and they are falling apart.  I would never buy these again and could not recommend anyone else buy them.  also, Ugg will decline to help you out with shipping for warranty purposes on this item because you bought it from amazon and not Ugg"
2.0,These were cute. However they were not dainty nor were they well made. One earring was really bent when it arrived.
2.0,"The quality of the material is very good; however, the right shoe light went out shortly after charging."
2.0,"When I received this belly ring I loved it! It’s looks great and the white gold was perfect because I am allergic to silver. Fast for a little over a month and one of the prong heads has broken off the setting. This cannot be repaired due to the stone being synthetic. The heat from replacing the prong would destroy the stone. So now, my only option is to wear and hope the other 3 prongs keep the stone tight. Eventually it will get loose and likely fall out. I really wanted to give this five stars but this is unacceptable after such a short period of wear."
2.0,It's super cute but doesnt have buttons in the crotch area. Ordered a 12-18 month for my 1 year old and had a hard time getting it on her.
2.0,My son really liked this but it broke the first day. There’s a tiny plastic piece on the interior that is necessary to trigger the music and it broke rendering the toy to paperweight status.
2.0,Runs too big in the boob area. Terrible fit. Not transparent. Nice quality.
2.0,"Pretty but does not fit around the neck as it should. It just hangs there.  The claps need to be moved to the top of the necklace, maybe then it would fit correctly."
2.0,do not buy..cheap looking.
2.0,Nice quality but this fit more like a kid size. Decent price for a set. It’s a nice order but just not for me.
2.0,"These earrings had a very nice luster, how ever they were two different sizes and colors. I contacted the seller who was responsive and I received a replacement pair. The same problem occurred. Its almost like they erroneously mixed the button style and regular earrings. As mentioned by another reviewer, it wouldn't have worked to mix and match the two pair,,,they were too far off for consistency. I then tried JORA 14K and they are fine but luster is not as nice, but they match at least."
2.0,Fit bit
2.0,"No support, or fit, what so ever. Very pretty but the fit was so bad that my chest spent most of the time in the lace band below the cups.<br />Don't buy!"
2.0,I found that it is difficult to tighten when looped.... My other belts similar to this are very easy to tighten.... Just pull the strap and it adjusts. This does not.
2.0,imagined beads larger also expect it a little wider on the wrist. other then that the quality is very nice.
2.0,"Follow me on Instagram! @lipglosssed<br /><br />I bought this for my daughter, she is 10. This bangle looks to be very well made, however LARGE. I bought this specific one because I assumed it would be on the smaller side since the description says Teen Girls. It's not adjustable either so she won't be able to wear it."
2.0,"I was somewhat disappointed with the look and material of the dress. I liked the way the dress appeared in the picture. The material is somewhat stretchy, and around my bust area the material stretched out and changed color. I ordered medium. Do not like this at all. Also the length is too long. I would need to do some altering. I wish I would have known what material this was before I ordered. I was just looking for a long nice light weight summer dress to dress up or down. It's too heavy and stretchy. I don't really care for the pattern of the dress either. So disappointed."
2.0,Small fit.  Perfect for children
2.0,These sunglasses didn't fit and were heavier than the last pair I had.
2.0,They don't really keep the sun out of my eyes very well.
2.0,Looks like a trash bag in orange was to lose and short at the same time.
2.0,"This shoe is very comfortable and my feet are happy ... but I'm nor ... the quality of the material is not good. The shoe sidewall textile material has lost the color and has already faded although the shoe has not been that long with me, about 5 months, which makes it look shabby, moreover, the stretch material in the corners has a torn look and is absolutely inferior in quality. I did not wash the shoe or treat it in any way harshly yet it looks as if it's 3 years old. Unfortunately I will not buy this brand again."
2.0,I have seen other people saying that the metal bothered their ears.  I don't know if they'll bother my ears or not because I can't even get them in!  I thought I had mistakenly purchased children's earrings.  The posts are so short - unless your earlobes are very thin. Wasted my money on these.
2.0,"This belt is INCREDIBLY long. Probably good for thicker waists, but if you are tiny, you are going to have about 2 feet hanging"
2.0,It's kind of big but i dont really have a choice and it was like 3 weeks late.
2.0,"I ordered a 2x and it's labeled a 2x but I can barely get my arm in it. Normally, a 2x is big on me and I wanted it to be slightly oversized. I wear anywhere from a large to a 2x depending on brand, style, etc. and I couldn't even put this on.  So, I would say the size is not true to fit at all. In every other respect, it was exactly what I was looking for."
2.0,"These are not what I was expecting at all.  They are not cotton or soft, and have a very stiff and scratchy fabric.  I really like the fit on these though, but I cannot see myself wearing these.  I may use them if I ever do a project like painting or something where I need something light to wear.  Otherwise, these are a no from me."
2.0,"Holds the shirt well and seems well made, but I'm 6'2'' and this product is not even close to being able to fit, even at maximum adjustment it pulls down hard on shirt and alters its look."
2.0,Very small for an adult hat. The hat is also much stiff unlike most hats like this which are soft.
2.0,Not too effective.
2.0,The lenses are not polarized and they are not cut correctly. I had trouble getting them to fit correctly
2.0,"Dress was fine for the price, but it was not the color I needed so I started the return process. Initially they suggested I keep the dress and receive a partial refund, (but I have no need for the dress otherwise so I declined that offer). The seller then gave me an international return address, so I had to specify a US return address. I mailed the return and confirmed the delivery through the tracking number and have still yet to receive my refund!<br />Just be sure on the color and size before you buy!"
2.0,These are not for bigger girls. If you have thick calves/ankles these are so tight they cut off circulation.
2.0,"The pants are too short. Great otherwise. I am 5’10” but would not suggest if you are taller than 5’8”. I like to roll pants up but they are even too short for that. Unfortunately, they do not offer longer lengths."
2.0,"always slides further back and back until its almost covering my eyes<br />cant adjust it... felt quality is... not great, just soso<br />maybe works well for people with a small head, women and kids?"
2.0,"I rarely write reviews for anything I get through Amazon, but I honestly had to after this.<br /><br />Firstly, the costume came in extremely late. Like, not only was it not delivered by the original date, they gave me a new delivery date and it didn’t come in until TWO DAYS after that (a grand total of 7 days after the original delivery date).<br /><br />And secondly, the skirt is significantly smaller than advertised. Based on reviews and past experiences I sized up one size so I could guarantee a fit, but the skirt is so small both around the waist and in terms of length that I can’t believe it’s marked as a Large.<br /><br />Honestly, the only reason this is getting any stars is that the shirt is nice and fits well.<br /><br />I’m pretty disappointed and honestly a bit upset in this purchase."
2.0,These were very difficult to get in my ears and the color is much different than the picture.
2.0,there is a front seam that is not flattering and the sheerness is very extreme. the waist seam is very tight and makes the dress look too small even if the dress fits
2.0,"Read the reviews and ordered the next size up, an XL, and it fit perfectly... until the first wash!  Being polyester and nylon I assumed (wrongly) it wouldn’t shrink like cotton.  However, it did and would make a great crop top now!  Would not recommend this ."
2.0,Product size I chose for this beret was &#34;large slouch&#34;.  What I got was a small sized beret.
2.0,"The design of the sweatshirt is the same in the front and back. The front has some of the characters cut off because of the arm sleeve sowed overtop of it. The sleeves are a completely different style than what the picture is which is disappointing because 2 characters are cut off from the design. The back has a little bit more of the design but still, also has the 2 characters cut off from the sowing.<br /><br />If you don't mind missing some of the characters and having the design of the photo being a little blurry then it could be good for you."
2.0,"material is very heavy and stiff, uncomfortable on skin. Poor stitching,  no care tag on the dress, only shows on the wrapper some basic care, unknown fabric, and it is dry clean only. sorry, i have to returned it."
2.0,"really bad smell, very foul. wanted t return but I may have taken off the tag. It's also not the quality you're expecting, look very cheap. I wish I can return this !"
2.0,"If you're an avid oversleeper with good problem solving skills you'll figure out how to turn this off or just take it off. It's an interesting gimmick, but it's honestly probably just that."
2.0,"I bought Maroon and black. The maroon color was so off everyone I showed it to thought it was red. Material was poor . Plastic looking. I guess you get what you paid for! Unfortunately ,  I had to return the product"
2.0,"After I gave these to my cousin, she accidentally dropped one off the kitchen table and the metal inset instantly popped out.  There were old glue lines on the wood, it just wasn't made well.  I used super glue to put it back together."
2.0,"It’s very pretty but I found over time it stretches and gets longer. Also, the ends are not secured so I found myself re-braiding it several times a day and eventually out elastics at the end of it. It I didn’t the whole thing would have eventually unraveled."
2.0,The sizing was all wrong!
2.0,It only raises your heel and the rest of your foot is left at a slant. Not comfortable at all. I could barely wear them for 10 minutes.
2.0,Too big and very heavy.
2.0,"My dress was not red, it was wine/ burgundy- I had to return it. It also had a few loose strings and the tie was smaller than pictured. Also, the material looked cheap- the dress did not look as nice as it does in the picture."
2.0,The sandals are beautiful!! I fell in love at first sight but… they are too big on the sides for me so when I try to walk my feet feel insecure and unbalanced.<br />If they were a bit tighter on the part that surrounds your feet probably they would give more stability.<br />I have them to my sister in law who has thicker feet and she said the same “I need to walk carefully with them because they don’t feel too safe”<br />If they can fix that this would be a great pair of sandals
2.0,Smaller than size description
2.0,The arms are WAAAAAAY too long. Had to alter it before use.
2.0,"Size was smaller than expected, but fit one of my other granddaughters."
2.0,"Well, I took a chance, but no big deal, I just sent it back. I usually wear a size M and occasionally a L. The M was WAAY too small, XL might fit me, and at 5'3"" it drags on the floor. Super thin material, would not last long."
2.0,Too big...I plan on returning the dress. It is cute but way too big.
2.0,"I would say if you have wider hips order a size up. I’m usually a medium - large and the large was very tight. The pants also did not come with the belt, which is very disappointing. I’m currently losing weight so I’ll hold onto the pants till I can fit into them."
2.0,This cover up seemed by the photo to be super easy to just throw on and look cute. it is a one size fits all item and I am a size 2...it is so large that it drapes down past my waist when I put the loops over my arms.  This is not for those who are small.
2.0,Looks very nice but it frays
2.0,"Hat looks cute, however arrived with creases that would not relax out, so I had to return it."
2.0,"So I've used these maybe 5x since I've purchased these mainly because I didn't feel the impact they were supposed to provide. I felt as though these items were hyped, they were very lightweight and kinda cool to wear. I didn't feel as though it helped at all for me. This may be different for others, but nothing for me."
2.0,"Very scratchy, cheap looking fabric.  Neckline is gathered with an elastic band and picture doesn't show that."
2.0,"Very bright green, much brighter then shown here.<br /><br />These shoes came from CHINA so the delivery time was very long."
2.0,Sleeves way to small and much shorter than the picture.
2.0,These pants are thin and not clean white.  I got them for my daughter to wear for TBall but they fit so baggy and look dingy so she couldn't even wear them for that.
2.0,"We bought this for my 6 year olds birthday.  She was disappointed.  The dress fit well, however the Velcro circles that held the straps to the dress would not stay together.  The wings were droopy because they Velcro to the dress and were too heavy for the material.  She loved the lights on the heels of the shoes but while the shoes fit for size they were so narrow in the heel and being plastic they stuck to her feet causing blisters on her heels.  She was disappointed that the wand did not have any kind of light up feature or sound.  The crown was stuck together plastic beads that again did not impress her as pretty.  All together, not something I would have bought if I could have seen it in person before purchasing.  Certainly not worth what I paid for it."
2.0,The white part is just painted over the yellow part.  Two days of my daughter wearing and the white paint is already pealing off.
2.0,"&#34;Oh, mommythesearethecutestcombatbootseverilooooooovethem!&#34;<br />As a result of my poor influence, my daughter has an affinity for combat and engineer-style boots.  Her feet were resisting the confines of her favorite pair and it was high time for a larger size.  I thought these were super cute and that she would love them.  I was right in that regard.  She was unfortunately a bit disappointed when, just a week later, the laminated coating on the surface of the vinyl began to peel.  Mich ro my chagrin, she decided that the large bits of missing coating were worth it because the boots themselves were great.  That is, until the soles became detached from the boot.  This was within two weeks.  We live in Chicago and this was during the worst of the winter, so they didn't get much outdoor use and the consequential detrimental exposure to the elements.  I could have done better to plastic wrap her feet."
2.0,Way too cheap. Returned and bought a timex ironman instead. It is way nicer and costs just 20 bucks more.
2.0,i ordered a medium....its huge!!! i cant even wear it :( returning
2.0,2 strands were shorter than the other making the bracelet too tight.  I had to return.
2.0,"Lightweight, cute cut, but unusable for me.  They were so LARGE that they could touch my ears, my neck and shoulders at the same time.  They could have easily replaced my Mom's lenses in a pair of her 80's-style glasses with room to spare.  No joke, these babies are so big, I think Zeus used the jagged ones when he was packin' his bolts. Perhaps they were created for Shaq's twin sister, because I can't see an average sized person being able to wear them.  If these fit you, would you please post a picture of you with them on?  I'm fascinated to see if I was really Quasimodo in my past life and that's why they looked like giant footballs hanging from my ears."
2.0,I thought I was getting several glasses strap for the price. It’s only one. Umm Return!
2.0,These look good enough but the top ball keeps coming off... On all of them
2.0,Does not follow sizing chart. About 2 sizes too smal
2.0,"Not what I expected, color was off."
2.0,Too small for size. But my daughter loved them. I decided not to return them for a larger size only based on the fact that she refuses to take them off despite the fact that her feet are killing her.
2.0,"This is the size of a child's neck, approximately 8.5 inches long. It will fit me but it gives the word ""choker"" an entirely new meaning!"
2.0,"I have ordered this suit before and really like it so I ordered another one. They sent me it right away, however the outside sticker on the bag says 14, which is what I ordered however after washing it, it turns out to be a size 16. Too big. Double check the actual size of suit before removing tag and washing it. It cannot be returned after you wash it."
2.0,"This is a Halloween-costume quality item, and would serve that purpose - except that it is sized about 7 sizes too small. I think the sizes must be for women, children, or perhaps your slimmer Hobbits."
2.0,"Thought it came with the vest, but all I got were the leggings. If it's only the leggings then the product description and photos are extremely misleading. Would not have bought it if I knew - needed the outfit by friday!"
2.0,The material and fit was all off and way too big
2.0,"First, these are smaller than you might think.  If you have small ears, they may be fine.  Second, they arrived in a padded envelope and were broken.  I can fix, so it's not worth returning to China, but ... really not a professional presentation.  Very disappointed after waiting so long."
2.0,"These earrings are really cute!  They are dainty and I was excited to get them.  The problem is, unless you are used to wearing earring with a larger gauge than most these will be uncomfortable for you.  I couldn't even get the post pushed through my earring hole all the way, and I personally don't want to stretch the holes open just for this earring to fit.  I haven't had this problem with any other earrings before, so it's not just my ears or anything.  They just make these posts bigger than the standard earring.  Also, these earrings click together to form a complete circle once they are in your ear, and the part that clicks into the earring is a little bit sharp! I was scared if I did get them in my ear that it might scratch inside the hole on the way out.  The earrings themselves seem like a good quality product.  They are very sturdy, not cheap feeling at all.  And I think they're really cute!  I just can't wear them :(.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  I enjoy helping shoppers like you make informed decisions before you make an online purchase."
2.0,The fabric was thin and felt like a cheese cloth. The sleeves were too short. There was a hole in one of the arm pits. The pockets are useless as nothing will stay in them and the patch sewed onto the outside of it looked like a last minute decision so it doesnt even complement tbe design. The frayed edges are supposed to give it an edgy look but because its all the way up the buttons it just looks like a hot mess. I returned and got my money back. I was so hoping it would be as good as it looks in the pictures but it was a flop for me.
2.0,Dress was too big and they don’t have it available in small or custom sizes. I also asked if they would be getting an in and they said not this year.
2.0,Flimsy but cute
2.0,The colors of the flowers in the add showed purple but they are more blue than purple. Disappointed
2.0,En la foto se ve mejor
2.0,Too difficult to clasp this watch.<br />I returned it .<br />Bill L.
2.0,The fit was alright through the chest but the hem line from front to back was off. Too short in the front compared to the length of material in the back.
2.0,Too small for my fingers
2.0,Sometimes you find a great product at a disproportionately low price. This was no such bargain.
2.0,"Bought this for my son and thought this would hold up for a while. Great material, thicker fleece than expected which was a plus however, after three washes, the entire zipper fell off. Was very disappointed about that. Was too late to return item. Not happy."
2.0,"Way smaller than advertised. Ordered large, fits like small/medium."
2.0,I had to return it. It was fitting fine until I realize it was made for someone shorter then me and I’m 5’8.
2.0,I ordered short or petite and they should have fit in length but they were too long. All of the danskin now women's active and dir more were too long. The gray women's dri more relaxed were a little snug at first but they were not too long. They stretched some and fit okay.
2.0,"It was cute, but at only 5'3, it was almost obscenely short. After washing it once, you could literally see my underwear when I stood still."
2.0,The cape has a weird stuff written on the back and stains like oil
2.0,This robe is very thin (see thru). I returned it.
2.0,The jewel part of the earrings looks pretty decent but the backing clasp on one of them is completely misaligned and does not close properly. My wife can't even wear them because one of the earrings doesn't stay on her ear. So in our case the earrings are completely worthless. For nearly 20 dollars I'd think I could get at least functional fake earrings.
2.0,They felt good the first few times wearing them until the waist band stitching began weakening then started getting undone. It’s just past the return date and I’m stuck with them....
2.0,"I ordered the red gingham print, and the print/color is really cute in person, but the fit of this was terrible. I’ve ordered quite a few bathing suits on Amazon and this is the first I’m returning. There was a bunch of extra material where it shouldn’t be. I couldn’t get the bottoms to lay flat in the front or the back, it just kept wrinkling or bunching. I’m 5’6 and 120 pounds, and ordered a medium based on reviews. The size actually fit very well for the most part, just the issues already mentioned."
2.0,After one wash the color completely faded
2.0,Kept falling apart...
2.0,"The look of the hat is super cute, but the fit is very weird. It seems there's too much fabric on the front of the hat under the lettering, creating a lumpy look. Unfortunately, I'll be returning this."
2.0,"Quality is not good. It is a flimsy shirt with uneven hems. I ordered a small (32 inch chest) based on reviews, and it is too big. Just hangs, no shape."
2.0,Nice glasses and cool design but poorly made. The crossbar broke off in the first 48 hours. I was hoping to get at least a few weeks of wear out of these.
2.0,one of the socks was damaged with a hole right out of the package.  not overly impressed with the quality out of the gate but time will tell how well they will last.  style wise they are an awesome no show that don't show with boat shoes or other low shoes.
2.0,I like these but I still haven't been able to get any into my nose!
2.0,Didn't fit and no return policy? WTF
2.0,The clasp doesn't stay shut.
2.0,Huge. Gave one away. Ordered one size smaller. Still roomy.
2.0,I ordered a large and I am 5'8 160. The tummy area is pretty tight. The lace is really good quality.
2.0,Very uncomfortable to wear. But seems like it could offer decent protection
2.0,cant see it very well in subdued lighting
2.0,"Definitely ran small. I had to return unfortunately. Make sure to size up and it would be a great, comfy shirt."
2.0,I purchased 100 white and 100 black cord locks. I received 100 black and 50 whites. The bag on the white said it had 100 pieces.Nope not 100 pieces.
2.0,Fit is quite large. And it makes my already broad shoulders look like I'm wearing football gear.
2.0,"Fabric is ""stretchy but in all the wrong ways. Too small in general and too big in other ways."
2.0,Grabs.  Too small.  The elastic too tight at the legs.  Unflattering
2.0,"Too big, felt as if I was swimming in it. Returned."
2.0,The sizing is all wrong.  I bought the size 44 and they said that the shoe should equate to a 10.5 or 11.  Nope. The size 44 is more like a size 9!
2.0,Really low quality but they're cute.
2.0,Looks nice  but Not the highest quality for materials. Compass is useless
2.0,"I didn’t like how they looked when I took them out of the box and the hoop wasn’t the size I was looking for. The food and chain style is nice, but the white trim does not look good."
2.0,Quality was ok and size was not too accurate. It took a long time to arrive.
2.0,Initially it was a very Nice coat great material however the zipper breaks easily and there aren't any snaps or velcro as back up. So the coat is useless.
2.0,"I was in love with 😍 it at first sight! …. But then, it broke within the very 1st week of wearing it. No, I did not run it into anything. No, I was not rough with it while wearing it. It was for casual wear only, but unfortunately, once it stretches out, it does not just go back and tighten up!? It would only keep stretching, and let me just add, I’ve got some very tiny small wrists! It didn’t take long before it completely broke. I was so unhappy 🙁. I’d love it if they would show some initiative by sending me one that is new and not already used and too stretched out?  Then, I’ll be able to do the 5 star review I wanted to give to begin with! Once I get the right one I ordered sent back to me, which was new and not “used”, I’ll finally be able to wear it without it sliding off my wrists, being too far stretched out, etc."
2.0,Wherever they make these great looking pants need to get realistic large sizes correct. The material feels great and the style looks fantastic.  But are extremely small.
2.0,"I'm a size 4. This item is too small and had to be returned. The item was so small, in fact, that even the laces were not long enough to accomodate how wide the belt needed to be stretched. With no stretch, the belt has a 7""-8"" gap in between the two pieces. The belt stretches, of course, but it was too much to be comfortable.  Belt appeared to be made well, zipper seemed sturdy. The tie itself is 48"" long and made of a soft leather type material."
2.0,"Its not like the picture showed, I like a hat that has some air space on top of your head. This one is not what I excepted. Oh well just keep looking. Thanks Jim"
2.0,"The fabric was much thinner than I expected and a bit scratchy (not combed cotton at all). The straps also don't seem as though they'd hold up over time and would probably just get easily stretched out of shape over time. For a few dollars more, I purchased another dress of a different brand/style that had better quality cotton fabric that felt and looked better than this dress. I wanted to like this, but didn't and decided to return it."
2.0,"The link holding it to the ornament was bent open but I doubt it happened in transit because it was cushioned really well. Whoever had it before packaging had to have damaged it and sent it anyway, Thanks Mr. &#34;Oh well, it's just a job!&#34;"
2.0,I find these cubes to be cheap and flimsy. Would not buy again but I love packing cubes.
2.0,"It was super soft and comfortable, but the seam on the right sleeve. But I just sewed it. I think it was still worth it to be honest"
2.0,Cheap. Threading coming undone after having for 3 months.
2.0,It is comfortable but size though I requested large it was small
2.0,"When I first recieved this product, I thought it was a great product for the price it cost. I started using it February 1st. The ability to change the tightness was not difficult and it was secure. The comfort was great. Unfortunately after using the band for 1 1/2 months, it started to fall apart. The band itself started unraveling. Since the band is made of metal, when it unraveled, it created very sharp edges that would get caught on clothes. It would also get stuck on my finger and cut it. I continued to use it because it was my only band. The locking mechanism then just randomly stopped latching and the now the band is completely unusable. It lasted longer than band that came with the watch did! This band had potential, but unfortunately has too low of quality."
2.0,Loved the way they looked but HUGE not toddler size at all
2.0,"So disappointed. I really wanted to love this. I ordered this in a large (pink). I ordered down a size since many of the reviews said it ran a bit big.I I was looking for a nice light shirt to wear in the sweltering summers here. The material IS light... and transparent. I could see every line of my bra and exactly where my jeans started... and the pockets and individual belt loops on said jeans. It wasn't all bad though. The loose fit was great and forgiving of my fat rolls and covered the junk in my trunk nicely. This is asymmetrical so it's a bit longer in the back than the front (the front is 28.5 inches long and the back is 32 inches)  The neckline was nice and high. No risk of flashing innocent bystanders and scarring them for life. It was really comfy too, but I wanted something I could wear in public, so it unfortunately has to go back."
2.0,The neckline is awkward and the fabric is cheap. The dress wasn’t necessarily too small- it fit but the zipper in the back would come down every time I moved my arms. I returned mine.
2.0,This nose ring is cute but the lotus is not a cut out as shown in the picture which was disappointing. Not quite as dainty looking as the the display photo.
2.0,"does not look like picture, although neither do I!"
2.0,"I was excited to get this, but disappointed when I did. The color was what I was looking for- more of a gold than a yellow, but the material is very thin and see through!!<br />Sizing is definitely an issue. I normally wear a 6 so according to the sizing charts, a medium should of fit. Nope. I could of ordered an X Large easily to have it button comfortably and fit across the shoulder!<br />Ughhh. Returning is such a pain and I really like the style! The sleeves are so cute, and the buttons add a lot to the style! So I’m going to move the waste buttons, and find a nude slip to wear underneath . Also the length is long so I will need to hem it. (I am 5-3)"
2.0,I made sure I ordered charms with correct measurements and these do not measure correctly although they are cute they are not measured right and do not fit what I needed them for.
2.0,"The little poker was so hard to use. I punctured my finger first of all and second of all didn't even get it to the right size for my worst because the stupid thing broke while trying to take one of the pins out. If I could take them out more easily, this product would be a solid 5 stars, but it's too loose for my wrist now and I'm not sure how to fix the size. VERY disappointed."
2.0,"Bought it for my 10 year old granddaughter who loves mermaids.  She liked it, but the silver finish looks distressed or tarnished."
2.0,did not last long
2.0,"Returned it, too tight."
2.0,"These shirts definitely are not true to size, they run small for sure.  I feel like Chris Farley about to flex."
2.0,Fun shoe but runs at least one size too small.
2.0,Okay for price but more like pantyhose
2.0,"It's a very nice looking case but it won't close with a phone AND several cards.<br />It can hold a Blackberry and maybe a driver's license and one credit card, but that is it.<br />Could not use it consequently.  Disappointed. My daughter now uses it as a toy."
2.0,I like the design BUT these are some small socks. They don’t go high at ALL. If it wasn’t for the fact that my kids like the design I’d return them.
2.0,Shirts looked good and fit fine but everyone i tried on had an overwhelming smell of sweat. But sure what that's about
2.0,"This was a nicely made handbag, and arrived in a timely fashion, however the color was Oxblood, NOT purple.  I returned it."
2.0,"Cute and practical but the sizing is off - I went bigger than I thought I needed, so my kids had room to grow, but they JUST fit. My kids won't get through the summer without needing to go up another size."
2.0,"Even though I ordered a small, it still was too big for what I was picturing. In the photo and some other reviews it looked small enough to land right at my pants line but it actually goes to my thighs. I am 5’5” and 125lbs and I got a small. It’s also a little itchy. I’m slightly allergic to wool and acrylic so maybe this has some of that in it. Only 2 materials that make my skin feel itchy. Will be returning. I’m super sad about it because I love the colors so I bought green and black!! And I’d like the fit if it was the fit I was looking for. I already have plenty of large sweaters, I need some shorter ones."
2.0,Came with a hole on the arm😢
2.0,Good quality... but order a size or 2 up or it won't be wearable.
2.0,"The bra seems like it we would work. The bra is heavy so when sticking its a bit awkward and heavy. It doesn't seem to stick upwards but almost drags down, feeling heavy."
2.0,"So the color on the red is more orangy bright red so I was a bit disapointed... I may return it... it is soooo comfy. Its a little big in the band and cups but not significantly so... just a smidge.<br /><br />Update: after looking at this the next day Ive decided indeed it is going back. The part that adjusts the straps is PLASTIC and for the price this is unacceptable and cheap. I can get better at walmart. A shame. With the sizing issue, color being off and cheap parts... I just dont want anything to do with it comfy or not how many things are gonna be off with this?"
2.0,The hat does not fit my head. It’s very tiny. I have a lot of hair. Quality of products is good otherwise.
2.0,"I've been consistently wearing these since I got them a year ago. I wish they'd come back so I could order more. But within my first week of wearing them, a pair had the waistband start to separate from the material. A month in, 3/5 pairs had holes under the waistbands. They are SO comfortable, but they came apart too easily. I shouldn't need to sew my boxers up week by week. A year in and they are still my favorite, but some pairs have holes and are literally unwearable."
2.0,"When I received this watch, I loved the way it looked. All of the dials on the face functioned properly and you could see the gears spinning through the little window under the dial and on the back (wrist) side of the watch. All of that was fascinating and I was showing it off the first couple of days that I wore it. BUT...day after day I could not accurately tell what time it was because it would lose anywhere from 5-10 minutes every hour, and that's even when I would wind it 2+ times every day and once right before I went to bed. Continuously throughout the day I would have to reset the time because it had fallen behind, and what the heck is the point of a watch that doesn't keep accurate time? I hate to say this, but this was the first product I have purchased on Amazon that I have actually returned.<br /><br />If you decide to get this watch, be prepared to either wind and reset the time throughout the day, or simply not have an accurate time every time you look at it."
2.0,Looks way better in the picture than in real person. Disappointing.
2.0,It was ok!!!!
2.0,"I have chunky thighs, not huge thighs, but they are chunky.  I ordered these and they are just like the knee high tights you buy at any store, they were way too tight and didn't seem like they would stay up.  Returning item."
2.0,very large the bracelet!
2.0,The red was more like orange and the fabric reminded me of a jersey.
2.0,Nose pieces broke off after multiple uses
2.0,"PROS: It's pretty cute and looks exactly like the picture.<br /><br />CONS: The bust was loose, and the cup size at LEAST a D and maybe larger.  Not only could I not dive without flashing the world, I couldn't even swim a lap, because the water pushed in the top and, again, flashing.  Also, the ruching does nothing to slim you, because the fabric is so cheap and flimsy it doesn't hold you in at all.<br /><br />If you're at least a D-cup, pretty trim, and don't plan to do any serious swimming, this might work for you.  Otherwise, skip."
2.0,"Delivery was on time but in a grossly oversize box that was smashed in shipping.<br /><br />The item itself is smaller than pictured and will easily fit most small women.<br />Unfortunately, its manufacture is poor and its edges are nicked and chipped in places.<br /><br />The ""case"" it came it was a cheap pink mesh bag like party treats would come in.<br />It offers no protection at all and may have contributed to it being nicked.<br />Also, the ziplock bag it was all placed in with its UPC code looked like it went thru WW 2.<br /><br />Perhaps if handled properly and shipped carefully, it would be a nice piece of costume jewelry.<br />But as is, its relegated to the ""junk"" jewelry drawer."
2.0,"Was not happy with this product at all!! It was way to small especially for the price i paid, not the average duffle bag like i thought it was. However the shipping time frame was great, got here within a couple days!!"
2.0,"I've had coats for many many years before they go bad and I have to get a new one. I've had this coat ONE winter, and it has already torn."
2.0,This shirt is super cute but unfortunately too small. I wear a large but this shirt fit more as a medium.
2.0,One broke immediately. The rest of them are holding up well I don’t use them as much as I thought I would. Massaging your own hand or having someone else massage it is a better way to relieve tension but if that’s not an option I’d recommend these!<br />Apart from the one that broke (it was at the seem) I’d say the metal is decent quality.
2.0,These were way bigger than what they appeared to be in the picture - they were almost as big as ones ear.
2.0,"the frame is made of shiny plastic material that looks and feel cheap. like some of the reviews already stated, it was bent out of shape and does not sit properly on your face."
2.0,Should have sent it back! Way to small
2.0,"Very cute,  fair quality but a large fit way too small,  I wear a large no size tag on vest. Darn, wish it fit!"
2.0,Material was terrible looks amazing online in person it looks like something pulled out of an attic from a century ago
2.0,"Terrible fabric. Too long, not well made. Poor fit."
2.0,Shrink and not as comfy as some other brand options.
2.0,Kind of cheezy. Lt weight. What did I expect for 12 bucks?
2.0,"Too small, gave it to my son. The fabric is sort stiff not soft and fluffy"
2.0,"Beautiful earrings.  Light weight and very pretty, however the clasp got stuck on one of the earrings and it took 10 minutes to get it off.  Sore earlobe. Sent them back."
2.0,Way too small for the average male head (both in width and length of the side pieces).  These seem to be sized more for women than men.  I gave them to by 12 year old daughter and they sit her perfectly!
2.0,Not forgiving because its rayon.
2.0,Cute but if you're bigger than a B cup the Large size will be too small still
2.0,These headbands are okay but not made of great material and are too tight for my normal size head. Will not repurchase.
2.0,"Really cheap. Fabric feels weird. Not what I was expecting. Weird fit, I thought I was wearing them backwards because they seemed low in the back and high in the front. Apparently they didn’t plan on people wearing to have a butt!"
2.0,The yoga fit  at all but not the dresses  there  to small and thats my size i don't  know  why they come too smallest
2.0,for me was too big and its CLIPS!
2.0,I waited so long for this suit and am so disappointed now.  First its cute !  totally however the top is LONGER than the  photo shows (more like a swim dress) second the shorts are SUPER SHORT not what the photo shows.  I have other suits but this looked perfect for excursions where a short would be more appropriate.  I am debating what to do.  Take the top and get it altered shorter and buy another pair of more appropriate shorts or just send it back .. The shorts have a very tiny inseam -think boyshort underwear NOT shorts as pictured.
2.0,You'll probably get to wear them once. The drawstring holes seems like it's going to stretch and I was only trying them on.
2.0,"I really wanted this swimsuit to work because the pattern and design are very cute but the fit is horrible. I ordered a larger size because I have a large chest. Because of that, the bottoms were huge and the top still didn't fit. The cups are very small compared to the size of the suit. I was completely falling out of it. If they made these in bra sizes and sold the bottoms separate, this may be a winner but thE way it is is awful."
2.0,"This top fits nice with the exception of the neckline.  The neckline is almost to the tip of my shoulders and allows bra straps to show.  Advertised as ""round neck"".  It should read.... Very large round neck.  Will be returning this item."
2.0,"I wasn't looking for a tight bathing suit cover, but the way this fell on me made me look pregnant."
2.0,"Doesn't fit like they say. Short if you're over 5'7""."
2.0,The frame is crooked.
2.0,"I purchased this bracelet because it specifically states Fathers day gift. Even after thorough investigation prior to purchasing this item, I was not expecting the joke I received in the mail. Now if this was a bracelet for a female then I would write that the product seems nice yet some what cheap with the shiny &#34;diamond looking&#34; ball in the middle. I am/was super disappointed in this purchase."
2.0,"They slide everywhere , very cute but don’t work for working out or regular wear . They honestly slide back all the time"
2.0,I like the jeans.  They are just cheaply made.
2.0,"Product came in a neat case for storage, and the googles looked great. Was a great set of polarized goggles...until I took one fall and the goggles' lens cracked and split from the lower base of the frame. Wasn't a violent fall either. I've had 4 different goggles over the years and have never had this happen. I had an extra pair on this trip, but this happened day 2 of a 4 day snowboarding trip. Was very disappointed in the product and reverted back to some old Scott goggles I had just happened to bring. Poorly made product."
2.0,Love them. Hate that they tarnish so fast. You cannot wear them for extended periods of time. You must take them off and not hey then wet.
2.0,"I previously ordered these earrings and loved them. After wearing a few months, one broke, didn’t bother me because I definitely got $5 worth of wear out of them. I loved them so much I got right online to order a new pair. This time I ordered black (like my original purchase), and white. When they arrived, the white are exactly the same size as my first pair, but the black were about half the size. I’m extremely disappointed as I liked them for their larger size and no where does it state the size has changed or that the black option is now smaller than the other colors."
2.0,Wore it two days and then it broke.
2.0,"Shirt is cute, but I ordered the red and it is NOT red. It is a deep pink. It will be going back. Also, I would definitely recommend ordering a size up."
2.0,The material is very light and see through and it didn't survive a single wash.
2.0,No issues I like it but I only tried it I will let u know how it holds up in water and being washed.<br /><br />update.  wore it one time and it started coming apart.
2.0,First off the picture in the ad did match the shoes I got. Secondly they are not comfortable and finally my old Crocs have more support
2.0,This shirt is very wide and shrunk to half its length after 1 wash.
2.0,"The cut was fine, but that was the only acceptable thing about these. The fabric is slightly thicker than the mesh hospital underwear you get after delivering a baby. It was extremely thin with no added layering in the crotch. They appear to be thicker or sportier in the online picture. Add to this that a panty liner will not adhere to this fabric so there's no way to stay dry down there. They're very impractical for that reason and I'm returning them."
2.0,I would save your money and spend more on a better made pair. These are cheaply made and broke within the first week of using them.
2.0,I did like fabric and it was too big.  I’d like to return it but there was no instructions for teturns
2.0,"It's thinner, and narrower than I expected...and built to a little smaller tolerances than the quick connect bars, so it rattles a bit when I move my arm too fast."
2.0,"when the necklace came the package was pretty and it looked really nice. but after wearing it for only a few days the chain turned my neck green and the silver was already coming off of the pendant. I wouldn't purchase this again, next time around I would spend a little more to get something that doesn't turn my neck green."
2.0,"I'm short-waisted with big boobs, this looked perfect for me. I can't put my finger on it, it just isn't flattering so it's a No for me (missed return window, I'll give this away)."
2.0,"I wear a large. I'm 5'3&#34;, 170 lbs, 34D, Bust 41, Waist 35 and Hips 43. The hem line comes just below my knee. It is made well. The fabric is heavy, stretchy and fairly comfortable. It flattered my curves and hid my stomach... if I was standing still. I loved the Navy Blue color. It looked just as it appeared online. I wore it with tights, a black Petticoat to fill out the dress and a black Bolero, see product links below. However the empire waist was such that it kept riding up, so the seam sat directly across the middle of my chest. I made several attempts to pull it down but it would just ride back up again. I noticed other reviewers had the same experience. And the sleeves were puffy. I was extremely disappointed and I have only worn it once. I put it through the delicate cycle on the washing machine and it held up great but I have no plans to wear it any time soon. I only paid $21.99, so I got what I paid for.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01EWL84ZA Innabella Women 80 Den Microfiber Soft Opaque Tights (Black)]]<br />[[ASIN:B011RJ03G8 Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt Petticoat Black(L)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00XXVCV32 MUXXN Women's Vintage Cardigan Bolero Knitting Shrug (Black L)]]"
2.0,"Purchased these shoes for my daughter to wear on Halloween. They were so cute and perfect for her alien Halloween costume. Everything seemed great. I charged them according to directions. One shoe stopped lighting up within 5 minutes. The other shoe made it about 3 houses before quitting. A complete letdown for a 6 yr old on Halloween. Now the first shoe won't hold a charge while the other holds for a few minutes. They are cute, comfy shoes without the lighting though."
2.0,"I have normal sized feet (size 8), and these socks are so tiny it’s ridiculous! I appreciate the attempt to be minimal for the purposes of not showing when wearing flats, but they continuously slip off my heel throughout the day. They are better than not wearing anything, but I certainly would not buy these again nor recommend them to anyone else."
2.0,Hairs were coming out of the wig. Not a good purchase. I returned it
2.0,"These were very cute and look very nice, as pictured. But as for barefoot shoes, they have too much arch support to qualify. My feet are used to true barefoot shoes, and these were super uncomfortable. If you are used to arch support, you may love them. But I had to return them."
2.0,They looked cute. I was happy with them for a couple weeks.  They didn't hold up well and started to smell like pet urine as well! (We don't have pets and the shoes weren't around any either)
2.0,"Yellow fabric is a bit thin, shows all imperfections rather than smoothing them out like some of the others."
2.0,Once u put on hard to get off! And broke quick
2.0,"Even my yougest daughter, age 9 could not wear these since they were too small. Very nice looking but didn't fit anyone. We tried to stretch them out but they did not work."
2.0,Just liked two of them.i mostly like cheap stuff but this one wasn't worth any penny.
2.0,most did not work
2.0,"I found these shorts to fit a bit strangely. The waistband was a little tight (but I could tell if I sized up they would be too large) but the shorts themselves felt a bit too baggy and the crotch area seemed to extend down very low giving the shorts an odd look overall. For reference, I'm 5'5"" tall and around 136lbs and ordered a medium. I will be returning these."
2.0,"I have pretty significant foot swelling. I love the look of the shoe but they feel incredibly heavy to me and that is tough on a sore foot. Also, the heal of the food does not situate so its almost more like a flip flop which will definitely cause those with plantar fasciitis issues. I am going to give them a try but I am not looking forward to disappointment."
2.0,Not quite what is pictured. No verse or writing . Also not the corner edging on them also as pictured
2.0,"I rrrreeaaallly wanted to love this shirt, but it was absolutely too small around the chest and the material was very hard and scratchy... I ended up returning it. Cute idea though."
2.0,"Was a nice case at first, but after 2 months the lining by the magnet closure came loose. Now it is very hard to open the case. I only open this once a day to store my glasses on the nightstand over night, so very light use. Disappointed in quality. Now a few days later, the lining has come away from about 1/2 of the case. There is a metal strip that just flops down."
2.0,I agree with the reviews  but I was not so lucky  The first time I wanted to use it the pin fell off But I will try again They are pretty
2.0,"These shoes are cute, but undependable in sizing.  I ordered same style and size in 2 different colors. The fist,pair fit, but the second pair were too small. I bought a shoe strecher to try and make them fit. They don't have half sizes and the next size up are too big."
2.0,"Shirt is a dri-fit and the print will come off after 2nd wash-dry, so hang dry"
2.0,"Years ago, I had slippers with a slot on the top outside of a bootie style, that had a microwaveable heat pad for each foot. I had hoped these would be a good replacement. Unfortunately you really can’t walk in these because of the bizarre design choice to put the heating pad in the bottom of the shoe. They are huge (I’m an 8.5-9) and so awkward to walk in. If you’re sick or wearing these exclusively while reclining, they might be ok. I was looking for something to wear as I moved through my drafty house in the chilly months, and this wasn’t it. I wouldn’t even wear them across the room to go make tea because I didn’t want to trip with hot stuff. If I can’t make tea in my slippers, it’s ruining my hygge! If the company would consider the top loading style, I think it would be better, and allow for sizes too!"
2.0,The material is not too nice and it's small around the hip. Had to make two side slits at the bottom to make it fit.
2.0,Love the dress but not true to size. Got XXL more like a size 7 or medium. Giving away as gift.
2.0,A little small may return them
2.0,It claims to be silver but I've worn it for less than a day and it's already turning my finger green.
2.0,Used twice and it stopped charging back up  modified to work with 16850 batter and now it has a 3 day play time
2.0,"I bought a large because I wanted to wear it around the house during the winter. I’m 5’8”, 134lbs.  The cardigan had an unpleasant smell, was very thin, poorly made and was snug on me. I usually buy a medium.  I returned it."
2.0,Was not impressed at all looked as if it was quickly ground out and put in a box
2.0,"The good: This is very good looking luggage. It has lots of pockets and holds more than you'd expect. The 360 degree rolling feature is very nice.<br /><br />The bad: After one trip out and back, there's a hole in the front pocket and one of the zipper pulls is broken off. The manufacturer says they are not responsible for ""improper handling or damage caused by a common carrier"" and the carrier, of course, doesn't care about my damaged luggage. So now I'm stuck with a brand new, very expensive piece of broken luggage. The 5-piece set that I got for $50 hasn't suffered this kind of damage after 6 years of use. I thought that more expensive luggage meant it would be more durable but it doesn't. You're just paying for the SwissGear name. Please don't waste your money on this luggage!"
2.0,Not like in picture!
2.0,Dissapointed.  I got both blue dice when the picture shows one maize and one blue.
2.0,"To start I do like the style and that was a nice factor in this but the reason I got the bracket was the effects of the bracket , not the style. The second day , things started to happen. The stones started to shed. AS in fall out.... I bought 2 brackets, one for each wrist. The stones really started to fall out on day three. So for Me,, the bracelet didn't stand up to at least one week."
2.0,Don’t like the sizing to sent back
2.0,"Poor quality trucker hat,  with loose stitching."
2.0,Super tiny - can’t wear!
2.0,"The boots fit fairly well at first and better once they broke in, however. I've used them for about a month and I'm already having I buy new boots due to the rhino boots falling apart. The sole of the boot is ripping off. The leather is practically all gone after a month. Since I've gotten them I've had a huge issue with the steel toes not staying in place and jamming into my feet when walking. I by no means am hard on these boots, I work in an automechanic shop, all I do is walk in these. Wish I had known what I was buying prior to. The reviews on Amazon I feel give people the wrong idea."
2.0,"Top is cute but the shorts are grey. The image shows black. The tankini straps are black and the colors are blue, white and black. Little disappointed that it doesn't match!"
2.0,"I had high hopes for this bag but I guess you get what you pay for. My main problem was that it is NOT 13&#34;*18&#34;*4.5&#34;. It measures 11&#34;*13&#34;*4. That is completely why I had to return it. I bought this bag because it advertised bigger than others like it. Outer material is decent but interior laptop pouch is flimsy. If you really put a laptop in (wouldn't fit mine), that pocket would likely rip."
2.0,"The top is cute, but too small (and short), order size up."
2.0,"Didn’t quite care for the material, made me feel like an senior citizen so i quickly returned"
2.0,This coat is way too small for a 2x large as marked and ordered.  I'm disgusted with it.
2.0,One of the earrings broke within an hour of wearing them.
2.0,Collar is huge -- doesn't lay flat like it should.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress as the pattern is so nice.  I am 5'3/115lbs/32DD and ordered a small.  Unfortunately the top was too small on me and I would of altered it to fit but the bottom was also very loose/baggy.  In addition, I really didn't like the quality of the material - despite the low price point it is very cheap looking polyester and I bet you would get hot and sweaty wearing it!"
2.0,"Not even CLOSE to looking as sexy in real life as in the pics. The lace up part barely opens, let alone look as it appears in the pics. And its REALLY long...but completely hangs straight down. I would just tuck it in and wear it like a boring flannel (except without ANY warmth), except it's so long that there are bulges everywhere from the fabric.<br />Dont fall for the pic."
2.0,I am 5'11 and weighing 300 lb. Size extra large was too tight and small. I can wear a size extra large tank top regular cotton fruit loom. These are not cotton they are a workout polyester material moisture wicking. It's it's a little silky and feels cool. The cut of the tank top is nice full exposure of shoulders and shoulder blades.
2.0,The proportions are off. It is very short and puffy. I'm 5'9&#34; usually a medium with everything and the bottom of the jacket is at my waist line exposing my belt. If I get a large it will fit too loosely because I weigh 135lbs.
2.0,Order a size larger for my son. Shrunk to be to small on him the first wash. Even washed in cold water. Cute but can only wear once.
2.0,"I was disappointed that this doesn’t fit as pictured.  The waistline is absurdly high for me, and I usually don’t have an issue with how clothing is cut.  I’ll save it for maternity wear, as it would be a nice sweatshirt if it weren’t cut so strangely."
2.0,Did not like them.. hurts to much when you take them off.
2.0,It just fits weird.
2.0,"Material felt cheep, uncomfortable fit, hard to zip. Thought it would be good for my curvy body but it wasn’t."
2.0,Nice color and quality. Size runs small. Should have went up a size.
2.0,"Shoes are very cute.  But it had really strong smell, like mens colonge. I assumed they used some kida perfume thing to eliminate the plastic odor, but not sure what. Its been a couple of months from the purchase so its almost gone, but it was super strong smell!!"
2.0,Ok item. Couldn't really feel any positive energies coming from them like I have other chakra items I've purchased in the past. Didn't have negative either. So it didn't have desired effect. Otherwise item seemed to have ok quality.
2.0,Too tight and its hard to get fingers inside gloves
2.0,Pretty color. Hard to connect straps. Not ok god.
2.0,Took a month to arrive and comes off easily. But it was only a few dollars wasted so no biggie
2.0,Great looking graphics - absolutely fantastic looking. The fabric just doesn’t allow your skin to breathe. Feels like wearing a tight plastic shirt. Ended up giving it away. Unfortunate really.
2.0,Just was not what is shown here.
2.0,Bottoms fit great but the top is terrible. So small and no cups.
2.0,Does not look like the picture. It is more white than beigey/tan and has stripes of blue in it.
2.0,only bought this because it said it was cotton. but it says 95% polyester.  no me gusta polyester! :(
2.0,"This is the second time I have purchased this product, the first time I got the jean version. The jeans were nice and a good quality but these khakis for some reason are very poor quality. After one wear they were tearing inbetween the leg a little bit. But they are very comfortable!"
2.0,I bought the red dress and received it and it got well and was comfortable but I noticed on the collar seem it was stitched with white thread no big deal for the price but then I washed it and all of the elastic in the waste is starting to come out. I've only wore it once so it is very disappointing.
2.0,"Socks feel so tight I can barely get my hand inside.  I'm afraid of putting them on my feet, if I even could!"
2.0,Not sure why anyone would use noisy plastic as a pocket liner
2.0,These look nice but unfortunately slide right off my child’s head / hair.
2.0,"At first, I loved this. Then I washed it two times. It was obvious I got what I paid for."
2.0,My son could not get his hands all the way in as the straps are too tight. I tried them myself as I have small hands. They are very uncomfortable.
2.0,"When I first put these on, they felt great. I wore them to my shift at a gym. With my movement they kept sliding down and I discovered a small hole had formed halfway through my first shift."
2.0,My fault shorter than i expected..
2.0,"Beautiful dress, fit didn’t make me love it!"
2.0,"This had the potential to be cute. I ordered an XL (when I normally wear a M/L) and it fit like a XS/S. Also! NOT good for big busted girls! I wear a 36DDD and the crop top barely covered my bust (and I mean barely!). The material of the bottoms were good, the shirt was a bit itchy. Overall, just disappointed. If you're small, buy two sizes up and it might work."
2.0,Two have already broken before even leaving the house to wear them out...
2.0,Loses the silver turns bronze
2.0,"The dress was not as pictured. Instead of a V neck, it had a mock turtleneck, which I found unflattering on me. While it fit well in the shoulders and arms, it was huge elsewhere, and I felt like I was wearing a tent. I also found the fabric to be a bit scratchy, although it was nice and thick and hung well. It went back."
2.0,"Did not like the material, too flimsy"
2.0,I found this a one time use glove. The battery or the heating element are done for after one wearing. Good while it works but the inability to recharge the battery makes it not something that I can recommend.
2.0,Sent back. Shoulders don't look like the picture. the opening at top is too small to slide off 1 shoulder. This color is just not right for me.
2.0,&#34;Pearls&#34; too big for my taste and bigger than they look in the picture. Metal parts look cheap.
2.0,Really dark. I was almost inable to walk through crowds.
2.0,"It said it was a piccolo cork, but it was a flute cork. Way too big. Not what I wanted. It came fairly quickly though."
2.0,Poor quality... start having holes after couple wash.
2.0,When l  washed it became small.
2.0,The ends flop all over and knots don't stay in place
2.0,Way too small. My 15 yr old daughter is wearing them but they were super soft. I'm a 18/20 5'7&#34;.
2.0,Little see Thru and arms and chest area a little snug. Wore it for Halloween we were little Red riddinghood (daughter) I was Rwandan in this and my husband was the lumberjack wolf! Gave it away to friend and she loves it! Has to be ironed. It served its purpose.
2.0,Uncomfortable;  not sure if I will donate to charity or discard or wear for a while until I get another pair.<br />Maybe the product will work for others.
2.0,"This dress did not fit well at all. The mid line did not hit at a flattering place (too low near the hips) and made me look super wide. The skirt portion was excessively wide and it felt like there was way too much material. The top was adorable but the bust was not proportional to the waist (it seemed like it was meant for a very large chested person with a very tiny waist). I ordered a small and I'm 34B, 5'5"", 119 pounds"
2.0,"These were pretty cheap material,  and a little small. Alright for play I suppose"
2.0,construction is fine but the horns are mounted super asymmetrically. it's not super noticeable when you're wearing the hat but it's super obvious when you look at it from the top.
2.0,I don't know on what planet this is L/XL?! Maybe a mislabeled bra? If it fit I feel like it would be great.
2.0,"Well, I was optimistic about these being photochromatic, but alas, I was disappointed.<br />My lenses do not shift or get darker even in extremely sunny conditions.  Its a shame because the frame is excellent and really comfortable."
2.0,The fabric looks like shower curtain  I'm disappointed!
2.0,I bought my regular size socks for 7 1/2 to 8 women's and these were too big and bunched up at the bottom of my heel...everyone noticed. Not impressed 😕
2.0,I think I recieved a bad batch.. Some of the adjustable straps are not able to be adjusted because the other part was not fed thru... There were a few that did not have this problem however I can't recommend and will not purchase again due to this flaw. I wish I could contact the seller but I cannot find a way.
2.0,"I had to return the first one because it would not keep time. It would randomly stop and then start again. My second one broke too easily. Yes I did knock it against a shelf but I really don't think it should have broken from that. I wanted to reach out to the company to see if they might consider a return for the 2nd watch. Instead, Amazon just approved a free return which I was not expecting. I'll probably order a 3rd since it was a Christmas gift from my daughter.<br /><br />Overall it is a nice looking watch for the price. Also, quite comfortable to wear compared to my other watches."
2.0,It's OK...
2.0,"Size 7 women's, size 5.5 men's. These felt a little long and unfortunately did not provide the compression relief I was hoping for. Ended up returning."
2.0,Too much wind gets in.
2.0,"very cheaply made, zipper doesn't glide, permanent dent in material"
2.0,Runs very small.<br />Buy at least 2 inches beyond your normal waist size.<br />It appears Asian sizing  parameters were used.
2.0,"After a month, the color started coming off."
2.0,"The Fabric is very Warm and Comfortable,<br />But I Ordered an Extra Large which 9 times out of 10 is perfect for me... The Pants are too Long and I'm stepping on the cuffs on top of that the Shirt is too Tight!! WTF???"
2.0,"Far too narrow, gave them away."
2.0,"Not sure why these have such great reviews. They are not very high waisted on me and are way way too tight! Not flattering at all. I'm 5'10'' and 160 lbs, wear a size 6 in lululemon aligns, and these hit me two inches below my belly button and compress my waist in a very unflattering way. Size up and don't get if you're tall and want them to be above your belly button."
2.0,The product is listed as surgical steel. I have only worn the product for 1 week and the middle flower piece is turning green and my belly button is now infected.
2.0,"Loved the look, but the frame has broken after a short period of time using it."
2.0,Fits ugly and big
2.0,Kinda big they slip down a lot and are shorter than I expected I’m only 5’5” and they don’t touch the ground..
2.0,Do not stay on
2.0,I was expecting something better based on the online feedback. Not worth $15 for a black plastic box. Doesn't look all that cheap but doesn't look luxurious as how other users said. Mine also had white spots and scratches on the front.
2.0,"I bought this item in October and by January some of the paint had started coming off the beads and one side of the lanyard had started coming apart. I'm disappointed because its very pretty and I really do like it, but it didn't last very long at all. I would not recommend this lanyard."
2.0,"I got my correct size, small, and it was so short. Im 5'6, 115, and it felt like a fitted tshirt, baggy armsleeves, and baggy stomach. however the material is super soft. I returned it."
2.0,"They are comfy, but if you have a bigger booty they are uncomfortable... they ride up sooo I would buy a size up and see if you like them."
2.0,The stone in the bottom turn a weird color after about two weeks. I’m not sure if the color wore off or what happened. Top stone still beautiful. Black color is nice.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress... the fabric is not the best, the cut made me look large.. It was a little bigger than expected. I do like the pockets.. but the rest of the dress was not up to par. The flower patterns was also a bit... too much. I got the black one and the pink was just.. to &#34;fake&#34; looking.."
2.0,"This dress was a major disappointment. It was 1) huge and tent-like (I ordered my normal size); 2) made with very thin fabric (the white fabric is totally see-through) and 3) a different cut than what is shown in the photos.<br /><br />Take a look at the sleeves in the advertised photo, and the ones in my photo. They aren't anything alike, and the ones on the dress I received just made the dress look...not cute at all. This is a pet peeve of mine, when sellers sell knock-offs and copycats of other brands and use photos of other designers' designs to try to pass them off as their own.<br /><br />The dress looks cheap in design and quality and is not cute by any stretch of the imagination. Would not recommend."
2.0,I normally need a 2.75 to 3.00 strength and everything was blurry with these. They are not comparable to my regular readers at the same strength. They were very cute but didn't work for me.
2.0,Color was cute but material was too thin and felt cheap
2.0,They are way too big for a person with size 11 and too thick especially for summer use.
2.0,I loved these pants at first. They are light and comfortable but the waist band continually rolls up. And worst of all the seams in every part of the pants just bursts at the slightest bend.  Unfortunately they are unwearable.
2.0,"I purchased this because it said it was a cotton blend and I’m picky about my fabrics. Unfortunately it’s not- it’s made out of cheap, sheer rayon. This went straight back."
2.0,"Never have I tried on bike pants with such a wide chammie.  Yuck, can't walk in them without spreading legs wide to compensate for all the extra stuff folded under there.  That makes them want to hang low too.  Why is it so wide in the center?  Much wider than the space between any legs, wider than my hand, much wider than bike saddle.  Completely unnecessary!  The entire pad is so wide that when standing, it sticks out and makes me look like I have male parts, and a diaper butt.  Then the fabric is thin, definitely not compression fabric, but just like cheap run tights.  Definitely not made by serious cyclists or for serious cyclists.  Too bad, as the color is nice."
2.0,My wife wears S-M size and it was extremely big.
2.0,"I suppose I misread the description and I do not believe the ball chain is stainless either. After a week, the chain turned me green and the finish on the charm is peeling off. I guess you get what you pay for but I would not recommend it."
2.0,"I'm afraid I'm disappointed in these slipper/socks... The elastic on the top is very restrictive, and I bought these for my Mom, who has very vulnerable and damaged feet.  The elastic will have to be clipped to work for her. Also, they are pretty flimsy... I wouldn't buy them again."
2.0,"The dress was very large and fit me somewhat lopsided. I ordered a size small and I'm 5'5"" and 125lbs and I feel like I would've needed a size smaller if it existed.  I wasn't too thrilled with the many hanging threads and unraveling hems all over,  esp along the bottom. The material was decent and comfortable, but it's just poorly constructed and obviously cheaply made. It wasn't super expensive when I purchased it, altho I still think I overpaid for what I received.. I ended up using it as a comfy loose night gown to sleep in and do stuff around the house in, like clean lol."
2.0,"Top fit is very odd.  The underwire does not surround the entire cup area.  I had already already decided to keep it, so after much manipulation of the wire I was able to get it to look relatively normal.  Also criss-crossing the straps in back improved the fit, but also made it extremely difficult to keep them adjusted properly.  The ties on the bottoms came off in the first wash (inside a lingerie bag.) Before I even wore it, other than to try on,  the attachment loops for the top’s straps tore open and almost off in two places.  I had to see them back on.  And then it was about impossible to keep the straps attached even after pinching them closed with a pair of pliers. Also the top runs big and the bottoms small (36 DD, size 10-12)  This is exactly the opposite problem that I normally have!  I still gave it 2 stars because despite these things, the design is cute and it is made of a thick, quality fabric and is lined."
2.0,But kinda cool all the same.
2.0,5’10” / 150lbs / ordered xl<br /><br />Much thinner than expected and not very soft. Returning.
2.0,"I didn't realize my petite 4 year old girl had such large head until this. Definitely for the petite headed princess. And, this is very heavy. Small head need to wear for size, large head needed to keep it up with that weight. Good quality, but I would pass."
2.0,"The product arrived in time.  Fits as expected, however the material is cheap and the stitches came off within a 2 month period with 5 days of  wear."
2.0,Didn't love it. Fast shipping.
2.0,These were huge on my 2 year old and kept falling off.
2.0,"I like the &#34;style&#34; of the dress however, the material is bad. Lots of polyester. I tried the dress on and it looked nice but almost instantly started to feel hot and suffocated. I live in CA and there's no way I would be able to wear this dress."
2.0,"I did not like the way this cardigan fit me. It was long in the front, but super short in the back. I decided to return it. Also, the patterns aren't exactly the same as the one that the model is wearing. Be careful when purchasing. I usually wear a size medium but got a size large because it is asian sizing but it was still too short in the back."
2.0,I have  flattering shape and this dress made me look like a box. Even with a wrap belt. its long and just flat.
2.0,I ordered a XL and the shirt is more like a medium. Back it went!
2.0,Bought a 2X I’m a size 16 but I have a G cup and this was way too tight.
2.0,"Cute but teeny tiny. If you wear a medium, maybe an XL will fit. Returned."
2.0,"After two years, using it occasionally I must say that the watch has not been able to withstand the passage of time correctly, the chronograph system is already faulty."
2.0,The bodice is too short
2.0,It looks great and fits great but my white sheets became grey after I was sleeping on them in this nightshirt  :( not good
2.0,"The photographs are misleading. The material has inexpensive cotton appearance. The shirt and sleeves are very long. It is not slim fitting. I'm 5'6"" 135lbs, and small is very loose."
2.0,I really was excited to receive this item after all the great reviews. The dress I recieved was unlined and had a weird fit at the neckline. I tried to return but since it's a company in China I had to eat most of the cost.
2.0,Item not sized properly.  Cheap material and stitching showing.
2.0,Doesn't fit the and look the way it should... very small for the size I ordered but still a beautiful product
2.0,These earrings are very small. They remind me of barbie earrings. I do recommend the plastic hoops a little better. They look more for little girls
2.0,The space for the armpits are to big and show your bra. I had to pin them but was a real pain.
2.0,The Armadillo Dry Cooling Vest does not keep you cool. The only benefit I noticed was that my vest did not get sweat on it. The vest only provides a  barrier between your shirt and your vest. I sweated just as much wearing it. It looks a little bulky when you wear it and it is not very comfortable.
2.0,"This necklace will not hang right,keeps flipping over. I was so excited because it matches rings and earings I ordered.<br /><br />Items are not that easy to return because of lack of paperwork. I kept the necklace hoping to come up with breaking it apart and using a single rose.<br /><br />Not worth the price"
2.0,Update: had to return a week after receiving them lights will not turn off
2.0,"Not sure if I’m supposed to hand wash these, but after washing it in the machine, It got loose and I see threads coming out on the side of the mask. I’m a little disappointed because it was one of my favorites but I have to get rid of some. Really sad."
2.0,I returned this because the zipper didn't extend to the bottom of the robe.
2.0,This product was very cheaply made.  It is itchy.
2.0,Wore out and the band broke after a month.
2.0,Case is too thick - like hvg stopwatch strapped on your wrist.  But other big negative: have to push buttons 2 or 3 x to activate- my cheaper GShocks only requires once.  I use for work out rest timing and its very inconvenient to hv to push 2-3 x after each set.  Terrible for the $
2.0,Really had higher expectations on the warmth of product. Also more itchy than expected.
2.0,"Great fit, lightweight, looks great, but it doesn’t absorb water! Even after washing & drying several times it still doesn’t absorb water."
2.0,"Very ill-fitting, but with the return policy, it didn't hurt to try. The towso was cut very weird, not too flattering on my hourglass shape, which is surprising given the product image."
2.0,Bracelet is not a vibrant yellow but instead a very dull yellow not what I expected at all and I would not have purchased if I knew it was a soft dull yellow
2.0,It was nothing like the picture. The picture looks very detailed and the color stands out so much more. Not so with the actual charm
2.0,ordered a large and i think its a children's size
2.0,Looks nice but is kind of cheap. The clasp on mine broke on day one.
2.0,"They do tone down the glare from cars' headlights but the surroundings get darker, making it unsafe to drive with at night."
2.0,"It arrived damaged straps weren't sewn on securely they just came apart, one strap had no thread at all..i Will be returning"
2.0,No what’s I was expecting
2.0,"Gets the point of an interior across but small details like the dash not being curved like the real dash, there is a complete extra molded section between the overly large glovebox and instrument panel that looks like a place for a 2nd stereo, nor does it have any overhang for foot pedals, the steering wheel looks like it's for a mustang, the steering column, which doesn't resemble the thicker real column, has a random tab at the base with a random hole through it."
2.0,"After washing for a couple of times, the pajamas were two sizes down.  So, order two sizes up in order to wear it again.  Not recommended."
2.0,disintegrated after 2 weeks of wear.
2.0,"These seem like pleasant enough socks, but I received an XL pair (which is the only reason I selected them as I have large feet and need large socks) and they seem sized just like any one-size-for-all. Furthermore, there is nothing whatsoever on the sock or its retail packaging to suggest that they are of any size at all."
2.0,The size chart was inaccurate. The dress is cute.
2.0,Nice looking bathsuit. I'm disappointed at the quality of the bottom..after a single wear for less than 3 hours..it looks faded.. the fit was a little loose..I had to get it altered.
2.0,"It would be tons better, if there were side pockets in dress,, easy to do ?!?!?"
2.0,When I got mine they were faded and looked used
2.0,Band ripped and fell apart in just a month of wearing a couple times a week
2.0,Short top and padding sticks out at the top. Color is pretty and bottoms fit great.
2.0,sound is not so great and when talking on phone you can barely hear.  wish the cable was removable.  turning your head from left to right and they will fall off
2.0,"The pin part popped off the back so easily they started breaking. Beautiful concept , poorly crafted. But I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Cute shoes but the first day I wore them an eyelet came out and won't go back in. It honestly looks like two holes where made and the eyelet was still put it
2.0,"Pretty disappointed in how thin and tight this dress was. I ordered an extra large and this thing fits like a medium. The pattern is nothing at all like the picture, and the material is so thin that you'll need to wear a slip minimum underneath to keep from showing off all your goodies. I'm going through the return process right now, so hopefully I can get my money back. Can't believe I waited two weeks for this. :/"
2.0,Cute sandals but some of the parts of decor were either off or fell off when takjng it out of packaging  the cute out design seemed bigger than what it pictured on sale ad  they could have been a real nice sandal  but the quality of materials used and how it was put together just was bery poor  very disappointed
2.0,It had a weird shape to it and wasn’t appealing at all
2.0,It was ok looking but it was very uncomfortable around my neck.  It was annoying and had to take it off.
2.0,"Nice color, but Very thin and waaay tight"
2.0,"1. The rose is glued on, not sewed. If came off after one wash.<br />2. The shirt is see-through."
2.0,Very nice concept however the quality is not there.  The jump ring broke the first week. Would be best to solder the jump ring to prevent it from breaking.
2.0,Returned these as the fit was odd
2.0,to flimsy
2.0,"Disappointed and returned the item.  I read several reviews and decided to give it a try.  The dimensions and review are wrong about fitting a small laptop.  My dimensions did not even fit this bag.  I could lay it on top of the bag and it looked as if it would fit but trying to &#34;work it into the bag&#34; was a no go.  As mentioned, felt annoyed and disappointed to get the item after a late delivery and then it not work."
2.0,"This is a pretty dress but you can see through it, so you will need a slip."
2.0,Too small and does not fit as picture
2.0,These are not cotten. Not comfortable at all in rip very easily
2.0,"This was cheaply made. See through and unflattering, only buy if you’re super skinny"
2.0,"I ordered a 2xl.<br />The arms are puffy and spacious but the mid and lower part of the sweater fits more like a 1xl or even as tight as a large. Really tried to stretch the fabric, and to try and take it off was difficult.<br /> It’s not a win win on ranking the size chart."
2.0,"This may be durable, but the material is very rough and almost plasticy (rough sharp plastic not soft and bendy). I can't really speak to the durability yet as it hasn't been worn much but it does not feel comfortable."
2.0,Definitely a cute shirt just cut way too small
2.0,Very cute but one bracelet clasps arrived broken.
2.0,"I wore this necklace once and the color was changing through out the day that I had it on. It was cute when I first received it, but it just changed. I know that it was a cheap price and it wasn't real, but I wasn't expecting the color to fade so quickly."
2.0,Bought this base off reviews for my friend b'day night out but I'm so disappointed. It fits way too large. I usually wear XL but seems medium would fit me better. 😢
2.0,They did not last working outdoors in Minnesota.
2.0,"I purchased the Blue belt which I liked from the posted picture; however, when I received it, I realized the color is more Turquoise, which I do not really like."
2.0,"While this is very soft and very cute; the truth is the zipper broke within the first 6 times wearing it. Ordered for my daughter for Halloween pajamas, and the zipper broke off the track within the next month and a half. Upsetting."
2.0,They're only small enough to fit a child ear there were just too small
2.0,App version 1.2.1 crashes when trying to connect to the mask using iPhone with iOS 14. I was able to get it to work on Android. Hopefully the seller will update the iOS app soon.
2.0,It doesn’t start around your waist. It’s rolls up
2.0,"Pretty, but It broke three weeks ago"
2.0,Only wore twice and the material is already pilling.
2.0,the holes in the knees were soooo ripped . too ripped in fact . but the material of these are soft . also not as highwasted as you would expect
2.0,Handle with care cause it breaks easily.
2.0,"The overall look is fine, but size is somewhat small for a size 9 and are not comfortable at all."
2.0,"Two pairs fell apart within minutes of putting them on, very disappointed"
2.0,"To thin of a shirt, and I ordered a size bigger and it's still to small. The printed picture is very nice but that's about it."
2.0,"I bought the proper size per chart, Way too small."
2.0,"The ring has a cute design but that was where it stopped. The main stones are very cloudy and overall it is barely passable as costume jewelry, disappointing as the picture looked really different"
2.0,"Ok, but not as good as I had hoped - wore them skiing and my fingers were cold.  Wore them when the temp was at or near 30 degrees and my fingers were cold.  Would not recommend."
2.0,"Nice weight and seem generally well made, but the size of the two characters is so small that you need a magnifying glass to see any detail."
2.0,"Mask was very large even though I ordered a small. And even though the nose piece was upside down, the mask it self is solt and would be perfect for my 5 year old if she could wear it. Going to be returning it."
2.0,not great product to invest..it's nothing like shown..no flare nothing..disappointed..
2.0,"The quality of the fabric seems fine, and the fit is as expected. But the cut is not at all flattering. The skirt is so short that it doesn't cover the tops of your thighs, and in back it's so short it doesn't even cover your whole rear. It really looks stupid. Furthermore, the skirt starts so low that it actually highlights your belly instead of minimizing it. There are better suits."
2.0,"There are no pins in the band to attach to my watch. This is probably because of the opening on the side of the package. I don't think it is from the top of the package as that was resealed, but opened at one point nonetheless. The band itself looks like it could have been pretty cool for water and heavy activity. Oh well, I will try another brand. It just takes a little effort to get someone's business these days. This is definitely not the way to do it."
2.0,"When I requested this from Vine, I was super excited! At the $40.00 price point, I knew I wasn't exactly getting the best of the best, but it does look nice in the picture. The reality is different.<br /><br />First, the necklace is so darn small, I felt like I was choking. I couldn't put it on myself, due to how tight it was and also due to arthritis in my fingers. When my husband got it on me it was not comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The chain doesn't really look like the one pictured. To be honest, it looks super cheap. The stone itself is really, really pretty and that's the only good thing I have to say about this necklace.<br /><br />If I had a spare silver chain I would take the stone off this and hang it from that instead, but I don't. I think for this price, you could do just as well if not WAYYYY better at the Walmart jewelry counter."
2.0,the body of the dress was fine but the top is too big.
2.0,Beautiful but fragile. My daughter was devastated every time she lost and found one...then one finally broke. The clip is barely attached to the snowflake and broke off. Would be perfect for pierced ears but this just doesn't work.
2.0,The fabric is just too stretchy. The arms and legs stretch out..
2.0,too hard to get on and off neck w/ out destroying it
2.0,"Not pleased at all, they do not fit as the picture, the length is short. Planning on returning"
2.0,I love the colors in this sweater but it's see through and hangs funny. I don't think it flatters.
2.0,"I was excited when o received this dress. However, it fit larger than expected and was too long. After trying on I found a hole under the arm from the stitching was coming undone. The material is comfortable but it also is very thin in the sunlight. Not worth the price at all."
2.0,Ordered this product for my boyfriend who is a size 11 and shoes came as a 9. Definitely not true to size and would not be buying this again. It's cheap for a reason.
2.0,"Robe quality is fine for the price,  but the sizing is ridiculously small.  I wear between a large and an x- large.  Based on other reviews I ordered a 3xl praying it wouldn't swallow me.  It barely fits around me.  With the super short belt it is completely open from the waist down."
2.0,"Really wanted to like these shirts.  The quality of the shirt is fantastic, however you have to stretch the shirt to put it on and when you do, you break the stitching.  I wore this compression shirt 2 times and on both occasions, I heard the threading pop/break.  The shirt will eventually unravel.  Too bad ... the shirt quality is very nice but will eventually fall apart with the poor choice of threading on this shirt.  Going back to my other brand where the threading also stretches like the shirt.  Bummer.  Pricing is awesome.  :-("
2.0,The scarf was supposed to be grey but it is green. Either I was sent the wrong one or they have their colors way off.  Color does not match the description nor picture.
2.0,Very cheaply made and cheap material. Material frays very easily along seem and is itchy.
2.0,"The style of the product is good, but it is way too short. I'm 5'8&#34;, 146 lbs (pregnancy weight) and ordered a medium based on the size chart and the shirt just barely hits my hips when pulled down. The style is cute, but for a new mom that might have a little extra pudge around the middle or if you have a long torso, I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,Loose baggy crotch  area. I have to pull them up super high in order to not look weird
2.0,"So I love the way these glasses look,  but they got splashed while I was wearing them. I took out the cloth it came with and wiped them to dry them and it took all the reflective coating off the front. Very disappointed!"
2.0,Color is definitely different than pictured... Its darker not as vibrant in color... more of a reddish color :(
2.0,"I'm 5'6, 140lbs.<br />The wavy lines were not straight across like the sample picture which made my body look wonky and the different shoulder part was loose causing it sag. Now, I am a B cup so maybe if you have bigger breasts perhaps it will work out differently for you."
2.0,Not as supportive as other slippers.
2.0,A bit cheesy.
2.0,"Well printed, but is a super thin material and the sizing is far smaller than is claimed."
2.0,"I personally loved the meaning behind these bracelets, but unfortunately with time they turn either pink or green. So, I wouldn’t recommend it as much. But considering the price it was an okay product."
2.0,Dreadfully undersized!
2.0,This says 24 double sided cupcake wrappers in the dimensions pic but there are only sixteen.
2.0,"Beautiful design. Not meant for reading, the pitch of the lens is off. If you place directly over reading material the letters magnify only very little, if that, once it's raised,(roughly 1/4 to 1/2 inch) only two to three letters appear clear and the rest of the letters in the glass is distorted. Pin point usage with wasted area remaining. If you yard sale and collect jewelry, it may help detect main flaws or chips on small items if you can ignore the distortions, other then that, the pendent style is nice."
2.0,"Ok, the hat sort of looks like that, but it's the cheapest flimsiest material and the thing is child sized! And because of the flimsy fabric it doesn't hold its shape at all when you put it on--no puffiness.  And the small size makes it look more like a skullcap.  Waste of money."
2.0,I gave this a two because it is very eye appealing.  And I absolutely love how it looks.  But sadly there is no way its surgical steel because it infected my belly button extremely bad. So if you are allergic to certain metals do not buy this.  Because you will have a reaction to it.  But if youre not allergic to any types of metals then you should defiantly buy it.
2.0,Fit was well. I got a medium and am typically a size 6 in pants. The light pink is not actually as pictured- it’s a lilac/pale lavender color. Will be returning item.
2.0,Everything about the pants is great except the seams on the pair I bought my daughter pulled apart easily on one leg starating at the bottom. At first I thought it was something sharp had cut them.  She is very gentle on her clothing as we always either pass them to her niece or her clothes are donated to places that only accept gently worn items. Just a  QC<br />issue.
2.0,"Not like the picture. Material is see through and it is not stitched very well. Definitely would not purchase again. Would work well as a beach cover up. On another note, it arrived very fast an packaged well! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
2.0,"Feels like cheap jewelery, very light metal. Almost like costume jewelery. I guess for the price I got what I paid for."
2.0,Capris rather than leggings since they are not tight at the bottom part at the calf.
2.0,"After just a few months of use, my child came home from school with wet toes - the front tip of one boot was completely worn and had a hole in it. Did not expect that kind of damage for the level of use the boots get. Definitely would not recommend these."
2.0,"From the waist down, I love this dress. Lengthwise -I love this dress. Topwise - not so good...I'm 5ft tall and a 36D...there's no way that this dress could cover my top and even if it did, there would be no way to move in i without risking a nip slipt. Very flattering the rest of the way (got it for my honeymoon and husband loved it). Tried to wear a camisole under but it takes away the sexiness."
2.0,In the picture the hat looks like a formed hat. It actually has no shape to it.
2.0,weirdest fit. I have big boobs yet it was still too big but the bottoms were small
2.0,My daughter lived the fuzzy aspect but they were extremely short. Fit more like underwear and I bought them one size larger than she is.  Had to return them. Was very disappointed since she loved the look and feel of them.
2.0,"The whole set is very frumpy looking. The shorts are awkwardly wide and long. It’s comfy, but wasn’t for me. I decided to keep it for the top, but the first time I wore it I noticed a big hole in the side."
2.0,"I am in love with this dress. I ordered the xxl because of reviews, which turns out to be a little too big. Luckily it’s a true wrap dress and is an easy fix! I’ll be wearing this for my publishing debut and my graduation; so pleased.<br /><br />Edit: I bought another dress in a different color and they sent THE WRONG DRESS. So disappointed photo is of the second dress they sent me"
2.0,I did not get the bracelet as advertised very disappointed.
2.0,It's very cute but too small. And it takes a long time to receive.
2.0,It's a good wallet just kind of small.
2.0,Very hard to get on small wrists. My son actually got a bruise on his wrist from eating this band.
2.0,It's called a ratchet belt but it's not like any ratchet belts I have. Normal ratchet belts you do not have to mess with the buckle you just slide the belt into the buckle and it locks in.
2.0,The beads are quite big and it's too large for my wrist. Love the bead color. May try to take some beads out so it will fit.
2.0,"I was hopeful with a few of the other reviews that these might fit, but...nope. I am a solid size14, I usually wear 16 in pants because I want a very comfortable fit. The largest size available. They were coochie-cutters, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. It was a real let down; I was excited for the bright mustard color to help me stand out when I wore them."
2.0,"These shoes are very stiff and uncomfortable. Maybe as they are worn they will be better, but for now , ouch! They are really cute tho"
2.0,Barley covered my nip and had to send back
2.0,The seam of this dress ripped after wearing it for four hours. I had even ordered up a size because I wanted it looser and flowy. Very disappointed.
2.0,Thru are winners. The slippers are well worth the money.
2.0,Loose weave - not very soft or warm.  Try something else.
2.0,Didn't fit my head well.  It was a bit too long.
2.0,"Cheap material, way way way too small in the bust, I'm 5'9, 175, 36c size 12 us. This smooshed my breasts and way too tight across the ribs"
2.0,"I cannot tell you how this boot fits since the size 6 was so narrow even after unlacing the entire boot I could not get into it.  I have re-order a size 6 1/2 and hope this works.  Overall, the boot is gorgeous"
2.0,It's okay but is a lot cheaper looking in person than it does here.
2.0,"Although it seemed like a good buy, this isn't a cross body bag. The strap is not long enough. It would have been perfect if the strap was longer."
2.0,Loved this dress and was so excited to wear it. I washed it once by itself on the gentle cycle and the fabric ripped in an area that was not in a place I could fix it. So disappointed!
2.0,I really was in love with the dress but the material liked to cling and show off everything. I ended up returning it.
2.0,The XL should be labeled S.
2.0,"I am a personal trainer and I give these pants a 2/5. These shorts were very stretchy and the fabric was interesting. I would recommend wearing them possibly for a light workout. They do not seem like they have good wicking/air flow. so maybe not the best for an intense workout. The fabric might be acceptable for you but for me did not seem breathable. Yoga or mobility. I will say - they run big. They were huge actually and that is something to note. Order smaller if you want the right size.  They also coiled up around the tops of my legs and caused ridging, lots of looseness in the legs but tight in the top. These shorts do not have any retention and will ride up during your workout."
2.0,The price was great but these don't soak up sweat very good. I sweat a lot so I need a headband that soaks up sweat well.  These don't so much.  I have a couple older sweatbands I bought at Academy that do a much better job.  I will have to find those and buy them again.
2.0,Sent me 40DD that was labeled as a 44 DD im very upset by this and it was a very good deal.
2.0,I love the color and print of these shoes which makes it even worse because I can’t wear them. They are to narrow and a bit to small. I tried to wear them for a couple of weeks off and on hoping they would stretch but they don’t. One other thing is they are kind plastic so they don’t breath well at all which resulted in stinky feet!
2.0,Softness I liked
2.0,"I got this two piece bikini athletic swimsuit, and unfortunately it did not fit properly. I am 5'2"" and 115 pounds, so I ordered the XS size according to their size chart, but it was still much too tight. The material was okay."
2.0,Warma and fuzzy. Cute print. But way way too big. I usually wear an xs/s and these kept falling off me. It was awful. Had to give them away because they were just too large on my tiny frame. I'm 5'2&#34; and 90lbs.
2.0,These are cute as far as the color. As far as how they fit can you say CAMEL TOE?! They are very soft but I suggest sizing down. Another issue I have is the bottom of them are very loose and I have small ankles so it just looks awful. Like I said the color is cute but if you are getting these just know they are not supporting and to size down. Also they are mid rise I would say. I am 5'4.
2.0,This band fades quickly and looks old and dingy
2.0,My daughter loved these shoes but we noticed one shoe didn't light up upon arrival.
2.0,"More of a tank top with a nightshirt type feel<br />Doesn’t really fit like the picture suggests<br />Not structured at all<br />Still cute, but doesn’t fit like the picture"
2.0,These shorts look like they are high waisted in the picture above but
2.0,I wanted this shirt for hiking and sailing in a hot climate. I liked this one online because it looked more stylish than other brands but the fabric is scratchy and somewhat stiff. I returned it.
2.0,The outfit is short and I’m on 5’6. Material isn’t the best
2.0,These glasses look like they do in the photo but are honestly pretty horrible quality. You can’t even fold them back in properly because the parts that go behind your ear are so oddly stiff. I’m wearing them for Coachella but will probably never wear them again after that
2.0,The skirt is very short - which I expected from looking at the photo. It wears high waisted and fits well. What I disliked was that the top could not get past my shoulders at all. I would have been able to just accept I am a bigger girl but honestly this whole thing really is poorly crafted. Comparing it to skirts and tops I could buy like this in a store this was really poorly made. The zipper is works but it's a pain to pull up- I have to wear the skirt inside out so the zipper doesn't get caught while zipping then flip it right side out to wear it. The hems not only have a ton of extra thread hanging down but it's not reinforced at all. I can pull the seams apart with my hands if I wanted to. The material is also very thin and non-stretchy at all it kinda feels like wearing a tent. This is cheap but again comparing it to stuff you could buy at good will it's not really worth the price. I would recommend you spend a bit more to buy something that has better ratings.
2.0,"Product is not true to size I ordered a men's xl and it fit more like a youth large. Was not what I was expecting. Also the fabric is very thin for a ""hoodie""."
2.0,"not enough room in the toes, can't wear these boots..."
2.0,Cute but the gold only lasted a week
2.0,"I want this dress for a funeral, it was the size I wear but fit too small, so I had to go  to Boscov and buy one higher"
2.0,it broke within a week. it doesn’t leave any traces of green and the color never came off but it did break after about a week. it’s a beautiful ring but it’s very fragile.
2.0,These barely cover my feet and fall down to easily
2.0,"Although this is lovely, it broke the first time my daughter wore it. We were at dinner and the entire thing fell off her neck. Now I know the cost was cheap which meant the materials weren't going to be high quality, but one wearing? I was able to use pliers and hook the broken link but I don't think the links were meant to handle the weight of the necklace?"
2.0,I bought an XS and its too big. The pockets make the bottom half of the shirt look bulky. I love the colors but the style is just not flattering.
2.0,"It’s not as big as the picture shows. After washing, even getting smaller"
2.0,They keep coming off
2.0,Love the look of it and the concept behind it. Unfortunately the charm and chain tarnished with just 3 days of use. I took it off before bed or showering so it was just from minimal use :(.  So disappointed since it’s such a pretty necklace.
2.0,Chain is really small. If you are a tiny person this will work for you. But on me its a disappointment.
2.0,I'd go for a size larger than the chart indicates you need. Mine shrank up quite a bit on first washing.
2.0,"The image is identical to another dress I bought in a different color, so I expected the same quality. The material looks shiny, and the color is so much more red than the picture. The sleeves also fit more like 3/4 length than pictured. I’m sending it back."
2.0,"This shoe had factory paint(black) overspray on toe/heel;couldn't cover w/specially ordered blue polish.<br />Add't specialty polish was bought w/hopes to cover substandard finish. G'son WILL NOT wear shoe-other kids are mean. Shoe itself is okay. I'm embarrassed as neither two  professionally proposed repair attempts, not to mention cost of polish/cover-over kit/plus even more specialized polish, both of which came out of my pocket, never solved your inadequate finish! Do you have other colors that don't have issue? What can I do, and what are you willing to do to help both of us content? I would appreciate your every consideration. Thank you!"
2.0,"Long and comfortable.  The waist band is kinda thick, so it can add bulk. My biggest complaint is quality.  I wore them once and the entire top of my thigh area was pilled. Cant wear out with a cute top. They look worn out already."
2.0,Bracelet was too bulky
2.0,Color does not match picture and fit is weird
2.0,"I'm usually a large but I seen some of the reviews saying it came big so I ordered a small according to the size chart. It's still super big. For some it might not be a big deal. The quality isn't bad, a bit see through but since I'll be wearing it at the beach I don't mind. It's very stretchy material.  It's ok.<br />It doesn't hand right and it's cut extremely weird."
2.0,I am size 16  bought 2xx could not get pass the lower part of my legs also it is not wide legged waste of money and time giving it away.i have got no more time to waste
2.0,Torn after one month.
2.0,"I ordered a LARGE based on reviews because I wanted a looser fit. I received what appears to fit like a 2XL! I don't think the sizing is consistent on this blouse. I could get away with a SMALL or medium if the sizing is true. The fabric and sleeve makes it look like a uniform. I love the idea of collarless and contrast fabric design however. The cloth material is coarse and thick. Reviewer stat: 5'6&#34; tall, 34C bra size and wears 6/8 (mostly 6). Item returned."
2.0,I WENT TO PUNT CANA AND I SAW AN OLD MAN IN A WHEEL CHAIR SO I HELPED HIM TO HIS ROOM I HAVE A SENSATIVE NOSE AND I COULD SMELL A FOUL SMELL ....LATER ON I FOUND OUT IT WAS FROM THE WATCH DONT GET IT WET IT SMELLS LIKE DAY OLD SOCKS
2.0,Color not as expected. too big
2.0,"This dress was very pretty but it was massive on me. I got the smallest size, and the chest area was very baggy and the arm holes were huge. I would order a size down if possible."
2.0,"I purchased this dress about a month ago.  It is comfortable and has two pockets that I Like , however, after the first wash the fabric faded.  As a result, it was one time use only."
2.0,"I thought tote was beautiful, but only used a short time (few days) and snap broke. Tote on it's way back. Shame...I really like this tote."
2.0,It broke 6 weeks later ...Cheap.
2.0,These are a nice shoe but the colour is wrong. Really purple and not as shown in the picture
2.0,"Nice looking watch but band is too large and I'm 6'2  Not even close to normal size Then tried to remove two links with tool provided, and tool broke."
2.0,They fit but I don’t like them.
2.0,"23/Sep/19<br /><br />PROS<br />+ The fabric feels very nice, it's stretchy.<br /><br />CONS<br />- Fit is awfully big. It looks very awkward (Picture shown is small size, and my wife usually wears small sized clothing).<br /><br />I would say that this would be a great piece of clothing if the fit in the torso and waist was appropiate. The sleeves look cool and it's just a shame that the cut is that awkward...<br /><br />* I will update this review if something changes as I keep using the product.<br />* If you found this review helpful, please click below! This will help other users like you to make informed decisions before spending their money!"
2.0,"These came in broken,  one of the jewels had fallen off.  Other than that they look true to the picture."
2.0,The shirts seems are not held together well
2.0,"I was disappointed with these because in person they look and feel cheap. They're very light and when you wear them, you can hear the movement of the metal squeaking. It's not super loud but a little annoying. I was hoping to wear these for my wedding but the quality wasn't very good. I can see wearing these for a different occasion, just not my wedding day."
2.0,bought for work but did not help with sweat. i work in a very hot and humid environment and within an hour i was dripping sweat from this cap. if you are using for outdoor or low humidity environment would probably work better for you.
2.0,"The part of the earring that actually goes through the ear is squared, which means it sort of hurts throughout the day. I'm not sure it's not rounded, like other earrings.<br /><br />They're cute though!"
2.0,They broke after a week.
2.0,embroidery slightly cheap looking
2.0,"I was bummed about this purchase! The set was super cute in person, but the sizing was deceiving. The pants *might* have worked if it had an elastic waistline, but the zipper did no justice. I followed the size chart, and ordered a small accordingly. I am a size 4, 130 lbs., and 5'6"". If you're considering ordering, definitely order a size up and keep in mind that the bottoms are zip up and not elastic."
2.0,"These shoes ran very small in terms of the width. I do not know if it is the pair I got, as no one else seems to have had this problem. They are SO small, I cannot even get my foot INTO the shoe! They were very narrow, and when my right foot WAS able to fit in, they seemed a little short. I would be leary of purchasing this shoe!"
2.0,"I was disappointed.  It was advertised with paracord and non came with the package.  Also, some of the whistles DON'T work.  I am very disappointed."
2.0,The bag is very small and the fabric is very thin for a bag. I thought it would be a lot sturdier and bigger and the strap was too small to be worn as a crossbody bag. The material looks very different from the one in the picture of the product. I’m quite disappointed.
2.0,Does not look like real leather. I think this is on off shot of the Frye brand. Not worth the price.
2.0,"This product runs super large. The ""tie"" in the front is very long. It's a very awkward shirt. Glad it wasn't expensive.  Probably will never wear it."
2.0,"Edit: the baby blue with white diamond is all rayon and not cut correctly. Trying a second one but not holding my breath. I might need to order another color.<br /><br />Ok pros: nice fabric, washes well, stretchy, & great length. Not too hot, not too cold. Great for sleeping.<br /><br />Cons:. Measurements are just a tad on the small side. I'm 5'10"" and the tiny pockets on this were at my waist? Not a place I want my pockets at. So why waste the fabric making them. And they are shallow, So they tend to pop out of when you don't want them.<br /><br />Why two stars? I've bought for of these, wine, red striped, and black. All the of them in after several washes have bled on my sheets! Especially the red ones!! I've washed the red ones with Shout dye catcher sheets for 12 washes! And the sheets are just slightly less pink than the first load. The nightgown may be white but the time I'm done washing it. What a horrible dye seeing job! I would really like a couple of replacements for all off the time I've spent on this. Two stars because if they didn't have dye issues I'm an perfectly in love with the style and comfort of these!"
2.0,"I thought it was going o be more of a shoe ,less of a slipper."
2.0,The lace is floppy and curls up and it is overall just really big
2.0,"Cheap quality shirt, and smells horrible out of the package. Tried to wash and still stinks. Narrow shoulders but long tail."
2.0,I was walking my dog and by the time I got two houses down the socks were already sliding down under my feet.  Can't wear them.
2.0,I loved the look and feel of these leggings. I ordered my size based on the measurements. I couldn’t get them halfway up my thighs.
2.0,"The fit is fine, but the fabric rubs annoyingly. It's not smooth at all if thigh rub is a problem for you."
2.0,"They're heavy in the front. So can't wear for a long time.<br />To read while lying down, items can't be flat on your lap; they must be upright. I expected items could lay flat to read while lying down. Disappointed in this."
2.0,"This shirt wasn’t quite what I was expecting. I ordered the small and it fit alright, but it was thinner than I was expecting and honestly, just looked like old fashioned men’s pajamas. Definitely not something I’d want to be seen wearing!"
2.0,Chain is thin and the stone is small. And the ship time is long. I would not buy again
2.0,Great design but the sizing is terrible.  Barely fits my 8 year old who had a small head.  Would probably work best on a child aged 5-6.
2.0,"I followed the size guidelines and order a XL. WAY too small, zipper didn't even budge! Should have gone with my gut and tried the XXL right away. Color is also more red than I was expecting"
2.0,Wish they had some type of waist band to secure the slippery material from sliding when you walk.
2.0,The F-150 part fell of the key ring in under a month. Now i just have a key ring that cost me $10. Wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,"Really heavy. They look nice, great color and shine, but can only wear for a short time - disappointed, but not worth sending back"
2.0,I was expecting a sweatshirt.<br />It is more like a jersey type material.
2.0,"Snags and pilling within 3 hours of wearing it. It's soft and comfy but really terrible quality. This is also a t-shirt and not a bodysuit like their other products, I thought I could still use it but I doubt it'll hold up to one wash. Wouldn't recommend for anything other than a costume that you wear once."
2.0,No shire. Image is blurry
2.0,Very cute but pay attention to measurements. I did not & had to return them because the charms are much bigger than I like
2.0,I ordered gold that its what is says but it come silver n it looks cheap n feel cheap n there's not diamonds on it
2.0,It ok one Pearl is bad
2.0,I sent them back. They were not a tight enough compression.
2.0,Ok may review is based on my measurements of the pants both stretched and un-stretched. Western world standard for 3x and what I ordered.  Standard to fit 50-52 inch waist. These pants un-stretched waist 38 inches stretched 48  inches given this variation you need to order two sizes too large to get a chance at a proper fit.<br /><br />Unable to evaluate further give the amazing size difference.  Cannot recommend
2.0,Broke in the first week...:(
2.0,Looks like irregular pajamas purchased from a flea market!
2.0,"Gloves are OKAY but the tip part that allows you to use your electronics came off like a scratch off lottery ticket after one day of use.  If all you're doing is using electronics you might be alright, but just handling camera equipment for 8 hours was enough for the material to come right off the gloves."
2.0,The logo on the hat is smaller than expected and it did not come with the keychain.
2.0,"I loved the first pair that I purchased. Although they were a different color,?i expected these to be the same. Unfortunately the fit on this pair was totally different. They would not stay up and kept rolling down, cutting off the circulation in my leg and leaving an indentation. I am only 5’3” so there’s no reason for them not to cover my leg and to stay up. Hopefully, this was just a defective pair because the first pair was outstanding."
2.0,I ordered a bunch of earrings for my little nieces for Christmas; these were the only pair I received that were disappointing.  The gen stone looked dull and didn't match the quality depicted in the photo.
2.0,I like the design…in the photo. In reality it is cheap material and poorly made. It’s kind of like the waffle weave of a long John. And it’s thin. Thinking about returning it because it is made short and an XL is too snug. Sweaters should be roomy so I always order one size bigger. Black tops are hard to find for some reason and that is the only reason I hesitate returning it. I likely will. Not worth the expense. Grrr…
2.0,"ordered 34/36 belt size runs big, I am 34 and on last hole. . not worth returning"
2.0,"There were several loose threads when shirt arrived.  The zipper in the shirt is a woman's zipper, works from the other side than Men's clothing.  Might not be a big deal in Communist China but it is here."
2.0,I like this because of the blue on it and the N as it is my initial but it was very thin and small. After just a few weeks the clasp started popping open.
2.0,Not true to size. Fit kind of snug.
2.0,"I feel this is poorly designed. I have a pretty average body, I'm 5'1, about 135 pounds, B cup. The bottom fit fine (a little small but that was my own fault for not sizing up) however the top was strange and did not cover my nipples at all. I don't believe it was a matter of sizing- if I had larger or smaller breasts I still think the way it was cut would expose the nipples. My boyfriend attempted to squeeze the wire in the middle together, to bring the cups closer together but it didn't really help. I requested to return and the seller offered me a percentage off a future product rather than return this one due to high shipping costs. This was nice but I still was left with a useless bathing suit."
2.0,I really wanted the disc/charm.  The chain broke the first time I put it on.  I have other bracelets and necklaces that I can use.
2.0,Lead to believe these were for non-pierced ears.
2.0,It was damaged. The sweater fell apart because it was not sewed together
2.0,I ordered this briefcase for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  Only con is that the dye rubs off on his white coat throughout the day.  Need to figure out a fix for this!<br /><br />Update: Color transference continues to occur onto light colored clothing over 1 year after purchase and after attempting company's suggested fix of wiping it down with a rag to reduce transfer of oil and color.
2.0,"I returned this dress because it was just a little to short, & not as blousy as I expected it to be, I am normally a med, but I wanted the top to be blousy so I ordered a large."
2.0,Small and cheap looking.  Couldn't use it.
2.0,"This material is seriously like a mix between mesh basketball shorts and a table cloth. Just hideous! The fit and style was great, but the material - just no!"
2.0,It barely cleans silver after much effort and it was absolutely necessary to use silver polish to complete the job.
2.0,"Will be returning, fits like a trash bag."
2.0,Shirts fit large. If you wear a xlarge. Order a xsmall. Sleeve are at least twelve inches to long.
2.0,Material was okay but should have read the review for the sizing which would have saved me money and my time
2.0,Not what I expected  returning for refund
2.0,"I'm disappointed with this purchase. I wore it one time and then t broke on me. It is pretty, but I just wish it was made with better quality."
2.0,This is much smaller than it looks like in the picture. I have a normal size head but still had friends try it on. It's wearable but snug. I think the picture is very misleading.
2.0,Cute but an awkward length
2.0,The quality was good but way too small. Unfortunately we always wash items before they wear it and it didn't even fit.
2.0,"They do fit a little tight, but my disappointment was, I ordered white as in the picture, and These were dingy, dirty looking !!! Very dingy dirty looking !!!!! Would net order these again!!"
2.0,Got this for cosplay and it's essentially useless.<br />1. It's not nearly as shiny as the image and is far more if a mat finish when it's stretched.<br />2. It's got a really funky smell.<br />3. It took almost a month to arrive.<br />4. It's not a 4 way zipper! It a standard zipper that goes front to back!<br /><br />Not worth attempting to return and I will not be purchasing from them again.
2.0,"Sharp corners, be careful having it rub against cloths."
2.0,"Poor constructed, glue showing everywhere, I will have to do some work to it to make it wearable."
2.0,"Mostly fly's great indoors, Fun!<br /><br />My big dislikes :  Don't like that it has internal batt.  Cannot be flying while another batt. is charging.<br />  Also, good luck finding parts.  So far I have found a couple sites. But no parts for<br />  this model.  BLADE is a much better brand. Still buying parts for my much older<br />  collection of helis and quads."
2.0,I think the headlines says plenty. Stitching ripped out on hems on every pair.
2.0,To thin basically colored rubber-bands.
2.0,"I was so looking forward to this, but sorely disappointed after receiving a very PINK and poorly stitched cardigan instead of the grey that I ordered. The elbow patches are SO horribly stitched I can remove them with my bare hands (had I the time to time I would).  It's super unfortunate because the material is soft and it is comfortable. It wouldn't be so bad if I remotely liked pink. Alas, a waste of money in the end."
2.0,"Product is a cheap knock-off of an Aaron Judge jersey.  MLB.com notified me that their product was out of stock a few weeks after I placed my order, so I had no choice but to order this version from Overstuff in order to get it for Christmas.  It is thin material, not a true Jersey type, and at $59.99 it takes advantage of the fact that the real type of jersey material is no longer available for this season.  Hopefully my grandson won't realize the difference, but I would caution others not to by this version and pay this overpriced amount.  It's passable but not worth this price."
2.0,"Returning. No where did it say for Juniors, which made it too small. Package says it comes with halo, but it was missing."
2.0,"Came with 2 rips and a hole in the lining! Pretty pants, poor quality!"
2.0,"I found the material to be a little rough, polyester. Good idea but the design is not great. Ordered 2 and do not use. Switched to colored and patterned N95's."
2.0,Somewhat disappointed. THIS IS NOT A SPORT BRA. No support at all. Good for lounging around.
2.0,Looks great but the form and size gives me a headache even wearing it just a short time. Hard to say it's a good investment when it can't be worn for any length of time<br /> It's really a shame. Nice looking.
2.0,Didn't notice a difference..
2.0,"I was frankly disappointed in this ring.  The stone has no amethyst color at all;  the color is more of a solid  garnet red with no striations showing at all. I realize it's not fine jewelry, but I did expect it to at least resemble the photo."
2.0,Too small child size it fit my 11 year old granddaughter.
2.0,"Very small, wore them once ripped down the outside seam of the leg after 1 wash."
2.0,These are horrible things that leave marks and are so thin they are not worth the trouble
2.0,Nice otherwise
2.0,"It's not what's advertised. It looks like a sweater type in the pictures. In actuality, it's a cotton material. Still pretty, and my daughter still liked it."
2.0,Don't work very well
2.0,Item arrived without the ribbon used to draw it together. Will need to return or swap with a replacement.
2.0,Love the look but it's way to small. Even my kids won't wear it.
2.0,Cute spring/summer top but the seams tore the first time I wore it :( the shirt was very loose so there was no reason it should have torn other than being poorly made. I was so excited about this shirt cause it's beautiful but I can't wear it again.... very disappointed
2.0,looked cheap and very narrow
2.0,Wanted to love it but simply trying it on ripped a hole in the sleeve. White material is also very thin. Disappointed. Wish the quality was better bcuz it’s very cute and trendy.
2.0,These are ok but look nothing like the pictures.
2.0,One of the earrings was completely black and no amount of buffing would clean it. There were three pairs total so hopefully the untarnished ones that are left will last longer than a day.
2.0,"Gave to my cousin the largest size fits someone whos about 180lbs, definitely not me lol Was really cute though a little stiff."
2.0,Slips off the knees easily
2.0,This purse is thin and cheaply made. I gave it to my granddaughter.
2.0,"While nice, didn't love it and returned the item. It ran larger than I was expecting."
2.0,"These shoes were purchased for my son's indoor shoes at school. Although we have had them for six months, with summer break in there,  he only wore them for a short time. The sole of the shoe came off and they are no longer usable. disappointing quality. For the price, they should last longer."
2.0,"Smaller than expected. It is also closed off at the bottom. It looks like it's fron the dollar store, not worth the money imo."
2.0,Honestly for the price these are total junk. I think they’re plastic- like even the “metal” part. They look and feel like those little toys you get out of a quarter dispenser for kids.
2.0,Quality is not what I expected it to be. Was missing a small stone when it arrived.
2.0,My daughter wears a size 3.5 currently so I ordered a size 4 so she'd have room to grow over the summer. We got them in hand and the fit was weird. Her heel hung off the back of the shoe and there was a whole bunch of room at the front. We started a return and got our money back to purchase her new shoes.
2.0,I wanted this to work so bad.  They are a little large and need to be pulled up more than I would like.  These are going back.
2.0,"Cute necklace but super, super cheap looking. It’s a cheap looking gold. My family hates it. I like the length. Don’t waste your money"
2.0,Supposed to Be an oversized jacket like pictured. Instead was normal TTS jacket with an added cloth hood. Also had a horrid smell.
2.0,Its a cute shirt but it fits weird around the shoulders.
2.0,The color blue is beautiful and the sweater fits well. I did not like that the hem rolls up when you wear it. For that reason I dislike the sweater.
2.0,"The jacket was not as thick as expected since it uses the word thicken in discription and not for being a parka. Also, after drawing the drawstring tighter in back what are you to do with the access, it looks like you have a tail, If you cut it to tie it the strings will fray. What a dumb idea."
2.0,"I purchased one before and loved it, looked and felt like leather, this one looks and feels like plastic, like the leather belts made with ground leather rests that are glued out of leather ground material."
2.0,"Lenses are a bit hazy, frame is flimsy, not the best pair, but it is sufficient for an emergency pair to leave in the glove box."
2.0,IDK why I bought this thing.
2.0,Loved the image but the fabric is too slippery for my mouse...would not recommend
2.0,Bottom fits great but top not so much
2.0,It's doesn't soak sweat well and it has a chemical smell to it ! It was a waste of $10 for me ... expect it looks nice 😄
2.0,"I thought I hit the jackpot with this set of 12 black beanies. I could give them to family members and a few friends and still have extras. Everybody loves a good beanie in the wintertime! Upon trying on a beanie though, I learned that they are not well made. The hats don't stay put as they should. I put mine on and five minutes later it had zoomed up my head to perch crazily on top of my head like a dunce cap. The fabric doesn't have enough structure to cling where it should. They look nice in general, but are not very functional."
2.0,This is by no means a push up top. It was also extremely small. I sent it back. Didn't like it at all!
2.0,"Really weird fabric felt slippery, almost slimy. I could have tolerated that, but not the fact that the fabric was so sheer you could see not only the color, but the texture of my undergarments beneath it."
2.0,"These are cute shoes, but not at all water resistant, and no arch support at all. frankly I""m disappointed. I purchased them to hike in and they just are not great for that"
2.0,"Returning this sweater!<br />The fit was on the small side, I got an xl, and it fit like a large.<br />But the reason I’m returning it, is because it’s super itchy. Not soft at all. Kinda like wool-ish material. Not low quality, just not a comfortable material"
2.0,Not even a little see-through.
2.0,"This item is not PINK, more like a light peach. Quality is fine (with the exception of a gash on the material by the right seam), just doesn't match my shoes!"
2.0,Very flimsy broke off already I hadn't had it even two weeks
2.0,They are way to big and heavy for my 18month old I would not recommend for a child younger than 10 years old. Firat night she wore them the back of one fell off. Not very impressed
2.0,"If you are a US size 4, this is way too big."
2.0,I will only wear this around the house not in public...
2.0,I need a medium!!!
2.0,"I appreciate the shape of the bathing suit. I am five feet, 135 lbs and it fits well. But I was shocked when the swimsuit arrived because I didn't recall ordering a hot pink bathing suit. To my surprise, I actually ordered &quot;X-Rose Red&quot; which in the photo looks like a magenta or maroon pink. That was NOT the color I received. Too, the material of the bathing suit is *really* thin. Underneath the top &quot;flare&quot; of the bathing suit, you can see my nipples and as far as I know, when in the water, it may expose the bottom half of me as well. Overall, unhappy and unsatisfied. Especially because I ordered this and it arrived on time for my international trip but now I don't have time to return and re-order a different color or bathing suit."
2.0,The pants for my daughter fit well. The shirt on the other hand fit 2 sizes smaller.
2.0,The can seemed nearly empty. Was not enough paint to cover my steering wheel. The product that did come out covered fairly well but the spray did not atomize well (spattered spray pattern).
2.0,In the picture it looks more like it is black stripes but in person it is definatly blue. You have to have a long torso and a small chest to wear this well. I would love to return but when you order straight from china they tell you that the only way they will return is if you pay for the shipping. Not worth while.
2.0,cannot fit anything into them. Fits more like a 7/8&#34; than a 1&#34; and there's no room to loop anything through them for the adjustment portion of these.
2.0,"The description says pocket and there isn't one. Also the cording for around the neck is a very cheap (skinny) leather-like cording that will immediately gouge into your neck.<br />I can say, the faux fur was extremely soft, that's why it's not getting a one star. But buyer beware, NO POCKET!! The description is misleading."
2.0,"It's actually weird that I'm asked to review an item that I requested to return because it fits awkwardly and the material is cheap. I have several of this style of cardigan,  wouldn't recommend this brand...at all. Additionally when I requested a refund the seller tried to negotiate a percentage of a refund...I essentially ignored it,  I figured if they were that hard up I'd keep it and just not ever purchase from this brand/seller again..."
2.0,"The clasp on the 24 inch just can't be made to work. The 18 inch is not 18 in, I don't think. It was too small for me. I'll give it to my grand daughter"
2.0,"The belt itself is cute. It came packaged well and on time. But, the hooks in the front do not match up properly so it can just pop off at anytime. Which lets just say is very embarrassing when your in front of people working and your belt just pops right off for no reason. Wish it could of worked out."
2.0,"Cute package but the ne llave is literally so tiny you can’t see it on. Smaller than a quarter, about the same size as my nail."
2.0,"I had purchased this to be a little modest at the beach and it definitely was NOT that! Read the reviews and trust them. This is not fully lined in the back, so you could completely see my butt. Also this ran a little small for me. I wear a size ten and purchased a size ten and it did not fit at all. If you do decide to buy, definitely purchase a size twelve. I am 5'3 and about 135 lbs and everything hung out. I was really disappointed and will not purchase Cocoship again. I only gave this a rating of two because it shipped super fast and it was really easy to return. Definitely buyer beware!"
2.0,Not nearly as nice as actual Garmin replacement bands. I'd suggest paying the extra money and getting a Garmin band. I will say though that I had zero problems with the seller.
2.0,"Twice I have ordered this shirt in a LARGE and Twice I have been sent an XTRALARGE.  Fix your system.  I like the high neck on the shirt, but if it's too big, I can't wear it!"
2.0,They are cute but they all are the same size so wearing them as shown in the picture is impossible.
2.0,"And it's not stretchy at all, so a bit uncomfortable"
2.0,The product depicts the shirt to fit long... when I ordered the product I got a size bigger just in case it fit too tight. Well it didn’t fit tight it just fit like a crop top
2.0,Pants are cute but sizing definitely runs small. I am always a medium and these were about 2 sizes too small for me
2.0,"Size is way off.  We purchased a 2XL and it fits more like a Med/Large.  Nice material, lightweight. Too bad it didn't fit"
2.0,"I read the reviews before ordering, most said true to size.  Just a heads up this is not so. The product runs at best a size smaller. Buyers be ware. The material is nice and I love the print that is in it, just wish it where the correct size."
2.0,Two stars only because the pants are always going down down down.  Ending up looking like I am trying to wear pants at half mast and that is not my intention.  Not that they are to large. Just slid down uncomfortably even if  tied snug.
2.0,Smaller than usual leotard sizes and shrunk to tiny size after one wash
2.0,The item fits perfectly in terms of sizing but the color is not what I expected.<br />The picture the white is much lighter<br />And when I received it was a grey color it makes the shaket look dingy
2.0,"I like the way they fit, But the material was very thin and the color wasn’t bright like it shows. I definitely would not buy again."
2.0,"I had expectations for this dress, however it really disappointed me. The seam on one side was off and fit was tight. It looked great on the model in the picture but the fabric and fit were not what I expected."
2.0,There were spots on the jacket. It is a beautiful jacket though.
2.0,The fabric was heavy with  a prominent twill  texture.  Green color darker than photo. Returned.
2.0,"Cool idea, but very narrow. If you have a large or average sized head, these will look weird on you."
2.0,"Great view outside, really blurry in the water"
2.0,"Bought this in black and white and those colors are great: lightweight, slim fitting, flattering, can be dressed up or worn casually. It’s long enough to be tucked and the ribbing doesn’t pull. Then bought in the pink and it’s a completely different material and a different fit. It’s shorter, thicker and the ribbing is wider. Doesn’t lay nicely. Just not the same shirt. Kept white and black, returned pink."
2.0,"The tights themselves are ok quality, but the sizing was off. I measured my legs carefully, and due to athletic thighs, had to order a size up.  I shouldn't have -- these now offer very little if any compression in comparison to my regular tights.  Additionally, if you're trying to wear these with skirts / dresses above the knee, the seaming around the top will likely show.  I wore them to work one time and spent all day trying to pull my dress down to cover the tops of the stockings, and it was far from immodest in length.  If you're wearing a dress at or below the knee, they will probably work."
2.0,I really liked this ring...until it tore and broke 3 months after I bought it. I never did anything to it - I even removed it when I showered. I just looked down at it today and noticed it wasn’t torn almost completely in half. :(
2.0,"This was a nice product but it is not durable or sturdy, one side of the clip broke today and the second side is way out of whack<br /><br />There customer service is definitely fantastic and reach out if you have any issues, they are honest folks"
2.0,Sent the wrong color.  The nursing pictured is a bright fushia pink/purple.  Disappointed<br />Fit well.  But not as advertised
2.0,"Koi has always been one of my favorite brands and I have never had an issue in the past with how they fit. But this time, I do not like the fit. it's a bit too wide and too short. if I raise my arms up, my stomach shows and since its wider than normal, it makes me look fat. I would have returned them if I didn't have to have them for work. but I was in urgent need for them."
2.0,Just want to add that you dont use pliers to put on earrings. And if you do and hurt yourself in the process....dont blame the product. Thats your own fault.
2.0,My daughter just received it and it started to completely pill up before the end of the first day!
2.0,There were as described but the frame is extremely filmy and broke after a few wears.
2.0,These earrings are just as cute as the picture but heed the base metal detail.  These can't be worn by my daughter as there is no hypo- allergenic plating to keep them from irritating her ears and parts of the hooks are corroded and black.  I plan to buy gold plated earring hooks to replace the original base metal ones so my daughter can wear them.  They also took the full 3 weeks to arrive as they were shipped from China.
2.0,There are a lot of more interesting baseball sock available. Graphics too fuzzy.
2.0,"This hat is well made, nice fabric. But, is much bigger than I expected."
2.0,Too short and small.
2.0,Not great quality either.
2.0,The fabric quickly had fur balls appear and it would hold tight on my wrist allowing my watch to be face down all the time.  The quality just isn't in these bands and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  The cost of a smart watch is to high to use inferior bands.
2.0,Really cool shoe and the lights are awesome but they don’t last. After about a week the button to control the lights fell off walking so we can no longer turn them off.
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these dresses that were the VIISHOW brand and another one that was EttelLut. The two that were VIISHOW fit great in the bust, waist, and hips. I normally wear a size 16 and ordered an XL. Both brands were soft. The VIISHOW ones had really tight sleeves though and the sleeves came about 3 inches past my fingertips. The sleeves were tighter at the elbows than they were anywhere else. The hemline is not a straight hemline. It was up and down and kind of looked weird.  I returned both of these dresses and kept the other brand."
2.0,Well made. More like a change purse than a real sized purse
2.0,"I had my set of glasses for over 2 years with the original lenses and it took along time to the lenses to get scratches of daily use and abuse. After ordering these new set of lenses, they got scratches within 1 month!!! I wonder if these are replicas.  I'm just going back to my military PX and buy a full set, which come with gray, amber and clear lenses...it will be cheaper in the long run than buying these low-quality replacement lenses."
2.0,You can see everything under it
2.0,"The suit looks like the picture, but it is rather heavy with all the fabric to actually where on the beach. I wore it once and probably will not wear again."
2.0,I got some shorts from this brand not long ago. I was impressed with their thickness/squat-proof-ness for the price so I thought I’d like the pants too.  While the fit and comfort are comparable these (in Navy) do not pass the squat test. They’d be ok as loungewear or for home use.
2.0,"top big, bottom small,  no I don't have a big butt<br /><br />However, I will give Naggoo 4 stars for there customer service!"
2.0,This is thin Tee shirt material.
2.0,"Cuts skin, sharp edges"
2.0,"These just made me so sad. They looked like they could have been different and unique, but they were clunky and poorly dyed. They sat off the ear way too much. Definitely not as pictured and I did return them."
2.0,"The arm strap and the strip across the top aren't connected to the body. And, there's no elastic along the top of the body fabric, so it just hangs loose. The color's nice, though."
2.0,Just received this it took awhile to get here but I expected that.  It was really nice but very very thin. When u hold it up u can literally see through it.  Not really gonna block much out but it did look nice
2.0,"I really liked these earrings and was bummed when I lost one. Using the “reorder” option on Amazon seemed a great idea. The earrings were delivered a day late, but that wasn’t too upsetting. However, the earring on the left was my original. I used “Order again” and the earring on the right is what I got. I am not a happy customer. Let’s see how long it takes to straighten this out!"
2.0,"IT'S JUST O.K., TOP IS O.K. BUT BOTTOMS NOT WORTH IT."
2.0,"The necklace is fabric, and it separated from the clasp after wearing only a few times.  I sent it back.  I must say that Amazon was very good about accepting the return."
2.0,One time use don't get wet turns the next day
2.0,Horrible fit and the pockets makes your hips look huge.
2.0,I wear a 14 and xl was tight on me not flowy /baggy looking like pic
2.0,Fabric felt a bit on the cheap side.  Not as nice as I was hoping.  I eventually went with a different product
2.0,Super cute! However one of the suspender clasp was broken after only a couple of hours wearing them. :( And I'm not sure if they can be fixed.
2.0,Bag isn't terrible but don't be fooled in thinking it includes the charger cable or power supply because it doesnt.
2.0,The 1st pair the thumb in one side was smaller than the other so I ordered the next pair up and this are too big for my 11 year old.
2.0,Smaller than expected and almost completely see through. Returning give minutes after receiving.
2.0,Zipper broke when trying on. Wasn’t able to use for Halloween! Total bummer.
2.0,It was thinner than expected and a lot smaller in size.
2.0,"I am disappointed that this product took more than 90 days to arrive and in the size. I ordered XXL, the vest fits more like a tight large. The quality though seem to be very good, seams are stitched well and materials seem to be great, I just cant wear it."
2.0,It was smaller then I thought so I returned the item
2.0,This dress is cut very strangely and is not flattering. I was hoping it would look nicer. The material was kinda strange and did not feel very comfortable. It's a good price but it was just not my cup of tea. Sending mine back. Hope it works nice for someone else.
2.0,Okay so I'm a bit plus sized. I got XL. And it hugs me. If you have big boobs.. nope. I have a D cup. Smooshed. XL would be a regular medium.
2.0,"If you wear a size 12, then you should get the next size bigger because this version makes your feet uncomfortable."
2.0,Way too big. Wide in my foot
2.0,Was short but material was not very durable !
2.0,Like other reviewers flimsy. Fulfills a look but not regular wear and the zipper is on the wrong side…
2.0,I opened it and the package was broken upon arrivle I opened it and it was broken very disappointes
2.0,I am tired of not knowing where the clothes are coming from usually overs seas. Label I have never heard of and material cheap and most of the time the sizing is wrong.
2.0,Horrible material. like shiny cheep looking
2.0,I'm a chesty but small sized otherwise girl and I found this to be frumpy.
2.0,This is a very unique ear cuff BUT beware as the item is much smaller than pictured even with the dimensions given you still won't be able to figure out how it will look on YOUR ear until you receive it.
2.0,This shirt....love the style and the colors but where the knit parts meets the solid color the stitching was all messed up.  Tightly sewn on one side to create the flow of the shirt but the other side had none...looked bad but I kept it to wear around the house and garden as it wasn't worth the hassle to return.
2.0,This bag fell apart really fast.
2.0,Liked the color hated how cheap they are made . Disappointed
2.0,very cheap material. all ended up falling apart after a few wears
2.0,"I really wanted to like these sandles. Because they look incredible. However are just not comfortable to wear. It's not about the size. I got exchange without hassles. The problem is probably the design. The bumps and ridges that are meant to contour the soles are oddly located. It could be just me. But they are just not able to fit everyone's feet. I had blisters under both of my feet after a couple of hours of walking in the mall. And the fabric of the strap is somewhat rough. No chafing but annoying. Lastly they don't have much cusion. My feet got super sore after wearing them. To be fair, I wear comfortable sneakers to work almost everyday. Guess I'm just not used to wear other types of footwear without good support and cushioning. So buys just keep that in mind. Have I metioned they look super cool? 2 stars for the style."
2.0,Thin and flimsy!
2.0,Fabric was very strange  very stretchy. I wear a 14 and ordered an xl.  It was way too small. Especially the sleeves.
2.0,not real confrortable
2.0,They ripped my pants from wearing them
2.0,"Very cute shirt but falls apart quickly, disapointed."
2.0,Super cute globe...love the pendant but the chain has NO clasp. Cannot wear it.
2.0,"These sleep caps were just dropped off 10/19, I immediately opened the box to reveal 4 nice looking caps at first glance.<br /><br />2 pc were 100% polyester,  thin, perhaps durable & comfortable but I have to wash them first.<br /><br />2 pc were possibly poly blend with satin lining. The Burgundy cap was fine but the Gray cab was not sewn properly. see pictures with missed stitches. Very disappointed with this product."
2.0,"I have now had 2 sets of these lenses. Both times, the lenses fit as advertised but only last for about one year (under normal wear). The tinting on the lenses starts rubbing off after one year. I'm at the point now where I'm thinking of trying another company, rather than purchasing another."
2.0,"Sized way smaller than expected. Fabric was way cheaper than expected, returned."
2.0,Pretty but short and the size is smaller than what is written. I am 5'4 and this dress comes to my calfs. Disappointed
2.0,The ties in the front kind of droop
2.0,Needed to return it
2.0,The picture is better than the product
2.0,The fit is good but they had a hole in them the first time I put them on.
2.0,"The picture shows a relaxed fit t-shirt with a vibrant print, but that's NOT what I received.  The shirt is stretchy almost like swimsuit material.  It fits wide through the neck and shoulders while squeezing tightly at the waist and hip. The colors are beautiful, but the weird fit just ruins the shirt.<br />Unfortunately, this is going back."
2.0,"I should have sent them back.  My daughter and I wear the same size.  She has very average width feet and her toes are average length.  The strap closest to the toes fits past the little toe on both of our feet.  I cant imagine it fitting right on any foot.  Her little toe always sticks out under the strap and she has just been a good sport about wearing them, but I wouldn't recommend them if you can't try them on.  They would have been cute otherwise, but I would never wear them like that."
2.0,"I bought an X-Small, and the tag says XS, but they're at least Mediums. They're also baggy in all the wrong places, so if you wear compression tops, you're going to have a huge mess of cloth that gets baggy right at the waistline. The outer fabric looks and feels like the same fabric I've seen in cheap pillowcases.<br /><br />I'd probably give them a 3/5 if the sizes were correct, but they're lucky to get a 2/5 from me as they are now."
2.0,Not what I expected. Felt like description wasn't accurate
2.0,"These pajamas are comfortable. But the pair I received did not have pants pockets, as depicted in the product overview."
2.0,"Really cute belt, but functionally useless. I ordered this belt to pair with a black dress I was wearing to a wedding, as white belts were non existent in the stores in my town. I ordered Prime and got it the day before the wedding. When I tried it on I realized that the two metal pieces would not clasp together, making the belt completely useless because it wouldn’t stay on.  As a last resort since I had no time to order and receive a new one, I hot glued the 2 pieces together and had to step into the belt to put it on. Again, it’s a super cute belt and was a great price, but I wish that it would have been tested before it left the warehouse. Also, it strangely came to me bound with someone’s blue hair tie that had a cat charm on it."
2.0,"I did not like. I did not like the pink color, it is very different from the photo. The picture shows a very comfortable blouse. But I would not really recommend it for people over 70kg. It fits the waist and the blouse is uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"Shoulder straps stiff uncomfortable fabric. Bra cups fit, except the band is too tight. Although I ordered one size up from xl to 2xl."
2.0,"necklace came broken.  Where the larger pieces are dangling off, that chain was not connected to the rest of the necklace- had to buy repair tool and small rings to attach to necklace. Don't waste your money- can find better quality  elsewhere"
2.0,"Would not buy again, size isn't right, or elastic out of package is bad."
2.0,Had a very cheap look to it. I gave it away
2.0,"I ordered another pair like these from a different supplier off amazon and they were perfect. I wanted another pair but the price went up so I decided to give these a try, why not, after all you can return them. These are much larger compared to the Ray Bans they look like. I ended up returning them and just spending the extra money to get them from the supplier I purchased from before."
2.0,"It worked great at first.<br />Outside is solid and can withstand drops and impacts.<br />Unfortunately the manufacturers skimped on the inside accordion style card holder.<br />This is flimsy plastic that cracks and breaks after about 6 months of use.<br />Once this falls apart, cards get stuck in the seem and the wallet won't close."
2.0,It did not match the picture!!! Totally flat dress!!
2.0,"Orange is not like in the picture, it's like a horrible version a neon orange. Top fits ok but the bottoms is too large"
2.0,Arrived cracked down the middle which is a bummer
2.0,"I normally wear a L tshirt or XL for an oversized one... I ordered an XXL - and it fits me like a M - super snug. Not sure if it is the ""chinese sizing"" or this one was mislabeled..."
2.0,"Material Very Very THIN, arms small, sending this one back not considering reordering this one."
2.0,The chain looked great when it was new. After 5-6 wears the platinum finish began to peel off. Do not recommend it unless it's for couple of uses.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. I am typically a medium top and large bottom, so I bought a medium dress. It was too big and didn’t cinch at the waist as much as I’d like. I returned and bought a small. I felt it was still too big and didn’t cinch at the waist.  I tried it with a bra and it looked better as it tightened the waist a bit, but the bra straps were very visible. Didn’t look good with or without a bra. Probably could have sized down one more, as it is very stretchy and roomy. Will be returning."
2.0,"I wasn't at all happy with this product.  It was way too small, took over a month to arrive and seems poorly made. I have no idea how to return it since the return address is in Chinese characters.  I'll be donating it to charity. I won't buy from this seller again."
2.0,very small in the calf area.
2.0,"Cute, but very poorly made. Expected better quality given the price. Don't expect to get more than one or two short wears out of it. The skirt was ripping off of the dress after wearing it for an hour for a parade where all she did was walk, it was almost completely ripped off by the end of trick or treating."
2.0,"I would love these shoulder pads--BUT THEY ARE TOO WIDE FOR MY SHOULDERS.  My shoulders are simply not wide enough for them.  They show at the neck edge of almost everything but turtlenecks. I've actually cut them back, which involves moving the velcro and is ""a pain in the neck,"" so to speak!  I wish this company would make some truly petite should pads...maybe an inch narrower.  That might not leave enough inches to ""slope"" the pads toward the outer edge...but for sloping shoulders (alas, mine are), that would not be a problem."
2.0,"It’s a nice bracelet, but it says I ❤️ my Soldier. Marines aren’t Soldiers and I haven’t even had this for two months and one of the charms already fell off. Unfortunately, it’s already past the return date."
2.0,"I use these to ride my motorcycle and mountain bike.  They brake at the hinges after a while.  I was using them because they were cheap, but I don't anymore for safety sake.  I am afraid they will just brake and then i will explode."
2.0,"Adorable shirt, wish I took the other reviews more seriously. I only went up 1 size XL... it's a tight fit so I only wear on my skinny days lol it's basically see through as well. 5'2&#34; 36DD and the XL is tight tight!"
2.0,Was hoping it would be longer.
2.0,"The name &#34;LOLA&#34; rubbed off, it now says &#34;LA&#34;."
2.0,It ripped after a month. useless
2.0,"I love the design of the shirt, I think you need to order a size larger than you wear. I buy a lot of these type of shirts from Amazon so far all have fit perfectly except this one is tight, that’s why I suggest you get it a size bigger. But the color and pattern and style are nice. I will only be wearing this one at home though."
2.0,"This cap is not the same quality you would expect for the price of the item. Cheaply made, smaller and lighter, unlike other ball caps you can buy from retailers like Lids or Fanatics. Liked the logo but returned."
2.0,buttons like a girls shirt
2.0,I wish the drawstring would sinch more. A tighter fit would be better.
2.0,Like the pattern and the material it's made out of but it is awkwardly short and the sides flare out wierd
2.0,"The pattern and fabric are great.  They contour to the nose and the fit is comfortable.  With the clear plastic, the moisture builds up. It gets foggy and the plastic is uncomfortable with all the moisture. I can't wear them for very long because it sticks to my lips."
2.0,"This product is not as described. The lanyard is definitely not leather, nor is the ID holder. I wanted what was pictured in the photograph (because I had that one before and LOVED it), but the ID badge I received is definitely not the one in the picture. Unfortunately, this item can not be returned either. :("
2.0,Bought this to ease neuropathy pain for family member.  The seams are rough and hit right at the most tender spot. Otherwise the quality was acceptable.
2.0,Doesn’t look as nice when recieved I returned it. It felt like is was too tight around the neck area
2.0,Don't buy this.  This isn't cotton.  The material is super cheap and basically see though.  Smells bad also.  Almost like a chemical.
2.0,"It’s 100% polyester. Not cotton fleece. So it’s cheap, very thin, and itchy."
2.0,"I received it today but when I opened it for box, I found out it was scratched"
2.0,The body of this shirt is more of a skin-tight version.
2.0,Returned as it was too small for the items I carry.
2.0,"I loved the top from the waist up, but the bottom looks cheap and it hung weird due to the hi-low cut. I have a large bust [36DDD] and it was very cute in that area without showing too much, but I couldn't get past the way it hung. Sort of looked like a maternity dress. Returned."
2.0,Cute design but really thin and the outer layer felt like a trash bag. Returned it and got something heavier and more durable.
2.0,"The idea is cute, but for anyone with large boobs, there is no support and i felt like i was spilling out"
2.0,Item looked to be metallic but is a painted cheap plastic.  Item is way over priced for what it is.
2.0,"They fit okay at first, but the quality is very poor.  Now, after 10 wearings or so, the elastic has failed, so what were trunks become sagging boxers. The design has no fly, which poses problems for relieving oneself cleanly.  It amazes me that so much work is put into the sewing, but the materials are really bad, especially the elastic.  I guess the materials are where to cheapen everything.  These are somewhat small on fit, maybe more savings by cheapening"
2.0,"I love the material, but the pockets make the middle of the dress SOOOO BULKY!! looks like you have hips for days, not a good look !  Think I'm going to have to have it altered, and pockets eliminated to wear it.....doesn't look good on right now"
2.0,"I had to return this because the chest was waaay too low for me. If you like showing off your girls,  then totally go for it!"
2.0,Super thin I got it and just returned it bc it’s so thin not worth it I ended up buying 120 piece set of nice sturdy ones for$ 9.50 And ordered another themed one a cross and it’s heavy sturdy
2.0,"The shirt itself is fine. Comfy, a little sheer, fit is alright. That’s where the two stars come from. But, I received this shirt reeking of perfume, tied in a knot in the back, and inside-out. It had clearly been fully worn (not just tried on), sloppily returned, and then re-sold at full price without any inspection. Disgusting, and irresponsible in the middle of a pandemic."
2.0,Frames broke in first few weeks.
2.0,Really small and has a side zipper on pants. Is not indicative of an XL more like a M-L at best. Size up up up for this. I’m comfortably in a size 14 and the XL wouldn’t even come together at my side let alone zip lol
2.0,Ribbing of elastic is extremely uncomfortable- straps dig in - and I am petite/small framed.
2.0,"Bought these pants for a Halloween costume for my son, they looked great, however, the pants smelled like fish, he got to wear them only once, they ripped at the seam of the hip near the belt loop, the silver also wore off on the rear of the pants. Great looking pants, very poor quality."
2.0,Nice leather belt but unfortunately the buckle broke the second day of use. The part that goes into the hole to hold the belt broke off. Can lo longer be used at this point. I purchased this during a lightning deal and got a good price. $10 isnt a huge loss but still disappointed. I was going to buy a brown one as well perhaps a size smaller but now I'm hesitant because of the buckle failure
2.0,I’m not a fan of this romper. The material looks soft like sweatshirt in the photos but it’s a firm linen like material in real life. The fit is odd- also not as picture.
2.0,"I generally post pictures, but this photo would have been highly inappropriate based on how tiny these pants were. I wear a size 10 in pretty much everything. I ordered a 10 thinking if it was a little small, I could always exchange them. These were so tiny I could only get them up to about my knees. I would have had to go up about 3 sizes to MAYBE get a size that I could actually try on. Very disappointing."
2.0,Need to wear fast before getting rusty lol
2.0,"I know it was cheap, but this costume was REALLY cheap. For one thing, all of the finish edges of the fabric had just the edge stitching on it from the fabric supplier, that is, the stitch they put on the edge of the fabric to keep the fabric from fraying and coming apart. The fabric itself was really awful quality, and tore easily. The seams should have been concealed, but they were all exposed, making the costume look as if it were inside-out. This costume didn't last more than two wearings. I guess you get what you pay for, but come on, seller, you can do better than this."
2.0,"Material not as expected, very shiny."
2.0,I was really looking forward to this product but mine only came with one cup therefore making it useless for the wedding I needed it for. Not happy!
2.0,This necklace is gorgeous but it arrived with a broken clasp..........so disappointing!
2.0,Run way small and material is very very thin.... Cute but hopefully they actually fit my toddler
2.0,I was excited to get these because they're different. When I got them the ears were not gold and the eyes are cheap and not aligned properly. I'll still wear them but hope that no one gets too close to notice details.
2.0,Doesn’t stay in place well and is hot
2.0,"I like the style. The shoe looked very nice in the photos. I love the lining, it is very  warm.  The fit isn't flattering. The shoe  is very wide, so the shoe had major gaps around the ankle. My heel wasn't supported and this caused discomfort. I ordered a size 11."
2.0,These shorts were more like biker shorts than what the picture had shown them. They fit around my waist but were tight around my thighs. The material looked very cheap compared to the pictures shown and the zipper pockets were very bulky and did not look nice. I personally would not wear these shorts in public.
2.0,"These are size 10-13, HUGE.  This was not indicated on the site."
2.0,The suit is well made with vibrant colors and a convenient back zip but unfortunately we never got past the trying on because of the inaccurate size description for this item. I ordered size 5-6 for my 3.5 year old boys who weigh about 45 lbs and are about 40 inches in height. The suit barely fit and the legs especially were so tight that the fabric dug into the skin. The suit is intended for kids 46-53 lbs and 48-49 inches tall so clearly they need to revise their size descriptions.
2.0,"I have a larger head. Unfortunately, this hat does not accommodate that. I will gift it to someone with an average sized head."
2.0,"Wore this once, it’s really comfy. Washed it once and sone of the buttons disappeared so can’t  wear it again."
2.0,I have an average size head and this was way too tight.
2.0,"These are horrible. They have a super tight band around the very top, so very uneven compression around the tummy. The material is shiny and see through even when not stretched. So soooo sooooooo bad. Don’t do it."
2.0,Very cute tennis shoes but first time we try on the tongue of one came off.
2.0,"Ordered a size up and still snug, ordering 2 sizes up and we’ll see.  Love the look, hate the fit"
2.0,"These items began unraveling their seams and large holes appeared from the seams.  They are not well made, and it was too late to return them.  Their older counterparts have held together over the last couple of years with none of the issues these new ones have.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk I guess."
2.0,It took forever to get this product. Its not great quality fabric kind of rough for a baby.
2.0,"I normally wear a size medium, so I expected the size large to a bit loose. However, the sweater felt too small. I like the style and fabric the sweater, but I'm way too old for a sweater to be cropped this much to expose half my belly. It's ok, if I wear a tank top underneath, but I do have to say that the sweater sizing is really off, and maybe going 2 sizes up would be ok. The short mid-sleeves are cute, not so cute is the way too short hem of the sweater.."
2.0,Returned.  Didn't like material.
2.0,These are not true to size. I’m usually a 9-ish. Ordered the 10 so I’d have room if I wanted to wear them with fuzzy socks and they won’t even fit my heel in the shoe with a bare foot.
2.0,Some of the charms arrived with their stringing loop broken off so they cannot be used for jewelry making. Also many are one offs so if you are wanting matching earrings order more than one pkg.
2.0,"Very Pretty, but very large!  I sent it back.  Adjustment string didn’t work for my head."
2.0,Arch support in the wrong spot.
2.0,Fits too small!! Order two pairs of shoes small size 9 this one didn’t fit way too small.
2.0,This skirt was so cute and I absolutely loved it.... For a week... Then the zipper broke. It was a really cheap zipper and now it's in my see pile and will probably sit there for years until I get around to.changing the zipper.
2.0,"The material is cheaply made, does not feel soft on the skin and also not much stretch."
2.0,La tela es muy delgada! Temo no protegerá a mi hija tanto del frío como sus otras pjs Definitivamente no me gusto
2.0,"after washing it fell apart, its a shame because it was so cute my chid wore it once"
2.0,Style is ok but to big.  Nose part sitts too low.  Would not recommed.
2.0,I'd return them if I could. They run small in my opinion. And i'd probably look for something with more spandex and less cotton.
2.0,The only prob is that There super thin.
2.0,"Some of the crosses were bent and when I tried to bring them back into shape, they broke."
2.0,"My daughter was so excited to receive these shoes. They worked great for about 2 weeks, then random lights would light up a different color than the rest. Now the wire covers have fallen off. Crap shoes for only having them a month. Very disappointed as my daughter saved up her money to purchase them."
2.0,Received earlier than expected and i love them! They fit perfect. Just enough room to wear over my jeans. I usually wear a 71/2-8 US and i bought a 6 UK.Thanks:)<br />update: They only lasted one season. Cracked on sides of feet. Not worth the money. They were cute though. Disappointed.
2.0,Made of a simple cloth rather than the flow material that appeared in the photo. It does not fall loosely off the body but rather hangs straight down and sticks to your hips and stomach.
2.0,"I hated the material of this sweater and it doesn’t fall like it does in the pic, it’s pretty stiff. I’ll be getting rid of mine"
2.0,My mistake in ordering these as they were much more suspenders than my husband needed. Had to return. Product was as described.
2.0,It wouldn't stay up on my face.  Kept falling down.
2.0,"The first problem I had was that the upper part of the dress was way too tight. I am 5'2&#34; tall and weight 177lbs. and have always worn an X-large in most clothes--but especially sleepwear and that is what I bought this dress for. I have a hard time finding comfortable gowns with pockets so I look for dresses such as this one to use as a gown. I could hardly get this dress down over my body because the chest area and the shoulders were so tight. But that is not what really upset me the most. What really upset me was the way that the arms felt--it felt as if someone had poured fiberglass into the arms of the dress. I instantly started itching. I thought maybe if I kept it on for a few minutes that it would quit feeling itchy. But after about 5 minutes I felt as if I were going to go out of my mind if I didn't take this dress off. Needless to say after I removed it I found a rash on my arms--I must have had an allergic reaction to something that the sleeves are made out of. I have never had any clothing to do this to me before.<br /><br />Thankfully Amazon has great customer service. Tomorrow UPS is coming to my house to pick up the dress and return it. No charge for return shipping. The reason I have stayed a prime member for 12 years with Amazon is because they have always bent over backwards to make fix a problem & this time was no different.<br /><br />Update: 12/16/2017<br /><br />Shortly after I wrote the above review, Viishow got in touch with me and said that they were sorry to hear that the dress was too tight and that I instantly started itching. They offered me replacement of one of their other dresses that they thought would fit the criteria I was looking for. I took them up on their offer and it was the best thing I ever did! I loved the dress that they sent. I wanted something to sleep in that was roomy and comfortable and had pockets—this was exactly what I was looking for. The new dress feels like a cloud is covering my body—that is just how soft it is— and no itching! I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to many things and I think that was why I had the reaction to the dress I originally bought. Since no one else had this problem I presume that they were not allergic to the material. The replacement dress is stretchy and molds in the right places and glides around my body where it should. I am 5’2” & weight 177lbs. and the X-large fits me just right. It is a little below my knee but that is alright because I just wanted it to sleep in. I plan on buying more of these dresses in the future. This company has very good customer service—they sounded as if they really cared. Here is the link to the new dress that Viishow sent to me:<br />https://www.amazon.com/VIISHOW-Pockets-T-shirt-sleeves-Navy/dp/B0765QHZ1D/ref=sr_1_56?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1511923338&sr=1-56&nodeID=7141123011&psd=1&keywords=dress+with+pockets"
2.0,If you are a size 20/22 the largest size is too small for you.
2.0,"The bag is very cute and fits a lot, however the strap broke the very first time I used it while walking through an airport terminal."
2.0,"This dress is very cute. The style is attractive, but the hemline is not flattering. It’s awkward looking largely because the fabric is so lightweight. The overall effect is that the dress feels cheap to me. I’d much prefer a bit thicker fabric with a more flowing hemline."
2.0,"The material the dress is made of seems to be not of such good quality. The picture of the dress makes the skirt appear to be much less stiff, but the actual fabric is pretty stiff and almost starchy so that it doesn't flow or lay like it should on the body."
2.0,"bought it for my little sister, who normally wears an XL due to her above average height. The dress is great, but it is surprisingly tight around the chest and waist, but very big and long from the waist down."
2.0,I love this brand. But it wasn’t cotton. I returned it. Go prime.
2.0,"It's a nice earring but the cute round balls are a little too big. If it was smaller, I definitely would have kept it. Too bad I has to return it."
2.0,"I have never been excited for a belt until I purchased this one. Ingenious design and looks good. Alas, a few months in and the ratchet mechanism isn't locking anymore..."
2.0,I like the hoodie-- except the color I got isn't the color that's in the picture. Disappointed
2.0,This belt was not what I truly was expecting. I don’t like that I have to have slack on my belt as I tighten it.
2.0,"I love an over sized sweatshirt, like really over sized, but this was just all wrong. The feel of the sweatshirt was rough on the outside but soft on the inside. I went with a large since I have other Russel sweatshirts and the size is totally different. The arms are ridiculously HUGE! Like so big I’m sending it back! I literally felt like I had wings!  So back to Amazon it goes..."
2.0,"The idea behind this is wonderful, the execution however, was horrific, weird material that allows no breathability or room to wear underwear or a bra underneath without everyone knowing what you've got on."
2.0,"Looks okay, fits strangely"
2.0,It could have been wider.
2.0,The material is great. BUT it’s extremely flimsy and the ruffles fall down. It looks really awkward on. I returned this.
2.0,"Package of 3 pants. In 2 of the packages the items had only 2 with the size as orered and 1 item in a smaller size. Very concerned that this mistake happened in not only 1 but 2 of the 3 set packages. My friend was also concerned with the quality of the elastic in the waistband. Not only of poor quality but also very narrow elastic. Pants were also short, came well above ankles when sitting down."
2.0,"Dress was lovely but after even reading the reviews and buying a larger size, the dress would not fit over my chest area--very disappointed.  Great price though."
2.0,Re-ordered it twice. My regular size is XXL for last 5-6 years. When received first item it was at list 5X! Returned it and order XL. Came in with same result! The difference was only the lable on it! Now waiting on Large size. When received L size (size I was wearing at college!) it was good..
2.0,"Very cute but ran small, I bought the large and it was tight"
2.0,"It’s a nice top, nice idea, kinda poorly executed, I don’t know if maybe my boobs were too big(34C) but the bottom of the top isn’t fitted as much as I hoped so it hangs open in the front and hugs my back. Also the method of putting it on is pretty awkward there’s a zipper on the side but it doesn’t zip all the way up. The worst thing about this top is definitely the cheap material of it. It feels kinda like the top layer swimsuit material If it was dry. It cuts pretty high up as well maybe about two to three inches below my bra line but it could be that my boobs are too big but they are pretty small."
2.0,"I used them this past winter in ILLINOIS, and my fingers were FREEZING!!!! Gloves are thick but within 5-10 minutes my fingers were FREEZING, and they were NOT worth the price."
2.0,Material very thin and cheap<br />Plus I had to order a larger size because it’s made smaller
2.0,Looks nice but will leave a green mark on your wrist. Not really appealing with the green tarnish mark and that's from wearing it twice.
2.0,"It's fabric is a tad too warm for summer...yet, it's a summer dress.  The design is not flattering.  The set-in waist is unattractive.<br /><br />The neckline is modest.  The straps wide enough to cover any straps beneath.  It's way too long.  I'm 5'4"" and it drags on the floor...I can wear something with a small heal and it seems to miss the ground, but barely.<br /><br />The color...more of a green teal than a blue teal.  the rust flowers are okay, but don't seem to blend well with the teal.<br /><br />The best thing is it has pockets!!!  It's not a very flattering dress.  It's not overly expensive.  It's just a dress...and I'm not going to wear it if I want to look good going out.  But it'll do for now and it seems well enough made to last a short while."
2.0,Loved the watch. But the hinge broke last night so now it won't close. Trying to return it.
2.0,"When I tried this on, it was not the length I desired or thought it was, it was shorter. Also the front lays kind of strange and makes you look bigger than what you are."
2.0,Too big. Not as shown in photos
2.0,Poor quality and color.
2.0,Ordered a size 5 for my 4 year old grandson. Returned because they were too small. Very disappointed because we got them to match the book.
2.0,Fairly uncomfortable.
2.0,I buy a lot of fishnet clothing and this set has been my most flimsy and got holes in it
2.0,Very cheep.
2.0,"This dress fit as expected, but isn’t very flattering. The material is not soft, but stiff. I was unsure of the color when I ordered it, but apricot turned out to be a like khaki type color."
2.0,Socks did not fit. I went by Sunfung's sizing guide on Amazon & I ended up with 2 socks I couldn't put on my feet. I sent the socks back.
2.0,Band is actually really nice however after a wearing for about 3 days straight the band color change (fading).
2.0,Socks are marked L for left foot  and R for right<br />Well both are marked L that I recieved<br />So someone out there has two R 's
2.0,I am not very happy with this product.  The first week part of the handle fell off and now it looks broken but it is still functionally. It is very difficult to close after opening.  You cannot get back into the umbrella sleeve with ease. I am very disappointed.  I did not return because I lost the piece I mentioned.
2.0,"I have a wide face, these glasses are too small for me."
2.0,"This thing worked well but it is small and not very adjustable so it will only fit and infant or a small toddler, I’d say any kidover 2 years old this would be too small. It fit my 15 month old fine but she also had a small head. Definitely wouldn’t fit a kid"
2.0,"Bought this for my crazed FNAF's daughter. She was so ecstatic to receive it. After only a couple uses the umbrella broke. A bit of wind bent the bars and snapped a couple others. I suppose if you only use it for a drizzle here and there, it would be fine, but we live in the Pacific NW and our rain is usually associated with a little or a lot of wind. On the day it broke, it was a gentle wind which tells me the product is just poor quality."
2.0,This necklace is so cute. My 11 year old loved it. Unfortunately the clasp fell off within the first week of wear. Sad she couldn’t enjoy it longer.
2.0,"I really liked the style of this suit.  I usually wear between a 12 and 14 so I went with the XXL (12-14) per size chart.  The suit was huge!  I ordered a different color in the XL (10-12).  It looked okay, but felt very uncomfortable."
2.0,They are a little bit to big
2.0,"These earrings are very cheaply made. There's no shine or sparkle to them. I've had them for a couple of months and there starting to turn green. Very disappointed in this purchase. Bought  another pair of huggies from this company and I love them!!! They were just a little too small, so I thought I'd try another pair, Sorry I did."
2.0,This is just sad cause I really was excited to wear this necklace- It was perfect coming out of the box. The trinket is actually heavy and weighs down on the chain. The chain itself felt slightly heavier than a regular gold chain so I thought it would be strong enough to hold the weight of the trinket.<br />WRONG! The moment I went to unclasp it and put it around my neck something snapped and the trinket part fell to the ground with a thud! I have no idea what happened. All I did was unclasp it as you would a regular necklace and now it is in 2 separate pieces. I would try and bend the links open to finagle a way to wear it but at this point who knows if those efforts are worth it considering how quick it broke and how heavy the jeweled trinket is! WASTE.
2.0,At first I loved the look of it. It was supposed to be for my 6 year old for her birthday BUT it was extremely small like for a toddler. I contemplated just giving it to my 2 year old niece but it was so see through. I returned it and got my money back
2.0,Was great until the hook broke.  Frustrating
2.0,2 pack to me meant 2 of each item.  I order kids grass skirts in a 2 pack and that's exactly what it was.<br />I wish I would of bought the colored skirts like I did for the kids it was cheaper and there were 2 paks just like<br />advertised.  I did think the quality was good but not the value for the $$.
2.0,Too small if busty. Only for small B cup and below
2.0,Liked the shirt but the size chart was way off. It was way too small.
2.0,I wan't to happy when I recieved it.. It looked like it was made very cheap.. But again I paid very cheap for it..
2.0,"The product arrived with the main compartment zipper broken/off its thread. What more do I need to say? I wanted to like this product -- it's cute and sporty -- but it's not great quality. And with a broken zipper, it's basically unusable."
2.0,Cute and all but by day three all the charms had broken off my crocs
2.0,"The body of the material is cheap and has zero elasticity. After a one hour barre class, the shoes became loose. The only thing that I like is the color. I have two other pairs from different sellers in the same design that are much better quality."
2.0,Canvas very thin and loose. Shows frame through. Looks like pencil drawing with watercolor over. Colors are nice though.
2.0,"This accidentally got put in the dryer, so it's probably my fault but this shrank so much I can't even wear it. It's really, really short now."
2.0,"This does not look like the picture. Very frumpy and unflattering.  It is thin  cheaply made , see through and the color was not purple but a light lilac.<br />Not worth the money."
2.0,Says its for a 0 to 6 most is not should been labeled  3 to 6 months. A new born baby can not fit this unless they are 15 lbs. My daughter is 1 mo and 10 lbs and its still too big.
2.0,Arrived scratched and paint was off on part of the buckle..
2.0,cute but I can't use them - too small.
2.0,Ok. Fit but thin
2.0,"Brown off-shoulder wrap dress, XL, 5’2.5, 200, 38DDD: The best part was delivery, dress arrived on time via Prime. Out of the bag it was crumpled and smelled a little smoky as if someone else had returned it. The color was not as dark as the brown one pictured, it was not shimmery, the fabric was thin and cheap, and there was only lining in the sleeves. It’s a no for me."
2.0,Doesn't stay in place so the butterfly always ends up upside down or sideways.
2.0,Super cute but runs small around the chest
2.0,"This item arrived and appeared to be brand new, however when inspecting the bag I noticed that it had small papers (wrappers) in it and crumbs in the bottom of the bag.  When the center pocket was unzipped there were more crumbs along with a charging brick for a phone or Ipad.  Very disappointed that this item was sold as new but it arrived clearly used."
2.0,This is a beautiful dress that runs really small.
2.0,"Love them. But they broke within 2 months with little wear. They stay in a glasses holder my car and are not treated harshly. Nose bridge broke in half. Really sad, they were my favorites"
2.0,It was to big but I loved the side pockets
2.0,These are way to big and to costumey
2.0,Totally love the size the product but will not stay latched.. a little disappointed..i bought this so it wouldn't fall out..
2.0,My head size is 6 1/8 and this cap is really tight
2.0,"I normally wear a large, the extra large was way too small"
2.0,"This seemed cute, and I ordered 2x my size, and while the gown itself was loose on me, the cup size was just way too small. Like sooooooo small."
2.0,Not to happy with the purchase. It helps the purpose of a touch screen but the gloves got fuzz balls very quick.
2.0,These glasses were sooo cute but Absolutely NOT oversized !  I ended up giving them to a 10 yr old in which they fitted her perfectly.
2.0,This dress is shorter in the front then the back.  I have NEVER liked dresses like that and the picture should be more clear.  length does not look like pic!
2.0,Cute dress. Will wear with leggings. Fabric is thin. Not high quality. Doubt I’ll get a lot of wear out of it.
2.0,I returned this. The fabric was awful - felt uncomfortable on my skin and was very unforgiving.
2.0,I have this exact dress in a yellow with white polka dots and I ordered it in a different pattern. It's a great cut and I love the patterns. Dress was just drastically smaller than the first one I bought and not consistent with sizing. Didn't even bother sending back for a refund because it's not very pricey.
2.0,"Does not look like the picture, was way too big. Sent it back because I did not think it was very attractive."
2.0,Actual Size smaller than stated
2.0,After first wash the strings were fraying bad
2.0,"No way does one size fit all!  I am short and heavy man and it is WAY too small. Fits my daughter who is 5 foot two and weighs 100 lbs!!  If you are king size, don't order this!  Material is nice though."
2.0,This is too small for the size that they say! But quality is good. Be carefully with sized!
2.0,I gave it 2 stars because its cute but that’s it. It was the color for me. Didn’t appear to be as silver as the picture and I have other silver color anklets on and that threw it off so I returned it.
2.0,Heavy glass frame should be lighter in weight needs a light glasses plastic holder. Lens is good<br />Thank you
2.0,"I cannot figure how to close them. They are very pretty but I can't wear them because they won't close, no matter what I try."
2.0,To small ordered a xxl wow must have been a child small.
2.0,Ex gf did
2.0,"I believe the product is true to the size.  However, when I put it on my 3.5 year old, he said it was itchy and would not keep the shoe on.  Inside of the shoe, where the tongue attaches, is a bump.  I could see how this was uncomfortable for him.  I'm returning the shoe for this reason."
2.0,So little. Do not buy.
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  These definitely look like costume jewelry.  I knew they wouldn't fool people, but they are huge, and look really cheap and tacky.  I bought a different set that was less than half this size and they look much better.  Quality is so-so.  The backs are very small and flimsy.  I accidentally pulled one earring right out of my ear while adjusting my headband.  I don't think I'll ever wear them anywhere."
2.0,Did not fit M frame. Nose piece doesn't fit. Had to return.
2.0,"Really oddly made. Fit way too big, the front part is huge. Just an ugly, I’ll-fitting shoe that looks nothing like the pic."
2.0,I thought I was getting clip on earrings but one the hoops are not clip on???? I like the single crystal ones but can't use the hoop ones!
2.0,Super disappointed.<br />Funnel too large to fit opening.<br />Needle is too flimsy and bends out of shape at the touch!<br />Space for ashes is toooo shallow to ACTUALLY hold anything!<br />Can't even be worn for fashion purposes as it came off iny hand while I was trying to screw the heart back on ... So total waste of money.<br /><br />The only reason it got two stars was Bec the package was cute.  Nice quality velvet bag which can be repurposed.  The concept is nice as they sent all the tools but NOT FUNCTIONAL don't waste your money if you're looking for bereavement jewelry....
2.0,The picture is deceiving. Sleeves were very short. Material was shiny. It was cute and fit ok except for sleeves
2.0,"Wrong size, difficult to return from Santo Domingo."
2.0,"Fabric is nice, the colors are lovely!  But I might as well borrow one of my husbands’ flannel shirts.  This “shacket” only covers the bottom.  It doesn’t go to the knees as shown.  I’m returning it🥹"
2.0,Couldn't use it to small to tight not true to size
2.0,"The buttons aren’t aligned correctly, the concept is great!"
2.0,Way too tight in all the wrong places!! I bought 4 Medium dresses and this was way more snug then any other dress. It has an awkward fit! I don’t even think it would make a difference to size up bc of the fit!
2.0,loved the look but fit wierd
2.0,Con este producto fui engañado
2.0,Shipped with a hole on the seam
2.0,I returned since it was tight in areas and loose in others making it not fit right. It is definitely see through and I wouldn’t recommend if you’re curvy.
2.0,Fit very small/short in length.
2.0,Strap is a bit wide for the buckle and it already fraying. I’ve had other Bison belts that were great but this one not so much.
2.0,It's a nice piece. The only issues I had with it was that the day that I wore it I already had the little diamonds falling out. It is very cheaply made. They did send replacements but they shouldn't fall out the day after you receive it. I've spent the same price on other pieces and I've received better quality than this.
2.0,Unimpressive for the cost. Neat design but they feel generic.
2.0,Gloves too small
2.0,Product runs super small . The colors are beautiful I must add . I ordered large being I am only 5’0” and wear medium but the large was still too small . I will need to lose 20lbs before I can even wear it lol. If you purchase just ensure you order at least 2-3 sizes up 🙁
2.0,This is not a champagne color it is a light plum. Do not buy if you are looking for champagne.
2.0,"NOTE: This sweater is DARK CREAM in color NOT WHITE and the neck seam on the left side was delivered frayed. Other than that, the product is as described.  Definitely runs large so size down from whatever you normally wear."
2.0,"These are too see through to be used as leggings but they do make nice footless tights. Color is slightly lighter than picture and more shiny than I expected but still very cute. Fit is comfy. Material is very warm, great for cool weather."
2.0,"Runs small, not very pretty compared to pic.  Still trying to return. Seller will not contact me."
2.0,This was sized for a child. Gave it to my three year old niece. It was soft with decent stretch though.
2.0,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM,,I GOT IT AND IT WAS GREAT,WEEKS LATER, I WENT OUT TO EAT WITH A LADY, AND IT JUST SEPERATED ON MY NECK ??? JUST CAME APART WITHOUT ANY PULLING ON IT,,IT JUST CAME APPART AND IT WAS 30INCHES,SO IT WAS'NT TIGHT ON MY NECK AT ALL, I WAS EMBARASED,,,I HAD TO PAY A JEWLER TO REATTACH IT...I STILL WHERE IT, BUT YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT WAS PUT BACK TOGEATHER...WOW...."
2.0,"I originally,  Gave this pair  a four until a few times of wearing them I developed crusty , irritated and infected ears . I believe I'm allergic to this type of steel . I won't purchase them again because my ears are sensitive."
2.0,pocket feel like swimsuit/cheap material and although the rips look fine online they come in a very awkward shape irl. also pretty long in length. seller was great though. can't return these so overall i wouldn't buy them and take the gamble.
2.0,they fir very loose
2.0,I liked the material. The gloves were just too short and wide. Not enough elasticity.
2.0,"This was bad on me.  Might be ok for a tall, skinny, younger person.  I'm 5'4, 125lbs, 32D and got a small.  Way too big in the top and arm holes.  It is unlined and very sheer.  The fabric and construction seem cheap.  The print is just straight up pink leopard (I thought it was an abstract dot type pattern).  Not flattering in person and I don't think it's age appropriate for me either (mid 30s)."
2.0,"Bought to have for missionary Sunday but sadly it was too small. I ordered a large, on the bag it stated that but on the inside hem it said XL..So this dress runs in Asian sizes! But it was beautiful I would have really liked to have it so I'm returning"
2.0,When it said “non-slip” it wasn’t referring to the bottom of the socks. There’s a rubber band around the ankle area to prevent it from slipping off your feet. But walking on wood flooring in these will provide no tracking. I was misled by the “non-slip” nomenclature.
2.0,"Okay, I feel bad writing this review. I get the concept of these pants but they present very differently online than they do in person. They are beyond huge. I typically wear a medium size and these are easily 5x bigger than what I could wear. They are also shorter in person than they appear. The style is quite a bit different than portrayed. I'm bummed because I waited so long for these and they take 50% restocking fee, plus shipping expenses so they aren't even worth returning, in my opinion.<br /><br />Beyond that, the quality is good...but if you are looking for a new carport, this is what you want to buy!"
2.0,waaaay to large
2.0,Needed a larger size however decided to cancel
2.0,Frame too small - the picture provided shows it’s large in size
2.0,A little long didnt love. Sadly. Really cute at top tho. Fits good. Just too much material at bottom. Quite flowy if you want that.
2.0,"I work at a school, and we all ordered the sizes according to our size.  Every one of our dresses are far too large.  The small that I ordered is more like a Medium.  The Medium that our nurse bought is more like a large, and the dress my principal ordered size large is more like an extra large.  Thankfully we are only using these dresses for a school Christmas skit."
2.0,I like the top the pants were huge they look fitted in the picture but they are not very wide the Leg part...
2.0,It was cute enough but even after sizing up it was still way beyond too small. I normally where a Medium so I got a Large and I couldn't even close the buttons. I guess a XXL but I cringe to think what the length would be. Returning and finding something with more consistent sizing.
2.0,"Cute and fits well through the shoulders and body; however, it's VERY short. My daughter wears it with leggings but when a 5 year old says, ""I think it's kinda short, Mom,"" you know theres a problem."
2.0,It was ok. Didn't really like it after I received it!
2.0,"The material felt very nice and the gage was perfect. The packaging was also very nice, But the bottom part of the L shape wasn't long enough to actually hook in my nose. So I wasn't able to use them and ended up stopping by the mall and searching for a different one last minute."
2.0,They look great but are very heavy & become painful after wearing for an hour.
2.0,"Wayyyy too loose around the waist. My daughter is outgrowing her size 6 leggings, but judging from reviews, I ordered the 4-6 size in these to be safe, especially because she is skinny. Well, the leggings were literally falling off of her around the waist. The legs weren't a bad fit, and if she wasn't so sensory sensitive, I might have taken them in at the waist and called it a day, but she would never tolerate that. She said the material felt good, wasn't too scratchy or too soft, and if they had a smaller size, like a 2-4, it might have worked for my 8 year old, but they don't."
2.0,The sleeves are super short and not tight around the wrist area. The letters were stuck together when got it.
2.0,"The shoes are cute and they fit well. After the second wear, I could here air escaping every time I stepped down. The pictures are after the 3rd wear. The cork is separated from the bottom and now sliding off the sides."
2.0,If you're thicker than a snicker these leggings are not for you. I looked like a busted can of biscuits in these things. No to mention my air supply was almost cut off. Needless to say if you need weight loss motivation buy the leggings & it'll show just how unfit you are. Thanks tiktok now I'm fasting from now on.
2.0,"I was expecting this item to be  much bigger, it actually looks fake  and as for making me luckier in games of chance, it  did  not.Another  waste of money."
2.0,"The earring hooks to keep earrings in your ears are not long enough and do not stay closed.  While earrings are pretty, this problem wont allow you to wear the earrings without them falling out and losing them.  Very disappointed in how these earrings were made and even worse sent out to a new customer"
2.0,"Light and sheer. Not as long shown in the picture. Quality is definitely cheap. Shipped from China, took over month to get here."
2.0,"I have a 26 inch waist, and this belt doesn't stretch at all when I put it on. The hook is really loose and without the tension from the stretch, it won't stay closed, so it's basically useless. I could wear it lower than my natural waist, but I bought it to wear with dresses so that's not really what I was going for. It wouldn't be too difficult to make it so that it could stay closed even when it's on loosely. I'm disappointed that I can't use these, because they really are beautiful."
2.0,"Cute dress and soft material. Really wanted it in white for a beachy boho look, but instead I looked like a busy choir singer. 36D, hour glass figure. Hoping another color can give me a boho look."
2.0,"This set is aesthetically pleasing and does allow you to use any touchscreen easily, but they are meant for a windy or brisk day - not for truly cold weather.  On an average cold winter day in the northeast I had to go back home from a walk and put on actual winter hat and gloves.  The headband piece is also made for someone who has more of a round face than a long face, as the ears were higher up on my head because my face is oval."
2.0,"Ahhh, I really wish I could write a good review for this product.  I was super excited to get this in the email.  It was a gift for my boyfriend's mom. This product is a big disappointment. I'm giving it a 2 star instead of 1 because it at least fit properly. However, the color is very very light. It is so much lighter than what it's shown in the picture. I wonder if they Photoshop the picture to make it look brighter than it is.  I attach a picture for you to see how light it really is. I would not recommend buying this product. For 60 bucks, you can find a much nicer product elsewhere.  Don't waste your money folks."
2.0,Runs soooo small.
2.0,The packaging was so poor and the belt has a weird chemical smell to it. Not for a long term use.
2.0,Broken on the second day of wearing it
2.0,These all came unraveled in less than a week - very poor quality .
2.0,The colors were supposed to be more vibrant as in the picture but the cheapness of the fabric took away from the whole shirt.
2.0,Broken zipper already!
2.0,"at first I really liked these, but they are not worth it if they just fall apart (in the storage case!)"
2.0,Is not anti fog
2.0,"""Regular Straight Fit"" came as Regular Fit. I was looking for the straight fit, not regular. I don't want all that baggy extra fabric. Buying pants online has been a bad experience and this order has done nothing to change my opinion."
2.0,The outfit was really cute but it wayyyy too big. I ended up having to tie it in the back.
2.0,"Looks great, but the stud backs fall off constantly. Lost both in less than a month."
2.0,Looks raggedy.
2.0,Disappointingly short.
2.0,faded quickly
2.0,"The quality of these was average.  They are not very soft but they do keep my baby warm. They appear to run small, I found the 0-3 Month size fit like a newborn outfit would."
2.0,They are white in color more than yellow
2.0,"Buddha is ok, but don't like the cord"
2.0,"One review said that they fit weird and weren't comfortable. I couldn't say it better myself. Pay heed. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of their 1, but only because they could be worse."
2.0,"Was really excited to get this band. Specifically picked it because it was grey and would match with more. When it came it, it was purple."
2.0,The fabric rolls off face. Great if only used as a neck covering.
2.0,This is a handsome watch although the band does not stand up to daily wear.. But I love it
2.0,Meant for tiny glasses. Mine doesn’t fit
2.0,Quality not that great. The plastic to hold it in the shoe broke the first day wearing them which left the lace no good.
2.0,"fit was good, but metal hooks to fasten were flimsy, tore right out the fabric."
2.0,Zipper broke after one day. But they fit well and were confortable but cant wear them anymore.
2.0,It is important to measure per the size chart. The photo shows the size small compared to a normal kids small pants.<br />The picture is also not clear and there is no color in the description. I thought it was black but it’s actually dark blue.
2.0,"I was dissapointed with this, it's like a pancho not a shirt at all, you just put it over your head and it's open on both sides, not what I was expecting at all"
2.0,"Shirt runs small, weird smell…. I did like the pants, great material and soft, good fit…… still had weird smell"
2.0,looked bad on.
2.0,"Ordered the necklace on September 25th and got it on November 3rd. In the description it said that I wouldn't get it for 12-20 days, but I'm not rating this based on shipping. It came in once piece which is always fantastic. It seems like a very nice necklace. It seems sturdy, but the pendant is too heavy for the rose part. It pulls the rose down and the whole thing kind of folds over on itself...<br />Geez: now, just picking it up, the rose fell off the red part. It was only superglued on. I now have plans to use the the lady on the pendant to make my own necklace with a chain I'll buy from the store. For the awesome price, it's totally worth it to buy a separate chain if you're looking for this kind of Victorian pendant."
2.0,"The metal is so weak it just bends.  The first time I wore it on my pinky, the bottom flattened out.  I was just working at my desk."
2.0,It was broken when I got  it
2.0,"The band is nice, however it very easily catches on things causing it to come unlatched and falling off the wrist. This continues to happen and and if not for a couple of honest people I would not have noticed my watch had fallen on the ground."
2.0,Three weeks into using it for occasional jogging and gym sessions a part of the left sole came off. Bad quality.
2.0,"The fit is okay, a little small. I don't think I could wear something under it. My real issue is how the sweater was packaged and the state it was in when I opened it up.<br /><br />First, there was a bunch of shredded/ripped up, what looked like, paper mache and it made a huge mess all over my floor. I had to take it outside and shake it out just to get it all off because it was also clinging to the sweater itself.<br /><br />The second issue is that there was clearly dirt/mud on what would be the left side of the chest and collar.<br /><br />Completely unprofessional."
2.0,Doesn't drape as well as the models.
2.0,"the first time my son wore this it fit him well, after washing it once, its now too small..."
2.0,"I liked the dress, color and delivery time BUT it was too small. I usually wear a medium but this medium on me didn't work. I returned it and was disappointed they didn't have a large in green."
2.0,I like the shoe but couldnt get my sons foot in there for nothing he screamed
2.0,Just ok......will stick with the other brand I know and trust.
2.0,"I bought these to help me walk around a vineyard venue as a bridesmaid during my friend's wedding. The slot for the heel was too wide for my stilettos. Luckily, the bride needed something like this and the product kind of fit the bride's heels, so she found them useful during the after-ceremony photos.<br /><br />I don't hate them, but I personally would not purchase them again."
2.0,"I loved the shoes, however, my foot is very small (I'm a size 4.5 but can get into a 5 if they run small), therefore, being on a 5&#34; heel it slid forward causing the shoes to look too large in the back. They are a great looking shoe and I am so disappointed that I have to return them. They are very comfortable though. No complaints othere than I wish I had a normal size foot. Lol"
2.0,"The earrings are as shown except the photo does a poor job indicating how short the post is, as if these earrings were meant for kids. Also the odd configuration on the backs (encased in plastic and half dome shaped) makes sliding the backs onto the short post a challenge. If I had been able to see the earrings first, those two features would have made me pass on purchasing them."
2.0,Brim was all scuffed...
2.0,This was nice but much bigger than I expected.  It is well made and very useful if you have room.
2.0,These boots are very nice and may be best for hiking but are not waterproof. My kids wore them out in the snow 1 time and came in with their socks soaked.
2.0,Aweful fabric
2.0,2 out of 5 necklaces were not broken. The cords came out of the poorly glued clasp/caps. I'm yet to see if the remaining will hold up to wear or break like the others. Cord necklaces were very nice in appearance.
2.0,stuff falls out from under the elastic straps...... and it was supposed to have 1 strap on each side. but mine was missing one.
2.0,"I was so excited to get this outfit because I had an all black event to attend it came really quickly but when I received mines it has a hole in it so I had to run around town trying to find something else to wear to the all black event I will be returning and requesting my money back, my feeling were so hurt"
2.0,Be careful..the dress is great in quality well made and stylish but it'seems only made for VERY short waisted women.  I really wanted it to fit better..
2.0,These shoes are MUCH lighter in person than depicted online. I haven't been able to wear them yet as I don't have an outfit that I love that will go with the color they actually are.
2.0,I open it...it was hard to open.  Then...really awkward you would have to paste the pictures?  It is different and pretty.  Because I change my jewelry so much...time will tell if this is stainless steel.
2.0,"This wouldn't be a terrible dress, if a dress is what I wanted, but I wanted a skirt so this is kind of disappointing. Top of the dress fits a bit snug for a medium, but the waist and bottom of the dress are find. But, again, this is a dress, not a skirt."
2.0,"Sizing is way off. It said “fits 8-13”, but they were too small on my daughter, who is a size 10.5. Otherwise they were cute"
2.0,Washed pant went outside and realized had a 6 inch hole in leg.
2.0,these were not long enough to go through my piercing.
2.0,Its a huge piece. Chain hang down to my naval. Decent quailty. Cute but bigger than I expected.  Oh well
2.0,Not sized properly. Returned with no problem
2.0,"Runs large, also really thin material"
2.0,"So disappointed in the material. Pajamas should be soft and comfortable, especially for a little girl. These are stiff and so hard."
2.0,dress fits however it is not designed for the shoulders to lay as they do in the picture
2.0,The lenses were ok. They fit the frames properly. The clarity was not so good.
2.0,Watch was beautiful just way way to big for my wrists abd it was way to hard to remove links
2.0,Pants weren't the color at showed in the picture. And they ran a little small.
2.0,The band has to be synched very tight to prevent the buckle from raising up and not seating.  If you don't then it catches on things because it's protruding so much.
2.0,"I bought these blue-gray Nike Men's Marxman shoes to go with my 1981 DeLorean, no kidding. They look rather like the pseudo-futuristic &#34;Air Mag&#34; shoes seen in &#34;Back to the Future Part II.&#34; I liked the style so much that I bought Marxmans in two different colors. (You may see my review for the Light Bone version nearby.) What I found was that these shoes look great in advertising photos but absolutely do not fit on a human foot. I may be weird in some respects but my foot construction is 100% normal and the strap over the arch is just too short to work right. And it is apt to come loose when you walk, which really kills the fun. I am also finding that they do not age well at all. A couple of months into wearing them only occasionally, and they are looking really warped, with folds scarred into the leather like years-old sneakers or driftwood. It kills the futuristic effect and ruins the look of the smooth design. I badly wanted to love this shoe and I hope Nike re-designs this style to be functional."
2.0,Very small and uncomfortable.  Would be ok for a child or animal.
2.0,"When they say this runs small, it runs really small. I got the black one in an x-large (the largest size available in that color) and I normally wear a medium. It was so tight that it didn't even matter that the laces can be threaded looser or tighter, the overall shape of the thing was like it was supposed to fit a child."
2.0,This is not a sweatshirt material feels more like 100% polyester. This shirt does not have any stretch to it but the colors are vibrant and the graphics are cute! Runs small so size up!
2.0,Too big and the ear cuff does not stay put on the upper ear.  It flops off
2.0,I'm not in love with these. I got a similar pair from another company that have worked better. This pair doesn't stay on as well as the others and the battery life sucks. One of the lights goes dim within a few minutes of replacing the batteries. I do like that you can set them to flashing or solid and the light color changes.
2.0,It's a cheap watch.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"The helmet arrived a bit disformed overall. Not sure if something heavy was placed on it during shipping or why it was warped and off center. The translucent nose piece was buckling up when it arrived. It was close to Halloween when it arrived, so I didn’t really have time to send it back or I would have.<br /><br />The plastic also cracked the first time I used it while I was taking it off my head.<br /><br />I’m pretty disappointed with the quality for the price. It’ll still look OK collecting dust on my shelf and the costume was a hit. Otherwise it would only get one star."
2.0,"The fabric on this is nice, but I purchased it on a flash sale and it was not listed as being a slim fit suit.  The stitching is good quality as well.  Just remember that THIS IS A SLIM FIT SUIT EVEN IF THE COPY DOES NOT DISCLOSE THAT FACT.  Order your sizes"
2.0,"I had to return this hat as it was folded up so tightly and flat that I couldn't get the wrinkles out of the brim enough to make it wearable.  Luckily I also ordered the exact same hat but in a solid color from Qu yu jie mao on Amazon and that one came flat packed so I've been able to wear it. It's the same exact brand and hat, except in a solid color. It's really cute!"
2.0,It was nice.. but too big for a size small
2.0,Clock always stops and the thing doesn't clasp shut.
2.0,"My pair matched in color, but the bezel was only around the edge and not on the face of the plug. Even though I am disappointed by the bait and switch, I was going to keep them but one of the pair was chipped/broken."
2.0,"Way too big and it fell apart within a few weeks. Cute, but eh. Whish it were more sturdy."
2.0,"I ordered 2 pair of the same earrings and got one pair in the size expected and one “mini-me” pair! They are not even remotely close in size!<br /><br />On a positive note, the pair that is in the correct size is super cute."
2.0,"One of the earring backs  on the black pair earring keeps falling off, it’s very loose.<br /><br />Tomekia England"
2.0,Very pretty but non-functional. Just kept tangling up all night. Eventually had to take it off.
2.0,After rinsed lot of tint came out from the shirt
2.0,"My husband saw it and asked for it for Christmas. It did ship in a timely fashion, hence the two stars. I was so disappointed in the fabric quality, and especially the zipper quality, when I opened it, that I returned it immediately. It’s cheaply made with a clunky zipper that doesn’t run smoothly. Don't bother."
2.0,La calidad no es nada buena
2.0,"It was a little big. The straps would consistently fall down my arms, but it was really cute."
2.0,"It’s a cute bikini, but the top isn’t designed correctly and it doesn’t lay flat against your skin. Not suitable for swimming. Might be suitable for laying on the beach and not moving. One false move and there’d be a nip slip."
2.0,had to send back-size not accurate
2.0,Picture makes the ring look larger than it is. You need a magnifying glass to see the compass.
2.0,There were bubbles in the letters and the metal is very thin.
2.0,"It was beautiful, fit ok, nice heavy t-shirt material, not that thin see through, but the lace was sewn on improperly, and there was a torn place in that lace. I will order again, and believe the next one will be examined before shipping"
2.0,According to my girlfriend the tigereye is completely brown without yellow. I have to admit that I wasn't happy to hear the word sphincter associated with my Christmas gift.
2.0,Received only the lime shirt
2.0,Material is lowsey
2.0,My biggest issue is the sequins is not the metallic (silver?) color shown. It was a pink that matched the dress. Super dissatisfied in this one as it’s not as shown or described
2.0,"It didn't fit as well as I'd hoped. I love the colors but the design just isn't as flattering as in the pics. The material was a bit think for me considering I live in Florida and I'm about to go the whole summer being really pregnant. I ordered the XL and it seemed a little big but at the same time was a bit short.  I'm 5'6 about 185lbs and 19 weeks along. I hated that you can feel the seams on the inside of the dress. That, on top of it being just to big and unflattering and the material being too thick, I've decided to return the dress so I can purchase another lighter, More flattering dress. I was disappointed Bc the XL size in all the other dresses I've ordered have fit great. That, and I was really hoping this would fit Bc it's so cute in the pics."
2.0,"Definitely not a gaiter and definitely not seamless. This is a square chiffon (see through) scarf that has been folded in half with a matching face mask with elastic ear loops attached to it. Here's the thing...i kind of dig it. It works perfectly for the office and acts as a way for me to quickly cover my face before addressing clients.<br /><br />But again, this is not protective at all. Is not a gaiter and is not seamless. It's a mediocraly fashionable scarf that meets the facemask mandate requirement 🤷‍♀️"
2.0,The material is like paper and very wrinked
2.0,"Edit!!<br />After less than a week of wearing these they are losing their gold color in spots!! See my second picture. So disappointed<br /><br />Original: I’ve been wanting gold stacking rings for a long time and this RLMOON 3 pcs 14k gold filled set exceeds my expectations!! They are so pretty! They are exactly the same size to be a perfect fit. The two that are plain both have ‘14k GF’ stamped on the inside. As gold is a very soft metal, I know that everyday scratching is to be expected. I have been wearing them for a few days and I actually don’t see any scratches yet. These are very high quality for the price and I highly recommend"
2.0,"After just a few uses for surfing the strap is slipping of off one side of the frame. Only reason I have not lost them is I have a surf hat on top of them. In the few sessions I was able to use them, they did help cut glare in bright afternoon conditions. Thinking about super glue, but not sure how the rubber part of the strap will respond."
2.0,"I got a size 24 in this shirt, since I’d gotten a 26 in a different one and it was too big.<br />This one is justthismuch too small for my preference. But it’ll do after a wash and air dry."
2.0,I had ordered A half-size up because they ran small. I'm returning these because the  foot bed and arch fits weirdly. The arch is too far back towards the heel.
2.0,"Patterns didn't match up at the seams, and the seams are poorly sewn together."
2.0,"I liked the style of the earrings very much and wanted to keep them.  They were inexpensive, but not even worth the $7.99 that I paid.  When received, they were scratched on both earrings on the small round top part.  Can't imagine what would have happened if I actually wore them!  Nice style, poor quality."
2.0,The seller was as cooperative as possible being that they are overseas but both sizes I got do not fit in the slightest. If you are not a child or size 0-4 these won't fit. I got a 4x the 2nd time and normally wear a 12 so per the chart that should be accurate. It's still about 2-3 dress sizes too small. Not anything bad about the company. Dress was great quality. Just no chance of ever being able to wear it.
2.0,These jeans were like at least 2 sizes smaller than make. I gave them away to my daughter's boyfriend.
2.0,It's too big and looked trashy on me. It's not as shiny in person and the day after I changed it it got all infected
2.0,"Material was soft and cozy, but a hole developed at stitching in the shoulder after two washes."
2.0,"The tassels at the bottom are really messy on this dress and not as neat as in the picture. I would say it definitely runs big. Also, there's a giant noticeable sew right where the tag is. The fabric is super soft and I love the color but it just looks like a poor quality dress. Definitely returning."
2.0,"I love the bracelets, extremely disappointed that one bracelet broke already :("
2.0,"I bought a 10 pack of these balls with the hopes of wearing them on my industrial. The two I used from the package have already lost their gems and are instead open on the ends and rough-feeling. I can only assume that this will happen with the other 8 balls in the package. I will say that the size is excellent. Very tiny and still fits on a 14g barbell. I'm still using them, they just don't look as pretty without the gems."
2.0,The proportions on this shirt are way off. I bought an XL (I'm top heavy 38DD) and the design is really wide but very short in length. Not a fan.
2.0,I like them but one of the back pockets was not sewn on.
2.0,"Ordering bras online is always a risky proposition - it looks great on the model, but because you're built differently, it may fit poorly. Such is the case with this bra - the padding is much too thick, in my opinion, for someone who's already 36D - it made my breasts bulge out even more. Also the cups aren't wide enough, so I was spilling out in the middle. Technically it fits but the lack of wide cups and unnecessary padding make it unlikely that I'll wear this more than once."
2.0,"I loved the packaging, however, these earrings are too large and as a result, they are more appro. for a girl or child. I could not get past the thought that they look like the toy earrings my mom purchased for me to play dress up. I guess it depends on taste and style, but for me they were too big."
2.0,Cheep plastic frames. They broke within a week of the wearing just one pair. The lenses are really nice though
2.0,I thought they would make everything yellow--lighter so I could see better--like they show on TV but they don 't.
2.0,"Our child wears a toddler size 5 in other pairs of shoes that we have, but the size 5 in these was waaay too big.  We even measured our child's feet to ensure the right size, but no luck.  We returned them."
2.0,Purchase ONLY if you are using it on a doll or a 6-month old baby.
2.0,They were pretty but turn black and almost 2 weeks and had to take them off
2.0,Item broke within 30 min of using it.
2.0,Does not hold up to the extreme cold weather☹️
2.0,"I bought two pairs from different vendors. Same size just different color. This particular pair fits extremely large whereas the other fits perfecty. This leads me to doubt as to the originality of the product. Also, in the picture the emblem or logo is on the outside of the shoe and the ones I got have it on the inside.<br />Not very happy at all."
2.0,This skirt was actually really pretty and fit TTS. I had to return because they added a Chinese medicine pouch for preservative purposes but it smelt so bad. I couldn’t stomach the smell and wasn’t going to risk washing it and the smell not coming out.
2.0,Items are okay. My daughter really liked them but they do break easily so she was a little upset that they aren't sturdy like most anklet bracelets.
2.0,"The material was sturdy and had a nice weight to it. I ordered a large based on the sizing guide and it was extremely tight on me. Also, there was no tag to identify which way you should put it on. I would suggest buying 2 sizes bigger than what you would normally get."
2.0,I love everything about this dress... except the super weird pleat right in the front over the belly button. Accentuates the worst part of a mama's body and just looks strange. Rest of the dress is great though. Will be returning...
2.0,"Cute graphic but the shirt is sewn crooked so when you wear it, it automatically twists so the graphic is no longer in the center. Not worth returning. Wore once - not sure I'll wear again."
2.0,These are VERY SMALL.  Difficult to get on and immediately uncomfortable.  Returning asap!
2.0,Looks like an u finished shirt. I thought it would look fine but the loose ends look tacky.
2.0,This definitely could never be worn as a dress. I was a little upset because I purchased it for a photo shoot and on the day of I put it on and my whole behind was hanging out. I had to wear it as a shirt.
2.0,"I expected the sweater to be oversized and ordered a larger size, but it was snug and the color looked washed out, not as pictured.  Disappointed."
2.0,"There could have been a little more Velcro on the back strap to keep it from flapping, They don't stay tight on your foot because they didn't put enough velcro on so they come loose when you walk. Did better buying cheap ones at Walmart."
2.0,Came quick but I wish the package was in English all in Asian
2.0,I washed the shirt and it shrunk a size down. Now the doesn’t fit. The material Shriveled in the washing machine.
2.0,"Not sweat wicking, and stretches out as soon as you sweat, skull fades when you sweat..."
2.0,"First off, had a terrible time trying to remove the covering over the adhesive. Secondly, though the sweat band itself, worked as advertised, the fact of the matter is, it was no more than a 1""x 1' strip of self adhesive felt band, such as the felt strip you get with a roll of Velcro adhesive which you can purchase at a craft, home improvement, or auto parts store, at a fraction of the price."
2.0,"It didn't irritate my face, and it fit perfect until I washed it then it shrunk and now it's to small.. 😢"
2.0,"There was no option for size, but I would say it's about size S women's. It looks cute, but is very scratchy on the inside. It'd be tolerable if wearing a long sleeve underneath."
2.0,Got these for my little girl who was getting blisters on the monkey bars at school. She is age 7. They fit her OK but she says there’s a lot of wrinkling in them during her maneuvers on the bars. She also said they’re not very well gripped and I personally feel they are way too overpriced. They should not be more than seven dollars in my opinion  so $20 for a pair of gloves that don’t group well is an absolute rip off
2.0,Cute slippers but the inside shredded leaving pink fabric everywhere my daughter took her slippers off.
2.0,They are not socks so much as leg warmers or house slippers.  They are thick and loose - not suitable for wearing out.
2.0,Me gustan mucho pero no estan bien conturados se descosen aun cuando te los pones la primera vez!  Lo único que falta para que sean super!  Es una buena costura 😀
2.0,"I thought this was similar to the apple watch strap, but it is not. It has a plastic piece where the strap flips over. This causes the strap to not stay as tight as I need it to be."
2.0,"I wear a medium. Bought an xxl still too small, gave to my 9 yr old grand daughter"
2.0,"Doesn't look like photo....it's quite small and cheap quality, arrives jammed up in a tiny little box.  Definitely going back.  Not worth $29.99, looks like a $7.99 necklace from forever 21, or worse."
2.0,one of the stones around the eyes was missing...got a refund and reordered hope the second one will be intact...was one of Mom's mother's day gifts...she loves owls and this one is very pretty
2.0,I purchased according to the size chart. I usually wear a medium but bought a large. The top.is huge and the bottom fits. The material is cheap and not worth the money.
2.0,"I really want to like these and I do wear them about 1-2 times a week. However, for me, they are a pain in the butt walking in! Your heel slides back and makes them uncomfortable."
2.0,"5 year old loved the wallet, outer zipper broke on first use.<br />Get what you pay for and made in China."
2.0,Terrible fitting and hard to put on and tie up.
2.0,"This is so disappointed product, i never saw a biggggggg sleeves like that !!!!!! it need a gorilla to wear it"
2.0,Did not look the same in person. Returned
2.0,"The headbands themselves are lovely, however they are HUGE for a baby. Considering that they are listed for babies and were in the baby girl accessories department, I expected them to fit my 6 month old. These were so big that I could potentially wear them!!"
2.0,it was cheap looking to me
2.0,These boots are really cute but they are so cheaply made. Literally within 3 hours of wearing them both heels came unglued.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Looks cute but will fall apart.
2.0,I got a large and it’s more like a medium
2.0,"First, the band is functional and feels good.  It isn't fun installing any click bands on the Samsung Gear Fit 2.  They make it look so easy in the videos, but it's a chore, and you can't blame this band for that.  It is an interesting task seating the band correctly.  It seems like bands that click in want to seat in two different ways.  One way doesn't stay fastened all the way, and the other way fits just right.  You have to play with it.  As for the clasp that affixes the band to your wrist, it functions just as the original band does.  It seats fine, but as with the original, it can come loose.  That's what happens when you design a watch band with the same flawed characteristics as the original Samsung band.  No better, no worse, no matter what other reviewers are claiming with this aspect.<br /><br />Now for the bad, the color is all wrong.  The color is the main reason I bought this band.  If I wanted something simply functional, I would've stuck with the original black band that came with the Fit.  I bought the red version of this band and it looks nothing like the red in the picture.  I wanted Shiny Candy Corvette Red like shown, but what I got was more a dull matte orange/red (more orange than red).  Now you may be saying the color shown on a monitor might not represent the color as its supposed to look like in real life, and in a lot of cases that can be right, because some monitor color adjustments aren't setup correctly.  And that's why I had my monitor professionally calibrated.  I like to buy things online and demand getting what is pictured.  Since having this setup, I don't get surprised anymore.  Dropping some bucks to have this done is worth every penny.  I've only had one other company mis-represent their product's color since having this done.<br /><br />So I say buyer beware with the Kartice product, especially if you're planning on purchasing it in red.  And also buyer beware on other third party Samsung Gear Fit 2 bands that all seem to be using this same default picture as Kartice is, i.e. Elobeth and Aresh.<br /><br />So for fit and function this band gets a 3 stars, but because of the color disappointment it only gets 2 overall."
2.0,My initial review was very positive and favorable.  However within a week of wearing them  one earring tarnished and became discolored.  Now they are useless to me.  Disappointing!
2.0,I didn’t like the look of them when I saw them in person
2.0,My daughter is 2 and wears 2T-3T in clothing. These running small. She only wore once and after they were washed she couldn't fit into them again.
2.0,"A bit thin and the exact same shirt as: FPT Womens Basic Scoopneck Long Sleeve T-Shirt (S-3XL) which is 50 cents cheaper.  Brand is &#34;Active Basic&#34;.  Both sold on Amazon.  exact same shirt.  Vendors should say that in their descriptions, I think.  Fits me, 5'3&#34;, slim.  Pretty low scoop too."
2.0,"Looked nice when it arrived, but back starting to frub off/fray after only a few brief wearings. Wouldn't recommend it."
2.0,"(Update below original review)<br />Love this dress.<br />I'm 5'5, 195, 38DDD, ordered XL<br />I don't have any complaints.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I washed this dress once and it is covered in fuzz balls. I literally got 1 wear out of this dress and not it looks like trash. I'm so disappointed.  It's also too late for a refund.  The dress is great if you never wash it..."
2.0,"Received wallet today, nice wallet but...... it's made to carry on the left pocket..<br />So it's a bummer that the button on the wallet in now on  the inside of my pocket because I wear my wallets on right side...<br />If that makes any sense.."
2.0,The dress was a little small and too short
2.0,I specifically purchased these because the description said they had rubber soles. They don’t. They have the cheap foam non-marking soles that don’t hold up well.
2.0,runs a bit small.  and the material is not as nice as it looks in pic.  much more see through and thin.
2.0,I haven't lost it yet but the magnet is extremely weak. But it's cute
2.0,"Thick material is good for walking while it’s cold outside but very hot for summer. Not really designed for girls with big butts, hips and legs. High-rise in front, very low in the back. Also, high-rise in front turns to very low rise while walking. I just wasn’t comfortable walking in these. (I wear size 18 in women pants so I got the xl)."
2.0,"Good ish product, the images are quite deceptive, its literally just a blanket with a string and a pattern... the image made me believe it would be shaped like that or something... the materiap and quality is also not worth the message money even if you didnt care about the shape."
2.0,"I am 5’8” 127 pounds. I ordered the xsmall. The fit was awkward, snug in the best (I was not blessed in that region) and very large in the waist. It was also shorter than the photo shows. The material and tailoring were good though."
2.0,Hangs Too long
2.0,These earrings are heavy and I no longer own them.
2.0,"do not keep keep hands warm very well. used them to run snowblower, & fingers were real cold in 15 minutes while running blower, & they weren't wet either.  don't buy."
2.0,I loved these! They were the perfect but the clasp came undone easily and then it bent completely out of shape just trying to close! I was really sad when I lost one of the knives as I couldn't even put them on a new clasp.
2.0,Was so short my glasses broke putting them on.
2.0,"So I originally ordered the small... it fit perfect except for the length.... the length was no where near what you see on the model in the pictures. You could see my ankles and just above that on my leg! And I’m only 5’5”, models are usually very tall so I thought it would be longer.<br />Next was the medium order because I wanted the dress long. Disappointed when I open the dress and found a hole in it by the neck line. This is not a $22 dress, more like a $12 dress. If the price drops and you should purchase... the dress is soft and the color is exactly as shown, a very vibrant Kelly green."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. They work , lost them at a game.a week after purchasing."
2.0,"I can't figure out how to get a replacement, the item was some what small. I wore it for one day and the leg and back stickers were all peeling off. I was super excited for the product and paid 40$ for item. If someone could contact me back with how to get a replacement that would be great"
2.0,"Sleeve color looks like red and black plaid in the picture but is ORANGE and black plaid. Hate the sleeve color everything else is ok. If you like your tops a bit loose, go up a size."
2.0,"The swimsuit fit good. I'm 5'9 and 180 (mostly thighs) and ordered a large. The color was not the green as pictured. It was more forest green than army green which sucks because of my skin tone. Also, the stitching is not good. There are white parts sticking out that are obvious and should not show. If the stitching was better this would have been a great swimsuit."
2.0,In general we are happy with its fit - but the snap pulled through the thin fabric on the first try on.  I put a few stitches in and I think it will hold out for a short term- it is part of a Halloween costume so it won't have long term use.
2.0,"DOESN'T FIT LIKE MODEL, MATERIAL TOO LOOSE."
2.0,I ordered a large (Usually wear a size small).. and the arms were too short and it was a little too tight.  The arms are what really bothered me..
2.0,Way to long and big. Definitely size down it wasn’t very flattering either.
2.0,Muy incomodo para ponerse
2.0,These pants run very small
2.0,Ran much smaller than normal.  I have at least 20 Lauren dresses size 12 or 14 and this was much smaller.  Also has a very strange smell like men’s cologne or strange perfume.
2.0,"Husband likes it as a sweat guard for playing baseball, i dont like it because it is not microfiber and therefore not great for naturally curly hair."
2.0,I did not like the material or the fit.
2.0,"We like the price and the product works, but it is unraveling when washed which is not good. Each time it is washed, it is falling apart."
2.0,"I usually wear an XL in tops, this fits like a medium.  Cute cut and style etc but doesn't fit true to size."
2.0,"I've had this bag for less than 6 months and it's fraying and falling apart. I enjoyed all the compartments, but now it's barely functional."
2.0,Beautiful product but when I received this watch one of the pin was missing from the watch. The pin was in the package I didn't know and throw away the package so I had to get it fix.
2.0,"Quality is very poor, very thin not what I expected for sure not recommend"
2.0,I gave it 2 stars because the fabric is very thin and see through
2.0,Sizes run big
2.0,"Not very well put together. The gold tip fell off before I opened the package and the one horn wasn't glued on very well. Going to have to try and fix them before I use them. I was excited to find horns at a decent price, but, you get what you pay for."
2.0,the strings snapped after I wore it once... Not worth the money.
2.0,Way too big. Size down from actual size if you're looking to purchase these
2.0,"Do not purchase the gray bag if you've got your heart set on a gray bag. It's NOT gray. It's an ugly light brown. I purchased this bag as a Christmas gift for my brother and was so disappointed in the color. The bag itself is decent, but it doesn't look nice in person, the photos are deceiving."
2.0,"Ordered a US size 34, it said 34 in the waist however, it's really a 48. Wrong, just bad!"
2.0,They are great in that my students can see my mouth while saying/forming sounds.  Horrible in that they hold the humidity in.
2.0,They are out of plus sized options. This is unfortunate because that wouldve been more preferable. I am 5'8 and though I'm not large I have very wide hips and a long torso. I cannot wear the one size as a jumpsuit comfortably. Too tight on my muscular calves and not as loose around my body as I'd like. I am giving this 3 stars because it claims one size is sizes 0-12 but it's more like 0-8 or 0-10. Disappointed<br /><br />Update---- dropping ANOTHER star.  After hand washing (following the given instructions) and air drying it the fabric  has shrunk and feels stiff.  I tried to use my expensive washer and dryer as well washing on the gentlest of settings and drying it on my delicates rack and the fabric still feels awful. Im super upset. I DO NOT RECOMMEND
2.0,Got these shoes 6 days ago and one charger already stop working. Have a disappointed 8 yrs old.
2.0,They look nice but the metal wasn’t long enough to fit through both holes. I ended up giving them away to someone with only 1 hole as they made it look like she had tow holes since the metal stopped at her ear. Disappointing.
2.0,Have only had this bracelet a short time but I am very disappointed as it already looks to be tarnishing.
2.0,My daughter asked for a pair of these for Christmas and I knew they wouldn’t be top quality for the price. I didn’t however expect them to be made as cheaply as they are. They’re so cheap the top two buckles weren’t made long enough to use while wearing the boots. Definitely a disappointment and won’t be purchasing anything else from this company.
2.0,Ring is beautiful.. unfortunately it faded.. so it not Gold filled.<br />I have alot of gold filled jewelry<br />That have not faded or tarnished.
2.0,"Jewel was pretty. Bar was too long, and blunt."
2.0,Was really excited to receive this dress but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. The material is thick but it is very itchy. I thought it would be a little softer. It is a jersey type material. I ordered the medium because I did not want it to be super form fitting but I probably could have gone with my normal size small.
2.0,"While it is VERY pretty, there were a lot of loose threads that I had to trim off with embroidery scissors and it was folded over and wrinkled so that I had to iron it out so it would lay flat.  I wouldn't buy a product made of this type of material again."
2.0,This was a nice dress but it was hard to get into since it had no zipper. I couldn't get it on which was so disappointing. I brought a size medium which is my size
2.0,I wanted to like these but they were too narrow for my face
2.0,Very heavy. The first issue is that I ordered two different sizes to check fit. One came in a fancy bag with NO label sewn into the coat or hang tags. I wouldnt have know what size it was if I hadn't had the other next to it. The 2nd coat came without a fancy bag but had a real label with company name and size. What the heck? I understand some are returns but how can they send a coat with no label??? Photo attached of both. I ended up returning because the pleating around the waist made me look much bigger than I am. This style is for women who are rail thin eith no waist.
2.0,"At first glance this looked like a cute dress . But the material was thick and the seam under the bust was very very tight . The polka dots did not line up where the seams were and that made the dress look silly and cheap . It might have been cute in a solid color , if it was sized properly."
2.0,"I'm very disappointed in the yellow/navy one. I ordered the black/white one I guess from different seller but identical and loved it so much. The body had a tshirt feel to it while the sleeves were stretchy and silky almost. Their yellow one appeared to be black not navy so i went with this one where question was asked if it was navy or black and confirmed navy. Like another reviewer stated it is really clingy and i even went up to a large and i'm a medium. No matter what cami or bra i tried on with it the cups to bras still stuck out. Looking at it, its beautiful and EERS colors....but on it looked so tacky on me and short! I compared tags to my black white one that i love and they are not the same. Tag on black white one from another seller is meaveor this one is Merokeety. Returning. I so wished this fit and looked like my other one."
2.0,I liked and enjoyed the rings until they snapped. The rings snapped after using only five times. Very disappointed with this product.
2.0,"It's very beautiful, but the band around the chest that keeps the dress up, is itchy and uncomfortable. Not soft at all where it keeps the dress up so I honestly really never have worn it"
2.0,"Shirt is cute, but I ordered the red and it is NOT red. It is a deep pink. It will be going back. Also, I would definitely recommend ordering a size up."
2.0,Did not help my vision.
2.0,The quality is not as good as it appears in the photo; looks very cheap in person.
2.0,"I ordered an XL and they sent me an XXL. Annoying considering this was already my second time ordering this dress, because when I ordered a Medium the first time (my usual size) it was TINY. So after reading some reviews, I went up 2 sizes and ordered again and they sent me one size larger than what I ordered. I'm really irritated that I now have to go to a seamstress to get the waist taken in so I can wear this dress. I am already out the $9 from the first order that went to waste, so I am not ordering for a third time. If it was an honest mistake, it happens I suppose. If they sent the XXL because they were out of XL, then that's not cool. I put a lot of thought to the size I would need to work for my body through trial and error and reading through reviews. Accuracy, people."
2.0,Great quality but fit smaller than expected
2.0,"Super thin, nice cut, but not for people that sweats a lot, thinner than a polyester Tshirt"
2.0,"Fits as expected and easy to wear for any occasion, but had to return it because one sleep was bigger than the other."
2.0,I bought the necklace that goes with this bracelet and I wear that all the time. Have never worn this as the ring looks like it came from the dollar store.
2.0,I like the material...but product doesn't fit very well and it's very difficult to get cards in and out.
2.0,"Unfortunately, this cap is made poorly.  There are string coming out of the hat.  Overall, I am disappointed with the size and quality."
2.0,Pretty cheap looking bag.
2.0,I had ordered three pairs for me in three different colors. I received two that were late but one on time. I am returning all because they sent them all three the same color. Also because they were too bigThey were also too long.
2.0,Had to order it three times to get the right one! Ones  I got the right one it was awesome but did have to send it back twice
2.0,Very aesthetically beautiful but bend very easily would not encourage to buy.
2.0,The top zipper is difficult to close to the end
2.0,Uncomfortable. Rubbed on feet. Almost felt like they were made of plastic. Sent them right back
2.0,"This product should be worth much less since it’s quality is very low. Total rip off considering the price, I would recommend buying a different selection."
2.0,"Too tight across the bust. Nice leather. The jacket fit beautifully across the shoulders, great sleeve length, and nicely shaped - until I zipped it up. Way too tight across the bust. And I’m not large chested. Soooo disappointed."
2.0,Very difficult to figure out how to use it. However my granddaughter felt it would be useful.
2.0,"Second time I wore these, I pulled off the earring back and the rhinestone came out!"
2.0,The earrings looked bigger online.
2.0,Product does not curl when using a curling iron
2.0,"I am a Betsey Johnson fan and have some of her jewelry and another purse.  This particular bag is gorgeous, but only lasted less than a month before it started to unravel.  There is no way to fix it.  I took it to a seamstress and she could not find a way to repair the flowers that were coming apart.  Not happy with the quality."
2.0,"Loved the style, but couldn't believe how dysproportionate the cups were. There was no chance in wearing it."
2.0,Sadly this came with a big Z on the front of it which was not in the photos before purchasing. Cheap costume hat but works for Halloween
2.0,I'm gonna buy one of the other styles I love the ones I got update these things aren't made very sturdy they ripped extremely easy after wearing them once or twice  loved them at first sad
2.0,"This pair was not the same as the slim, flexible nicely lined pair I had years ago. I bought these because description said they would resist water, be warm and flexible, and would work on touch screens.  Well, when they get wet, my hands get wet. And then they get cold. I usually have to put the gloves on the floor of the car in the heat path so they're warm when I get to work. I can't use my keys to lock my door in the morning - they're too clumsy. Touch screen function?  About 50% of the time I can change a station on my touch screen car radio.  I only paid around $11, but the package said $40. Oh no way!"
2.0,"Loved the product, the sizing is off from what is offered. I would size up."
2.0,"Let me start by saying I am five foot one, with the hips of a woman who has six kids. So I was looking for something that would keep all that to a minimum lol<br />It was badly wrinkled in the package and I had to steam it before ironing it. No big deal. Material is thick, sturdy with some stretch. Sleeves were a tad too long, but again, no big deal. The skirt hits me an inch or so below my knee, and is very full without a crinoline beneath it...very vintage looking. The issue came when I washed it (on gentle) to rid it of that slight chemical smell that new clothes have. Two inches of the seam right below my waist line came unstitched. The collar wrinkled so bad I cannot iron it out. The lace is unraveling and has strings hanging all over the place. I fixed everything but the collar, and wore it a two more times. I was afraid to wash it, but my toddler wiped her face on the skirt at a funeral and I had to. More seams came undone. There are three separate seams that need fixing now. The lace is not holding up well. I am not pleased with the workmanship on this dress, and find that it is over priced for the quality.<br />However, it is a beautiful dress. I was complemented numerous times all three times I wore it and everyone wanted to know where I had found such a gorgeous dress. It was comfortable to wear, no itchy or scratchy issues with the lace. I could be tempted to buy this again, if the price were closer to $20 than $45, as I figure I'd probably have to resew most of the seams. Otherwise, I'd just try another brand. I just don't see the point in spending a ton of money on anything that constantly needs to be fixed because of poor workmanship.<br />UPDATE:<br />I fixed the seams and wore it to church, where my husband pointed out a huge hole in the armpit. Once home, I examined the hole and discovered that whoever sewed that particular part of the dress missed the fabric. There is a two inch bunch of stitches that hangs off the dress by the hole. I'm taking a star away for deplorable workmanship, and will NOT be buying this brand again, regardless of price."
2.0,Note cute at all
2.0,"Good material, but was somewhat tight fit. The biggest issue was the color - the yellow shown is no where close to the pic by the seller - take a look at the pic I uploaded...so had to return..."
2.0,"These shoes look nice but have horrible chemical smell. I don't even know if I'll use them because I'm worried about chemical exposure for my little one. I think they fit true to size. My daughter is 14 months old and wears a 5 for other shoes. I got 5.5 so they would fit all summer into fall and at least had to try them on her. They are a little big on her right now but just as I wanted. If it wasn't for the smell, I'd be very happy with them. I wish I would have read the reviews before ordering."
2.0,"Ordered an XL thinking it was a US size, and the size is more of an US size XS or Small.  At largest, possibly a medium.  I can fit into a medium though, and this... Doesn't fit.<br /><br />I am 5'8 and 160 lbs.  Size 30 in waist, and 36C chest.  It's length is short, to my knees instead of ankles.<br />The arms are very thin.  Also this came completely unbuttoned, with no tags on it (at all) to show size.  Looks to be rush made with hanging threads all over and knotted stitching like the sewing machine got caught.<br /><br />Thought I would take a chance ordering this and find out since it had no reviews.  Going to return it since it was prime."
2.0,"The fit was not as expected. I didn't mind the top, but it did run a little small. The bottoms were really small for me, so I just couldn't wear it."
2.0,I love the material but not style. It looks like old fashion.
2.0,Shipped in a bag that looked like it either got stuck in machinery or ran over.  Ties are of decent quality but need some threads to be trimmed.
2.0,Ordered two pairs and both had holes in them.
2.0,My granddaughter love them. The price was a little to expensive considering the fact the they are very cheaply made.
2.0,"Cheaply made. Tarnished quickly. Chains broke. Kind of a waste, but my daughter loved the characters."
2.0,"Pretty jacket, but too small."
2.0,"Light weight fabric, tee shirt like. The print is just like the photo. I wish it came in a larger size, and that the hem line was 4- 6 inches longer. Other than that It's a nice summer dress."
2.0,Cheaply made broken straps
2.0,"First, as someone who does not wear any plugs ever, these are comfortable to wear. I hardly notice having them in throughout the day. In the photo they are pictured as a beautiful light purple clearly seeing the etched flower. The pair I received today, was definitely not as imagined. As with stone I am aware not all of it looks the same. Im more disappointed that I finally chose to change my style and the pair I got did not meet my expectations. The stone is a dark purple, with harsh white lines; making the flower not noticeable."
2.0,material looks different than the picture but it’s still cute. not durable though. already fraying at edges after one wash
2.0,"They look much nicer in the picture. I realize that they are faux leather but they look cheap once out if the box. Also, the ankle is thick which for wearing with pants wouldn't be a problem but they are not good for anything other than pants. They are getting returned. But I will say that if you're not looking for an upscale faux leather boot, aesthetically they are nice and fit well."
2.0,"As much as I like this watch, I am going to have to return it because the clasp does not close tight enough.  It has fallen off of my arm three times - on to the floor.  Lucky that the crystal didn't break.  I have made sure that it has been snapped tightly."
2.0,It is very nice but it is actually bigger than what it sized.
2.0,"Socks slide, otherwise they are OK"
2.0,Just get those temp tattooes instead.
2.0,I love these and they are lightweight. But they turn my skin colors. I had a brown/green substance around my ear piercing when I took them out.
2.0,"Too tight.  Just too tight.  It definitely is not 9 inches as described.  It's beautiful, but that's useless, if it can't be worn comfortably."
2.0,"I bought this and returned it, it doesn't provide enough coverage for bigger busted women nor does it have good support."
2.0,It fits but is a bit scratchy feeling.
2.0,Returned it because I couldn't get the odor out of it....some kind of chemical odor from the material.
2.0,Loved the design and color However I used purse for 2 days and zipper tab came off.
2.0,These are way too big for the watch they claim to be for.
2.0,They are the correct toys. They arrived dirty and the packaging torn and damaged. I have to clean both up and remove the backing board and put them together to make them look nice for Christmas. A bit disappointed by that since this was sold as new.
2.0,"I confused the product title of 2028 with one of my favorite manufactures 1928. Since I didn't read clearly enough (which surely the seller/manufacture was counting on) my expectation were of a quality piece which I was used to with the company 1928. To say it did not meet my expectations was an understatement. The photo makes the bracelet looks much more substantial than it is. It is thin and flimsy. It bent when resting my wrist on the table. The mother of pearl cabochons looks like plastic. The manufacture has the width of the bracelet listed in the ad, but not the length. It fit, but was not a bracelet fit. If you look at the photo, that piece that's visable - there are only 2 of them. I've never worn this piece past trying it on when it bent. I had such excitement over receiving this piece, that my let down was disheartening. I would only recommend this to add to your children's dress up clothes."
2.0,"I was excited for this dress to arrive, but when it finally did I was highly disappointed. First off, you would need to stretch out the neckline in order to get the &#34;off shoulder&#34; look, the cut of the dress is nothing like the picture, It looks more like a very large shirt/ moo moo with 2 long slits on the sides. Not recommended for curvy girls, will probably just use it as a pajama shirt."
2.0,"They arrived and were very light Weight,like fragile"
2.0,"I bought three pairs of these because they are so comfy. I loved these shoes but the sole which is like rubbery, starts to come apart and every step you take the sole snaps and hits the bottom of the shoe making a loud noise and makes them embarrasing. I wish they were made better."
2.0,"Beautiful, but way too small, had to give away."
2.0,I consider myself an average build but these jean's are funky. They git at the waist but the hips are super wide.
2.0,we used on a 2 week European vacation for a family of 4.  I like the RFID Blocking feature but found it to be too big and bulky and 4 passports didn't fit too comfortably with other items.
2.0,"Safety release is not durable and broke. It lasted a few months, so I’m wondering if I got my $8 worth?"
2.0,"These are super cute, but they blistered my daughters feet with just a few hours of wear. We had to get bandaids while we were out. Hard lesson for a 6 year old."
2.0,"The neck line, for me, was a deal breaker. It was huge and wrinkly. It wouldnt sit flat and looked like an old wrinkly shirt. Maybe my sizing was too big, but I'm returning these and will try another brand."
2.0,"I bought one of these about 10 years ago for my macbook. It was fantastic, lots of protection and laid out well.<br /><br />I bought this one for my new macbook. There's almost no protection and the padding that's in it doesn't even run the full length of the laptop. It's too big for the 13"" macbook pro. It wiggles around inside. My previous one was nice and snug but not too tight. It was perfect, this new one sucks."
2.0,There are no directions on how to use this
2.0,These are quite large.  If you have medium to small nose pads these are huge..  I would recommend verifying the size.
2.0,"I like it and babies looks super cute wearing this, but To be honest the quality is so Poor the bun comes off in the first washed"
2.0,"I bought a few different wallets with this one.  They all claimed to be slim, and they all truly failed at that.  I was looking for a wallet just big enough to fit a few cards, ID, and cash into, but no bigger.  This one, just like the others, were way too big and some cards even fit loosely which caused concern."
2.0,I wear a women's US 7.5 narrow. These socks are way too small. It's too bad because they look nice.
2.0,Sheds badly -- leaves red clumps wherever I walk
2.0,Broke after only wearing one time
2.0,nice dress but their sizing is way off.....I would like this dress if it were 3 or 4 sizes bigger.
2.0,"wayyyyyyyyyyy too small, I gave it to my daughter. not really as pictured but not too far off either. shipping was good, came before expected delivery date."
2.0,These looked more on the gold side of rose gold than the bright pink that's pictured.  Otherwise shape and structure is cute.
2.0,"Would look great on slimmer, taller women."
2.0,I ordered an XL and I am a Medium and it's still too small. Cheaply made.
2.0,So I’ve had this sitting for a while because I’m obsessed with it and I ordered a large because I read all the reviews and I was like OK large. It is massive like I would think it was it 2 XL. Also it is not least it feels really cheap
2.0,Didn't fit great finger were cold :(
2.0,I like the band but it's already turning silver
2.0,"This was my first purchase from ZAN.STYLE.  I was hoping these dresses, which I bought in Off-White and in Green, were just like [[ASIN:B072WPRTW3 Milumia Women's Button Up Split Floral Print Flowy Party Maxi Dress X-Large Black-Green]].  However, while they appear very similar on-screen, they are just not as nice as Milumia's.  I purchased the same size - XL.  While wearable, these were a bit smaller all around and the material is polyester.  Not that I'm a &#34;polyester snob&#34;, but this particular poly just doesn't feel comfortable on my skin. Maybe laundering would make it softer.  Also, the buttons are larger and much more noticable, but not in a good way.  One good point: the buttons only loop as far as the bodice, not all the way down, so less chance of a wardrobe malfunction.  However, there is no &#34;spacer&#34; material between the buttons and the loops, so seeing some skin there may not  appeal to some wearers.  The Milumia dress does have a strip of matching dress material there and I prefer that.  Over all, while the ZAN.STYLE dresses are basically okay and are cheaper than Milumia, you get what you pay for.  Back they go."
2.0,"Glasses are very cheap and look cheap when you wear them. If you do decide to try it out, get them in black."
2.0,Broke on the second day.
2.0,Material is good but I need a large and not S/M
2.0,"These gloves are very small, especially if a man is playing Santa.  The hat is also small and short in length.  The ball pokes off the top of the head as the red material is stretchy.  It looks ridiculous. I don't like the shape of the glasses either it's more Harry Potter than Santa."
2.0,"Cheap material , weird fit!"
2.0,"This &#34;unisex&#34; scarf does not look to me like the one depicted on this site.  The black and white pattern is larger than&#34;hounds tooth&#34; seen on the site. The material didn't feel particularly warm.  Opened the package, felt it,  sealed it and sent it back.  Reviewers seem to like it.  Will pass on any recommendation."
2.0,Gave it 2 stars cuz it looks great but I ordered a 2xl for my sister who wears xl and its too small. Im homebound so returning its really a option. Just beware its not US sizing.
2.0,"These glasses are really cheap in price and quality. The vendor shipped really quickly so I can't really blame them for me being a cheapskate, but I'd recommend others to spend a bit more for a similar product."
2.0,"These ran too small and the stripes were glittery, which I didn't note in the pictures or description."
2.0,"When I walk into Sole Laundry (227 Wight st se) the first thing owner Nichole Verdejo looks at is my sneakers, assessing them for a cleaning. They’re yellowing, so she takes me to the back to show me the oxidizer, which will, to use a term from sneaker culture “ice” them back to pristine white.<br /><br />Verdejo is the first woman to own and operate a sneaker laundry in the country—maybe the world. Sole Co cleans and restores sneakers<br /><br />We purchased these shoes may 23 for use at camp. My 6-yo daughter started wearing them when camp began june 28.<br /><br />On July 22 3 weeks, 3 days later, and with 2 days left in my daughter’s 4-week summer camp, she tried to pull them on and they separated —upper pulled away from the sole.<br /><br />We were otherwise so happy with them that during camp four of her friends bought the exact same shoe. I dread finding out the day this happens to them —theirs are a week newer.<br /><br /> Before I post a review of this item publicly I gave the seller a chance to replace them so my 6-year-old has sandals for the rest of the summer. I heard nothing."
2.0,Material not to my liking. Returned
2.0,Doesn’t matter how tight we get it water still gets in.
2.0,"Looks good visually. Quality not as great, feels cheap on my skin. Probably wouldn't have bought it if I knew."
2.0,"All I received was the cape and hat.  It all was very misleading.  The cape and hat are nice, but am very disappointed that it did not come with all that was promised."
2.0,If you have size 11-12 in women’s then I would definitely buy these . i’m a huge fan of superheroes. I will definitely buy the shoes I really really want these
2.0,"This hat runs extremely small!  Bought the 6-18 month size for my 12-month granddaughter and it doesn't even cover her head.  Exchanging it for the 2-3 year size, which hopefully will fit her.  (Otherwise, it seems like it will be a nice, warm, soft hat.)"
2.0,Loved the design of these. Definitely order up on sizing. I got a Med. Tiny Tiny waist on these.
2.0,"The size was way too small. The sizing chart shows inches and size, so selling it in centimeters is useless. I have to send the hat back on my dime and order 2 sizes larger, going by what I received. Not happy."
2.0,It's little too big. But okay.
2.0,"Es un gran sombrero, proteje muy bien del sol y la tela es de muy buena calidad pero es una lástima que sus herrajes se oxiden."
2.0,I really liked everything about this jacket except that it was at least 2 sizes too small! I ordered an xxl which is what I normally wear and couldn’t come close to zipping. My wife who is 1-2 sizes smaller than I tried on and couldn’t zip up. When I went to order larger size a different jacket popped up.
2.0,Don't buy! Very bulky hardware. It can't keep a charge. It's very difficult to charge.  All of the audio components of this are very disappointing. I'm giving 2 stars instead of one because the actual hat is okay.
2.0,The color of the blue beads within the necklace itself are very bright blue -- and not a good bright blue.  Very odd.
2.0,They are piling already and my daughter has used them once. They are cute but I wouldn't get more.
2.0,This dress was not attractive at all once I received it.
2.0,I received the suspenders and one of the clamps was broken. I was going to return them but we put our own button on them and they worked great and my daughter loves them. They are cheaply made but they work and I didn’t pay much for them.
2.0,"Overall ok fit but not supportive enough to be a sports bra for any intense workout. Comfy enough for around the house lounging, or housework, but I'd be afraid that I'd knock myself out if I tried going for a run."
2.0,They look great but they have this really funky smell to them.
2.0,"It came within the expected timeframe. The rhinestone is very pretty and reflects light well. BUT, it came with a broken finger strap that is so damaged it cannot be fixed. I would have to take it to a specialty shop to have the band replaced. Came from overseas so cannot be returned. The most upsetting part is that it had to be damaged before it was shipped because it was inside a sealed plastic pouch, wrapped heavily in bubble wrap, and placed inside a padded envelope. The seller shipped it broken! Will not use this seller again - cannot be trusted."
2.0,"These are great, really adorable, but we only received half of the bell pair. We aren't going to return them as my daughter had already opened one of the other pairs and put them on before I told her the problem. So disappointed"
2.0,And the metal bling kept coming undone. Love the fabric. Had to return it due to being too big.
2.0,"Didn’t like it since it looked pretty cheap and fake, so I returned it"
2.0,Really thin material and way too small for an adult. Very uncomfortable.
2.0,"I had high hopes for festive fall fun involving these pants, all of which were dashed.  These are not leggings that I would ever really wear anywhere. For starters, they’re a super shiny synthetic fabric, with print on top. When you stretch out the fabric, the pictures come apart with lines in between.<br />The size I ordered was way too large so they look like oddly shaped, shiny, bizarre pressed trousers on me.<br />Not a fan. These are not a good purchase."
2.0,one size don't fit all gave to a friend
2.0,"Fabric quite thick, horrid big band at the bottom not shown in pictures makes it much more like a sweatshirt than a 'top'"
2.0,"I see other buyers have complained about the nose piece being too small.  I have a slender nose sits off of the nose on my TRo5 Torege sunglasses which are similar to the TR002 model.  I took them to a resatuarnt, and they didn't fit any adult nose in the place, and we tried 11 noses.  The rest of the product would be great if only they fit grown adults."
2.0,"bought this for my husband, and within 24 hours the beads started breaking and falling off. It was definitely a lesson learned, and next time we will spend more money when looking for bracelets!"
2.0,You can see where the crystals are glued in. They aren't set in the ring as expected. I wear it on my thumb. I had to coat it in clear nail polish because it does turn me green.
2.0,It feels good like good quality but the gold color is too yellow.
2.0,The dress is not made well. The hemline is unrevealing and the material is not working for me.
2.0,"Pretty colors, but described as a women's tunic. This is clearly a large man's shirt. I am returning this shirt."
2.0,Based on the model image I expected this sweater to fit different. It's really thick and doesn't really flow.
2.0,Not wash and wear need different material
2.0,"I measured my child's foot and it fell within range of size 11, but when we received it, it was way too big. At least 1-2 sizes too big, which means it was about 1-1.5 inches bigger than what we needed. You will need to size down."
2.0,The quality was not as good as I expected.  The tail kept coming off too easily and eventually fell apart before I could make it through a week at camp.
2.0,It's too top Heavy. So it's uncomfortable.
2.0,"Very disappointed.  This are NOT velvet, and are labeled &#34;trouser socks&#34; -- quite thin.  They barely go over the knees either and need pulling up frequently."
2.0,"the dress does not fit like the picture at all, due to the liner, the dress keeps bulging in all the weird places and wont stay down, I personality did not like how it looked on me so I returned it."
2.0,"I wanted something loose, but these are much bigger than expected."
2.0,"There were nice boxes, but some of them were not usable. The white backing inside the box had come unglued and there was so easy way to fix it."
2.0,"Loved it. Cute, my niece loved it, but just fits too small. My niece just turned 3 and is thin. But unfortunately she will only wear it a couple of times. And I made sure to order a size up. But still fits too small... so maybe order 2 sizes up."
2.0,"product looks great, feels great but doesn't stay up so they are worthless to me"
2.0,The color is close to the picture but it is not the same shape at all. The picture looks like a nice a-line bob but the wig I got is more like a mullet with face framing layers all the way down and the back had strange longer pieces. You can also see through the blue hair to the netting if you move your head at all. Sending back.
2.0,"I normally wear a small but I ordered this for my son's teacher who looks more Medium. I ordered a large to be safe. I tried it on upon arrival and although the length of the garment and front closure was accurate with a large, the back was tight when I extended my arms forward. I have a small frame so I doubt she will be able to fit it. Sad because it's so pretty. There weren't any tags so I'm assuming each one is made differently. Maybe it's a hit or miss. Mine was a miss."
2.0,"I suppose this towel will be okay in the summer or at the pool? Definitely doesn't absorb any water on your body. I got out of the shower and put it on and the water just transfered back and forth from the towel to my skin making me super cold. The sizing is correct. I'm 5'4"" 190 and got a large. Definitely could do a medium."
2.0,The necklace is very cute but the color changes quickly after a few days and leaves a line around your neck
2.0,"It’s Not True To Your Size.<br /><br />I am a medium and I ordered an extra large just to be sure and the extra large was still too tight, I would recommend that you order based on what I’m telling you. The material is good very sunny the craftsmanship is great however it’s polyester and polyester doesn’t stretch."
2.0,I was not happy they are to small cheaply made
2.0,I brought it to gift and ended up being almost ridiculously big and too reflective from the inside to actually be useful. I’m disappointed for sure.
2.0,it's way too small
2.0,I bought these bonnets for my teenage daughter and I to wear on a pioneer trek.  They are too small for both of our heads and they sent us matching bonnets. They claimed to come in a variety. Notice they are not returnable.  Disappointing!
2.0,"I was hopeful after reading the reviews that this would be a comfy, casual top but when I tried it on, I was disappointed with the fit.  It was too puffy at the bottom and hit my thigh at the widest point.  Not flattering on my at all.  I am 5'6 and 140 pounds--carry weight in my hips and thighs.  I returned it."
2.0,"Fabric is great. Love the high waist. When I first opened, it felt like an expensive, quality legging. But the FIRST time I wore, the threads started to unravel in THREE locations. Because I wore and can’t return, I’ll have to pay to have these fixed if I want to wear them again. Might as well just buy the expensive leggings next time."
2.0,I got an XL and runs a little small it fits like perfectly and is not cropped I am 5’1 and it’s like a long shirt on me lol!
2.0,Very strange cut. The top is way to thick.
2.0,"Received merchandise as promised. But the boxers are somewhat small. Quite tight and short inseams. They remind me of basketball players' shorts in the 60s, 70s, etc."
2.0,"The XL fit smaller than an XS. Seriously, they looked like they were for a child. Probably why they don't have a size chart available. I do not recommend."
2.0,"Small, Chain broke after less than 24 hours use"
2.0,"The material was light and comfortable, but the fit was just off. It fit in the arms but the rest of the shirt was huge. Almost reminded me of those blow up costumes these days. All you would need is an air pump and you’d look like a marshmallow! Wouldn’t recommend. Ordered a medium."
2.0,"I'm 5'1 140 lbs and the medium dress was much lower cut than it was on the model.  I'd have to wear a tank top underneath it.  I should have probably gone a size up.  I still have a small tummy pooch thanks to my kiddo, and the medium was really tight in the stomach area.  I wanted this one to work, but had to return it."
2.0,Washed according to directions and found a run in them shortly after putting them in. Length is too long ( goes up to knee cap) and rolls down. Foot portion feels a little big.
2.0,Cheap. I never wear it.
2.0,"no too god, cause at the end of the night everything was gone"
2.0,"I usually wear a small or xsmall and I bought a small in this. I could’ve easily worn a large, it’s so small in the waist and allows no stretch. The fabric is very thin too."
2.0,Bit disappointed. The hat won’t loose it’s crease.
2.0,The leather? is so thin that the credit cards cut through the stitching and everything falls out of the wallet.
2.0,Too small and too difficult to clasp.
2.0,I like the design but the Skirt part of the outfit was too short for me well that and that is OK
2.0,I chose the wrong size.
2.0,"I received the hoodie and tried it on, it was very wide....and the sleeves felt like something was pulling on the inside, like there was no give...and the camo print was very juvenile, I thought. The sizing is OK, I would've liked the material to give a little more.......it just wasn't comfortable, I am returning."
2.0,I had these bands for less than 1 year and 3 of the bands are broken. Now I have to reorder bands again.
2.0,Its pretty but its basically a wallet that folds in half. The zipper goes over only half of the opening so it isn't actually functional if you care about your money falling out.
2.0,"I bought this for a great deal less than the currently advertised price, and it wasn't worth it then. Small, cheaply plated. Not worth $25, much less $99."
2.0,Stone fell out after a few minutes of wear.  Seemed to be glued in and poorly so.  Returned.
2.0,"The price was right, so I thought I'd try this strap. The faux leather is poor quality, very thin and feels like paper. Anywhere the band bends a small amount (e.g. the watch pins and buckle) the band changes color from stretching.<br /><br />I did appreciate that the band came with 4 new posts and a tool (but the tool snapped when I used it)."
2.0,Got item a day late !  item ok.
2.0,"Quality was good, however, I needed a 6ga to continue my stretching and that was the one size that did not come. Very disappointing."
2.0,"These were a nice style, but way too small"
2.0,These are what they are for the price. Cute style but the uv protection is not good.u our can see the lines through everything and it makes the focus not clear.
2.0,"Fine if it was just a regular bra, but not for nursing. The padded cups have a weird shape and awkward for nursing. Wire popped out after first use and had to throw away. Would not recommend."
2.0,material reminds me of craft felt... very cheaply made
2.0,It is how it looks but soooo cheap. Would have been ok if I hadn't spent so much on it. I highly doubt it will last more then one wear.
2.0,"I ordered a large. I'm 5' 7.5"". It's so short,  covers maybe half my butt. My fiance loves it. Material is soft but I'm unable to use it for my bridal pics because of how short it is."
2.0,material is fabulous but the dress just didn't fit.  I'm sending it back.
2.0,So small as to be uncomfortable when purchased in my usual size. Clasp was broken upon arrival so the straps simply dangle and had to be cut off. Nice leather though.
2.0,"Beautiful top, but the skirt was horrible, cheap and flimsy.  I returned it."
2.0,When I received it I was surprised to find out that it was very THICK and that the face of the watch was enlarged by the thick glass to make the music inside look really large...wasn't at all what I was expecting.
2.0,"This watch, unfortunately was not of sufficient quality to last more than 8 hours. The watch lost time almost immediately, even though I would wind it and reset it every 2 hours... I think. It could be a fluke but I am not patient enough to get another of the same watch."
2.0,The sides are misleading my son is a 32-34 he needs a 38
2.0,"Very pretty dress but unfortunately I had to return because the mid section does not hug your body like the picture. If you have a similar body to the model, large bust and hips and small waist, this dress will not sit well on you."
2.0,"I was not impressed with this jacket. It arrived crumbled up and looking like a hobo slept in it. I tried ironing it out, but too much ironing makes this material very shiny and even cheaper looking. Even if I get it pressed to remove the wrinkles, the fit is all wrong. The shoulders are too padded and the sleeves are too long. The length of the jacket is correct as is the fit around my waist so I can't go a size down either.<br />The material is not one that I'd bother sending to a tailor to shorten the wrists. I'm not a fan."
2.0,"Looks and feels cheap, but then again for the price it is OK"
2.0,You will wait 3 weeks after you order to receive these glasses and the picture shown is of Gold glasses but they are actually black when you get them. Dont make same mistake I did if you are getting these to use a prescription.
2.0,5'2 114 pounds the small was a little too big in the arms and around the neck. Recommend they make an xs size. Material is comfortable. The open back makes it  tacky for a classy look. Good if you are going for that lok though.
2.0,"This dress is only lined on the bodice. The rest is semi-transparent. I am 5’7”, and the dress doesn’t go as long as it looks in the photo. Additionally, the front is super low cut. The pic shows a moderate amount of chest shown, it cuts to the middle of my boobs"
2.0,"Runs Very Small  wear a 9 , ordered XL  STILL TOO SHORT"
2.0,Ordered a medium for a loose fit.  There is elastic around bottom of shorts that make shorts tighter and more fitted.  Not a fit i like for pajamas.
2.0,I only received 8 pcs in the bag. Title description said 10 pcs.
2.0,Actual size did not match description / size chart
2.0,"Do not waste your money. Wish I had checked the reviews. One lady said it scared her cats, that's about the only thing it would scare. Sounds like a far away car alarm.<br />Shame on Amazon for selling."
2.0,"Broke too fast, in about a month"
2.0,it broke 5 days after i bought it. horrible quality
2.0,Material Is hard like doesnt fall nice like it should in the pictures Is not long either... Súper wide but short not liking it!
2.0,"One size so incorrect, love the pattern but it runs very small"
2.0,It's cute but my baby is now 4 months and this still doesn't fit
2.0,Washed before wearing and the clip in the middle broke off. Didn’t ever even get a chance to use it.
2.0,"Shirt fits my 6 month old son, pants are long enough to fit his dad!!"
2.0,Didn't do much for me and my built already three days and it's already stretched out. Maybe it'll help if your smaller and trying to shape yourself out.
2.0,This was not what I expected which may be my own fault.  The tote came completely wrinkled and it’s made of a canvas type material.  The “pleather” is very cheap looking (in my opinion).  I returned it.  I think I can do better especially for the money!
2.0,The sizes thin really small
2.0,"It says plus size but there were small, medium and large size options listed as well so I ordered a large which was too big and then a medium, also too big. I might try a small or I might just give up and move on. I haven't decided yet. Otherwise item exactly as listed."
2.0,"I bought these for my running shoes for when I race, and was very excited, but they just don't work.  On a regular running shoe they sit very close in the middle and bunch at the end.  I have a small foot, size 5.5, so maybe on a bigger foot it would work better, but they just lay weird.  I think on a high top, where they can stand out they would be super cute, but not for me."
2.0,"The hook was very bad, wore it once and it torned apart"
2.0,The material not wh t'ai expected
2.0,these are not hypoallergenic earrings because I have allergies  and my ears got infected with these earrings u might want to make people aware of this problem before buying them
2.0,"I got this yesterday for Christmas, & I was upset that the little ball u have to pop in & out to adjust the time kept on falling out. I had to fix it by super gluing it. Poorly made :("
2.0,"The pockets on this make your hips look HUGE, unless you’re really tiny this isn’t that flattering"
2.0,"Cute dress,  strange material.  The material is very cheap and I have a hole in it I have to sew already.  However,  it is still a very cute dress and the colors are very vibrant and the style and shape are cute.  I wish I could give 2 1/2 stars."
2.0,cute glasses - but produce blurry vision
2.0,Extremely baggy compared with other shorts
2.0,"Some of the vinyl was loose in several places.  The design may allow for that, without being too noticeable.  I was disappointed because it’s such a cute design."
2.0,The underarms got balls of lint going down the side. Not very good material. Only put it on twice.
2.0,Over priced and not a good choice for my teenager.
2.0,Touch screen ability was lacking for the most part definitely not -30 and not water proof
2.0,The strap broke after 1 month. Very beautiful and classy but alas...
2.0,Cheap materials and look. But what you should expect for the price.
2.0,"Looked great however, the material was flimsy.  Son said it felt &#34;weird&#34; when wearing it - no support."
2.0,Tarnishes after 3 weeks of wear.
2.0,Kind of disappointed I had one before and it did glow this one is not glowing given one I said it by the window where the sun is shining and pull it away see it in the dark.
2.0,"Color and material is great, just a little on the long side, I’m 5,3 and a large came past my hips."
2.0,"Cons<br />The dress is cheaply made. It arrived with loose beads and undone stitching. The fabric looks and feels cheap. It looks like it can only stand up to one wear. I hope it stays together for my holiday party.<br /><br />Pro<br />The fit is great though, I am 5' 2"" and 170lbs and I bought a medium and it hugs my curves."
2.0,"Very cheaply made with strings hanging out. Very faded colors, not like pictured."
2.0,"fit was accurate, however the quality was not. stitching was a bit crooked, shirt was very then and not even close to the color pictured. it was more of a light peach color."
2.0,Looks fine. Too small though.
2.0,"I like that the size is correct and is long for a slim girl. However, it is so thin, and see through"
2.0,"Beautiful bag that has held up well!  Very pleased!<br /><br />I just had to edit my previous review.  After using this bag only about 5 times, the handle broke."
2.0,Fell apart pretty quickly after wearing once.
2.0,Needs to be careful while selecting the size. My shoe size is 10.5 (US) and ordered 9-10 size of htis product expecting it to be a little tight. But it came out too big to a level that it easily comes off while walking.<br />The material seems to be good and comfy. I'm returning it and mostly going for a smaller size.
2.0,"The watch functions fine but, good Lord—this thing's tiny. It's like a toy watch or something appropriate for a child. The face is too small to read the time with my middle-aged eyes. At less than $12, it's not worth returning; I'll find a use for it or give it to someone who can make use of it. Meantime, it's back to the drawing board for me, albeit wiser. Once again I'm reminded you get what you pay for: tiny price = tiny watch (lol)."
2.0,It’s tight through the middle.
2.0,I liked the design of this and was disappointed to find out it is plastic.
2.0,The top was way too small and had no support
2.0,This is the second time I have tried these bands.The first broke and only lasted about 6 months.And this one is heading down the same path
2.0,Definitely does not support 38DD for running.  Creates an instant uni-boob and lifts so high that everything just spills out the top within a few steps.
2.0,Very loose in stomach
2.0,Cheap. Both arrived unglued from their base. Still semi-functional.
2.0,"These are wide and large, look and fit my daughter like clown shoes!"
2.0,"One screw that held an arm on broke off after my second use. This happened when I was lightly taking the glasses off of my head.<br /><br />If the construction was better, i would give a much better rating because they look cool, feel great, and have great lenses for the price."
2.0,It’s ok but the picture shows a belt and..... there’s no belt. So I’ll return it I guess
2.0,Cant use on phone.
2.0,"These are cute, but not for a tall person (I am 5 ft. 9 inches and they were a couple inches short.)  also, sizing is waaaayyy off.  The XXL is supposed to be a US 12.  I am usually a US 10 and these were even close to zipping.  Probably because they sit on the hips more than the natural waist.  These are going back.  Material was nice though, very wide bottoms."
2.0,Not the quality I Expected. Graphics not sharp as I thought.
2.0,Poor quality !!
2.0,"Well, you get what you pay for. Fortunately, I didn't buy this for the purpose of wearing outside anywhere. It should be okay but I don't like the cuffs, and I Really don't like this zipper on the left side nonsense. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bothered."
2.0,"They were super cute and fit as expected. I had them less than a year and one of the heels came off. I'm talking about the little black stub at the bottom of the heels. It caused the heels to be different heights when I wore them and was causing back pain. So, I can't wear them anymore."
2.0,The bag handles are thin cheap plastic. I would have overlooked but the letters are badly misaligned. I’ve ordered two other similar bags on Amazon and letters none like this. Not worth the price. Returning.
2.0,Pepsi is having everything made in Pakastan and boy can you tell<br />Light weight-wear out very fast and shrink  What has happened to USA COTTON!
2.0,I ordered XL size which is usually my Norma size. It came very big and the material is very different from what is pictured. The length came beyond my knee and my height is 5’3”. Would definitely not recommend/buy again.
2.0,Not very satisfied with terrible paint job overspeay on ears. Lines aren't painted fully or straight. Came in a Amazon bag so mask is wrinkled and deformed. Haven't tried it on cause I have to air dry it for 2 days after handwashing it. price was way to high for lack of quality.
2.0,They don't stay up on my face. I have to use my overear headphones to hold them up by clamping the gaiter between my ear and the headphone cups. I won't be buying again and would recommend you look elsewhere.
2.0,"I'm 5'1&#34;, 116 lbs, 32DDD. I ordered a small first but it was huge so I exchanged it for an extra small. It fits but its very loose and wide. It's really cute looking, but not flattering enough on. It'll be a pool cover-up for sure."
2.0,"Bought this in black leather. It's squeaky! No joke...I sit in meetings and every time I move my wrist, this thing squeaks and causes a scene. It's also very thick and inflexible. It looks great, but from a comfort and annoyance level, I would not buy again."
2.0,Looks soooo cute. But not very well made. My zipper pulled off after one weekend of using it for my NPC Figure Competition. Love the looks but not a long term bag
2.0,Not what you Think!!<br />Very small
2.0,This was really long and extremely thin.
2.0,"The photo and description of this product doesn't match. It does say paisley but it also says plain sky. The photo is of a solid bandana which is what I was expecting. I ordered 4 colors and this was the major disappointment for the project I was working on. Overall the quality is good and the price is excellent, but beware what you order and send any questions to the seller before you purchase."
2.0,Material is cheap. Stretched out. Color and pattern not like picture. Save your money. Buy elsewhere
2.0,"I bought this watch for my brother for Christmas, and it looked lovely and came in a wonderful package.<br /><br />However since then it has stopped working. It will keep time for a couple hours, and then stop going, and then will start up again. It says its self winding and doesn't need to be wound, so I have no idea what to do.<br /><br />All in all a pretty watch, but I'm very disappointed in it's function."
2.0,"The tag says Large, but fits like a Small"
2.0,Very small and not really worth the money. The screw on end becomes loose easily and comes off and the keys fall off. I ended up losing it all together.
2.0,I got it today. Use it when I open it. I found the zipper of one of the storage bags was broken ，The zipper cracked，I can't pull it together anymore，The quality is really poor ......
2.0,Cheap! Will not purchase any more jewelry from amazon
2.0,"What's wrong with this equation? Material: 47% Polyamide + 45% Polyester + 9% Spandex?? That's 101%. This shirt is nylon polyester, the real shiny stretchy kind. Was really cheap so I bought 3. I need to workout anyway, was way smaller than I expected. Not sending back but not happy about difference between photo material and this material."
2.0,"Ordered these for a halloween costume (the white ones)... they work for that but I wouldn't wear them out anywhere otherwise! Fit just fine (a little long on me, but I'm 5'1) & definitely comfy and soft. BUT they are totally see through - so I am not sure where you would normally wear these!?"
2.0,Yeah it was beautiful but their size smaller than the chart so if you need a medium you better order a large and vice a versa
2.0,The mesh lining is printed with a camouflage pattern which shows through in blotches and makes the cap look dirty!
2.0,I love the necklace it was beautiful but I was sent the wrong color. It was suppose to be purple. I bought it for a family member for Christmas and their favorite color is purple. I'm a bit disappointed because it's too late to send back for a replacement.<br /><br />Gave it 2 stars because even though the color was wrong and it was too late to send back and get the correct color the necklace is still beautiful. Just hope they like the color.
2.0,"This is no fault of the manufacturer or the seller, it's just hard to tell the dimensions of a pair of glasses and how they'll sit on your face from a 2D image."
2.0,These are made of clay and gems. With a lot of wear the white clay turned yellow.
2.0,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! The necklace part fell off as soon as i put it on only giving 2 stars just cause its Stitch.
2.0,The sleeves are WAY TOO SHORT!! Description says long sleeve but closer to 3/4 than long sleeve. Can’t wear it. Looks ridiculous. Returning ASAP.
2.0,"Boot is excellent for what it was designed for: COMFORT!  If you have foot problems or just want to feel like you are wearing house slippers this is the boot for you.  Just don't expect real outdoor work utility.  Tongue in not gusseted at all and water will gush through just under the bottom lace eyelet.  Leather is so soft the slightest scrape makes a permanent mark.  Try to polish with paste  and get a slimy mess.  If you like the look of boots<br /> with a soft finish as a style statement and comfort, get it. If you need a real boot, look elsewhere.  My well broken Danner Quarrys are just as comfortable, a bit heavier, but offer real work protection and utility.<br /><br />BTW: my pair had one workmanship defect; the leather that holds the lace eyelets were not aligned on one shoe which caused the tongue to drop off to one side within 10 minutes of wearing.<br /><br />I ordered direct from dr comfort.<br /><br />I"
2.0,The material was extremely rigid and so it wasn't easy to put items inside and take them out again
