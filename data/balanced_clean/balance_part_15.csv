4.0,i love it!!! good quality and very versatile!!!
4.0,More form fitting than I prefer<br />Beautiful colors for summer.
4.0,"I bought this tie to use for my daughter's wedding. It was the perfect color and size, as listed. It was stiffer than I expected for a silk tie, but I like the decorative texture and it performed well."
4.0,"I bought this for my son's cake smash. The quality seems to be good, and the outfit is really cute. The pants are like a light twill that you would have for summer khakis. I wish they were more like actual khakis, but they're OK. The shirt is adorable, and the suspenders were the right size.<br /><br />Sizing is a bit odd. Initially I bought the 12-18 month size, but it was way too big. My son is tall for his age and doesn't have baby fat. I exchanged it for the 9-12. The 9-12 pants fit fine, but the shirt was really tight and it was hard getting him in it. It's also odd the tag is on the outside."
4.0,"Love these earrings, however a couple of them did come where the post was hooked to the ball on the back.  While I am able to get them in, it can be frustrating.<br />Dainty, comfortable and well made"
4.0,"This was a perfect jacket for my little sister to wear for my wedding. The jacket runs small, she normally wears a small but I ordered the medium and it fit perfect."
4.0,"Nice sockless socks.  I like the grip at the heel.  Colors are okay.  They do run a bit smaller than imagined.  I wear a 10.5, socks advertised at size 10-12 and I find them a bit tight."
4.0,This was a nice wrap/sarong. Very stylish. But the stitches ripped so easily. I got the seams torn for wearing once in the beach
4.0,This top is so cute! It is alittle sheer but the grey color doesnt show through too much. Thinking of getting the other colors too. I got a large because I am like a 12/14 & the fit is good.
4.0,Still good for what it is.
4.0,"Fits well, is pretty, and decent quality the only thing i don't like how its nowhere near as white in person as in the picture and for that reason i took off a star."
4.0,"Super cute. A little narrow in the toe area, I'd order a half size bigger if your foot is a little wide."
4.0,"This is the most badass wallet an Otaku can have, and holds a good amount of money. The card slots are kind of small though and it doesn't completely open all the way. Besides that I love it!"
4.0,"A little bit too thin for me, but great for the price"
4.0,"The dress looks exactly like the picture. However, my boobs were completely flattened in this dress while the rest of the dress looked fine. Be aware, this dress isn't great for the bigger breasted ladies!"
4.0,A beautiful dress bit the size run a bit bigger
4.0,"Super cute! The animal print dresses do not have real buttons, so you can’t actually unbutton anything but they look cute anyway. Super flattering and fun!!"
4.0,makes great glasses for Mrs. Claus
4.0,Good size board to use. Stickers were perfect. The only reason I did not do 5 stars is because I had to find a material to glue the poster onto. The poster is thick stock but you need something behind it.
4.0,"The dress is pretty. I got plenty compliments. However, I don’t know if it’s due to my larger breast, I could not figure out what to do with the tie part of the dress. It seemed awkwardly placed. It wasn’t acting like the picture.<br /><br />I did the best I could and still got compliments. That’s why I gave it a four instead of a five star rating.<br /><br />Im short so the length was decent for me. Please take note of you are taller.<br /><br />Decent quality, bright blue and no chemical like smell.<br /><br />I would buy again."
4.0,I don't remember getting this but If I did I love the clothes I get from you all
4.0,"Comfy for my sore finger joints, not super tight, more like a tiny hug. However, my fingers are on the thin side (ring finger is size 5) so these may be too much of a squeeze on larger hands. Pinky finger is too thin for a snug fit, but that's my finger's fault. :) My only complaint is that there were loose threads and I fear they may unravel a bit. For the price, though, I am really satisfied."
4.0,"The cotton fabric is a little heavier and stiffer than I wanted, but it doesn't have holes like my old ones, so I am pleased."
4.0,"The dress is very stretchy and comfortable. The length is best for heels, would be too long for flats. The ruching if not very obvious or defined. As a matter of fact, it disappeared completely on me."
4.0,great to wear under the helmet to capture sweat from running down on you face
4.0,"Doesn't fit my calves at all but I'm on the bigger side so I'm not surprised. Material was pretty good, but no stretch at all. I used it for a Halloween costume so it worked for what I needed it for"
4.0,They were a little small but overall they were nice for bracelets for my hostesses
4.0,Beanie is comfortable and the gator looks awkward.
4.0,Would have been so cute but I didnt get the wear it. It was very tight at the bust and very loose at the waist. The texture and color is amazing though.
4.0,"These are a great scripture case. I really like the material, and the front pocket. I was using a case previously that did not have the front zipper and this helped a lot with my notes and pen not falling out.<br />My only con would be is I wish they were a little wider. You can fit your scriptures in them (the big pocket), and nothing else. But you can stil have pen and notebook in the front pocket. But because they are tight your scriptures stay in good shape. So if you plan to use your scriptures for a long time this is perfect."
4.0,"For some odd reason when I would try to use the ball it came with to secure it, it would just fall out of place. Then when it wasn't in my ear it would twist on perfectly fine. I've never had that happen to me before. I just changed the ball for another one I have and it holds perfectly fine with that on my ear. That's the only reason it received 4 stars instead of 5 stars."
4.0,The extra large on Russells is larger than the extra large on Champion. Probably a large Russel would equal an extra large Champion.
4.0,It’s good value for Money.
4.0,Liked the fit for my young girl
4.0,"If you are thin it would fit perfectly, but having a fuller waist I had to make a few adjustments and it works as needed."
4.0,"Cute and looks like it will hold up for trip. Negative: it is probably going to fall off because the headband is so loose. It’s made with one of those cheap, skinny headbands."
4.0,Many different pieces and sizes. Goes great on silver chains.
4.0,Overall ok.  Short and slips off a lot.
4.0,"The fish came of the one, but other than that it’s very nice!"
4.0,These run small. I am normally an XL<br />But I ordered an XXL to be safe. But sadly it was still too small. Will return. But too bad because it it super cute and s great deal
4.0,They are comfortable. Would buy again in better colors.
4.0,"This is a very nice band.  Wish I could use it.  I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't realize this band would be attracted to so much  Very comfortable and because it is magnetic, its the perfect fit.  But it sticks to silverware, my metal desk top, tools, etc.  Something that's common sense, but I never thought about it before I purchased."
4.0,"I saw reviews said “gasoline smell “ it’s true!<br />It’s super stink smell like gasoline first open. Whole house smell stink . But , I washed with dish soap and put it out to balcony to dry out for a week . Inside out .  I think smell come from paint side (outside of mask) .<br />But, after week , smell is much better . It become only rubber smell which is can’t erase .I think Made from rubber material .<br />Now, after week later , you can enjoy this mask . :))"
4.0,They are cute and the attatched strings are sturdy but I would have preferred a string in the back that u didnt have to tie.
4.0,"It is really solid rain gear. It is very much waterproof, as a few Chicago storms have proven as I walked 1.25 miles to the office. I really like the pants. The pockets are big and keep my phone and wallet dry. The jacket is also very good, but you will get warm in it. It is not breathable. It is waterproof, so take that for what it's worth. I would not wear the jacket as a spring jacket because you will be sweating very quickly. It's a rain jacket. If you want to stay dry, this works fabulously. My only wish is that it had a hood. Sometimes you'd rather have a hood than use an umbrella. I imagine you'd feel like you were in a sauna if you had a hood on this jacket, though."
4.0,"Front strap too small not adjustable, other than that I would not have returned them."
4.0,The skirt has a short underneath with a pocket. The waist band is a bit tight and I only weigh 86 pounds and I am 5 feet tall. The color is not red but wine/burgundy. The skirt reaches on me to mid thigh but again I am ver short. Overall it is what I expected and will work when I go walking.
4.0,I received this long sleeved top a day early.  It looks like it is decently made.  I have not yet worn it. Looks like a good fit.  Company name is cute.  Lol.  Thinking about a couple more.
4.0,i get SO many compliments in this dress. Love it. Plan to buy any other colors/designs they have
4.0,Excellent quality. Glasses are tinted which helps for reading outside or when Auditorium lighting produces glare. But not good in low-lighting conditions.
4.0,The size was perfect. My wife loves it
4.0,"Fits big. I bought for my 7 year old who is pretty skinny, but that's why I bought the SM 4-6 expecting it to be a better fit than if I ordered her regular size 7. It fit well enough for her to wear trick or treating, it was just wider than I was expecting it to be. It's very pretty and she loves it."
4.0,"The red is a little orange. But, still very cute."
4.0,I ordered this bag to put my drawing supplies in so I could carry them with me.  I didn't want a huge bag nor one too small.  This one is just the right size.  I carry a medium and small sketch pad as well as a bag of drawing supplies and a pencil box.  There's more than enough room for all that stuff.  The bag itself is not heavy at all and I like the top zipper component so I don't have to worry about my stuff falling out if the bag gets tipped over.  It has a netted pocket on each side so I can carry a water bottle.  I'll probably order another one in pink since I like this grey one so much!!  Really good value for the money and it came quickly.
4.0,"Disclaimer. I’m a small person at 5’ tall. I bought this to wear over my sling post-shoulder surgery. It fits, and then some! I think they this one-sexed poncho would work on a tall, plus-sized person. Needless to say, it will go in the donation pile once the sling is off and I can put a coat on again."
4.0,"Okay so, the earrings you actually receive are nothing like the photos. BUT, I am not disappointed with what I received. I like the bee earrings and the eye ones. Overall good quality, doesn't make me itch or anything like that etc."
4.0,Quality shades.  Fast delivery...
4.0,It's ok. Nothing special
4.0,"Lovely earrings, very elegant."
4.0,This is the best bad I've found for my watch yet.  Only issue is magnet is not strong enough to keep it at position.  Have to adjust several times a day.
4.0,Was a decent bracelet want as heavy as I would of liked but good asst this price point was also smaller than the listed measurement
4.0,It’s really<br />Good 😂💯.highly recommend helps you sweat a lot
4.0,I love the style of these earings and they match a lot of items in the closet. I didn't like how one of the earings has a defect on the metal loop part though and it kind of rips my ear a little bit when going in.
4.0,With a smaller battery it didn't work.  Put in a bigger battery and works fine now.  Thank you!!
4.0,"Very pretty shoe, looks very nice and has a nice shape. Decent quality for the price, looks like it should last about 3 months."
4.0,Cute and stretches<br />Not for heavy chests
4.0,It was chosen for a friend that had breast cancer. She really liked it .I think that it was a little small for the average wrist. It was difficult to fasten without assisstance. I had to help her with it. Who will help next time she wants to wear.? Better fastner and little more lengthen needed.
4.0,Work just fine. But work even better if you use a fingernail emery board to roughen up the little knobs so they don't slip out of your fingers so easily.
4.0,Very pretty.  Runs small.
4.0,Great jacket just a bit small.
4.0,Looks really nice on my wife. Fit is actually pretty good. She’s 5’4” and 143 athletically built so hard to find suits that fit right.
4.0,"These are cute belly rings, but I thought they were gonna be bigger and softer rubber. The balls are small and the rubber is kind of hard.  I have one that I purchased at Walmart that has a larger ball, and the soft mushy rubber, and more spiky.  Anyways, they will work, just keep in mind the rubber end is smaller than the picture looks, and the rubber is a harder rubber.  These shipped directly from China, so if you have one you bought here in the US, don't think they will be like the US one.  But a good price for 10 of them. I just personally prefer the larger softer rubber spiky ball.  I would recommend."
4.0,"Cute shorts, thin inside liner... I wore an extra pair of bikini bottoms for more coverage"
4.0,"Bought this for my 4 year old, it’s that shines material and it’s very large but still pretty good for the price!"
4.0,These are lightweight and pull up or down. My kids didn't mind using them. They fit great
4.0,It is a great product for the value and perfect for Halloween.
4.0,Cute as can be willing to buy more. Shipping was great. Packaging fine. Only reason for 4 stars is the bow came undone and bows on legs didn’t last. But I would buy more
4.0,"The only downside to these beautiful pins is the size of the sharp end. It's so thick that it leaves a mark in clothing that's not a wide weave :( A little disappointing, but not the end of the world."
4.0,go by the measurements scale they offer and you will get the right fit
4.0,"Love these socks, only downside is the the tube hole is very small and can cut off circulation."
4.0,"Although these sunglasses look strange from the picture, they are actually very comfortable and look great while wearing them.  I'm the kind of person who likes to be different and I got these because they are definitely different.  They are made very sturdy and as u can see by the pic I'm sharing fit well even on wider faces  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
4.0,"very nice, but you cant really have a bust with this."
4.0,"These gloves are very nice.  The fit is good and they're comfortable.  I would have given it 5 stars except I felt the thumb is a little too long.  Other than that, they're great!"
4.0,Ordered this to wear for our upcoming trip to Disney. The ears look closer together than the picture but it’s still cute
4.0,Le gustaron mucho a mis hijas
4.0,"The quality of the product was good.  The fit was also good.  The fit was true to size.  The inner lining was not washed before application so a little stiff and shrunk a little.  The color bleeds in the first wash so wash with like colors.  It would be best to hand wash and line dry to minimize shrinkage and to not discolor other clothes.  Overall, I was impressed with the product and have purchase other items from this seller."
4.0,"These socks look as advertised but I did find the stitching at the top of the socks to be rather tight. The tightness does help the socks stay up, however I could barely get it over my calves. I ended up using my hands to loosen the tops of the socks and break some of the stitching so that I could put them on a little easier. Once I broke the top stitching of the socks I was able to get them on and I did not have any issues with the socks falling down. They worked for the costume I bought them for."
4.0,"I've enjoyed these thermals, especially the fleece-lined ones. They aren't extremely warm, but are a good layer. Size large fits me at 5'6&#34;, 140 lbs, although the arms are a little short on me, even for an underlayer.<br /><br />I'm deducting a star because the &#34;pink&#34; color looks nothing at all like the soft pink in the photo: it's darker and a hot pink, actually closer to the photo for burgundy. The dark green is great, though!"
4.0,"This is a versatile garment that can be used on the head and neck. A drawstring can tighten or completely close it at one end. The interior side is felt and the outside is knit. It is not the warmest or most well made, but will work in mild winters. It comes two to a pack. I only care for one of the designs in my pack, the argyle."
4.0,"I’m a true small and a small fit almost prefect, a tad big for my liking. The dress was just like the photos and is so cute. My only complaint is that it is slightly see through and material is a little thinner than it looks in the picture, would HAVE to wear nude bra and undies underneath or else you will be able to see them very noticeably."
4.0,"They are on the bigger side for a stud earing which I love. They are so cute, but I haven't worn them yet to say if they'll turn."
4.0,Enjoyed the colors and the fit for the most part. The shirt is warm and comfortable. Great for fall or early spring.
4.0,"Great fit, great price, good deal! Let's see how many washes it makes it through!"
4.0,"Bought it for a friend , she loved it . Fit and style is good ."
4.0,The outfit is really cute!! White you can always see thru a little so getting this a little bigger is suggested as you don’t want everyone to see your business. I am 5’1 167lbs and I am reordering a XL. I ended up not being able to return the item because of the COVID virus. The seller refunded me some of the money which I was good with. This company is really caring to its customers. I highly recommend this product. I can’t wait to wear this on my first cruise once the COVID virus is gone.
4.0,I love this bathing suit. I gave only four stars for the over lay top does run a bit small I ordered up a size and still to tight. But love the boy shorts and the under bikini top. Great colors been wearing everyday in pool
4.0,its a nice place to store your watches
4.0,Regular “wear around” sweat pants. Fit as expected.
4.0,"Cute, loose fitting casual dress for everyday errends. The material is light but not see through, and it is very comfy."
4.0,I've been wanting a mask strap for a while and this one is adorable.  I get to represent as an A.R.M.Y. at work and it also is a practical item to have. I love my TinyTan Suga!
4.0,African American art show
4.0,One of a kind shirt
4.0,Good Item. But it must be taken care of because it begins flaking off from the band.
4.0,Loved the look! Should have paid more attention to there being only one piece and not two.
4.0,It looks gorgeous.  Cannot wait to let my little one wear it but the sizing is a bit off so I will have to wait a little while.
4.0,The face on this watch is larger than a quarter. I'll never wear it.
4.0,I love it. Gave it a 4 because they don't ship to Australia.
4.0,"This is a nice set of bird charms. A lot of the large scale charms in the mix which are harder to use in my cases, but still very happy with my purchase."
4.0,Great top for the money. It came right on time and looks just like the picture.
4.0,like the design but since small for x-large
4.0,This is a great zip up hoodie or light jacket. Not being cotton it’s not very warm.
4.0,"They’re really flattering but run small. Im 5’4 & 150lb, small up top- I carry my weight in my bottom half and the larges were very snug!!! I could’ve gone with an XL."
4.0,Very nice watch band and just the right weight. It's comfortable and looks great. The band does not come with spring pins. You need a smaller diameter spring pin than most watches use.
4.0,"I gave this jacket to my son for his birthday and he loves it.  the fit is normal and quality is good.  When the hoodie is zipped up all the way (as in the picture), the eye holes don't line up with his eyes, even though he has a very big head and the jacket fits him appropriately.  the holes are spread much farther apart than normal eyes, so he can only look through one eye hole at a time.  He loves it in spite of this and usually wears it with the hood down anyway, so this isn't a big deal for us.  But, for the price, they should have taken more care in positioning the eye holes."
4.0,"Nice, I like it"
4.0,"The only bad thing I can find about this umbrella is its small size -- the C-hook is only 3 1/2 inches high by 2 1/8 inches wide, so my hand (my gloves are a standard men's Large) cannot fit through it to hang it off my wrist. The radius is about 22 inches, and the center rod is accordingly short, so I have to hold it higher than I'd like to keep it from brushing my head.<br /><br />In every other way, though, this is a wonder product. In the two weeks that I've had it, I've been out in the windy rain twice, and it's held up wonderfully both times, not even threatening to pull out of my grasp as other umbrellas have done in the past. It's easy to open and close, stands up on its own, and (despite the above issue) is easy to carry.<br /><br />For anyone smaller than me, I'd highly recommend buying this umbrella. Even for those my size and larger, unless you're unusually large, I still wouldn't exactly recommend against it.<br /><br />I vehemently do not regret this purchase; it's definitely money well spent!"
4.0,"I found a pair of these at a cheapo store but they scratched and wore out easily. I found these way better quality pair using a photo of el cheapos, and they arrived last week. I'm very well pleased! They came with a case, a cleaning cloth and... a pretty sturdy (for its size) micro screwdriver. I love the polarized lenses and the weight of them, although not heavy, gives them a confidence-boosting, well made feel. Plus, they look way cool and I get lots of compliments on them."
4.0,"Good quality, keep my daughter's feet warm. The only down side is that she can take them off very easily."
4.0,Good fit and cute very comfy to wear
4.0,I use it as a crown for Queen dolls!
4.0,"Ok, I had to return mine it was too small, it doesn't match the measurements. It was really cute, so I'm going to try and get a larger size<br /><br />I got Small/MED (I'm 34C- 5'4- 110LBS)  it was too small."
4.0,A little short - but can be altered or tied on a side knot for a cute fit
4.0,Very nice ring for the price
4.0,Got the blue.  Straps were a bit wide apart so tends to fall off shoulder the sleeves are a bit odd on my arms but would look fabulous on a slender woman with small boobs like the model
4.0,"Buena calidad, cómodos y fáciles de colocarse y quitarse"
4.0,"Nice Looking stylist watch,  used for casual wear anf for work . we like it. Thanks"
4.0,"They are mega cute, I just don't like how they slide down my septum, they look better when they are pushed up as high as they can go, but thats minor complaint for a cute product"
4.0,It's practical and sort of cute. The zippers are a little cheap but its not a bad bag for walking around the city. It's a good medium sized bag
4.0,Cute! Bought for my grandaughter
4.0,Comfortable and sturdy. Covers eye area more than adequate. Like receiving a brown and black pair. Recommend.
4.0,"These glasses are beautiful! I bought these frames to match my personality and I love them! The only reason why I gave them a 4 out of 5, was because you can barely see the blue color in the frames, unless you're in direct sunlight or if you're standing right in front of someone. Other than that, they're perfect."
4.0,"Comfortable, understated, accurate, but imprecise. My watch is stuck at 8:16:44. It just stays there forever.<br />I like the black color and how it is not flashy. Except for the little green light."
4.0,This Corset is beautifully made of quality fabrics but runs much smaller than the recommended measurements indicate.  I plan to reorder this product in a larger size but had to send the first one back.
4.0,"Very good protection for your Versa 2 but with a couple of cons.<br /><br />PROS: This case fits the Versa 2 like a glove and is not hard to put on or take off.  It maintains the touch aspect of the Versa 2 watch screen fairly well.  At a glance it looks stylish.<br /><br />CONS: I found this Versa 2 case adds a little too much bulk to my watch for my taste.  Surprisingly the screen of the UMTELE case suffered a smudge type scratch across 3/4 of its face within a week.  I thought maybe it could buff it out but it wasn't possible.  Also, I found the Versa 2 side button more difficult press with the case on.<br /><br />I'm giving the case 4 starts because it does what it is supposed to do, protect the screen of your Versa 2.  However because of the case's bulk and having it scratch within a week I am going back to a wet application screen protector for my Versa 2.  Unfortunately the problem with those type screen protectors is you will end up replacing them fairly often because they don't stay in place.  The real solution here is Fitbit needs to step up and put a more scratch resistant glass on their screens."
4.0,The hoodie was delivered before it was expected which was wonderful.  Have had an issue with the stiching on one top corner and one bottom corner of the pocket but was easily repaired.
4.0,Longer and wider than I expected but it’s a cute dress.  The top half is a little stiff and will definitely need to be washed first.
4.0,"I like this a lot, but the scoop neck is a bit smaller than I was hoping.  It doesn't really hang off the shoulder the way I wanted.  It's still really, really comfortable though and looks great."
4.0,Good quality. Fabric is good quality and nicely made. Size runs one lower. Bought this for my mother who is a large and somehow I bought XL hoping it's bigger than smaller. XL fits her perfectly.
4.0,The mask was great other than the fact that it's eye holes were too low and the mask was very big for the average head size. I got the latex smell out by throwing it in the washing machine for a cycle. I wore it around Target and it got lots of attention!
4.0,They wrinkle a lot after being washed and seemed to shrink
4.0,Works great but if you have a lot of cards this might not be the best choice for you
4.0,This was given as a gift.  It was very pretty.  I was happy with the transaction.
4.0,Ok...kind of small for me but I hope it stretches out. Holds my hair back and keeps my ears warm..
4.0,"Pros: nice feel, good quality<br />Cons: a little small, haven’t tested it in temps any lower then 32 degrees yet but they were adequate not too sure about the 30 below claim."
4.0,Fits 22mm perfectly. Seems to be of good quality.
4.0,"As others have stated, this thing was way too long. But I knew this going in so i had to cut some of the stem off to get it to fit. Looks great though and I'm well satisfied so far..."
4.0,keeps toes warm over second sock for cycling. good calf support. good value and visibility.
4.0,Tried them on and they fit fine. I think they will do the trick.
4.0,"I really like this running bra.  I wear a 38D, and I like the girls to stay very still when I am running.  This bra is comfortable and very supportive.  The only thing I did not love is the keyhole style of the clasp in back.  You have to clasp the strap at the top and also at the bottom.  Thank goodness for yoga or I would never be able to stretch my arms high enough up my back to reach that top clasp.  It looks really nice, but it is not completely practical.  However, the price is very reasonable, and I do like the bra a lot, so I am going to buy a few more."
4.0,Really glad that I listened to teh other reviews and got the large.  I'm 5'2'' and 110 normally (currently 5 months pregnant so new I needed something larger and stretchy)  I've only put on 8 lbs but do have my belly :)  The large fits great.  Stretchy material is great.  I can't imagine I could have fit into the small or medium even not being pregnant though.  This runs really small.
4.0,Quality is good but my toes are not so big so it just fit me perfectly. I don’t think is good for people with big toes.
4.0,It will do just fine.
4.0,it fit perfect but hood is too big and it will cover my eyes.
4.0,Quality is fair as the metal is very soft so you wouldn't want to bend it too much or it may break. it looks cute on and I like it and I'm glad I bought it.
4.0,Comfy & fit well
4.0,"They are great, warm and thin enough."
4.0,Looks not bad not sure about the quality
4.0,"Very happy with this purchase, brought these in memory of my brother who passed away and who is now my angel.  Great size for me they might be a little big for people who perfer small stud earrings. These have become my everyday  earrings."
4.0,Good shoe and so cute! Love it
4.0,At first ow was stiff and weird. But you just have to stretch them out until the slouch like they are meant to. Other than that I love it.
4.0,Not comfortable; but pretty
4.0,"Pretty much as I expected, I wanted something to cuddle up in, silk is nice but not really cuddly."
4.0,"The seam at waist was open. I didn't send it back , just fixed it myself."
4.0,These were the perfect pants for my camping trip!
4.0,"Wanted to love this dress, it’s so pretty<br />For reference my measurements: hips 40”, bust 39”, waist 31”<br /><br />Pros: - beautiful fabric/ print<br />-made well<br />- loved the fit<br />- very feminine with the ruffles<br /><br />Cons: - skirt not long enough<br />- string that ties in the back is too long<br />- front angle sorta angels where it perfectly swoops under your belly (not great for a postpartum belly)<br />-this skirt was not made for a butt, immediately shows entire butt when you bend over. Barely covers it when standing<br /><br />Not really a con but I had no idea this dress laced up in the back when I ordered it. How did I miss that?"
4.0,Pretty but little large
4.0,"Cute, not heavy at all, gold tone is really good but they are smaller than I hoped"
4.0,Cheap material  like wearing  plastic
4.0,It looked pretty but not for every day use. This is more of a night out type of bracelet.
4.0,"These nightgowns are PERFECT for when you are pregnant and your bump gets too big for you to fit in your regular pajamas. The button-down front will provide easy breastfeeding access after the little one is here. I have 3 different colors. I'm taking away one star because, at the time of my purchase, the product listing for these nightgowns said they were made of cotton. It appears as though that has since been corrected, but I have bought from this listing on two separate occasions, with the listing saying they were cotton each time. Other than that I would give the item 5 stars. They are not cute and you will look frumpy in the nightgown, but who cares? At almost 35 weeks pregnant they are some the most comfortable things I own and I'm very glad I bought them."
4.0,"This dress was everything!!!! Very sexy but the bottom portion was very tight. I purchased my actual size, and XL, however, my butt hung out a little which wasn't good. The bottom part f the dress has NO stretch to it so it was extremely tight and ultimately was the reason that I sent it back. It was very ling however, I'm 5'8"" and it still hit the floor with heels on which was great for me."
4.0,I thought these would be like some my husband already had that clip on but have the look of button on.  Now I need to see if there is an adapter that will convert them to what I thought I was getting.  They look nice but I can't speak to anything else until I find a way to make them useful to us
4.0,"Love this little outfit. I got it for my baby to wear for his first Christmas, it looks so cute on him. The penguins print are adorable. I got this product a little over a month before the holiday, since my baby was a premie, it still fits him perfectly when it was time for him to finally wear it. I only gave it a 4 stars because the label &#34;My 1st Christmas&#34; was a little too small to see or read on the left chest area."
4.0,"Love the look and clean lines, but a little boxier with shorter arm length than my other grace Karin pieces. Just not a good fit for my body"
4.0,I love the colors on this dress.  I plan to take it on my next cruise.  It is a little longer or I am a little shorter than I thought.
4.0,"It's very tight around the neck , feels like I'm being chocked. The rest seems to fit ok. I would recommend ordering a sixe up for more comfort."
4.0,Not bad :)
4.0,"I call my daughter Goose and I have since she was little. So I always buy her goose themed stuff and this was this years Christmas goose item. She loves these enamel pins and has a LOT of them on her purse and she must really like it because it immediately went on her purse display which is reserved for the favorite ones she has. Well made, super cute, definitely recommend if you are in the enamel goose pin market."
4.0,Gave as a gift...
4.0,so far I love to wear it! the design is great! not sure whether it will keep shinning for a long time. let's see...
4.0,"I love the pattern and fit of the dress. I'm 5' 10&#34; and 145 lbs. I ordered a medium and it was large so the small fit great. The return was a breeze. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is the pattern doesn't match at the seams, but for the price I'm happy."
4.0,Band unbelievable to open
4.0,"Bit larger than expected, but I love it nonetheless."
4.0,"I purchased the white dress and its lovely ,although, I wish I would have sized down. I am a size 8 in most clothes and I ordered the medium,I usually order a size larger on Amazon, this time I stuck to my usual size but I should have gotten the small, its too wide, Im going to wash and dry it and hopefully shrink it a bit."
4.0,"Very cute and nice packaging. Adorable gift, not sure if it’s going to last but fingers are crossed."
4.0,"Very fluffy nerdy slippers!<br /><br />Just a note...these may terrorize your small furry animals. I got these as a gift for my sister and her cat is terrified of these and flees the room when she enters wearing them, haha."
4.0,"I went a all white party recently and received a lot of compliments. Even though the dress was a little long for 5’5” person, I was able to wear 1” to 2” heels for this dress. The material is easy wash and wear."
4.0,I really like this little dragon whispering in my ear. I had to double check how to wear it because an ear wrap fits a little different than an ear cuff - but a bit of practice and we are flying! ;-)<br /><br />0
4.0,"Absolutely loved this dress! Green color is beautiful. My daughter wore it for her graduation and it looked great on her. However, be careful with the zipper. Ours broke and we  now go get that fixed."
4.0,Husband likes both chains that I ordered.
4.0,These socks are are comfortable and fit well.  A bit thicker than I had expected...
4.0,My wife loves it and it is a good price.
4.0,"The look and feel of these jeans is really nice, and they appear to be much more expensive than they are from afar.  However the button hole is totally ""off,"" meaning that you really can't button the jeans without wrestling them into the button.  Little details like that are frustrating and keep me from giving this five stars."
4.0,Larger than they look.
4.0,Worked great with my costume. Need to come down on the price.
4.0,Great pair of any earrings for any Texas chainsaw fans! The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the chainsaw earring is a bit small compared to Leatherface.
4.0,very comfortable shorts. Love them.
4.0,Very beautiful dress but was so disappointed because across the bust is so tight; apart from the chest area the dress fit nicely but they need to put more material in the bust area
4.0,the quality of the leather seems cheep.
4.0,"I really like this shirt. It fits as expected, very comfortable."
4.0,I like the f el of the material. Pockets are a little droopy but all said nice layering piece.
4.0,It didn't line up correctly on my face so I gave it to a friend who likes it very very much.
4.0,Very cute. My daughter is going to wear it in my wedding and it will be exactly what we need.
4.0,"Very cute, touch of bling, price."
4.0,"Loved the floral pattern and style. However, chest area was too tight/not true to size guide & measurements."
4.0,Love my sweater.
4.0,This is a cute bracelet.  The clasp has a pretty shape but it's hard to hook on to the chain part.
4.0,These are very good quality work out pants. They definitely keep you warm. I would say they run just a tiny bit on the large side with plenty of stretch.
4.0,"The title says &#34;loose fit&#34;, but I wouldn't describe it as such.  If you'll notice in the picture, the sleeves are cut at an angle and are a bit shorter than those on most tee-shirts.  If you think your upper arms are fat and don't like showing them, I'd probably go with a different style shirt.  I actually haven't worn it and washed it enough to comment on it's durability."
4.0,"Nice cap. Feels like a good fit. Slightly overpriced though, in my opinion. Yet to check it in cold weather, but looks like it's inner lining will keep me warm."
4.0,"This is not gray, it's more of a light blue.  It's also made of polyester and spandex.  Wish it was made more like a sweatshirt material.  Not a fan of light blue, so I'm returning it."
4.0,Still love the bag but it way smaller than i imagine so im kinda upset otherwise than that its nice quality
4.0,"Beautiful shoe.  I have a slightly wide foot (not enough to order wide width) and this shoe is a little snug across my toes.  But otherwise, I love them."
4.0,Smaller than I expected but it works fine on the tennis courts.
4.0,"I bought this for my husband. It seem to be very nice quality. It was a little lager than other button down shirts, I've bought him. We will see if it shrinks in the wash."
4.0,These are good for the purpose we all are buying them for. I find they are not comfortable to fit but it may be my face is just to round.
4.0,"Dress was very pretty, but was too small for me."
4.0,"I like the gloves, although I have not yet worn them in the Minnesota cold. I find them a little difficult to get on, with the separate lining, but like the idea of not having the wool right against my skin. The Bow is a bit bigger than expected, but OK, and I am not sure what color I ordered, but it definitely isnt black. They will work fine for wearing to work."
4.0,I am a nurse and work 12 hrs I like the fit and fun design super affordable for how many you get
4.0,"My fault, I didn’t realize that these had a strap that goes around your head, and not just around the ears.  With that being said, they are good quality"
4.0,Prefer the black ones but this is ok
4.0,"It was really cute. The only problems I noticed, were that the chain kept coming undone and be aware that the charms sometimes get up into the owl's head."
4.0,This fits far more clingy than I had in mind. It's a stretchy material and if that's what you are going for...This dress is for you!! I'm 5'4 and it came to my knees.
4.0,"The leather is great, but the snaps were broken on one of the two belts I received.  Could not install the buckle because of it. I did not contact the seller about this as yet, but I will be placing a reorder and hope to get good snaps on the new belts I receive."
4.0,"I wear a size 8.5 and ordered the sz 40.  Just fits comfortably, snug with socks.  I pulled out the liner for extra room.  Did not have high expectations, but these are actually super comfortable and look great. Note that they do not have any arch support if this is an issue.  Have water-proofed and worn outside, all day. May change the fastening to hidden Velcro as they are a bit loose and tricky to fasten in a hurry, otherwise these are great shoes.  I have ordered similar in a different color."
4.0,Sun protection is good. The only thing is that the pockets hang down below the bottom of the shirt.  The pockets are too loose. Otherwise a great fit.
4.0,Dope Clean jeans
4.0,"Purchased two of different colors. They are somewhat shear but I live in Miami so that works for me. Being linen, a need to iron may be your preference. If not they still look great. Color description are a bit off but still pretty."
4.0,"LOVE the Print, But Wish it had a Nose-Piece for safety & comfort."
4.0,The bracelet is pretty and I would have kept it but it was too tight on my wrist
4.0,Doesn't hold breasts very well even when tightened.
4.0,Fits but show all your curves even the mini stomach pudges
4.0,Can't beat them for the money.  Usually a medium so I got the large and I'm happy with the fit.  Didn't seem as revealing as other had suggested.
4.0,Pretty good strap. I was looking for something to dress down a bambino that I got for Xmas since I’m not a suit and tie kinda guy and it definitely does the trick. Just wish the leather was a little better quality. It’s a very soft leather so we’ll see how it holds up. I can’t complain too much though since it can be difficult to find a decent 21mm strap.
4.0,Like the color but disappointed with the fit.  I’ll keep it anyway to wear around the house.  Seems well made.
4.0,"Freshly painted and beautiful..... it’s a little warped but I can fix that. The keychain falls off but if you bend the pin then it works. All in all, great product!"
4.0,Ok I guess seen it today thought it would be a dark black and not that washed 1000 times black..but other then that item is new and as advertised!
4.0,I couldn't wait to get this I'm the mail and for a good price. I was a bit disappointed because t isn't black and white it's more of an off white/pale stained yellow and white. I'm not sure what to wear with it now. and the elbow patches are not on my elbows.
4.0,"For the price these are nice shoes. Very cute and easy for kiddos to get on by themselves. I'd hoped they would be my daughter's every day shoes for school. I have my doubts they will hold up for a whole season, the hook and loop straps are very thin/flimsy. Mine arrived damaged but for $10, definitely not worth exchanging."
4.0,This product was way too dope. Women were hanging all over me when I wore it. Like catnip to kitties.
4.0,"The red color is beautiful and the quality is nice, but way too big for me and very flat."
4.0,"Love the size of the big watch face, and it is surprisingly easy to read. I think the band is made of rubber though. I wanted it to wear during the Christmas holidays, but the color is a bit too orange-y. The price was great."
4.0,These are great slippers. We did have to return the first pair. They do run small but the quality is great. Order the next size up if you order these.
4.0,This is a nice sweater that has stood up to a few washings so far. It's thick and well made.
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised!! I was skeptical of solid gold bar earrings for well under $100. They look great and appear to be pure gold; I have had no allergic reactions as I do when I wear earrings of alloyed or mixed metals. The thickness was a nice surprise, too. They really are a raised bar earring, not the skimpy thin flat staple styles that feel like they might bend.<br /><br />They are also much less yellow in color than the image, a very sophisticated elegant gold tone with a nice polish. I will purchase other styles from this vendor! Knocked off one star because I really do not understand how solid gold at this weight can be this inexpensive."
4.0,On time and enjoying it
4.0,Very pretty and colorful ring but would have preferred a slightly smaller stone if it had been available.
4.0,"These are great and comfy. They do keep falling off when I move, so maybe size down."
4.0,The pins themselves are nice. I didn't realize it was random so I got 2 sets of suits and no cards.... But that seems better than others who got all of one suit....  😅 I put them in my mesh ball cap and they have held well.
4.0,"I love this shirt.  I am a petite and slim gal.  (5'1 109lbs)  I ordered xs. Its kinda big, but I still like it.  Its stylish and affordable."
4.0,"I really like the look and feel of it. I'm now a pocket watch person because of this watch. It doesn't always work, be careful not to drop it (self explanatory). But, such is expected by something at such a low price."
4.0,Love it!! It ran somewhat small so i had to take it in to have it altered. Othere then that its perfect!
4.0,Does not fit with glasses
4.0,"Not bad.  Hopefully, my client will like it.  If so will order again.  Thank you."
4.0,I may buy me one too.  I bought these for my sons to have for the rest of there lives.  We'll see how that works.
4.0,"Fabric could have been just a ltiny bit softer and stretchier (but by no means is it restricting). Overall, for the price I love it and will buy more."
4.0,Item as described. Cute key chain or project bag charm. Arrived in about 3 weeks.
4.0,Good product along with being a good idea!
4.0,"These seem like nice leather gloves.  They took awhile to come as they came from the UK, but my daughter liked them, especially the buttons on the cuffs."
4.0,Love 'em!!  I'm able to walk much better.  I'm looking forward to having a second pair of Vionics.
4.0,"I love Allegra K clothes but unfortunately I had to return this dress. While the fabric and the fit were perfect for my liking, the color seemed to be a bit off (darker than on the pictures) and did not suit me at all."
4.0,I may have put it on wrong but it makes my girls look like a couple of Pancakes
4.0,"I am 5'5&#34; and 130lbs and ordered a medium. Overall this fits ok. Had I been any taller it would not have fit well. The torso portion was slightly tight length wise. The &#34;pant&#34; portion hit me right at the ankles, which was fine for wearing with heels. Overall, about what I expected for the price."
4.0,love it just a bit tight around the arms and gets a little tighter around the hips
4.0,"Great, versatile shoe. Dresses up jeans and can also be worn to work."
4.0,True to size fits nice great quality 👌
4.0,It fits.b Wish it came in other colors
4.0,"These are nice packing cubes, however, quite a bit thinner than some of the other sets I've bought in the past."
4.0,"I love the way this necklace looks. The chain is a cheap material so I'm always afraid its going to snap, but it's worth it for the price!"
4.0,It's really good compared to the price I paid
4.0,Same as the white ones. They were okay. Best thing about them is they didnt hold the smell unlike most acrylic.
4.0,MY daughter loves this dress. For the price it is pretty but it seems a bit cheap to me and was quiet big on my almost 5 year old and I ordered the 4.
4.0,"Bought this for a boho Birthday party and it was perfect! A little lightweight and took a few tries to get it wrapped correctly, but it did the trick! I got so many compliments on it and felt beautiful in it! For reference, I’m 5”4 and 160lbs. The one size worked perfectly for me."
4.0,Fits better than I expected. I ordered the purple....it is closer to lavender. Still love it!
4.0,The suit itself was very nice. Ruching to cover mom tummy and fit my normal size but I was looking for a hot pink bathing suit and this was neon. Disappointing because it seemed well made.
4.0,"Tight in the shoulders, not see through, as short as the picture."
4.0,"Very odd, I love it 😍"
4.0,"Product is great for the price. Lights shine VERY bright and against the wall.  Rubber bands tend to fall off fingers easily but fun for the kids. Great for theme parks, city life, parades, ect"
4.0,He didn't like this at all. It is very big. I like all the features but be aware of the size. Prob best for bigger dudes
4.0,"He didn't get one when he joined,gave it to him for his birthday. He loved it!"
4.0,"The product quality is great. The finish has yet to deteriorate. The only issue I am having, not the product/manufacturer's fault, is the size of my smart keyfob for a 2017 model car. My key's slot for keychains is just too narrow, so I can't overlap the keychain on top of the key. I still use it regardless, because this thing is just that classy. It's simple, but very elegant. If they don't know what kind of car I have, they assume I drive a $80k+ car instead of the actual $35k based on the keychain and matching key fob alone."
4.0,Good price... fits fine. It's a flip flop
4.0,"I bought these to take on vacation. They are inexpensive, comfortable, and lightweight. Good when you don't want to spend too much money."
4.0,"Lightweight, breathable mask that doesn’t fog your glasses!"
4.0,"Gave them 5 stars, but was reminded that 1 pair came with a hole in pocket (like they totally missed the bottom stitch) so dropped it to 4 stars.. It is an easy fix so i would still recommend them."
4.0,"The earrings arrived not as shown.  They are an irregular shape, but the color is beautiful."
4.0,Great hoodie as expected from Under Armour
4.0,No pockets!!! They are super soft and comfy though
4.0,The dress looked exactly as the picture. She was quite happy to try it on. However it doesn't have much stretch. I ordered a 14/16 the dress fit my daughter length wise but in the bust ( she has none) it was way to small like 10/12.
4.0,"This suit feels like the great quality we have come to expect from Speedo.  There are little sticky spots along the bottom to prevent cheeks from peeking out, and the colors are super fun.  The only issue we had was size:  for comparison, at the store with the red bull's eye, my 6.5 yr old daughter is a size 6 top, a girl's size 4/5 bottom, skinny for her age, and has a long-ish torso.  I originally ordered a 6 thinking it would be spot on, but was surprised to find it was very tight on her.  She couldn't pull the straps up enough to get her arms through the holes.  We ended up ordering the 7, which was much more comfortable."
4.0,"Muy lindo el conjunto, la blusa un poco grande para mi hija, la talla corre un poco grande en la blusa."
4.0,"Loved this fabric, it has a lovely sheen, rich color and nice drape.  My measurements are 39B/37W/41H,  I ordered the xl and it was a bit too snug. I am 5&#34;8&#34; tall and the length was perfect."
4.0,"I got this for my son for Xmas. He wears Men's medium, but I had to buy large in this one. He wanted a half black, half white sweater or sweatshirt. I was like ""where am I going to find that??"" Well, on Amazon of course!"
4.0,would be perfect except the sides near the breasts need tucking  nice length -
4.0,My daughter loves these! She has a color for each outfit! Super affordable way to accessorize!
4.0,Just what I was wanting. Studs earrings that I can sleep wearing.
4.0,No touch screen feature
4.0,"Dress runs slightly big. I'm 5'3&quot;, 125 pounds and I ordered a small. The dress itself is pretty loose, but I love it! It's cute and the perfect length!"
4.0,I'm 5'4&#34; & 118 lbs. This is cute for summer use.
4.0,Fits well and is very cool. Dont need chami underneath. Washed twice and hung dry.
4.0,"I'm a crossdresser, and as such, I can't get enough dresses. I enjoy wearing dresses around my house and I have lots of them. This dress is pretty and well made."
4.0,"I purchased this coat in a size 8, cobalt. At first I was sent the wrong size, which I returned. Then I got my normal size. My measurements are 36-29-39, and the 8 fit me with room for a substantial cardigan sweater layered beneath. I am 5'9&#34; and find the sleeves to be just the right length. The coat finishes slightly above my knee.<br /><br />This is a top coat, so it is not especially warm, but I have worn it out in ~30 F weather the last few days and have been comfortable.<br /><br />I do not find the wool to be itchy at all. The photo on the site makes the coat look a little bit more purply/indigo than it actually is. The color is more of a true cobalt blue.<br /><br />Overall it is a beautiful coat that makes a statement without being too over the top. My favorite features, besides the color, are the gold buttons, the back pleat, and its subtle fit-and-flare silhouette. There are a lot of sack coats this season and I wanted something that would complement my figure. I think this coat would look great with a dress!"
4.0,I love the way it fit just right
4.0,A little see through but other then that good quality.
4.0,Gave as birthday gift and it was well loved! Super cute and dainty.
4.0,Many compliments!!!!  Very pretty!  Will buy more in different colors if ever available!  Item just as described.  Thank you so much!
4.0,A little expensive for sandals but I do like the softer material.  Very comfortable and stylish.  The downside to the softer material is that it is easier to wear down.
4.0,Fit nicely over all my glasses.  Not too large either.
4.0,Not so big thats it gaudy but still stands out.  Gave this to the misses as a Christmas gift and she seems to be enjoying it as she wore it several times.  Stone I received was a wee bit lighter in color than the pic provided with this listing.
4.0,"It's a cute top, nice and thick material (but not sweater thick, just to where you can tell it's good quality). I bought a medium and it's too big for the form fitting look I wanted, so I am exchanging it for a small. I'm 125 lbs 5'6&#34; 34C"
4.0,"Had to send back for a smaller size...I was hoping for sleeves seamed at the shoulder - which is the impression I got from the photo, but this sweater has the seam lower down."
4.0,"Love these boots! Cute, easy to wear, comfortable, not sure what to use on this leather to clean/protect because I don't want to take away the matt finish, but other than that, great boot! Solid sole, shoes are very comfortable, with it flipped up or down. Wish the tassles were removable, sometimes you want them, sometimes you don't! Recommend these for all ages and all year round."
4.0,Did not come as shown on the picture. I'm normally a medium but I ordered an large based off the feedback. You still get the lace and color but it's not as loose as it shows on the photo. It's form fitted on me. I do like the shirt a lot but I would say to order two times larger if you want it loose and order it one time larger if you wanted it fitted.
4.0,Bought for my 7 year old who is obsessed with chokers. Cute necklace. Good fit.
4.0,"This thing is cute and will work perfectly for a medusa costume. However the green paint flakes off really badly (see pic of my bathroom floor... this was after trying it on once).<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with it, but I need to hit it with some clear spray paint before wearing this for real"
4.0,This is the second pair of these pants I’ve gotten so I like them but I ordered the ink blue and they are way lighter than what’s shown in the picture. Way more periwinkle blue than grey blue. I feel like I’m wearing hospital scrubs…
4.0,Cute shirt! It’s a little loose on chest and shoulder area. Definitely need a camisole under.
4.0,"Purchased as a gift, but the socks were too small for adult male with foot size 10-12.  I gave them to another friend who is enjoying them."
4.0,Quality replacement band that works perfectly and actually feels nicer than one shipped with fitbit
4.0,"The band looks great on the Alta, it looks like it would be comfortable to wear. The only problem is that the sizing isn't correct.  I have a 6.5 inch wrist and this is way too big for me. I am pretty bummed that it doesnt fit as the look is great!"
4.0,Definitely fits the watch—easy on/off. I bought the white/rose gold garmin and really the only strap that looks good with it is the white one that came with it.
4.0,a little small as I expected
4.0,This sports bra is very comfortable.  It would be great if the back straps were a bit sturdier; but I still prefer this bra for my workouts over some others.
4.0,The bottom piece is great for a costume but the top is extremely small and I don’t not have big breast. I had to cut the top to use this
4.0,Good quality well made. Only reason not 5 stars is because I would like to see it to be a little smaller for a woman's wrist.
4.0,"tl;dr - Good product for the price. At $15 you would be hard pressed to get a sport shirt of higher quality. If are willing to spend 2x - 4x more, buy the name brands. If you are price sensitive, I think this is a winner.<br /><br />Full Review<br /><br />Initial impression:<br />The shirt had a strong chemical odor when I first got it. At least it was brand new, right? The smell faded on the first wearing. The stitching is pretty wide and not in a good way. This doesn't look like a piece of gear I'm going to own for many years. One thread stitch even looks like it's coming undone.<br /><br />Materials<br />The colors and materials are surprisingly good. There are over a dozen options for this shirt. I think you can easily find the colors you want. The material is a little thin, but seems to be good quality. It's similar to other &#34;rash guard&#34; material shirts that I have. I would look over the seams carefully after it arrives in your mailbox.<br /><br />Fit<br />I bought an US Large size and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a true fit. I would even call the cut a little on the generous side for a &#34;compression&#34; shirt. I'm 5' 7&#34; and 197 lbs. The large fits me and isn't too tight. Pretty good right? Contrary to another review (and I'm not saying they're wrong), the arms on my shirt are a little longer than I expected. Of course I did get a L and I'm 5'7&#34;.<br /><br />Performance<br />I've only worn this once, but the materials seem like they will get the job done. I never got too hot and the materials didn't cling to me.<br /><br />Overall<br />I'm impressed with the quality of the shirt, especially for the price you pay. A premium brand for this type of shirt can cost you 4x what you pay here. You are definitely not getting 400% better performance. If this shirt holds up I will be getting more for my backpacking trips.<br /><br />Bottom line<br />Recommended.<br />I am very happy I picked this shirt up. I am fully confident that it will serve me well while I'm outdoors."
4.0,"There a bit tough to get on, but my nephew has chubby feet so I just have to unlace them as much as possible."
4.0,"The suit is amazing, my only complaint is the hood is massive. Literally not even close to being the right size for 4T. Quality and look is awesome though."
4.0,I couldn't figure out the adjustment ... other than that I like it.
4.0,Washes up nicely. Fits as expected.  Soft and comfy. Love it.
4.0,Help a lot with the workouts and shin splints
4.0,"The bottoms fit perfectly, the top however is way too short and tight"
4.0,Material is beautiful. It fits like a dream. I’m an 18/2x almost anywhere and an 18 fits perfectly. The only downside is how short it is. I’m 5’9 and this is too short for my office job.
4.0,Wonderful soft materials and looks very nice.  That material attracts lint heavily but worth the extra care.  Sleeves are snug.
4.0,This dress is too short to wear as a dress but as a tunic with some jeans it is really cute.
4.0,Cute but the fit was somewhat small
4.0,"It is cute, I like it"
4.0,They are a little snug when you first get them but they stretch as you wear them. I am vey hard on indoor/outdoor slippers. This is my second pair and I love them. They are a little warm in the summertime but I still wear them year round.
4.0,Love how thin but sturdy this material is. Very soft.
4.0,"Nice dress, but I wish they offered it in petite.  Don't know if I want to spend $20.00 to get a $35.00 dress altered.  Also wish it came in a different color, don't particularly like dark green."
4.0,"The area where the necklace connects to the stone is a week link, wears out quickly. Soft stone which can break easy. But it is quite a pretty item."
4.0,"I kid. This twill cap isn't the most stylish one on the market, but it fits really comfortably and gets the job done. It certainly looks better than a snapback/baseball cap."
4.0,My grand daughter loved this choker.
4.0,Appears clean cut and blends with most colors / suit combinations.  Great tie clip with solid construction and functions as intended.
4.0,"Very nice, fast shipping!"
4.0,Weird clasp but very pretty
4.0,Nice dress for the price
4.0,Spacious very convinent
4.0,"The grey side is great! It claims it’s reversible and while that’s true, the orange side has visible clasps and that stand out and make it look non-uniform. Nit picking here but I was hoping it would be clean looking like the other side. Sturdy and reliable and great for the price."
4.0,I usually wear a small and ordered a small. The dress is very loose and flowy. The arms fit well and the length was just right.
4.0,Very nice belt for price !! Sizes run small just like it says. But I love it .
4.0,"this shirt is great... you can put on your favorite jeans and this top and look fabulous.  I love it. casual, cute and comfortable.  the material is good, and I like the waffle style to the material."
4.0,Pretty but a little bigger than expected. It's not heavy though so that's a plus.
4.0,"I agree with the other review that this is very short. However, I have short legs, so this is not a huge deal to me. The slit on the sides reaches just slightly under my butt. I would wear my boy shorts under this to be safe.<br /><br />If you have longer legs, this would probably work as a beach cover-up."
4.0,cute festival wear
4.0,"Was expecting this to be a little heavier weight, it's kind of like a bubble gum toy metal. But it's meant to help my husband when he's frustrated so he won't click pens :o"
4.0,"Was a new locket; however, the clasp broke within a few weeks and I lost my charms. This was probably a user-issue. The locket fell from my dresser, and I did not inspect it for damage. When the item came new, it was quite beautiful.  The rose gold tone is true to color."
4.0,"Beautiful wachter, the only thing I didn't like is the lock,its uncomfortable but other than that its perfect."
4.0,"These work really well. But they don't look very good under clothes if you go too small (haha). I should have upped the size but it wasn't available. If you want to walk around your SO with this on though, they'll probably dig it because without clothes on it's extremely flattering and VERY cheap for what it does. I like it a lot. I just didn't get the right size but no regrets :)"
4.0,"Fits like a size smaller. I'd order one size up, but it's very comfy and cute."
4.0,Great color but ordered a size 10 and it is much looser than I expected. The shirt is nice though but try air drying this instead of throwing in the dryer to preserve the fabric. Looks great with dark jeans and can be dressed up with accesories or wear with a short for casual look.
4.0,Good design. Does look better online.
4.0,Help you breathe more comfortable wearing a mask
4.0,"These are definitely a great value for money pair of sunglasses and I used them for a long time just around the yard and such.<br />I did have a few problems with them though as the lens was easily scratched on them and the polarization was as strong as hoped, but for the money I shouldn’t be complaining!<br />They provide good comfort, never irritating my ears and are stylish!<br />I would recommend these to anyone, just be careful with them!"
4.0,"My measurements: 5’4”, 38DD, 190lbs<br /><br />I am so happy with how this dress looks! I’ll probably order more in other colors. The dress fit perfectly, is a little flowy but not so much so that it looks like a sack. If you want it more loose, size up, but I don’t think that’ll be super necessary. For my short babes, be prepared to wear heels or figure out a way to tie this dress. I wanted to figure out how to tie it on the side but because it has side slits and a rounded hem I can’t really figure out a cute way to do so yet. Overall, love this dress, great for summer, and from what I can tell it’s pretty good quality too!"
4.0,"somewhat large ,not stretchy ,"
4.0,Awesome and fun gift!<br />T-shirt has great quality!<br /> We love it! Fits perfectly for your favorite  Peaky Blinder.<br />Thanks for making a great T-shirt!
4.0,"Nice necklace, longer than I thought it would be."
4.0,Ordered 1 size larger and it was a perfect fit. Looks very nice seems to be made of good material. Dried while hanging over the shower curtain overnight.
4.0,Fantastic dress for the price.
4.0,"Purchased this for my cousin’s homecoming dance. I was a little skeptical that it maybe wouldn’t fit too well or look how we would expect, because of the price, but we loved it and she looked stunning in it. Very pleased!"
4.0,I gave it four stars because you have to slid open the face and press a button to get the time. The sliding face sticks a little bit and pressing the button makes it a tad irksome to just look at the time but nothing too serious. I would recommend it just for looks and not practicality. But the theme makes a super cool gift for any L fan.
4.0,"Pretty snug on the Jawbone Up24 but it works, and helps keep the wristband secured.  Not particularly exciting or anything, it can be a little difficult to get on the first time on your own one handed so it helps to have a second set of hands to help."
4.0,"Great bracelet, a little more lightweight and cheaper than I was expecting but would still buy again."
4.0,The earrings are beautiful  but the backing  fell off on one very unhappy with the backing
4.0,"I love the exterior of this bag.  It has the appearance of a much more expensive item.  Zippers and hardware are solid and well-made, as is the longer strap attachment.  The zipper across the top is great for added security, and the exterior zippered storage pockets are handy too.  The one drawback is the lining on the inside feels cheap and more like a synthetic material.  However, for the price, this bag exceeded my expectations."
4.0,Works well. Bottom a bit fragile and starts ripping fast.
4.0,I wanted the color to be more plum and it’s more red than plum
4.0,Excellent quality although too thick and hot to wear in summer
4.0,"This is a very beautiful dress, but the flap for the corset is narrow so you don’t have a lot of breathing room for the corset.  I would size up."
4.0,"it was too big, i had to return it."
4.0,"I'm confused. These are sunglasses, not shoes."
4.0,I'm probably a little smaller than their normal market so they bunch just a little at the knees but I love the fit!!
4.0,"I love the fabric, but had to return because it wasn't right for my body type. If you're a pear or apple, I wouldn't recommend. If you look like the model, this is a GREAT dress. Very comfy and flowy."
4.0,Great dress but its running little bit big - im usually size M but this time i had to get smaller size . Otherwise its really nice
4.0,"The gymnast flipped is easy to see and is very pretty.  The standing gymnast is harder to tell what it is, so not as appealing.  Both are made well and are very shiny, and a good price."
4.0,"I have to say - for the price of these glasses -- are you kidding? They are GREAT - I bought 4 pairs after my 1st. Ok they are not the best quality - but for the price and look - the are fantastic. Ony suggestion for fit.. bend them slightly from both sides inward -- they are a bit straight across the face otherwise.  I live in Palm Beach, FL and I have received so many complements on the design by strangers,  I love them -- they are fun. Dont expect outrageous quality for the price -- but YES -- worth the few bucks -- ENJOY"
4.0,Super cute and great size!
4.0,Soft and good material but shrunk one size after washing. For that reason I usually buy 2 sizes bigger for my child.
4.0,"They fit perfectly, wash easily."
4.0,I like the watch and it seems to be made of quality materials. Stainless steel case and waterproof to 50 meters. My only problem is the watch is much larger than I expected. It is about the size of a men's large watch.
4.0,My only complaint is that the sunglasses are a little big for my head.  Look great.
4.0,Very sexy dress .have to have the body for it
4.0,"If it hadn't been for previous post review I would have been disappointed. While the title does says sweatshirt, it is very thin. As it is a hoodie, that should be only in the title description. Picture quality was good, size and  material was as expected. Child loved it."
4.0,Love it cant wait to give it to my granddaughter.
4.0,These fit a bit snug but I feel the more they are worn the better they will fit. It is a strip of  soft plastic with fur attached. Doesn’t breathe very well.
4.0,bought for a costume. item as described
4.0,"Women's Premium Winter Colorful Casual Cotton Crew Socks are comfortable. I needed socks to wear daily in my work, these are not too thick or thin, just enough to be comfortable.<br /><br />The material is soft and stretches well.<br /><br /> I am wearing 8.5 shoes, they fit perfectly.  they are for  Women's U.S.SHOE SIZE 6-9.<br /><br />They come mid-calf(I am 5'7&#34;) and they are good with boots too<br /><br />I have washed them and they haven't shrunk either.<br /><br />It is good quality cotton socks."
4.0,"I didn't get this, but I got instead a glow in the dark locket. I love it and it's beautiful and not what I expected haha just wasn't what it says it is."
4.0,"Got these with another set I found and it was perfect. Super comfortable, soft and cozy. The only issue is that they are pretty thin, both the pants and shirt. I personally love the thinness but others may be looking for a thinker set."
4.0,The band that came with the Iwatch was causing a rash on my wrist. Got this and no more itchy wrist.
4.0,good quality but way too big. im 5 ft 6 and about 125 lbs. should have gone with a small. this shirt is way too long.
4.0,Cleans very well !
4.0,"This is a really nice swimsuit and looks expensive, yet was a super reasonable price.  My only complaint is the way the straps attach is very precarious...it can pop out of the hook loop VERY easily, so I ended up sewing/tacking the hook to the loop so it wouldn't come out while I was snorkeling.  Definitely did not trust it to stay in place in the ocean waves if it could just slip out trying it on in my house."
4.0,"Not much spray for the cost, but functionally excellent."
4.0,"Nice feel, soft & very pretty. Run small. Not as long as I thought they would be but they will work for wearing with a flannel or button-up shirt. The green tank in the picture is pretty, but in reality it is a dull blue-gray color ☹️ Wish it looked more like the color in the picture."
4.0,"Bought a size small for my 12 year old who is 4ft 7in and wears a Justice size 10R. The crotch is very short even for a child. The is sold as adult size, but I'm not sure how it would come up high enough to cover anything on an adult. It does fit her and cover her bottom and we will order another one for our other young daughter. However, I would not order one for an adult."
4.0,I returned. It wasn’t bad. the fit just wasn’t great and didn’t really compliment my body. I’m 5”5 147 ordered a large and it fit but like I said it didn’t make me feel butterflies in my stomach when I looked in the mirror so I returned it.
4.0,I give this a 4 because  I gave this as a gift the first night my friend worn it some of the stained fell out really disappointed. Nice looking if it did not fall apart
4.0,"Super stretchy material, runs very large and long, would recommend a smaller size if ordering- very nice color & dress otherwise"
4.0,"The watch looks good and is of better quality then I was expecting. The insert to make it look busy is a little cheesy, it would have been better with nothing and just show the gears. Overall great purchase, especially for the price."
4.0,"It wasnt as sparkly as I had hoped and the stem is somewhat big.<br />Overall, its a pretty product and doesnt rust or anything."
4.0,"I love the sun, but it doesn’t love me back, I guess. If I’m in it for more than a few minutes, without covering myself, I get pretty sick. These hats are perfect for providing just the right amount of shade for me. They are very lightweight, comfortable, and cool. I would buy them again."
4.0,I would give it 5 stars but it fits much smaller than other large size scrub tops. I was able to still wear it but didn't have as much room to move as I would like to have had. That being said it's a great top. Very cute! I got compliments from co-workers and patients.
4.0,I'm usually a small even though I'm a little chunk around the stomach.  Small was to tight medium Was a tad big but not noticeable . But I loved it
4.0,"Nice business looking new watch purchase the black on black, not too heavy very nice watch will purchase other colors"
4.0,"When I first picked these up, I was worried that they'd truly color everything super pink, but to be honest: the view from inside the glasses is just sort of a rosy-tone - not as pink as the lenses would belie.<br /><br />Nice fit...though pretty inexpensive plastic on the frames...probably wont be able to take too much abuse.<br />For the price - these are OK sunglasses"
4.0,"The look and feel of the shorts was good; however, as a Clydesdale, the fit was a little too small for my taste.  I returned them and purchased a different brand."
4.0,The colors are very pretty but there smaller than I thought but I kept them and will use them
4.0,very cute but the bottom half gets a lot of static easily so constantly sticks to me
4.0,"These socks are soft and slightly thick, probably best suited for spring/fall. However, they are a bit slippery for less confident walkers, so use on carpet until kiddo is very good walker."
4.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend. After he washed it, it didn't fit. He loved it while it lasted! Now it belongs to me!"
4.0,Very pretty but I thought too light for the charms I purchased.
4.0,Loved kt just wished skirt was little tighter.
4.0,I really liked this dress. Very comfortable and nice fabric but it definitely runs small. I had to size up 1 size.
4.0,"They're not a perfect fit, but the comfort out way the one bad."
4.0,Took WAY too long to get here. Quality is good though.
4.0,Great jacket. A bit large.
4.0,These are a bargain and allow me to identify my equipment without having to open each item. I would like it if they were just a little bigger and the ring could be a little more substantial but those are my preferences and not flaws with the product. A very good bargain.
4.0,"I gave the 4 stars only because I wish they where a little bit bigger, other than that, they Arrived early and are cute :)"
4.0,Very small and compact. The magnet is very strong. Good product
4.0,Very soft fabric pretty wine color
4.0,"Halloween costume but I had to alter it, because I could not button it. I am top heavy due to bra size 38D. I did not want it be be too big in the shoulders or too long it the sleeves. I know would have to alter it. But it was a great item."
4.0,bought this for a woman with some mobility issues.  Easy care and does not wrinkle easily
4.0,"Feels nice. I like the size, not too big, not too small.  The opening is a bit small but not too bad."
4.0,"These arm warmers are good, but they start to pill after a while."
4.0,"This sweater is a very nice, mid-weight.  Can be dressed up or dressed down with jeans.  Very good quality."
4.0,I love that for the first time I’ve bought a pair of pants that I didn’t have to hem them!<br />FTR: I’m 5’5 and 170lbs and these pants fit perfectly!<br />Not too long.<br />Not too sheer.<br />Just right!<br /><br />BUT!  If you are expecting linen.<br />Forget it.<br />These are not linen.<br />They are a blend.<br />I’ve lots of items similar to this blend.  It leans more towards a cotton fabric loom than linen.<br />They wash easily in a sink if needed and dry by morning.<br />You can sweat and they dry quickly.<br />BUT they are not 100% linen.
4.0,The magnet works really well and they fit together well. The paint is a little cheap looking.
4.0,"This bag is awesome! I love the colors and the fact that it has lots of pockets for all my stuff. The only thing I don't really like is it has way too much drawstring. Why does it have so much drawstring?!! I don't know what to do with all that drawstring! That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. **update - Here's my picture, look at that extra drawstring! It's unnecessary. **<br />I still love the bag though. I would buy it again."
4.0,"This is heavier, thicker, and bigger than a normal dog tag (see pictures). The metal feels thick, solid, and high quality. The cord is a little disappointing, though. It's smooth and the knots slip around so the necklace loosens easily. I tightened the knots as much as I could and I think that will help, but I wish the cord were a little higher quality. My son is having a Zelda party and he'll love this, probably as a toy more than to wear around his neck, so I think it will be perfect for what I need. If you're looking to wear it, know that it's pretty heavy and the cord isn't the best quality. You could easily replace the cord, though. And the Sheikah slate part of it looks awesome."
4.0,"Great T-Shirt, it was a great Christmas gift.<br /><br />I't would seem they print the shirt after you order it, so the t-shirt takes a bit to ship out."
4.0,The face is a little bit bigger than I realized. But it is great
4.0,"Nice fit, fast shipping, good price,  why else do we shop Amazon! Buy it"
4.0,These are a nice pair of breeches for the price. The reinforced seat is a definite plus against wear and the fabric is soft and thick. I didn’t give these breeches 5 stars because the ankles Velcro across making them a little bulky under boots and the knee patches are just a thicker fabric instead of the usual  suede patch.
4.0,"Fits great and is beautiful! The only issue I had with it is that the belt was too small. I ordered a 3XL and have a 44.5 inch waist. Other than that, it's a great dress."
4.0,Great fit. Would've given it 5 stars but the belt was too short
4.0,The magnetic band looks nice but gets hair caught at times and can loosen when exercising. The pins take some time to get to used to when trying to install the bands. Linked band works well.
4.0,"I am 5'8 and 225 lbs, I ordered a 2x, I was looking for a tighter & heavier spandex. Not what this is. They were comfortable in the hip/butt and loose on the waist. I took in the waist myself. The bants are long enough and comfortable."
4.0,"When I first pulled these on, I thought they would be too small - they were awfully snug. But they stretch a bit to fit your calves (really comfortable, I forgot I was wearing them) and the snugness means they don't slide down in your boots. I wore them out to a girl's night and got a lot of compliments. We walked a fair bit and they didn't budge at all. They are cute, and they fit well. I've tried them on 2 different boots so far and they worked great on both.<br /><br />* I received these for evaluation and review"
4.0,Theses are so cool! Love ll the colors to match outfits! Great value for the money :}
4.0,"It is a cute necklace for a science nerd and looks more elegant than just getting something like a double helix, but I thought it would look nicer in real life."
4.0,The mother-in-law (in her 90's) was remarking that her hands were always cold. I ordered this product for her. She likes how soft this product is and that it keeps her hands warm.
4.0,Got this shipped early and it is a bit smaller then the picture but one thing is that if you don't want the studs come off make sure super glue it around the studs and the other thing is that if does not fit into your lobe bend the back part up. Otherwise cute product. Dainty
4.0,Casual dressing
4.0,"HUGE is what I would say. After having surgery, I waited too long to return them, so Amazon said no. I then received an email from Pajama Jeans who said they would exchange them for me and did. I received them two days ago and didn't even try them on as I could tell they would fit. Unfortunately, after the first wash, the rivets on two of the pockets are ready to rip, and I haven't even worn them yet! Just a fluke I'm sure, but will get a coupe of wears out of them. I do thank Pajama Jeans for volunteering to exchange them."
4.0,It's super cute and comfy.  But the tassels are closer to pompoms than tassels.  Still ... cute casual dress.
4.0,"Fit is perfect.<br />Sun block is exactly what I like.<br />The overall size is much better than another pair I use because these have a smaller profile.<br />The case, cleaning cloth and the pouch is a plus."
4.0,Cool print. Good quality. Tried a couple sizes and they tend to run large for the stated fit.
4.0,My wife loves it but is extremeny small remember you get what you pay for.and at this price you do get a little more'''''' great gift
4.0,It's a very pretty dress with good quality i would say that the only downside is that it runs a little big so when ordering go down a size unless you like baggy sleeves and bust area
4.0,"Very cute dress. The neckline is a little funky to get situated at first. Overall it is a nice dress, not too thin."
4.0,"I like, I thought the would be bigger, maybe its just my face. hahah"
4.0,"The box state that it was a blue color, inside was grey. But it was nice too"
4.0,"These ear grips are very helpful at keeping my glasses from slipping and sliding.  They are slightly uncomfortable, but the benefits far outweigh that."
4.0,Gave as a gift. Fit perfect and very comfortable.
4.0,Only gave 4 stars because it’s far too big for newborn. But now that it fits (with a little rolling of the pants legs) it is just as adorable as I hoped.
4.0,"These Charms are very cute... I need them for earrings, and they are not enough pairs , I have about 5 single colors that they are not pairs. Reason for 3 stars, One came damaged :( I don't want to send them back just for one piece that is damaged."
4.0,"I’m a female, about 5’4” and 120 pounds, small-chested, with a slender but athletic build, and typically wear a size small. My “recommended size” (based on previous apparel purchases) was a medium; I got the large hoping for more of an oversized look. It actually fits me perfectly (body length, sleeve length, shoulder room, etc) but not in the way I hoped to achieve lol; I think I’d probably have to go up two more sizes to achieve an oversized look.<br /><br />The material wasn’t what I was expecting; it’s definitely not a cotton feel and is pretty thick. I’m sure it’d keep me warm, but again, not what I was hoping for.<br /><br />I ordered the white; I had a pink ombré sports bra on when I tried it on, and it showed through the material. This kind of shocked me because, like I said, the material is pretty thick. Figured it’d be worth noting, though.<br /><br />The zipper on the side is super cute and actually what got me to buy this.<br /><br />I’ll be returning mine, but only because I don’t prefer it - not due to a lack in quality or anything. Could be great for someone else, just not me! 😃"
4.0,I like the top but is a bit snug at the waist line.
4.0,They're just so small.
4.0,Bought an XL and it fit very nicely. Definitely would buy another one
4.0,"I love these pants. Bought them in all patterns. Nice to wear to yoga and around the house, even after sweating, the material seems to wick nicely, so you don't feel it. Only downside, they are extremely long. I'm 5' 7&#34; and these run an extra 4&#34; long at least. Not a problem for yoga, just need to be mindful if jumping, not to step on them and fall over. Could be hemmed if necessary"
4.0,Nice warm slip on's. I also like the durable  sole. I can wear these around outside.
4.0,Fit is perfect to size. Thought the color was black but I like the gray. Very satisfied
4.0,Nice product. Runs small.
4.0,Not my style but I starting to like it
4.0,I bought an XXL and should have got an XL. My bad. Also the skin tone color is more of a peach color instead of beige.
4.0,Obviously I just got this so I can't rate this on durability but it is a decent very low-cost no-frills money clip
4.0,"I have a daughter who is EXTREMELY picky about how her clothes feel. This dress is lightweight and has no seams across the body. My daughter loves it, and it first her well. My one complaint is that the material is so thin that she will have to wear a training bra with the dress. We haven't had this issue with any other clothing yet."
4.0,Have gotten a compliment every time it’s been worn.
4.0,"Nice material, nice length so I don't have to worry about it showing my underwear, but as I pull it up my waist,its a wee bit loose. Around my hips though, it's not. I got a medium, and I'm glad I did though so I can wear it both ways. I worry that the small would be too snug or too short for my long torso. I'm about 5'7&#34; and wear about a size 5pant."
4.0,Easier on-off. To me it feels like less compression. I just will need to wear them a while and see.
4.0,"This coat fits small, so definitely size up. I regularly wear a L/XL, ordered a XXL, and it is still small by my shoulders and arms. Just take care to size up if ordering. Also, the craftsmanship is not perfect. From reading other reviews, I think I lucked out a bit as the button holes and pockets on mine are all sewn well, but the lining in the sleeves is awful. It is ill-sewn and unraveling and hangs down past the sleeve, so it is visible by my hands. The lining is also loose in other places inside the coat. I'll try to fix it myself, but the exterior of the coat looks good, and it is definitely warm enough for late fall, early winter weather."
4.0,Great price. Nice Quality.  These are thin chains about 1 mm. but you do get three of them.  I would recommend. I also purchased a 3mm one.
4.0,"The waist/chest area isn't proportionate to the skinny sleeves. My arms were a bit tight in the small, though I'd need an extra small for an appropriate fit elsewhere. I'm about 5'3&#34;, 100 lbs, 24&#34; waist and I usually wear an XS/XXS in women's or L/XL in girls. It just seemed that for someone that filled out the dress, the sleeves would be uncomfortably tight.<br /><br />It was well made and seems durable- though not much elastic in the waist, the navy color leans more toward purple than blue, and lengthwise, it hits the top of my knee. Also be aware that the pockets are just like in the picture- they're not the type of pockets you'd keep your hands in when relaxed, although they are actually a decent size. Since it was a bit large, it wasn't the most flattering on a slim body type.<br /><br />It's a great dress, how pleased you are with it just depends on body type, and preferred fit, as well as attitude and expectations. Keep in mind that it ships through the mail... so of course it might come out wrinkly! There isn't a tag or label in the back of the dress, but there is one sewn into the seam on the inside of the dress- if you cut it out and throw it away, you've lost all the fabric and washing information."
4.0,This is just so adorable and perfect for summer! I love the color purple and I like butterflies so it's a perfect combination. Super cute & super comfy!
4.0,"No me gusta mucho, pensé qu era de mejor calidad"
4.0,"I got this as a gift for a friend and he loved it. This watch strap is of great quality for the price. However, the color is a little brighter than what you see in the picture."
4.0,Nice dress with a beautiful pattern but too small. I even ordered up 2 sizes. Plus the cut of the top of the dress was off.
4.0,I wish they were just a tad bit longer in the waist. - material is very nice and light enough so it doesn’t feel like a “full sweater”
4.0,Great product! Made great gifts and still had enough for myself. Saw some very similar at my favorite boutique but these were a better value!
4.0,Nice quality but I like sweatshirts a little roomier. Returned for a large
4.0,This is not the necklace I received....the beads on the shorter chain has beads on a straight bar rather than on a curved. Do not like that part but the necklace is very pretty and fairly good quality.  Would buy from this seller again. Thanks
4.0,This is a very flattering and feminine dress.  I love how I feel in it and my boyfriend loves it!
4.0,Loved it. But it only lasted six months before the band frayed and I had to throw it away.
4.0,Decent fit/stretch. Lightweight
4.0,Ordered large after reading the reviews and the fit was spot on. Returned it because the photo showed a red and white dress but it is actually pink. Since colors are listed by a letter and number there was no way of knowing I was not getting a red dress.
4.0,Completely love the design the sturdiness the shine durability just slightly big and you have to adjust from moving  Around.
4.0,"It’s very gorgeous cute. But the only thing is that the price ...., which is little more expensive."
4.0,Like the abalone; I like the natural materials used for this pin. This pin is just the right size. It is very pretty and I get compliments whenever I wear it.
4.0,"This top is a bit more see through than I thought, but it's really cute, cool and best of all, it has pockets!!"
4.0,Straps were too long. But otherwise it was great quality for the price.
4.0,"I love these, the reason i gave them 4 stars is because they fit a little tight. But i have only worn them once so i'm sure they will loosen a little.I am a curvy girl, and these really slim me in all the right places. I am going to get them in other colors now!"
4.0,"The skirts are a good fit and very comfortable to wear.  However, the fabric was a bit thinner than I expected it to be.  Still not a bad buy and I'd purchase them again.  I'm anxious to see how well the fabric color holds up after repeated laundering."
4.0,"The wallet is really pretty from the outside, but once you open the wallet up most of the compartments are plain old cheap. I advice you to buy it for someone who rarely uses a wallet."
4.0,"This necklace is an almost perfect outfit completer. I chose white and the stone goes with most everything. There is a nice tonal variation in the stone I received; enough to give it interest when looking at it closely. The color of the chain is off so it definitely looks like fake gold. I've said this before, but I wish fashion jewelry would use stainless steel instead since it is a better metal and it doesn't change color like other cheaper metals can. I'd gladly pay a little more for stainless. I grab for this necklace several times a week so I would buy it again. I like it so much that I added the black one to my wish list."
4.0,For the price the dress fit pretty cute . I bought a small in the waist was a bit roomy could have been a little bit smaller but because I have 36 D boobs an extra small would not fit me up top .
4.0,Cute suit but the top definitely runs small. I'm glad I went up a size.
4.0,Excellent feel and comfort though it was slightly LARGE in the heel. I just stuffed a sock as a filler. The leather laces do seem to come undone rather often but then again I walk to the store in them. Good option for camping too
4.0,"It's pretty pricey for one nose ring but I've had mine for awhile and it hasn't fallen out yet. The ones for hot topic are good, but I always seem to lose them. This ones going strong! I like it"
4.0,Was very large compared to other size shoes in the same &#34;size&#34;. But once her foot fit into it they worked great.
4.0,Long enough to cover all the girly bits with a tunic.
4.0,"Nice wig, a little snug for an adult."
4.0,These are good for a costume. They are pretty thick and bulky in your mouth.
4.0,"This is such a pretty fabric, soft, silky and with a little stretch. The length on me, (5'4"") is a little long, hits right below my ankle so I have a habit of lifting the hem, but it's not bad or dragging on the floor.<br />The wrap and tie waist gives me the option to draw the eye up, which is good for me!<br />Very happy with the price and quality of this dress!"
4.0,A little longer than I thought but looks really cute on and fits just right
4.0,"Definitely worth the money, a must have as the hat that came with the tux was non-usable. Not a high quality item, but looked great."
4.0,Wonder feel/texture
4.0,"Beautiful hats, so sad my 2 month old can’t wear it 😩I was looking forward to match with her."
4.0,These glasses are nice but easily scratched.
4.0,"I was looking for a simple dress for a wedding. It worked out very well. The dress was formal enough, yet comfortable."
4.0,"Very tiny wallet. I don't carry a lot of cards, so it just barely shuts. If I were to have anymore, though, it wouldn't shut. I don't recommend if you have more than 1 credit card. Great quality, beautiful colors."
4.0,"The color and the design are cute. For the quality, you get what you pay for."
4.0,UPDATE! Loved if so much I ordered a second for my nephew! He loved it! He’s 9<br /><br />Definitely worth it! I like to hike and would normally put my wireless headphones under my beanie but they’d normally bulk up around my ears and add a little extra pressure so not totally comfortable which is why this is a great buy for me. I don’t have to worry about grabbing a beanie AND headphones just grab this and go. It’s good for travel too since you can just fall asleep and hear music or whatever you have playing. You can also wear it without the headphones and wash the beanie alone. If this had a little hole for a ponytail it’d be everything a girl could dream of.
4.0,nice sling bag...wish it was a bit bigger...but made well and will work for what we need it for.
4.0,This suit was very tight but the bra size was perfect.  I was afraid that if I ordered a bigger size the bra part would be to big so I just returned it.
4.0,"These are so cute!!  They are a little small, but still wearable.  By the end of the day my toes feel smooshed.  I still wear them but I take them off as soon as I get home.  I would buy them again IF they came in a size larger."
4.0,Finish is pretty nice but not perfect. There are not enough spacers to securely hold my watch in the Winder so made a strap to go around the cushion in the watch. Also a couple of LEDs inside would be nice for solar powered pieces.
4.0,Great shorts for the trim fit!
4.0,There are beautiful but not like the images
4.0,"Arrived on time, as described."
4.0,Good quality! Super cute and big!
4.0,It's a great going out outfit but not the best quality. I'd still recommend it. Just showed too much side boob for me and was a little scratchy on the skin.
4.0,Good luggage tag
4.0,I loved this hat. It served it’s purpose by protecting me from the cicadas. Thx
4.0,"Nice, but a lot smaller then I thought they would be."
4.0,Looks cute .. Kinda a bit big on me (125 llbs and 5'4&#34;) Should have gotten a small instead of a medium. I wear with a jacket to help with the bigness..
4.0,"I loved the angled edges on the frame! It was more unique than a regular pair of aviators. The frames are really flat, so it does not give me the best solar coverage when it is really bright outside. Definitely more of a “fashion” sunglasses."
4.0,Bought this to go in husband's large bi-fold wallet.  Nice.
4.0,Cute bags. Love these
4.0,"This dress is a decent material but not a true to size XL. I would need a 1x for it to fit comfortably & not be so tight around the belly area.<br />Otherwise, it’s a great print & material for office or casual wear. Definitely light & airy."
4.0,"It's not as heavy as I had hoped, but it is a nice hoodie none the less.  I would buy it again"
4.0,"Very light Navy blue.. wish it was darker, but I love the fit and design!"
4.0,The outfit is adorable and I have a tiny problem but it's not going to stop my daughter from wearing it. The flowers on the antlers on the pants are different color than the shirt.
4.0,"Order a size larger than expected, and you should be fine. I'm going to order another for my oldest daughter."
4.0,Bought as a gift. She seemed to really like them.  They are very light and a little fragile.  But overall very nice quality
4.0,"Comfortable, love the bling!"
4.0,Love this dress! Fits great and very flattering! I'm 5'3 and 153lbs. I got a medium
4.0,"Dress was sewed weird at one of the side seems near under arms and puckered a little in that area. Fit accurately. Loved the material fabric, as it had a little bit of stretch and layed nicely when worn. Was a heavier material. The short to long style was really fun and cool to wear. Looks like a more expensive dress when worn. Bought red color and has a great true red vibrancy."
4.0,This is a nice fitting dress and it looks nice but the material is very light. I can see through it. I gave it 4 stars because of the material. But the fabric is veryyy soft and comfortable. Hugs my body in all the right places.
4.0,Love it! Wish it was silver.
4.0,Does the job. Be careful to not scratch expensive bracelets.
4.0,Love the colors and design however do beware the head opening is a bit snug on my 2 year old.
4.0,Not hard to use and clean
4.0,I absolutely love these scarfs. They allow my natural hair to breath really good at night
4.0,This i bought around 4 month ago but one of the filters fell off in the streets.and I could not find it so I bought another one because I like the fit.
4.0,This dress is very comfortable. It was just a little too big but it works.
4.0,"Absolutely amazing belt, I've at one point owned one from WWE and it wasn't as good as what I received from this company. Thick heavy plates, probably weighing over 10lbs, I was pretty impressed for the price. I recommend it ALL day. Details on plates were good, I love that the little guys wrestling are actually etched into the plates and not separate pieces that can fall off like the one you would get from WWE. Plus they sent me 2 nameplates that they didn't have to do. I love everything about it."
4.0,Very beautiful but the head band was slightly broken
4.0,Very nice bracelet...wish it wasnt as lighter.
4.0,For the price it's a great piece. I've gotten many compliments when I wear it. It's a great fit for any size wrist since it easily opens up.
4.0,Great zipper item and quality.  It fits very nicely on a purse or backpack and does not break with daily wear.
4.0,"Soft, strong, nice design, holes were relatively small and i needed to force the guitar parts through it but all in all i like it"
4.0,I love this small purse. Wish there was at least one pocket outside.
4.0,We had about 8 or 9 that needed to be pinched on the sides to come on. I think it's just that the tiny wires get loose. They are still a great bargain and we will buy them again. They are awesome for nighttime Easter Egg Hunt!
4.0,"Works just like it appears to from the pictures, keeps cables organized and flattened for ease of use in a backpack or similar sized bag"
4.0,Bigger in person but still cute for the money & came quick too!
4.0,"I'm a big guy, kinda tight"
4.0,Great looking on the wife
4.0,"They shipped quickly and they were exactly what i expected. It's just the white is not white, it's like a tan!"
4.0,"I did not receive this purse, due to its becoming unavailable. However, I have seen it in a store. It is lovely. It is ample for everything I carry. The reason for the 4 stars is due to the fact that I really wanted this purse. It is a bit tight to carry a 45 in it, which makes it hard to remove, so I carry a 380 in it with no bulging."
4.0,Runs small but over all can't beat the price.
4.0,I love this little charm! Very delicate.
4.0,These little earrings have blue pearls my granddaughter wanted blue pearls I purchased them for her I receive them the color is beautifully done in blue.
4.0,I like it would like to get a next one
4.0,Wear 'em everyday.  Functional and versatile.  A must have!
4.0,"Super cute. The top fit well, but the bottom was like an extra small. I'm usually a small so I bought a medium and it was no where near fitting. I returned this swimsuit."
4.0,Good quality but shipped very slowly. Missed our event.
4.0,Good comfortable shoes.
4.0,Cute colors but they are pretty tight. My babe has smaller calves and they still leave the design print on her legs if worn too long.
4.0,"The product (photo journalist vest) is very useful and durable. I wear the vest to work and get all sorts of complements. The pockets are large enough to house my PDA, stethoscope, pens, etc. I would highly recommend and rate the product 4/5 stars.<br />Brian Vaughan, Los Angeles"
4.0,Just got them but they appear to be just as advertised
4.0,"For the price these shades make you look ultra cool, I feel like Michael Jackson in the 80s 8)"
4.0,The picture doesnt make them look as sheer as the webs are but it is nice overall and very stretchy and warm in the dress part. Probably could have sized down one
4.0,I am not being paid or compensated in any way for this review. I did follow the instructions and ordered one size up so I ordered an extra large we're typically I would be a large to extra large I have a long torso 38 inch around bust with d to a double D cup. If it's wonderfully my boyfriend loves to see me wearing it but it is too short to wear out as a dress. I am 5 7 but I have short legs and a long torso. It looks great to walk around the beach with but other than that it comes up to about an inch past my crotch and my rear end. If I walk extremely careful I could wear it as a dress but definitely could not sit down. I washed it and hung it to dry and it still fits exactly the same. Extremely comfortable and extremely flattering. If it were two to three inches longer I would have rated it 5 stars.
4.0,They work very well and are waterproof as stated. I can't wait to try them snowboarding
4.0,OK for the money
4.0,Bra is too small panties fit
4.0,"It's  ok..<br />It looks cheap, couldn't  give this as a gift."
4.0,I wear this dress for casual occasions and fits nice.
4.0,"Work like they're supposed to and good quality for the price. I read several recommendations about sizing up one and I definitely do not recommend doing that. Wish id ordered my normal size as its a bit of a pain to get them on when theyre a bit too big.  Other than that very satisfied. Have no belly, small waist and a big booty and thick thighs if that helps."
4.0,great boxers
4.0,"This dress is great and comfortable, but I may have bought the wrong size, since the empire-style waist makes everything balloon around me and I look like I gained 20 lbs when I put it on."
4.0,"A very decent house slipper! It is very comfortable during colder months of the year but, can be a bit warm for the hotter months of the year."
4.0,"bordering on too tacky of a gold color. im not sure if i have big ear lobes, but i did not find these super long like other reviewers. they are uncomfortable to lay down in, as they smash into the side of my head. still, i'd say they were a good price for the cost."
4.0,"It was a beautiful bracelet, but we had to return it as it was too small.  My boyfriend is about 210 and he needed an extra 1/2 inch at least on this bracelet.  Just check your man's wrist before ordering."
4.0,"Purchased this tote in the wine color - absolutely stunning deep red.<br /><br />PROS: Height, width and depth of tote is perfect.  I can fit file folders, wallet and still have room to spare.  The zipper pocket in the middle is great for stowing away items you don't need at a moments notice.  The straps are easy to adjust and fit comfortably on my shoulder.  The straps support the weight very well.<br /><br />CONS: The only bad thing is the smell from the leather when you first get it.  It has a chemical smell that takes a couple of days to to away.<br /><br />Overall, I like this bag."
4.0,Really like the look and feel. I would say otder a size up. Really recommend!
4.0,runs a little longer then expected
4.0,"Cute lightweight hat, comes with a strap if you have need it. It’s easy to fold up and throw in a bag."
4.0,They were exactly the way they describe them except for I felt like they were too thick for me.
4.0,"I am excited to use those. The caps were loose , but I was lucky that they didn’t leak!"
4.0,I like the stylish design. I can tell there is clear difference with it or without it. I feel much comfortable when I wear it in a sunny day.
4.0,It was ok but quality is a bit poor
4.0,They are quite heavy but beautiful.
4.0,These are a good ring.  I only mark them down because the smaller size is of little use for much.  Its hard to twist enough to screw in the connector.  The connectors are a little disappointing as many holes in product aren't big enough the accept the connector through it.
4.0,Beautiful for any occasions
4.0,I really liked these but they could be a bit more breathable and soft. That's what separates them from a higher priced garment like UA.
4.0,Looks better in person. Bought for a girly and Would order another pair for my daughter  but they’re not in stock.
4.0,"Bad is nice, fits watch perfectly.  It draws more attention than I am used to or like.  The colors are very bright"
4.0,The pants are way to long. Otherwise they are loose in all the right places.  A reinforced butt and knees would have been nice. It's a nice pair of pants though.<br /><br />The delivery was so fast that it surprised even them.
4.0,Love the dress. Fit is great and meets my expectations. Good quality.
4.0,"I bought this watch to wear while my good watch is being repaired.  I am really pleased with my purchase, it was delivered on time and fits my small wrist.  The watch has a small piece of plastic around the crown which you remove to start the battery.  Nice little watch."
4.0,Super soft and comfortable!!  Runs a bit big and sleeves are real long.  The pocket riped just after a week of waring it. :(.  Other then then that it's a awesome sweatshirt
4.0,"Looks and fits exactly like the picture. The color did fade after a few washes, still wearable tho. Fabric is thinner than I’d like. Solid purchase."
4.0,Shirt fits well and is super comfy.
4.0,"Shirts are nice, but they are a bit longer than I thought they would be. I thought they would have shrank in the wash some, but they did not. I still wear them, but I can only do it while wearing pants. I am 6 feet tall and they feel almost like a dress on me."
4.0,"This is a very nice, decent umbrella,  Large enough that you can use for two under neath and large enough to cover on those super rainy days. While i do like this umbrella it's a tad to big for me. It's not so much bulky but its very long. Defiantly not an every day when it rains type of umbrella. And for sure not an umbrella you want to give a child for them to use.<br /><br />I got this item at a discount to try and give my honest opinion and review."
4.0,"who'd have likes them  bit bigger, but hard to find XXL gloves these days, so you can also use liners anthem for added warmth."
4.0,I really like the pendant but the necklace it comes on is just kind of mediocre and it broke on me just removing it from the package. I will be switching it to one of my plain chains but for the price I'd still call it a good buy.
4.0,"I loved this! I’m 200 lbs, 5’3 38D & I ordered an XL I can’t wait to wear it to this wedding in April. I just wore this to my jobs dinner dance (cocktail attire). I plan to buy this again a different color for another wedding!"
4.0,These looked great.  They did irritate my nose after having them on a couple hours.
4.0,wonderful workout tanks
4.0,I will have to lose a pound or too. I can wear it but it is a bit too tight around my middle. It is a beautiful top. You might want to order a size larger.
4.0,"They stay on. They're thinner fabric, so they are not my go-to for cold weather, but they do just fine the rest of the time. One of my shoes makes a farty sound when I wear these, so I just don't wear them with those shoes."
4.0,I love this dress  it looks amazing the only problem is I can't tell which is the back side and the front side also is a bit short so don't  put it on a windy day
4.0,"I bought this for my husband last Christmas, he LOVES it!!  He can finally listen to his death metal while he cooks and I can still be undisturbed in other parts of the house."
4.0,Took this on vacation and recived tons of compliments on it...sooooo comfortable. I gave four stats because i had to fix it to lay correct manu times during the day.
4.0,Bought these for my grandson and he was excited when he gotten them.  Tried them on and loved them but was disappointed that they shrunk when they were washed.  Amazon has great customer service and they are replacing them but got a size larger so that when they shrink they will fit.  Gave it 4 stars because there was no indication in the packaging about them shrinking when washed if not I would have bought a larger size.
4.0,Nice scarf! It sheds easily... even after you wash it! Don't wear a white shirt with it. Lesson learned!
4.0,They came vacuum sealed so when I first opened them I thought “they got me f’d up” but after putting them in hot water they returned to a perfect circle and they fit my kids noses.. I can’t wait to see them in their costumes.. P.S. I minus a star for scaring me 🤷🏽‍♀️😂😂😂
4.0,"I love these sunglasses!  They look super cute, fit well, & block the sun fairly decently.  I have a problem w/sunglasses hurting the side of my head right above my ears or hurting my ears.  These don't do any of that.  I have a collection of sunglasses & these are my go to pair every time.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that they've been dropped a few times & occasionally a lens will pop out.  Thankfully it pops back in place w/o any difficulty."
4.0,"They're soft and comfy, but the fur tends to slowly shed away."
4.0,The material is  water resistant But as far as the sides I would go up one size other than that everything was great
4.0,I like the product because you can't always find a hat in size that you in that color you want. With this product you can change the size to one that fit your needs.
4.0,The ring was lovely and the opal was stunning.  My only regret was it had the prongs and not bevelled.
4.0,"The glases has very poor quality and are too wide and short, so don't fit well, the rest is fine, my son loves it"
4.0,"The gaiter mask is good, what I needed especially for traveling with mask under it.<br />It is much thinner than I thought it would be.  Also, It feels like 100% polyester.  The label says 55% cotton, 45% polyester.  If there is cotton, it's definitely not 55%."
4.0,"Sometimes when you buy sweaters on Amazon you are not sure of the quality.  This one did not disappoint.  It is not flimsy, washes well, colors are bright and is comfortable to wear.  Happy with my purchase."
4.0,Were gifts for members. They liked them a lot. Good quality work.
4.0,"I love this outfit, the only complaint is that the adustable part at bib is WAY WAY too long. Since it is adjustable, it does not need to be so long"
4.0,"I had my doubts but the shirts fit as expected, nice & neat too not to mention shipping almost felt instantaneous. No complaints here, great product will by again."
4.0,Amazon your great for my needs thanks!!
4.0,I like it!!very much!!I do recomend!!!
4.0,"I like that the permanently affixed cover won't get lost, and neither will the tiles--but that also means it's impossible to shake the tiles quietly. Worse, the &#34;Boggle&#34; name imprinted on the plastic makes it hard to see all the tiles. Still, it's well priced and easy to take along."
4.0,"I usually wear a size 2-4 so I thought a 6 would be a safe, comfy fit when I ordered this top previously in the purple. It runs a little small!! So I ordered up in this color at a size 8. It was still very fitted, so keep that in mind when ordering.  It still offers great coverage and overall I am satisfied with this product."
4.0,A bit tight in the waist.  Otherwise just fine.  A good buy.
4.0,"Super cute dress! I'm 5'9&quot; (36C, 28&quot; waist, 42&quot; hip), and I ordered the large. While the bust is a little large (I have to buy based on my hips), it is still a great fit overall! If the dress had some snaps to keep the wrap together, below the waist, I would have given it 5 stars, but it can fly wide open. To avoid giving anyone an accidental peep show, I used a couple saftey pins to hold the wrap in place."
4.0,"Very soft, stretchy, good quality material.  I returned item because it ran a bit large and the arms were a little tight.  If it weren't for the arms being tight I would have just exchanged for a smaller size."
4.0,"A little small for size, but stretchy.  We will see what happens when they are washed!"
4.0,I ordered two sizes up. I normally like to wear and XL for lounge pants. And these are so comfortable!!!! I love them for lounging or wearing them out for a shopping day. The only complaint I have is the waist band. Was expecting a wide waistband like yoga pants. It is not! It's a small elastic band in wide band of cloth.
4.0,Sleeves were pretty baggy. Other than that product as described.
4.0,"A bit big for my petite 5 yr old, however they do have adjustable straps so we made it work! Print quality is reflected in the price but made it through an entire school year and still in good condition."
4.0,Beautiful dress but DOES RUN SMALL. I’m an 8 and I rarely have issues with size but the M 8-10 was way too small and I’m closer to a 6 than a 10. But return was easy and I ordered the next size up and love it
4.0,"These are super comfortable gloves that fit great and work with my phone.  I like that they are snug, but not too tight, and they flex nicely.  But I got them for driving--not for cold-weather texting--and they're perfect for it.  My only disappointment was that they aren't as warm as I'd hoped they would be.  The lining is a bit thin."
4.0,"Fit is perfect, it's just a little bit too long, or maybe I'm too short. Still cute though."
4.0,"I sized down from a medium to small, fits well 39” chest.  Glad to have a choice of colors besides the typical black grey & navy.  No logos or other free advertising. Surely I’m lifting more weight too in this tank."
4.0,Very pretty but I was expecting something smaller. From far away it looks like a little surfboard. Still like it though
4.0,I like it. Especially since I have been working in the medical field for years.
4.0,"Got these because they're little dachshunds! Cute jammies, just wish the shirt was a little bit bigger/looser fit and the material was at least a cotton blend but can't really complain much. Super comfy."
4.0,"A bit baggy under the arms, but soo cute!"
4.0,Very cute but it is a bit short for me (not long enough for me to comfortably sit down).
4.0,"Very nice shirt, although the color is more of a pink than a red. It fits well and is comfortable. If the color was represented better it would have gotten 5 stars."
4.0,I like it but the shorts are too big.Would like to exchange for a small
4.0,Cute earrings.  About what I expected for the price tag. Not the highest quality but very cute.
4.0,"The colors and designs are super cute. They are a good size, just right for a tube of chapstick. I would definitely recommend!"
4.0,At the time I purchased the shirt they only had a medium but I got it anyway as I'm a big fan of the series. The shirt is exactly as pictured it looks very nice. If you're a fan go on and treat yourself.
4.0,"i bought this as a gift. my friend loved it, the only issue was a black fleck on the surface of the moon earring.  likely something embedded in the resin since it couldn't be wiped off. the fleck is big enough to notice at first glance and it blocks out some of the image. other than that little fluke, the earrings are very nice, not super heavy, and just as easy to put in as other screw-on back earrings."
4.0,These are nicely made and perfect size
4.0,"The quality is good, and the item looks exactly how it is pictured. The minor issue is that it looks too small (almost inconspicuous) when attached to a BMW key fob!"
4.0,I love this but the small is a bit too big it fits me more like a medium.. it’s super cute tho just wish it was bit tighter
4.0,"I got the XL and it barely fit in the shoulders.  Runs a bit small.  Nice looking otherwise, though!"
4.0,I like these durags they do their job I like how you can wash them and they still stay silky
4.0,Beautiful colors.  I wore it to my grandson's wedding and it was perfect.
4.0,"Really cute necklace, I just wish it would have been smaller. Lots of compliments."
4.0,Nice little watch great price. Use it for work so I don’t worry about scratching or other abuses. Amazon rocks never an issue with service.
4.0,"Extremely well made in every way. More then worth the money. However, they were a bit heavy and slid off my twists. I made it work with other means, just a bit inconvenient. Couldn’t imagine the weight on a beard honestly but I’m a girl so what do I know lol"
4.0,I have a little belly. Love how it's high waisted.
4.0,It's shorter than I would like but very comfy
4.0,"I bought this necklace to wear to my graduation! As a Barbadian living abroad, it's really nice to have a little piece of your country hanging around your neck. The necklace is stainless steel with gold coating and 'BARBADOS' written on the middle of the piece. I wish they offered it without the font on it, simply because I think the pendant does more for itself without the country's name written over it rather simply.<br /> I also wasn't expecting this pendant to be so big! The chain itself isn't the nicest design wise as well. Nonetheless, I really like this necklace; it says everything about me and I've been wearing it since it came. Regardless of the design flaws I would buy again! Going to tell my friends about this necklace!"
4.0,"This is a very pretty pendant, well made, with plenty of sparkle. The center stone really catches and reflects the light. The chain is very thin, so I put my own chain on it and it fits better.<br />I'm very pleased with this little cutie."
4.0,"Fit as expected, material is thin.  Makes for a great costume.  This is the second one I've purchased."
4.0,Little large but as pictured for most part an great quakity for cheap
4.0,Nice pants for the price but they do fall down at the waist.
4.0,"Really cool shirt, very fun pattern. I bought this for my Mexico trip and it looked great. Thin enough material to allow you to stay cool without jeopardizing quality."
4.0,It fits a little narrow across the shoulders.
4.0,"This is adorable! It's starting to wear down a bit now after a few months. I tugged the strap one day and it snapped off, and the gold paint is chipping. I'll definitely buy again though! The little puffball is holding up strong even after getting wet a few times"
4.0,"don't always work well, but they're cheap and they do what they're supposed to do."
4.0,"Actually, I love them, but they can be a little tricky to put on, so I gave them a 4-star rating.  I wear them ALL THE TIME.  They go with everything, they're comfortable and haven't irritated my very sensitive ears.  Even Himself noticed them -- something that RARELY happens around here!  ;-p  They arrived promptly and well-packaged, so I'll be looking for more goodies from Bling Jewelry!  :)"
4.0,This little bracelet is adorable! I love the pink stones. It arrived as advertised and intact. I have a young friend who is just going to LOVE it!! It IS on the small side so I would not get it if you have large wrists. I got this for a 9 year old. I will update this review once I hear back how it fit her. I think it will. And if it does not then it is worth keeping to grow into some day.
4.0,Beautiful dress however it is very large in the chest area. If you aren’t large busted then it might be a tad too loose in the chest.
4.0,"Runs a little small, launders well."
4.0,The color was just a little different then pictured but still a cute shirt
4.0,I've had these for a month and loved them until the button on the fly tore off. I have two other pairs and the button stitching seems flimsy. Otherwise these are great shorts.
4.0,"My state recently went ""green"" and now charges for plastic and paper bags. Reusable totes fit nicely in my handbag for use when I go shopping for small groceries or other items. Price was right.  Easy to fold up."
4.0,"like it very much, especially the case it came in!"
4.0,a little small for me....
4.0,"The jeans were great, my 11yo loves them, but they were just a tad short…which worked out since that’s the look she likes."
4.0,"Great dress. Love the material, but it runs large. Will purchase another. Many compliments 😍."
4.0,"These are great, comfy, a little tight to out on"
4.0,"These are smaller than anticipated. I got these for my septum piercing. I ordered this same size from another seller and it was bigger and fit, but these didn't (I ordered 16 gauge, 1/4 in or 6mm)I don't know which seller was correct in their sizing. It'll fit for other piercings though."
4.0,"L fits great around my ribs, but my D's hopelessly push through the caging on the bust. Which is exactly what I was going for. Wish the cuos were a smidgeon larger, but that's not the makers fault."
4.0,Runs big. I had gotten the small and fits like a medium/large. If they had an X-small would fit better. It’s a loose fit not a curve fitting t-shirt.
4.0,Work great for my costume
4.0,"This is the watch my husband prefers and has been purchasing for years.  It's digital, easy to use and change time, it gives him the date.....the other functions are a bonus!"
4.0,"I used these for my daughters one year pictures, worked great!"
4.0,I needed a new wallet and this seemed like a good deal. It looked too big when I first got it but i got use to it and now I love it
4.0,"This sweatsuit is super comfortable. Thanks to all of the previous reviews,  I went with a medium and glad I did. It still was more fitted than a typical sweatsuit (which is what I wanted), but not tight. If you want a loose fit definitely size up at least one size, if not two.<br /><br />Update: I went to put the pants on and realized the pants don't have pockets. I like to wear the pieces separate at times, so this is a bummer."
4.0,"This Phumee blouse is made of a cotton-polyester fabric that is very soft feeling and comfortable to wear. The eyelet is a lovely design, and perfect for warm weather due to the eyelet holes. I bought the fuchsia color, but I would call it a dusty rose, in small. I am 5’5” 135 lbs. It drapes nicely and looks good. This blouse will look great with jeans or black pants. It can be dressed up or down. I think it will look lovely in white. When I shot a close up to show the eyelet pattern, the color seemed to wash out and turn brownish. This photo is not representative of the actual color, just the pattern. A very nice top for the price."
4.0,Good keychain the person I got it for likes it.  However its hard to slide keys on to the keyring
4.0,"They are hypo allergenic and they we're really cute, but the problem for me was they kept falling off but other then that perfect, just had to tighten them just a Tad (Oh and yes you can bend the cartilage part to your size 😊)"
4.0,"5’3” and 150lbs. Got a large, fits roomy but cute. Thicker material."
4.0,"These are nice for the money.  They aren't the same design all of the way through, so that looks a little weird on some styles.  And they are heavier than expected.  Nice earrings overall."
4.0,"I am always losing my sunglasses, so I tend to gravitate towards cheaper ones in general. For me, function is more important than looks. In a nutshell, these are very, very lightweight, block out the light, and they stay on my face even on a hot, sweaty hike. I like these. They are great value for the price."
4.0,These are awesome for the price. I only gave 4 stars because after a little bit of time the coating on the front of the lense started to fray.
4.0,"I am usually a xs, s, 115 lbs, 5&#34;2'. I ordered a Medium and glad I did, it's vibrant and comparable to Yumi Kim's silk romper although the quality is awful,really awful and really just meant to wear once, seams we're opening and threads were popping. I felt awesome wearing it but most likely won't wear again..on and shipping was ridiculously long."
4.0,"Just got this in the mail and as per all the other reviews, it does run INCREDIBLY small and I got the XL, and I'm glad I did as I almost went for the Large. Normally I'm very comfortable in Medium/M Gap denim jackets with room to layer underneath and the XL ZAN.STYLE Moto Jacket is VERY fitted. It's not so tight in the arms that I'm crying when lifting my arms, but it is quite fitted, borderline tight around the armpits. Just be aware of that. This jacket must be a combination of Asian sizing and juniors sizing, but unlike some brands where you just size up one, this is two, even three. This XL will be a joke to some in terms of fit compared to XL sizing of some American brands.<br /><br />I'd dare say the XL here is equivalent to a size Small moto jacket I have from Forever21 that fits snug in the arms. I'll be keeping the jacket as I really wanted a powder blue-something or other, as the tightness is manageable for me over a sleeveless shirt or dress and I believe the quality is decent for the price. I usually never spend above $20 for a good quality Gap jacket or something from Macy's or JCP. For some reason I thought the jacket would be bluer in real life, but it leans quite gray IRL.<br /><br />Took some photos around sunset on a gray futon but I did try to color correct a bit without it being too drastic to help represent the color. The blue is very muted, like a muted ice gray blue, would definitely be considered a neutral in a wardrobe. I was considering some other similarly colored blue jackets from Target and elsewhere (including one from Member's Only on Amazon) but opted for this one because I loved the style, it's timeless. And although the edges are raw, they looked neater and more polished than some other designs I've seen and I liked the cut and fit more than some other boxier styles. My only real gripes are the misleading sizing and some sloppy construction on the under side of the belt strap, but I can forgive it as most people won't notice that and it's not on the outside of the belt. I love the bright chrome hardware and the metal zipper seems to be of good quality. Overall it looks more expensive than it is and I was happy to pay more for a jacket in this color."
4.0,"Great leggings, not see through, not too thin."
4.0,"Just received my order. Was a little upset because I expected it to be Navy and white. However, the rem of the hat is black and the anchor part is navy blue. I do like the way it fits and that it's adjustable. Besides being my expectations being to high, I would say I love the hat."
4.0,"I purchased a Prism jacket 4 years ago.  As advertised, it is a very versatile jacket.  I live in Idaho, where it can be cold, but often times any more a lot of warm winter temperatures.  It's very warm for it's weight. It blocks the wind well, which keeps you warm. (I've purchased some down jackets in the past, which were warm, until you got in the wind.) It has a stiff, but flexible brim which is great.  In the rain or a heavy wet snow it will  eventually absorb the water, but I don't think I've been wet inside.  Finally it gave way to a split zipper, and I finally ordered a new one.  I would give the old jacket 5 stars, but the new one only 4 because the material which is supposed to be an improved version of Pertex, but it just seems too thin or light.  Maybe it will hold up, I'll see, but it doesn't seem quite as rugged as the old model."
4.0,I love the way these hug my body and they're really comfortable.
4.0,A nice scarf but does lose fibers on whatever you are wearing. It is pretty and dresses up my winter wear.
4.0,It look so real but if you have it in to long it starts to hurt
4.0,Very nice but TOO small.
4.0,For a $10 you can beat it! You get what you pay for. I drop these so many times I lost count. Lenses are scratched up and the legs of the sunglasses are loose but again there cheap sunglasses ( $10 ) I'm not going to pay a ridiculous price for some nice looking shades. When these look good to me. Love the blue! Need to order some new ones.
4.0,Just as expected. Made a great gift for a teenage girl.
4.0,I am 5’7” 130lb and I ordered a medium. Great material and very cute. It comes above my ankles. I almost would like a large better because it isn’t stretchy at all.
4.0,"These jeans are so comfortable and the high waist band is perfect to add control to your belly.  If you have an upper muffin, sometimes the waist band will flip over."
4.0,Nice looking...fairly priced.
4.0,Very comfortable although the padding is a bit thin....but overall I like them.
4.0,really worth the money
4.0,"These are great cleaning gloves. They run a bit small, but not too bad. Easy to clean and have a little loop so you can hang them up to dry. I don't need a sponge or cloth when I use these to wash my bathroom sink and wall tiles. It does a great job."
4.0,"I bought two packs of these for a European trip with my daughter. I loved them.  Light weight, easy to see through, kept all our items sorted and easy to find in our Rick Steves back packs.  I've continued to use them for several years now.  One of the zipper pulls came off, but it has not kept me from using it."
4.0,"Definitely defines style, a little short on quality, and the reasonable price reflects that."
4.0,Comfortable for lounging
4.0,"Eventhough it's a cheap watch, it comes with a nice looking  box.  I think this is the main benefits buying cheap watch from amazon, because it comes with the original box.  Every movement is precise , very nice looking watch for the price. However, the downside is that safety buckle part seems to be cheaply made and little weak.,other than that, I am loving with this watch."
4.0,Great material not to tight (I'm not a skinny jeans fan) I love these jeans.
4.0,"The bag is adorable but I'm not sure if its actually genuine leather.  Either way, its a cute bag for the price."
4.0,"I have a 39"" waist and it fit good. Ibought a similiar one in black and I keeping that one to wear with a 50's style swing dress with crillion and I returned the white one just because the black one looked better."
4.0,That side zipper made this great but could use a couple of extra zippered pockets.
4.0,"One of my favorite amazon purchases.  Compact, has a sweet slot for bills in the middle.  Is very tight when you first get it which leads you to believe it may not be the right one for you.  However it loosens up a bit with use and fits what I need it to.  If you need to carry more then this then you are not a minimalist wallet kind of person.  I will buy again."
4.0,"Cute top but tight around arms and chest, while loose around mid section. Size small was too tight to be comfortable (5'5"";,117 lbs) for me."
4.0,If you have wide feet don't waste your money.  I ended up having to give mine away to my dad and he LOVES them.  I wish they offered wide sizes because these sandals were really nice  Leather is very soft and my dad says they are very comfortable.
4.0,My daughter is on the small side. It fit in all places expect the straps made it big for her.
4.0,"Then mask and shield are nice but.... I received the wrong color ending up with army green camouflage instead of the red camouflage. Was very disappointed, I was soooo looking forward for red camouflage mask and shield."
4.0,I love everything about this shirt other than the fact that it says dry clean. I washed it on delicate by itself and let it air dry and that works.
4.0,"I love this pendant tray. 4 stars because a few were broken and it looks like some were overfilled in the mold,I had to break some metal off a bunch of them."
4.0,It’s super cute but definitely short. Had to wear shorts underneath in order to make sure I wasn’t going to flash anyone. Love the pattern and style - just wish it was a few more inches longer.
4.0,Very long & big
4.0,"Awesome purchase ,beautiful dress"
4.0,Beautiful ring and stone 🥰 very happy 😍
4.0,"I wish it was a little sturdier, but the floppiness is nice when you're trying to over-fill it and the price was great!"
4.0,"Tiny pendant! Fortunately I often wear big necklaces, so I can wear it at the same time."
4.0,"These run a full size small.  I am normally a medium (5'3&#34; 138lb) but they were SKIN TIGHT, like beyond what was comfortable.  So I gave them to a small friend and they fit her great.  I ordered the large and I am pleased with the material.  They are a little longer than I hoped because it is a large, but worth the price for an undershirt if you order up a size."
4.0,Great for kids at school
4.0,About an inch little longer than necessary. Wedge shape (narrow at bottom with triangle-shaped ends) not apparent in photo is not as good as rectangular shape. Cleaning cloths inside just get in the way of glasses and zippers; I'm going to cut them out. Padding is good and two color zipper pulls are a benefit. Would be nice to have an ID pocket on outside instead of belt loops. Quality leather and nice red color.
4.0,comfy and true to size
4.0,"For the price, this is an excellent buy. Buying one size up makes it a perfect fit (it is quite long, so may need some adjustment). This was used as a bridesmaids dress, and it stood up to other dresses that had cost hundreds. The ruching on the waist was not neatly pleated, but this was remedied by attaching a large strip of silk ribbon. If planning to use this for a summer weddding, be aware that the underskirt is quite thick and heavy, causing legs to sweat considerably."
4.0,good compression
4.0,Roof motorhome
4.0,"Used these for a team game at a family reunion.  They were a little tight for some of the male adults but worked perfect for all the kids and teens.  Arrived early, held the iron on logos well, held color when we did a pre-wash.  Colors are very similar to pictures with the exception of the lime green and red.  The red was mistaken once or twice for pink if not next to the pink and the lime green was confused for a shade of yellow by most."
4.0,These were ok.  Not as good as Under Armour but 1/2 the price too.  Runs very small just like everyone already said.
4.0,"I thought these might be weird with the elastic on the back, but the fit is fine. They are really comfortable. The length is good, too."
4.0,"The dress itself is nice. I got compliments on it until after sitting for an hour the dress seam ripped in the back and my butt was showing. I was at a convention so i had to hide in the bathroom until someone found a sewing kit to sew it up. I am not a big woman either. I am about  5'5, 160lbs my measurements are 36-28-42. I have hips and a butt but still should not have busted through the dress. I really want to order it again and maybe go larger but then the top will be even bigger and it won't look right."
4.0,"As a watch collector, I am constantly in search of the unique and unusual.  The watch MUST speak to me and lure me to investigate its more interesting qualities.  The Hot Iron Man watch did exactly that!  The display is ultra retro...I really like it.<br /><br />Although originally somewhat skeptical, I was pleasantly surprised with the construction and design.  Amazingly inexpensive.  It arrived fairly quickly after placing the order and was packaged in a mailer, with the watch surrounded by a reasonable amount of bubble wrap.  The product ships from China...really!!  The watch came with zero instructions, warranty, etc. All that being said, I'm very pleased thus far."
4.0,Cute but overpriced.  It's rainbow quality with a TJ Maxx price.  Cute but thin
4.0,very nice dress but pretty tight I recommend ordering a size bigger than you wear. But nice material and love the color.
4.0,I generally wear a xl but reviews said these run big and they were out of xl so I went with the large I should have just went with a xxl  and tucked it in I like loose fitting shirts anyway.  the quality of the shirt looks good and the shirt doesn't feel like some thin piece of crap like so many shirts out there. I will see if the seller will trade it for one I can wear.
4.0,"Very lovely, it is gorgeous"
4.0,Ordered xl runs a size smaller fits more like a large ordering a size up is a good idea really cute but had to wash when I got it smelled really bad... Just for reference I'm 5'7 170 lbs hour glass shape xl is more fitted to my body but not to small
4.0,Husband uses them in house. Does not get around well. Easy for him to put on
4.0,More of a choker. I thought it would be a little looser.
4.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet if you like tiger eye - attaching to your wrist is a little awkward but once you settle it in, it fits nicely"
4.0,Nice. Exactly like the picture. Little tight on hips I'm 42&#34; but it's ok. Recommend.
4.0,Very nice.  It's a gift for an opal birthstone sister.  Thank you for the box.
4.0,Stretches out but overall a solid ring to wear.
4.0,It’s great to the size .<br />  Nice material for the summer .
4.0,"Great hoody for the gym, I like to workout in a hoody or sweatshirt, this is the best I have found yet.<br />The vents in the back keep me from getting over heated!<br />True to size, and it is a great quality product."
4.0,Feels too heavy to be ti. Works well though.
4.0,"I love this pendant so much. It's a really good size and seems to be of decent quality. I like the stiff wire of the necklace and the coating hasn't flaked off yet. I don't know where people get off calling the size small or child size. I'm a bigger girl with a shorter neck and I wouldn't even call it a choker. It does sit up higher than the ""standard"" necklace but I wouldn't call it small.<br />This clasp though..... This clasp is another story. Open and close that's all a clasp needs to do besides not fall apart. This however is a sunken screw together style that I am not here for. THIS is where the ""small"" size of the necklace does come in to play. The clasp is teeny and hard to match up when you can't see what you are doing. And then you have to twist. And twist. And twist. And twist. And twist. And twist some more before you can finally stop and declare the jewelry donned. Open and close, this clasp is over thinking it. So minus one star because the screw clasp pisses me off.<br />9/10 would recommend for any Fairy Tail guild member."
4.0,I got this dress for work and it is great.  I had to get  2 sizes above my size but it fits perfect.  It is stretchy so it hugs you on am the right places.  If you don't want to clingy then go up 3 sizes.
4.0,Only problem is that the persol code PO3129S means they are polarized. Mine are not.
4.0,"I want a larger size than the XL, Would like size 1X......."
4.0,We like them a little to large but that was on me. But nice.
4.0,"The patches and embroiderey are awesome, just like the picture. But the jacket itself is a bit small,  ordered womens xl and its more like a womens medium. The sleeves are really short. Love it enough to keep it and i dont think they make ot larger, but be aware that it definitely runs small."
4.0,"This is more a collared sweatshirt than a jacket. The terry part of this is the inner side of the fabric, which has a terry weave similar to what's often seen in towels or socks, but with shorter loops, not loose. Outside it looks like other sweatshirts do.<br /><br />The inside of sweatshirts is usually just brushed to make it soft. Terry is a more substantial fabric. It's heavier and absorbs more moisture, so this may be a little warmer than most sweatshirts (though brushed fabric insulates well) and it should absorb sweat better.<br /><br />The plenty-big hand pockets have two layers of that same fabric between your hands and the outside, so they're warmer than usual too.<br /><br />The zippers are plastic with metal pulls, operate smoothly.<br /><br />These are the measurements for the size L I got:<br /><br />Shoulders: 19""<br />Chest: 46-1/2""<br />Waist: 43-1/2""<br />Bottom: 42-1/2"", stretches out to same as waist<br />Front length (from top of shoulder): 28""<br />Sleeves: 27""<br />Sleeve openings: 7-1/2"" and stretchy for more<br /><br />Those are fairly typical for a large except for the waist, which is a couple inches smaller than usual, but this is stretchy fabric widthwise. The sleeves are maybe a bit on the long side, but most hands will stop them from slipping down too far.<br /><br />Machine wash cold with like colors with zippers closed, non-chlorine bleach if needed, tumble dry low heat, cool iron, no dry clean.<br /><br />Made in Cambodia."
4.0,"The first time I took off the lenses to put on the polarized ones, I felt that I cracked something, and I believe that the little pin that keeps the lenses tight lost it’s ability to lock in place. Sometimes (almost always) when I manipulate them, it comes loose, however the lenses don’t fall off. It’s annoying anyways for this having happened the first time I took off the lenses"
4.0,I love some of my sampeel tops. This one with ribbing was not my favorite. Still good quality.
4.0,I am a size 12/14 and i ordered an XXL ...it was way too small. It wouldnt even fit my 12 year old daughter. I got ot on but the shoulders were so tight it instantly ripped the cheap silk liner. The only good thing is the sellers were easy to work with.....thats the only reason for the 4 stars
4.0,"As always, you cannot go wrong with Serengeti glasses.<br />The only &#34;negative&#34; if any, is the size of the frame, width, which could be another half inch for my head."
4.0,great price son loves them could fit alittle better in dirt bike helmet though
4.0,Smaller than I thought and strap is too short to carry over the shoulder. Only reason I returned it.
4.0,Worked great for our photoshoot!
4.0,The dress is beautiful! I wish the skirt was a little bit more full like the picture. I purchased a petticoat to make the dress look fuller.
4.0,"Fills great, looks cute.  But little to big.  I ordered size M.  I wish I  ordered a size S."
4.0,I like the sweatshirt but the zipper is hard to zip up and down.  I wouldn't purchase again.
4.0,Price was good and it is a cute product
4.0,"It’s a very cute dress. Fabric is soft and the back is stretchy. The length is fairly long (I am 5’1”-ish) so it goes to the middle of my calf, which is not a problem (considering getting it shortened though) Only concern is that the fabric is slightly see through and seems to wrinkle easily."
4.0,"Love it, is was a little small in the bust, I was hanging out of it but looked like Sofia Loren & Vergara my husband was pleased!!!"
4.0,I was expecting it to be a little different than what it is but I do enjoy wearing it it's comfortable I wish that the tie would tie just a little bit better than what it does
4.0,"See through, I just layer it, purchased in pink & yellow"
4.0,really dont stay up ..most likely will not be buying these socks again
4.0,A little tight across the top so not for someone that is big busted but really great for a summer concert outside.  and pockets - always a plus when it has pockets.
4.0,"These bracelets are fun and cute. However, they are not very durable. They also lose the silver color soon and turn bronze color. The delivery time was long, as anticipated. The colors and size are accurate. I would order them for a little girl, not myself. They would make great stocking stuffers or fun little Easter gifts."
4.0,"Fits well and looks good on. I noticed a thread unraveling on the sleeve the first time I wore it, but so far so good."
4.0,Follow the sizing chart provided. It is accurate and fits exactly as pictured on the model.
4.0,I really like this blouse. I'm just a bit disappointed that the blouse is not exactly as pictured. The buttons and the holes are not sewn very well and resulted in that area not lying flat as it should. Otherwise it's a nice top and pretty color. It's still a decent buy for the price.
4.0,Fits well.  I bought it on lightening deal so I'm satisfied with the quality for the price I paid.
4.0,Hard to put rubber bands on for seniors.I cut them at an angle and was much better.
4.0,Si deberían pedir dos o tres tallas más si tienen un poco de bubis más q la foto yo soy mediana y pedí extra larga y me queda un poco justa de las bubis pero de hay en fuera todo bien me gusta
4.0,The description was true and the colors bright
4.0,really like this and arrived early.
4.0,"My sister mentioned that she wanted a new bracelet, she loves it"
4.0,Great but warm
4.0,they seem stiff around ankle area and are a little hard to get on.  I am hoping that they will stretch out.
4.0,"Pretty and looks like a picture, but polyester"
4.0,Comfort level is beyond belief.<br />But the size needs to be smaller than (US xtra small Asain small) for better fit for waist size 28-30 inches.
4.0,Very cute but definitely runs small.  Order 1-2 sizes up depending on how loose you like it.
4.0,These are amazing and I plan on ordering more. They fit just a tad tight but very comfy! I am recommending them to friends!
4.0,I wear this often. I wish the vendors had more color selections in this print. Dress falls beautifully.
4.0,"I used this product to try to block some ""BLUELIGHT"" from my eyes - can't tell if it is actually working"
4.0,"I ordered a Small & this is a good compression shirt, as it fits very snug, but not too tight that it's uncomfortable. The material feels nice, smooth and breathable. It almost feels like a second skin. However, there is just one thing to take into consideration, depending on what size you get, the shirt seems to roll up from the bottom sometimes when moving fast which means I have to stretch the shirt down so it doesn't expose my lower abdomen. To give a better perspective I am 5'8 and weigh 155lbs. But nonetheless this is a solid product at a good price compared to Under Armour or Nike."
4.0,"This is a great tie, especially for the price.  It is a little thinner than expected but still good quality!"
4.0,"Beautiful ring! I ordered a size 6 and I feel like the size runs a bit small. Wish it came in half sizes. The ring is a very good quality, and looks just as nice in person."
4.0,"fun, comfortable socks"
4.0,"Like the Hat, wish it was even more of a lower profile (I have a smaller head) so this fits better then a regular hat but still comes down to my ears.  Hat is well made, comfortable and durable - a great buy."
4.0,Great trench if your looking for the Rob Halford look. A little thin but made well.
4.0,Smaller than expected. Included a strap. Bought for my small 8yo and they were a little too small.
4.0,The black netting at the bottom tore very easily
4.0,"Overall, very happy with this banner. the letters are thick cardstock type glitter paper.  You do have to assemble the sign, which is very easy and took less than 3 min.  I should have checked the size more carefully as I wanted a larger letter banner but it still is great and did the job.  Eye catching for sure"
4.0,"What is good:<br />1. The elastic is pretty good and holds the stuff that goes inside the loop<br />2. Light weight so it doesnt add additional weight to the bag!<br />3. Slim so you are not adding width either!<br /><br />What is not good:<br />1. I put three devices and ran out of space! : Wifi Hotspot, Battery pack, Logitech Clicker!<br />2. Maybe they should redesign the loops as I cant seem to find the optimal space and size to fit each type of device/wire. For e.g. There werent many large loops available to move the power bank to a corner, so had to put it in the middle!<br />3. The corner loops seem to be little loose!<br />4. Couldnt put the adapter cables (for eg DVI to HDMI adapter) thats just 3-4 inches long!"
4.0,"The quality on these pants is excellent as is the design. However, the fit is on the smaller side. I should have ordered an XL even though I am a large in all other pieces."
4.0,These are cute socks.  Not very thick.  More subtle in person than in the picture.
4.0,The gloves were delivered pretty quick which is always good but the sizing is a little weird. The fabric on the finger tips are wide and the pinky finger is long. I'm hoping it won't be too annoying as I have to wear these for 8hrs a day. They say medium but I would consider these large.
4.0,They are a little hard to unhook but the sizes are perfect.
4.0,Bought as a gift for 13 year old. She loves them
4.0,Nice sin glasses work well..my gf like them so as long as she good so am I ..
4.0,These are nice. They fit well and comfortably. They do a nice job of cutting down on the glaring head lights of opposing traffic. I also like to use them when I am reading against white paper or working for long periods of time on my computer.
4.0,I'm 5ft and I'm wide so I definitely need to get this tailored to fit like the photo. It's too long.
4.0,"These are very pretty, shiny, and well made. However, they definitely appear larger on the model’s ears in the photo than they actually are. Other than that they’re great with sturdy backs. I discovered stainless steel jewelry as an alternative to sterling silver awhile back and I never looked back! I prefer it to sterling silver because it’s even less expensive, holds up forever, & never tarnishes! You can shower in stainless steel and wear it daily, and it will never look worn out (provided it’s good quality stainless steel). I’d recommend these, just don’t expect them to look like the model’s earrings in the photo. I wish this seller did a bigger version of these, but I can’t find one."
4.0,Needs clear coat
4.0,"I really like this shirt.  It's comfy, yet looks nicer than a tshirt."
4.0,I loved this blouse but the sewing quality was not good.  It fit perfectly but sadly I had to return it because the sleeve was torn when I opened the bag.  It needed double stitching around the sleeve area.
4.0,"Had to return, didn't have a large enough size for it to fit loosely. Was very nice material especially for hot weather and the length was good."
4.0,Cute cozy and holds up great after washing.
4.0,Im gonna hafta give it to my daughter..a little big for me..would hafta adjust shoulder straps..and what's the use in buying something U hafta to FIX to wear..
4.0,"This is a very sturdy bra.  Since I am a really big chested girl, I have to use 4 or 5 bras to keep from bouncing.  I have never found one that would work by itself.  The less you bounce the less you will lose your breath while working out.  This one along with another bra have become my favorites.  I have to have those two along with 2-3 others in order to work out."
4.0,The gloves fit the bill. Keep my fingers nice and warm. They don't really work that well w/ my iPhone but after a few tries it does let me access the screen while wearing them. If that is the reason for buying these then maybe check out another pair because its not precise enough.
4.0,"This is good looking gym bag with sturdy material and it fits the locker perfectly.  It has only one front pocket that I use for shampoo, soap, and other stuff.  I know the description says it can be used for wet clothes but it is hard to put these in with other stuff.  I guess you can squeeze it in but I just use a plastic bag for these wet clothes.  The separate shoe compartment is pretty big.  The zipper is kind weak but good enough for gym use. I had the bag for a year with no problems.  I just wish it has more pockets."
4.0,LIKED THE PICTURE
4.0,Beautiful. Soft. Delicate. Not for everyday wear. But it's very nice.
4.0,"Worked well. We were careful not to bang them around due to reading a cpl reviews about them breaking easy, but they worked well. They glowed well in the dark and the black lights. They have a fair amount of room to adjust for size of person. They do not light up on the back."
4.0,This is a very cool-looking cape.  Something is slightly amiss with the armholes - I have small arms and it is still very very tight - so it is not ultra comfortable to wear - but it is so darn cute I plan to keep it anyway.
4.0,"Parte de abajo queda bien, el top queda muy ajustado para talla 32DD pero cubre bien. Calidad del top no tan buena y la parte de abajo a veces se nota el forro blanco."
4.0,Needs to be just a tad bigger in the stretch.
4.0,Work well and very well made the lie there is nice and adds a nice touch .comfortable and durable
4.0,"Very soft fabric, the fit is so perfect. If you like the shirts a LITTLE looser you may want to order a size up."
4.0,"The product came 2 weeks before the due date. although,  the material is really thin but looks great on my daughter!"
4.0,Great quality and fit everywhere except for the zipper area. Too baggy and saggy there. Otherwise I would have kept them!
4.0,I SO BEAUTIFUL . GREAT FOR A PRESENT.
4.0,"Good quality, but not the best. Stitching is also good, but not great. Good for gym workout."
4.0,They're a little big and a little awkward but I guess it's just that they're glasses.  I can definitely read with them on but I have had a better pair of multifocal readers.
4.0,"Does the job, will still need sponge for food that is baked on but the gloves are great. Small leak after multiple uses but not a huge deal."
4.0,"It is absolutely gorgeous! It's made of heavy duty material, not thin or cheaply made at all. My son just used it today for his 1 Year Old pictures so I don't yet know how well the cake comes off but I'd say it washes fine. It is cotton looking material so it doesn't just wipe off. I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the color of the suspenders is a little more blue than green in person but not to much that it didn't work for me. It is very hard to find this kind of theme in these colors for a boy and it is such a high quality that I would definitely recommend buying if your theme is &#34;He's A Wild 1&#34; or anything woodsy/tribal. Super, super cute!"
4.0,Good Quality and design!
4.0,"Nice top, good quality, runs a bit smaller than expected."
4.0,"These gloves are really fun... arrived exactly as pictured!  Outer fabric appears to be weather resistant, while the inner fleece lining is soft and cozy.  The gloves are a bit big for my sons hands but the velcro around the wrist lets us use them anyway.  They'll definitely work this season and my fingers are crossed that we can use them next winter as well."
4.0,somewhat large in the breast area (and i'm breastfeeding!) and small in the waist. otherwise really nice looking.
4.0,"These are great at blocking the sun. Excellent polarization. I would give it 5 stars, except that the lenses are a bit thin, so they could be a bit delicate for heavy use. However, I have had no problems with the glasses. For the price, I am extremely satisfied. The seller shipped them very promptly and packaged them well. I would buy these again. I bought them for boating. If I lose them in the drink, I’ll just order them again, instead of crying when I lost my Ray Bans!"
4.0,"These are very comfortable sports bras, especially for the price.  They are easy to put on and remove.  After reading the previous reviews about the pads shifting a bit, the first thing I did was stich the pads in place.  I have worn the bras while jumping on a mini-trampoline and for walking workouts.  So far, no complaints."
4.0,"I absolutely love this little backpack.  It has plenty of space inside to carry everything I need everywhere.  I like the print, I like the orange straps, it looks exactly like the picture.  The only thing I don't like about it is that the patch on the front is a little too precious.  I took it off and of course it ended up with holes where the patch was sewn on.  An easy enough fix for me with a patch I actually like.  The only reason I took a star off is that the fabric with this particular print looks like it gets little runs or snags in it wherever it has been sewn.  It's a black background, but white streaks show up where it has been sewn.  So, not only are there little white areas around the holes where I took the patch off, there are little white holes that show up on the seam lines.  It is pretty minor, but I don't think I would buy this particular print/color again.  However, I would buy this again in a different color.  I cannot get over how many wonderful little pockets are found inside, including a padded separator for a small notebook or iPad.  I took everything out of my other bag and I still have extra room in the pockets inside.  There is also a handy little discrete zipper pocket on the backside of this backpack where a small wallet fits perfectly.  I don't even have to take it off to pay for things since I can just reach behind me and unzip the pocket and grab my wallet.  A perfect little bonus for keeping my wallet safely against my back.  The handles on the top are handy and I love the little tab that keeps them snapped together when you don't need it open.  It is a well-made little backpack and I love it so much I may need to buy another one just to make sure I have one on hand for whenever this one might start wearing out.  That may be a while since the fabric is thick and lovely.<br />Update November 2019: I did indeed buy another backpack. I bought a regular black one and I still love the pieces out of this little pack. My daughter also wanted one and she chose the charcoal gray version. These little bags cannot be beat for usefulness and versatility. We love them!"
4.0,"I like the material. It's soft and lightweight, but not thin. The blue was very nice. My only issue was I ordered a large and should have gotten a medium. The shoulders are too wide. I carry most of my weight in my stomach so being loose around the hips and stomach is good. This is on me. I recently lost 20 lbs. so I'm still figuring out what size to wear. I'm 5'2 1/2"" and 139 lbs. It is comfortable and I got it mostly to wear around the house so I'm keeping it. I may get another in a medium so that maybe I can wear it out and about."
4.0,"I'm pear-shaped and bought a size medium in grey. Fits perfect on top and bottom! The color was much lighter than I thought, though. Would have preferred a darker grey color."
4.0,"Very pretty dress for the money. The lace was nice and the skirt just like pictures. The belt is removable! I bought this to wear to a fall wedding, but the shirt was too long for me (5'4&#34;). Normally wear a 16 in dresses and purchased the XL. It fit well, maybe a little big, but not too bad. I ended up returning since it was too long for me."
4.0,Gauzy and light weight scarf. This thing is crazy big. Complimenting colors that go with many things.  Long enough to be a lightweight blanket on a plane or train when traveling. Lots of volume when wrapped around neck for warmth. Long enough to be a shawl. Easy to compress and pack away if u are clever about it (bring a hair elastic and roll it into a tube shape to be placed at the base of your bag or back pack). Soft material and not scratchy or itchy. Loss of one star only because this thing sheds like crazy. I recommend you launder and hang dry before using.
4.0,"I’m 110 lbs and bought the small. It’s very cute and fits pretty well. As others have noted it does fit very loose at the hips and has large pockets and there is a liner under the dress. The embroidery is perfect and beautiful the colors are so pretty. I do think I will take in the sides and basically remove the pockets so that it fits more nicely.<br /><br />The company should adjust the dress and remove the pockets or just make them smaller - it makes the hip area look huge especially when sitting. I think a lot of people return the item because of that. Luckily I have a sewing machine and can just fold, pin, and take it in. The armpits actually aren’t that baggy but I’m gonna take them in a bit."
4.0,"Was pleasantly surprised by the fabric and overall quality.  Got this with a coupon, did not pay full price. Hubby usually wears a Large but I ordered the XL and it fit him perfectly! Size up!<br />Just didn’t understand what the Rainbow hoodie string was about.  I’ve replaced the rainbow string with a black one and it looks better IMO."
4.0,"Gotta read the description, unlike me. Great fit and nice thin fabric."
4.0,Love this jacket. Gives a little sass to any outfit . Thin see through material.
4.0,These are better for lounging. I wouldn't recommend for excersize but overall I think they're cute and comfy.
4.0,Great for the holidays
4.0,"I really liked this jacket and wanted to keep it. It was well made and looked great, but the sizing was not quite accurate. I bought a 2 xl and it was still too small  So I returned it."
4.0,This is a beautiful bracelet. Had in issue with the charms falling off if it though.
4.0,"Good glasses for what you pay for, very comfy and clear and stylish I should say"
4.0,A bit thin but they fit nice and snug. Not bad for the price
4.0,Cute fit. Sits the right length for petite. Wrinkles and needs ironing
4.0,This product was used for an event requiring African attire.  Perfect for the occasion.
4.0,Given as a gift and well received.  I have a little concern on the sturdiness of the elastic band that holds the beads together.  But the overall appearance is very nice.
4.0,I ordered 2 pairs of shoes from this brand and my comments are the same for both shoes. I wear US 8.5 (39 Eur) and the fit is exact - perhaps a bit too exact! My toes and heel are literally hanging over the ends of the shoe. Cute but these are slightly sticky points for me.<br /><br />UPDATED: I've updated my review from 3 stars to 4 stars because these shoes are extremely comfortable. Feels like walking on a cloud.
4.0,My weight fluctuates quite a bit and I’m usually between a medium or a large. I ordered this in a large and I think it was just a bit too snug and runs a little small. It was super cute and good quality I just didn’t like it on me!
4.0,You can't beat the price and it seems very sturdy. My only complaint is that it doesn't want to stay closed once I get my checkbook in it. I'm hoping it is just due to stiffness since it's new
4.0,bought a different style of same brand and had to return and go up a half size.
4.0,"I gave 4 overall only because not sure how much it may fade, really, really nice, I ordered 2 more"
4.0,Love the design but they were too small and I couldn’t get her normal width foot in easily.
4.0,"its difficult to review this until you have used them for several months to determine if they will hold up, but initially they seem to work as intended"
4.0,"Bought it to go with a neon green rave outfit, but color is more yellow..? Lightweight acrylic with sturdy clasp. Nice that it can be worn multiple ways. Overall will keep bc it was $5 and I can use it with other outfits, but color definitely did not match what was expected"
4.0,For my hair
4.0,Very cute skirt but way way too small!<br />The company did handle the return very well though.
4.0,Cute hats but they are made for a bigger head than I have. The strings to try and make them fit better make them fit awkward. But after about 15 attempts I finally got it to fit good.
4.0,"Quality is very good, but it's not as Heavy. The weight of buckle is less than what the description of item indicates. It's 75 percent of that weight. If that doesn't bother you, than you won't be disappointed with the buckle. For me, I wanted a heavy buckle and when I weighed the buckle and found it's weight less than what was indicated on the product description, I was let down"
4.0,Its thinner and the letterplate is smaller than expected what makes it a bit difficult to put on  especially for a kid but they love them
4.0,I knew from the picture that these were long camis. I can not wear them with pants because they are a bit too long. I can wear them with skirts and just to lounge around the house in. Sizing seems accurate and the =y are relatively comfortable to wear.
4.0,"Very soft, thick fabric.<br />Oversized as shown in photo, but not as short as seen on the model. For reference I am 5'2"" and it reaches down to my thighs, I plan to shorten myself as I love everything about it."
4.0,Very pretty. These look high end. They click closed.  One note- they are too small to use as a helix/cartilage piercing unfortunately.
4.0,It's a gift so I cannot really give a decent review. I tried it on quickly and it fitted snugly. Looks good too though to be honest I wish you weren't able to see the elastic inside the cap. But for the price it's a really good buy.<br /><br />LATER: The recipient was delighted with the cap. Says it fits well and really looks great.
4.0,"Boots look just like the picture. Fit like the should too. A little stiff, but should soften up the more my son wears them."
4.0,Perfectly designed; well-made - the ONLY flaw was that the item I got did NOT have tabs with the black AND gold trim (as shown in the picture) - only had the plain gold coloring....
4.0,it fit like supost to and color was ok wish flet more like animal and better color looking. but will do.came on time and in good boxes.
4.0,YOU'LL NEED A CAMI OR A TANK UNDER THIS ONE.
4.0,"I like it, but order a size up. I thought it would be true to size and it's tight on my boobs. Ordered a medium as a 36 C and I'm pretty sure my boobs are going to break it"
4.0,"I'm 5'4'' 140 lbs. and thought the dress was a little bit short for me, meaning that it didn't come all the way to the floor. But, aside from that, it fits as expected."
4.0,I loved my rings for abt 3 wears..then they change to a rose gold type of color...so it's not bad for the price just try not to get them wet...
4.0,The length is great so is the style.  It's a bit tight in the arm and bust area. You definitely should not raise your hands in this dress due to the tightness.  Otherwise it's beautiful.  Order a size bigger.  I typically wear a medium. The large fits better
4.0,I didn't realize this was like a cheap plastic set for kids when I ordered it. I decided to gift it to a little girl during our event where I was dressed up as Jasmine.
4.0,Not as fitted as I had hoped. Runs a bit big.
4.0,Beautiful earrings. Goes well with any dress
4.0,Great quality and look.  Lenses are Dark!
4.0,"I've had such great luck selecting some really great blouses from Amazon. This one is nice for any casual outing and is perfect for the sunny weather here in the islands. It fits as expected and the material seems nice enough to wash and not worry about it fading. I wore a pair of blue jeans with this and it was just what I needed. It can also be worn with white shorts or white jeans which will change up the entire look. I may have to get another for my mom because she kept eyeing this blouse and commenting on it when I wore it. All in all, this was a winner."
4.0,"Very nice, I gave it a four because it was a little tight for my head.  I altered it  (added more material to it) and it works fine."
4.0,"The package came in nicely. Its design is good, my only concern is, it is relatively thin comparing with all my other leather gloves, and I think it might be less warmer. However, thin has its advantage as well. Overall, I think it is worth of the money."
4.0,Good quality. Stitching the elastic could have been a bit more durable.
4.0,It's really pretty and it's same the picture  l love it
4.0,No complaints. Fits as it should.
4.0,"Got this for the Mrs to use as key chain since her older one the spring broke.  The spring is a little bit strong.  The unit is strong with the exception of the aluminum latch part. It's kind of weak, it can be bendable if you push size way. As just a generate usage, it's not a bad clip."
4.0,Really happy with these. Love the shapes for an extra pop. Pretty colors.
4.0,Nice dress but fabric a little cheap
4.0,Cute. Didn't make my earlobes explode.
4.0,"This is a nice sweater - soft and seems to be decent knit material. However, it does run large and this is not white...more like Ivory."
4.0,It's cute .
4.0,It’s cute. Runs big. Not incredibly soft but soft enough.
4.0,Thought it wasn’t going to be comfortable when I first received it but after using it on a long vacation found it to be not only comfortable but the pockets will hold extra battery and other smalls things you might need.  Keeps your camera out of the way but easy to find.  Only found two problems with it the strap was to long and the padded didn’t stay in place something I worked out.
4.0,A great bracelet that is easily marked and loses its paint design too early
4.0,"Although the pants are very large, there is a drawstring waist which works well. The outfit looks quite nice, the fabric is nice and it's comfortable."
4.0,"Yes, seem well made. I have only worn them once. Also they are comfortable to wear."
4.0,"Received the Joyson handbag a couple of days ago. It’s a nice sized handbag with plenty of room for almost anything. My grandchild loves to stuff things in my purse so I can’t wait to see what she sends home with me this week. The only complaint it’s the smell, but after letting it air out for a couple of days it’s fine."
4.0,"Hat is well made and great value for the price, I love it. Represent my Suzuki pride."
4.0,It was as discribed
4.0,"Flattering fit, nice fabric but haven’t laundered yet so I’m not sure of durability."
4.0,"I wear a size 7.5 so I ordered size 8 since a size 7.5 was not available.  It was way too big.  I reorderd in size 7 and it's still roomy (a little big) for me, but not near as bad as the size 8."
4.0,"Much cuter and better fit than I expected. With a strapless and wedges, it’s adorable and sexy, but still classy. I could see this perhaps being a tad short on women over 5’6”. I’m 5’3”, hourglass, 38C, 42” hips, a bit of a gut, (not major but there!), size 12, 150 lbs."
4.0,Very soft. Not cheap.
4.0,I wear these all the time - my new favorite earrings
4.0,"I bougth them for my wife. They are so nice. I just have a remark, I could see in a specific zone of the belt, a little detachment of the coating."
4.0,Fits nice and form fitting stretchy material I really like it
4.0,"This item looks great! quality, color look same as the picture showed, my Son loved it though, Thank you"
4.0,"It was a little big but it’s okay my baby is going to grow into it, so I’m not worry. Other than that the quality is good. It’s nice and soft. Love the string that you can tie. It’s really cute, I recommended."
4.0,I am a huge Braves fan and this ring set is really cute and looks like it will be very durable.  I wear a 6 and this fits -- loosely-- so it would be nice if there were size options.
4.0,It is the warmest hat I own now.  Expected it to be a little droopier in the back.  But still love it.
4.0,"My plan is to be a plague doctor for Halloween this year, this ought to do the trick on my budget. The leather is much nicer than expected! Head strap assembly was a bit troublesome since the loop was so snug. I wear glasses so the fit is...odd, but it can still sit on my face nonetheless. Nothing a cowl and hood won't fix<br /><br />Only complaints are the beak has a little trouble keeping shape and the ventilation could be better. But altogether a decent plague mask"
4.0,"A little bit cheap feeling and looking.  Some of the pieces have already broken, although she loves whatever she still has as if it was the Hope Diamond."
4.0,"Pretty good, but a little stretched out looking."
4.0,"Looks great! Arrived fast. Does have a scratch on the underside but since it can't be seen while wearing its ok, just made me think it was used."
4.0,Fun and funky to use.  It becomes a magnet for attention right away.  I wish it folds better tho.
4.0,Good for spring & fall
4.0,"great for the price,<br />dogs hate it. could be louder."
4.0,Every thing is great but the necklece because it's 2 small for my neck. Other than that the sharingan piece is great
4.0,Very pretty.  Great idea for teachers.
4.0,"It was beautiful, but a little bit too big for my grand children."
4.0,Soft and comfy to wear also they gave you filter which i really like. thanks
4.0,It was very well
4.0,"Great for the price. I would recommend shoe inserts. I wear a sz 5 but purchased a 5.5 as sometimes 5s are way too snug. I should have bought the 5. I wear these for work all day, but I also sit at a desk for 90% of the day. I have received compliments on them. The only thing I dislike is the tongue  does not stay down."
4.0,"Appears longer & larger, however it only passed my chest area slightly"
4.0,"I got this for my boyfriend and he likes the style of it a lot, but because he is very muscular, the notches in the back come undone when he puts it on and off. It would be better if the straps were adjustable by a buckle instead of a hole and a peg system."
4.0,"I really like the boot cuffs. They are pretty, a good red and comfortable. The only issue is that they fall down over and over again. Planned to buy more colors but I'm not sure now."
4.0,I give this a four because it's loose in the toe area but for the price is great and will do for the beach look I'm going for
4.0,The jacket is well made and fits as expected.
4.0,Love the weight and look of this sweater. Glad I ordered it one size larger  - so it would look big!
4.0,"They are a little larger than the set they replaced, but they work fine in my wallet.  Plus, they don't seem like they will get stiff and brittle like the old ones."
4.0,I wish the knees were more padded! I am going to keep them though because I think they still look great and fit over my regular pants🤷🏾‍♀️ At least there is hip padding
4.0,I liked the fit of it which was as expected. I have a hard time finding tops that fit well and this one fits very well. It is comfy like a sports bra and still cute. It can be difficult to find a swimsuit that fits well and doesn't show too much and this one does the trick!
4.0,"The dress fit decently. 5'5 and 120 pounds, and it came just above my knees."
4.0,"Nice gloves, a little snug for size Large but I'm happy with them."
4.0,Fit was as described. Arrived earlier than quoted.
4.0,"Love this umbrella. Absolutely adorable for kids. I purchased this for my little girl for her Easter basket.<br /><br />This legit came in a HUGE box. I was a little concerned with it being so big, I wasn't sure if she was going to be able to hold it comfortably. It looks a lot bigger when it is not in use. Once you open the umbrella, it looks a lot less intimidating. She absolutely loves it.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the curved handle. Just makes it a little difficult to hold. The price I feel was a little high. I think something like this could easily go for 5 or 6 dollars less."
4.0,Got it for my wife and she wears them around the house with hardwood floors as well
4.0,Great!  They look just like his daddy's name brand ones. Only thing is the ear piece slid off but some super glue fixed the issue.
4.0,Fits perfect to size don't think you add a full cup size.  Did give a little cleavage to a size B
4.0,I really like this long dress--I feel like I can wear it anywhere.  The only problem is that  I'm a little short so have to hem these types of dresses.
4.0,Let’s be clear 1 bow 1 drink 2 pairs of earrings but only one coller when in listing says collers and also you can make this stuff for cheaper please hear my warning and have a good rest of your day
4.0,Loved the material!!
4.0,"It's the right size for the tassel that I'm making.  As a homeschool graduate, school colors were not available in ready-made tassels.  Teal, purple and white were our school colors.  This is going to look GREAT! Graduation Cap Tassel will be 9&#34;  with a 6 1/4&#34; Cord Loop, the loop being done in purple."
4.0,I wish the cape part was just a tick longer.
4.0,child liked it and so did I
4.0,"Cute unstructured style dress for the price.  Took a long time to get it, free shipping....you get it."
4.0,"Size is small, but I've tried two different Pandora-type bracelets and the connector doesn't fit either bracelet.  It will make a cute necklace for a smaller family member."
4.0,Colors not as vibrant as the pic but still nice looking
4.0,"My wife really likes the R1.  She prefers the non-fitted feel of the Mens garment, but they have done a good job of improving this Pull Over since she bought one almost 12yrs. ago."
4.0,My son is over the moon happy with the Spidey designs. The white and gray pairs that have no image or images only on the leg are much softer hence more comfortable to wear. The others are admittedly cool looking but all the screen printing makes for a rough to the touch feel. Washing doesn't help much with that. Does shrink noticeably even on lowest heat setting.
4.0,"Update....without a request the vendor automatically shipped a replacement the next day, before I could return the original set (very impressive customer service, since I usually have to ship items back & then reorder on my own) These are very pretty; as expected but missing 2 stones so exchanging for a pair in better condition... hopefully"
4.0,So warm! My head is too big for most hats so this a bit snug for me but it looks great. The pom pom is a bit too large for my liking but it’s fine. Was almost too warm for 20 degrees and I am always cold. Highly recommend for those enduring those pesky polar vortices.
4.0,They look even better in person. A very elegant look had the buy the Pearl charm
4.0,"Looks beautiful, my best friend loves it!"
4.0,"Long, just small in the arms"
4.0,I put 4 stars just because the shape of it hurts your tongue after a while. Another then that its very cute
4.0,"Nice looking shirt!  I ordered a size up and it fits well.  Sleeves a little long, but still looks good."
4.0,These are great! They wick away sweat and are lightweight. I only gave 4 stars because the headbands tend to slip off of my head when I’m running. They stay put during my other workouts.
4.0,"I really liked the pants, but they were way to long for me. I am 5 feet 5 inches tall. So I don't know if they come in a shorter size. I did return do to the length. Other than that they were good."
4.0,Fits really well. A little bigger in pelvic area than i was hoping for but still fits comfy. The bottoms dont ride up in the back when you walk or move. Overall would recommend and purchase again
4.0,I really like this set. It is incredibly easy to put them in and they look great!
4.0,"Hey..they're compression socks.  I'm not really sure what they do, but I've worn them on a few of my longer runs and mud/adventure races.  They are very durable and give my calves extra support."
4.0,Bought as a gift for the girlfriend and she loved it! the only issue I have is that the chain seemed a little weak for daily wear but otherwise I am very happy with this product.
4.0,"I dig them, so does a few other people"
4.0,love them!! definitely can tell they are cheap so handle carefully. super light weight
4.0,My daughter up Ioves the look of her new necklace.  Unfortunately we will need to add more loops to the chain to obtain the correct fit for her slender neckline.
4.0,The hat was a little large but still a great gift!!
4.0,Perfect for smaller wrists!
4.0,The straps are challenging but other than that it is a great size. Love it!
4.0,"Fit great. The colors are way brighter than the picture.  It didn't think that was possible yet indeed, it is so. The material is sheer. It would make a perfect beach cover up. With a slip, it is long enough for a dress and I am 5ft, 6 inches tall."
4.0,"I am 5'5'' measurements 40-30-38 long torso. Fits great, looks great (I ordered a medium) and the best part is you can't see it, even under form fitting clothes. Sadly the straps cut in by the armpits and it has a tendency to ride up and give you major granny panty lines, maybe it's because my upper body is longer than average. Overall I recommend!"
4.0,"These socks are NOT heated. They are just thick, thermal socks.<br /><br />The socks are so heavy I can’t wear them with my normal boots, they are just that thick and add that much bulk to my feet. But I don’t intend to wear these socks out and about. I like to wear these socks in the house in the fall and winter, they keep my feet warm and cozy.<br /><br />I wear a men’s 7.5 and am easily able to layer a pair of socks underneath these thermal socks. They have a lot of stretch.<br /><br />I do recommend line-drying these socks instead of tossing them in the dryer. It’s a pain, but the socks seem to hold up better. When I put them in the dryer, they are noticeably fuzzy on the outside."
4.0,Bought for my Dad. He loves these! Apparently they are very soft and comfortable.
4.0,"PROS:<br />-These pj’s are adorable- especially the velvety green.<br /><br />-They are great for lounging around the house.<br /><br />-They fit true to size, for the most part.<br /><br />-They are going to keep you warm in the winter.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-The elastic around the waist of the pants is a little snug, but I think it would have been too big if I ordered a size up.<br /><br />-The crotch hangs down somewhat low. It’s slightly uncomfortable, but you don’t really notice it after a few minutes.<br /><br />Overall, I think the pro’s outweigh the con’s. If I had the choice, I would definitely order them again. The lustrous, velvety green is just so hard to pass up!"
4.0,"They are very nice ,just right size would like to know if all metal is sterling as am having some itching when wearing. Otherwise love them"
4.0,It’s good to just throw something on but has not Body shape
4.0,"Good hat, protect from the sun."
4.0,"I thought this was a Jersey material from the photos but it’s more of an opaque gauze-y material. So beware of unavoidable wrinkles. Regardless, it’s super cute and flattering and works for girls with long torsos. Very excited to wear in Tulum."
4.0,Very comfortable however if you have larger calf’s size 🆙
4.0,"Smills bad, but it's pretty"
4.0,It's cute and nice quality. It runs small though I ordered a size 8 but fit it to fit how I want it to I think I'd need a 12. I want it loose. The 8 guys really tight and the lining needs  to be 2 inches longer to cover my stomach. I'm sure a 10 would fit but most likely not as I want it to.
4.0,"not long enough, pretty clors and nice material"
4.0,Pretty sandal. We need to rough up the soles as they are slippery on our tile floor.
4.0,I love the bag itself how it was made in all but need to put size of all bag small medium or large but overall love it
4.0,I wear a 10/12 and ordered this in a M and love the fit. It is alot lighter weight than expected. It is soft and not itchy at all! I love the leopard print on this sweater and can see myself using this often. I love having cute and not dumpy sweaters to throw over a tank!
4.0,Purchased for a cruise. Love the color and fit. Versatile and comfortable. I'm very tall and love the length.
4.0,"These are super soft! I ordered a few colors and varieties. The Mint ones are the least stretchy of the lot. They fit really well, just a little difficult to get on/off. Not see through at all."
4.0,Looks just like the picture. I wish the fabric was more of a cotton fabric but it’s still nice.
4.0,Perfect all around.
4.0,Muy buena calidad. Excelente por el precio
4.0,This necklace looks like a much more higher priced piece of jewelry. I love it and get many compliments.
4.0,"Glasses are nice, but the bottom edge is a little short, giving a lot of wind turbulence to the eye while riding.  Also, the lenses don’t come out easily from the center nose piece.  But, hey…. They work!"
4.0,work great. I use these for my dog and goat ID tags and they are sturdy and function as described.
4.0,It's ok but it took some getting used to the side flap.  Doesn't hold many bills.  Everything else I like.
4.0,"Very comfortable and practical. They do run just a bit small if your foot size is a 12. Otherwise, they are a good buy."
4.0,Super cute my girls loved them. The air bulb sometimes is a little squished after one flop but still works good.
4.0,Fits well just no stretch. IF you want it roomy size up
4.0,"I thought I was ordering the same product I had in the shorts, just getting capris because I was so happy with the shorts.  The capris are somewhat tighter, and they do not have the two side pockets, they have a hidden pocket at the waistband.  I utilize these capris for workouts."
4.0,"The Doloise suspenders are decent quality, good width but the quality of the connecting material to the clips isn't very high quality and doesn't seem it will last very long. The small metal brackets that allow you to adjust the size of the suspenders is very difficult to operate and to release to resize."
4.0,"I liked these workout shirts so much that I bought them again, but the second set I got are much baggier even though I ordered the same size. Hopping that they will tighten up after a few washes."
4.0,Nice necklace that is great for male or female.
4.0,"Got this for hubby. It is a great match for his jacket, wallet, keychain, and of course, X5 M series truck.<br />It is very stylish. Only flaw - and it's a big deal - is the durability for long wear. The side broke open in less than a year. I couldn't find a replacement anywhere. It is a shame because this shoe is very fitting."
4.0,Very pretty top but fits large. Says not to put in drier but I did hoping it would shrink. It didn’t but it’s still a nice summer top.
4.0,"Bought for my husband, who is a lawyer. The plastic stays are great because metal ones go off in metal detectors. My only complaint is that the stays go flying when you're punching out the cards."
4.0,"The style didn’t look as nice in person as in the photo, but otherwise as advertised."
4.0,work as needed
4.0,These are a little thin and could be see through. I pair them with black wool tights so they are warm and I don't worry about them being see through. Overall good quality for what I paid for them. I like them.
4.0,The shirt is very attractive. However it runs small. I had to return it. It’s also very light weight. I’m not sure if it’s cheap fabric or what? Cute style. I might reorder it in a larger size.
4.0,nice bright blue and the fit was nice but the neckline was waaaaay too high for me. ended up giving it to my mom.
4.0,I got the leggings in heather brown. They fit perfect. I was looking for leggings similar to a pair I got at a thrift shop that happened to be American eagle brand. The only pair I have that have lasted 3 years with no holes. These are almost identical right down to the stitching. They're nice and thick. Not see through. Fit perfectly.  They  slide down a bit like all my other leggings but that's only because I pull them up over my belly botton. I'm a curvy person. But these are awesome. I'll be buying more if they hold up.<br /><br />Update. I bought two more pairs and I love them!! And my first pair is still perfect.
4.0,a little tight for people with big heads.
4.0,The purse is roomy and something I can use for every day use. It seems sturdy. No weird smells. The zipper on the front is just for decoration. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the embroidery design on the front is not center and there are a few loose threads here and there. Nothing that I see that could unravel. But the design being off is noticeble to me.
4.0,I got this for my father in law. He's a big fan of Rick and Morty. He liked it!!
4.0,"This sweater was not as soft as I had hoped and it was way too small.  I have purchased this brand before and always took a small.  I had to return the small and I bought the medium but wished I would have gotten a large.  It does look nice on, and washed up very nicely."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:28190598930829d330e55c4bcae26678]] Perfect for my diaper bag/backpack! The straps on my diaper bag were driving me crazy flapping around all the time. These definitely solved my problem and still allow me to adjust the straps as needed.<br /><br />I’ve also used these with a few of my kid’s costume wings to tighten them across the chest for a better fit. So glad the package comes with so many!
4.0,Nice piece had nice weight for a neck piece
4.0,Works great as a golf tote.
4.0,"Very slick little wallet, the outer access to primary card is great, i seldom have to actually open my wallet anymore"
4.0,Darker then pictured.
4.0,Looks more like a rose gold but still very cute. Can't wait to wear it on my honeymoon in Egypt!
4.0,Me parece que es un diseño muy seguro. Me gusto. Lo recomiendo.
4.0,"A great pair of shorts for the price. They have just enough padding, are light weight and a good length. I also like having a color other than black. I wish they came in more colors. The purple was not available, sadly, so I got navy. The navy is a very nice shade."
4.0,"Other than running small, these are great underwear. Once sizing was resolved, these have become one of my favorite pairs of underwear to wear around the house!"
4.0,"Very cute, but inconsistent in size. These two pairs I ordered several days apart. The second pair's hexagons are smaller and chains are much shorter."
4.0,I WILL GIVE IT TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER FOR HER B-DAY IN AUGUST.
4.0,Beautiful and substantial. Not to heavy
4.0,Don’t really like material but it was cute on. The material seems cheap so we will see what a wash cycle does to it. I needed.
4.0,"Incredibly Cute and Comfortable... I only gave it 4 stars because the arm holes will show your bra. I have to wear it with something that covers the bra. However, it is light and breezy and I really like it. I wear between a Large and X-LARGE. I bought several dresses at the same time in Large and they fit. I purchased this one in an X-LARGE and I'm glad I did because I feel like the Large would've been a tighter fit than I wanted. The material is stretchy though so a Large probably would've been okay. The size chart is pretty accurate."
4.0,The material is &#34;plastic&#34; looking and kind of cheap-looking.  I like the looks but not what they are made of.
4.0,"The shirt was nice, but fit too loose."
4.0,"it does work great as Casio Pro Trek should.  Solar powered and Atomic clock.<br />however, I had to return because of the look of the watch.  Probably some others might like the design of the dial and the bezel, but it really did not connect with me.<br />Anyway, you can never go wrong with Casio Pro Trek."
4.0,Fits much smaller then expected.  I read the reviews and went one size up but I still barely can squeeze into it
4.0,"Simple, functional, and water resistant. Oh, and I don’t have to take it off to go through airport security. It’s not particularly fashionable, but it’s great day-to-day and on my backpacking trips."
4.0,"The cut of this dress is generous so a medium was perfect. The color is pretty and as pictured, and the material feels very soft."
4.0,I like the colors . I do wish they were bigger to carry groceries
4.0,"Besides the oddball sizes, these are my favorite earrings. I may order another pair so I have a matching set."
4.0,"my 9yo daughter really likes the style of this watch & really likes that she can Choose So many color combos,  my only complaint is that the bezel that holds the watch face is not strong enough to hold the watch in When She's playing. In just a few minutes of Christmas morning revelry with Cousins, we were searching for the watch timepiece and ended up finding it in the couch cushion,  Were Still looking for a reusable glue solution> But when she's not roughhousing, It's great!"
4.0,Distorted print/ quality shirt
4.0,"I liked this skirt but, it did run on the large side. Had to return."
4.0,"Runs a bit small - more like junior's size.  I would typically wear a 4 or 6 in USA sizing, and I went with the medium/10 and it fit well.  Don't let the number sizes fool you."
4.0,"I'm a little self conscious about wearing snug leggings in public, so I  usually wear them with tunic length sweaters or jackets. I had hoped for a skirt that was just about that length, like the micro mini-skirts that I wore back in the early 1970's.  I was looking for a mini-skirt & legging combination that would work with cropped sweaters. I'm about 5'2"" and this skirt falls just about 2 inches above my knees. No reason that I can't wear it out and about, but it was not quite what I had in mind. I do like that it is sort of  A-line rather than pencil skirt. Also I thought it ran a little large."
4.0,We ordered 2 packs a small and large. They are good but we were missing one in the small package.
4.0,"It came with 2 of the piercings... and also a little bag to keep them in! But, one clamped harder than the other, which bummed me out. And it's too big to be a nose/snakebite piercing :( But overall pretty cool!!"
4.0,For the price they look really nice.
4.0,The seller recommends sizing up and I say the same. I usually wear a US large (12) and ordered and XL and it fits really nicely (if you like that fitted dress feel)<br />The material has nice stretch and it's not itchy. Some lines are sewed in to make the dress sit on he body a certain way and I find it flattering. So for less than $20 I think it looks great!<br />Ps: theres no wash label on it.. so I washed mine on delicate and hung it to dry to be safe
4.0,"The fit, and feel of these pants are extremely nice."
4.0,Just the perfect size and oh so comfy once you get them on. Was kind of difficult with the tiny screw back.  Would have liked a more ample back. Sadly. I had to return as the backs would not stay on. That is why I took off one star.
4.0,"The dress is adorable, but the fabric is a bit harsher than expected and the zipper just plain hurts your back if you have to sit too long. Otherwise, would be cute to wear if sitting wasn’t a concern and you had extra fabric softener in the wash!"
4.0,"The only reason why I won't give this product 5 stars is because it was easy to big for my daughter. I ordered 0-3 so she could wear it last winter and it was way to large for her. This is her now trying it on at 5months old. Extremely comfy , beautiful pattern and easy to put on. Luckily I have someone who can wear this later while I purchase a bigger size for this coming winter."
4.0,It worked for my purpose so I gave 4 stars. Would have given 5 stars had I not lost the end ring while trying to put it in.  I needed it for surgery and put it in then lost the little ring stopper while trying to put it on. So I put it in the other direction and hoped it stayed. It did! Maybe a better closure would help but I would recommend it!
4.0,"Runs a tad big, but it's ok because it leaves room for growth.  Pretty color pink!"
4.0,"I like this cardigan. It is thick and warm. Fits true to size. I am a 32 DD, 105lbs, and the xs fit perfectly. I just wish there were more colors to choose from."
4.0,Good but very light
4.0,Loving these jeans.  The detail is amazing.  They do sit low on the hips.
4.0,"Very pretty, but extremely narrow through the shoulders."
4.0,"The jeans run big.  I am a size 10 with no gut or butt.  The large were big on me.  Also, I was looking for a wider leg.  These are straight and baggy.  Especially baggy through the hips and thighs.  But well made jeans.  I would have kept them if they had fit better."
4.0,These are cute earrings to wear when you are in a fun mood. Very light weight. I would recommend  for sure.
4.0,"The color is really pretty, but they don’t mention that one side that is completely open. I had to take it to my tailor to have it sewn up. It’s fine now."
4.0,True to size.. Just what I needed.
4.0,"Button-down sleep shirt, is comfortable and has a nice silky feel."
4.0,"Not as big as I had hoped, but I love the color and will use for a different purpose than I intended."
4.0,Great value like the socks little thin
4.0,I read reviews and got a large because i have a 30G (34DDD) bust. A medium would have been ok but i dont mind the xtra room. Im 5’4” 138 lbs. Hope this helps someone pick a size. The back of the lace is see thru so thats why I gave it 4 out of 5.
4.0,"This is the second time I purchased a pair of these. I ordered the same size but the first pair ran smaller and fit better, but still a good product nonetheless."
4.0,The socks are comfortable and seem to fit well so far!
4.0,"I bought two of these because my teen daughter is always stealing all of my hoodies! So I bought one for each of us. She is about 5ft 1in, just over 100 pounds and I bought her a small, which fits her great. I bought myself a medium. I am about 5ft 3in, around 135 pounds. I am always worried about things being too small, so I am glad I decided to get a medium for more room. Great fit, great room. Fleece material inside. I am giving 5 stars because this could be an issue of personal preference, and I would hate to knock the rating bc of that. I was going to rate 4 stars, but decided not to because of what I just mentioned. This is definitely not a sweatshirt I can leave on all day. The outer material is like a certain type of nylon or something, that I just don't feel meets the quality of Under Armour, or myself. I just mean it sort of gets irritating on my skin after awhile. The sleeves are a bit long too, it would be nice if there was a hand thingy on the end of the sleeve. Overall though, good sweatshirt."
4.0,"Very pretty, lightweight, smaller than expected"
4.0,"I like the ring. The only thing wrong was, I would of liked some info to be with the ring, since it was a gift for someone. It would of been nice for them to know the meaning of the ring."
4.0,They are very good quality for the boots. I love the shape and look. They run narrow so you may want to go up 1 size that way you can get more than a couple months wear out of them. All in all still love them!
4.0,"These were exactly what I was looking for! I have had them for months now, maybe a year.  No holes but they do have some pulling at the top of the waistband. Good material.  I am 5'5 and the length is perfect for me. I would call them true to size.  I would buy these again, but these are not comparable to Lulus... think more like old navy."
4.0,I purchased this product instead of others because the blue shirt in the photo looked like it was Navy. The actual color is more Royal than Navy. The products themselves appear to be of good quality.
4.0,"Look good, Frame made of metal, the mirror finish is impressive and when used a sunlight do his job as expected I would give a 5 star if lenses were more thick"
4.0,This fit my 11yr old really nice. The shirt was nice quality and seems durable. Nice affordable dress shorts for a young man.
4.0,"Beautiful, but it didnt cling to body like shown."
4.0,The earrings are beautiful just really thin on the post bend to easily. Other than that really nice.
4.0,"The belt is very attractive and is pretty good quality.  I ordered a small and ended up returning only because I was looking for waist belt - and this belt fit around my hips.  (Which looks really great btw, just not what I needed it for)  Disclaimer:  I am a 5'2&#34; petite individual.  I'd recommend this belt to anyone and I wish I had the extra funds to have kept it."
4.0,Fits beautifully.  Brought medium. Warm for cool office
4.0,Fits just as expected. Perfect bikini bottom.  No complaints here.
4.0,Was. Very satisfied with purchase
4.0,GOT A BIGGER SIZE than your regular ring size. Good quality ring. A little thinner than I prefer in rings.
4.0,Very nice but I had 2 white color
4.0,"Bety nice flower, but the chain doesn't look like silver!"
4.0,Excellent quality. Will highly recommend.
4.0,"These socks are a bit thinner than I was hoping for an athletic sock, but I have small feet and they fit well."
4.0,Wished they were a little thicker.
4.0,My daughter wore this for Halloween and it looks great!
4.0,"Despite reading the reviews it's still bulkier than I expected. The weight is slightly off putting, as is the rattle of the stone moving about, which means I can't wear it to work(quiet is required and noisy jewelry heavily frowned on). Still, I do like it."
4.0,This item is too long but I will give it to a family member that is much taller than I.
4.0,"It’s very light weight perfect for those slightly cooler evenings.  The fit was great.  I am about 188lbs, 5’4” with an apple figure and bought the 2x. It’s somewhat roomy, the way I like it.  Having said that, it does not stretch not at all.  That is the only con."
4.0,I like this shirt. It is a nice T but not worth more than the price I paid.  It is a bit thin.  I do have to say that it looks great and I do not regret the purchase. I cannot go 5 stars because it just is not a 5 star shirt. I think it is a good purchase.  Hope this helps if you are considering it.
4.0,"I've gotten several compliments because while yes, this bag is -says- HK, it doesn't scream it like some Sanrio products may. The bag is smaller than I anticipated because of the width of the bag. I would say anyone using this to carry several items could fit maybe a medium size water bottle widthwise before it becoming bulky. The make of the bag is excellent though, the burlap is very resistant to stains, and the bow is well secured. (That was a lot more pronounced on that bag than I would it would be too, considering it is attached at just the center, the entire bow is not securely attached to the bag from all the edges)."
4.0,"My favorite color is blue!  I was very excited to try this necklace.  On screen it looked very enticing and fun and would go with many of my outfits.  I was excited to finally receive this today and put it with my favorite blue shirt…to find that the necklace more turquoise than blue.  The shirt that I thought it was going to go perfect with is a dark Phatalo Blue and my husband agrees that the leather straps are more turquoise than blue.<br />The stones are very cute, but I’m not sold that they are genuine stone.  Three have 90 degree bends leading me to believe that some of this is shell that has been dyed.  Other pieces I could not find evidence of striations that are typical to all types of stone (rocks, fossils, crystals etc.) that I am familiar with.  The gold colored “chain” that they are placed onto is very light and has barely any weight to it.  I unfastened it from my neck a couple of times to try out the sizing and the extender did somehow become detached from the necklace via a very tiny gap in the ring.  This necklace was produced in China.<br />This is still an interesting piece to have in my collection, though I feel that this necklace is rather cheaply constructed.<br />I received Multi-Strand Fashion Necklace Featuring Gold Chain and Polished Charms for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.  My words are that of my own and were not swayed by the vendor in any way."
4.0,"Love the hoodie. My soon to be 5 year old is a bit small, so I expected the XS to be a little large, all though he wears a US 4-6. The hoodie fits my soon to be 10 year old son who wears a size 8/10. At least we know he will be able to wear it for many years before outgrowing it. We got the Sonic running through the ring and the graphic is top notch quality. Shipping was fast"
4.0,"These gorgeous earrings are perfect for a dressier outfit or for jazzing up something a little bit simpler. The material they are made of does make them a little bit heavy so if you usually wear lighter earrings I wouldn't suggest them for you but other than the weight, they are comfortable. They have great movement to them and the pastel pink is gorgeous. Would recommend for anyone who enjoys dangly earrings for a statement."
4.0,"The quality is great but the sizing is inconsistent. I have two extra large hats, one which fits fine and the other which is a full half inch too big. That said this is a nice quality hard-to-find item"
4.0,Nice product for the price point.  She likes them a lot!
4.0,"Honestly they were way nicer than I expected and it fit snug, very comfortable to wear &lt;3 I am very happy with these. My only complaint is the fake zipper pocket XD why does that exist. Otherwise, I am very pleased with this order :D"
4.0,"The color is beautiful and vibrant, but I was disappointed at how short  and small they are."
4.0,Material a bit hard.
4.0,"Ok this shirt fits exactly how the black and white plaid one shows, fits perfectly everywhere but it does not even come close to closing over my chest. So lots of chest if I don't wear a tank top. The other pictures I believe show the blouse closed all the way up. I ordered a large, I have been wearing mediums lately and even they run a little big, so I ordered up due to the sizing running small.  I still like the blouses I just wish I could close up the top a little more."
4.0,For a faux diamond these are great with lots of sparkle. Slightly smaller than I expected but still a good buy
4.0,So many other women loved this bathing suit. I’m a big girl and so that made me feel more confident. The bottoms run a little small but still ok overall.
4.0,This is just a funny shirt. Pretty comfortable. My wife enjoyed the gag.
4.0,The colors are not attached together but in sections. Besides this issue it was a hit with my 5 year old.
4.0,Amazing Jewlery but the 1/4 is wayyyy to small I have no idea how anyone could fit that into their nose!!
4.0,No frame on the top to get in the way of your line of sight when riding in the drops.  Cheap.  Works great.  Good seller.  Wish I would get it in photochromic version or with other lens choices but this is great value and these are already my favorite glasses compared to a bunch I have bought at many times the price.
4.0,It is actually a little larger than I expected but the material is also nicer than I thought it would be. Construction looks good and zippers and strap seem sturdy.
4.0,Gloves are nice but somewhat small
4.0,"It is very nice and I even bought one for my mom because she liked it so. I just wish the zipper laid flatter instead of stiff, which makes it bubble out in places. Not very noticeable, probably more to my when I’m sitting. It is holding up nicely."
4.0,"The necklace part of this set has become one of my favorite fashion jewelry pieces....the stone is a lovely shade... just like the product picture...the pendant is solid and smooth on the back end...it is a good size ... the stones that are around the blue are a nice sparkle touch... the chain is very delicate... pretty, but not something I would trust to a young child... definitely jewelry for a teen or adult.... the earrings are a nice match to the necklace... they are beautiful and a perfect color match for the necklace...I do not use them as often... I wear a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis, so dangle earrings are saved for special occasions...they are also a little heavy, so I would not want to wear them for long periods of time..."
4.0,"La tela es mucho más delgada de lo que esperaba y con textura. Normalmente ocupo talla M, compré  un L, debería haber comprado M"
4.0,"Beautiful print but not as soft as others I have purchased.  Great value for the price. I use heat transfer vinyl to monogram these and they are a great gift. The shape is slightly smaller than those of the same size, but due to the style I don't think it would be a problem. Would definitely order again because the design is so cute!"
4.0,Very satisfied with shirt fabric and fit
4.0,Had to cop it for The Big Dog Roman Reigns
4.0,Loved the material.
4.0,Looked and fit as expected. Perfect for a 70’s theme
4.0,Good quality but the lenses are thin and I’m pretty sure they aren’t polarized. They will do for now though. At the price I really can’t say anything negative other then that.
4.0,Great for a gift.
4.0,"Love the feel of these shorts.  They are high waisted, very soft and have pockets.  They are a little shorter than I prefer since they are high waisted, but I can still get away with them.  Cute shorts."
4.0,Looks great but kind of wobbly when it was put together and screws to assemble panels with are too small
4.0,"Skirt was very wrinkled. But I  tried it on, it's beautiful. Fit and style. Have to get out the iron though. Hope it's only winkled from shipping!"
4.0,"I got my mom a medium based off the measurements. She said the top was a bit small. It fits, it just squeezes her breasts a bit. Other than that she loves it!"
4.0,lorem ipsum [I just want the rating to post]
4.0,Great for women with long legs
4.0,"UPDATE: after a couple wears and one wash the metal crimped tip on the left drawstring fell off…slightly disappointed as now it looks uneven and only after light wear.<br /><br />These flowy shorts are very comfy and good for casual wear. The material is a shiny stretchy spandex that is a bit slippery depending on what surface you’re sitting on. The fabric itself is pretty thing however due to the style of it being bunched overall it’s a pretty heavy product which for me isn’t idea for running/cardio/impact workouts but they’re perfect for lounging in. While the waist band does fit when it’s not rolled over, I like the fit much more when I did.<br />There is only one pocket on the right side as well. This is an interesting style that I’ve been seeing a lot of and glad I got them.”!"
4.0,"I'm I'm 5'6&#34;, 120 lbs, and fairly slim but still the sleeves were very tight and the dress was much longer than it looks; it came down to just a few inches above my knees. Like a few other reviewers, i also had an issue with the shoulders sliding off. I returned it, but I'm sure it would look cute on the right body type. The print was beautiful; colors are very vibrant and the material was very soft."
4.0,"Sleeves are long, plus from the photo I thought I was getting a jacket with a zip front. But I still love it. Very well made."
4.0,"Great gi! They run big, even after washing and drying. I'm 205ibs at 6' 1&#34; and I'm swimming in the A3... Go a size smaller unless you're more comfortable in rolling without pants, because they will fall off!"
4.0,It's ok. It gets caught on things so I couldn't really wear it long. But it is perfect for sandals or flip flops.
4.0,Great fit great price good optics
4.0,"This is SUPER cute. It's the perfect size to fit in my rook piercing, not so big it sticks out and not too small to fit around the piece of cartilage. It's also nice and sturdy without being too hard to bend."
4.0,Nice necklace. Should have matching earrings
4.0,Cute shirt and good quality but runs extremely small. It fit my daughter so i didn't have to return.
4.0,"Nice piece. I followed the sizing chart and previous reviews but it still didn't fit me. I am VERY top heavy and there wasn't nearly enough space for my breasts to fit. I doubt the larger size (I bought a 4x, I am 5 ft 4 and 226 lbs, J cup bra, 38 in band) would even come close without being painful."
4.0,"Sheer lining, cute sleeves, very comfy. I do love this dress but not giving it 5 stars as the rouched (sp?)area on the top area that should sit just under the breasts?  The bottom half of that rouching, it sits on my breasts, so its a bit awkward, but it fits otherwise, and i still do love the dress on. Know that it is shorter in the back than it is in the front as well."
4.0,I like this dress it has a higher square neck. Its cute
4.0,"I love this necklace: the only issue is this is formatted for those with a small neck.  Its a little uncomfortable, but I receive alot of compliments on it when I wear it."
4.0,I liked these shoes so much I bought two new pairs
4.0,Like the mask but don't like it restricted breathing it causes. Was not delivered on time either!
4.0,"cute suit.  happy with it, especially with the price I paid.  some of the stitching is a little cheap and uneven but for the price, i can't complain.  another bonus was that it fit great.  I ordered a small and I'm 5' 5&#34; 120 lbs."
4.0,"Perfect Subtle Star Wars wallet. The logo is a bit on the bulky side and makes it difficult to put in a tight pocket, but overall it is a great wallet. Hoping over time it will get easier to pull cards out of the slots."
4.0,Has good traction for the pool area and locker room of my gym. Very lightweight.
4.0,Nothing disliking
4.0,"Great inexpensive extra pair of shoes for my toddler. The color was as pictured, though they ran 1/2 - 1 full size too big."
4.0,The strap need to be fixed to the glasses because it slips easily
4.0,The flap on the neck doesn’t fold down like the photo
4.0,"This dress is flattering and comfortable, but I would recommend dry cleaning.  With machine washing, it's all balled up after four washes.  It's also quite long, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 5'4&#34;, even if you're going to wear heels with it."
4.0,Purchased 4 in different sizes. They fit great when I got them. After putting in dryer the length of the shirts shrunk. Still a good purchase. Just don't put them in the dryer....hang dry only. :)
4.0,"it is padded a little more that I wanted, but I still like it"
4.0,"I like the neck line on this shirt.  It is a little shorter than I like, but it will work ok.  It is well made."
4.0,"First, they are truly beautiful glasses…I get compliments all the time. It’s also made a big difference to get my reading glasses with the blue light, it helped my eyes not be so tired at the end of the day. The only reason I’m giving them a 4 star is because I’ve had them for 3-4 months and they have started chip at the ends, they are bubbling on the ends.  The price is fair enough to get more, definitely will buy more but next tome I will<br />pick different colors!"
4.0,Fun!  Thanks.
4.0,This is so light I forgot it was there!
4.0,Super cute and soft I had two problems with it tho has black marks on the rainbow that won’t come off and I order a XL fits like a Large.
4.0,"I got two of these sweaters in different colors. They are pretty substantial for the price (I think I paid around $13 apiece). The only thing I don't like is the width at the bottom; it is too flared. I wanted to wear these as tunic sweaters over leggings, so I think I'll take in the sides at bottom to hang closer to the hip."
4.0,"I ordered a 3xl. I am normally an XL in ""men's"" shirts. This was snug. I stretched it out a little and have worn it once. Other than that, the shirt is great as I love the quote. The product arrived before promised. I will recommend this product to everyone, but will tell them it runs small. I hope you enjoy your purchase as much as I do mine."
4.0,The material is T-shirt material. It does ok being washed. It feels good on the skin and the color is beautiful. The color does not wash out.
4.0,"After reading all the reviews, I purchased a size lager that I would normally take, That WAS A MISTAKE. I should have ordered medium as usual. Unfortunately, I had to return these as the large was enormous. These are actually quite long as well. I did think that they looked very nice, and the patterns were great."
4.0,Ok so the boot is great. I’m a 8.5 so I got a 9.5 and it fits perfect. A little roomy in the toe box which is good. The heel is sturdy & and and a good height. The weird thing is that one of the boot was moldy!!!! Yes it had mold all over. So I am returning it and getting a diff pair. Hopefully it’s ok because it’s a great boot.
4.0,Satisfied with shirt and size overall. Color is not the same as in advertised picture as it is dark maroon not red. This was a little disappointing to my son but he still liked it.
4.0,Product was exactly like it was online. Very pleased!
4.0,A bit on the large size.  Not very comfortable.
4.0,"Dress is great! Nice material. I ordered it a size up due to the other reviews, it wasn't needed"
4.0,"Material is thin, but very comfortable!! Will definitely have to wear something over in the winter weather."
4.0,Good quality. I was expecting them to be longer based on the picture. I'm still using them though!😀
4.0,Cute! Except my mask was bent up when it arrived. I barely wore it but good costume overall.
4.0,NOT 100% on the stitching on front
4.0,Pretty dress!  I wear a large but ordered an XL since most things from China run small. It’s still too small.
4.0,the colors are way more vibrant in the picture but a cute shirt overall
4.0,my child likes it she received it as a Christmas present and wears it when she can.
4.0,My only problem is the shoe lace is to short. I have big thighs and the lace just to short to tie. Need longer shoe lace
4.0,"Seems to be a well made belt, especially for the price. However I got it to replace a ""Slide Belt"" brand belt that the leather part had gone bad without getting a buckle. Unfortunately it is too thick to go thru the buckle and I can't use it for that. I do also have a ""Click Belt"" brand that it fits so I will keep for the inevitable time when the plastic click part will fail. If you are buying this a a replacement for the expensive slide belt be warned, it may not fit."
4.0,The bottom of the blue could stand to be a little larger. It's a small struggle to get it on but it's not going to move once you get it in place. But it's not so tight that it's uncomfortable.<br /><br />The elastic under the boobs could be a little tighter. I wouldn't go running in this but I would feel comfortable walking around and possibly playing volleyball in it. It's pretty supportive and comfortable. Love the adjustable straps.<br /><br />I did some moving around and hand no issues with the bottomes. I do like that the sides have ties on them. When I had them on the opening for where they tie was at about an inch to and in and a half.<br /><br />I'm 5'4&#34; and 170. I wear a 34dd. So I'm sort and pudgy. I feel like that's important for they types of reviews. I orders a large.
4.0,I ordered four pairs of clip-ons for my granddaughter's Christmas present.  They all look good.  All arrived intact and exactly what I expected.
4.0,This dress is very comfortable and looks just like the photos. I would recommend buying a size down. I normally order large but this one a medium would have still been loose but flattering. I did keep the dress though because it's great or around the house.
4.0,Fast shipment fits exactly how described very cute for Christmas not too dressy but yet not casual. It was perfect for my company Christmas party
4.0,"Bought for a beach bag but it is more hand bag sized. Pay attention to measurements, it is smaller than the pictures lead you to believe. However I am keeping as it does seem sturdy and of good quality"
4.0,"Very nice product, great quality."
4.0,It was perfect but I didn’t order 2 of them!!! Now I have to return one!
4.0,I thought the socks would be a littler thicker but that's ok
4.0,"for $10 its a good deal ,hold up well in the wash ...i wear mine once a week so its been washed a few times , the only problem i found was that the under layer was shorter than the top layer so you saw the difference when worn ...."
4.0,"These bracelets are pretty great. I have 4 Lilly and Laura brand glass bracelets and at $12 each, my obsession was getting expensive. I ordered these and while the colors definitely didn't go together well, individually they're really pretty and look very similar to L&L. I know the mix is random, so they might be worn together well for you, but my colors clashed pretty bad (my reason for the four stars) I attached a picture of a Lilly and Laura bracelet (the tan one) and this brand (the coral/pink one) for comparison. They're pretty close! All in all a great buy, if you're ok with the random mix! Just beware that you may not be able to wear them together! ;) worth the $10 chance"
4.0,"Very nice, liked the long length and color, and also the 3d effect of the eye itself...however the one thing I didn't like is when u wear the necklace the eye doesn't typically face up, it faces down towards the ground instead of out in front of you.other than that I love it 4 stars :)"
4.0,need to order at least a size larger
4.0,A great value. A similar item at Men's Warehouse cost over $100+.
4.0,Not super expensive but certainly more than Hanes. Good quality construction and cotton. I will probably buy them again.
4.0,this was a gift.  My friend loves it.
4.0,I use this bag everyday and it holds a ton of things but be careful because the straps are kind of thin. The color is a nude almost pink and black. It goes with everything. I love the outside pocket. I definitely recommend this bag.
4.0,My daughter loves it!. Super soft. Fits great.
4.0,Looks good and distributes weight evenly. One of the inner pockets ripped after about 6 months of use. You cant notice from the outside
4.0,"Unfortunately, it was a little see-through but made it work. it's very comfortable and flowy. The fabric is very fresh for this weather."
4.0,It is a nice shirt but was somewhat tighter than I was expecting for a size 3x
4.0,Surprisingly handsome and decent for the price. It had an odd smell initially but seems to have off gassed most of what I assume is a curing chemical for the leather.<br />Long term durability is of questionable quality but for me this strap is on one of my more novelty watches so it's fine for limited use.
4.0,I didn't expect a long one as most reviewers did. I was perfect and worked great for my mrs. Santa
4.0,Exactly as described. I'd like a way to keep it from slipping off but overall it's good.
4.0,"Works for my magnet craft. Very clear unlike the glass marbles, but does not magnify as much."
4.0,"I ordered this UV protection Sun Visor Wide hat because it was pink floral and a big floppy hat! I have recently come to enjoy the crazy trend of the big floppy hat and love wearing mine out and about. I have received many compliments on my hat. The hat is a basic hat but is the fun bg floppy hat that is a lot of fun for gardening or out door events, such as sports or a day at the beach. The hat fit as I expected it to. This item fits nicely not to small not too large, I would like to think I have a pretty normal sized head. The hat is good quality and cute. Disclaimer I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,This is a great product! The fold size is just perfect and the material is top notch along with the color. The only downsides are the tight credit card slots that make it difficult to take cards out and put them back in with ease and it's a bit pricey for my liking.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:175075f6244972afdd0d620e048b2bc1]] The upper body is fitted but the waist down is regular fit but the mask and cape are good.
4.0,"I needed these for work since I wasn't allowed to wear my flesh tunnels. Just as expected, however my ears started healing and got stuck to them if I wore them for too long. I'd suggest taking them out every once in a while to avoid this."
4.0,It has a nice thick large hood and is comfortable. The hood actually covers my whole head and doesn't just cover like half or 3/4 of my head. Not crazy about the elastic waist riding up above my belt sometimes and then having to adjust it back down but not a big deal. I still like it.
4.0,Initially felt a bit snug but loosened up quickly. Moderately sturdy sole. Likely won't last more than a few years but fit fine & keep my feet warm which is the most important function that I needed. A plus that they look nice.
4.0,"I just got this, but I am in love on day one! (I will try to remember to update if anything changes) It's a nice band, I like that it is thinner than the original apple watch band with a real clasp. I am a size 8 wrist (medium/large) and it fits nicely. This is my first watch band purchase and I'm happy."
4.0,Looks really nice but also easy to destroy
4.0,"This is a great ring for $2! It is not a moonstone, what people say about the coloris true. It's mostly white but it came one day earlier than expected and it isn't cheapy quality. The sizing is half size smaller so you may have to put it on a different finger than you originally planned but overall I think it's great for $2!"
4.0,"Seemed to fit really tight on my 5 year old who is 43 inches tall. I bought a small based on size chart.  But maybe they are supposed to fit tight.  She wore it comfortably, no complaints so I think it was fine."
4.0,Very beautiful. Disappointed as the plum purple arrived as a pink fusia. Not purple at all. The quality seems nice. I am 5’7 and 130 lbs and ordered a medium. It’s a little big and I should have gotten a small
4.0,"Not 100% cotton, but still very nice. I was looking for 100% cotton for light weight and breathability in summer weather. Poly-blend creates a bit of heat."
4.0,"Very cute and comfortable. I was worried about the length, but it hits me about mid thigh. I’m 5’4”. An XL doesn’t gap at my 38C bust. My only wish is that there was a draw string at the waist to give it a bit more fit, instead of just a decorative tie that makes it  look like it does. The lining keeps it from being too sheer without dragging down the fabric."
4.0,Nice ring bought for daughter she loves it that's all that really matters shipping was fast and came as pictured
4.0,"After reading all the reviews on how small this shirt fits, I decided to order a size larger for my husband. Bad choice, WAY too big. I could have ordered a size smaller than what my husband normally wears and it would have fit perfectly!"
4.0,Ok quality. Cute though. Would by it again.
4.0,Es Hermosa
4.0,"wears out in five months, but before that it's comfortable"
4.0,"Bought this as a temporary watch to wear while the watchband on my favorite watch was being replaced. It works fine, and I was pleased by the appearance, especially considering the low price point. I appreciated the little tool included for do-it-yourself downsizing of the band. It wasn't easy, but I managed it, and it saved me a bill from the local jeweler to do it."
4.0,I’m pretty long in the torso so this fits more like an empire waistline on me. Cute idea but the seam hits me just below the shoulder blades in the back.
4.0,"I am 5'11&#34; and 150lbs. (tall and somewhat still slender). If you want this to fit loosely like on the model, I suggest you order up a size or two. I ordered a Large and I like the looseness of it. And if you want to tighten it up a bit, just tie the knot a little tighter. Have not washed it yet, but the material is a little rough."
4.0,I love this dress...I get lots of compliments!! I will order the short sleeved one in the Spring!!
4.0,Great statement piece.  Lots of compliments on this one.  I have a larger neck so the extender doesn't help as much as I wish it would.  Have had no issues with it folding while wearing it.  I do love the folding when I store it hanging on my jewelry organizer.  It saves space.  The gold has worn off after 2 wears.  Arrived promptly.
4.0,Like the romper but it needs to be tacked in the chest cuz i am small chested. And the length in the torso is a little shorter than i would like but im keeping it cuz it still fits ok. I am 5’9” 155 pounds.
4.0,Cute but it's huge.
4.0,"These are lovely...painted nicely...But are larger than I thought they were...Bought for my young grand daughter, but I am giving them to my daughter instead as they are too large for the grand...."
4.0,Haven't got to try them out yet but touch screen does work and they are comfortable
4.0,"Bike gloves are tight, but these might be a little tighter than that. Overall, cheap price, fun print, cant be mad."
4.0,Smaller then I imagined
4.0,"I love the coat.. I’m 5’5 and got a large based on the comments saying to go up a size. It was way too long.. but apparently the coats don’t have a medium size. I wish they made a few more colors! Keeps me warm though, even without the hood"
4.0,"Cute shoes, but runs wide."
4.0,"This bag is super durable, nice smooth zipper pulls and lots of pockets and places to stick stuff. The neoprene handle which I thought was useless is actually very handy and the key clip under the flap makes it easy to grab my keys. I'm gonna buy a couple more soon because they are worth it. The mesh pouch on the inside did break apart but I was never gonna use it."
4.0,Good for someone looking for a lightweight and non bulkey wallet .
4.0,Super cute!! Love it
4.0,Beautiful although the letter M is not perfectly centered. My gift for my husbee on our wedding day. He likes it!
4.0,"These are decent leggings. I bought a large and they fit well. The material is a bit thin, but still hot. I wore them on my walk today (I live in south florida) and they were SO hot. I'll probably use them in cooler months. They also really accentuated my lumpy dumpy knee (I broke my patella last year). So if you have something you're trying to cover, these arent great for that. Other than them retaining heat, they're comfortable."
4.0,This was a good purchase. I would definitely recommend it. The only downside was the size. They are so tiny. They really sparkle nicely.
4.0,Not bad. Does cover. Definitely enhance.
4.0,I thought that there would be hidden compression like other miracle suits but there wasn’t. I guess it’s just the style and fabric that is so darn flattering. Very comfortable but not a lot of support for the gals.
4.0,"beautiful, but the slip underneath is too short even on me 5'3"
4.0,my 3-1/2 year old grandson wears it
4.0,"Cute shirt, very soft and comfortable.  I have worn it around the house, but I have also dressed it up with cute jewelry and nice jeans.  Very versitile shirt."
4.0,"I love it. It's a bit bulkier than I thought, and looks a little cheap, but it's just so funky and fun. It's worth the couple dollars."
4.0,I really liked the suit. But the fit was too small so I had to return it. I'm 5'8&quot; 150lbs. I wear a size 8. I read the reviews and tried the large but the bottoms were way too small and the top was slightly too small. I'm a 36C. I could've used an XL and I think it would have worked. Otherwise nice suit looked just like the picture.
4.0,This is a well made ring that is beautiful! It’s a little heavy.
4.0,"After a week of wearing, the finish flaked off"
4.0,Fit is comfy but this is an at-home dress for relaxing- the bodice hasn’t got too much allowance for a well endowed person so the fit is a bit off for me. Quality construction; good fabric weight so it doesn’t get stuck in between your legs when walking… I would purchase again if my shape and the dress were more compatible.
4.0,"The fit is very good and the sleeve length is perfect. It's hard to find a shorter sleeve length in department stores, so this is great. My only complaint would be that the material doesn't really feel like broadcloth to me."
4.0,"sides were loose; other than that, I love them!"
4.0,good quality. My son has been wearing them for about 9 months an they are starting to wear but that is to be expected given the amount of time. I decided to buy more of these for him in larger sizes.
4.0,This is a beautiful piece! I gave it to my daughter and she loved it. The stones are very pretty colors.
4.0,Very pretty and hard-to-find
4.0,Ok. Thought it would be just a bit larger though.
4.0,"I love this dress. It's so light and comfortable. Very cool. There's a lining of a slip so it's not see through. The color is just as advertised. It's also very soft and fits true to size .<br /><br />Update: so sad. It shrinks SO much after washing! I will say, I did wash in the machine but I hung to dry. Wrinkles a lot too but that was to be expected with the fabric. I’m not sure but as much as it shrank, I think it would if I hand washed it."
4.0,"I thought the straps were little removable, velcro straps, but they're not; they're rubberbands. This isn't terrible for using on your fingers and such, but the velcro is better because you can strap them onto your bike and such for visibility (Burning Man!)."
4.0,Usually driving with my bifocals.....But always when out in the sun.
4.0,I love it. So much comfortable.
4.0,"This shirt is heavy flannel. It looks well made.<br />However, if you are tall, it may be too short in the arms. I am 5'9&#34; and ordered the 7XL. I washed it in cold and hung up to dry. There was quite a bit of shrinkage...never a good thing."
4.0,It came with 2 filters. Easy to breathe mask. Nice color won’t fade because of the material. Adjustable ear bands make it easier to adjust.
4.0,Shined up silver I had not used in months in minutes...just left my hands black...wear gloves...
4.0,"they are a bit long but super cute and comfortable very good material , thick and not see through"
4.0,All I can say is that the band width is great but its a bit short for the size of my wrist which is a bit large.  I gave it to my son and he really likes it. and I just wish it would have fit my wrist.
4.0,"Really like this necklace. I get lots of compliments on it when I wear it. Only suggestion is: I wish they made the chain a little bit longer. Feels like it sits too high, and I don't have an unusually large neck or anything. Really cute and would recommend."
4.0,"These are really cute, but run large. If you have a slim kid, these will probably be too big."
4.0,"Super cute, but not sure if it’s 14k filled, as advertised."
4.0,"[[ASIN:B01N3TUS2S HOMEYEE Women's Elegant Chic Bodycon Formal Dress B288 (4XL, A-Light Pink)]] after reading the reviews I got the 4x to be safe because, its a little long so I will hem it but its beautiful and the material is great"
4.0,"T-shirt is great/normal quality. Unisex fit. I noticed it is not as black as my other t-shirts. It has more of a deep navy blue color, which makes wearing it with dark blue jeans more of a blueberry outfit."
4.0,"The material is different than what I was expecting. It's hard to explain the look and feel of it. It has a sheen I wasn't expecting. The bottom flares out a little more like a dress than a tunic, for me, because it is long. Longer than I thought it would be. I'm pleased that I can wear leggings and have my rear end covered."
4.0,"Good looking and warm hat, fits as if it was made for my rather large head and sits tightly on it, doesn't slide off. The interior is pleasant to the touch and scalp. I do tend to sweat a bit so when I return I have to turn it inside-out to let it dry out. I haven't had the opportunity to wear it in very cold weather but overall a good item that I don't regret getting.<br /><br />Update: After having this hat for a few weeks I can say I tested it in 20-degree weather and I did not feel any cold draft on my head. Test passed. However, the hat is rather delicate. It is essentially 2 hats made from different materials sown together at the top and along the bottom. I once pulled it on giving it a slightly harder tug and the seam ripped for about 3 inches. For the money I paid for it I don't expect this hat to last forever but if I'm very gentle with it it should last for for a couple of winters."
4.0,Now that I am retired from military.  I am on a mission to acquire  a variety of handbags ;matching wallets are a must for me.
4.0,Check the measurements of the dangle before you buy.  These are bigger than I expected - I'm happily surprised.  The gold wire work is beautifully done.  They are not heavy; they show well on!<br /><br />I'm rating down from 5 to 4 because the darker stone chips are not as true to dark amethyst as shown in the picture.  Be very careful when you take the earring off the cardboard backing.  Two of the lighter stone chips fell off in my hand.  I'm going to reinforce the glue on the back of all the pieces in an effort to keep all intact.
4.0,I love these mask. The fit is great and comfortable. They are well made.
4.0,"All in all, a very nice dress for the price.  I do wish the fabric were a little thicker.  I will need to wear a slip underneath.  Runs a little small -- I normally wear a size L, but bought an XL based on other reviews, and the XL fits about right.  I'm 5""3"" and the length was good me -- about an inch of the floor in 2"" heels.  But if you are taller, it might be too short."
4.0,"There may be higher quality chokers, but this is a great option for the price.  No complaints."
4.0,"I ordered an XL hoping for it to be “oversized”, but when I received it, it’s size was more like a Medium fit! Be sure to size up at least 2 sizes for the right fit. The quality of the hoodie isint bad, wish it were cotton, but it’s more like nylon. The seller was very easy to communicate with and resolved the sizing issue for me without hassle!!"
4.0,"The only problem I have with this dress is the navy is too dark, the picture gave me the impression it was a lighter navy. Truthfully I don't know why other reviews are saying that they thought the navy was black, I think it's pretty clear in the picture it was blue-ish. Does look MORE blue in sunlight but still not as blue nor shiny as the picture. Other reviewers pictures look more like mine's darker colors so check them out for the actual shade. Considering that other viewer's pictures all look DARK - near black I still find the seller's picture to not be a monitor settings/monitor pixel definitions problem. Maybe they just shined too much light on the product when taking their picture? I don't know but found it kinda disappointing.<br /><br />HOWEVER, color aside the dress so far is really nice. Fits beautifully and comfortably. I usually have the problem with the sleeve cut on dresses or shirts cutting into my armpits but this one has a lower armpit line. Very cute on. Easy to make modest or cleavage-y.<br /><br />Top part I think is cotton, the bottom however is polyester. At first when I saw the tag saying 95% polyester I thought they lied to us about it being cotton. They only half lied. :P  There are two tags, one readying &#34;component 95% polyester 5% Spendex&#34; and the other &#34;component 95% cotton 5% Spendex&#34;. &#34;Component&#34; I'm assuming meaning a part of the dress and not the whole dress. Correct me if I'm wrong, internet goers. And yes it says Spendex and not Spandex. Considering it's a product of China I figure it's a translation error.<br /><br />All in all I find the dress super cute. I think I may buy two other colors I have my eye on."
4.0,The last necklace isn't worth anything to me. I would give it to a child for dress up playtime. It's thin and cheap. The other three are easy to wear and hang nicely. They are thicker and higher quality.
4.0,Product is not true to size. Order at least one size larger than you normally wear.
4.0,Cute tennis skirt. Love the pattern. Runs small - size up if between.
4.0,"Got it for a 7-year old. Works great, lots of different colors to try. 11-year old brother wants a pair now. Great price!"
4.0,"Lightweight, not for heavy material.  Good grip, nice looking.  I was satisfied."
4.0,This watch has a nice rubber band and a large face display.
4.0,Adorable suit! Fit a little larger than expected but we will get a few summers out of it. No complaints here. Great quality. Highly recommend.
4.0,"Reef makes good sandals and their bottle openers on the bottle work perfectly. These are different from my last pair in that they are a more leather-esque material that doesn't wear in nearly as quickly as the rubberized foam on my previous ones. Other than that, they're a good sandal."
4.0,This dress is ADORABLE. The large was more comparable to juniors medium.
4.0,much larger than expected...not really good for keys.
4.0,"The solid side is supposed to be rainproof (not verified).  Had a very large crown for me so I made a channel and put elastic in it to tighten it.  Used 1/2 inch elastic since that is the widest I had without shopping.  I'm 5 ft (152.4 cm) tall, so I'm sure there will be times in sunshine I'll fold a part of the brim back so that I can see taller things!  The brim varies from 6 3/8"" - 6 5/8"".  I am hopeful that the wire will keep the brim up & out when the rain comes.  Traveling to some wet places soon."
4.0,This can be worn by anyone. You can wear it anywhere. It is an every day dress that can be used for all kinds of purposes. You will love the pockets and the versatility of the dress.
4.0,9
4.0,A bit clunky...but hard to beat the price.
4.0,Love different combination of colors. And style. Great with leggings.
4.0,It's what my 3 granddaughters are getting for Christmas next year
4.0,It is very see thru so I will be wearing this as a coverup and not a sun dress 😮‍💨
4.0,"The backing is really small so it's difficult to put on.  That's why I didn't rate these a five star.  However, the earrings are the size I wanted and look nice with other earrings and studs."
4.0,"really cool watch happy in every way but one, the hour and min display separate which is fine except it doesn't cycle, if you had the hour show for a few sec then min it be great, its kinda hard to tell time while biking or driving because no cycle, the band is amazing and inventive."
4.0,"It may not be high end but I'm impressed, it works as advertized. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one"
4.0,"I wanted brown ones like these without a bright white stripe on them. These arrive just as pictured. The black has a white stripe, the brown has a khaki stripe, and the khaki has a brown stripe. The fit is great. They are snug but more supportive and not constricting. The length easily is over the knees and the stitching lines up even when stretched. I usually just try one on when I order a pack and examine the others to make certain they'll do. This time the one I tried had a small hole near the footbed by the heel. It's small and all the others were fine because I then checked. The bad thing is it's on the brown pair which I wanted most and my skin shows through drawing attention. I could still wear it but worried it may tear more and I'd like more than one use out of these. I take care and often have items last for years. The best way to put on things like these is to roll the top to the toe in one bunch and then open it up as you're putting on a sock."
4.0,"Pretty decent quality, not as plush as i'd hoped."
4.0,I love my cat ring! It's awesome! The only problem I have is my finger turns green & it makes my finger itchy :-( but it's not real so of course it will probably do that. But I love the look of the ring it is so cute & fits perfect on my first finger. It will fit in perfectly with me 😜
4.0,"This wasn't quite the material I was expecting. It's cotton... I'm not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't that, but that's totally fine. It fits great, definitely order true to size. Would recommend for anyone looking for something simple; however, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who has a large bust. I'm a 34C and it's barely comfortable on me (as in it cuts into your midline)."
4.0,It still looks nice after a couple of months of wear and sparkles beautifully.
4.0,"Very pretty, good chain length"
4.0,"Bought for my mom with dementia, A bit bigger than I expected, but does well. I like the easy band since it is both stretch and Velcro; no clasps. However, as with most digital watches, there are too many buttons that are not good for someone with dementia. I was able to remove three of the four buttons and only keep the talking button active (removed the button and pins, I can still activate the buttons using a needle/pin)"
4.0,"These work great for what they are, but the raised spots on the sole can be a little uncomfortable at times.  I think your feet must need to be a different shape than mine for those bumps to serve their purpose - if they have one...."
4.0,"Very cute and comfy! Not particularly for the curvier, taller woman but it’s do-able if you order a size up."
4.0,My 10 year old daughter says it looks almost exactly as advertised and she's generally pleased.  She wants everyone to know that it should be worn on top of clothes because the material isn't so comfortable to the skin.
4.0,I work in a warehouse and I use it as an undershirt
4.0,It's different.  I like it!  True to size.
4.0,"okay let me start by saying that overall I like this very much. The material feels very nice, the stitching looks good and well put together. Overall this appears to be a very quality piece. However the thing that I didn't like is that it seems pretty obvious in person that the two sides of the skull, left and right, are printed very differently. The right side as you wear it, left side in the picture, is distinctly darker and/or more faded than the other side. I did not discern that when making the purchase, only when going back and looking at the pictures again can you really see that there is a difference from side to side. But in person, at least in the one that I received, the difference is rather dramatic. But that is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five"
4.0,"My son loved the patterns. A bit thin, but that works well for us because he prefers that! Would definitely buy again"
4.0,"Not as floppy as I had expected and a little small. However, still a very cute hat and served its purpose well!"
4.0,"I ordered the blue birthstone color, but I received the clear. I didn't want to bother about sending it back."
4.0,"I really like Russell hoodies and wanted to try the regular sweatshirt. It seems maybe a bit larger than the same size hoodie but then I usually wear 1 or 2 layers under the hoodie but not the sweatshirt.  Arms are long, which most men would probably prefer.  I am a woman with shorter arms than many men, but I usually just do one turn up of the cuffs.  Soft and warm.  Washes well."
4.0,These headbands are cute. We used them for a one-time kickball game to signify which team each kid was on.
4.0,"Really great for the price, received lots of compliments."
4.0,"I bought these for my 9 year old son.  He loves them.  They have withstood his abuse for the last few weeks, so must be decent quality."
4.0,"Gorgeous, reason for 4 instead of 5 is only that they were smaller than expected."
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because the black looked speckled in the picture but is pure black in person which is fine! Just looks different than advertised. But I love this for layering it’s thin with cute detailing on the bottom
4.0,"Arrived earlier than expected, which was nice, and it was of a nice material. Not a crop top, which isn’t too much of a problem since it’s still cute. I wish I had gotten the XL because I personally like a baggy shirt but it still fit nicely on me. I’m 5’6 and about 143 lb for reference"
4.0,"Nice blue jacket. A little big, but good for sweater layering."
4.0,"Lined bodice, color"
4.0,"the material looks cheap but still good for the price. and the colors for the nude are not as showed in the pictures. its more pinky actually . but overall , the purchase is still a good price quality deal."
4.0,"Well made, ggod logos"
4.0,"I think it runs true to size. I’m normally a 10 but I ordered the 12 (xl) and it’s actually a little roomy on the top. It wraps up - chest not out. I’m 5,9’ 170 36C. The pattern is beautiful the quality is nice for the price. Bought it for a bridal shower and to possibly have on hand for wedding season. Looks great with heels."
4.0,I'm short and this is simply pants on me. I think it still looks good.
4.0,It's little irritated my skin. Pretty though
4.0,Irish Green to represent Eire!
4.0,This is a economical garment bag.  I use it to transport my business suit to and from the hotel while working on the road.  I have used it in the rain and in the snow and the garments inside remain dry.
4.0,It's very practical and nice.
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I bought the biggest size there is. I usually buy L or XL when I buy clothes in stores. I'm 6 foot 2 and quite wide. So I was a little concerned. But it fits me well! Don't know how insulating it is because it's still Summer. But I'll update my review in winter when I actually have to wear it."
4.0,"Metal is a bit thin/flimsy so I'd be careful ordering for children, but I still love the colors/style."
4.0,I like this dress. I wear it with a vest because it WILL cling to the parts of your body you don't want it to (whatever isn't flat).
4.0,"Quality is there .. sizing could use some work. I travel to Alaska quite regularly so layering is important on those frigid winter days. I read the reviews and ordered up, They fit snugly in waist area and baggy in hip area. I will keep these for those not so frigid day outings but will still search for those perfect fit snow pants."
4.0,"Bought 2 pair for my daughters and they liked the softness and coziness of the pajama.  I should have probably ordered a size larger so that my daughter could have grown into them but; unfortunately did not do it.  The next ones I purchase will definitely be a little larger.  All my children have their birthdays at the end of the year and so the little growth spurts come around this time.  Besides that; the colors are beautiful and the material is super soft, just what we needed."
4.0,"4/5 only because the mesh seam on the side of shorts is already beginning to tear...Besides that the material is comfortable, lightweight, and stretchy. Black color runs smaller than the grey just an FYI. I’m 5’2, 133 pounds with curvy hips. Size Medium suited me well in both colors!"
4.0,very pleased with purchase!
4.0,"Love this set! Really cute and fits great, I would have sized up for a little more laxed fit next time since the material isn't very stretchy."
4.0,Great for a friendship bracelet
4.0,Nice! The blouse is just a little large so I am going to keep it. Wonderful price! Thanks!
4.0,This is a good ninja costume for kids. It’s exactly as pictured except the belt is a lot thinner. It was difficult to pull over the head and I had to stretch it out a bit to pull it over but we got it and he said it was comfortable. The size is exact but it’s a thin material so you might need to layer. Overall it’s a good costume for the price.
4.0,Everyone loved it and was asking where we got it...
4.0,"The pants is very comfortable and the quality is great, but it just runs a bit too long even though I got the size I usually always wear. It is very stretchy and relaxed."
4.0,"The cloth is a lot bigger than I expected, this is a very large cloth and shines bigger silver products. I got this to clean my jewelry and it does it's job!"
4.0,"I love 90 Degree by Reflex yoga pants (they're the best quality available for the price), but the printed pairs seem to fit differently than the solid pants for some reason. Maybe it's just the paris I've ordered/received, but I've consistently found that these run a little small and had to exchange them for mediums. Once you find the right fit, though, they're perfect - they're really comfortable, stand up great to wear, are not see-through at all, and are awesome whether you're in the gym or hanging out."
4.0,The jeans fit as expected. The are nice quality.  My daughter wears 9-10 jeans and these fit good.
4.0,"I loved these. The fabric is fantastic! I am 5''7"" and 210, I carry it in my tummy.  I purchased a 3x. They were long enough, it was so nice to see. However, very slim cut in the legs. I looked like a tomato with two toothpicks for legs. Not flattering. Everything else was five star. Hope this is helpful,, because I hated returning them."
4.0,"Definitely get what you pay for, however they have been a great deterrent"
4.0,Moisture wicking
4.0,The Elite Gi feel really comfortable yet sturdy at the same time.  The stitching is neatly done.  It feels really light weight.  The color looks really nice better than I expected.
4.0,"Overall the top is cute. I got the brown/ ""black"" stripe in a medium. It's short, and wouldn't cover the areas you'd want to wear it with leggings.  I'm 5'2 And it hit right at mid hip. I think the sleeves would be short on someone with longer arms than me. And its not Brown/black.  It's Brown/blue and that REALLY disappoints me. They need to correct the description.  I got a medium and it is only slightly oversized for my 5'2/140lb structure. The string on the hoodie seems to cheapen it a bit so I may replace it with a cotton string. Worth it, will wear it but disappointed color error."
4.0,"I have bought multiple multiple products from this seller. Overall, I love the product because it is very useful and compact. The only problem I have with this product is that the badge holder falls apart in just few days. This has happened to every single product that I have ordered. That is the only downfall of this product. But if you are looking for a compact and nice card holder, I think it's not bad to give it a try!"
4.0,It was beautiful I just the change wasn't broken when I received it
4.0,"I expected the leg width at the bottom to be narrower. It would help to add this measurement in the description. With tapered leg, I expected not a skinny fit but less than these. Look too boxy on."
4.0,"Nice looking, flexible, very soft inside (no problem going sock-less), but a little narrow in the toebox (I like to be able to wiggle my toes a little bit when wearing footwear).  I chose the midnight blue/navy canvas to replace my old Vans.  The UGGs are super expensive (who would pay $100 for a pair of canvas sneakers??!---I guess I would, and did), but I have owned UGG brand before and have no issues with quality or comfort.  I guess there's a premium for tried-and-true products.  I rated these sneakers a 4 (not the seller, the seller is a FIVE hands down) because of the narrow toebox, which is slightly disappointing, but I can live with the very minor discomfort of not being able to wiggle my toes."
4.0,Exactly as described. Delivered in a cute little cloth bag.
4.0,"Although the stripes are a little crooked, this is just a fun dress to wear.  It fits well, has just the right amount of stretch to make moving easy and received a lot of compliments!"
4.0,"Like most peplum tops lately, this flares out above my natural waist. I am only 5'2"" and I am short wasted. I think anyone over 5' tall would not like this top. Also, the narrow stripe pattern killed my eyes. This was seriously painful to look at in real life."
4.0,Fits like a compression sock. Not as tight as TEDS. Seem to shrink in dryer.
4.0,"The fit is great except it’s not as long as expected. I’m 5’2” and I do not have a long torso, so it was surprising how short it was. Other than that, the fabric, color and softness are perfect."
4.0,Worked well as a pirate shirt.
4.0,Fabric and fit were good. The sleeves had a weird poof at the top that was awkward no matter how I wore it.  Otherwise a great flattering fit.
4.0,The long white gloves give my costume a nice touch & I'm very pleased w/price.
4.0,"Pretty good wallet especially for the price, and the RFID blocking really does seem to work. Not the thinnest or smallest of wallets though, it's about what you'd expect from a conventional wallet. It can get somewhat thick if you use all of the card slots, and the overall footprint is about as big as it can be while still riding comfortably in a front pocket.<br /><br />For personal taste, this wallet would get 5 stars if it was about 10-15% smaller in overall dimensions, had only half of the card slots, and an ID window instead of the other 3 card slots."
4.0,"The gowns are pretty and fortunately did not shrink as the body is narrower than other gowns of this type I have purchased.  The elastic in the sleeve is quite tight, but that''s not a big problem. A little more fullness in the width of the gown would have made this a great item. Also, it is on the short side."
4.0,"I love the shirt, but for an XXL - a size I normally wear - it is much too small. I can put it on, but I look like a sausage ready to pop. I don'the plan on losing weight so I can'tell wear it, but maybe I will find someone who can wear it."
4.0,"Love this top!  I bought a large, it fits great in the arms and chest area. It does hang a little long in the front and back. Fast shipping."
4.0,Dri fit ☺️
4.0,My feet are size 7.5 and these fit nicely but definitely has enough room for size 9s. It's well made and the stretch bands keep it from rolling down.<br />Absolutely cute and works with my mary janes but it's slightly too thin for my liking though. You might need to double up on socks if wearing hard shoes.
4.0,"Nice, but just a bit too much material for me. I'm 5'4&#34; and wear a 16. The XL fit great but the style overwhelmed me. The material is nice though. Not see through.  Totally worth the price."
4.0,Nice quality shorts however run a little small too me
4.0,These were very cute!! They fit just fine.
4.0,Works well. Seems to work better if you let it sit more than the 20 seconds recommended in the instructions before wiping. And very important not to wipe hard.
4.0,"This can be used for so many things from newborn and up.My 20 month old and I dance with them,tie them together and stuff them inside an old wipe box and she will pull each one out,over and over.My 5 year old has used it as a cape for one of her""characters""<br />Really is well made,strong and a great gift to any childs imagination!<br />The only down side was that I thought that there would be more when I got them.This price listed is just for one silk.I did think I was going to get at least more than one,however still a great product!"
4.0,"I’ve worn it a few times and it is getting pilling.  Otherwise,  it is comfy and I get compliments on it."
4.0,Really good...my daughter is loving it
4.0,They are great I need plan clamshell without bra therefore I need to return them.
4.0,"This hat is very high quality and looks great.  I took off a star simply because it's a tiny bit smaller than I'd like, but I do have a full size adult head.  I would say this product is probably more intended for teens, which wan't stated anywhere on the ad.  I still wear it though and it looks good, just not quite as comfortable as I would have liked."
4.0,"sizing was accurate, well made, does tend to get small snags easily. perfect for 50s party"
4.0,Returned because I didn't like the color combination. Would have preferred navy and white.
4.0,Unfortunately I brought the wrong size. So I returned the ring
4.0,"I folllwed the reviews and sized up. I normally wear a medium and got the extra large. I am 5’6 and 135 and the extra large fit just right, even occasionally a bit snug, so if you want them to just rest on the waist without digging into your tummy maybe even get an XXL. But I love them and my friends love them! I call them my crazy pants. When you are walking into the wind literally everything but your lady bits is exposed so if you want to show off your legs these pants are it."
4.0,"Nice material, beautiful color, but the shirt kept rising so I had to continue pulling down that part of the shirt. It was still cute and I loved the double straps in the back."
4.0,"Anyone who has owned an F-91w knows it a a great watch so I will only talk about the differences compared to a standard F-91w. First the watch band. It is slightly darker than it appears in the amazon picture (see my picture) but overall looks good. It does however feel significantly different to the standard F-91w. It is much less flexible and as a result, it's less comfortable. It is also glossy which causes some annoying squeaks against the buckle and case. It might go away over time as the band wears down, but it thought I should mention it. My biggest complaint however is with the case. Instead of making it transparent grey like the band, they just painted it gray. It looks ok in some lights and really bad in others. I know it would cost more to make the case translucent, but it would have made it look way better. It's not a bad watch which is why I'm still giving it 4 stars, but especially for $25 I was expecting a bit more. If it ever drops to 10-15$ like most other F-91w's than it might be worth it but at the current price I would skip it."
4.0,"Lovely fabric and well made. My 8yr old is 56” tall and weighs 54lbs. The size 8 fit her, but was slightly shorter than I would have preferred. She loves it though, and it is lovely for Easter."
4.0,"Pretty! the lace is fabric, making it form to your neck easily."
4.0,The tights were for my 12 year old daughter and she is 5'3&#34; and 115 lbs and they fit her fine thought they only come up to her knee not over the knee like the picture shoes. I would think to make them fit over the knee like that one would have to have tiny thin legs and probably 100 or less lbs.
4.0,it serves its purpose...like that the sleeves gives maximum coverage for my arms
4.0,Love this case but took some time and quite a few emails to the seller to get here. Worth it in the end for a good quality case.
4.0,"meets expectations, but a bit to wide for typical trouser hip pocket.  Makes it a bit difficult to extract.  good for thwarting pick-pockets, though!"
4.0,"I like this set of three gloves. I like the colors, they feel warm and fit well."
4.0,"Nice casual dress, comfy material, just a little sheer."
4.0,It had plenty of room for everyday items and was easy to use with multiple pockets for various items. It is well designed.
4.0,"They fit well, are really comfortable to wear and are very warm.  They are basically nice, loose winter socks with non-slip pads on the soles.  Great alternative to Slippers!"
4.0,Came is a nice case and in good shape.
4.0,"I like it, it's easy to wear and the pockets are great. Very comfy and washes easily ,air dries quickly. Can be dressed up or down."
4.0,My son loved this but you have to go 3 sizes up.<br />He's 5'7 140lbs and xl was too short in arms.<br />But great quality otherwise.
4.0,"Very slim fit, not skin hugging slim, but I bought sz38 instead of 36 and gives me plenty of space in my man area, and loose around legs. If your a guy into colors and Not giving a crap what basic dudes think of your bright and experimental dress code then WHY NOT get some tropical slacks. These slacks are super comfortable and has some stretch to it. Honestly women give me compliments in these all the time, cuz they appreciate a guy who thinks outside the fashion box 📦.  SSLR clothing is durable and truly affordable, especially when all my money goes into jordans. Okay buy with confidence."
4.0,I did not like the material of the product
4.0,"Fit well, the polarized lens is sufficient for most application.  The plastic the temples are made from are brittle plastic, they will break easily.  Good fit over prescription eyeglasses.  Would give 5 stars, cheap brittle plastic knocked it down, but for 12 bucks who cares."
4.0,sort of peels at the top wings. decent for the price
4.0,"I was surprised at how heavy the bracelets are. Really nice quality and the band's seem durable. The white one is noticeably smaller than the black, so I'm assuming it is meant for the girls wrist, or whoever has the smaller wrist in the duo haha. Would've given 5 stars but with the white, the ends of the plastic band stick out right next to the black bead, which is the side that is always going to be shown. Other than that, really nice! Go with this brand!!!"
4.0,This shirt is perfect for me to wear to work (I'm a toddler teacher) and get lots of compliments. If I ordered again I would get an XXL.
4.0,"Looks great, but turns your skin and socks completely black"
4.0,"My husband blows through socks so fast working in construction. These lasted several months, so they aren't perfect, but he says they are comfortable, and the value is good."
4.0,"I love this dress. Not too thin, the material is nice. I really love the pockets. I think I need a few more in different colors for my summer wardrobe. Don't hesitate, it's a nice dress, and a nice price."
4.0,I'm giving 4 stars for the look and feel of these tights. Only problem is the fit. I ordered what I considered ONE size up from what I would normally buy...should've gone TWO sizes up!
4.0,"So pretty, but not sure how long the gold finish will last. I ordered the grey, but it's more of a grey/green swirl. I love it because I had a hard time deciding between those two colors. But if you are hoping for all grey, be aware it can vary a lot."
4.0,"Got as a gift for a friend and works good, just a little flimsy with the construction."
4.0,"Pretty amazing for the price.  Nice material, loose fit and super cute."
4.0,"Great value or the price.  It's very comfortable.  I would size up at least one if not two sizes if you want a roomy fit.  I went up one and it fits fine, but I wish I had gone up one more."
4.0,This is a great charm.  It is good quality silver and will compliment other Egyptian symbols on my charm bracelet. Will recommend to others.
4.0,I chose a size too big and exchange it for a medium<br />The product  is great for a Halloween costume for sure
4.0,"Cute little dress.  I will get use out of it this Summer.  It will be great to run errands in, on the beach and dress it up to go right into evening."
4.0,Normally wear a 14/16 bought the XL. I wear a 36DDD and the chest area is a little short and I am 5'8&#34; and it hits several inches above my knee. Material is a little thin but doesn't seem to be see through. A little disappointed cause I was buying it for work but the length is not really work appropriate. Will still make a nice dress to wear out.
4.0,This is the first an only sports bra I can squeeze my 34G chest into.  But it looks and feels great.  I primarily use for lounging and yoga but have also worn during cardio. Excellent support for the price!  No more $150 sports bras for me!
4.0,"These are soft and cute. The heart is sewn a little bit funny, but nobody would prob notice."
4.0,The added LED lights are not perfectly aligned all the way around. The driver is okay as well.
4.0,Was a cute dress and great gift!
4.0,Pretty pink
4.0,"I like the material and the modest styling of the skirt. But it is a little too long for me, so it looks more conservative than the model picture. I am 5'5 and it comes almost to my knees. Also,  the pockets under the skirt are at a funny angle for tennis balls, so not that great for tennis - I guess it's sold as a golf skirt as well."
4.0,"I feel this is probably a &#34;true to size&#34; shirt so I probably should have ordered a medium because the small is a little tight - however, it still fights. Love the print, love the shirt and I especially love the hood on it!"
4.0,"I’m 5’6, 36C, 28 waist, 34 hips. Size 6 pants, size small leggings. I looked at their size chart and went with a medium, expecting an oversized fit. Well as you can see from the pics the medium 8-10 isn’t oversized. It’s a relaxed fit. The sleeves don’t even reach all the way down to my hands. So I’d have to say this set runs small. That being said, it still fits me, like a small would, and is a relaxed comfortable fit. The material is thin and lightweight. I do like the set, but I would suggest ordering up a size for a relaxed fit and up 2 for an oversized fit."
4.0,"Not cotton. The description claims it is 100% AND 65% cotton, so I knew I was gambling on material. In fact it is not cotton at all.<br />The tag says: 65% rayon 35% Polyester.<br /><br />But this is a lovely top. Fit is quite large though.<br />I'm usually a small (5'4&#34; 115lbs, small chested) but was a little worried it might be cut small. I had to return the medium because I was swimming in it. (should have gone with my regular sizing). I'm not sure if I will trust a small to be enough smaller to fit me as it's meant to.<br /><br />Also, the color is a much richer purplier red than pictured. Quite lovely."
4.0,"Great, inexpensive option if you're looking for a large 'Celine-like' pair of black sunnies.  A little goofy in how large and plasticy they are but I really like them!"
4.0,Restricts how much you can move your head before pulling down.
4.0,"I know a few people that wear something like this and they said it has actually helped their posture while allowing them to not look so overweight. When I was offered to be able to buy one at a sharp discount, I figured why not see if it would work for me.<br /><br />I was able to wear it under most type of clothes, except for certain t-shirts. It was comfortable for most of the day, although I do find myself removing it in the afternoon just because it became to tight after lots of movement throughout the day. I don't think it made me any thinner after wearing it for a week, but I found myself standing up with better posture as well as being able to sit at a desk for longer periods of time without lower back pain that I get at times. And don't worry about any odors as I could wear it for almost a week and it barely smelled."
4.0,Love the bathing suit just wishing I could fit it. Gotta lose some more weight first.
4.0,"Christmas gift.  Seem to run a little small, but did stretch to a nice fit."
4.0,Liked it! Nice scarf!
4.0,I liked them a lot just a bit wide around the ankle.
4.0,"cute, cotton"
4.0,I like the material a lot but I ordered the yellow hoody with black stripes on the side but mine came with white stripes and it looks a bit tacky how do I go ahead and get the correct sweater
4.0,good belt.  price is right.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet. Exactly what I was looking for
4.0,Very nice and of good quality.
4.0,This is a good blouse and I'm happy with the purchase.  Quality material.  I used the size chart but it was still big. But that's not a problem since its meant to be loose and flowy. I make it work with close fitted pants and high heels. But it's also nice with flats. Recommended
4.0,Pros: durable<br />Cons: sticky rubber
4.0,"Overall these are very pretty earrings! The stone looks like a real emerald and has nice clarity despite being an imitation.<br /><br />I will say these are smaller than I expected. The pictures in the description are very distorted and don’t give an idea of their true size, so I was a bit disappointed when I opened the box.<br /><br />I also feel these were a bit overpriced. All other earrings from Cate & Chloe are less than $35, and I was able to find an identical pair from another seller for much less than $99. Maybe the value is truly there, but I am not seeing it.<br /><br />Overall very pretty earrings, but not quite the statement piece I was expecting."
4.0,"I'm very happy I found this for $20! Im 5'4"" & 165lbs. I ordered a medium (instead of my usual large). It fits great! Perfect length. I will say the first elastic is tighter than I'd like (like others have stated). And the fabric isn't the most comfortable, but it's not TOO scratchy either. Over all very excited to wear this to Ren fest this year!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, but avoid wearing these if your feet are at all moist, mine started to stink up something awful within 8 months of usage (mostly worn for an hour in the morning and 2 hours in the evening."
4.0,Loved the shirt- but it did run a little small!
4.0,"had to return it--exactly as all the other reviewers complained: sleeves were way too small, impossible to even get into because of the odd styling.  and I even ordered it a size larger than I normally wear.  it's a shame because the styling is so cool--I truly love the ombre sequins.  they let me keep it rather than making me return it and just refunded the money, always a nice gesture.  it's why I gave it 4 stars--for the vendors' willingness not to compound the disappointment by making me pack it back up, schlep it to the post office, and pay to return it.  if only it had fit...."
4.0,The green is darker than pictured. Still a fun jacket to have.
4.0,"I bought an xtra large because I wanted it to be big but it fit properly, no extra room. I wear a size medium usually."
4.0,wife loved the design was a Little upset it was tight for the size ordered.
4.0,Great Gift idea
4.0,Love the design but it was a little small. I ordered a medium and from the crotch to the top it was a little tight. I feel like I need to lose like 5lbs and it would fit perfectly.
4.0,"They're not as big as I had hoped for, but they're great quality. Definitely not &#34;cheap&#34;."
4.0,I'm Size 8 and my feet hang off the end. I have to force my feet all the way in to fit. Other than that comfy and cute. Definitely not OSFA
4.0,Beautiful had to take sum links out was a lil big
4.0,"It does look great under shirts, but it doesn't do much for my girls. The cup area is definitely on the smaller side (it's very narrow from top to bottom, so it doesn't cover much or provide any support), so it doesn't do much to enhance my boobs, it makes them look pretty flat and is pretty bumpy around the seams, but the strappy part looks great. I'm a 34B. I ended up trying it over a black push-up bra, and it looked GREAT. The bra added the shape and support I needed, and then this was the decoration."
4.0,"I like the apron, it isn’t very thick and is pretty thin. It’s also pretty small so not sure how long it will last for my 3yo but will fit perfect right now."
4.0,I created a charm necklace of all letter Cs. It turned out quite nice.
4.0,"This is a pretty good workout shirt; I usually wear it for running. The back is burnout material, which makes it nice and breathable. It's a great shirt for layering because you can easily slip a shell over it without becoming too bulky and hot. My one *tiny* complaint is that it can occasionally ride up in front while running, but my chest is on the larger side (32DDD) so shirts riding up isn't totally out of the ordinary for me. Consider a size up if your chest is on the larger side. It's pretty loose-fitting around the bottom, so I wouldn't wear it to yoga unless you like your shirt to fall off in down dog. It works well for most other activities."
4.0,Shirt is a little short in length.
4.0,"I have swollen feet due to water retention. Mostly I wear bedroom slippers. I was delighted to find these so-called diabetic shoes. They give me a wide latitude of opening sizes, with a Velcro strap to narrow the closure. I can almost always get them to fit even when the swelling is at its worst. Furthermore they look like classy brushed suede house shoes. (Still, I wouldn’t consider them dressy enough to be appropriate for outside wear.)<br /><br />If you’ve got swollen feet, buy these. At least give them a try. They worked for me."
4.0,Very cute! I have received a lot of compliments on it. Could be a better quality.
4.0,They were nice but smaller than I expected.
4.0,"I would have given 5 stars except for sizing. Granted, my girl is a young 5, but the 5-7yr size was very loose on the top chest part. I'll fix it with my sewing machine though, because it's a nice thickness and my daughter loves it. Good quality."
4.0,"Pretty great! I wear a 30E and a size small actually fit me. Not great if you need something for high impact, but for yoga or a barre class it's a great option."
4.0,It's okay for the cost.
4.0,"Looks great, comfy fit , nice nsoft for fussy 18 yes old grandson"
4.0,The colors were exactly the same as the pic. They are a bit heavy which is a pro if you want to keep stretching your ears . But overall good quality !
4.0,One of the reasons why I really I really like this set is because my son's father was always a skater kid growing up. So its really sweet to see this on my son and him saying skater kid. I knot this makes his dad happy seeing the shirt and the material is great! The collar feels to be a little elastic so no squeezing the head through it. The shorts are pretty long and I like how it is a different color in white/grey instead of blue/gray or blue/white. The size I ordered was 3 years. My son is is in the 50th percentile for a almost 2 year old so this fit him really well and the length is not long on him. Just a little past his hips. I like the shorts because they have elastic on the waist and did not fall off his waist at all. It is lightweight and easy to put on. I washed it a few times before putting it on him and the color did not fade or stain his other clothes. I received this product for free in exchange of my honest review.
4.0,If you expect for this to be lose fitting like the picture buy a size bigger or 2 even. i bought a large and it was just the right fit. Not lose fitting like i wanted it to be. The material is comfortable and thin but  not see through. I like it a lot actually and the got compliments on the color.
4.0,They work for what I need and they cover my hands which is all I needed.
4.0,Gave them as a gift<br />.
4.0,"Size is not true to fit, get one size bigger"
4.0,Nice bracelet for my teen son but it was a bit too chunky. I returned it.
4.0,"Wish the insoles would be more cushioned. Other than that, cute fit"
4.0,This is a cute shirt we used for a summer camp super hero day.  It's comfortable and creative mask inside the hood.  Satisfied 4 YO customer.
4.0,These rings are very cute and light up nice and bright.  The only problem with the order was that only 18 of the rings lit up.
4.0,The material seems to have a good stretch to it. Comfortable.
4.0,Top fits and looks great. But color fades and looks lighter.
4.0,"Nice value lightweight water-resistant jacket.  A bit slim-fitting for being sold in Big and Tall.  Would not necessarily recommend for everyday wear,  but sufficient for keeping in the car for an rainy day or unexpected travel."
4.0,I bought this as my 'costume' for a Disney Fanatics Club meeting's Princess Ball.  It's as close as I come to dressing up for an event.
4.0,Fit really well...
4.0,"Pretty watch; it looks just like the picture.  I like having all the number show, and Arabic numbers, and the oval shape."
4.0,Nice look and style. Material could be a little better but good fit
4.0,"I bought these earrings because I have multiple piercings in each lobe. If I would’ve given the review earlier it would’ve been 5 stars but I noticed today that I was missing one of the earrings I was wearing. They don’t have metal backs, just the little rubber ones and I think that’s where the issue lies. Otherwise, they’re super cute. Maybe just use metal backs to secure the better."
4.0,bigger than I think
4.0,These were really good quality wings I was pretty happy with the. The elastic to get them on (for an adult) was very tight though. Comfortable enough when on but I needed some help getting them on and off.
4.0,"The thickness is good I enjoy that they are decorative and gives a nice individual style to the mask. However they have a very strong odor, I had to spray them with a scented sanitizer to kill the smell"
4.0,Rey good
4.0,It covers my head. It fits. I think I'm cool.
4.0,"I purchased this as a prop for a class my daughter took, I’m probably going to get my own. It is really excellent quality! Love the dusty baby blue as well."
4.0,I wasn't sure about buying these because the reviews were all over the place but I'd glad I did. I've used them for multiple trips so far and I haven't had any problems with them. The worse thing about them is the protective film that comes on them. It is impossible to get off. It is like the film was applied before the hardware was put on.
4.0,"The only thing to keep in mind is that the black paint wears off quickly if you use it as a fidget toy. Mine wore off in areas after a week. The markings are deeply engraved enough to remain visible but they will wear off with heavy use as with any engraved ring. You can restore the black lettering by going over the ring with a small paint brush or paint pen, and then wiping the excess off. Had the lettering been powder baked, I'd have rated it a 5. Photo is of a different ring by the same company but the worn paint issue is the same. Think of this as an inexpensivr toy and not serious jewelry."
4.0,"I'm 5'6 180lbs and wear size 10-12 depends on how they're made.<br />  I ordered a L which I believe was 12-14.<br /><br />All um gonna say is u get what u pay for.<br /> Material is thin blue jean and they are slightly snug around the waist.<br />These jeans are made to fit Asian women, next time I'll know when I buy their pants to order little larger size up."
4.0,I love this product they fit great and look even better
4.0,Very nice. Will fill the need I have for purchasing the skirt. Will have to trim top layer — a little too long.
4.0,Nice men's dress socks. The colors a bright and vibrant. The only down side is that the socks are on the thin side. I am afraid that they will get holes after not too much wear.
4.0,"XL was super long and loose. I thought these would have a little more compression to them, but they don't, so buy on the smaller size"
4.0,Recently went on an international trip that included six baggage checking in and recovering the bag.  The tag was very recognizable and caused all traveling in the group to chuckle.  I think others on our tour group will purchase.
4.0,"It did not fit as expected, but it works. :-)"
4.0,Too big for my infant. I'll do 3 or 4 month photos in it. Good quality.
4.0,I love toe socks! I bought them just to walk around in the house with. They are thin and don't suffocate my feet. I love the colors they came in and they were packaged very nicely. I will have to get used to the non slip grips. They feel funny under my feet.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1f7dbbb2f361f4b2b75c0352e540c171]]
4.0,Nice shirt would recommend
4.0,"This is a great shirt but I don’t understand why this photo is used, as it’s deceptive. This picture indicates the printing will be all white and some blue when it’s not; it’s yellow, green, white and pink. I’m glad a previous reviewer pointed this out. If the picture got changed I would give it 5 Stars."
4.0,"These are some of the comfiest workout leggings I own. They aren’t see through but I haven’t tried the squat test yet. I’m 5’7, 220 normally a size 14 and they fit just fine. They can be very hot and are not sweat proof but if you’re not planning on sweating in them a lot then you should be fine."
4.0,"Way bigger than I had thought, still super cute"
4.0,I love it! Besides I thought it was black in the picture but I guess that’s on me for not reading a little more. Is very lovely but I should have got a small but I thought it might come snug so I got a medium and it was a little big needs to be a little tighter in a few areas. But besides that it just about perfect
4.0,Very cute! A different closure would be nice... my five year old needs help getting it off and on. It’s is not as long in the torso as I’d hope... but still works and looks adorable!
4.0,Handy set up spring bars to have on hand if you have several different size watches
4.0,"It is really pretty, but it does slide around."
4.0,"The fabric is ok, more spandex than I expected. I thought they were going to be butter soft T-shirt material. There cuteness makes up for the different fabric!"
4.0,"Cute shirt, but fits small. Order a size up."
4.0,"Returning because it’s kind of like a mumu. Not flattering at all on me. I was expecting more of a fit and flare, but it’s just flared. Made me look huge."
4.0,"Fits but one of those leggings that won't stay up when Jumping , or running .."
4.0,I got this for my 13 year old daughter.  The size 5 ring is sized correctly. The quality and value of this ring are both amazing.  Really happy with this purchase.
4.0,I WAS LOOKING FOR EARRINGS TO USE IN MY UPPER PART OF MY EAR LOBE. THEY'RE PERFECT. NOT TOO LARGE OR SMALL. AND THE PRICE WAS LESS THAN OFFERED BY NUMEROUS JEWELRY SITES.
4.0,fits good length is perfect its just  the upper arm band maybe to tight not so much that blood flow is effected  time to time I get a pinching  skin in the upper inner biceps  in an 8hr wk day have to adjust with finger appro.3 times not enough to keep me from wearing em
4.0,"Love the look. Love that the bill folds for ease of storage, hence, &#34;pocket hat.&#34; It ran a little big for me, but does the job to tame my hair on days I jut want to quickly run out of the house. My husband loves his too."
4.0,looks of item
4.0,Great quality for such a low price.  Not much more $ than a cheap Halloween costume wig that was absolute junk
4.0,It's a cheap knock off to what you find at dept. stores. I have nothing else to say but I have to type...
4.0,"Super cute and soft! I ordered size 0-3 for my 2 month old and it's pretty big on him (he's large for his age too). I would give it 5 stars, but there was a stain on one of the legs when I got it. I'd exchange it, but I'm afraid I won't get the replacement in time for Halloween."
4.0,"Very pretty top. Nice quality and flattering.  The only con is that it's a bit snug in the chest/arm pit area. It's like it's NOT cut for ""women's size"", but more like ""juniors size"". As long as you are not stretching your shoulders/arms back, you won't even notice. 😉"
4.0,"I got these for my nephew, who absolutely adores them. They are soft and have a nice cushion on the inside. These slippers have hard soles with cute bears on the soles themselves. They do seem to run a bit small, as I got a size larger than what my nephew needed and they fit perfectly. I would definitely recommend these to anyone with a kid who wants a comfortable pair of slippers, just make sure to order a size up!"
4.0,"Great sweat pants , for the price they are very comfortable for the gym , great fit , I'm likely going to buy a few more."
4.0,Great 🎃 Halloween accessories for thing one
4.0,"The regular sized masks don't fit well on my fat face, but these were too big."
4.0,"Ordered this special made from my own creation. .. Not disappointed... It does run big, at least for me, because I usually take a small, but am never sure how they will run, so always go with a bigger size."
4.0,"i have several Breitlings and needed a reliable winder that was big enough to fit my watches, this one works great!1"
4.0,really nice suit except that the top was a little big for me and will need to have the straps shortened.  The bottom fits like a glove!  I ordered a size medium.  I am 5'4&#34; and weigh 122 lbs.
4.0,"I am a 38DD and wear a large/XL shirt.  I bought this in a large.  Though it fit over my head and onto me, it was so tight in the bust it smashed my boobs in like pancakes.  I wish this came in a bigger size and I would buy it.  If you are smaller chested, this is a very pretty top."
4.0,Beautiful bracelet!  Just wish it was a larger size.  Meant for smaller wrists.
4.0,On the small side but worth the price.
4.0,"Shirt looks great in person and the material is good quality. However this shirt is very fitted, not lose like pictured. I recommend going up a size."
4.0,it's a robe. the drawstrings feel a little flimsy but overall good quality.
4.0,"I didn't read carefully, and these are tiny! The fabric is nice though, and I'll use it up. Next time I'll double-check the size. :)"
4.0,"Color looks brown antique as pictured (octopus).  Chain is really long, like 24&#34;.  Will try to find a leather cord closer to 16&#34;."
4.0,Had to buy a second one don’t understand the difference between 7 and 8 dollars as both only driver one piece
4.0,Very cute hat. Thank goodness for the Star Wars Logo
4.0,I love them..great purchase 😁
4.0,cute little box for when i get around to proposing
4.0,These are warm fit perfectly. Only problem is it blocks all sound so I have to remove them when having a conversation.
4.0,"i will reorder in a Larger size, it was a bit snug but very soft shirt!"
4.0,"Decent, large fit. Good collar and material"
4.0,"I purchased this brand over the others because they made the smaller 30cm size. Perfect size for me! The leather is soft and seems of good quality. However, i do nitpick and I feel stitching is bad on strap and imperfect near handles. Also, the handles seem a bit puckered  where they attached to the bag. I don’t like that.<br /> Otherwise this looks very close to the name brand.  I will still keep it and carry it .  Perhaps the handles may straighten out. Bonus, it did come with a  linen pouch  that contains the strap. This seems like a nice linen pouch to  use for anything you wish."
4.0,"Flattering cut. Better than expected.<br />As another purchaser mentioned, the neckline is not quite centered but it's not very noticeable.<br />I wear it with a crinoline so it shows off the skirt nicely."
4.0,Pretty watch but thought it was a little bigger
4.0,"Love these yoga pants! Would be 5 stars if they were a little thicker  (I don't like having to worry about panty lines!). But they wash and wear well and the length is perfect. The color is more of blue-gray than a true navy, but I like it a lot."
4.0,"This is by far the best pair of shades I've ever seen up close, but it does stink that they're slightly bigger than my face which causes them to constantly slide off. It bothers me to a certain degree to have to constantly push them up on my face, but again they still look awesome."
4.0,"This top is very much what I was looking for, very nice material it feels super nice. I love it!"
4.0,It didn't glow very bright. But the moon is a good size.
4.0,Sizes somewhat inconsistent. Bought 2 of these rings. Beautiful ring!
4.0,My husband works in heating an air so he needed something non-conductive. He seems to like them.
4.0,"I ordered the extra large because I am plus sized. I wear a 2X in tops and 18/20 in pants.<br /><br /> A little bit top heavy, so I wanted to make sure I could button the buttons over my boobs.<br /><br /> If you are a plus sized man or woman, the XL onesie will fit you perfectly.<br />I do believe however, if you are 300 or more pounds it might not fit as well, or at all.<br />That's why I gave you my sizes.<br /><br /> The fit is very good.<br />I am 5&#34;3 tall, so the legs of the onesie go right down to my ankles.<br />The ankles on the onesie are elasticized.<br />The legs are not as baggy as the rest of the onesie.<br />So it's kind of funny. it looks like you have these little stick legs, and from your hips up everything is so big and baggy..lol<br /><br /> You can either Unbutton it to use the bathroom, or use the zipper in the back.<br /> I tried the zipper method. it's quick and easy, and you are given enough room, to do what you have to do.<br /><br />The body part of the onesie is quite large and baggy.<br />The only thing I noticed is there is a little bit of gapping in between each button.<br /><br /> I usually wear a T-shirt or tank top underneath my onesie, so I just leave it unbuttoned on the top.<br /><br />But if I wanted to wear it out as a costume, I would have to pin on the inside to eliminate the gapping.<br /><br /> The arms are comfortable. They were not tight or constricting.<br /><br /> The hood/head part is what really makes the costume cute. I absolutely love the yellow unicorn Horn, the eyes, etc. that's the part that attracts all of the attention. Also the tail is cute too LOL<br /><br /> If I fall asleep in it I do wake up quite warm in the middle of the night.<br /> It seems kind of thin, but when you are under the blankets, you do remain warm.<br /><br />I also love to wear it after I am home.<br /> I am settling in for the night, I get on my computer, Blog, etc. it's perfect.<br /><br /> The price was 29.99 . I was looking at a few other styles on Amazon. There is one popular brand of onesies that start at $60 each.<br />So not only did I save 30+ dollars, I received this in two days, and everything about it is pretty much perfect and what I wanted it to be .<br /><br />PS I chose the blue unicorn style"
4.0,"The dress is very pretty. A little short due to the design/cut outs. I will wear black tights with it. For reference, I ordered a Large and I am a 38 bust, 32 waist and weigh 170."
4.0,"I knew these would run small, so I took a chance. I ordered a xs for my 10 year old daughter.  It fits her perfectly and looks so cute.  This fits her style, and she absolutely loves it.  It seems to be well made too.  I ordered blue, and I think I will order another color soon."
4.0,"I normally take a Large, but I listen to the reviews and sizes up to XL. Great decision! (I’m 6’&190lbs) I would give it a 5 star but for me it fits funny under the arms. Even sizing up it rubs at the armpit area & everywhere else it fits great. They’re a good looking shirt & Great Price!"
4.0,I like the hat. Nice fleece lining. Funny part is I ordered this one and one other. This one had to ship from China and the other was instock at Amazon. The one from China arrived before the one from the US. I used the same shipping method. So if you think ordering one and its shipping from China? Go ahead and order it.
4.0,"It would cost me more to make these than to buy them. It is a great price. However, the clips are not all glued on evenly and I had to fix a few with my hot glue gun. All of the bows look great and there is a good selection of colors to attach to a headband or clip in hair"
4.0,"These just came in the mail. They seem very sturdy compared to what you typically get for this price point. HOWEVER...<br /><br />...if you're getting Gold, Brown/1106 and expecting it to be a true ""gold"" color like RayBans are...don't. It's closer to a rose-gold than an actual Gold color. That was very disappointing because I find that color to be closer to the feminine side. Even the nose rests seem almost pink. This would have been 5 stars if the color was more accurate to Gold. Message to the seller, please make a true gold one and I will be your first customer.<br /><br />Other than that, seems to be a good purchase."
4.0,"This set is very very cute! It’s cheap, & as a result it’s not the best quality, but it’s still durable and looks good. The straps on the top are adjustable so you don’t have to worry about it being too high up/low. I would buy again in other colors!"
4.0,Great price. Great product and super fast shipping.
4.0,Very cute. The quality seems to be fair. I don't think it would hold up to daily wear. Occasional wear would probably be fine. I ordered this for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. I was offered a discount in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, fit perfectly, great price, arrived quickly but should not be shipped squooshed in a bag.  We couldn't get the wrinkles out of the tulle."
4.0,Took forever to ship but these are SO cute and they stay on well
4.0,"Was very promising, stayed on and seemed comfy but frame snapped without crazy impact. I'm glad my 2-year-old didn't get hurt.<br />Edit:  upon contacting customer service they gave us full refund however I am still not reordering"
4.0,"I love these shirts, they’re great. Colors are slightly off from the description & pictures though. (That’s why 4 stars not 5.) For example, I just ordered the black & it’s more like navy blue. I was bummed about that as I love black, plus the description said black. However, they’re beautiful, flattering shifts & I’ll probably end up with one of every color before too long :)"
4.0,"I do  love the dress. but seems to run a little small.  Some other reviews mention that the dress runs large, i got my normal size, when i try it on i found out that my waist and chest feel really tight. I have to ask somebody to close the zipper for me. Material feels comfortable."
4.0,Cool shirt. Fits large though and I tried to shrink and didn’t work
4.0,"Solid bottles that don't leak. Just what I needed. the price is slightly high. The bag that comes with it , not so good. They do include a small spatula but no small container to use it with."
4.0,"Keeping the price in mind this was a great value, very striking piece"
4.0,"The corset fit well and I loved the look. The only bummer is that one of the steel wires popped out of the corset like a broken bra wire after one use.  I don't think the stitching was top notch or maybe it was just a weak stitch. I will have to reinforce the stitching before wearing it a second time. However, the price of the corset was worth it."
4.0,"It's multicolored and translucent as advertised and sturdy as well! The one thing I did not see well in the online photos was that the stitching of the plastic was outside, not in, so you can see the bag stitching around the rim of the heart."
4.0,"Ordered a large because asian sizes but was wayyy too long. Could be a dress. I'm 5'2&#34;. Nice fabric, though.<br /><br />UPDATE: Moving to 4 stars because Allegra K contacted me and addressed my issues with the shirt. Great customer service."
4.0,Love the variety of colors. Came on time.
4.0,"Silky soft and very beautiful. I've had it for two years and it's coming apart all over, so I'll have to replace it. I've worn it often so I'm not too disappointed that it hasn't held up. Too bad the price has doubled in the past two years."
4.0,Didn't realize the wrist on the sleeve was tighter half way to the elbow. It was tighter more fitting
4.0,"Good quality wood arms and frames. Lenses are very clear with good polarization as well. The only detracting aspects for me are the lack of springs in the hinge, and the logo that is laminated on the top of the wearer's right lens (which is visible and somewhat distracting whenever the left eye rolls up to view something."
4.0,"I just wish I could have adjusted the straps. It was like one inch too big on the straps part. I made do for the night with some safety pins, but that would have been helpful."
4.0,"Fits my Aviators. Zipper feels a bit cheap, so we will have to see how it holds up.  Not crush proof, but strong enough to protect the glasses with normal use.  Clip is plastic."
4.0,"A gift for the hubster, who wears vests under his winter coat. This is well made and warm."
4.0,Whether I miss read the sizing or my grandson’s foot is too big this Slipper is not for him. Most likely it was my inability to read the size charts.
4.0,"Very cute sturdy bag,True to color. Holds basic items cell phone keys money cards and or lipstick"
4.0,I love it and it's really cute but it arrived without the necklaces attached on one side. There wasn't even a jump ring in the package like it had ever been together. It was an easy fix for me but if you don't have jump rings on hand it wouldn't be as easy.
4.0,"I love this skirt! I had to return and order it again though because my true to size was too small. I love the layers of fabric but the shell did shrink after washing it, no biggie though since you can't see it. I'm probably going to get another color for fall."
4.0,Not what I wanted but nice
4.0,"fit well,great colors"
4.0,Overall good. In my opinion look a bit clumsy. But it maybe only me - I like perfect fit to the leg. But they really look great
4.0,"This was a gift for someone else.  Beautiful rose quartz color, not too light.  I wish I bought one for myself."
4.0,"Nice earring; smaller than I expected, but well-made."
4.0,Glad it came with 2. The first one popped off and was never seen again lol gotta make sure you screw it on completely. I love the flexibility of it after having the original piercing jewelry in for 6 week. Much more comfortable than metal.
4.0,"My daughter had a hard time believing this was a nightgown when I gave it to her, and when I took a second look I understood her position.  The combination of the style, the print, and the fabric makes it entirely possible to wear this as a beach cover up or even a casual dress. The fabric is 90% polyester and 10% rayon. Presumably the rayon is the reason the care instructions prohibit tumble drying. This is the only flaw in what is otherwise an almost carefree choice for summer dressing."
4.0,"My order came quickly and was well packaged.<br />I purchased this purse because it was the closest thing to what I was looking for, though not perfect.<br />The side that has two zipper compartments, might be better if it were only one, they are shallow.<br />I prefer nickel or silver hardware to gold, but did not find that in my price range. I am not sure I like the reverse side of the strap, it cheapens the overall look, will see how it holds up.<br />The interior pockets help organize all my stuff, I do like that it has the swivel ends on the strap, that is something I was looking for."
4.0,great dress is wonderful  for every occasion.
4.0,"These are not the best choice for your first hole because they are so small, but they are very lovely all the same.  I like the comfort of the huggie hoops because you can even sleep in them.  These are not exception.  Be sure you know just how small these are before you click the buy now button. They are nice even if so small."
4.0,"Love these dresses, I keep buying them in different colors."
4.0,My daughter wears 5T for most shoes. We ordered 5-6T size and it fits little bigger so I think they are true to size. The material is pretty soft so my daughter did not feel any discomfort. Also it does not slip on our hardwood floor so i think it is safe.
4.0,These shorts are awesome! They make your butt look incredible. They are high wasted like is pictured.
4.0,Excellent and received as expected as I can see in add
4.0,Love everything except sizing.
4.0,It was a bit lighter material then I expected. I can ware a long sleeve shirt under it  comfortably. So I decided to keep it. It will be nice in the spring and into the summer for a lighter cover up in the warmer temperatures.
4.0,It is good quality. I would order up for because I would like it a little loose other pajamas I bought when Amazon extra large was fine I just find these a little tighter but very nice
4.0,Holding up quite well so far.  All the slots are adequately sized and it flattens out nicely after use.  Crest is a bit wiggly but doesn't appear inclined to go anywhere.
4.0,It's a little see through.
4.0,"I ordered this in light blue. I ordered size medium which is my typical top size.<br /><br />The sweater looks as shown in picture. While on the model it is being shown worn without an undershirt, I think you will need to have something under it.<br /><br />The sweater fits loose which makes it easy to open in the front with movement. Maybe if I ordered it in a size small it would fit “tighter” which may mean it wouldn’t open up.<br /><br />But I do think size medium is the right size for me. Even on the model it looks loose. I don’t know. I will definitely wear a camisole or something under it.<br /><br />I really like the tie in the front which helps with the fit and adds to the style.<br /><br />Overall I do like the way it looks. I can tell it will keep me warm once weather turns cooler.<br /><br />Would recommend."
4.0,I ordered it for Christmas for my sister. She liked it and said it was pretty. The only drawback was that she &#34;wasn't sure it matched anything&#34; in her wardrobe.
4.0,Nice quality and very pretty. Got this for my daughter as a memory/keepsake when her Nana passed away.<br /><br />There is no plastic protector for the photo that comes with this. So I had to print a heart template to cut out the photos and them use double sided tape to hold them in place.<br />It worked fine but the photo protector would have saved me about 40 minutes of getting the right size photo in their.<br />I would buy it again based on the quality and price.
4.0,This is a cute top. Fit as expected on all ways.
4.0,Not what I expected but still fit nicely
4.0,Very nice. Larger than it seems in photos.
4.0,"Feels thick and sturdy. Has a flattering fit. It fits over my butt nicely and doesn't expose too much of it and sort of smooths out my stomach a bit. And the lace is ver pretty! It survived the washing machine completely fine, but I don't put it in the dryer. I haven't had it very long, so I can't speak to the longevity of it. But so far so good!"
4.0,"Really like the goggles themselves, but wish they came with some sort of protective bag. The first ones arrived scratched since it comes in a thin plastic bag, but had better luck with the replacement with only a minor scratch. If you are not going to include a bag, at the very least provide some sort of protective film on the outside lens as well. If you are ordering these, do not order them with anything else in the shipment."
4.0,"It’s very comfortable, but at the end of a hot day, my toes smell, LOL.  I have to wipe down the part that touches my feet on hot days."
4.0,"I usually would buy a large, bought an XL just in case and it fits perfectly. Not too see-through but the material is light and airy so im buying a nude long camo to wear under. I'm 5'4&#34;, 158 lbs for reference."
4.0,I bought this and the long sleeved one that said badass since 1947 on it because we live in the Carolina's and can't tell the weather in the fall so he loved both shirts. Fit perfect. Fun shirts.
4.0,"love the glasses, lost a stone already but oh well!"
4.0,"Bought a couple of these before Christmas for gifts and had a family member fall in love with them and wanted one for themselves. I ordered this one - paid more than twice what I paid for the ones I bought at my local Sam's Club, but the local store doesn't keep them stocked - they just had them for the pre-season Christmas sales. I would order another f or a grandson who now wants one, but I'm not willing to keep paying more than twice what they sold for at the local store. Because of the Price-Gouger rate I had to deduct a star - the other four are for the product itself. (I have read in some other reviews that this does not wash-up well, if ours do not launder well I will come back and adjust my rating)."
4.0,"The bag is great! Sturdy and very nice colour...however, it is a little big for my liking....but that's a personal opinion and mistake"
4.0,"For an extra large, it is snug in the chest area"
4.0,"The buttons are loose and rattle around a bit, which is kind of weird, and it came wit an odd smell, but it isn't super strong and it faded. I got a couple of sizes up so it would be oversized and so I could wear it over sweatshirts, and it its just how I wanted it to, so I'm very happy."
4.0,I love the design but the closures on both are a little wonky.  Will keep still!
4.0,I was pleased when this shirt arrived as the color and feel was exactly what I expected. I wound up being disappointed when I tried it on as the large size fit more like a medium. If you do order this shirt definitely size up!!
4.0,"I like themthey look nice  they are light weight,  comfortable,  I shared them with friends and family."
4.0,Pros:<br />-love the slight ruffle on the sleeves/bottom of the jacket<br />-good color<br />-slightly stretchy material<br /><br />Cons:<br />Runs small and short
4.0,I loveee these rain bootsss!!!! Bright colors and super cute dinosaurs. I thought that size 5 was 14 cms around..based on the measurementsthe site said... but they are (12 cms)  🙄.... overall I loved them but wished they could be a lil bit bigger. Durability?? Don't know yet.... will keep updating
4.0,Somewhat tight fit
4.0,This band was bigger than others of the same size.
4.0,Very durable material and really like the clasp at the end and how there is a buckle towards the end of the lanyard.
4.0,This is a great mask. My 6 year old wears it to school. He has grown some and the strap around the back is tight so he just wears it around his ears. It comes with a few fliters to change and its easy to change them out.
4.0,Little bit large even for my size 9 feet!  But they are very soft and comfortable.
4.0,Cute little red dress. I'm size 11 got a med fits good.
4.0,"This dress fits me Perfect!<br />I just don’t understand the tie on the one shoulder, but that’s what makes it different."
4.0,I don't wear much jewelry and I didn't mind having this on all day. Makes having a hair tie on your wrist a lot more presentable.
4.0,This was a gift for my mother in law on Mother's Day. She loved them!
4.0,"Beautiful design and feel, wish it were a little larger for Excercise"
4.0,"The swim suit is so beautiful and cute, its actually of a good and better material than i thought. Its a material that stretches thereby making it for comfortable for babies. It comes with a swimming cap which fit my daughter perfectly well, maybe not for too long but am okay with it for now.<br />The suit is well sewn. Honestly, it’s much higher quality than I expected it to be. I love the design, and do not care much for the cut at the back.<br />I did not notice however that it is “bedazzled” on the front. That does not really bother me but it will be nice to be sure of what you are buying before ordering for it.<br />I’m still excited about summer because now my little girl is ready to take her first swim lesson.<br />I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest opinion in the form of a review and that is exactly what I have provided. My thoughts, opinions, and experiences are mine alone and my opinion has not been influenced by outside sources. If you find this review helpful, please let others know by clicking &#34;yes&#34;."
4.0,"Thin but effective.  They are fraying, but for the price it’s not a big surprise."
4.0,This woven cotton skirt is cool and it has pockets.  It wrinkles a lot after washing (I don't own an iron).  I would buy another if Amazon still offered them.
4.0,"I really liked the colors, material weight and feel, and style, however I ended up returning.  I am 5'3&#34;, 145 lbs and ordered both med and large to see which fit best. Both fit fine but hugged the 15 extra pounds I have around my middle.  Beautiful dresses, just not flattering for my build."
4.0,Good belt. But it had a scratch/mark on it - towards the tip.
4.0,The color is great but the stone has come loose after a month of semi use.
4.0,Works as advertised.  I feel a little embarrassed that I did not know about this sooner.  These are very functional to keep shirt tight and looking great.  I thank my friend for letting me know about these.
4.0,"My daughter loved it. she had a little of a hard time getting them broken into to, but all in all it was super cute"
4.0,It is very soft and warm. Inis a nice shade of baby blue. The fit is a little smaller than I expected for a 2XL. Overall a very nice product.
4.0,Have to wear invisible bra!
4.0,"These shirts are very cozy, come in nice colors, made of nice quality materials and seem well made. I haven't washed them yet so don't know how they'll hold up over time, but they appear to be well made. I also like that the lining is white so it goes with the outside colors, and that they are longer (hitting mid to low hip). However, the sizing is definitely unusual for US clients.  It is important to consult the chart and then order one size up. Curiously, though the larger the sizes, the longer it gets as well. Normally, I wear a size 6 but the medium was too snug. The extra large fit with enough room to layer underneath but came to mid thigh. The large would be the best fit but will be a bit long which Is fine for an over shirt."
4.0,Good quality watch but it's too big for my wrist 🙁
4.0,Loved this dress bought it for a friend and it fit perfectly for the event she went to.
4.0,"This suit actually fit! The material is pretty scratchy and uncomfortable and one of the straps needed mending, but it looks great and for the price and an online order, I am pretty impressed with the fit and consider the quality acceptable for the price."
4.0,I like this pentagram! Its amazing and its durable and looks excellent. My only thing is i wish it had a chain instead of a rope... Oh well. This is a cool pentagram!
4.0,"What type of clasp and color/metal does this have?  You do not show the clasp via picture.<br />It's very pretty.<br />Thanks,<br /><br />Nancy M"
4.0,"It is a pretty band and definitely more comfortable than the original band that came with my Garmin Vivoctive, but the clasp feels cheap. I'm not counting on it lasting for super long, but maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. It fit just fine and was easy enough to adjust to the size of my wrist."
4.0,"Bought these for my sister for her birthday! Love that this came with 3 pieces of jewelry for the price. She says the snitch necklace is her favorite. My favorite is the time turner. Was also very impressed with the quality, she wears everyday and chains are still holding strong. Sometimes I purchase discounted items for review but I did purchase this item at full price and an very satisfied with my purchase."
4.0,Nice material but again the sizing chart is wrong I order a size up from my size and it was still to small
4.0,It was as expected. I read other reviews and already knew it was printed on the back so just wore it backwards because i only needed it for Halloween.
4.0,Quality material and made well.
4.0,"good quality comfortable leggings, however not as tight as i wouldve liked, kinda could feel them coming down a little when i run"
4.0,Nice material and fits great. But really disappoint as the product came with a hole.
4.0,the case is slick but i like the picture so i guess i'll use it
4.0,"I love the style and overall build of the frames. They are very well constructed, the only criticism I would mention is the frame should of had a spring hinge instead of a fixed one. Overall great glasses for the price"
4.0,pants are a bit short in length
4.0,Not as polarized as i thought they would be. but still very nice
4.0,This is very pretty i wasn't expecting it to be this cute. The problem i see is the chain kinks up a lot. I bought this as a present and I think she will have a hard time with it.
4.0,Fit well everywhere except in the chest.
4.0,"Legs are too short for my average length baby, they kept riding up. The hat part does not stay on, slides off very easily due to the material. Material thinner than expected."
4.0,"This is really cute. I like it a lot. The chain is a little thin, but no so thin that it will break after one wear. The medallion is small about the size of a dime, but that is perfect for my daughter. It is absolutely adorable and my daughter loves it. I love it too. I may get myself one too. Very much worth the buy."
4.0,"very good quality, but, I think the size smaller then others, I usually wear size 8, so, I bought 8-10, it was still too small for me."
4.0,This is a fun mask and would be great for a costume. It is not really covid or germ protection. It is very very thin.
4.0,"Bought for a costume for my 10 yo daughter's play, good value (3 pieces).  A bit of a challenge to put on a d zip, but definitely cute and a good value"
4.0,"When looking at the sizing guide, don't go by their advice to go a size up if in doubt.  In my experience, I got the xxxl for my boyfriend to wear since he has around a 38&#34; waist and that was as large as they went.  I was afraid that it would be way too small after the seller's advice to go up a size, but in fact I probably should have gone at least one and for the best fit actually two sizes smaller to the xl.  The material itself is nice and thin compared to a lot of the thermo shaping belts that I have found, and I do believe that being that few inches smaller it would have fit him perfectly and been quite comfortable to wear under his work shirts.  He did keep the belt on for a few hours just to see how the material worked, and it definitely trapped the heat and made him sweat, so I can see how it would work very well if it had been the right size.  I am going to sew it to adjust versus going through the hassle of returning for a different size, and I think it will work perfectly for him in the end.  I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review, and I think that once resized, it will be the perfect slimming belt.  It appears that it will work well to induce sweating, while thin enough to be comfortable and unnoticeable under clothing."
4.0,"I normally wear a large in all workout pants, and do have many pairs of 90 Degree capris as well.  The waist band on these pants, although very comfortable, seems to be a bit looser than others.  The rest of the legging however fit as expected.  The fabric is super soft, and the pants can double as a casual legging or workout pant.  Love them."
4.0,"I love the pattern of this shirt.  Both the cut and design are extremely cute and offer a bit of fun to a shirt that is more than appropriate for work.<br /><br />The fabric is thick (no see-through here), a decent texture, and did not shrink in a normal wash and dry cycle.  I also noticed no fraying.  It's long sleeve, which is great with the colder weather coming on, but still light enough to wear during the summer in an air-conditioned office.<br /><br />My only issue would be on the sizing.  To me, this fit more like an extra large than a large.  It came down further than expected and was a bit wide in the middle.  Not terrible, but also not as flattering as it could have been.  I normally wear a medium to large depending on brand, and this is one of those cases where a medium might have been a better fit.<br /><br />Cute shirt, just be aware it runs a bit large.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2019"
4.0,These earrings are really cute. Unfortunately they're just a bit too big and cover up my second earring  hole. They're also not comfortable to sleep in due to the size.
4.0,"These are really great earrings, especially for the price. The ribbed design is a perfect complement to jewelry with rope, ridge, or shell accents, such as many Southwestern jewelry pieces. I deducted a star only because the post-and-clutch setup is very tight and tough to work with; one of the posts broke right off in the clutch when I tried to put on these earrings for only the second time. However, I like these hoops so much that I came back to buy a replacement pair and write this review. Overall, I recommend these for great everyday wear and for simple, inexpensive coordination with Carolyn Pollack jewelry.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have found that if I don't use the backs that come with the hoops, they are much easier to put on and wear; instead, I just use the silicone backs from another pair of earrings. I still really like these hoops and wear them often."
4.0,"I love this purse but it was kinda stinky... my hubby said it smelled like leather maybe it's my super strong pregnancy nose but I smelled fish not leather... I've had it about a week now and even with dryer sheets, perfume, and lots of airing out I can still smell it"
4.0,"I like this shirt. I'm 5'6&#34;, 200 pounds. I ordered a 3xl after reading reviews. I normally wear a 1x or 2x. It is made of great stretchy comfy material. I definitely wish it was longer. This is my only complaint."
4.0,"Nice earrings.  They look good, but are a little smaller than I expected.  I like them though, and am giving them to my God daughters."
4.0,The legs are too short for my taste. Otherwise excellent boxers
4.0,"Nice and Soft but a little big for newborns. they kept coming out the first month, and my baby was over 7lbs.  On the 2nd month they finally stayed in but baby was 11lbs already."
4.0,Size ran a bit large but still acceptable.  Wish it had a back zipper pocket.  Runners appreciate this to prevent items from falling out of the pockets during a workout.
4.0,Very pretty and very feminine.
4.0,The Color is way off and is not Royal Blue. Otherwise it's nice & fits good.
4.0,"I like it very much, it's vaporous, then it's perfect for my country that is tropical"
4.0,"Great for my little girl's birthday party. Had to glue a couple pieces a little bit but for price & shipping time, better than at party city's that I compared it to."
4.0,Great for the money. Only small problem is that they are a little tight around my upper arm. I do have 18&#34; arms however.
4.0,"I'm keeping this bag; however, I am disappointed.  First the good comments:  The color is great - just like the picture a rich saddle tan.  The bag seems to be made very well. This bag did NOT smell.  Now the disappointing things:  I measured a file folder before ordering and decided that it should fit in the open sides - it does not!  The 2 zipper pockets are ok; but, those two sleeves at too short for even my poor little old flip phone!  The center section is like throwing your stuff in a dark hole.  The fix:  I had an old purse organizer in cream that I put in the center section.  It worked great - I can now see what is in there and it is nice and neat.  Still cannot fit a file folder in there correctly which was my main purpose for buying this type bag; but, it will work standing on end - guess that will have to do!"
4.0,"These earrings are solid and well made with an approximate length of 2.5"". They have a substantial weight which might make my ears sore if I wear them for a whole day. The hooks are sturdy and they come with little rubber push backs for added security. The front has a sort of bushed/etched look to them but still catch the light and shine. The back has a hammered worn/weathered texture but still quite smooth and hallmarked PZ Israel 925. I purchased them on sale for about $20 with free Prime shipping which was a great price for the quality."
4.0,Have been using it for a few month. Works as intended. Just be careful of the zipper getting caught in the material when you are zipping it up.
4.0,"It's a bit clunky, but alright"
4.0,I like this cap and it appears to be good quality. Unfortunately the elastic inside is a little to tight for me and I cover my hair at work with a scarf or a hat. As soon as I put it on I started to get a headache and I can’t run the risk of getting headaches at work. I am very sensitive even Bobby pins gives me headaches. I need something a little bit more loser. In the meantime I’m going to try and stretch the cap out a bit.
4.0,Love it.  Fits perfectly with my watch and looks good too.  I am not giving it a 5 star yet.  I need to wear it a while to see if it tarnishes or if the locks loosens.
4.0,Good sized as requested.
4.0,Loved the dress. Only complaint is that it was pretty short.
4.0,Very nice earrings and packaged very nice but sad to say the rhinestones are no where near the color black more like a smokey gray
4.0,"Very comfortable, great stretch."
4.0,Fiesta de vaqueros
4.0,I like the watch but the instructions weren’t very clear and it was a bit of a pain to set up. Had it come with a little better instructions I would’ve probably given another store. It’s an inexpensive watch so you get what you pay for but it looks nice and will serve me well for the next year I’m sure.
4.0,"I'm a big guy, 6'2"" and  hovering between 2X and 3X. I'm always wondering which size to get.  With these I tried the 3X. Definitely wrong, and seriously - I could pull them up to my sternum. I swear they would have fit Shaq or even Andre the Giant quite comfortably.  With all this said, they are soft, stretchy and otherwise very comfortable. Just beware - these run very, Very, VERY large."
4.0,"The are as advertised, they work great"
4.0,Scored this dress for $5.  The dress is pretty plain and simple.  I think I'll be using it for more of a bathing suit cover up as it's a bit see through.  I normally wear a size 12 and got the large - it fits perfectly.
4.0,"Nice top. I got the Red and it's just like pictured. It feels high quality like it will last for a long time. It does zip up the back, so be aware you need help to wear it!"
4.0,"This shirt is cute and versatile. The lace is a bit stiff/rough at 1st but softens with washing. The lacey portion also, is bigger then the sleeve cuff making it a little bit &#34;poofy&#34; vs. In the picture where it looks smooth. My arms are a little bigger so this may be the reason. It may lay flatter on thinner arms. Hope this helps."
4.0,This is a really pretty sweater but I had to do some mending prior to wearing it but liked it too much to return it.  The colors are true to the photos.  I got the gray.  Have not yet laundered it yet so will come back with an update.
4.0,"I bought this ruff ( it is not a ""collar""!)  to put on either a jester character or, if it wasn't good enough, on another character in an opera set in 1580.  For $23 what did I have to lose?:)  Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it actually is.  Very soft & flexible for a singer.  For buyers who, like me, were frustrated at not knowing the finished length in advance - here is some size info:  15 inches long with two 10"" ribbon ties attached.  The springy, white polyester ribbon is 2 1/2"" wide.  For a sewer, it would be pretty easy to buy more ribbon and copy the folds to extend the neck size.  Much quicker than starting from scratch!  Hint: I store ruffs in round cookie (biscuit ) tins.  Keeps 'em from getting squashed.<br />Hope this helps!"
4.0,"It’s not bad! Definitely too much money for what it is, buttttt it’s not poorly made. The fabric is somewhat of a sports shorts material and so is the shirt. This can be a pro or a con considering it’s very thin and doesn’t keep warm. It also was a little small but I think it’s best that way because if you go a size larger it’s too big.<br /><br />To sum it up, it’s probably best just to DIY it, but if you don’t got time and have some extra money it’s worth it"
4.0,Nice. Low dome. No broken or cracked tiles.
4.0,"Was unsure about the top when I first pulled it out of the package. But once I tried it on, it felt very comfortable, the collar lays nicely, the shape is flattering, and it keeps it shape. Length is just right for pairing with leggings or jeans."
4.0,"These were used for party favors. Kids loved having their own hat in our fire truck-themed party. They are not thick plastic, but I didn't expect them to be for this price. These won't last years, but they served their purpose for me."
4.0,"Just took a simple cut , and the belt fit right. Keeps my pants on a lot better than a normal belt would."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:b8b74906e18844c66a2a4ce897d42803]] And I buy another one for the other ear 👂 so nice wish the sell both side da
4.0,In person the dress is so cute. It is a wrap dress. I should have ordered a size larger so it could wrap a little more. But I gave it to my daughter and she looked so good in it. Good materials really dressy for a party or wedding.
4.0,The sleeves are a little to long.
4.0,I’m very tall so. It was a little short
4.0,Fit well just no padding
4.0,I noticed the fabric has started to develop what I call pills
4.0,"It’s bigger than expected, but still great with a topper! I’m 5’9” with a distinct hourglass shape. I ordered an XL because you never know how this style will fit the hips! :) I could have definitely sized down, and the length is perfection!<br />I will be pairing it with a button down, kimono, or a jean jacket so I’m not really worried about it being loose fitting. Very comfortable!"
4.0,"Very cool graphics. The beanie seems a bit small, but it is well-made, and I can't say anything negative about the fingerless gloves.  Good buy."
4.0,A bit to full.
4.0,"It is a good well made rain suit but you may want to order a larger size. I wear an XL and that is what I ordered. The jacket fits over a t-shirt but is snug. The pants will not go over another pair of pants. The jacket would be too tight if it was cooler and you had a jacket on already.<br />It is a good weight material, well constructed, and it did not have that strong smell that most vinyl products have. I recommend it just make sure you order a larger size."
4.0,"90 degree in th is polyester (90%) mix is the best.  Lightweight, comfortable, great fit."
4.0,These compression tights were comfortable except they were tight at the waist. They did stretch minimally which is how compression works. They are thick and you cannot see through them.
4.0,like it but it was a little bigger than I thought
4.0,"The dress is beautiful.  There are 2 issues I have. I was sent the wrong  dress,  I ordered yellow as shown, but received yellow A. It is actually a soft peach tye-dyed, and I love it and will keep it! The other issue are the arm pits, not sure why manufacturers think XL needs Huge pits! So I ordered a tube style strapless bra and hope that will ""cover"" it. Great dress for the price! It will be my wedding dress for our backyard wedding!"
4.0,Good studs but don’t expect to get all the colors pictured. Mine came with a few duplicates of the same color. Kinda disappointed.
4.0,"Very cute, just a bit small."
4.0,It wasn’t long enough for my checkbook but overall it looked good
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Very cute. Seems to be good quality so far
4.0,its seem somewhat cheap but it is ok for its incredibly low price.thank you.<br />excellent delivery. a little smaller than I expected but it was my fault
4.0,I love the color selection on this sellers page for the covers. Also the Price is great for the product.
4.0,I bought this to go over my swimsuits. The quality could be better but overall it’s a nice dress.
4.0,very cool invention.  I am having an outdoor wedding on the grass and these will help me from not sinking in the grass.
4.0,"Have been looking for a while now to find good quality belts that won't crack or peel and it seems I've found as close to perfect as you can find today. I purchased two of these belts, a black and a mahogany and I'm quite pleased with what I've seen so far, I've worn each just twice and so far I'm very satisfied with the fit, comfort and support i got. The workmanship and finish is of fine quality. I must add though that I purchased two sizes bigger than my 34&#34; waist denims and I was still able to find a hole that fits just right. From all indications these belts will last a few years, very good product at a great price."
4.0,Bracelet was of great quality and thick braided leather
4.0,Cute but the back pin is already unstable. I am sure I will have to reinforce it with glue or something. Not worth more than $10.00.
4.0,"I wore this to a party and got many compliments.  The only detraction is that it does not have a belt, which I do think it needs.  I bought a belt and it looked great!"
4.0,No what I expected.  Returned.
4.0,Really liked shirt but ordered the XL and this definitely fits as a large.
4.0,Really was happy
4.0,"I like it, and used it. I didn't realize it was so big when i got it, it definitely was a huge board for no real reason, the players or teams weren't really any bigger just a lot of white space."
4.0,"I was so disappointed when this came in because it was just beautiful, so soft, true black, but would not fit my shoulder area! I am only 5'4 and I'm not broad of shoulder so I was very disappointed that it didn't fit because I so very much wanted it to! Otherwise though I recommend it any day of the week and twice on Sundays!"
4.0,Would have preferred a specific (Medium) size as opposed to a one-size-fits-all.
4.0,"Comfortable fabric, decent quality, but not as comfortable as anticipated. Majority of my complaint is just that I was expecting a bit more length out of the legs, as well my balls feeling a little more comfortable in the pouch. For designing something in attempt to fit nearly everyone, it's great. I'm happy with the product, but not planning on purchasing this exact pair again. Possibly another pair with probably 6 inches on the legs. In terms of my 28 in. Waist, it fits surprisingly well."
4.0,"I purchased these socks to wear with hiking boots. They are well made. They stay up and do not roll down or scrunch down under my feet. I took off one star because I was hoping for better cushioning under my heel. If you’re looking for a heavier cushion, these are not the socks for you. But if you are looking for some nicely made socks in some pretty colors, I definitely recommend these."
4.0,"I wish it was adjustable or a little smaller but it is soft, comfy, and adorable."
4.0,"I really enjoy this dress. Very comfortable, not see through, fit as expected. The only thing I don’t really like about it is how heavy it feels."
4.0,"The only complaint I have, is that I wish it zipped up. I sometimes worry that my cards might fall out, or that my phone will slip out, if it's not in the little inside pocket. Other than that, I LOVE THIS WALLET! It's soft, holds loads of things, and is small enough to carry with, or without a larger purse. Definitely a great purchase and great quality for the price."
4.0,"Great sweatshirt , only thing is material is a little thinner than I had hoped for with all the cold weather in New England. Great for Spring or fall or buy a size larger to wear over another sweatshirt."
4.0,"To be fair, I have broad shoulder. This shirt kind of keeps climbing up, but it was good for my engagment photos."
4.0,Quick shipment but the shirt wasn't as nice as what the picture looked like.
4.0,"Good water shoe, kid loves them."
4.0,Too short I’m 5’5 140 I got an xlrg .. but it’s very pretty
4.0,"My daughter loved this for dance. It has a great shoe section. She has size 11 womens shoes and she manages to get a ton of her shoes in. One zipper stopped working, and they DO need to be handled gently, but she may have pushed it. A more expensive bag may have a tougher zipper."
4.0,"Absolutely loving this bra. I went a size up like most. It fits well and does amazing things for cleavage 😍 seems well made, if it holds up I’ll definitely be buying more."
4.0,"A little hard or impossible to get them onn sunglasses with fatter arms, but that also helps make them not slip off"
4.0,liked the item and it was purchased for cooler weather
4.0,Of course it wasn't plus size. Couldn't contain me. I did wear it as a cover up over a camo when I went shopping though.
4.0,"I love the bright pink color! The pockets do detract from the way the dress hangs, they should be  attached somehow so they don't bunch on the sides. Other than that I really like the way the dress fits."
4.0,"I just repierced my nose and I used this as my initial jewelry, and I love them, they are small, and cuute. The shipping was very fast I received them way sooner than expected"
4.0,Very nice looking headbands<br />I'll say for Med./Small heads<br />4 star only because 1 or 2 very wrinkled<br />otherwise you'll love them
4.0,"I'm a jean's type of guy. So, when I had the opportunity to try the Denim Garage Classics Men's Relaxed Straight Leg Stretch Jean Dark Blue I had to give it a try. First thing I noticed, the faded part on the legs are too much for my taste. The contrast between very deep blue to very, very light blue (almost white) is just  too blatant, too much of a difference. Maybe their other, more faded jean colors it's not as bad, but here....ugh.<br /><br />Having said that, the jeans are comfortable and the sizing very good. I wear between a 38 to 38 waste, depending on the manufacturer. These were 34 and were only very slightly loose. The denim is rather soft and again, comfortable. Depending on what other color options Denim Garage has, I would not have any hesitancy in purchasing these. Pricing is currently a bit high, but not astronomical."
4.0,"For an old duffer in Sport Coat, these have been better than neckties to hide ugly neck wrinkles. Stores in USA do not carry these items. As such, I could order this set, sitting at home. It looksdecent and is easy to wrap around the neck, the small kerchief slips into the Blazer breast pocket, moustache wax on gray hair and one is ready to grab the shooting stick."
4.0,"I would size up on this dress. I ware a large/xl in shirts, I ordered an xl and the arms fit impossibly tight. I had to cut the sleeves. The material is great breathable and comfy and fits very well after taking off the sleeves."
4.0,Better than other gloves I have tried but tips of fingers still got cold after about 30 minutes.
4.0,Cute dress the material is sort of thin but not ridiculously thin. choose your undergarments wisely
4.0,"Super comfy and cute. If you happen to be a short gal, or say under 5'9&#34; This might be too long for you without alterations. With (say 2.5-3&#34; ish) heels 5'7&#34; ish gals could work it with out stumbling on material. You really do need to be a tall one to wear this.  And if you need bust coverage/minimal support...at best a strapless bra with this one. (Hopefully a strapless with a thinner, cute back piece as it WILL show.) Recommended underwear: a low rise thong. The hip area is roomier than you might think. Go with your gut feeling and experience with your body type to determine your needed size. This is a super comfortable lounge on the deck/beach dress. I love it! It is super comfortable and has such a stylish back. It will not, however, be for everyone or every body type."
4.0,"Nice look, sturdy."
4.0,"Has become my everyday band now.  I originally wanted it for only activities ie. gym, basketball, but i find myself using it more than my actual wedding band."
4.0,"Quality is better than expected. Very opaque stockings. 100 denier, very thick like tights. Hold up very well. Only problem is they're a little large. I'm on the cusp between M and L, should have got the M. Will get M next time. Made in Italy. Definitely recommend. Husband will love them."
4.0,Nice material super stretching
4.0,The shirt is cute and the material is decent it just doesn’t stretch. I ordered a L and it fit but it’s too snug for me. Returning for an XL.
4.0,Transferring watch bands was easy after I figured out how to use the devise
4.0,"The color of the material was not what it said it was , it look wash out and old ."
4.0,Super cute and fashionable. Loose fit
4.0,I absolutely love them! they take a little getting used to (I'm always in flat shoes) but they are great quality and definitely a bargain for the price
4.0,"Very small, and I bought a size bigger than normal. They seemed to be made of good quality material, and probably very comfortable if they would’ve fit. I had to return them."
4.0,The watch is simple and pretty! Big fan of rose gold detail. Felt like when I received it in the mail everything was in order and neat. Nothing broken or scratched. Enjoying my purchase.
4.0,Lens a little to dark for my liking but they are very nice glasses for the price.
4.0,Had this about 5 months wearing it everyday. Color is starting to wear some as I would expect. The edges seem to be getting rough as they snag some of my shirts & my seatbelt in the car??
4.0,The top was a little to big
4.0,Good material and comfortable<br />Wash on cold and dry on low heat.
4.0,looks great. chain it to short to display on rearview mirror
4.0,"This was a present, it was recieved with much pleasure."
4.0,Got it for my bf for his bday and he loves it!!
4.0,Our family enjoys using these to keep our glasses straight. The suctions work ok but often have to be re-stuck on a few times through the night.
4.0,I like that it is reversible.  Quality is what I expected.
4.0,"these are replacement, so they are small, but this up-size fits."
4.0,Exactly what I expected it to be and I love it
4.0,Just want I was hoping for
4.0,Super cute just a lot smaller than I thought !! Next time I will read the dimensions!! My daughter loved them !!
4.0,"So I bought these pants as a pretty bold experiment. Could people of my size look good in this type of pant.<br /><br />My answer was no. No plus size people like me don't look good. Hey, maybe if it was a little bigger it might have worked but I didn't feel glamours but was worried about looking a little like I had a desert animal's digit."
4.0,Good construction ran small and my head is small 19 inches in circumference  thought it would fit better
4.0,It's a super cute aged rope. I wish it had been a little longer. It it works well for the purpose I purchased it for
4.0,The color just didn’t look good with my skin tone.
4.0,"Really loved this, but again way too big and the stretchy string seems to be too stretchy. Hated too, but had to return. Again, it would be great if you could make the jewelry by individual wrist size. Thanks for your letter."
4.0,"These are comfortable, high quality briefs.<br /><br />They wash up well and come out of the dryer pretty much as they went in (don't over dry and don't dry on too high heat when products contain spandex).<br /><br />My husband finds them a little roomy in the crotch."
4.0,"Comfy, great for running around in workout clothes"
4.0,It is good but one of the rings were rusty and loosing colour
4.0,"Pero debo tener cuidado al lavarlo, pues el dibujo parece caerse con facilidad"
4.0,"The buckle is made very well. The belt also seems to be of high quality. Cutting belt to size was very easy.  I did have a little problem getting the belt<br />unbuckled. I am fairly old at 78, so perhaps the issue was being a senior. The more I used it, the easier it got. I believe the instructions could have<br />been more clearer on how to get it unfastened. I would have given it 5 starts, with the exception of hard to unbuckle."
4.0,"It blocks the sun very well. It held up in moderate wind. It is not nearly as small, folded,  as the photo shows, and is heaver than I expected ( but I have not weighed it or checked again to see if it was proposed to be a lighter weight).<br />It is really cute!!"
4.0,"I bought them for myself and the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they are a little too big for my head. I still wear them though and they do float, which was the main reason I bought them."
4.0,The booties are great! The fit was good for my small foot with a high arch and instep.
4.0,I read the reviews. I'm usually an L and ordered XL and it fits perfectly. I love the zipper and the thumb holes. Very comfortable<br />I also like that it's not super short.
4.0,"Received today, looks great but it’s very thin."
4.0,"Love most of this shirt, however there is a seam down the front I didn't expect that makes it sit a bit funny."
4.0,"Wife is a Phlebotomist, and loves this little gift.  Has received compliments from co-workers.<br />Fast Shipping, Great Experience with sale all the way around."
4.0,Very confortable. I am currently pregnant and was a cute top even with a belly
4.0,"I chose this particular brand/style because I wanted a pair of good quality, polarized sunglasses that wouldn't overwhelm my face, and other reviewers had said they were ideal for a smaller face (they were right). These glasses are straightforward and look exactly like the photo--they are sports-type glasses without bling or fancy accents. Lens shape is aesthetically pleasing and the frame is very comfortable. I especially like these glasses for driving; the polarization is great for navigating the low position of the sun this time of year."
4.0,"The outlayer (shorts) fit great. The inner layer (briefs) were a bit too loose. Overall fit was good, not great. I'm 5 foot 6, 170lbs and got the medium size. I do think I chose the right size."
4.0,It's not too shabby.
4.0,These are so cute! I love them! They did take a little bit to break him and hurt for the first few wears but totally worth it because they are so cute. I have really big feet (11) and these for just fine.
4.0,My little girl liked it a lot!
4.0,Cute and I can use for everyday.
4.0,I like this jacket except for the inside lining. It makes the jacket look cheap
4.0,"These tie clips look very nice and sleek. I like how they are simple and classic, but have that modern touch with the stainless steel look. I do wish they were a little shorter in length because my boyfriend likes to wear skinny ties and unfortunately it's just about the same width as some of his ties. Other than that, they are pretty easy to slip on without fear of damaging your clothes. Good pieces to boost your tie game!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion."
4.0,This fits everywhere but the chest - I couldn’t zip it over my chest and will be returning. Wish it was made to accommodate a fuller chest.
4.0,Nice shirt I would order more but you don’t have my size. 3X fat boy size!
4.0,"Fits good, light, and comfortable"
4.0,"Good fabric, light to wear and easy to adjust to fit your hair.Good product."
4.0,"This bracelet is very pretty, especially for the price, but a little darker blue than I would have liked.  I was planning to wear it with a sapphire blue necklace and ring.  It almost looks black."
4.0,I like them for around the house. They run big.
4.0,"I have EDS and my doctor suggested these to me to help with my knee instability while trying to remain somewhat active. They are generally really comfortable, the pressure around my pelvis, hips and knees definitely helped manage some of my pain while walking. They will be incredibly snug when you first put them on but they will relax a little and gradually get more comfortable and easy to put on or take off with time while still maintaining a good amount of pressure where it’s needed.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the elastic around the waist digs into my belly too much especially when I sit down. With that said, I do want to note, for reference of anyone debating getting these, while I am pretty thin (only 104 lbs) I also have a belly that is unusually sensitive to pressure, so it is a little hard for me to definitely say if the waist elastic is actually putting more pressure than the rest or if it’s just because that area is hypersensitive for me."
4.0,"Cheap, cute sunglasses. Not great polarization like my $50 sunglasses, I have the feeling maybe they are just tinted a bit, but they look good, easy to look fashionable for a great price."
4.0,"This key chain is soft enough to not damage or scratch your motorcycle. My only issue is that the visor popped off and is gone. Now he has an open faced helmet. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning. For $10 though, you can’t ask for much more!"
4.0,"This pant is well made, good quality fabric, not too stretchy, not transparent.size runs a bit larger . I love the pockets."
4.0,"great product,took awhile to get,but finally arrived."
4.0,"Loved the top, but the bottoms are huge. I'm 5'1, 110lb, B cup and ordered a size small."
4.0,I bought these shortly after the ring that matched. I love this color!
4.0,super cute shirt. fun and great for the enthusiast. Thought it ran a little small but XXXL not available.
4.0,It is a  large dangle charm. I am not a huge fan of the extremely white silver than ninaqueen uses. I wish it matched better with pandora's oxydized silver.... otherwise it is a nice charm.
4.0,"Very cute and exactly what I was looking for! But be aware that it is not a &#34;dusty rose&#34; pink, but rather more of a pink-orange coral color. It has no insultaion so don't expect it to be warm, it's basically a cute rain poncho."
4.0,"First of all, this is a genuine review.  I saw one review which said all of these reviews are fake.  I'm rough on my sunglasses, so I usually don't spend more than $15-20 for a pair, knowing that often my glasses won't survive the summer.  For $15, these are definitely worth it.  I haven't had them long, but so far so good.  I'll update the review if they break easily. They come in a black box which is kind of cool itself, but also have a little cloth sack, a cleaning rag, and a regular glasses case.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I like contoured sunglasses that wrap around my face a little more, but these are a little flatter.  As always when buying items like this online, buyer beware.  Sunglasses are a product that you may want to see and try on before you buy."
4.0,Me and my girlfriend love these! The metal part could be a little smaller though.. otherwise a great buy!
4.0,Love this band. Works great with my Samsung Gear. Very durable. I work and handle tire off and on all night long. Haven't had any problems with it holding up.
4.0,"Great value, better than  expevted"
4.0,Really good value for money. Not the sturdiest but hey... it was a good deal.
4.0,"I liked it, but I wish it had a smaller wrist band to better fit my 5 and 8 years old kids"
4.0,I was really excited for this costume as it came with the tights and everything where as other costumes came with a lot less. Overall fit is as expected I got a size medium. Super comfy and light weight which will be easy to wear! Really happy with this purchase!
4.0,I usually wear a medium top but decided to size up. So glad I did! Fits well. Hits right at the knee. Not low cut at all. Very comfortable! I would recommend sizing up.
4.0,This dress is beautiful. It definitely runs small though. I usually wear a U.S. Size 6 and I ordered a 10. It fit perfectly.
4.0,"thin and comfortable. Only wore them a few times and no problems yet, but worried that as thin as they are they may not last too long."
4.0,Just what I wanted. On one side it was slightly off but I use the original screws and bracket and it did the trick. It looks awesome.
4.0,"Very pretty and functional. They are thicker than just lace, so expect a little weight to them. Durable and dainty"
4.0,It makes my hair feel great but it barely fits my shoulder length thin hair. Works for me but probably not many!
4.0,not the best quality but good for the price
4.0,The padding is not removable. Makes top stiff and stand away from skin.
4.0,Not a bad product and delivered on time but very pricy!
4.0,Super cute and can’t beat the price!
4.0,Serves the money.
4.0,Muy bonita pero si es talla S ordene una talla L por qué viene muy reducida
4.0,It's a 1zzz
4.0,These are my favorite socks. I purchased some 2 and 3 years ago and I recently had to retire them. I wear them all the time so I'm happy that they lasted this long.<br />The replacements are VERY comfortable but they are not as thick in the calf or the foot. My old ones wore out in the foot so I do not expect the new ones to last as long. The new ones are much more likely to roll down my legs.
4.0,Cute charms. Just wish they would have came with the connector piece.
4.0,"This tunic fits true to size and has a loose fit. It reaches the top of my bottom. I love the bronze color. The fabric is soft, and the tunic is well made and well stitched. 96% polyester, 4% spandex Cute top for any occasion"
4.0,"great quality, but fit small"
4.0,Well I purchased another pair last year and was very happy with the fit and durability first off. I decided to buy another and received them. Only issue is they sent me a obvious black pair but I ordered gray. I didn’t return them because I was also ordering a black pair as well. As far as fitmet they are pretty true to size. Very comfortable and do not fade. Like I said only issue I have is the wrong color was sent. Even checked the package and they are marked as grey but we’re in fact black.
4.0,The images are a bit hard to make out but the colors are very nice and the price is great. They will be great for casual wear.
4.0,I wear these every chance I get. They are comfortable enough for shopping or mowing the yard or just heading out for a day at the lake.  They've held up great the last 4 yrs.
4.0,Love the snug fit but if your top is bigger then your bottom there’s a slight problem haha .. gotta work on the butt ox 🤣 other then that I like it I own 2 of them different styles great for paddle boarding n Kayaking or even when the water is just a little chilly It  covers your back
4.0,Vibrant colors and can dressed up or down. Great buy!
4.0,"Disregard previous review, you guys came through. Out of all the items I got (around 50) only a few got mixed up and this was the only one that came (only a day) later than expected."
4.0,Love these earrings.  They are definitely big and I personally love big earings.  The gold is a little cheap looking but for the price and item I think that is ok.
4.0,I love this dress I had to go back and order another one and will most likely get one in every color!  It is super comfortable and I love the way it's just easy and cool on a hot day.
4.0,"I’m content with this set. It’s not see through and is very comfy. The only thing I wish was different is the top, it’s not as slouchy as the picture and the cut isn’t as deep. But still cute! Also the drawstring isn’t actually functional unfortunately, just decoration which is annoying. But I’m keeping the set and will maybe get another color. I got it in a Medium and fits great, would maybe even look good in a Large but then the shorts definitely wouldn’t fit."
4.0,Much nicer than imaged
4.0,Cute. Worked for what I needed. Looked at little faded and cheaper in person though.
4.0,"Very attractive, and reaches beyond my butt and crotch.  So it pairs well with leggings.<br /><br />I would suggest that a color coordinating bra be worn, due to the mesh areas"
4.0,"It's a beautiful shirt. It fits fairly snug for a 2XL but not too tight. I didn't get a chance to wear it in Vegas because it was way too hot for a long sleeve even at night, but I will wear it next week for a dinner date."
4.0,These masks are nice. My only issue is the ear pieces hurt my ears after a while. The masks are too big without them so I just wear them and hope for the best at the end of the day.
4.0,Fit ok. I fpund one i liked better
4.0,"Belt is distinctive and the leather is hefty, which should make it last.  It runs a little small so you might consider a size up.  Buckle is solid and looks classy.  Have only had the belt for a few weeks."
4.0,"Is it amazing?  No.  Does it work?  yes.  Basically, it's a thick piece of elastic with a clasp.  It does stretch a little after use, so you'll probably need to readjust every now and then.  I wish the buckle were a little more solid, although mine hasn't broken, at least not yet, and I wish it required a little less effort to readjust its size, but it works."
4.0,Good value and like that it covers the stomach.
4.0,"Very nice, basic wedge."
4.0,I don’t know that it really did anything amazing but the material is nice and feels good on. Smoothes you out a little but nothing crazy
4.0,I'm 160 lbs 5'7 I ordered a medium but should have ordered a small it's thick material soft feeling great buy just go a size down runs big
4.0,"It is just a tad long, but would rather have long than short. I just need to wear heels."
4.0,"It is a very nice simple mask, very nice soft material and the most important thing, is that it stays in place :) - would use with a mask under for better covid19 protection"
4.0,nice simply but cute!
4.0,really cute. bought them for my 10 year old. she loves them. not really made sturdy enough for every day use as she wanted them to be. but great for costume or special occasion.
4.0,"I loved these masks, I thought they were so cute and my son would be more comfortable for him to wear all day at school.. unfortunately he hates them cause he can’t keep it up on his face. Lol but I occasionally wear them as headbands, they’re comfy!"
4.0,The skirt is cute but totally see through. It's just made of tool and my daughter will have to wear a pair of shorts underneath it. But it is colorful though. I just thought it had its own lining underneath it. The company knew I wasn't necessarily satisfied with it and they absolutely wonderful to work with.
4.0,I love these pants  they seem to fit perfectly at first  they are so unique and so cute on you can wear them with boots easily I would always buy another pair however the pair that I bought after I wore them a couple times the waistband started slipping down and I keep having to pull them up some thinking I should've gotten a smaller size but they're a beautiful pant thank you so much
4.0,"If you are looking for waterproof gloves then I would not recommend these. If you are looking for a set of comfortable, lightweight and relatively warm in bad weather gloves then you should definitely give these a look."
4.0,Too big but I save it when she get bigger
4.0,These are great. The ankles are little loose but other than that they are perfect. I'm gonna buy more of them.
4.0,Luv it... I got the 2x and its a lil snug but I love it and I need more!!!
4.0,"Easy to walk around looking at things when shopping, so I do not constantly have to take the glasses in my bag"
4.0,I like this purse alot
4.0,Great looking shoe. Just wish I had gotten the right size. Really reading is fundamental lol
4.0,"This MarCielo women's fleece pajamas are too small for me, but I expected that since they're a size smaller than I wear now. Ordered smaller on purpose to motivate me to lose weight. Mine are red and black plaid fleece which is really soft but not a good quality fabric. They seem comfortable especially when you have the correct size. The top has buttons and the bottom has an elastic waist and pockets. Made of 100% polyester which may speak to the lesser quality. Needs to be a cotton and polyester blend for better comfort and breathability. Polyester makes me perspire where adding some cotton would help especially since everyone's temperatures go up while they're sleeping."
4.0,Absolutely adorable. But the baby size was smaller than expected. The adult size was perfect. I reached out to exchange for a larger baby size but I didn’t get a response.
4.0,It was kinda small.....but it's very sturdy!
4.0,"My Mom really liked these for her Mothers Day Present, they are very very small however so take caution as they could be lost easily."
4.0,"This sweater would be perfect if it were long-sleeved as shown in the photo. Instead, it has 3/4 sleeves (which the desc says, I think). If you have large arms or want to wear it over something with sleeves then you may need to go up one size. I normally wear a petite med or large. Even this petite large has no extra room, but it will work for me. It's a very nice weight for summer."
4.0,"I ordered these for my daughter, as she looks for the ""unusual"" in earrings.  They were quite different....however they were smaller than I thought (from the picture).  Would I order them again?  I don't know."
4.0,I love them! So pretty and so cute! However the yellow one came with a flower off and another flower barely hanging on.
4.0,"Fits great but magnetic catch does slip some.  I have to tighten up the band a couple times a day, not a big problem.  The metal cover over the magnet came unglued but super glue fixed that.  Happy with the look of the band, great improvement over the stock band."
4.0,"Great fit, good price."
4.0,"Just as pictured, very glittery and pretty. Nice knit band with sequins.  The fit is good, stays in place, and will work for cold days. I didn't find it loose fitting, as others stated. It was a nice, snug fit."
4.0,"The fit of the dress was fine, quality of the fabric was perfect. The only flaw was the length of the skirt part. Personally, it would’ve been preferred to have the skirt at the knee instead of above it."
4.0,I only gave it 4 stars because it came with a weird smell that I had a hard time getting off. But otherwise it was comfortable and a great compliment to my costume.
4.0,"I thought it was smaller then the normal size, since my face is small. thanks for fast shipping."
4.0,"My wife was really hoping these leggings would be a light pale pink as seen in the pictures, but the color is really more of a light dusty rose. They fit true to size for the most part (she ordered a small) although the waist band has one thin elastic at the very top that can be a bit tight. The one thing my wife really didn’t like is the fit due to the design and pocket placement. The pockets sit towards the front of the pants rather than the side, and they just like odd. She much prefers having the pocket on the side of her leggings, especially with how her cell phone fits in the front. The quality is decent and the fabric is stretchy enough, although they could be softer."
4.0,snug but good to beach around in
4.0,"This product was received well in advance and it good order.  Although the packaging was not so good, the content was in great condition.  Thanks"
4.0,Seemed to be enjoyed as a gift.
4.0,This was a gift and it was nice.
4.0,"I love it, good sterling silver but fits more like a choker on my adult neck. wish the chain was longer"
4.0,These are super useful in form factor. They can act as a water bottle holder or alternatively to stow gear. I personally use them to stash NP1 batteries for film production.<br /><br />Overall a great buy
4.0,"It was a gift, it was alright thinner then I expected"
4.0,"absolutely beautiful dress, the design is very pretty, my daughter wanted to be Princess Belle for her birthday I figured instead of buying a costume I rather get her a dress, she absolutely love it and the price was good too, definitely buying her more in other colors, only downfall is that it is a bit big but she’ll grow into it"
4.0,Like shirt. Was told it was going to arrive on Friday by 10 but came Monday
4.0,Love it! The wife wears it around the house mostly and it keeps her warm.
4.0,Fits great out of the box. Almost no break in period. The lacing system is a little difficult to tightened and loosen. But the out of the box fit the most impressive. I would give it 5 stars but I will have to used it a little longer to judge its perfomance.
4.0,Comfortable and nice fitting
4.0,The band the watch came with was difficult to use. This is simple and attractive. My wrist is very small and it still makes it.
4.0,They not thick enough
4.0,Beautiful but runs very small.  My daughter wears a size xs or small but had to get this in a medium.  Well made though.
4.0,It perfectly fit to Navihawk to replace rubber band. Just on first touch you can feel poor quality of material and just it is not that like it was before...
4.0,What does a turtle and love sign have to do with PR just because the colors are there doesn’t mean it’s PR
4.0,"Really liked these. I actually used them as winter gloves (driving and light use). They fit well and had great grip and protection. Easy to get on and off. I realize these aren't made for general use - especially during winter, but overall pretty good. However, only after a month or so, the conductive thread in the fingers fell out making them not so useful for me anymore. I'll reserve them for my summertime mountain biking now."
4.0,Wish the packaging made it look nicer
4.0,Warm material and fits well
4.0,Just what I needed for my Jasmine costume!  Lightweight and shimmery however it is a little pricey for such thin earrings
4.0,"Love this coat! Great quality! Waiting for the winter to try it! It is not white but Ivory, anyways I love it. Golden buttons which does not seem as good quality as the coat itself, they look like could loose the gold; but for the price and the protection I don't have complains!"
4.0,"Not wgat i expected,  thought they would have been a little heavier, but it served it's purpose."
4.0,It fits well the only problem is the straps on the black one (I ordered the white one first) are a little longer than the straps on the white one. But I just wear a black tank top under it and it works ok.
4.0,"The coat is wonderfully warm! It does run a little small, and I received a black coat instead of the Navy blue that I ordered."
4.0,I'm still wearing them. It helps with the pain.
4.0,Soft stretchy material. Will order same one again.
4.0,"Attractive Peach color, fairly see through lightweight fabric.  Flirty and fun."
4.0,"I ordered this dress at the last minute for our 1950s themed Christmas. It arrived quickly. I was a little worried because I read a lot of reviews about a bad zipper. Mine was just fine. No problem at all. The dress was a beautiful rich green. Very wrinkled, but that’s to be expected since it was shipped in a bag. I used a little hand steamer. It helped a lot. I didn’t get them all out because of time, but let it hang, and it looked fine for me. I ordered a 4xl which seems huge size wise but it matched their measurements posted. FYI you will not get the flair without a crinoline, but it was fine without. Nice when you spin.  It was sewn fine. But it is a mostly cotton dress and feels like it. Not soft like supima. Overall, I loved it and would order again."
4.0,"#1 This product is awesome. After some getting used to its the same speed as setting up using a traditional rack.<br /><br />#2 The racks come out super tight and consistent. It really makes a huge difference.<br /><br />#3 My seller ‘Game Room Authority’ used ZERO packaging protection. Subsequently, mine arrived bent and damaged. It still works, but I’m required to orient it one single way. I’d totally buy this again, but I’d avoid ‘Game Room Authority’."
4.0,"I honestly wasn’t expecting much since the price was pretty low for this type of dress. However,  I was pleasantly surprised when I received it in the mail. It fits pretty good, I’m 155 lbs and 5,6 and I ordered a medium. The zipper won’t go up the last two inches, so that kinda sucks. But, I initially wanted a really low backless dress, so I plan on hemming the back lower anyway, so the zipper issue really doesn’t matter."
4.0,"These earrings are really cute.  I've been wanting this style for a while, and I really like them.  My only complaint is I have very thin ear lobes so sometimes I hava to squish the earrings a little so they stay up better.  But overall they are really nice."
4.0,"I purchased for an Aunt who has trouble reading prescriptions, not it's intended purpose, and it not work well, so I keep, seems to work okay as intended."
4.0,"Extra soft & comfortable, size runs big so pulling at neck/shoulders most of day."
4.0,"friendsd like them,"
4.0,"I purchased the XL based on another reviewer's recommendation to buy a size up from what you would normally buy. The sleeves are nice and long even after the first wash. It's somewhat of a slim fit, which is good for a 6'4&#34; slim build."
4.0,I have been looking for 1/4 zip sweatshirt type for some time. this was a little long but it didn't come in petite and it's very comfortable.  Not too heavy.  I like it.
4.0,Lov the case
4.0,So far my daughter seems to really like this a prefer it over the masks that go over the ears. This one seems to be easier for her to do daily activities as well.
4.0,"I would have rated this 4.5 but can't figure out how to get system to let me do that. The lettering and image were clear, the shirt is a little thinner material than expected but not see thru...it is cool and breathable material. Just a tad smaller than expected but still fit the person it was gifted to....she was very happy with it."
4.0,"I purchased and of December, arrived early January mid February  bottom soul split in ball of shoe<br /> Disappointed. Otherwise fantastic boot."
4.0,"So I’m typically a large and thought that I would order it my size assuming it was going to be big from the start. Please order it a size bigger. While it fit smaller than expected, it still fit me pretty snug. Personally I found the product to be worth it."
4.0,"It would be getting five stars if I had received the shoulder strap..<br />Otherwise, I have received compliments galore about this purse."
4.0,I now own 2 pair of these jeans. Great fit. Comfortable. Love the stretch fabric
4.0,I liked it. Got compliments all day.
4.0,"Pros: This dress is true to size and very well-made. The lace is very delicate and beautiful. The length of this dress is great. I am 5’ 7” and it hit me right above the knees. It twirls very nicely and is very feminine.<br /><br />Cons: The only downside of this dress for me was that it was not as structured as the photo makes it out to be. I had to altar the waist to fit better, but it may just be my body type.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great dress for the price!"
4.0,"I received these as a gift and they are lovely- the print is so adorable and classic and gets me in the holiday mood. I am usually a 6.5 or 7 and these fit fine- they don't slip off, but I can feel that there is extra room for size 8 feet. I pad around in these all day. They are very well-made and the tread is good. Highly recommend!"
4.0,I liked the see through quality.  The are easy to get on and durable to use. My hands are visible.
4.0,"Fits well. Cute and comfortable. I am 5'7&#34; 170lbs, 34DD bra size and I ordered a large."
4.0,"These do the job that they are supposed to do; compress your calves. I purchased the Large with the expectation that they may be too large for me (I have chicken legs). They are very tight, especially trying to get over wider feet. If they had an XL I would've switched to that size. So when buying you will probably be best thinking the size you want is gonna be a bit smaller than what you think."
4.0,"Hello,I would give this band 5 stars but it is a bit short,nonetheless I will visit a local leather shop and get an additional matching hole or two added towards the end to accommodate my thick wrists.It will have just enough &#34;tounge&#34;to reach the first loop but that's o.k..I really enjoy this watchbands' appearance, well done!R.K."
4.0,"Thankfully I read all of the reviews prior to ordering. I'm 5'10&#34;, I ended up ordering an XL which fit nicely, definitely a bodycon dress.  I ordered the white one which was very see-through.... make sure you invest in some good shape wear for this.  Overall, I'd say it's nice... I've received a ton of compliments on it.  I was going to order it in another color, but I wasn't too fond of the material. Definitely hand wash/ dry only... this material WILL SHRINK. =/"
4.0,Love these glasses! Fun shape and lightweight
4.0,"SELLER REPLACED FIRST BAND AT NO CHARGE, SECOND BAND ARRIVED ABOUT A WEEK AGO UNFORTUNATELY I HAD ALREADY PURCHASED ONE FROM A COMPETITOR SO I REALLY HAVE NO USE FOR IT NOW BUT I DID TEST IT OUT AND IT SEEMED TO BE EASIER TO INSTALL AND REMOVE SO I AM UPDATING MY FEEDBACK."
4.0,"If we’re all going to roll the dice on a One Size Fits All sweater, at least there could be some reviews with size information to help!<br />So — she’s 5’9”, 140 lbs, 34A/B.<br />~The sweater sleeves are similar to a 3/4 length sleeve.<br />~For a OSFA, the sleeves could have been longer & then shorter arms can fold the cuff back. As is, they’ll just be the awkward length on some.<br />~The overall length is short, similar to cropped, which is fine on her.<br />(The photo is taken wearing it over a jumpsuit,  so it’s hard to tell where it lands on her but it’s definitely cropped length.)<br />The knit is thin but not chintzy & fairly soft.<br /><br />Her preference is to wear it unbuttoned - definitely a casual sweater that would look cute with a white tank or cami underneath & some jeans!<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it’s Helpful!**"
4.0,Nice good looking bracelet.
4.0,"Product was delivered quickly and looks just like the online photo.  Purchased for 3 yr grandaughter.  The waist is a little too big for her (she's small for her age), but we  took it in with needle and thread just a little.  As the product description mentioned, this tutu will work for a number of ages and sizes.  Nicely finished, great price.  Grandaughter loves tutus!"
4.0,Husband said they were comfortable but too small. I would have returned them had I nd washed them first
4.0,"Going to have to get a few links taken out, as it's a bit big for my wrist. But otherwise it's a nice watch, especially at this price point."
4.0,Size is good but the front is totally see through while the back is not
4.0,Such a cute dress and beautiful colors. I was under the impression that it would have clothing on the inside on the ruffles but it doesn’t so I had to get a matching set of pants. But other than that my daughter loved it all.
4.0,I ordered a medium and it definitely has a looser fit that I don’t appreciate with this type of fabric since it’s already loose and flowy and doesn’t accentuate well.. maybe I’d like a size small better but honestly the snake pattern wasn’t for me
4.0,"Picked this up because of the Seiko movement, inexpensive beater that has worked great for a few years. Battery was just replaced after 3 years service. The mesh band was a hair grabber until it loosened up after a day or two's wear, but besides that no complaints.  Nice silvery blue dial, lugs are solid, band easily adjusted, looks good on the wrist."
4.0,I was hoping it would be shinier but the fabric is more crepey than satiny
4.0,"Looks great with the dress, came with a small stain on the tulle, but since it's underneath the dress and won't be seen, it's not worth returning.  Fits perfect!"
4.0,low price. rear clasp also has some swivel. son loves them for swim class
4.0,My wife loves it pendant seems to have some minor scuffs on it but still looks great.
4.0,Size 22 bought a 24 just to size up Incase and they are a little big but still soooo cute. My favorite pair of jeans. Only down side is how big the ankles are.
4.0,"I have worn the two smaller sizes every day since I got them- never taking them out. And they are still shining and like new. Haven't dulled a bit, which I love about them. The clasp is excellent, they have not come undone, even while in the shower. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because I wish there was one size smaller- since the middle size is a bit big for my tastes. But other than that, excellent earrings, especially for the price!"
4.0,"This hat is very cute.  I've been looking for something similar for more than a year.  I'd have liked it to be just a little looser in the weave, and the headband part of the hat is quite a bit smaller than the overall circumference, so if you don't wear it just right you can end up looking like you have a mushroom on your head.  Overall just the right amount of warm, style and comfort on walks in cool (but not frigid) weather."
4.0,"I like these but they do have some strange seam patterns. One seem runs right down your crotch. The fabric is greath, more cloth-like than spandex felling. No complaints!"
4.0,"My only note is that I wish this was zippered instead of buttons. A squirmy baby make a cute glow-in-the-dark skeleton, but hard to change diapers."
4.0,"Ears are a bit floppy, but my daughter likes it. She says bunny ears are supposed to be floppy. :)"
4.0,This is a really good quality necklace and look good as well. For my age and taste it is too big.
4.0,Love this product! Slightly short on torso length but still would buy again as I wear it in cold weather so usually under a tshirt or hoody.
4.0,good quality  Good price
4.0,I liked the dress overall but it did not fit well on me. I am 5'10&#34;. The dress came to my ankles. That wouldn't have been a problem if I could have zipped the dress up completely. For me it was too small around the bust.
4.0,"Nice luster and color on the pearls. The sapphires are faceted but seem to be a pretty rough cut. They are very dark in color. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4.0,Nice bracelet but a bit too pricey. Solid on one side and hollow on the reverse. Photo misleading
4.0,The size is crazy and hard to insure you order the proper size using the chart provided by the seller.  I know now to order a Chinese XXXL in order to get a XL.  The shirt is very nice but had to take a star for the size.
4.0,"Ok sandals, they don't seem to be very comfortable, but my son doesn't mind wearing them either.  Can't really complain since the price was right!"
4.0,"I bought it for my aunt and she loveeeeee it.<br />Martial is rich,worth every dime"
4.0,This dress fits true to size and is very comfortable.
4.0,"I received this dress promptly.  It looks like the picture.  Price was right.  Just one little flaw: the elastic waistband was twisted inside.  Fortunately, I know how to sew, and I was able to undo the seam and fix it.  For the price, I was able to take the extra step without too much resentment. Still, if I didn't have those skills, it would have been problematic."
4.0,"This is perfect for my daughter, she can’t stand being cold in the pool. It still allows for a great range of movement, great deal! Good sizing."
4.0,"I was very impressed by the appearance and the soft fabric this hat is made out of. I've never seen a design quite like this before. It was very unique and looks just like the picture! This was meant to be a gift for my brother and he enjoyed the overall look and feel of the hat. However, the size was a bit small for his liking. I tried to adjust the snaps to the very last one and he still felt it was little tight on the sides. Other than that, it was an enjoyable addition to his collection.<br /><br />Complimentary product received for an honest review."
4.0,Nice fabric but my child only liked one of the designs
4.0,"A bit heavy on my head, but the size is good"
4.0,Very comfortable and flexible
4.0,Cute dress but I should’ve went down a size. I’m US 12 and option was XL for 12/14 but was too big. I will stick with a L when I order certain clothing.
4.0,"These are PERFECT for my yoga/ exercise. They are slightly snug on me but ever so comfy. I'm 5'7 158lbs and bought the large, I could have done an XL and been ok too but a M would have been too tight for me. I do prefer more of a loose fit, I'm not a fan of the skin tight fit. But these will get plenty of use, for sure!"
4.0,"Didn’t really know what to expect with these but immediately loved them upon trying them on. They are buttery soft velvet, they are fitted around the waist, hips and thighs, but flare out quite nicely from there. I think I’ll be pairing these with a white button up and some strappy heels."
4.0,"This was a gift to an otter lover and they loved it. Sadly, the chain was really weak and broke after a day of carrying it around :("
4.0,Tends to slide off of the shoulders so it needs to be pinned in place. But looks great.
4.0,"Very cute! My two year old twirled around for minutes when I tried it on her. The difference in oranges between the pumpkin and skirt bothers my extreme type A brain, but it’s very cute and she loves it! It did not have a tag for washing/drying instructions, though..."
4.0,Like the fit and thickness of this product to wear as a slip under dresses and skirts. My personal preferences would not enable me to wear it as a dress but will serve my purpose well.
4.0,"I just received this shirt today. It is super cute! I got a medium, and I am 5'9 at 140 pounds. It fits a little loose around the torso, but the arms are a little snug. That's why I didn't give it five stars. No real complaints, though!"
4.0,Love this dress fit really true to size
4.0,looks better in person than on the web site very nice
4.0,This top is really cute. I don't think it said it was Junior cut in the description though and I had to go up a size because the waist was tight.
4.0,It’s little thigh around her legs but it works great for my 7 month old. She is able to crawl more and doesn’t get tired
4.0,Not bad for the price. Pretty colors
4.0,This is really cute on. The only thing is the lights get annoying after awhile. Otherwise it would have 5 stars
4.0,The buttons are not real. I wanted the functional buttons to make nursing easier. These are not real buttons. It is super cute and very comfortable though.
4.0,This is a well made necklace which does what it says. I gave it 4 stars rather that 5 because it is not shipped in a jewelry box. It comes in a shrink wrap tube placed in a flimsy cellophane bag. It took 4 hours to get the tube off. The necklace has a unique fastener which makes it better than others. It does not have a lobster claw or spring clip and is much easier for those with arthritis to use.
4.0,"It's soft and stretchy.  Has a button for a fly (for guys) so if you're a girl like me, just be careful with that, maybe sew it shut.  Very comfy!"
4.0,The product is super cute! The earrings however are on the heavy side. Make your earlobes droopy.
4.0,"Although I am 5'7"" and slim, the wide cut through the thighs and calves wasn't greatly flattering.  I had a tailor cut it down for me because I loved the color and fabric.  Maybe it's because I am short-waisted.  The slim version was much more flattering for me.  Perhaps it would be better for people who buy relaxed cuts through the hips and thighs."
4.0,great construction for the price.
4.0,This is my second jacket.  My daughter took my first one.  The zipper sticks on both of them but is super cute and flattering
4.0,This is for sure beautiful. The color is so rich and vibrant. Not for plus size.
4.0,Great fit ! Hides that muffin top . Fabric is soft and lightweight .
4.0,Loved the top.  The fit is great and I love the length.  Looks great with red jewelry.  Very trendy but a little pricey.
4.0,Really pricey looking! Except the candy canes...they looked like ones you get from a juggle gum machine. 😊
4.0,wish i could get xxl sise
4.0,"I am 5’ 6” about 140lbs, a size medium and I have a really hard time finding bottoms that fit. These bottoms fit my butt size and also my hip size well. I ordered a M and a L just to be safe and I am keeping both because I love them.<br />They are really comfy to wear around the house, but be prepared if you go to take out the trash or walk the dogs around the block, your butt cheeks will be out saying hello."
4.0,"Pretty cool belt have had it for about a week. The material is really nice, but some of the stitching is slightly apparent on the face of the belt. I'm a size 30 waist but with the thickness of clothing the smallest size of 32 fits well on the second to last hole. Will update review in a month or so once the leather is broken in. For the price the belt is aesthetically very well worth it."
4.0,with this price its good
4.0,"I initially ordered 3 if these in Medium. They were slightly larger than I would have liked but fit well enough to not exchange for a smaller size. I have found myself throwing one of these on every day for work since the day I got them (I work from home). I have ordered more so I can wear every day of the week. They are quite practical in that they are very very comfortable (feel like a long t-shirt), they are cut in a way that conservative enough for a work environment without being dowdy, and they are multi-season - meaning I think they are light enough to wear in warmer weather and easily serve as a base layer in cooler weather. I have also easily transitioned from zoom calls to running a quick errand or meeting up for a quick bite with friends (just throw on some earrings and maybe a belt if I am feeling fancy) and always get compliments."
4.0,I bough this for myself. I tend to like men’s v neck sweaters better because I know the v won’t be plunging. I’ve worn t a few times it’s a good quality sweater but I’ve gotten a hole in the armpit inseam. Easy fix. It was a nice texture to it as well.
4.0,My son wore this to school for tie dye day. I’m not crafty so I was glad I found this and it arrived quickly and on time. He got a lot of compliments on it. Cute.
4.0,fit tight in legs
4.0,"Nice wallet for the price.  It's a little bulky compared to the Dockers brand I was using (lasted 12 years) but still acceptable considering I keep my wallet in my front pocket.  It has two more credit card pockets that my previous wallet and I really like the double sided ID holder.  Overall, good buy if you like a bi-fold wallet."
4.0,Be careful when ordering. Order one size larger
4.0,Well made and nice. I wish it opened a little wider or it would have 5 stars
4.0,beautiful pattern and very comfortable fit.
4.0,"I got this to wear to a wedding, and I've worn it several other times since.  It's pretty and loose enough that it moves comfortably on my wrist but not so loose I'm afraid it will fall off."
4.0,Awesome.. You can adjust it to how puffy you want it.. It has the wire that are movable.. You can make it a Aline or ball gown dress.
4.0,"I like how you can turn the earrings for different ""looks"" - you can wear them so they hang straight down, but you can also wear them sideways.  I think these earrings are very cute, however the posts are rather thick, which personally I'm not a fan of."
4.0,Needed it for medical procedure and worked out well
4.0,"I use this clutch whenever I go out and I love it! Cute, great size (not too big or too small). My only complaint is that the chain does break pretty easily if it gets caught on something. I've already had to fix it twice. But for the price I would buy this again."
4.0,Definitely order a size or two up.
4.0,This is my second time for ordering this style. I am 60 plus and heavy chested. This top fits well without exposing too much.
4.0,Fits well on small and average size faces. It smudges quite easily so keep that in mind
4.0,"These are great shoes for a 70s party. Sizing is accurate. Because they are plastic (remember jelly shoes?) they make your feet sweat. Super cute and comfy,  though."
4.0,"I was very surprised! Despite the good reviews I was still skeptical, but I was proved wrong! I actually like the material feeling like work out clothes. Very comfortable and different from other dresses I have. Provides a casual look you can pair with sneakers. Fairly priced, fit as expected. I’m very petite and short (under 5ft) and a Small fit nice and loose which is what I wanted. Overall a good buy. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is I wish it was a tad shorter."
4.0,"This inspirational keychain is the size of a quarter and is pretty basic. It's good quality metal that will serve well, but the inscription is what makes it special. Good pick me up gift for loved ones."
4.0,"Super comfy, perfect butt coverage (not a fan of cheeky bikinis, myself)."
4.0,Really love this bathing suit! I got a medium and it fits me well. Just a tiny bit too tight but not too tight. Happy with it other than that!
4.0,Works well so far. Seems powerful enough. Glad i made the purchase.
4.0,Very light material for spring-
4.0,"Love the look of this coat on my daughter. It is so cute I wanted to buy my younger daughter one as well. The only complaint that I have is that one of the string came off of the pocket of the coat but my daughter is a little bit rough. She is 12 years old and it's perfect! My daughter is about 5""0 and 100 lbs. I would purchase again."
4.0,"pro<br />soft, comfy, and good price<br /><br />con<br />very thin"
4.0,It is well made and very cute. The only reason I took a star away is that there is no reason we shouldn't be able to pick a color.
4.0,The pro is that you can avoid the marks that usually goes in the belt and it look well. The cons is that Im afraid what I'm going to do is the mechanism fails!
4.0,"Well, the ears are kind of sideways.  It's like the person who designed it, or whoever assembled it, doesn’t know how kitty ears sit on a cat's head.  Other than that, it's well made and warm."
4.0,"Buena calidad, pero vienen combinadas las tallas, no venían todos en la misma talla que ordené"
4.0,"I bought a camel color and it's a good quality product. Well made and wonderful details. Many people ask me where I bought it or what brand it is and they are all surprised when I said it's a $60 bag from Amazon because it looks pretty fancy. Goes well with both casual and dress-up. My only complaint is it's quite small (I have to squeeze in my phone, purse, lipstick and little compact powder.) Also it's kind of hard to open and close the bag because the leather is pretty thick but overall I recommend it if you look for a small cross bag."
4.0,I liked this chain a lot. The rose gold really gives it a real look and feel- nice work.
4.0,"I love the material. It does stretch, but you should order one size up to have a comfortable fit."
4.0,i like its looks nice but the lines may fade over time.
4.0,"This is a nice dress appropriate for multiple occasions in warms seasons. I ordered one in gray and upon receipt and fitting I ordered the red one. For reference, I typically wear a size 16 misses or 14/16 plus. I ordered this in size 2X for excellent fit. I gave four stars as the fabric will get wrinkled somewhat easy."
4.0,"A bit tighter than I would've preferred, but it still fit. 5'6&#34; and 135lbs. Got a medium but could've gotten a large. Good quality for the money."
4.0,My son likes the swim shorts.They fit him good.
4.0,Están hermosos.  Solo que yo pedí el número  6 y llego el 8
4.0,"Love this skirt! The only pain is there are two slits and not one so the front of the skirt sometimes get caught between my legs when walking. However, the color, material and design and gorgeous. I get so many compliments every time I wear it."
4.0,Nice little dress. Will be ordering from this brand again
4.0,"These may be the most comfortable pajamas I have ever had!  Its too warm still in  California to be wearing them so will need to wait for colder months to really use them.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they are a little sheer.  Thankfully, the top is long enough to give some coverage in the ""nether regions"".  I didn't see other color options, but dang!  I'd definitely buy these again in some darker colors.  Really, really comfortable and very true to size."
4.0,I’ve gotten compliments on them. Love them but  the excess chain is something that’s uncomfortable for me so I made the adjustments it flopped into my shoes while walking. Probably should remove the excess or clip twice to shorten the excess.
4.0,I like the jacket but it is quite short in the back. The pictures are a bit deceiving with regards to the length.
4.0,"Wore this on a very lengthy overseas trip. being able to store passport, tickets, phone, and more in pockets were a great space saver and convenient. Lightweight. Stylist."
4.0,"They fit my child great, but the extra pieces that clipped into the holes did t fit right so we lost a couple of them and my daughter was quite sad. If they are on sale I would recommend buying them, but wouldn’t pay full price because the pieces fall off too easy."
4.0,So cute i loved it.
4.0,Second pair I bought. First pair held up well.
4.0,I'm not sure why these are labeled for boys. They are suitable for all children.  The inside lining is bright pink. They are a bit larger than I would have expected....they are essentially the same size as another pair of Nike cleats my daughter has which are labeled a half size bigger.
4.0,Material abit thin but I like the fit and true to its size
4.0,loved the dress but the fit is too small; great dress for a small to average size; i normally wear 16-18 and this was much too tight
4.0,"Very soft and comfortable. I'm 5'4&#34; and 185 lbs. I'm a little thick around the middle. The M-L fit well. The only drawback is they are see through, but it's hard to find leggings that aren't."
4.0,"I bought this, love the hand.... but broke the screw already. The first day! How do I get a replacement??"
4.0,"These earring are super cute and light, fun and 4 pairs for the price can't be beat but one of the earnings came slightly damaged. Doesn't affect the overall look but I hope that it does not break!"
4.0,"Me gusto, y por ese precio más"
4.0,"The material is T-shirt like, not like a sweatshirt."
4.0,Good fit. comfortable. Holds up the washings.
4.0,I would've gave it 5 stars but it wasn't the exact colors. My top half is grey with stars. I'm still going to wear it because it's cute. No time to send back.
4.0,"The arrival was a bit late, two days late actually. However, when it arrived it fit perfectly so order your size. This isn't one of those print on t-shirts where you can literally feel the design through your shirt, it's actually IN the fabric, which is good.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with it at all, just wish shipping was a bit faster."
4.0,"Super cute perfect for phone, money, credit cards, a cute little club purse! The gold chain is adjustable which will be a good wallet for my darker bags"
4.0,It was a little funny on me but I did gain a little weight! 😁
4.0,I wear/use these everyday. The taste gets fuzzy and less tall ale like and more Pom Pom risk but it's great!
4.0,"it's a nice case ,but a little bit small"
4.0,"I read the reviews before purchasing this garment and they were correct , it does run small. I ordered a xl/xxl and it is a chore to get it on.  I wear a size 10 pants so you be the judge.  I don’t know how well it will hold up or if it will lose its stretch because I just received it and I am wearing it for the first time. I’ll post at a later date and let you know the results."
4.0,"Great idea. Installation is hard, and the pins don’t stay in well. I ended up using a strong epoxy to glue them on to the watch body. Highly recommend that approach if the watch is used outdoors"
4.0,"Had gotten these for traveling abroad.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about some of the stitching, and the locking feature of the handles was stubborn at times. But these made a round-trip around the globe with several flight turnovers and survived! No issues with the locks.<br /><br />Be aware that if you plan to use these for international travel, the largest suitcase may be too big for your flight. I'd played it safe and used the two smaller ones on my trip after looking up the size regulations of my airline. If I were to order suitcases again, I would probably go with a pair of medium-sized hard cases instead."
4.0,"Good deal, pockets are a little rigid but loosen up after a while.  It is nice that you can leave your license in the clear pocket so you don't have to take it out all the time."
4.0,Gift...to a child.  Appear nice
4.0,"Very nice scrubs by this company.  Does need a little touch up ironing.  Other than that, great scrubs. Love the color accents."
4.0,These slippers run small and tight. My husband was looking for an easy comfy slipper. I would recommend ordering a size up. That's what we did and now he loves them.
4.0,Absolutely beautiful pattern and the quality seems great. However they are very very high waisted. You need to be curvy to wear this. Not flattering on someone with minimal hips like me.
4.0,Surprisingly cute and substantial for earrings under $10. I'll likely wear them all the time.
4.0,They run very big.
4.0,"My fiance completely loved it, she was smiling ear to ear, they were beautiful and had a nice weight to them, and she also loved the clip on the back"
4.0,"The size is excellent for daily use, color is fun (pretty, but doesn't match anything I have), plenty of organization.  Not my favorite purse, the material is a bit too slick, but I like it and use it often."
4.0,"Nice fit and very warm, I use it under my hard hat and it is comfortable"
4.0,I cant figure out how to tighten the wristband. The tiny screwdriver included does not fit the part it ia meant for.
4.0,"Soft, flattering, and very comfortable."
4.0,"Very nice watch for the money. If you’re new to watches or a collector who likes automatic watches, this is one to consider. It’s classy looking, fit and finish are good for this price point, and the Seiko NH35A movement is reliable."
4.0,These are pretty rings.. I bought this because I was considering buying a real gold ring and thought I ll try this out with cheap infinity ring alternative to see how I feel. Worked great for that purpose.
4.0,"beautiful pearls, but buyer couldn't visualize, so really too small!  order a size larger!"
4.0,Fits great! Fabric is thinner than expected and doesn’t look like the same material as the picture - also a lot darker in color. Good for wearing around the house.
4.0,This shirt is good quality but it's more of a hot pink than mauve.
4.0,"Gorgeous, but too short for all 5 feet and 8 inches"
4.0,Nice watch amazing color
4.0,"Fabric wasn't what I expected, but they are plain, simple shorts"
4.0,"Had a milky color, I thinned out and it cleared up.  Used on cork coasters but would be great on fishing poles etc.!"
4.0,A little loose and the threads pull but at 10 bucks it does the job and I get lots of compliments.
4.0,I got a different item than the one I ordered but it’s cool i still like the one you sent!
4.0,The butterfly is really cute!
4.0,"it looks like a safety glasses at work<br />and not comfy at all, but I guess it does what it suppose to"
4.0,Not like the expensive brand but pretty good
4.0,"Took some time to get used to it. It's rather tight with about 6 cards (DL, Discover, MC, etc) but love that the wallet and money clip are so compact!"
4.0,"This is a cute necklace. It isn't the most elegant, but it is pretty and could probably be jazzed up a bit. Overall though, it is a nice piece and would be a good stocking stuffer."
4.0,Good compression socks. No problems
4.0,"Great product, the only downside is that it fades off"
4.0,Have my brother this gift for his leather jacket.
4.0,gift for my son. he loved it.
4.0,Emblem is metal a little heavy. My really likes it
4.0,"Me hubiera gustado el short solo con el elástico en la cintura, sin el cordón que ajusta, pues ese lazo por fuera lo desluce"
4.0,GREAT SUMMER PANTS
4.0,Glasses were great. Just like the picture! Very cool and looked great on me. A bit hard to see in the sun but loved the color.
4.0,"I like that is true to size, but I didn't like how the straps are, they are kind of flimsy. I feel that if I pull too hard they are gonna snap off. For the price is a great product. I have purchased slimming body suits that have cost me as much as $80 dollars and they don't work. I definately recomend this one. I can't wait for them to get the nude one back in stock."
4.0,"Pretty good item, my wife really liked it and it is hard to find anything that is made of gold plating and has orange on it.  So far so good."
4.0,It's exactly as advertised.
4.0,Very stylish purse but the shoulder strap could have been longer. Size and quality good for the price. Appears as advertised. Cute bag.
4.0,"I really like this product the only thing I would change would be to make the strap a bit more secure, I’ve had it fall off several times."
4.0,"These are super easy to put into your kid's shoes.  They stretch enough, which is great.  They are fabric, and not plastic.  The size small fit my kid's size 11 shoe without trouble.  They are one long lace with metal prongs on the end.  The metal prongs fit through the holes without any trouble.  He hasn't worn them out and about yet, but they look great!"
4.0,"I bought two packs and I love it. It's soft and comfortable. I'm 5'1 and the small pairs fit well, but they are a bit stretchy so as long as you adjust it while putting on pants then your set to go with no worries."
4.0,This necklace arrived in a nice blue box.  It's a nice designn and nice quality except when it's flipped over the anchor isn't solid which takes away from the whole look.
4.0,"Beautiful ring. However the sizing is definitely a little off. I even used the measurements that go along with the item and it was still about a half size too small 🙁<br />I would recommend getting a size up. I do love it and will continue to wear it, but unfortunately i can’t wear it as much as I’d like because of the fit.<br /><br />Edit: I am a woman, I use my bfs account. I ordered a size 8."
4.0,"Texture is soft but sturdy and there's plenty of room to toss big things like water bottles into it without even taking it off your shoulder. However, each strap is made of two strips so it can be unwieldy and difficult to grab all four strips at once and then keep all that material in place on your shoulder. The most frustrating feature is that with the extra straps and the way the bag is shaped at the top it can be an ordeal to hold it open to get a good look at what's in the bag. Still like it overall despite the bit of frustration."
4.0,"It's beautiful, but to small."
4.0,"I really do like these glasses. They are a little big for my face but the description did say XXL so that's on me. Super sturdy, I feel like I could chuck these across the room and they wouldn't get a scratch.<br />The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the one lens has a tiny defect, it's a little black spot about the size of a pin top but it's right in my line of vision so I keep thinking something is stuck to them. Once I realized it was part of the film I just stopped paying attention to it.<br />I would probably buy another pair from this seller again."
4.0,Smaller than described...but they are pretty & seem to be well made
4.0,"I’m 5’7 / 125lbs / 27inch waist. I got the XS size. The color shirts I got were Black,Dark Blue,White. I can understand why maybe other buyers didn’t like these shirts due to the material perhaps not being the best but listen this shirts are good! They get the job done, they look stylish! I guess my only wish was that this shirts were a little bit slimmer from the waist but hey maybe it’s probably me who needs to grow more lol anyways I would buy these again if I have to, I’ll wait untill my 3 shirts ware out and most likely purchase them again & try different colors. I hope my review helps you."
4.0,"It fit great, my only issue was that I received the package opened. Nothing was missing, just didn’t like that it was opened."
4.0,Perfect for outdoor weddings! Really helpful considering the mess I could've gotten myself into. Will probably buy more for the future.
4.0,"runs a little small but soft, nice quality, quick delivery"
4.0,These fit my husband's large glasses fine and he really likes them.
4.0,Is a bit large but the pattern is very pretty
4.0,Bust area little tight
4.0,They only reason for my rate is that it doesn’t say “I open at close” and it could’ve said it… why doe I say that? Because they engraved that it is made in china in the same place where “I open at close” goes…
4.0,"i liked them, they seemed to be good quality and sturdy. i got a medium and it was wayyy too big for my face, but thats mostly my fault for getting the wrong size."
4.0,Really impressed with the quality of this necklace especially considering the price. It's still fragile and I have had to fix one of the jump rings so far but that could be because I was using it for a music video and we were running up and down mountains :) It was an easy fix and my client is really happy with it!
4.0,Nice long strap. Zippers open and close well. The main bag is a tight fit for my Kindle Fire HDX.
4.0,"A bit heavy and would like them more if the backs weren’t just silicone backs, but they’re super cute so overall I’m happy with them!"
4.0,"PLEASE NOTE: YOU MEASURE YOUR ARM, NOT your height and weight to measure as some of you have asked or left a review.  I bought the Medium size. Fits a little snug, but fine. My Bicep measures about 11.5 inches (kinda skinny), My wrist is about 8 inches, and my arm is about 18.5 inches. So if you are bigger in the biceps/wrist, you might want to look for the Large. You can always exchange it within the 30 days with Prime."
4.0,"This is really light it came with the heart out I had to glue it back on but it's still cute for causal ware, antique looking"
4.0,Liked color and ease of set up
4.0,Love the pocket.  Made of great material.
4.0,"Shipped fast. Fit my watch very easily. Looks/feels amazing. Only complaint is how easily the clasp gets hooked on things and ""pops off."" Could very easily lose my watch and not realize it. Other than that, works great and fits like a glove"
4.0,"They're the right size for my big head and, excluding the dull blue, I like this particular group of colors."
4.0,"This Gladdon Moda Shoulder Bag is a nice contemporary bag that has enough room to carry everything you need. It's a bit larger than most of the bags that I carry, but I have two daughters and a granddaughter who will love it. It is made of PU leather [fake leather] that is easily cleaned. There is an outside pocket where you can put your cell phone or anything else that you need to get to quickly. It comes with a clear duffle type backpack, too. Although this isn't my favorite bag, it is a nice bag that will work for anyone who likes larger bags."
4.0,Nice shirt but had to return should have bought one size up
4.0,Nice fit and material for the price. I have large thighs and a small waist so the 42 fit perfectly around my legs and thighs and I had to have the wait taken in. Will definitely make more purchases from this seller
4.0,"I really love these! Perfect fit! However the stone came out after only wearing it for a few hours, which was a bummer. Not a cute now."
4.0,"Not as good as they used to be, my old ones would last a year or more with quite a bit of use, these new ones are sown a bit different side by side just not the same level of quality.. but still much better than any other brands I’ve tried out, still gonna keep buying these."
4.0,You have to know what it is because there isn’t a label or instructions of what it does. Just comes in a plastic bag. Hard to give as a gift if they do not know what it is.
4.0,It’s really thick ......very hot.  Would work get in winter
4.0,"ordered one size larger ,a beautiful fit."
4.0,I’m short and was still expecting it to be above the ankle based off others reviews. Kept since they fit good. I’ll either figure a way to alter them or keep looking for the perfect shoes for them.
4.0,Stays thin
4.0,Love the shirt but the sizing was way off
4.0,Very cute so I kept the top but it was too big.
4.0,"Great product for the price. They are a little stiff, but once you wear them for a while they're all good. Also, the times have not reset on either watch not even with me taking them off as some reviewers have stated."
4.0,Cute and worth the price but ran a little large
4.0,"I was looking forward in wearing the bright summer colors, but it's cut is on the smaller side.  My wife pointed out how well it was constructed.  Just an incentive to get it to fit correctly."
4.0,I used this mask on the plane and I was able to drink and eat certain foods very easily with.
4.0,"I needed a water shoe that had rubber around the top part of the toe as my 5 yr old scrapes her feet on the bottom of the pool but also, most other fabrics rip around her toe within 10 mins. These lasted a lot of pool hrs and are still going!"
4.0,Love it the baby loves it we get many compliments and asked where we got it.<br />We don't have to fight with her to keep it on unlike others.<br />Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the February 23 delivery date we were given. It was delivered 2 weeks after the order. We will purchase another one in future.
4.0,A bit too tight around the ankle. My son is 4 and I get him 5-7yrs socks and they fit his feet perfectly
4.0,My girlfriend got this and thinks the watch is stunning for its price! “Fits great; not tight at all and feels really comfortable. I just wish the light would have an option to stay lit for a longer time period.”
4.0,Most satisfactory.  Silvered gradient hippie sunglasses--exactly as expected..
4.0,Product works as expected. Not a fashion statement but functional
4.0,Cute shoes:) They are a bit on the wide side but overall they are cute:)
4.0,"Helps in washing dishes with hot water and scrubbing light stains. Also suitable for small adult hands. Giving a 4 star because after 6 uses, one of the gloves has slight leakage."
4.0,"Really cute and well made, But runs a tad small."
4.0,I'm giving this as a gift at Christmas. Pretty darn adorable?
4.0,Decent quality and good fun!
4.0,Fun glasses. Too uncomfortable for my giant head but my son loves them.
4.0,"Fabric was nice, just didn’t like the style. It also came smelling very strongly of some scent, like potpourri or something."
4.0,"DEFINATELY size up, but looks great, feels like a decent quality."
4.0,The wrist wrap is held together with a slide in belt buckle without securing belt holes or the little belt rod.  it slips & has moved close to the end of the bracelet a few times.  It would be perfect if I could secure the leather strap.
4.0,These are I've only used one and that's the one with the Bumblebee on it. The little bumblebee has sharp edges and it grabs the fabric and not a good way I'm not sure I'll use it again I haven't used the other ones yet maybe I'll use a little bumblebee one for something else
4.0,"I like the shoe, it is well made and good looking. Arrived on time. I would have given it 5 stars, but they are a bit stiff..."
4.0,"The chest area is very tight, even with the Ds I have. I got the 3X and it does not fit right, but it is so cute, I still wear it"
4.0,"Nice hat,  good construction, top  materials. Med was just too small for me,  even though I'm a 7-1/4, which is at the top of the range for a med."
4.0,"Nice shirts for the price, wish they were tagless but not complaining at this price. Easy wash and wear and the color is nice."
4.0,Super cute jeans! Love how they fit. Glad I ordered one size bigger than what I normally wear.
4.0,I took off a point. Looks like I got a pre opened product. Obvious scotch taped box.
4.0,This band is great for the price but it is not as comfortable as the original band.
4.0,It's a nice thin cool shirt but runs a touch big. I'm a 34 b bust and a small waist I always ware a medium so I'm so happy I got a small!
4.0,"This item was just as the photo shows. Except the material made it a little tight. Tip: Order the next size up, it will fit perfectly."
4.0,"They fit well, I'd probably buy again."
4.0,"Can't wait to use these at the beach. The only thing I can say right now, is they fit small. My daughter is in an infant size 3 atm, so I bought a 3.5. I ended up having to get a 4 for her. Super cute though."
4.0,I could’ve went a size down but still cute.
4.0,Not as long as I expected per the photo.
4.0,"I bought these for a friend of mine, Although the pineapple is almost the same shade of yellow as the background, she loves them. Thank you so much."
4.0,Very cute. We threaded it onto some paracord we used to make a mask lanyard.
4.0,Comfy for bed
4.0,"This dress is beautiful but it doesn't fit well. I'm 5'10 and 145 lbs and usually wear a medium, so that's what I ordered. I think I could have fit into an extra small in ths.  I would give this 5 stars if it fit!"
4.0,"Awesome shipment delivered on time.  Item however runs a bit small.  If normally a medium, I recommend getting one size up.  Satisfied tho. 👌🏽😃"
4.0,The color is a little bit different as it appears on the website
4.0,"They look nice. I've gotten some compliments on them. I wear 1/2 inch or 12.5mm usually and these fit great. My only issue is that the groove for the o-ring seriously irritated my ear. I have thick lobes so maybe the skin got snagged, but after a day of wearing these, both my lobes were sore. This only happened the first time I wore them and I don't wear them for a full day anymore. I do love the color and quality otherwise"
4.0,"I purchased a large, but it didn't fit loosely like it is supposed to. I ended up giving it to my daughter, who is 5'5"" and 100 lbs and it fit her. Very thin material, but to be expected for the price. Overall, it is a great shirt, just size up maybe 2 sizes larger."
4.0,LOVE these earrings. Get tons of compliments on them and they look great with jeans and a sweater! Only thing is - they don’t come with a back and Sometimes they fall off!
4.0,It fit perfect. I love it. I wore it to a wedding and it look so elegant.
4.0,Nice weight.  Had to take it in.  Runs big
4.0,"I got black,  another style and was damaged but I fixed!"
4.0,"I love this bracelet! Very encouraging! The only reason why I took off one start is because graphically, the words should begin with capital letters. Additionally, I don't see the 925 stamp anywhere which makes me think that it's plated. Other than that, it serves a great purpose and it stands out"
4.0,I love how these fit and have stretch
4.0,"Loved it, got lot of compliments too..."
4.0,Very pretty ...  only thing is the cross is so light that it doesn't stay hung well ...  not sure if I'm keeping it .. goes so well with all my heritage hawaiian jewelry argggggg
4.0,"Came larger than expected, I did return it."
4.0,"Quality, cleanliness, and size were perfect.  The only thing is that the color of them appeared to have more of a dark deep purple tint to it than a true brown.  They look nice on my little boy, but the color in person does not match (totally exactly) the color of them in the picture which truly does look like a dark brown (not purplish)."
4.0,"I really love these earrings. I gave only 4 stars because I wish the post was lower, more in the middle, than right at the tippy top of the earring."
4.0,"I was looking for something that would be cool to wear in the summer, and this fit the bill."
4.0,"Love these. Very Cozy, not very Thick, and tend to be slippery on wood floors. However, if you're looking for the perfect sock to sleep in, this is it. Put some lotion on your feet, slip these on, and you will have perfectly smooth feet by morning. I do wear them around the house though because I like how they feel. The only CON is that the seam on the toe is thick and has to be PERFECTLY PLACED, which can be annoying depending on how much time you have getting ready."
4.0,I wear a medium xxl is still tight
4.0,I love the material and the fit.  Does not wrinkle or its great for traveling
4.0,cool though a lil too tight
4.0,I love it.  Wish it was a little but longer (in 5'9&#34;)
4.0,good product but shipment was messy but cool and real. Looks great and the the size is also really good and remember its only one.
4.0,Purchased for my sister to wear with her backless prom dress. If you have a larger busy I would go up a size.
4.0,"Liked color, size, feel.  Very lightweight.  Used on a trip to visit mosques.  Worked well.  Seems like it would not hold up for long but worked for my needs."
4.0,Colors are as pictured. Quality is as expected for the price. Good buy
4.0,"They are way way big, as far as baggy....Very heavy....will be using in the Fall"
4.0,Wears down.
4.0,"small stones, not too big around but will work with my small wrists"
4.0,"Is a good ring for a wedding, I bought both for him and for her, is shiny, has low price, meet my expectations."
4.0,"These are well made and seem comfortable on my toddler. I'm disappointed the boys underwear come in cool dino and truck print and these only come in fruity pastels for girls. I'd buy again, as they're the best thing I've found so far, but if they start offering cooler prints for girls I would buy them for all of the girl children I know."
4.0,"Very cute on my wife but definitly for around the house due to the thinness of the material, they are transparento an extent. Unless, of course, you earn your living one dollar bill at a time in which case these are perfect for outside the he house! Haha. I followed the size guide and they fit my wife perfectly."
4.0,"These are really cute and my daughter was so excited about them.  Unfortunately they were too small - we tried JAMMING her poor little feet in them but they would't get in! I had to return them, but honestly just buy a size larger than expected.  For us, we were already at the largest."
4.0,There super cute but they do fall off my crocs and random times
4.0,Good bag for overnight stay; is well made.  Good carry-on for overhead bin in plane as well as folds easily and flat to put in larger suitcase for future use if needed.
4.0,"Little small, but very comfy!! They are see through but they work great to keep warm under other clothes!!"
4.0,Nice quality and very beautiful. I notice after a week though it's already a little stretched.
4.0,Well they do fit but they give no recommendation for what type glue to use to attache them and superglue wont work
4.0,My 8 year old son is very tall for his age. I bought both the c3 and c2.  He needs the c3 pants but 2c jacket part.  I’m not sure how to contact the seller to see if I can return the c3 jacket only for the c2. He really loves the gi but I’ll have to return the whole thing for a second time if I’m unable to mix and match sizes and hopefully find another brand that fits his tall frame better.
4.0,Material is thin but construction of the dress is solid. Cool dress!
4.0,"The dress fits great on the bottom, but it stuck out on the sides on the top. A lot!  I liked how it look other then that, so I had the sides taken in and fits great now.  So advice is don't buy to fit your bust measurements because it runs big on the bust. I probably could have bought a large instead of and extra large."
4.0,A little small of almost all of my gang........(adults)
4.0,Just what I was looking for.! Perfect mid size rings that don't turn my fingers green or tarnish.
4.0,"Like the material and style very much, but runs very small"
4.0,"Loved the shirt, it’s exactly as expected. Gave it four stars because it took over a month to get here!"
4.0,"Cute top, will order more in different colors. Usually a small in tops and ordered medium, I'm going to try a large as it's a little too short in front for my liking. Hits right at the top of jeans."
4.0,"The little water bottle ear rings are so adorable! They look just like tiny Evian bottles (Although one label was crooked & I couldn't reposition it, which is the reason for 4 stars)! My chronic illness requires me to drink 1 gallon a day so these were a big hit at the hospital."
4.0,Love the design....runs a bit small.
4.0,I like the robe. Feels nice. Seems a little small for the size (s/m)
4.0,"It felt a little light-weight and cheap, but it was cute enough. I'm on the fence if this would be acceptable to give as a gift or not -- if you wanted to risk it, you'd need to provide your own packaging to punch up the appearance of quality."
4.0,"It does the job it's supposed to, its going to be flimsy like any metal this small and light, but do be careful, and its not mean't to be bent, just snapped in place."
4.0,"I got a lighter color, kinda wonder if i should have gone darker. I sometimes wonder if my pants are see through. Seems good, pretty flexible when working out."
4.0,Good quality a little squished when i got it but i tried to prop it up for about a week before i wore it. It was confusing to figure out which way to clip it to have it where i wanted it.
4.0,"I bought these socks for someone else, but had to keep them myself as they would have been too small for a size 8.5 foot.  They fit my size 7 foot snugly.  Perhaps they stretch out more than I think they will over time, but I don't expect them to.  They have a nice weight, not too thin, or too heavy. I'm happy with them."
4.0,"Love the size, compact  yet holds phone with otter box, cards& money. Leather good quality for price, zipper could be of better quality."
4.0,"I find this to be a very well made and practical sling pack for my everyday needs.  The shoulder strap is very well done.  My only regret is that I couldn't order it in ""Black"" as you folks apparently don't offer in that color any more.  If I had it in my favorite color ( black) this would then be the  perfect everyday sling pack for me!"
4.0,No pockets should be included
4.0,"Very good quality, true to size"
4.0,"The shirt is wonderful and I love the material, but even though I went up two sizes as suggested - it was just a touch too tight in the shoulders. Still love it and the color though!"
4.0,Just wish it had to size options  adult / children
4.0,Really cute!  Snug fit but very cute
4.0,Great quality and fit but picture made me think this was all one piece
4.0,These colors don't run..
4.0,"I wasn't sure about this strap, but bought it for an evil panda watch and it went really well! leather was soft and not cheap feeling."
4.0,Loves his lunch box!!
4.0,"This is great, the largest size was just big enough for my rook piercing. However, the end was hard to screw back on once it was in and the color was more of a rose gold than a gold."
4.0,"Cute design and a nice variety but my black one have some extra plastic on it that made it cut into my nose. I was able to fix it a bit with a finger nail clipper and a nail file, but still I have to be careful putting it on and off. They also make your nose sore you you take them off and on a lot throughout the day. Overall, I like the variety."
4.0,Got this for myself. I like the size and quality. Been looking for this for several years and found it here....just the right size
4.0,"Got these for my wife’s 2nd pregnancy cause her very expensive ring got stuck during the first pregnancy and they almost had to cut it off. So didn’t want to take that risk again. She really likes this set, very comfortable. But they break easy during normal everyday activities. 2 of the 3 have broke now. But we didn’t expect them to be bulletproof. So for the price, we wouldn’t hesitate to by again."
4.0,"Love these they are comfy but they do leave the ekg imprinted on your legs after you take them off. I would have gave 5 stars if the ekg threads weren't so imbedingly thick and the price, for $10 bucks It's on the high end all you're paying for is the design."
4.0,I love the quality of these sunglasses - just a little surprised there is a very prominent white outline around the frame. That does not show up very well in the photos.
4.0,Super soft. Fit a tad large but not enough that I can’t use it.
4.0,Product arrived earlier than original date. Wish it came with more packaging. Overall nice and very stylish.
4.0,"Fits good however cut outs are far too large and look a little silly. Also, take tags off before trying it on. The tags as so sharp that it literally put a 2 in long cut in my neck when I was taking the top off"
4.0,"Great quality for the cheap price, the words are hard to read on the womens Rose gold color, the writing on the mens black shows up much better! Otherwise it fits well and doesn’t turn your finger green!"
4.0,The fabric is like a soft shiny silk.. Lace is pretty. A bit too baggy at waist & hips to wear under the popular lightweight long cotton skirts so I have to return. But under loose skirt or dress would be fine.
4.0,Nice qualty for price. Happy
4.0,"It is a nice bracelet. Strong, bit not heavy. Definitely worth it."
4.0,"Got this a while back but yesterday the temps were in single digits with negative 0 F windchills. I made sure to wear one of these when going out and it definitely kept my ears from burning in the fridge temps ... except the bottom of the lobe.<br /><br />The shape and size of my head made it so that in order to cover my earlobe completely the headband had to be lower than my eyebrows, which was a whole other problem. In the end I had about 1/4 of the bottom of my earlobe exposed to the cold. If I had to be out in the cold for a long time that might be a problem, but if that were the case I might have found another adjustment that worked.<br /><br />For the price I'm pretty happy and totally understand that this is a product that is intended to fit my wife or me, and that's a pretty big range of size and shapes to fit."
4.0,Great material but a bit small. Would recommend getting a larger size
4.0,"I bought this sweatshirt because I can’t get the more popular version shipped to where I live.  I haven’t seen the name brand one in person, but this is pretty darn cute.  It’s super soft, cozy, and WARM.  I ordered one size up and it fits great.  It didn’t shrink in the wash.  For this price I will probably also workout in it🤣🤣."
4.0,"I would never have guessed how much pleasure a large assortment of carabiner clips would bring this family! They promptly went into the kitchen ""everything drawer"" where they are handy for just about any use. Some went into camping gear, some went to hang things in the sewing room, a few disappeared into the car.... we haven't used them up yet, but when we do, I shall certainly order more!"
4.0,"Came with the handle broken but the seller quickly replied and arranged a replacement. Umbrella is a little cheap but I expected this. Overall good for the price and ships fast, I use this as a cosplay prop for klaus from umbrella academy."
4.0,They are very cute and nice material. Wish they had a wire piece for the nose so they were more protective.
4.0,it was really small. Smaller than I expected. But I love it!!!!
4.0,I baught this because its 31 in long with a big opening size.great to travel because of the shorter length.its made well i can not stand fold up umbrellas like the handle and it has a fiberglass shaft
4.0,"I ordered this because of the high waist.  I'm not a bikini wearer because of a couple of surgeries I've had and because my lower belly isn't in the shape I feel is needed for a bikini.  I'm sort of old fashioned - I feel that you really need the right body to wear one that is cut low.  I wear a size 14 pants and after reading the reviews, ordered the XL.  The bottom fit great!  But I'm only a 36B on top and the top was too big in the cup size (it fit OK around).  I wound up giving it to my teen daughter who also wears a size 14 but her chest is a 34D and both pieces fit her fine.  If you're small on top and bigger on the bottom like me, this suit isn't going to fit you well.  It's too bad they didn't sell the pieces separately for proper sizing.  But if you're like my daughter and have enough on top and are curvy on the bottom, this will fit you just fine.  Even though this suit is inexpensive, it really looks like a pricey suit that you'd find in a fine department store."
4.0,"These are peachy/pink with black spots. If you’re not into bright, I wouldn’t recommend. I thought they’d be a neutral tans"
4.0,"A good sized bag and love the feel of the fake leather.  My only complaint is that the snap in/out inner pouch snaps out a bit too easily, even when just putting something into or taking something out of it."
4.0,The warm socks are amazing and does the job right.  I am quite satisfied.
4.0,"Fits okay, wouldn’t say great, but it is a cute dress for the price. On the bigger side."
4.0,It was definitely impressive.
4.0,"Adorable, my son loves them!"
4.0,Simple face covering. Ordered these to make team face masks for a softball team.
4.0,"Had a pink band on original purchase, but regarding durability, one of the band that held the wrist band came off. The end of the band was sticking out, making it in the way and looked tacky. Being somewhat frugal, attempted to use a twist tie to keep it down, but still looked tacky. Ended up cutting the band down with scissors.  Finally, the band by the pins/where you attach new one/or different colored band, had a slit in it, and thus, couldn't wear my watch. Ended up purchasing a new wrist band...<br />Watch is comfortable, easy to read, including second hand. I like the fact that the band, when it gets wet, over time, doesn't have that yucky smell to it, like a leather band gets. Easy to keep clean.<br />One other thing, I wish it had the glow feature, especially when trying to see what time it is in the dark or nighttime."
4.0,While the coat did not fit me the seller stepped up to the plate and refunded my purchase.  Not many sellers would do this.  I would buy from these people again.
4.0,"Really cute, a little different on the material kind of feels a little like soft gauze but is cute and not rough or scratchy feeling! A little wide on the neck"
4.0,Bit pricey but had to have it to match the Jim Root squire guitar
4.0,Thanks they work great.
4.0,"Love this shirt.  Runs big.  I will be altering as I love the color, style and texture."
4.0,These glasses help with night driving. They genuinely cut the glare. They fit easily over my prescription lenses and are comfortable on. They are lightweight. They come with a cloth carrying pouch and cleaning cloth.
4.0,The perfect white flip flop and great for the price!
4.0,"This was a birthday gift for my dear friend. She has very petite, delicate features and a small face. None of the other masks would fit securely around her nose and mouth without huge gaps. This purchase, however, fit perfectly! Comfortable behind the ears and secure across the face, she absolutely loved this mask and scarf combo. I was very pleased!"
4.0,Beautiful dress.. Great Quality for the price ur paying!! Unfortunately I had to return it because it fit big!
4.0,purchased these for a fun night with my friend we both loved them
4.0,Very nice print and fitting is perfect. Only thing is the waist just have an elastic band and doesn’t seem like will last long. But very nice print and fabric for the price
4.0,Fits most used once K-cups
4.0,Comfortable but wish they sold petite tops to match petite pants too as it is a little long for a 4' 11&#34; statue!
4.0,Better value and.nicer than chucks plus cool color
4.0,Super cute! Myhickens got them off somehow and they got buried in their run. They were cute while they lasted. The other chickens freaked out about them while on the other chickens at first. Like they were scared of the chickens that were wearing them.
4.0,"I really liked the dress, however, I am considering returning it because it is too long and there are two holes in the fabric about two inches above the hem line."
4.0,"These are so cute -- they look amazing and are great conversation starters. I have the game set. They are a little tight and I wish they would stretch a little more. If they did, I'd give them 5 stars. They are comfortable enough but I can't say they're extremely comfortable for those of us who like our socks to be a little stretchier."
4.0,"This would be five stars as all of the other ones I have purchased were great, however, just this particular pair I received had an error. It looked like the machine goofed and there was a about a 4 inch spot along the seam of the inner leg where it didn't get sewed shut. I loved them, so rather than send them back and wait for another pair, I just fixed them myself and they've been good to go."
4.0,If I have ot back on my ears the black part hurts my ears after I take it off so I try to let that part be loose on my head then my ears dont hurt
4.0,The zipper is too short.  Otherwise a great comfortable short.
4.0,Awesome set for the price. Some feel and look more like acrylic fakes than actual stone. Got one pair with a chip but still wearable.
4.0,I do like the fabric and the style. also the fact that it does not need ironing.<br />I would have liked a longer edition
4.0,They actually do what they say they will do they are polarized a little bit but more than other brands it does help with night driving
4.0,"The best part of this dress is the way it feels. The beading is perfect and swings heavily and the fringe is plenty thick. It appears quite well made, especially considering the sort of stuff available online these days; for instance the pattern is exactly as shown and perfectly done. The only real problem is that the fit is deliberately very loose and almost like a t-shirt so it's not actually flattering. It's fun to wear and stunning by way of glitter and a very well-executed pattern but not really flattering. The underslip also stops quite a bit short of the actual hem and since the dress itself is transparent, it shows. The zipper was a little fussy to get on the first time so it's possible it won't last a hugely long time but for all these flaws it's still gorgeous to look at and feels great on. For reference, I am 150 lbs, 5' 8&#34; and ordered a large because my waist is 31&#34; but since my bust is 36D, it fits quite loosely. I'd still recommend it I think, especially for holiday wear, especially a New Year's party."
4.0,These are nice earrings  however I thought they would be a little bigger. So far they haven't faded but I've only worn them a couple of times.
4.0,Pretty but very flimsy. You get what you pay for. Cheap China-made product that I can tell won't last long. But I'll enjoy it while it holds up.
4.0,"I love this dress. It works with or without a belt, it hides my postpartum areas while still making me feel pretty and feminine, and it has the perfect scoop neck so I may still BF. However, I gave 4 stars because after only a couple washings it has thinned the material enough to become transparent. Perhaps hand wash and do not put in dryer."
4.0,"Good quality bathing suit, however I went by the reviews to choose a size and it ended up being too big. I'm usually between an small and medium and ordering a large was a mistake."
4.0,Not adult sized. This would fit a kids ankle.
4.0,"Smaller than you think, but still a solid purchase."
4.0,I am normally between a lg and an xl. I ordered the xl.. it fits but Is a bit tight. Wish i would have ordered at xxl. Outer fabric is very stiff until after the first wash.
4.0,"He said they were comfortable, I just didn't get them<br />Large enough I guess."
4.0,"Gorgeous fit , I ordered 2 sizes up and totally love it except I ordered a black and got a navy blue..."
4.0,"I bought this dress last minute for an event I'm going to this weekend. I was a little nervous, having read the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised when it came in. The dress looks exactly like the picture! My only complaint is that it's a tad bit loose around the bust and waist area, but that's my bad for getting my exact size. Size down if you want a more accurate fit."
4.0,"I got this for a costume piece and while it worked well enough, sadly the image they show (green jacket with black zippers) was in actuality all green, no black (which I really needed for my costume). Oh well, it worked in a pinch and fit as expected though."
4.0,I got these for my daughter and she loved them. They are cute.
4.0,"I'm 5'9 and 130lbs, and pretty small framed. I bought the smallest dress they had and it's a little big at my waist and boobs, but that's normal for me. Perfect length though; right at the knee.<br />The straps will definitely have to be reinforced with a couple extra stitches, but for the money it's an all around good dress. Good material. Pretty colors."
4.0,"Tried it on. Ordered my typical size. Very pretty color. The sleeves were a bit tight and the body of the shirt were a bit loose. Made in and shipped from China, so takes a long time to be delivered."
4.0,"This blouse it cute, but I would recommend ordering the actual size that you normally order. I'm usually a medium and ordered a large due to the &#34;Asian&#34; sizing and I look lost in it. I think a smaller size would be a better fit. It will work under a jacket/blazer.  The material is sheer, light and comfortable."
4.0,These aren’t the most stylish or best material. That said hubby had major surgery that left one foot with permanent swelling and most shoes are impossible to wear. These allow him to slide them on and are a step up from athletic wear when he needs a nicer look for church or dressier occasions. He does not use the inserts.
4.0,"Very pretty, but had to rate 4 stars because it is very hard to get open to get out of your nose. Wish I would have known that before I ordered it."
4.0,I love the outfit but the pants were a bit too small for the extra extra large that was ordered And some of the threads are starting to come loose but it is a nice outfit
4.0,"The yoga sports bra are worth the price. They’re comfy, stretchy, and breathable. It was so comfy that I wore it all day. The pad inside the bra had to be adjusted once or twice through the whole 13 hour day. This bra is indeed for yoga, an outdoor walk, or going to the store, but not a sports bra. Perhaps if it was more snug would be fine to run in, but I wouldn’t recommend it. I brought a large size since I have broad shoulders and was worried the fabric might shrink after reading previous reviews, I could have gone either way. Most likely be buying another set just to have and another set to give to my daughter."
4.0,"Beautiful as the picture, I must say I was happy when I opened the it."
4.0,Some of them are a little too long for my ear and ends up poking me in the side of the face. Also they don't like to stay put and I almost lost one the first time I wore it for the fact it kept sliding down the top of my ear.
4.0,I attached this to an overcoat and it looks fabulous!
4.0,Love the shirt!<br />1 1/2 months shipping
4.0,IT WAS TOO LOOSE IN THE BUST AREA OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE IT
4.0,These were super cute for my daughter but they were a little on the bigger side. She wears size 11 and this fit like a 12. Maybe size down when purchasing these.
4.0,"Love the watch,  the jewelry on it changes its tone of color. Great design"
4.0,I love the dress. It did have a hole in the pocket area.
4.0,"The shirt is good, it fits well and it has good material. Perfect for hot days."
4.0,1) There should be a &#34;small&#34; version of this glove.<br />2) The &#34;medium&#34; is on the large size.<br />It's still a very good product.
4.0,"Overall a very nice looking watch. I wanted an everyday work watch that I was not too concerned about damage.  It's easy to read it's large but not too large watch face and very lightweight. The wrist band is adjusted easily but looks like it might not last long-""time"" will tell.  Four stars because I have only had it for 4 weeks and I can't predict how long it may work based on its base price."
4.0,"Really love the design, this is actually a nylon material not cotton which I didn’t know but still like it! I am a medium-got a large and it fit but a little tight right across the chest for me"
4.0,"Love it, so far. Hope it doesn't change colors."
4.0,"I love socks like some women love shoes. So, I own many pairs. These socks fit exactly as described (one size for my size - which is 7). They have a small compression area and a ridged top and are rather thin. They wick moisture as described in the product information. The best thing about these socks is that they are lightweight, but that's also the worst thing about them. Because they are so thin, the compression part is not that noticeable.<br /><br />In summary, these cute athletic socks are, as described in the product information, moisture wicking and fit size 7-ish feet. Because they are thin, they are great for summer wear but don't squeeze my foot as much as I'd like."
4.0,"This mask (pink with rhinestones) is really pretty, good quality, not at all flimsy, fits well and the filter is substantial. My daughter saw them (I ordered 2) and wanted one, she’s 21. I will order more colors since we have to wear them."
4.0,I suppose they are what they are suport to be... I just apparently don't like latex socks.  I was still happy to experiment.  Hehehe...
4.0,Very nice item by Guess.
4.0,Too long. It was extremely long. I can't wear heels so that was out.
4.0,Cute but not very tight compression and stringy after a few washes on inside of socks and my toes get caught
4.0,"a little glossy, but its really nice quality and I love the mouth piece so you don't have to bite the round part."
4.0,"The Selene Women's Round Neck Pajama Dress is a cool and comfortable item to sleep in. It is also easy to wash. I like the almost baseball t-shirt design with the floral graphic. The garment is simple, pretty and comfortable."
4.0,"Love it but a little smaller than expected, couldn't tell it was hands for leaves."
4.0,"The watch is exactly as described, and very useful for the price it is. It should be noted however that the watch is fairly big."
4.0,"This Christmas watch band was just ok.  The band is cute, but it is in such a way that it goes under instead of having a buckle for the band itself.  It was very uncomfortable."
4.0,The glasses are fine about what I expected
4.0,Looked great on me! Thank you.
4.0,Does the trick for someone wanting a little more coverage.
4.0,This came exactly like the lv monogram embossed lettering in black pattern they have. It matched perfectly with my pochette I have that was purchased from Dhgate lol. This is just easier because it literaly comes in 2 days if you have prime. However it was just too small the wrist area. I saw someone able to buy the pink pattern on Amazon as well which was amazing quality but it sold out. Maybe if it re stocks I will buy the pink one as it’s wrist length was a lot longer than the black. I’m not sure if posting a picture would make this post go down so I won’t but it looks exactly alike. It also come in a blacked out pouch as it would come in from Dhgate since it’s illegal to sell dupes… returning
4.0,Inexpensive necklace but looks nice
4.0,"Cute tunic shirt dress, but description is misleading. Mine arrived but had no side pockets as advertised. It does have a pocket on the front top area. The fabric is lightweight and breathable, but see through and thin. It’s also very short. I will be layering it over a tank and bottom or use it as a sleep shirt. The front buttons are functional.  For reference I got a size large."
4.0,"I will be returning this item.<br />There's nothing wrong with it, but it's just not what I was expecting.<br />The pendant itself is pretty and the color is fine too, but the color was just painted on the back. I was expecting the design to be inside the pendant. I bought another pendant along with this one from Chuvora and was equally as disappointed.<br />It's absolutely not worth the price I paid."
4.0,Lovely earrings.  Smaller than I expected but you can't have them back!
4.0,Bigger that I expected and a little on the flimsy side but my daughter loves it
4.0,Nice shirt. Love the color. I got it in wine red. It fit well. It's true to size. The only thing that's not perfect is the cut out strips on the sleeves. They are a little thin and not hemmed so I'm not sure how well it will hold up long term. But it's a good price and a nice top for a night out.
4.0,"They’re as advertised, but they don’t fit my face.  The nose grip hurts my nose, the arms are to tight on my head.  Not very comfortable for more than a short period of time.  Not sure why they’re designed to go over glasses when the magnifying lense should be serving that purpose. Also, magnifying lens doesn’t quite line up with my eyes."
4.0,It pinches a little....tri-tone flattering to skin tone...
4.0,"These fit okay just a bit large after wearing awhile (they do stretch a little.) I am 5'5"" and these are a good length for me.  I would give them a try."
4.0,"Little tight but, he loved It"
4.0,"good socks, a little tight"
4.0,"These are very nice for regular lap swimming. The case is a nice touch, but the feature I really appreciate most is that they are shaded like sunglasses."
4.0,Pretty dress that fits true to size. Only complaint is that both pockets have a hole in them.
4.0,These are a great value
4.0,It's big and warm. It's also gorgeous. Only downside is that I have already snagged it a couple of times.
4.0,"It is a beautiful sparkling dress. It fits a little small and things can catch quite easy to the fabric. Other than that, it is lovely. I had to close the leg opening because it goes too high."
4.0,"Really like it. Simple, yet classy. Nice shine and quality. I have had nothing but good experiences shopping for jewelry on Amazon. ( let's keep it that way) lol..."
4.0,"These are good, non-glare and the side bars do not catch your hair."
4.0,"Nice design, but thin material."
4.0,A little stiff & heavy but classy
4.0,It's what you expect for what you pay for the silver doesn't take long to start to rub off.
4.0,"This dress is so soft! The fit was a little bigger than I had anticipated, but not so big that it's uncomfortable. I'm 5'3 and the hem landed just around my knees. It'll be great to wear in the summer with sandals and with boots and leggings in the fall/winter. I'll definitely be buying more in other colors."
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for..I am just anxious to see how well the bottom stays on because the construction appears as if it might not be attached very well..although I have had no problems thus far
4.0,"I love these earings, they are beautiful"
4.0,"Looks a bit different from photo, otherwise a nice product for the price you pay."
4.0,"I love this bag. It is big enough to fit papers and a notebook or two for work along with my lunch, gloves, wallet, etc. but still feels like a purse. The material is perfect because it doesn't look plasticky but won't get destroyed like leather. I do wish it had another pocket or two. Inside there is only one small zipper pocket. When mine arrived I was a little skeptical about the clasp on the shoulder strap. Sure enough, it broke less than five minutes into my walking commute. Thankfully, I contacted the seller and received a replacement strap. The clasp is a little different and has been great so far."
4.0,"Good, standard leggings. I expected them to be a little softer."
4.0,"This dress is super comfortable.  I wore it to the office with a Jacket.  After the office the Jacket comes off for a dinner and i looked great.  I have a lot of expensive dresses and however, did not feel uncomfortable in this one at all.  The material gives and it does not look inexpensive.  Perfect fit."
4.0,"Was a little lower quality than I was expecting, but still pretty decent. It is a Christmas present for my daughter, and I am sure she'll love it"
4.0,I’m so glad I read all other reviews to size up! I usually wear a medium in shirts but in this one I ordered a large and it fits perfect.
4.0,"I just got this shirt delivered today. I ordered an XL in black. I normally wear size L..I was kind of on the fence about what size to order after reading the reviews. It fits, but a Large would have been perfect.. I love this shirt!! I loved it so much, I just ordered the blue, but in a Large. I would totally recommend buying this with total confidence!!  If this has helped you, please check the box below.. Thanks"
4.0,Nice comfort shirts
4.0,"It was a gift for my husband. He was a little disappointed they were not printed on both sides, but he likes them. Washed them warm with like colors-they turned out nicely 0 if any shrinkage, kept colors as well. Overall a good product; so nice to find a large size for a reasonable price. Thank You."
4.0,"The light could be better and the strap sometimes makes a squeaky noise, but overall worth the price."
4.0,I purchased this purse not through Amazon but from Lucky Brand itself and I love it! The color of mine is lighter than what is showed in the picture but over all it is a great product! It has plenty of space and compartments and have used it when traveling!
4.0,The rings are so cute and have been threw the ringer with my girls. The earrings are really small and made an allergic reaction to my dauhters ears. Highly reccommend the rings.
4.0,use it playing cricket and out door hiking. light and easy to use.
4.0,The gold fades after a while with use but I still love it
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c2a8cd5adfa1b175fa4705f277d6a7fc]] It’s so beautiful. The only thing i didn’t like was that they put black on the edges of the picture instead of Gold like in the back! And also, shipping took a bit long. But other than that, it’s beautiful!"
4.0,"I bought two nightgowns and the first one was great! This one, not as much. It is a different style and shipped<br />from a different location. The tag on the back was weird and when I snipped the care directions out, there<br />was a piece of plastic embedded inside fabric. The brand tag was 'glued' to the fabric. It wasn't sewn.<br />I am weird but that situation caused a welt that bothered me all night. I snipped the fabric to not only get<br />the plastic thing out but to remove the tag. Yes. there are now two tiny holes in the back. Hopefully, after<br />more washings it doesn't get bigger. Overall, the fabric is soft and fits fine. I just wouldn't use glue or whatever to attach tags."
4.0,Good lettering and delivery but uncomfortable to wear
4.0,"The sizing is okay for my notebook, my only problem is that the first and last letters are cut off making it read &#34;ARILYN MANSO&#34; but, it's funny at least"
4.0,"Fits well, fits as expected. Nothing completely stops the bounce."
4.0,I could have gone for a smaller size.....
4.0,"It arrived on time and well-packaged against rough handling during shipping. I wore it yesterday with two pairs of butterfly earrings and I just had a big smile on my face all day, I felt so cute and pretty. My middle name means ‘butterfly’ so this was a special birthday gift."
4.0,"As far as the quality goes- it is as expected. None of mine had loose thread or tearing. My only complaint is that the green I orders is much darker than the photo, it's almost a forest green. So be warned that the color isn't quite as cutesy and pastel like the images, but overall I am pleased with the product."
4.0,Come up to high between crotch and waist too big and baggy therr returned them
4.0,"When i first opened the package, my first thought was how cheap looking they were. But once i tried them on, they actually looked quite nice, especially with a tunic top.  The fabric is rather slippery and wants to ride down on me as i walk. But its not too bad. Not bad for the price."
4.0,Not the most handy but really cute
4.0,I love it. Fits perfectly. Will be buying other colors.
4.0,It's a cute bathing suit don't get me wrong it was a little too big that I had to tie it in the back. Besides that I still happy with the purchase
4.0,"Shoe is very cute and well made, but the come with tissue paper and tape covering the rhinestones on the straps. Thankfully none pulled out but it took some work to GENTLY get the paper and tape off without ruining the shoe."
4.0,"Overall quite comfortable, but the stitched seams do irritate a bit. I expect that to get better with wear."
4.0,"It's a nice hat, but I'm surprised that it was too small for my head.  I don't have a large head (that I know of), so I would rate this hat as nice, with good quality, but a bit on the small side.  After returning it,  I went to a couple local retail stores (including grocery) and every hat I tried on fit fine, so I bought three.  That tells me I don't have a huge head, but rather this hat runs small."
4.0,"It is very nice. The hat was sent in a soft package and arrived wrinkled, but that was easily remedied."
4.0,My children loved the vibrant prints and friendly scenes! Only minor concern is the size of these masks. Overall better fit for school aged kids and may be difficult to keep on toddler/preschool faces
4.0,"It is cute but very small, hardly noticeable. If you are looking for something small but still cute, this is it. If you are looking for something noticeable, this is not it only because of the size."
4.0,I ordered a small and it fit very well.
4.0,I was a little disappointed.  It is very cute - but it also looks very cheap- the picture makes the item look a little high quality than it is.  It is what it is and I am going to enjoy it
4.0,I wear these at least 3 times a week. I need them in every color. Very lightweight! Wish they came in shorter length as well but still LOVE!
4.0,Very pretty. Very petite.
4.0,I really like this shirt and the fit is true to size.  The only thing I have noticed is now that I have worn and washed it several times the fabric is starting to ball up a little in a few areas.  It is not that noticeable but for the price it has been great.
4.0,I was worried as I have a smaller head but this hat is perfect.  Nice and snug.
4.0,"This wasn't what I expected, but that's not entirely a bad thing. The picture shows one chain, and instead there were three. It is a nice conversation piece, but it's not comfortable enough for daily or long time use. I just received it yesterday, so I can't speak for its durability, but it was delivered very quickly and on time. I took off a star since the picture didn't match what I received."
4.0,"Very soft as described.  I'm 5'9"" 155lbs . And the small fit fine but I'm a lean 155. Color is nice and fabric is great. My only comment is if your a serious runner or health nut the soft fabric cant hold too much sweat.  Sweat dripping off me after my 6 mile run. But nice for workouts at the gym or running around town"
4.0,Should have bought them a size smaller.
4.0,Love the look of it. It runs well even after its been wet though it does not claim to be waterproof.
4.0,Cute shirt for the price and I may order another in different color.
4.0,"I loved the earring cuff.I thought it was a little bit smaller than shown.I still wear it ,i love it"
4.0,So far so good. The hook is a little tight to work.
4.0,"Cute shirt! But these are sized kinda different...I should have ordered one size down from my usual size. Otherwise, super cute!"
4.0,The color is a little brighter than I expected.It's not the look I was going for so I returned. I do think it would make a cute beach cover up.
4.0,"Item came will all pieces described.  Pay attention to the size, I mistakenly ordered a 2XL (thinking it would run small.)<br />Suit more appropriate for a Star Wars Jedi &#34;knight&#34; theme party, vs the Renaissance theme party.<br />Quality of the materials was good for the price."
4.0,Nice lightweight Camo Pants.
4.0,"Very comfortable as long as expected, I'm 5ft and it's below my waist, a little loose on the breasts, but I don't mind, I ordered a large"
4.0,These bras are really cute and seem to be made well. I ordered the size suggested and it fits okay but I definitely wouldn’t say it’s good for high impact workouts.
4.0,This isn't top of the line.  It's a basic black wallet.  It's not a soft material.. it's a little tough until it's used a little. If your looking for a soft wallet keep looking.  It is a good basic wallet though.
4.0,I really like the light material and the way it fits. The red bean color is more of a dark coral then red. Looking to purchase another one in blue.
4.0,Got this one for chilly nights at sea on the lido deck
4.0,I'm glad I read the reviews and sized up. I'm usually a medium but bought an XL. It fits me the way normal M shirts would.
4.0,"A very nice costume for the price!<br />I love to just lounge around the house in it, but probably wouldn't wear it outside my home.<br />It's very see-thru so I have to wear a plain white shirt underneath and it makes it look bulky.<br />Also,<br />The inner velcro part above the bow is awkward, kind of itchy and it seems crooked when I velcro it in.<br />And the bow is pretty droopy considering it has to be safety pinned on.<br />Plus, be sure to order a larger size than what you might think!<br />I am on the small/medium side with average hips/breasts and the large fits me the best.<br />But all in all,<br />My wallet is happy, and so am I~"
4.0,"I took it on a 2 week trip and used it almost every day for carrying snacks, cameras, etc - it was extremely easy to travel with, very lightweight, has multiple pockets and water bottle holders. for the price, it was a great value and I plan to use it often. It has no padding so not really good for a laptop but it worked OK for my camera with a little clothing inside as protection."
4.0,"I bought a medium, and it fits, but it is a little small.  Warm though, so it's perfect for what I bought it for.  Just worried when I wash it it will shrink."
4.0,"They sent this dress in the wrong style. The style I received is very tight around the groin area, so will have to send back for larger size. Fits perfectly everywhere else! I'm normally a 2/4."
4.0,the plastic part of the sandals are very rigid and one side rubs my big toe when i walk…had to stop wearing because i was getting a blister.  i think they’ll be more comfortable after they get worn in.  other than that they’re great.
4.0,My boyfriend is a big fan of lebron he absolutely loved them
4.0,These are really cute earrings! They are a little larger than I anticipated but they're still adorable.
4.0,"Love the fit, just the right size. Not flopping around on my head."
4.0,It's a great quality! I love it! The only issue I have with it is it has a bad odor smell to it.
4.0,"Beautiful glasses- really beautiful!!!! Great price, they were packaged beautifully- no complaints about that but I do agree with the other reviewer they are heavy and sharp edged on the arms. The right arm kept cutting into my ear... I will have to figure out some type of cushion to put there. I don't want to give them up."
4.0,"For the money not a bad hat it looks good, feels good. Time will tell if it holds up."
4.0,Great product- glass rather than plastic and very easy to fill. Looks good too!
4.0,"The dress itself fits properly, but know that it is SHORT, ladies."
4.0,Kind of large to me.
4.0,"Bought larger than needed and fit like it should, more of a longer cami than slip"
4.0,Wore it to a last minute funeral fits as expected but I wasn’t too impressed with material but it’s still very flattering
4.0,Nice quality not great for price but ....
4.0,fun Halloween workout costume
4.0,It's a gift for my niece.
4.0,Socks fit well. Good non slip. I use mine for Pilates class. Wash up welll. They are much thinner than my other toe socks but that is great for the summer.
4.0,"This is a decent stocking cap for chilly days and has  a unique combination of headphones and headlamp. I see this being useful for runners and people who like to enjoy being out doors. For about $20 it's not a bad deal. Regular stocking caps cost anywhere from $14 to $24, so this isn't too bad. Only thing is that it's not made for extreme cold Temps. This cap is for chilly weather 40° mid 30° not for super freezing weather. If I got this cap as a present of gift, I'd be very happy with it."
4.0,It was for my daughter she loved it.
4.0,"Cute, a little couch-y floral, needed a cardigan to break it up."
4.0,"Fits just right , comfy , not major issues, however the sleeve was not completely sewn together on the cuff portion. Didnt even notice until on the way home from work after wearing it all day . but love it"
4.0,Got this for a memorial for my son and the engraving came out great.
4.0,Beautiful piece. Functioned well and kept time. Band and band attachment rod were terrible quality. That component broke so many times when simply sliding off a backpack or purse strap. (Never happens with my other watches.) Eventually stopped taking it in to have the band reattached and it just sits around.
4.0,Dress is a mini dress - fine for wearing in a very casual atmosphere such as the beach (though material is heavier than I’d prefer for beach wear).  Oversized fit so if you are plus sized this is a nice fitting dress. It’s just short. You cannot wear in a professional work environment. You could wear as a tunic top over leggings and boots.
4.0,"As described, yet I didn't get the colors in the picture. I didn't get two different yellows and the purple was darker than a lavender as pictured. Otherwise, they work for a hair accessory or around my neck."
4.0,"These are truly wonderful. Would've given 5 stars but, because I've got about 20lbs of Rocky Road ice cream on me at the time, the top is just a wee bit small & this causes the hose to pull down. Couldn't get a larger size cause I wouldn't have had the terrific tight fit on my calves; which I need post knee replacement surgery."
4.0,Too small for my 9 year old.  It may work best for kids 3-7.<br />The style works well for when a mask can be removed and needed again.  Don’t have to worry about collecting from kids and keep track of them as they keep them around their neck.
4.0,"Earrings are nice, a little concerned they might tarnish."
4.0,Was relieved that it wasn’t made smaller than usual US sizes.  Well made.  Looks like image .  Love pockets!
4.0,Love the colors! Bows are hot glued to cap. Caps are too big for my newborn but adjustments can be made (tuck the cap or insert a stitch to fit). Washed caps in cold water and tumble dried on low heat. All bows with the exception of 1 came untied in the wash. I retied them and added a couple of stitches to ensure they'd stay tied.
4.0,Great looking sandal.  Very pretty.
4.0,They all came in their own little bags. They’re cute tho
4.0,Love this watch!  It is so cute and stylish!
4.0,I like them but the lens is a little too dark.
4.0,Lovely and fits well and a bargain.
4.0,"Beautiful bag in tan leather that completely holds its shape. It's one big opening, with two interior slip pockets and one zippered.  The zipper is high quality and came with the leather pull wrapped.  The entire bag was shipped in a disposable plastic bag and filled with stuffing to the top to protect the shape.  Metal fitting at the top to hold the bag in rectangular shape once filled was also wrapped. Original tags were on it with MSRP price,  buttons are labeled with Frye, and unlike another review,  this one came with the metal feet as pictured.  I do believe this is an authentic Frye bag.  It smells like real leather and is soft to the touch.  I think this one was able to be discounted to half its price because it has two visible scratches that either were repaired or not too terrible. If I were in a store paying full price,  I'd pass. However,  given the price,  it's a keeper. The seller may not have been aware of the imperfections. Frye labeling is throughout. From a bag design perspective,  the lack of interior structure is ok,  but I wouldn't pay the original price for an otherwise easy bag to construct.  The straps are also pretty thin and if loaded to capacity, will dig into my shoulder.  I also see some buckling at the bottom that may turn into a deep crease, but that may be avoided once there is something in it. I've taken one star off for the scratches and interior design.  Great find though because I see the five available when I ordered are gone and now there is another seller at full price, plus shipping."
4.0,Can't go wrong with this ring!
4.0,"I like the glasses. The case has a slight defect that makes it difficult to insert the glasses. It is not a problem when you pull the inner liner, of the bottom part of the case, up with a finger, before inserting the glasses."
4.0,"Nice hoodie, a bit on the larger size. Would have been great if it fit."
4.0,For the price of the 3pk you could do a lot worse than these.  They are very thin material but again it should minimize sweating when you get hot.  They are very form fitting and are really only useful for working out or yard activity - I wouldn’t wear in public even though it does show off the assets well.  These seem to be made intentionally small for reasonably fit guys so order accordingly.
4.0,"This is a great watch for the price.  Came ticking out of the package.  For the first few hours after setting it, I wasn't sure if it was staying accurate, but it's been dead on time ever since.  Also, I've only set the time once, I saw a lot of reviews about having to reset every morning, well not the case with mine, I just give it a few windings a couple times a day, in the morning, and before bed.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because today it seemed to develop a condensation on the inside of the glass.  I wash my hands a lot working in a restaurant, and being mindful not to get it wet because it's not waterproof, but, I put a blow dryer on it for a minute and cleared it out, perfecto. Also why not a 5 star, is some of the finish on the band is slightly wearing away already, but it still looks great."
4.0,Perfect size to limit the amount of &#34;clutter&#34; you carry around
4.0,"Two nice bands for my wife.  Not exactly what she wanted, but she couldn't find metal band."
4.0,Wasn't quite as flowy/oversized as expected
4.0,O coment
4.0,I was able to easily adjust it to fit my arm.
4.0,"The hat is really the gem of the set. It's warm, but breathable, and the flaps have a weighted object in them that keeps them down over your ears. Whatever is inside the flaps is bendable, so be careful not to bunch the hat up, or you'll have to work the flap back into shape. The gloves are fine, but a little thinner than expected. They'd work well as driving gloves, or for light activities in the Fall or maybe a short walk in the Winter. But I doubt I'll use these for shoveling or sledding or any extended outdoor activities. I'll also add, the gloves came in one size (XL), which fit me just fine (5'9"" adult male), but the description should really do a better job of explaining the sizing for them. Then again, they do picture an adult male using them, so maybe that's fine. I didn't have any luck with the fingertip working on my phone, but I've never had any luck with gloves that claim they'll allow me to use my iPhone with my gloves on--so it's probably user error."
4.0,"Good, my grand daughter liked it."
4.0,Very well made but unfortunatley are a kid size - not for adults.
4.0,Color better than appears; a more brick colored red than bright red which I prefer; nice stretch and fit with flattering neckline.
4.0,"This was pretty decent quality, however, the dress was at least a size too large for me. Measurements for me are approximately 32x24-25x33-34. It was loose everywhere and came mid-calf (I’m 5’1”, so that’s expected).  They just need at least a size smaller available to fit anyone who is a 00-2."
4.0,"Good shower shoes, as they are all rubber. Size 11 fit as expected. They are stiff and may break if forced into luggage."
4.0,Love the colors and fit perfectly for me.
4.0,I am 5'7 about 200lbs and i bought i sz 1x and they fit good! They do strech which is nice but after reading reviews i thought they woukd be much stretchier bit i thought they were nice! The 1 thing is that they are long (and im 5'7) they kind of bunched at my ankles which i dont mind i think it looks good!
4.0,It was missing a couple duplicates but they did look nice and snap on well
4.0,This is a very cute outfit. I gave as a gift and her parents loved the camo touch. It is fairly well made.
4.0,"The Panda hat is cute.  The sizing is a little tight for an adult, it is a good size for kids."
4.0,"The price is low, the crucifix is wieldy. Perhaps it should operate for a necklace that is slightly weightier and more expensive while offering its jump-on price."
4.0,"Order two sizes larger than normal, XL fits my 32&#34; waist.  these fit very well once you get past the size issue.  I use them for my daily walk and they never feel too loose or too tight.  The elastic band is wide, which helps these stay in place. Adequate sized pockets fit a 5&#34; cell phone. Medium weight fabric, comfortable on cold mornings."
4.0,Sizing is smaller than what is expected
4.0,I didn't enjoy the ginger flavor but the others were good.
4.0,Cuter than I'd hoped for...super cheap and a good  way to be trendy without spending a lot of bucks.
4.0,"I like these, but the soul of the shoe is wearing out after a few months."
4.0,Was way to big for my husband!
4.0,My child loves it came a little bit bigger than I expected but she'll grow into it
4.0,"I purchased the red dress in a medium. The color and print are lovely! I like how breathable the fabric is.  It also is great for nursing. However after the first wash on cold and line drying,  the dress shrunk an entire size, causing gaps with a few buttons. (It was originally a little big) For reference I am 5'6 and 135 pounds. I'm including a picture post wash."
4.0,I use it but from time to time it is a little hard to sue depending on the size of the bracket clasp.
4.0,"I bought the L size. It was a little tighter around the arms and neck than other HD clothes I've previously bought. Given that it is &#34;performance&#34; type clothing, I expected the fit to be a little closer rather than loose. However, the cut around the neck can get uncomfortable. Other than that, I do like the shirt. It looks great and I also like the reflective print. I would wish that there was some reflective lining on the back as well so that drivers could see the rider from the back as well."
4.0,"They are fun to wear but a real ""Kelly green,"" a little brighter than I had expected."
4.0,I do like that I was able to get alot of them for a low price but I do wish they had a better range of colors and maybe some elastic for those of us with smaller heads.  All in all I think that they are a great value and will meet my needs.
4.0,"The immediate thing that stood out to me about this item was the attention to detail in its construction. I've watched Arrow many times and can say with confidence that the makers of this costume have faithfully replicated every aspect of Oliver's costume down to the tiniest, most minute detail.<br />I did have a small issue with the fit- the pants ended up being about 2 inches too big around my waist- but I'd expected that given that this is sized in men's sizing and I'm not a man, and it's an issue easily compensated for by wearing a belt, so it doesn't bother me too much.<br />I'm rating it four stars instead of five only because one of the gloves had a small hole in it when I received it, but I was able to mend it very easily, so I wouldn't let that deter you from purchasing this item if you were considering it.<br />Overall, I recommend this. I can't wait to wear it out when we have cons again!"
4.0,"Great price, fast delivery, everything as advertised, size true."
4.0,"its good quality and the colors are true to the image, i just wish it looked more like the real thing."
4.0,too short for  credit cards/business cards
4.0,It is gorgeous and my little princess is stunning in this dress!  Super pleased!
4.0,Its a really pretty bracelet
4.0,"Very cute, but arrived with side seam completely undone (about 6 inches)."
4.0,"Super late review! Bought these compression socks way back in 2016 and don't recall having purchased these at all! Fast forward 5 years later, found them in the back of my dresser as I was packing for cross-country move. Now I wear them on work days where I know I have rapid turnover cases and will be on my feet for 10+ hrs. Definitely helps circulation! Legs feel less swollen and less tired at the end of the day! EKG colorful pattern is fun. Holds up well in the wash too. I docked a star only because you could get packs of compression socks in fun patterns for a better value. But otherwise, I would recommend. Hope this review helps."
4.0,It’s cute but the bottoms look like I wet my self
4.0,"These are alright, but they lose a star for being so heavy on the face. After just a brief period of use, they leave huge dents on your nose. Not comfortable at all, & not good for impromptu photos. (Who wants big marks on the bridge of their nose in pictures?) Other than that, a nice Dwayne Wayne imitation."
4.0,The toe box is narrow and fit tight. My daughter was bummed because they were &#34;sparkly and cool&#34; . Had to return them:(
4.0,"It's a nice dress to have for your day to day casual encounters. I think I could have gotten a XL versus the XXL. It's not too big, I think I would have liked a more tight fit. Overall, great dress."
4.0,Great shirts for the price.
4.0,Such a perfect little dress. It is very see through so we had to put shorts and a tank under.
4.0,"When I first put one on, I thought it was too small, but then I adjusted the straps and it fits perfectly now."
4.0,"Shorts are good. The are a tiny bit shorter than I like, but they are comfortable and look good."
4.0,"This was a gift for a very dear friend of mine. However, I examined it before giving it to her, as I make jewelry for craft fairs, and I have to say I wasn't completely thrilled. The link connecting the moon and the Slytherin Pendant was too long and didn't fit like they show in the picture. I tried to replace it, but everything I tried ended with the same result. In the end, I kept the moon and made a buckled out of it for a leather journal, as for the pendant, I used a darker silver chain I had, and gave it to my friend, who wears it religiously."
4.0,"The Midi Go 3.0 is a brilliantly designed diaper bag but it's just too big for me! It would have been perfect when I had 2 little ones in diapers. The pocket design is smart and easily accessible, and I love the huge drop-in cupholders on the sides. (Vs. cramming a travel mug into JuJuBe's too-tight elastic pockets!) Unfortunately I have to exchange this one for the smaller version, because I have no reason to haul around a massive backpack anymore. But if you're looking for a diaper backpack that can fit all the essentials for a full day out with little ones, this is a great deal."
4.0,My wife loved the ear rings!
4.0,Ear loops not adjustable
4.0,Beautiful dress and it came in time for Thanksgiving. My only issue is the bust doesn't account for women who have larger than a B cup so I had to sew the buttons together so I wouldn't give a show away.
4.0,I am not crazy about the shine to the fabric.  It's a cute pattern and fits well.  Maybe once it's washed and wearing at night.
4.0,The earrings are very cute and I get compliments when I wear them. The reason for the four stars is because they turn my ears green. 😕
4.0,"This is very cute, but it did not fit my 7 lb dog and I ordered her a Medium. It was too tight to even get on her."
4.0,"I was super nervous about this dress since it was my first dress purchase from amazon and it is so cute! Other reviews are accurate in the dress is a little thicker, but I love how the slip underneath isn’t fitted. The arms are a little tighter than I’d hoped but other than that I am very excited to wear it!"
4.0,FITS A LITTLE TO CLOSE FOR XL
4.0,"Really cute dress. I ordered a medium and need to send back and get a small as it's too large in the waist and hips.<br /><br />The lace material is stretchy -- so don't worry too much about your arms :)<br /><br />I do not like the built in belt.  I will likely remove this and replace with another belt.  It doesn't stretch around the entire waist (only the front) and doesn't function as a belt -- so can't be cinched.<br /><br />The waist is slightly too low on my frame, which makes my tummy look larger than it is.  This is part of the reason I'll exchange for a small.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 139 and have an hour glass figure.  When I cinched the back of the waist, I had about 3&#34; of give -- so hopeful that the size down will help."
4.0,beautiful look very tight compression for womens size 7 shoe
4.0,above average for the price. Good look and feel. I have purchased 40.00 cufflinks that feel the same as these.
4.0,"Feels a little cheap as it does retain creases after being worn for a while, and the holes I use the most often are starting to fray. Pictured is what I'm using the band for - a little costume piece for the 999 game."
4.0,A little long. Collected all the dust and hair on the floor.
4.0,This was a gift for an unfortunate child at Christmas.  I was satisfied with it.
4.0,"My fiancé loves the ring, we just wish it came in half sizes as well."
4.0,"I love it for an anklet. The other one (not pictured) is slightly shorter and doesn’t fit on my ankle, but works for a bracelet. There’s 2 different holes to be able to size it. It’s held together even while showering with it. And I honestly feel more balanced."
4.0,Very cute. Good value for price.
4.0,Was not really pleased with the material. The fit is good though.
4.0,"I got this for a superhero 5k, and now I'll probably reuse this as my Halloween costume too!<br /><br />I did end up cutting out the super prickly puffy stuff that makes the skirt pop (tulle? Crinoline? Whatever it's called). There was no way to run with that scratching my skin even with shorts underneath. Wrinkles iron out easily<br /><br />I'm 5'5&#34;, 34b, usually wear a size 8 and always a medium girl with broader shoulders. This fit perfect, surprisingly! It's a stretchy, satin-like material."
4.0,"The material is a bit rough but TOTALLY worth it. I don’t like the belts for my body since I’m all hip and butt however, all three fit great and are not too short. They each pass the sit down test and make me feel so cute. I love cardigans and it’s convenient to have this one “painted” on. So excited to show this off at work!"
4.0,"This hoodie is well-made and vibrant, and the seller honored the rush shipping and even got it to me several days early. However, the size guidelines say:<br /><br />""NOTE: It Comes In Asia Size, Asian Size Is Usually Smaller Than US Size, Please Choose 1-2 Size Up For A Better Fit And Compare Size Detail Before You Purchas.""<br /><br />I bought this in large for someone who wears a medium, and it's way too big. I definitely wouldn't go more than 1 size up, and probably not at all."
4.0,"I love the color & texture of this bag. The size & weight are good too. However,  there is a lack of interior construction,  so it &#34;slumps&#34; and doesn't hold its shape when you put it down.  Perhaps not a problem if you stuff your bag, but an inconvenience for those of us that like to travel a little lighter."
4.0,Made for a great gift.
4.0,I ordered Pink but received Coral. Disappointed but since I like the fit and soft material I decided to keep it.
4.0,good value.  nice product.  works exactly as expected.
4.0,It is not wrinkle-free so keep that in mind. Otherwise I like it!
4.0,Love this blouse but too small not true to size
4.0,Quality wasn't perfect but shirt gets the expected reaction from people who know the anime. Fit as expected
4.0,I've been looking for this kind for ever. They are nice and warm and they are not tight on my leg. I really like them.
4.0,Just adorable!  My granddaughter loves them.
4.0,what i expected it's light plastic.  It's just for fun.
4.0,"These are small wings. Like for an under 5 child.  They're made with a heavy duty card board. I glued a 2 inch piece of fabric in the middle to add a little more to them and put them on the back of my dining room chairs for a beautiful christmas decoration. It was a good value for an awesome decoration. We have brushed past them dozens of times and they are holding up.<br />My cats have even  tried playing witht them and they don't fall apart.  Surprising, because they are so cheap.  But they work!. I def. buy them again."
4.0,Lo pienso utilizar para salir de noche
4.0,Gloves are warmer than my other winter gloves. They cling well to steering wheel and are good for driving.  They are bulkier than other gloves (go less easily into jacket pockets)  but fit too tight in 4th and 5th fingers. For that reason I rated them 5 on warmth but only 3 on comfort.
4.0,It seems perfectly lovely: but it wont fit my sony nex c-3 camera.
4.0,Thank you a good quality shirt. Will but from u again.
4.0,My daughter is in a 2T and this was supposed to be a 3T. The tag says 2-3 years. It seems to be only a touch big on her and I had hoped to have her grow into it. Good quality.
4.0,"Great material, great fit, great value."
4.0,"A little big for my tastes, but very cute."
4.0,"I love this thing. I wear it when I go out and get plenty of compliments but it's nice to come home and pull it out, Bc it tickles my nose and upper lip a little.  It's been a great way for me to see if I really wanna commit to a piercing like that also!  It's not fine metals or anything but very much worth it,  especially for the price!"
4.0,Really nice strap.  The leather is soft and comfortable and the red stitching brings out the red tachymeter hand on my Seiko ssb 031.
4.0,"This mask is SO CUTE and the quality is pretty good. The reason I don't use it very often is because my glasses fog up instantly when I do, so I can't wear it with them. It's not this bad with my other masks. It also has a bit of a smell (like chemicals?) which I don't mind as much, but some people might. In any case, it's pretty."
4.0,"This dress is beautiful. I love the whole look and feel of the material with the lace. BUT it runs a tad bit big. I usually wear a size medium, so I bought a medium, but it got a little loose and long. I will be returning my size medium dress and I will re-order a size small. I highly recommend this beautiful dress for any formal occasion, but buy a smaller size"
4.0,Very nice bracket !!!!
4.0,Very cute! I thought these would be scratchy but they are comfortable!
4.0,Normal size and thickness.  Excellent quality.
4.0,The band is heavy and slips
4.0,"I'm 6'0"", long legs and thin.  I was so excited that this romper is actually long enough on me! Now, I'm giving it 4 stars because the rise/length of the romper (I don't know if that's the right word) is a tad too short; i.e. when I sit down, it's too tight and pulls in the crotch/buttock area - like it's riding up. It's fine while standing, but it just pulls in the wrong places upon seating. Like I said, it's the first romper that I've found that's long enough for my tall/thin frame, so I'm keeping it!<br /><br />Also, The fabric does kind of ""pooch out"" on the stomach area (see second pic, where circled), just under the tie due to the pockets (which are also placed a little high on me).  I tied the bow in such a way that it masks the excess fabric."
4.0,It’s a pretty glove and so soft inside
4.0,"I love wearing this skirt but it's much lighter/thinner than expected. Tons of compliments, but also some comments about it making me look ""older""..."
4.0,These lenses came promptly and fit my frames well. The visual acuity could be better but for the price you can't go wrong.
4.0,The box was smashed to where it doesn’t look good at all and it was supposed to be a gift
4.0,Very cute suit! Very cheeky but flattering. The arm/breast pieces do slide down a lot though. There’s also no padding in the top which would’ve been nice to know.
4.0,Love it. Wish the oil smell lasted a little longer.
4.0,"I bought this dress to wear on a trip to Europe. I wanted something pretty and dressy enough for the ballet we were attending, but also something comfortable that would travel well. This dress was perfect. It didn't wrinkle up in my suitcase and was light and comfortable in the heat.<br />One strap came kind of frayed, but I was able to quickly mend it without much effort. The straps are adjustable, so it was easy to get the right fit. Plus, the material has a little bit of stretch.<br />For reference, I'm 5'3, 150, 36DD and I ordered a Medium."
4.0,"it was delivered before the date it said, it was not missing any pieces and it was really cute, i cannot wait to wear it."
4.0,"Nice booties for the price! They look and wear well. There is almost negative arch support, though, so be aware of that. I ordered size 8 and they ran a little big, but I don't mind because that means I can wear thick socks when it's cold out."
4.0,ok so far.
4.0,"I love these belts, I use to buy leather belts but they would break where the buckle was attached or they would peel.  What I love is that they can be easily adjusted to fit your comfort and still keep your pants up.  The buckle is easy to use and simple to unbuckle when needed.  Unlike cloth belts that twist and turn.  These stay where there at, no twisting or turning.  The only complaint I have, is that they are a little tight to get through the belt loops."
4.0,When i received it The actual key blade itself was amazing i loved the paint work on it. It fits just right in my hand. I would give it 5 stars but when i received it in the mail the small star charm at the bottom was broken and fell off. But nothing a bit of hot glue couldn't fix. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.
4.0,very nice top but a bit big. will adjust it
4.0,Awesome the two blue ones feel cheap made but we will see.
4.0,I like them. A bit snug but they serve my purpose.
4.0,"Costume was as expected. The only problem was that one of the velcro pieces for the face mask was not attached to the elastic string and had to be hand sewn on. No biggie though, took 2 minutes to do. My son is happy with his Halloween costume!"
4.0,"Great quality & fun to switch out and wear different ones every day. except i HAD to switch them every day, cus they were too small and fell out in my sleep."
4.0,"Great colors, looks great on the suit jacket"
4.0,"The size of the insert, it's quite larg and doesn't bend to reach the end of the boots..."
4.0,"The shoes are super cute and thick, just a little difficult to get on.  But great for cold weather."
4.0,they were good
4.0,"Love this one. Large purchased. Fits as expected. 5'7, 150lbs. Happy with purchase."
4.0,"Looking good so says its merino wool, manufactured in China though so not sure. Hopefully it will be quick dry wool!!!"
4.0,"I didn’t have high expectations of the skirt but I actually really like it. Like another review said the draw string is only for show, which is annoying given that it wouldn’t have cost any more to make it real. But none the less it looks cute on and it’s a great length. I’m too old for short skirts and this one is the perfect length. Not frumpy and not inappropriate either. I’m 5’4, 118 pounds and I got a small"
4.0,Good not great.
4.0,Carbon fiber matches my dash! Nice size
4.0,Easy to buckle and unbuckle.
4.0,"It’s a really nice dress. Comfortable and easy to move in. The lace detail was beautiful and the cut I thought was really flattering. It didn’t hug my two birthed kid tummy too much so I wasn’t self conscious. I always look for really short dresses on the models in hopes they’d fit little people like me. This dress hit right above the knee which is wasn’t a bad length. A little shorter would have been nice but I take what I can get. But since it is longer the lace part at the top is also longer and you could see my bra peeking out at the top. Why not go braless you ask? Well for little people like me we also need all the oomph we can get at the top too. So I’d need a strapless or one of those sticky ones, regardless you would still see it. It wasn’t tight which is nice because I also like to breathe and eat. But because it wasn’t tight, if I bent over you might see too much. I can see this dress fitting beautifully on someone just a bit taller. Also, the detail around the armpit was more frilly and pronounced then I expected. Unfortunately I have to return it."
4.0,I really like this style but can't find it anymore in non-polarized style without spending more than I would like. The polarized style is a bit weird when looking at the ground or phone occasionally but will adapt.
4.0,"Great to keep water bottles cold, but my son (5 years old) found it uncomfortable to carry. I plan to buy a shoulder strap pad to help. Otherwise, great product!"
4.0,"This is a very well made strapless bra.  But just didn’t like the way my breasts sat in it.  Very high quality with optional straps.  Had a wide band with four hooks which is what you need for XL breasts.  If you need a strapless, this is a good one."
4.0,"This doesn’t lay flat on my skin, because I’m new to this I’m not sure if there supposed to or not. Either way cute"
4.0,Love this dress fit like a glove. The only thing I feel that wad a downside that isn't big was the bow on back is detachable.
4.0,"Beautiful flattering top and great color.<br />Thinner material but not see through. Downside is that it is very short, especially if you have a larger chest that takes up some space at the top. I’m 5’1 and it is too short on me (I’m an XL). I would have to wear opaque tights or leggings underneath and even so I don’t think it’s work appropriate length on me. Maybe for skinnier chested ladies"
4.0,"I like it, it's a fine piece of jewelry; only wish that was bigger and the hole for attach it in the chain was bigger as well."
4.0,"Love them, I had to arrange them differently because of my large fingers."
4.0,Cute and sturdy. It has enough space for all of my cards. The zipper catches a little at times but overall I really like this wallet.
4.0,So cute and photographed well. My daughter purchased these for her bridesmaids. Great value!
4.0,I love the quality and look of this bag. It’s just hard to open and close bag and gets annoying.
4.0,"It is roomy and slouchy.  The hardware and classic shape makes it a keeper for me. Nice for the price. Be aware that only the flaps,are leather.  I guess Pu means faux in Chinese.  Mostly soft vinyl buy nice for the price."
4.0,"They fit perfectly, super soft and  are made of good quality. The pouch it came in is super convenient to store them in, since I didn’t have to use them all. However, there were supposed to be 8 and I only received 7."
4.0,I am a plus size woman with a thick wrist. I wear the Apple brand Large band just two holes in. This band is much longer. Not annoying for me but if you have a smaller wrist it might be.
4.0,was too big - but I was in a jam and needed it for a country western wedding.  I can have a leather smith put an extra hole in the leather to tighten it - then it will be perfect!
4.0,They arrived quickly but one post had been bent and was super hard to get in my ear. Then the rubber/plastic earring back randomly fell off and so did my earring. So I walked around with only one in for the rest of the night.
4.0,Really pretty!  Hips a bit tight for a fuller figure.  Perfect Yoga lady figure!
4.0,"Box is a little flimsy, but the badges seem to be good quality, and I got it for my uncle for Christmas, and he loved it!"
4.0,too width
4.0,The headband is a little tight but if you put it around something to kind of stretch it out it fits better(: I love it! And quick shipping! Got it in 2 Days.
4.0,Could use a little more detail in the casting but for the price goes well with the  Masonic Kilt Sporran and works well with the Fly Plaid.
4.0,prety watch. it serves the purpose
4.0,"I thought I had ordered a medium, but got a large- I suspect they will shrink. Very thin material, but inexpensive and will be primarily home loungers"
4.0,Nice charm. Neclace is short and would have liked a bigger one (for larger neck size). Purchased as gift.
4.0,"Hubby tried them on and said&#34; yea, they work&#34;  Glowing praise for him."
4.0,"Love this dress! It fits great. After washing it, I was concerned that it may have shrunk..however, I haven't since worn it so I can't verify this. Even if it's smaller, I can wear it as a cute blouse with some jeans."
4.0,I'm busty it Ran small I returned for a larger size. Dress is well made seams are finished on the inside. Fabric stretches but wrinkles when you sit down. Perfect garden party dress. Maybe a casual bridesmaid dress.
4.0,Gorgeous! Runs small
4.0,"Very attractive and compact for travel.  Deducted 1 star because I believe I received a second- not a first quality product. Item was defective- had a wrinkled lining where the cloth was not glued in properly.  Returned it, sadly."
4.0,"No leaking or fogging.  I was hopping the lenses would be a little bit wider, but still the best pair of goggles I've ever gotten."
4.0,The only thing about it that I don't really like is that the hole is so far UP on the head.  I have to tilt it back more than I would like in order to get my ponytail in it.
4.0,Firs perfectly. Just had to get it hemmed.
4.0,"I found some difficulty using this tool on my Clearly Charming Shiny Starter Italian Charm 18 Link Bracelet at first but once it came together it really helped setting up my bracelet to the perfect look. I do wish they would have included a guide to help show you how to work the tool, but I've found myself using it to swap certain charms into different positions and it only taking a minute or so."
4.0,Beautiful dress. Just not quite right for my event.
4.0,Very pretty but also very small.  Might be better suited for a very small person. Sadly had to return them.
4.0,Little less cozy but looks good
4.0,Its really cute a little big but good
4.0,My daughter's feet are a bit wide and straps don't seem to fit quite right.
4.0,It’s Nice!
4.0,"These sunglasses are so cute! I got this product in black and it compliments every outfit that I have. This product comes with a case, a cleaning cloth, and a cute bracelet that says Woodies on it. I love the wooden sides because they add so much character to the sunglasses. I think they are a bit fragile since it is made out of wood. Just be careful when opening and closing them so they don't break. They do a great job at blocking the sun when you are outside. I also love the cat eye looking frames. They are so different to other sunglasses and reminds me of something Shay Mitchel would wear. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,These earrings are beautiful. Fast shipping and as advertised product. My only complaint is that they're a little larger than I expected and therefore they're a little heavy for my earlobes. I just move them to the middle hole and they're just perfect:)
4.0,They were reasonably priced and fit great.I loose gloves in the winter. Now I can replace them and not pay a huge price.
4.0,This was a nice cheap replacement for my last wallet insert. Everything I had in my old one fit into this one.
4.0,I really liked this shirt but it fit just a little larger then I would like. I'm normally a medium and that's what I bought. If you like a looser fit then go with the size you normally would. I'm actually going to return the medium and order a small.
4.0,Really nice looking shirt<br />Quality materials<br />worth the price<br />Compliments the first day
4.0,It is too big. Wish it fit better
4.0,Nice purse. It was a little too small is why I returned it.
4.0,"Love the shape !! The best thing I like about this earrings is the shape of it. The shape is very unique and earrings are crafted/made very well. The silver quality is very good and looks sophisticated when you wear it. No redness or rashes yet after wearing this. I would have given it five stars if the design in the earrings would have been more clear. I think the diamonds and the small dots of silver gets mixed up with each other, you can hardly make out which is what. Other than that everything is exactly same as the specified in the product description. The backing of the earrings have 925 stamp on it. It comes in velvet draw string bag which is good for storage or gifting as is. I like this earrings and will continue using them.  Overall happy with my purchase. Received at discounted price for a fair and unbiased opinion. All statements made are my own and are honest. If you found this helpful please click on &quot;helpful&quot; button. Thanks !!"
4.0,These ran a little big but are easy to put on and are super cute. The ears are glued down rather than sewn so they will probably come unglued at some point. Bottoms have grip so they aren't slippery. We like them.
4.0,Nice comfortable shoe
4.0,"The cloak was pretty nice! the material used wasn't the nicest in the world but you get what you pay for. The length was perfect for my boyfriend and I but If you're over 6'3 you might have some length issues... the color was okay, I wish it was darker but it did say it was grey. overall it was very nice."
4.0,nice..collects dust from everywhere though..
4.0,They were great! Smaller than I had anticipated but worked just fine!!
4.0,"This dress was very lightweight and fit true to size. The white color is pretty see through, but if you have the right undergarments on you will be fine."
4.0,I wore this hat in 100 degree weather and it worked perfectly. The brim was wide enough to protect my face but it didn't get in my way. I got compliments on the cute bow closure in the back of the hat. I was worried it wouldn't fit because I have a lot of hair but I put it up in a ponytail and the hat fit just fine. No band markings on my forehead either. Great purchase!!
4.0,"This review is for Rongxing® Jewelry Fashion Wedding Rings Blue Crystal Womens Black Gold Ring Size 5-10<br />This is a lovely ring  in a darkish, almost gunmetal grey/black with a main stone in blue aquamarine color, several stones are set<br />around the main stone &amp; right on either side are one stone set in a flower setting.  There are 10 mini stone on the side of the band.<br />I love how it looks on. I'm in love with the design. It reminds me of some antique rings I've seen at Estate Sales but could never afford.<br />It feels comfortable &amp; has kept its color.  No turning my finger green. All stones seem to be set securely.<br />I have received several compliments on this ring &amp; couldn't be more pleased with it.<br />Disclaimer: I received these pretty ring for testing the product &amp; providing my honest opinion. Regardless,<br />all opinions expressed are still my own &amp; have not influenced my review. I have not been paid to review this product &amp; have no relationship<br />with the manufacturer or seller. My review is intended to help shoppers make decisions on their purchases."
4.0,"There are less expensive straps around, but none that I found as attractive as this (and other SHerrin's Threads straps). It's the old saw about if you can find one you love as much as this one, but less expensive, then buy it.  If you can't find one you like as much, then it's either pay the freight or settle for something less."
4.0,"I normally wear a 2XLT, Under shirts as well others... The product was received. However when I placed one on, it did absolutely nothing as a compression shirt. The overall appearance: e.g. Craftsman Ship look great, as for stitchery. But the compression was no more than a normal Hanes Shirt. The Shirts tried on: i.e. Three as packaged, fit just as previous T-Shirts. I'll request a return authorization, and maybe try a smaller Size or just continue to do plank exercises!"
4.0,My daughter likes it very much.
4.0,The dress was very good quality and well made but it ran small.  It was very pretty. I usually wear medium which is what I ordered but it was extremely small.
4.0,Got these shorts today and I’m obsessed!! They’re extremely comfortable and so flattering. I wish the color was a little darker but they’re cute! The pockets are also great!! Love these and would suggest anyone to get them!!
4.0,"Grate product, fits perfectly."
4.0,Fit is just OK
4.0,"This item doesn't have a good waist band, so the fit leaves potential muffin top. The block print is great though!"
4.0,"The band was a nice weave, however the attaching hardware for quick change was too long for my very narrow wrist. I wish it would have worked for me. Nice band though."
4.0,Watch looks good. Case is very nice. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is the color of the hands verses the face make the hands difficult to see.
4.0,It looks just like the photo. I tryed to put it in and I was not able to put it in just yet but It was worth buying.
4.0,"I love the fitted style, they stay put! Maybe I have a big face, or my ears are too far back (😆), but I had to remove the elastic sliders, and the elastic is still just a tad tight.  But definitely not a problem.  The Tshirt jersey knit is so comfortable.  The pocket for filters appears to be very well placed.  The pocket on previous Tshirt jersey knit masks would slide into my mouth when talking, but so far, so good with this one.  I will be recommending these!"
4.0,"This is a handy little rain jacket.  I've worn it on my noon walks during a good rain and stayed dry & comfortable.  It does not seem like it's sturdy enough to last for long, though. The hood is very long & hands down over my eyes -- even when I roll it up. An inexpensive answer to my need to be outdoors to run & walk.  Does the job."
4.0,A great little package to keep near by during the spring months here in Indiana.
4.0,Its a bit small but can use as a gift for one of my nieces.
4.0,"This is a super cute little jumper.  My daughter wears a size 8 on top and a size 4-6 on bottom depending on the brand.  I bought her the size Medium and it was still a tad big on her.  She is 5'6"" and 127 lbs.  I think the small would have been perfect but it's not worth returning to China."
4.0,I'm loving not having a buckle!
4.0,"Very nice top, good material, order true size fits as expected"
4.0,"These work great,  the only bummer is that one of the bows ripped off one side the day I got them."
4.0,"This DRESSIS Sleeveless V Neck Dress is super cute and very well constructed.<br />The 96% Polyester / 4% Spandex material is of very nice quality and soft to the touch.<br />The dress features 8 panels, 4 on the front and 4 on the back portion, All panels are securely stitched together and should hold up well over time.<br />The top of the dress is fitted, while the bottom is flared, offering a classic, contemporary overall style.<br />The V Neck is long enough to accentuate the neckline without being overly revealing.<br />Seams and Hem are Lock Stitched for increased durability. There are No Zippers,Buttons or Snaps. It's a one piece Dress that slips over your head to put it on.<br /><br />On the downside, in spite of the seller stating &#34;runs small&#34;, the sizing chart is Not accurate,<br />I normally wear a women's size 4, so I ordered the dress in a size Small (4-6 per sizing chart).<br />While I can get it on, it's so tight that it's difficult to breathe, so I would definitely advise ordering a Full Size Larger than you normally wear.<br />For me it's a real disappointment, as I received a discount in exchange for evaluation and offering my honest, unbiased review and Amazon does not allow for exchanges on purchases made with discount codes. I emailed the seller directly twice, to see if they could work out an exchange, because I really love the design and quality of this dress, but they never responded, so I am out the money I paid for the dress and will end up giving it away.<br />A+++ rating on the Dress but poor Customer Service response, for which I have deducted a Star."
4.0,"Although this shirt keeper, I suppose, works as designed - I'm not completely thrilled with it. The holes for securing the end have worn out in several locations, fairly quickly, causing me to have to adjust the tension, and the location I wear this.<br />In my experience, you have to wear it fairly tight for it to stay where it should, and not shift around on you throughout the day. Additionally, if your like me and not obese, it can definite leave marks on the front of your hips after being worn all day. (Think: underwear that is too tight).<br />I'll continue to use it, for lack of better options (I don't like the stirrup style shirt stays), but will continue to try and get away from it to something better."
4.0,Excellent. Nice quality hardware and nice texture to the band.<br />I'd recommend.
4.0,These shoes were very cute! They were very comfortable. And they were well priced. The only flaw was that they didn't last too long and they got soaked in water after one day of wearing them in the rain.
4.0,I bought 3 of these and for some reason they all fit differently. The camouflage one fit me perfect. This one and the blue are a lil tight trying to put on but once it's on it's OK. Only problem is the straps rip very easily if you're not careful.
4.0,Cute!  But runs very small.
4.0,"Disclaimer:  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />This is the very first pair of bike shorts that I have owned.  I am only able to compare it to riding with non-padded clothing.<br /><br />Since purchasing this product and receiving it I have only been able to use them on two short rides of 5-6 miles each.  On the first ride, I decided to test them out on a variety of road surfaces while on my mountain bike.  I rode over paved highway, smooth gravel, washboard gravel, and dirt roads.  The padding was very comfortable on the buttocks.  However, the padding was not comfortable in the crotch.  The padding on the buttocks was supportive enough that I was able to remain seated for the most part going over washboard gravel at 30 miles an hour downhill.  I ended the ride without any soreness in the buttocks though I had been sore from a previous ride a week or so earlier.<br /><br />On the second ride, the shorts were more comfortable in the crotch area and continued to be comfortable in the buttocks.  This ride was over washboard gravel.<br /><br />Initially, I thought that perhaps the padding would be better if it did not extend into the crotch area.  Perhaps it is something that I need to get used to.  I do not know for sure.<br /><br />However, the shorts are stylish and fairly comfortable for the price (even without a discount).<br /><br />I would definitely purchase these again if I had the choice between riding without padding or using these shorts."
4.0,"Looks and fits great but my wife says it scratches her skin , hopefully with a watch some of the excess chemicals will wash off,"
4.0,The material is cheap but looks and feel pretty solid although the glass brilliant is not pretty well glued to the earring base. Other than that is a nice piece of fashion jewerly
4.0,"I really like these tops. I read reviews before, so I knew to buy a size larger.  The fit is good.<br />I have a little bit larger mid section and the top is slightly looser but they are so comfortable.<br />A must buy!"
4.0,"Very similar to cashmere. Long, wide, and heavy. The grey/pink color didn't look so nice in person (grey is too dark and pink is very pale). But the quality of this scarf is pretty good."
4.0,Very cute and serves its purpose. Could be thicker though
4.0,I loved the bracelet but didn’t realize just how big it was.
4.0,Delivered quickly and a quality product
4.0,Everything is fine except the length of the fly. It should be longer so I don't have to pull it down.
4.0,It was very nice good quality
4.0,"Like the dress, like the color (mustard,) but it’s way long.  Will need hemming."
4.0,I like the color blue and the length is good for me.
4.0,"i like the color, style, and comfort around the neck."
4.0,Cute dress. Stretches and fits to your body. I just don’t like how orange the flowers are in person. Was hoping for a brighter yellow
4.0,These are OK. They are larger than I expe Ted. Fun to wear.
4.0,5'2 95 lb girl here. I bought the dress in the smallest size and it was a little large.
4.0,"Beautiful coat but ran a bit smaller than I expected. I normally wear an extra large and so I sized up to a 2X and it still fit tighter than I like around my butt and shoulders. It is fairly warm, I've been wearing it in -3 to 19 degree weather and even though it is too tight to really layer anything underneath, it keeps me pretty warm. My absolute favorite feature is the oversized hood, its wonderful....once you finally finish fighting with the buttons to attach the fur trim :)"
4.0,"Cute, snug fit."
4.0,"Nice looking pants and very comfortable, but the inseam was far longer than stated.  I had to pay an additional $15 to have them altered."
4.0,These are very comfortable and fit nicely.  Lots of pockets (on the backside and legs) I like them for a change from jeans
4.0,This is a super cute band and really comfy. Easy to install. But it felt like it got stretched out a bit fast.
4.0,I really liked the quality and color of this robe. But I had to return it due to the size running a bit large.
4.0,Good neck ties
4.0,"The latch on both sides are rather difficult to get apart. Honestly, other than that this is a great product and my wife loves it."
4.0,gave it to charity
4.0,Didn't love the fabric anything else is fine thank’s
4.0,Purchased for my daughter and she loves it. It's cute. A little pricey for plastic but we'll made.
4.0,Kind of hard to see the character face on left corner since it is cut off of the picture. I like the material it is made of will last long
4.0,"Very nice, but should have had a red mask included in pack."
4.0,"I am 5’4” weight 196 I carry my weight well meaning my mid section is not that big, I love the outfit it looks great but the material is very thin and see through...which isn’t too bad because it’s summer time! Does show lots of cleavage which I don’t like so I’d have to wear a halter top or really cute bra that you don’t mind someone seeing or great for small breast women!"
4.0,"Overall this is decent quality though it could be better.  A few things to note about it:<br /><br />-  When we saw the pictures of the product online, it appeared very colorful and that it would look great when you wear it but when we received it, we observed that it is a bit dull<br />-  it is decent fit<br />-  the design is also appears to be too busy and it loses out on simplicity<br /><br />So its decent but could be better"
4.0,"Excellent clarity, great price. The picture does not do it justice.<br />High quality clasp."
4.0,"Love this shirt, but order up a size! I usually wear a small but ordered a medium."
4.0,"Aviator Glasses to keep the glare out of you eyes.  The color may not be for everyone, but the sure do get the job done, they are glare free, UV protection, and stylish."
4.0,"It is a tad small for my 7 year old son, even though we bought an 8"
4.0,Nice wrist watch for the price
4.0,It is small on me but would probably fit somebody else I know.  It is a pretty dress
4.0,I loveeee these pants the only reason I gave them a 4 was because they have some strings sticking out but they can easily just be cut off.
4.0,"Hem line is flattering and will cover the mom gut if you have one. The color is amazing! The high neckline is flattering. The underwire is a bit on the wide side and doesn't give my girls much support so might just remove it. I'll have to see how it looks when the suit it wet. For comparison I'm a 36D cup, jeans I wear 14 and I'm usually a size L for tops.<br /><br />This top is worth the money!"
4.0,"It's a nice earring. Just beware... I didn't read the description that well, apparently, cuz I was expecting a pair. This is just a single ring."
4.0,Liked overall.
4.0,Same as pictured. The bows are glued and promptly fell off.
4.0,Love it but the diamond 💎 fell out pretty easily. Either way it is so special to me.
4.0,Just as advertised...Great fit!
4.0,pretty hard to adjust the length. Very cute though!
4.0,"These are really well made socks. I'm convinced they are going to last a long time. My problem is that they are very short. I prefer two types of socks - no see um socks that are below the ankle or calf length socks that stay up when I pull them up. These are in between. They don't stay up because they are not designed to. So they bunch around your ankles. I could do without that. Otherwise, these are really nice looking and well crafted socks that should last for years."
4.0,"I bought the small but, because I'm a very small person, they didn't give as much compression as I would have liked.  They were fine, of course, but Cold Gear compression sports shirts were more firm."
4.0,Es demasiado trasparente
4.0,"The color is rich and it seems to be well-made. The pockets are deep enough to be functional. The material is a bit heavy. The wash instructions are interesting. 65% cotton and 35% polyester somehow equates to dry cleaning or washing separately. Regardless, it has survived a couple of normal washes in my LG machine and is still in great condition."
4.0,So nice for the price
4.0,Bought as a gift.  Nephew likes it.
4.0,"These clip-ons are the brown-looking orangish lenses. I should have known better than go by the picture which should show the correct product that you're selling, because what it shows are the ones that I wanted, the dark colored gray ones. And the description says ""Description: these are the gray lens not the driving lens.""<br />But they're not they are like I said orangish colored ones.<br />Otherwise good communication with seller regarding an email question I asked, quick shipping, and the product is new. I still give them four stars because I should have known better than go by the picture and description. Will use these ones, but will buy the correct ones elsewhere."
4.0,"The color said purple, the pic shows purple. It's not purple. It was a maroonish color. It was still pretty but was expecting purple.  Dress fit true to size. Quality was great. Shipping was super fast."
4.0,If you normally wear a certain size order one size up so it’s not too clingy. But this top is super cute. You can pull it down to wear long like with leggings or you can bunch it around your waist and wear with jeans. It’s not bulky to do this. Thin material but flattering.
4.0,Easy to use and charge lasts a long time.  Sounds better than expected.
4.0,"Love the band, so far my only real complaint is the clasp is a little 'sticky' sometime i must really push and wiggle to get it to open/close. Im sure its something that will get better with time"
4.0,Really nice shorts but didn’t realize we should have sized up maybe 3 or 4 sizes… I ordered my husband his regular size which is a size XL but these were way too small couldn’t even pull them up past his thighs.
4.0,"Cute cheap sweater dress.  It is a little longer than I had expected.  I wish I took a picture.  It looked cute with my new black leggings I was trying on tonight.  I just can not figure out what is the front and the back as there is not a tag on the neck.  I guess it doesn't really matter.  I can't wait for the weather to cool off to wear it and have fun experimenting with possibly a belt so I have a waist.  It is a little baggy and boxy looking.  I ordered a small and am about 5'5"" 115 lbs."
4.0,"I am so in love with these shoes! They are so beautiful! It's a little strange tho, the front of it is pretty big and I have small ankles so to me it looks like I have clown shoes on, I don't really care tho, these shoes are adorable and everyone I see loves them."
4.0,Looks exactly like the photo. Material was unexpectedly stretchy. Which ended up being nice since the fit was slightly smaller than normal.
4.0,Making gifts
4.0,"I'm sort of in between sizes right now, but I read previous reviews and saw that this costume ran a bit small. So, I ordered the larger of the 2 sizes I was considering, and it fit perfectly. Wore it to a Steampunk-themed wedding, and got lots of compliments."
4.0,"Real nice, great quality"
4.0,"I was unsure about what size. Reading some of the reviews I took a chance. I am 5'3"" 140lbs and wear 34DD. I usually wear med. I decided to buy this sleeveless sweater in XL. I am very pleased with the fit. Not tight but not too loose. It was a perfect fit.I only gave it 4 stars because not sure how it will wash."
4.0,This suit is super cute and slimming. It is Asian sizing so I had to order an XL. I am 5'4&#34; 135 and I usually wear a S/M. Everything else was as expected. Good buy.
4.0,"very soft material, fit her nicely; however this is not red, dark pink, tomato.... it is bright pink and the bow is baby blue. slightly disappointed."
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. I needed a thin but moderately durable pair of cotton gloves that would breathe well. The size chart is also correct; my hand measurement is exactly 8.5&#34; so these were a perfect fit. Made in China... the stitching quality is haphazard inside of the glove, but these are pretty nice and comfortable compared to other gloves at this cost."
4.0,"This bag is smaller than what I normally carry, however, it has a lot of space.  The color is vibrant and it has a long strap for cross body that makes it a great weekend bag."
4.0,Great glasses for a great price....
4.0,This is a beautiful top. But it is not for me. The arms are too small. The material is too thin. I brought a xxlarge. I love these tops but they do not love me so therefore if you are not young and thin don't buy them . They make you dumpy.  I should know I have six different kinds that i have brought off Amazon.
4.0,It is really cute!  I am 5 feet and 120 lbs.  Fit was perfect (small).  THe skirt is &#34;crunchy&#34; as in very stiff but it is so cute.
4.0,"Went to Fitbits site and they wanted to charge $129.95 for a comparable model. Talk about savings. Sturdy build quality, tools to change link  sizes included and easy to use. Works as good as the original it came work with."
4.0,"This is pretty but it is hard to find the right clothing combination to wear it with, which is why I gave it  four stars.  I am even struggling with this one.  I wore it with a black sheath dress."
4.0,"I love this dress. It looks as good on as it does in the picture. At 5'10&#34;, I am not a short person but this dress is way to long for me. I bought it last year and even bought platform heals to wear with it but decided to wear a different dress because of foot comfort. I may wear it this year and have it altered but I'm afraid if I alter it, I will lose too much detail along the bottom hem of the dress."
4.0,"My son is super into baby shark so I had to get this for him to wear for the holiday season. It's a comfortable shirt without tags that always bother him. I bought a size up so he could wear it longer but it came bigger than I expected. He may get a couple of years out of it now. The print has started to fad a little bit after a few washes, but nothing too terrible. All in all, a good buy."
4.0,Very summer looking. For the money I really like for the purse. I love that it sits upright. I can find everything easily
4.0,Just a little short but otherwise love the dress.
4.0,It seems just like in the picture. I order a small size which I am returning for  a bigger size.
4.0,"Very light weight.  The elastic in the waisted is not sewn down so it does roll. After 2 washings, mine have several holes where the seam was not done correctly. Will not purchase again."
4.0,Good purchase thank you
4.0,"Love em, nice and big, roomy. I wish they were a bit more soft."
4.0,"I saw these, thought they were cute. Packaging good, item arrived on time.<br /><br />The only thing I will say I didn't really care for, is that the color tone of the stainless steel is not as it seems in the online photos. The color is much darker, something that is not my preference.<br /><br />However, all else, meaning the size and design are as described.<br /><br />I would purchase from this seller again. However, if I am really interested in an item, I'd contact them to inquire about the color tone next time."
4.0,"Very well made, very pretty and unique.  Will be buying more for Christmas gifts.  Great for ladies 14 thru ?"
4.0,It does what it advertise.
4.0,Very beautiful charm but scrappy chain. Broke as soon as i got it!
4.0,Love the color and fit. Came with a slip.
4.0,Very comfortable shorts. I don't love the pattern but who sees them? Awesome deal to BOGO from Amazon!!!
4.0,"I agree with earlier reviewer- it is a beautiful and comfortable watch. 4 stars rather than 5 because it is SO expensive and the end of the strap flops around, which is annoying. I've had it a week."
4.0,Love the glasses and the color as well. The glasses were a little wider from side to side then I had expected but I guess I didn't measure accurately. Color was as expected
4.0,Made rather cheaply but does the job. Holds everything for the gym that you need to take with you. If you're a Penn State fan you'll enjoy letting people know it with this bag.
4.0,Granddaughter loves the nightgown.  Did not realize I needed to wash it separately or dry clean the nightgown before I purchased.  It has washed beautifully so far.
4.0,"Nice accessory, great purchase."
4.0,Good price and easy to breath during activities. Not finished but doesn't take much to darn the top portion.
4.0,Although these are not polarized I did email the seller and he quickly offered me another pair.
4.0,"These socks are very soft. I do feel that they run slightly large which may cause them to rub with boots or outdoor activities. They are absolutely perfect for lounging around the house, especially in winter. Very warm and comfy!"
4.0,I loved it vary nice coloring
4.0,Amazing and fast shipping!
4.0,"Exactly what we need it for, my mom has arthritis and I play volleyball, they are very confortable,  just a little hazard to put it on."
4.0,"They look just like the picture and I like them. I took a star because I wore them today for the first time and my nails aren’t done, so my natural nails are a little jagged and when I would rub my nails across the leggings by accident, little strings of fabric would come out, because this material is soft and stretchy, it doesn’t seem firm.  I have other leggings like these and they don't do that and I’ve had them before scrunch butt leggings were a trend, so I hope in the future I don’t have any holes cause I wouldn’t mind ordering another pair.  Also, because they are stretchy if you like a fit that’s a lil firm I would size down. I’m 5,3 and 180 with big hips and butt, I got the medium, but in these i could’ve gotten a small. I like a firm fit to my leggings that feel like they are holding me but not compressing my thighs or butt."
4.0,These are very pretty and well made. I like the color but wish it were a stronger organge. This is sort of a light orange
4.0,Very trendy and lightweight. Fits very well not snug but not too loosely  and looks expensive. I’m very slim and have long arms and it’s a perfect length. It’s very comfortable and great for after the gym on a cooler day or an early morning run. I wrap my around my waist and it’s light enough to not appear bulky
4.0,"Looks nice but it was a bit big, I purchased a large because of previous reviews, I am 5'7&#34; and 156 pounds and a M would have actually been good for me. It is also somewhat see through. I like the stripes, color and overall look."
4.0,"The fabric stuck to you a ton so wear a slip, but overall it was a very cute and flattering dress!"
4.0,Cute but runs a bit tight
4.0,"Shipping took a little long. Glasses have minor air bubbles on the frame. Not a huge problem as it doesnt affect the lenses. Other than that, the glasses have a nice shape, fit well, and look good."
4.0,These are huge! Not that thats a bad thing but just a heads up. The ear straps are adjustable! However i took 1 star away because one is sewn upside down. The wire that goes over your nose has to go on your chin for the word to be right side up.
4.0,the gloves are part of a costume. They lend themselves to modifications and are comfortable. haven't washed them yet but am hopeful they will maintain the size.
4.0,Dress was too small.
4.0,"great retro look, but in comfortable fabric"
4.0,"My wife has limited dexterity due to both a muscle-skeletal disability and beginning arthritis. These gloves are allowing her to practice correct and safe knife-handling with less concern about nicking a knuckle or injuring a slightly misplaced thumb.  After a time she may also share them with the less experienced cooks who grace our kitchen.  We do wish these had been offered ... here on Amazon ... in a size Small, as the fingers do seem to be a tad long on the Medium gloves."
4.0,"Although I really like this wallet, the only downside is that I cannot fit my check book inside and zip it together.  It is a slim design, which has many slot for all of your cards.  Overall, it is a great wallet and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a sleek zip wallet."
4.0,"I love the dress, with a velvet touch and a beautiful wine color. However, the dress is too tented at the waist, not helping the silhouette. The dress also rides WAY up if I lift my arms, but I have a large bust that may be contributing to this."
4.0,This is great for organization.
4.0,"I ordered this dress in the green color and it came just as described. The material was great, very durable and not see through at all. I was hoping that there would be some elasticity to the bust area but there wasn’t, which isn’t a bad thing just make sure to follow the measurement guide. Because I have a larger chest (38 D) I didn’t find this dress very flattering on me, my chest felt pushed down. Also the cut wasn’t very flattering to my body shape either. Other than that it’s a quality product, and would probably look better on someone with a different body structure."
4.0,I didn’t like the metal wire in the mask. I was afraid my 3 year olds would puncture his face so he wear the mask up side down where the metal part is on his chin and not on his nose.
4.0,Very hard to put on.
4.0,The top fits very small.  Bottom a bit on the small side as well.
4.0,It is just what it looks like.  I like the natural look to it.
4.0,It's very plain and simple. But it fits well. It's just okay. It will be a nice staple piece to my wardrobe.
4.0,The glasses looks so nice and premium. I would recommend it!
4.0,"Cute and comfy! Oversized slouchy sweater, looks and fits as expected"
4.0,So cute. I prefer a loose nightie so I bought a size up and glad I did so.
4.0,Great belt for price!
4.0,I bought these to use when mud riding. They dont let the dust through. The night lenses are my favorite. I have a hard time seeing at night. The only problem I had was they fogged up.
4.0,"The hat took a long time to get here, and came wadded up in a bag. But once I unpacked it, and straightened it out, it pretty much took on the shape shown in the ad. It's almost too big for my head, but that's better than being almost too small. I actually like wearing it while mowing, and even sometimes wear it just to keep my hair from blowing. It goes well with my overalls. Farmer Brown look. I like the hat."
4.0,"Item as pictured. Soft fabric. Very lightweight, but good for lounging."
4.0,So soft love them love them
4.0,fun toy
4.0,It sticks well and looks nice under clothes.
4.0,A Christmas gift for my daughter. She loved it!
4.0,"very pretty bracelet, looks well made.  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that it is on the small size.<br />7 1/2&#34; long is for a small wrist.  I am going to have the jeweler add some links."
4.0,"The shoes are very cute and can be worn to work, however they weren't as orhtopedic as I had hoped and they are wider than I can wear. (I typically wear a M width shoe)."
4.0,"As expected. Nice, good looking"
4.0,"It's extremely soft and very long - Which is exactly why I bought it, heeding the reviews that it's too long.  As someone who is 5'11&#34;, maxis never hit their true length on me.  This one does.<br /><br />It's a little big, but I wanted that extra half inch the 3x gave me.  The neckline on this is just strange.  You need a strapless or convertible type bra for this one."
4.0,This looks beautiful on and felt comfortable and soft but a few hours in it started to feel constricting and uncomfortable.
4.0,"This top can be worn casually or you can wear it professionally. It is cute, lightweight and comfortable."
4.0,Beautiful unfortunately the beaded piece on one end came off within an hour. Can't find it to repair.
4.0,"Cute item.<br />I take small & like athletic fit, so female small was good for me. If you like loose fit, order medium.<br />My husband takes large, but this large was snug. So snug we don’t put it in dryer. XL would have been better."
4.0,"It’s exactly what I expected for the price. The suede is nice and the fit was tight at first but then again I have wide feet after wearing for a few hours it’s stretched and fits nicely! The bottom seems a bit cheap so I can tell these won’t last me more than a few months of wear, maybe more time will tell. I posted pics because I don’t think we have enough reviews from big girls on amazon!<br /><br />Also the zipper wouldn’t go all the way up but since the suede fabric is so stretchy it’s forgiving I just had to scrunch it down a bit so it would fit nicely! Would recommend just have realistic expectations for the price!"
4.0,"I bought the light grey. I love the material, it’s sweat wicking and soft not a rough fabric. Also they are mid waist and for perfect at the waist. I love them. But they are a little sheer. It’s not as obvious when you wear light colored underwear<br />If you wear black undies, you can see them"
4.0,The reason why I gave it four stars is because honestly I don't think it is worth $35 especially considering that it's the same key for every winners Bank . Other than that it is a well painted sturdy box I really like the little Pusher it comes with to stick the bills in further if it's very comfortable in the pocket and it has already saved me so all in all I'm happy
4.0,nice quality. Fit as expected. Looked just as in photo
4.0,I liked how it fit. The length of the skirt was perfect.  The arms were a little loose but not too much.
4.0,I bought my husband 3 of these sweatshirts for Christmas and my son 1. They love them! Said they are super comfortable and they like the way they fit. They look great. I will definitely be buying more.
4.0,"It’s a little short on my average torso, but otherwise I love it."
4.0,"I had made a purchase of these in a store several years ago and I was favorably impressed with them at the time. I'm very happy to have found them through Amazon and at a much better cost! I average 14 hour work shifts and I used to experience swelling in my feet and ankles at the end of my day attending to patient needs. No more, and I can't adequately express how grateful I am for this, especially with a family history of diabetes and trying to avoid it and its complications for myself. These are comfortable, nonrestrictive, and like Goldilocks's porridge, &#34;not too hot and not too cold.&#34;"
4.0,"the only thing i dont like about this dress is it rides when you walk, i would recommend wearing leggings or shorts with it. it is very comfortable though."
4.0,"I liked the fir if these joggers. Unfortunately my pantyline showed through, so I returned them."
4.0,Don't wear while driving😂
4.0,"These are sized larger than what you might expect. I wear small and they're loose, I would order a size smaller than what you normally wear."
4.0,I purchased this for myself.  It looks like the picture and I enjoy wearing it.
4.0,"I’m 5’4, 118-123lbs and bought an extra small. The band fits great but they are easily 2-3” above my ankle. Disappointed."
4.0,"Just enough to bring a few things around, some cash, ID, and a few cards. I really like it."
4.0,My friend loved this!  Good size and looks good on a chain.
4.0,Not very good quality but great looking shades
4.0,Got it today and i love had to dip it in some salt water because im swollen but its gorgeous
4.0,"Nice mix shapes, sizes and colors."
4.0,Very nice looking tie!
4.0,"These are cute leggings, with reasonable coverage all the way around (not too thick or too thin), and I absolutely love the two large pockets, each large enough for a smart phone"
4.0,"I wear this band when I go out to dinner, movies, church, et cetera.  I change back to the original band as soon as I get home.  It has come loose from the fitbit several times, but fortunately I have not lost my fitbit."
4.0,My 3yr old daughter loved them!
4.0,"Soooooooo adorable.  I bought the 12-18 month size for my son to wear for 1 yr birthday photos.  It was snug enough that the bottom snaps would pop occasionally, revealing his diaper, but not tight any where else.  The material is great, held up nicely after being washed, and bonus that the suspenders are shown on.  We got lots of compliments!"
4.0,"I love the way these look, but they are very heavy for me."
4.0,Hurts by nose a bit when I wear it to long
4.0,Arrived on time and was a great gift to my parents. However the chain broke on one of them.
4.0,"Got it for my wife.  She's had it a couple of weeks now and received many compliments.  I hope it doesn't tarnish or break due to lack of quality.  Less money usually means less quality.  I hope I'm wrong but so far, so good!"
4.0,This is a very short dress.  It's cute but best wear it with leggings.
4.0,"fits wide, so not a usual fit"
4.0,"You won't confuse them for LLBean  but you also won't be left with an empty wallet. These are well made, comfortable and do the job they are intended for..no complaints here."
4.0,"I love this purchase- the color is awesome and they felt great when I put them on, but after a couple hours they were starting to get loose which is disappointing.  To my horror, these capris show EVERY LITTLE BIT OF CELLULITE I have 😬. So they are my housepants ain’t nobody need to see that!!"
4.0,"This jacket was pretty warm nothing bad I can say about it, I love Barcelona :) great sweater to wear"
4.0,Cute top. Much better quality than what I was expecting. Would buy again.
4.0,Soft & warm.
4.0,Just what I need to keep my hair dry.
4.0,"These were very true to size. I am a xl and ordered xl and fit perfect. I love how they fit and look. Great quality, light sweat pants. I only gave 4 stars because I have one issue and I so wish I didn’t cuz I wanna love these 100 percent. My issue is right past the knee they seemed to have sewed on a separate piece I guess to have the puma logo on side but the sewing trim inside is slightly annoying feeling touching skin because it goes all around leg ( basically is two pieces sewed together )  but it’s not so bad we’re it’s just intolerable, I think after wearing for short period you won’t notice it as much. So I kept them because I love how comfortable they are and the fit is great 👍🏼  for reference I am 5’6 and 210lbs (purchased size XL )"
4.0,"Lovely fabric, fit perfectly"
4.0,I bought this  for my daughter to do a horse show.  Looks professional and clean
4.0,Color was different than picture. Ordered size Small.
4.0,Seems to be about a size larger than I expected.
4.0,"Very comfy, and I like the colors."
4.0,Like shirt but the neck opening isn’t tight up around the neck area
4.0,just the problem with the size
4.0,Nice cross that I use to display in my cars interior.
4.0,It got bumpy on the boob area very soon
4.0,"These shoes are so cute and my daughter loves them! They have a pleasant smell similar to mini melissa shoes. My only complaint is the sizing. The largest size available when I ordered was a 10. I measured my daughters foot which would have been just a little smaller than the size 10 measurements. When the shoes arrived, they have a 13 imprinted on the bottom and they are much too big for my daughter right now. Not sure if I was sent the wrong size on accident or if the shoe measurements are off."
4.0,The product seemed perfect for my need of it except for the size of the waste was way off. They seemed more like a larger medium type size than an xl. I was very disappointed because i loved the look & feel of them for a business dress uniformed look. Im very disappointed<br />That i have to return them with no option to go a size up or two sizes up really from what I orderes. Is there a plus size you can order? Im a normal us14/16 which should of been perfect with the size chart but it just wasnt😫
4.0,Don’t let the picture fool you I assume that this was a solid hand that was 3-D but it is actually flat.
4.0,"I am 5'-8"" and 130 lbs and wear a size Small shirt with 32B bra size. I ordered the medium sized bra in black color. The fitting is perfect. It is comfortable to wear. It stretches and is form fitting. The back has the cross bracing which adds a nice sex appeal.<br /><br />The material of the fabric is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. Unfortunately, the bra material is not breathable and the fabric does not absorb moisture. I get so sweaty at the end of my workouts and usually find my bra soaking in sweat, but this bra just retained moisture and not absorb it. I found my yoga mat just wet from my sweat which I wanted to avoid."
4.0,I love these. The PO accidently delivered them to someone else initially...but thank god for good people b/c they showed up to my door next day. The one thing i will say is thst they can NOT b bent they will break. They r beautiful but the patina on the greenish colored one is very light so maybe order some patina to use yourself...but all together they r really pretty...arrived n great shape & proper numbers & i will purchase again.
4.0,The bangle on the bracelet is not stationary. I thought it would either be stationary or spin all around. Sometimes it turns half way around and I’m constantly adjusting it!
4.0,"It is as described,but I found it hard to locate anything that would hang on it correctly. Most things were too heavy and leaned over, not very  attractive on a chain. Maybe something small and light would work."
4.0,"Shorter than it looks in ad and neckline is very straight across. Warm and soft, not stiff."
4.0,"Pros:  Was skeptical but it fits well. Purchased a more expensive rash guard from dicks sporting goods until I found this one & will definitely be returning the dicks sporting goods one (it was too tight in the arms)!  I would definitely buy more in other colors. Thought the zipper would rub but I didn’t feel it. Will update after trying it out.<br /><br />Love the built in bra, it even has a bra strap to clip in the back.<br /><br />Medium fits 5’5”, 135 lbs. Will update after using this at a water park.<br /><br />Cons: The black bottoms are quite “cheeky”, it looks like more coverage on the picture."
4.0,Not as high as the picture shows but still super cute and I love the rubber on the inside to keep them up!!
4.0,"The button is pretty cheap, beautiful dress but ended up super gluing the button in the front so my bust does not showcase."
4.0,This is definitely thinner than I expected (ordered in pink) - you can see the shoulder pads through the material. The color is hot/neon pink as I expected. I would say it was worth it for the price - I wasn't expecting anything too high quality as this is more for a themed party than daily wear.
4.0,Have bought a few extra wide brimmed hats on Amazon and this one has a better fit.  The quality is good and the brim is wide enough to shade your face in direct sun.
4.0,"Fit great.. bifocal lens is a little larger than expected which is nice.. definitely recommend.<br /><br />I reduced this to four (4) stars... over the weekend I ""dropped"" these glasses and they scratched....which to me shouldn't happen that easily....will continue to evaluate the product."
4.0,Soft cozy cute.
4.0,"Very warm and soft inside and out, not too bulky for driving.<br />Good purchase."
4.0,"4 stars because in the search bar I typed ""Olaf Earrings"" and this product was listed in the results. So I bought thinking I was getting earrings and instead 1 little barely a 1inch pin. Highly upset, my mistake for not reading instead of trusting Amazon search! PRODUCT IS EXACTLY AS YOU SEE- A PIN!"
4.0,"I got two for my daughters, size 5 & 9 and they were great, I like the color and it was comfortable with no damaging for there feet."
4.0,"I didn't expect the apron to be stiff. I thought it was cotton and silk. It is, however, very nice."
4.0,"I loved these boots for halloween. They were a little tight in the toes, but that is to be expected. I wore them almost the entire day. Brought some backup boots &#34;just in case&#34;, but these boots were comfortable for about 7-8 hours."
4.0,"They work as expected -- I haven't cut a finger  using the new mandolin. And each glove can fit on either hand.<br /><br />i am not sure how sturdy they are, particularly since I have not tried any other brands. The one I have used has two ragged fingers where they came in contact with the mandolin blade.<br /><br />Eric"
4.0,Very cute but very short on my daughter. She is tall and thin so we just added extra thick tights.
4.0,"I ordered it for my husband, he liked it. Fabric is pleasant to the touch. I do not know what the real percentage of cotton is there though. I put 4 stars because there were a lot of threads sticking out of the seams"
4.0,gift only
4.0,"These are great! They are a bit snug on my big head, but they dont slip as badly as others I have tried!<br />Cute prints!"
4.0,Beautiful earrings! Great size for young ladies and for those who want a smaller but substantial look.
4.0,"These are super comfy. The sizing is a bit wonky though (for my body type at least). The waist was really large, to the point of slipping down - but the legs were very tight! I personally felt self conscious trying to pass them off as jeans. The mister said, &#34;I don't think I've ever seen jeans quite that... uh.... form fitting&#34;.<br /><br />I might not be able to wear these on all occasions - but I will say these make my ass look FANTASTIC."
4.0,My kid loves pocoyo. The quality is good and it did fit as expected.
4.0,"I found this mask set comfortable to wear and cute, but the straps were a little too long, making the fit too loose. I put a stitch on both sides of the lower loop and they fit much better."
4.0,"This skirt is SO cute. I am 5’8 and I have a lot of booty to contend with, making the skirt very short. It doesn’t go to my finger tips and is a tad tight despite being an XL."
4.0,My daughter loves them. I'm looking forward to seeing how well they hold up.
4.0,As expected. Price and look standpoint its good one. Hope color should not fade from outside.<br /><br />Recommend to buy
4.0,Loved the color and style but not on my body type.  The waist was just a bit too  high and it didn't look right on me.
4.0,Great nato strap even if it is a little larger than 24mm.
4.0,I like the material and the way the jacket fits.  Only used it once so far in 34 degree weather and it kept me warm.
4.0,So far it's holding nicely.  Get multiple compliments on this necklace every time I wear it.
4.0,This is nice quality but runs a little small.
4.0,"Very cute,and quick delivery ! It is a beautiful red, and looks very stylish, but very hot material, I could not wear this in the hot, summer months, so good thing I’m going to beach in March. Great deal for the price, and it’s adjustable on the sides at the bottom."
4.0,"Very pretty, just remember to order a size or two up depending on your chest and arm size."
4.0,Love this.  But it was very wrinkled.
4.0,Seems fine.  Bought it for my son who runs marathons.
4.0,Generally good but they don't stay on crocks (though you can just use a sharpie on those.
4.0,I have been wanting hoops for nose for a while now.. I got my nose done about 5 months ago and have always loved the look of small hoops but I for the life of me can not get any of these in my nose.. I tried so many different ways and nothing.. they are really tiny but very sturdy and well made! Im not giving up yet! They came super fast and all 4 came individually wrapped in a neat velvet black bag. I will update my review once I get my hoop in. I received the product for free or at a discount for my totally honest and completely unbiased review!
4.0,"This tunic seems to be decent, fits nicely, and looks good. My only complaint is that it tends to get caught on the back pockets of pants due mostly to friction, instead of hanging down the way it should. Otherwise, no complaints. Colors aren’t as bright as picture."
4.0,"Just shy of a 5* review because their one size is really for taller women.  I'm 5'2 and they came to my groin area😜...<br />I made it work though with dressy shorts, a pink cashmere sweater, & some cute pumps.  I reversed the bows; one bow stuck out of the back near my rear;) & the other the front upper thigh~cute cute cute~I received plenty of compliments.<br />The feel of them is so smooth, no snags!"
4.0,"I ordered this dress for my vow renewal.  I actually really liked it, but it ran small so I had to send it back.  Plus I would not have been able to lace up the back by myself."
4.0,"The Letters were smaller than I expected. I was missing two letters, but all in all it was worth the buy."
4.0,I recieved my watch yesterday. Some people are dissatisfied due to failures out of the box. For under $20 you can't ask for greatness. These are cheap Chinese watches. But I am lucky. It works well and I will admit the LCD display is negative so it is hard to see a dimly lit room. I purchased it for the analog side of it so I'm happy. Over the past day the LCD and analog do show same time so I'm pleased with my gamble.
4.0,It was nice did fit the way I thought but gave to my son.
4.0,Love that this covers my belly fat.
4.0,"I bought this for my elderly mom, she likes it. The price was amazingly low and it's very easy on and off for her. She has a large wrist, so it was a bit tight even though it's adjustable. It stretches open and closed."
4.0,Adorable! A little larger than anticipated and chain is not the best but the pendants are great.
4.0,"Runs a little small, and a little short on my husband, but looks nice.  Does snag easily.  If you wear a velcro reflective vest for night visibility, this will tear up the shirt very quickly.  Velcro is this shirts enemy."
4.0,The pendant is very sweet and it has special meaning for me.  Would have liked it to be a tad larger so that the inscription was more readable.  But still very nice.
4.0,Returned was the length I wanted.
4.0,"Fit well, just the arm holes are a little small and make some arm fat bulge out a little, but overall really cute top."
4.0,"I do like the shirt, just thought it would be slightly lighter. I got the medium wash. The buttons are cute. Didn't really get to see that detail up close until I received it. I don't think its a 20 dollar shirt though."
4.0,"I bought this necklace because the number 18 kept popping up in my life and then I learned about it's importance in Judaism and figured, maybe I can wear it for good luck?  It's very good quality metal.  It didn't turn my sensitive skin green like most inexpensive jewelry does.  The necklace isn't a choker, but hangs a little lower to around my clavicle.  I forgot to take it off one night and slept with it on and I woke up with the emblem detached from the necklace.  It's my mistake, not the necklace.  But now it is broken."
4.0,"Good slippers, i wear Men's 6.5 and the size that was suggested was 7. The front portion of the slipper fits good, but back by my ankles and heel is loose so i feel like they will fall off. But the snugg-ness  fit in the front is enough to keep them on my feet.  Next time gonna choose closer to my size to see if they fit better."
4.0,"I am a female and I bought these to wear under loose shorts, dresses and skirts.  They fit great.  Tight in the thighs and comfortable-loose around the hips.  The colors aren't as vibrant as I expected and I fear they made fade quickly but I won't know yet.  As far as mens boxes go- they would most likely be perfect.  My husband said they look comfortable.  If I had a mans build and wanted them as boxers, they would be perfect."
4.0,love the ring wish that it was made from little thicker material
4.0,Nice piece for price . The only thing is the chain is not as silver as the pendant. I had to switch it. It likes almost black other than that lols good with all necklines and outfits
4.0,"These are adorable underwear if you are tiny. These were even smaller than i imagined. I bought them for my charity so I don't know how they fit on, but are well made, luckily we needed smaller sizes so they'll still get sent out to people but they are for an xxs-xs person."
4.0,I just send them back twice because they were too small otherwise once you get the right size they're great obstacle racing shoes
4.0,"Love the vibrant color and knitting pattern! This cardigan looks better than the picture. Comfortable, thick yarn material to keep me warm and cozy. I gave a four star because the threads for a few of the buttons came a bit loose - I will need to sew it in. The way the pocket is sewn, there’s extra materials from the pocket that sticks out - I will also need to sew it in. Minor problems for me since I have a sewing kit, but might not be worth the trouble for others"
4.0,"Very pretty, perfect size, great quality earrings. They were also a great price. The only reason I gave them 4 stars, was that the first time I tried to open them I had a really hard time. After that no problem. Love them."
4.0,"They didn't offer for DD, so this is as close as I could get."
4.0,The wallet is not as red as the picture (it’s more “burn” red to call it in some way) but let’s be fair.... For the price... IT’S WAY TOO AMAZING and great every cm!<br />Perfect for 10 cards and I even have two photos in!
4.0,"I wasn't expecting them to be plastic for the price (probably should have read the description better), but they're fine sunglasses."
4.0,Met my expectation.
4.0,"I had no problem wearing this to my kickboxing class the other day.  I felt sufficiently ""covered"" but breezy at the same time.  As a mom of 2 large boys my tummy will never be on free display again but this makes it possible to have the best of both worlds ;)"
4.0,"They are actually slightly bigger than I thought they would be, but it just allows for them to be better shown off! I have gotten several compliments on them. They are comfortable and lightweight. They feel so dainty, I keep expecting them to just kind of break, but so far so good. The only real downside is that if you have thin cartilage, the earrings don't stay in position consistently. Other than that, I love them. They are elegant and original."
4.0,"I got them in a couple days. They were packaged well. There was a nice case, a small screwdriver keychain for repairs. The glasses fit me well. I got  compliments the one time I wore them. I had no problem with the product but my eyes are a light blue and the lenses were just too dark for me. I have no pigment in my eyes so I need a lighter lens. The lens looks light when you look at them but when you put them on they are a dark grey. The definition was good. The glasses were quite nice for the price. Just too dark for me."
4.0,This is a quality dress shirt but runs large in size. XLT was like an XXLT so I recommend ordering a size down from your norm.
4.0,"Love the top, its extremely Cute and fits well! But, the bottoms are not what we expected! They dont cover but half the back and have ruching in the back."
4.0,"I wish I would have purchased it one size larger, but I do wear it and it certainly keeps me warm when I wear it, so I am good to go!"
4.0,"I like this though its a little on the cheesy side and took forever to get here from China. Months. I worry about the poor people making these though considering the price- a few of the metal rings were off on the bracelet- like someone got to the 400th one they made that day and just couldn't even see straight? Anyway, if you want to wait and your conscience can stand it (everyone needs a job) I think its well worth the money and good looking enough and will match with other turquoise jewelry you might have- though the stones are probably not actual turquoise but dyed and have a faint seam in the middle."
4.0,"These were really cute and really provided nice protection from the sun, but they broke the 2nd time I put them on my face...as in literally just broke off in my hand as I was putting them on. So sad because I really liked them. Would not suggest to purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE: After my review, the seller contacted me to find out more details about the problem with the sunglasses and asked for photos. Unfortunately I had not thought of taking photos and had thrown the broken sunglasses away already. They kindly still offered to replace them at a discounted price and assured me all products were inspected before shipment and perhaps these had been damaged in the shipping process. I really did like the sunglasse - the lenses were so clear - so I am going to order again. Give them a try. They are really great for the price. Great customer service too."
4.0,Nice quality exactly what I was looking for
4.0,I love this dress! Beautiful on and fits as expected. Great work dress.
4.0,I really love this skirt! It came in a nice bag and was not wrinkled. My only issue is that it runs a little small so I am glad I ordered up a size! It fits perfectly with the larger size.
4.0,"Very pretty accent necklace. Way bigger than I realized. I think this necklace would go nicely with a white tank and an oversized cardigan. It's just one length, but in pic #1 I tied it up in the back. Pic #2 is the actual length. Not adjustable per say, but you could easily shorten it with a safety pin of hair tie. It's very shiny and I like the coin design."
4.0,My likes on these brand of socks are comfort my toes dont feel weird having material between them until i try to squeeze them into shoes so for me these are house wear only<br />Dislikes would have to be cost for quantity
4.0,"I love the fabric of these Max Studio tops! The body is waaay loose though, so I ordered XS when I'm really L. The colour is a bit drab, so I've been having a ball dyeing them in various colours. They look amazing. I have at least 10!👍"
4.0,Nice! I’m using it as a dental technician and it’s great for wax drips and hot metal splashed. I did re-configure the straps somewhat to have one loop around the neck and one across the back.  Maybe a similar design could be manufactured in the future.
4.0,OK for the price.  The fabric has a bit more stretch than I like but it feels nice. No itchy places and the neck doesn't bind.
4.0,"I really like the stripes on the sleeves, and that makes the sweater a little more unique. The stitches are a larger gauge, so layering it with a shirt underneath is a good option."
4.0,"Great, looks very nice. Fits large wrist too"
4.0,Fits well and quality look.
4.0,Larger than I thought it would be but it's comfy and 100% cotton. It's waffle knit cotton not real thick but nice around the house in winter. Unfortunately it also is very attracted to my dog's fur (keeshond) and is constantly covered in it. My other cotton clothing doesn't have this issue.
4.0,I like this belt. A big improvement over old army belt. Very durable.
4.0,I couldn't find something similar in a woman's cut so I went with this. The shoulders are definitely for a man but other than that it is sooooooo comfortable. It's thick enough to keep the chill away but not enough to make you hot. It's a little thin when it comes to wind but if you layer it won't be a problem. The reason I gave it four stars is I've only had it a month and there a few spots where holes are starting to form near the pockets.
4.0,"You can adjust the size on these, but if you have smaller wrists they are still going to be too big. They are pretty though."
4.0,"A review stated that they were too big for a small face. I have a pretty big face, so I ordered them. They turned out to be too wide for my face too. I was able to adjust them with a little hand tool intervention and they fit better. The quality is much better than I expected. They are definitely not flimsy. For the price, these are a good purchase. I would buy them again."
4.0,"Solid bibs. I'm on the tall side at 6'4"" with long legs and I'm happily surprised by their length. They feel kind of form fitting in the lower thigh before the bottoms somewhat flare out. Other than that they are on the lighter side and are averagely warm. Pretty durable with only some wear, but they have about 60+ days on them now. So, they're holding up in the Utah conditions."
4.0,"Bought for my granddaughter.  1st day worn, the buttons fell off.  I had to sew them back on.  Otherwise they were really nice boots."
4.0,Sadly came broken so I had to return - but it was very pretty.
4.0,"Bought these in a 4.5 for my then 9yo daughter. These were stylish and comfortable. The laces were a little tough to manipulate easily as she had to loosen them a lot to put them on and then needed some help to retighten and tie well (stiff round laces), but they were supportive and firm without being restrictive. I personally LOVED the look of these and the fact that no one else had anything like them. I also liked the gray color (we got gray with white swoosh and laces). White shows all the scuffs and everyone has black so if your kiddo is like mine and tosses her shoes near the bench or in the locker room after a game, they blend in with all the other kiddos' shoes. We were sad when she outgrew them this season but I'm saving them for my now 6yo to grow into!"
4.0,"As someone with no hair, if they were thicker they would be perfect."
4.0,The style is great as is the quality!  Unfortunately the lens are a little large for me.
4.0,"This keychain was to be a gift for a young Volvo enthusiast (23 y.o., young to me). The fact that the logo/fob is 3-D & reversed on its dorsal side AND came in its own small box to wrap were strong selling points when compared to my other options. When it arrived, the aforementioned small box was damaged to the point of not being usable (not a major issue & was able to be ""worked around""). However, the keychain was essentially CRUSHED(!?) & I needed to repair it before presentation to my young friend. The item's quality was as expected, the only real problem was the damage, which was not only repairable, but I was able to improve its appearance & durability."
4.0,"It works; it's stainless, it's just fine."
4.0,cute but a lot of them have some black spots on the paws :(
4.0,Was made a little smaller than expected
4.0,You do not need to size up. I did and I should of ordered a small. The medium is too big. Just stay true to your size.
4.0,The stones are tiny but I got them for an 8 year old so I think they'll be great. I'll know more after Christmas.
4.0,"These are ""louder"" than the shorts I normally wear, but they looked super cute on the model and I decided to give 'em a go.  I normally wear a 16 or 18 depending on how they're made, so I got the ""Large Plus"" and they fit great and look nice too!<br /><br />They're just loose fitting, lightweight shorts with very little stretch (the fabric almost feels like a heavier chiffon). They launder great and have not shrunk or faded.  Super cute, I'm probably going to get another pair in another print!  :)"
4.0,My 2 year loves them but they are a little big! Hopefully they will fit better next year.
4.0,Not made all that well. I have already stuck my fingers through the side seam ??? But they fit well.
4.0,"The photos are deceiving they make this sling look larger than it is. The human in their photo must be a small person. Other than it's size, the product seems to be constructed well and will meet my needs when I travel. I did swap out the pull cords with bright yellow paracord."
4.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE! This is roomier than I thought. Took a little longer to get here but absolutely worth it!
4.0,This fit almost perfectly. I’m 5’7 270lbs and it fit great except the upper arms were a little tight.
4.0,"Design is cute. Little bit bigger than my size, it's ok.  I ordered White, but not really white. That is only I don't like it."
4.0,I like these socks. However some of the threading is already coming apart in the designs such as on the black parts of the socks.
4.0,"I normally wear a size xsmall or small in tops but this sweater was just too cute to pass up. I received a size medium and though it fit a little bigger on me, I love it! It works since that’s the trend right now anyway. It is a very soft and warm sweater. I haven’t had to wash it yet, but it seems like it should be fine. Great addition to my closet!"
4.0,They are much larger than they appear on Line but I was still pleasantly surprised at how beautiful they were. My daughter is a pageant girl so they are being used as gifts for the pageant sashes.
4.0,"This is a very well made tray to keep on your dresser.  It appears very well made and finished on all sides including the bottom.  It comes in a very nice box and would be a good gift for anyone that needs a little organization.  The area for the phone is a good size and can accommodate larger devices at 4-3/8"" by 8-3/4""."
4.0,I really like the purse and the bottom is hard so it sits really well and looks great. Some of the stitching is coming apart but for the price it's a pretty good buy. Would've given it a 4.5 if I could
4.0,I bought these for my boyfriend they looked great on. But the A is a bit off center on one of them. He didn't notice it and the event was that day. He has worn them twice since I purchased them. He did say he wished they came in black so they looked sharper.
4.0,This dress is really pretty but I returned it because it was a bit too long on me. I'm 5'2 135lbs and I got a medium. Medium normally fits perfect but this was a little big
4.0,"These are well made and a good value.  I do like the length of them.  At my age, not a midriff shower!  There is a comfortable shelf bra containing the pads.<br /><br />I do have a few issues, though.  They run large.  I am a straight up medium in a sports bra but I have gapping at the base of straps and material is too loose for a sports bra.  Size small may have made a difference for me, so I’d suggest sizing down.  I have a short torso as well.  The material is more like a tech workout shirt, 85% polyester and 15% elastane.  No spandex, so no compression. So, i will probably wear these as a gym tank with tights or in Summer with bike shorts vs. under gymwear."
4.0,"Fit but is just a bit too high up for me. Too much belly, but for the price, I haven't gotten any complaints."
4.0,"This is a very good looking pair of spenders and appears well made. It fits me very well (I'm 5'10"" 240 lbs). Because it's a one-size-fits-all, the tails of the straps hang down pretty far and I wish there was a way to secure them. But the big problem is there is no elastic in the back strap so there is no give in the suspenders. But all-in-all I'm pleased with this purchase."
4.0,"Size, color, weight all are great!<br />Leather is so soft.<br />Plenty of compartments to keep organized.<br />Im am very pleased!"
4.0,"Cheap, costume prop, so I am not worried about having to replace it some day. It works for what I needed ito for."
4.0,Love these but one of the sets came broken :(
4.0,Very comfortable. I like the padded heal. Fit just right.
4.0,I order the black but received the stripe one. Other than that it fit just right.
4.0,Love these!! The hearts are a little more rounded than shown in the picture but overall great glasses!
4.0,"I have a protective screen glass on my watch face. However, I do like having this silicone sleeve on my watch face too. I bumped my watch all the time and I finally feel like it's extra protected. I would buy this again. I wish they came in different colors for my watch."
4.0,Nice material. Mostly lounging around in
4.0,Cute..fit
4.0,I would give it 5 stars if it was true to the movie. I really don't understand how this is the official cousin Eddie hat but yet its the wrong color. I've seen the film 100 times and its green &#34;fur&#34; with dark green &#34;leather&#34;. That being said its the closest thing I found after hours and hours of searching. I will say though that nobody noticed the difference and the costume was a huge hit. I even was getting thumbs up by passing cars as we walked to the party. Oh you want to know how to make the sides stay flapped up like Eddies in the movie? Our quick solution worked like a champ and nobody knew. Take small paper clamps and clip on the inside towards the back...bamm...you are cousin Eddie. https://www.amazon.com/ACCO-BRANDS-72020-Binder-Silver/dp/B00N3CC1CC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476744922&sr=8-1&keywords=small+paper+clamp
4.0,Package arrived faster than expected so that was nice!<br />For being a sweatshirt the fabric is very thin.  Size was okay...I ordered a L for my daughter who wears a small because she likes sweatshirts that are baggy.  The design is pretty and I haven't washed it yet so I can't say for sure how it will hold up.  I may come back and update.<br />My daughter was thrilled to get it as BTS is one of her favorite groups and she has been asking for some Kpop merch for ages.  She has no complaints.  😉
4.0,"Hanes hit a home run with these boxers.  The are snug enough to keep Mr Fun from wandering too far, but loose enough to give everyone a chance to breath and live in comfort in the Southern hemisphere."
4.0,"Lovely dress, wore to function party,got lots of complements<br />The one down side is it has a bulge in the back"
4.0,Very cute on my 5 year old
4.0,"Given that I got this at a fraction of the price of some of the more popular fitness wear I think it’s super cute, fits well and is decent quality- I will buy more in different colors!"
4.0,Get lots of compliments when I wear it.
4.0,"I love handcrafted items, and this is so cute, however it looks like it’s more for a child because the chain is really short."
4.0,"So I like the rings a lot. I bought for my hubby because he welds and metal rings are just not safe to wear. So after about two months the ring started separating. It’s kind of folded on itself and has come undone. But the good part is I have two more rings that came with it. So I would say, all in all it’s a good buy. My husband has a very physical demanding and rough job so I didn’t expect them to be perfect. Good for the price and under most circumstances I feel, they are sturdy enough and have decent quality."
4.0,It's sometimes takes a littler effort to put the shoe on but it looks cute and worth the hassle.
4.0,"I do love this wallet.  Just wish it wasn't so mini.  I would like to be able to put bills/change in the zippered area, but the bills sometimes get stuck in the zipper when I am trying to retrieve them.  I would love to see a bifold aspect to this item which would double the number of slits and also provide more opportunity to store bills/change more safely in the zippered area."
4.0,"my 12 year old daughter likes this kind of outfit from  Anime  she watches i got her XXL due to size is in Asian size my suprse the top was little big but as described hade the letters on back, now the bottom still to tight in legs I went up 2 size to be on save side imdown fall is that has to be dry eating only dye to the fabric it will shred in a regular washer just in FYI on that part"
4.0,These are comfy. Not tight though. Kinda loose. Fits the length and width of my foot. Just a bit loose on top of foot
4.0,"This very inexpensive product wears out sooner than I expected, with fraying of the terrycloth uppers and breaches in the rubber soles. However, I still really like these, so I will simply replace them more frequently. I bought them because I'm new California resident: we are supposed to always have safe shoes to walk over glass after an earthquake, so I have them in every room. But I began using them every day as slippers."
4.0,"1st off...these are not boy shorts, they are more like hipsters. They still fit nice and are good to workout in, but I would have liked more of a &#34;leg&#34;.<br />The patterns are just OK...I got a lot of pink - which I do not care for...but not a deal breaker. The waistband is rather thin and snug, but not painful or irritating. All in all they are good for my intended purpose of workout undies and only wearing them for a couple hours at a time."
4.0,"its super cute and not small in size but just way shorter than we expected.  seems like good fabric, we will keep it and pass it along to a short friend because it is adorable."
4.0,The color of the frames. Would have like a different color lens.
4.0,"they are Adorable, warm and were comfy but the bottoms break down very easy. I don't think I would purchase again."
4.0,"Got these for 15 with shipping and handling when they arrived one glove doesn't work at all the other has two dead lights on it, very disappointed. seeing five stars I was expecting something that would work. I was going to use these for an event on the 30th. Hoping for a refund or a reshipment please get back to me.was re shipped new ones in working condition made it through my event. They are not very durable tho seeing as after the event one finger isn't working. But it made the event btw parents this is not for kids ffs these are hella bright LEDs for kids eyes"
4.0,"I expected cheap Chinese sunglasses. Surprisingly, they are fairly well built. They were purchased as &#34;leave them in the car&#34; sunglasses. I will probably buy a second pair for our other car. The only part of this deal that is cheap feeling, is the hard case.<br />Follow-up: I was able to field test them on a drive out of town today. In both cloudy and various degrees of sunshine......wow. I have a pair of RBs and these look just as good. They really cut through haze and early morning fog. My eyes are definitely not fatigued. I had to make some minor adjustments to the temples, but I also had the RBs fitted. 1/10th the cost. Btw, I'm not a paid or gifted reviewer."
4.0,Got this for my birthday outing. Got a lot of compliments! 1 less star because the boob part was a little small for someone that’s busty like me but it was still a hit
4.0,"This shirt is super cute.  I love the phrase and the colors.  However, it runs really big.  I normally wear a medium and that is what I ordered but it's basically a large.  It's baggy on me and is a whole size too big.  I should have returned it and re-ordered a small but I'll just give it keep it and probably order another one in a small.<br />Btw another plus is the fabric of this shirt does not shrink which I love but just need to order a size smaller."
4.0,"not at all what I expected- much much smaller.  That said, it looks well made and I can use it.  Note:  This is NOT large enough to carry even a small laptop."
4.0,Just as described. Fits good.
4.0,"Little small, but I like it!"
4.0,"I like the size and the quality it is so soft. I wish it was a bit marriageable, it sounds too loose, sees where do you want to wear it...."
4.0,"I bought this along with a group of small things to send as part of a care package for a friend who needed a pick me up.  Needless to say, I ordered about 20 inexpensive but nice things on October 17th and this arrived on November 2nd.  It is nice and worth the price, but if time is a factor, look for a vendor that isn't in a different country."
4.0,Received masks in one day...they are really good quality and very soft.
4.0,"Stones are not as bright and vibrant as picture. True to size. Nice, comfortable fit and good backings and posts."
4.0,"It's hard to find a skort that fits me since I'm 5'7"" and 107lb. I ordered size xs and it fits like dream.  Definately go up a size or two if you have curvy body."
4.0,"Love, love, love this clicker it's so cute and unique and I get tons of compliments! Only problem I had was that the fist couple of times you wear it it's SUPER hard to click into place and even harder to remove with out hurting."
4.0,Love the print and the style.
4.0,I like these pants they're nice enough to sleep in.
4.0,My daughter selected these shoes to wear to church this year. It is becoming increasingly difficult to source formal shoes for little girls.<br />She enjoys them and finds them comfortable. We have only had them a few weeks so I can't speak to durability. The clean well and easily though with a baby wipe. No complaints.
4.0,I like this product cuz it fits well and does as expected. Not a complete five Star from me at this point but that might be due to my need to decrease my body mass.
4.0,"I love the look of these! I haven’t had them out in damp weather (summer drought here) but they seem like they would be water resistant at least & possibly waterproof. Zipper on the side for easy on/off. Faux leather laces. The lining is a cozy synthetic flannel. It feels very snuggly! The down side is that these have ZERO arch support and the soles are inflexible. Not an issue if you’re just wearing them to retrieve the morning newspaper in the wet, but if you plan on walking for hours this might not be the sure for you."
4.0,"The XXL was still a bit snug. I wear a 12/14 us size. It's cute, so I gave to my sister who is a 10/12."
4.0,"I use these readers for everything, I can see close up and faraway better with them. I probably need bifocals but these seem to work. I really like the no frame look because it don’t look so “glassy!” They fit well and go with everything!"
4.0,The color of actual band matches the blue in the photo and was as expected which was nice as on other similar products the colors displayed online didn't quite match what I got.
4.0,This band replaced a traditional band and it is easier to use and doesn’t loosen up at all during the time I wear it
4.0,"The wallet is awesome but. After a month of use if you place a couple of cards one might fell off, easily without noticing. And that what happened to me, i almost lose my driving license for that. However, preventing this fromfrom happening by filling it up. Or i dunno, maybe by replacing the red grip inside!! Otherwise, it is awesome, neat and do the job perfectly."
4.0,Good elastic and clasps.  My only complaint is that the straps are a little long for a 5 foot 9 inch person to provide maximum effectiveness.
4.0,"Beautiful necklace, but faded quickly"
4.0,Great quality. Bought it a month ago and have been wearing it since.  I don’t even take it off when I workout or shower and it doesn’t get in the way.  Definitely recommend.
4.0,It's a straight woven tube with unfinished ends. The edges do tend to curl with wearing. Fits well enough. The graphics are sharp.
4.0,Love this belt. Wear with tunics and dressed. Cute boho look.
4.0,Nice shirt for golf.  Fit perfectly
4.0,You better wear a nude bra and go nowhere near water! It’s ok but super transparent.
4.0,"For the price you are getting a nice accessory to your outfit. It is just that the gold is not real gold, so if you wear a gold watch, or something with real gold, you can tell the difference."
4.0,more roomy than expected but very pretty.
4.0,The customer service was great.  The jewelry was packaged well to protect it.  I appreciate that kind of service very much.
4.0,"Great quality but I'm not sure if my head is big, or the hat is small... But I do like it a lot!"
4.0,Nice fit. Comfortable and breathable!
4.0,I haven't used it yet but it seems that it will fit what I need
4.0,They were a bit too big in size but are very comfortable to wear
4.0,"I’m only giving it the four starts because, the chain is nice and the pendant is very nice. The pendant is not like the the picture showed but for me I like the one I got better. The pendant was not on the chain and so I had to remove the little round right at the end to put it together, but all in all it’s I very nice necklace."
4.0,"Good product,would buy again.Thanks.."
4.0,Very cute. Looks just like the picture. But be warned it is big. It falls down my arm almost to my elbow.
4.0,This is a short sleeve sweater dress. It's a looser fit dress than what I am use to wearing. It's kinda like an A-Line style but more baggier.Surprisingly  the material is not itchy at all. The sweater dress was actually very comfortable and stylish  to wear.
4.0,"just what i wanted. it lays flat on my wrist, no unwanted functions to put up with or to bulk up the watch. it has a couple of functions i don't use, but basically it is a WATCH."
4.0,And ok purse.
4.0,"I love this jacket. I'm 5'8&#34;, 160, with long arms and I am shocked at how awesome long the arms are. It is so comfy, and looks good!"
4.0,A bit more see through then anticipated! It is completely sheer! But nice shirt.
4.0,A wardrobe staple for every woman. You can mix and match this blazer with any number of outfits and look great for an interview or look great at work or even for the evening when you wear over jeans.
4.0,A little smaller than the picture but ok
4.0,"came from quite a distance, so I understand why it took a couple weeks. But I receive them today, & I am so excited! They look amazing! All the colors are very accurate, and the silicon a strong and durable. Thank you so much for the product."
4.0,"This is a good quality sweater that I wear frequently, but my only problem is the length.  Due to the split hem, it rides up more than I would like.  If the side hems were not split, the length would be perfect.  The product image does not show the side view, but the split is approximately 3 inches."
4.0,Great little key holder. A little tough to get in my ring at first but it keeps my keys from jangling on my lanyard and makes the right key easy to find
4.0,Bought as gift and the person really liked the feel and fit(not too long on a petite body).
4.0,It's a little bit shorter than on the picture
4.0,Muy útiles!
4.0,Much too small for the price.  Difficult to tell just what the charm is.
4.0,well made...........like the material..... was very comfortable to wear.....sizing was perfect.
4.0,"Loved it and more cheaper but a little soft and easy to comes out, but loved it👍👍👍"
4.0,"Perfect, Great Item"
4.0,"The product I received was no where near a  long sleeve dress...  the sleeve length came to my elbows and the torso length just barely covered my gluteus maximums lol I'm 5'7&#34; with a J-Lo -like physique.  I definitely couldn't wear it as dress,  but this is fine with me.  I actually still like the shirt even though it was not accurately depicted in the picture.  I love the color.  it's my favorite color against my skin tone so still worth the purchase."
4.0,"The are a little flashier than expected, but light and comfortable"
4.0,These are very nice boots. I just wish they would carry a size 11 US in women's.
4.0,A little large. Not for petite girls. Thinner.
4.0,"I really do love these earrings and I wear them often. However, when I took them out of the package, they fell apart."
4.0,The item was a little smaller than I expected based on the picture but it was still a nice piece and a very nice accessory to my wife's costume she liked it a lot
4.0,"My husband works at home, so aside from having to attend a funeral, wedding or special work event,  he only wears a tie occasionally.  For months now, he's only had one tie to cover all of those events and not long ago, his one and only tie was demolished in the washing machine by the agitator. lol.<br /><br />Recently, he had to appear in court to testify in a trial involving a family member.  We had plenty of advance notice of the trial so when the 2 pack of the Awesome 360 Men's classic tie appeared in my Vine account, the timing was perfect!<br /><br />One of the two ties pictured in the photo above (directly from Awesome 360's Amazon page) was in the box-the pink and silver striped tie.  The solid blue tie in the same photo was not included in his 2 pack. Instead, he received a VERY nice blue/violet checkered tie. Both ties are VERY nice and both match a variety of shirts that he already owns.  On the first day of court, he wore the blue/violet checkered tie and it looked wonderful!  He wasn't happy when he learned he'd have to return for a second day and quite honestly, he was not looking forward to wearing the pink and silver tie. (He refers to it as 'pink', I think its more of a  'magenta' shade)  The silver stripes on this tie shimmer a bit.  At first he said he thought he looked like the ""Gooe Humour ice cream man"" (don't ask...I have NO clue where he got that from! lol) but he actually got some compliments on the tie and he ended up  liking it!  And it looked VERY nice!<br /><br />Both ties are nice and go so well with a variety of colored shirts.  Both wore well and were easy to tie without issue.  These ties are very nice and a good value for the price.  (After losing his other tie to the washing machine agitator, I hand washed both of these and they did very well!)"
4.0,The chain looks nice.
4.0,"I purchased this coat as I wanted something that would cover my legs. I bought the black, medium size. I am 5'8, 150 pounds. I could have gotten away with the small I believe, as the medium is roomy, but that could also be the bulk of the coat shape. The coat is long, heavy, and does give warmth. If you are looking for a tiny packable jacket this is NOT what you want. I haven't tested this in rain/sleet/snow, but it does fine below 32F. I think another reviewer said this coat is like a huge sleeping bag, it is indeed long and puffy. Other jackets like North Face or Columbia have better structure, but this was cheaper. Probably a best jacket for city things, nothing like skiiing or hiking or anything with a lot of activity.<br /><br />I am giving it 4 stars because of the bottom of the coat. It does not zip all the way to the very end of the jacket. It stops within a few inches, I'm assuming for flexibility and to let the wearer move better. Instead of a zipper there are buttons that you can snap to the very bottom. I choose to have the buttons undone, but encounter an annoying problem. If there is any breeze that makes the flaps move while you are walking, they get stuck between my legs, by my knees every other step. Going up stairs is the same, it's a constant flap that gets in the way. Having it buttoned would solve the problem but then you compromise for ease of walking (instead waddling).<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'm the only one who seems to have this weird issue, it could be my height or the way I'm walking maybe.<br /><br />Bottom line is yes I would recommend, has all the typical stuff you want such as fleece pockets, a cinch for the hood, detachable hood, and fabric in the cuffs."
4.0,"I ordered my normal 7.5 size which can, at times, be too big with the heel slipping. These fit tight enough that there is no slipping at the heel.  They do feel snug in the toes and length and I'm hoping they will not hurt after a few hours, but I decided to keep based on the nice red color. I think they will go well with jeans or ankle length dress pants."
4.0,"Im afraid ,it changed colors on me before I have gotten yo enjoy it."
4.0,Fit as expected - it is quite thin needing a tank top underneath . i  have gotten many compliments on this shirt when I wear it.
4.0,My daughter is very pleased!
4.0,Replacement pairs are good
4.0,"I would have rated this shirt five stars but the fit was not as expected.  The shirts run a size small.  Otherwise, everything else was a great buy."
4.0,"I agree that the material is windproof, and it is very warm! I was comfortable on a sunny, sub 20 degree F day. But for me anything warmer would make my head too hot while mountain biking. I’d have to use my old hat that isn’t windproof. The coverage of this beanie is great, and it keeps my ears warm (compared to my other hats  that barely cover my ears). Also, the material isn’t too thick, so I just had to loosen my helmet just a little for it to fit. However, the material isn’t very stretchy and there isn’t much elastic around the edges. So the fit on my head, which I think is about average as I have size medium helmets, isa little too loose for my liking."
4.0,"Very comfortable sports bra. My only dislike is the size. I wear a 36C and bought the large size & it felt a bit small.  I still wear it, a little side boob can be hidden as long as I wear a T-shirt."
4.0,"Cute but run a little small. The lace tears pretty easily and I've already had to repair toe seams, however I am probably wearing them more than the average person (I don't like to wear socks with my low cut slip on shoes, but if I don't the shoes get stinky. So I wear a pair of these daily.)"
4.0,Comfortable and easy to wear. Added with a belt for accent touch
4.0,"Really liked the phone case it was cute the color was cute the first day. then the next day came and it was already dirty. Didn’t like that at all, but theres a reason why I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 3, I dropped my phone on a big rock facefront and nothing happen to my phone. So this case and the screen protector they send does acutally protector your phone really well!!"
4.0,This band is a thicker fabric so I don’t like to wear it when I workout but it’s stretchy and non irritating! No snags yet!
4.0,I have had lots of compliments on this ring.  Looks like it does in the picture and is true to size.  Because I wear it all the time it is losing its fresh gold color on the bottom but I expected that to happen.
4.0,Smaller than expected but I am making it work
4.0,Not my favorite house slippers but they are well made at least. I just didn't personally find them very comfortable.
4.0,"The quality is pretty decent, but nothing special. I’m a little disappointed with the sizing. They don’t have an xs so I expected the small the be a little smaller. I really wish they had an xs, the small is way too loose although it’s definitely a low impact bra even if it is the correct size. The material is pretty soft, the padding is pretty firm for my liking but fortunately it’s removable."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. So beautiful that I was excited, until I went to put it on my daughter. This dress was only a tiny bit bigger that the 7/8 size I had bought for me niece. No labels to verify size so maybe the wrong size was sent. A shame though, it really is a beautiful dress."
4.0,"Sizing runs small, but the seller indicated that in the listing.  I bought one size bigger, and it fit well.  The torso length is shorter than I wish, but it fits.  The shirt quality is good."
4.0,"Was pretty sad this didn't fit better, as it would really be perfect for hiking and boating.  Might fit the average person, but the sleeves were a smidge too long for petite arms.  Still recommend if you're looking for a UPF shirt with wind protection!"
4.0,nice fluffy gloves but not -30 degree gloves about 2 minutes into my ride to work my hands were cold
4.0,Very nice and chick !!
4.0,It is just what he asked for!  Very good quality made!
4.0,This is the second one I bought. Good vale for the money
4.0,I should order a xlarge.the 2x fits me very big.apart from that.it's nice..
4.0,"The navy seem to fit a bit differently than my black pair.  They are not quite as tight and when I stretch them to put them on I hear threads ripping but I do not find any split or splitting seams or stray threads.  The color is a dusty dark blue....  not really a deep dark blue.  They still are good pants, but not GREAT like the black pair I bought."
4.0,"Pretty good, breathable jersey. Holding up strong."
4.0,"I’m 5’5” 240. Bought the 3X and it fits very loose and flowy, which is what I was after. Great shape, although the print isn’t as crisply defined as I’d like. Still cute. Good for casual wear."
4.0,Prefect for the summer really cool and lite weight
4.0,"I want to give like a 2 star because it's so small I can't were it. Hope to receive a bigger one. 4 stars because it so beautiful and oh my gosh silky soft. Very stretchy, skin tight :("
4.0,The material in these socks was soft and stretchy but too tight for me so I had to return them.
4.0,Really nice especially for the price. Live the color.
4.0,I can usually always be safe with a large as my chest is busty but this large BARELY buttons at the top button.  I love the look though and I will probably leave the last button undone as to not look like Homer Simpson lol.  Cute for the price.
4.0,"I don’t know much about ties, I bought this for my fianc&eacute; to wear for our wedding... he said it’s of good quality, so for the price, it’s a winner!"
4.0,This was a gift and they really liked it.
4.0,"Cute, true to size ordered 4t and it fit like a 4t. Fabric is thin but fine cause its summer!"
4.0,"The watch looked nice when I first saw it, but I'd never had the chance to see it work because it was a gift for a friend. However the bracelet and the metal structure were beautiful, simple but beautiful, that's why I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,Worked well touching ship wrecks and corral. Tough material should last awhile. Well worth the money.
4.0,"These are great for the day. Not sure if I didn't read well, but they sing work at night. Got to get another pair of glasses specifically for driving at night."
4.0,"This sweater became available toward the end of winter, so I got it in a larger size than I normally would have to ensure that it will still fit my eight-year-old granddaughter next winter. It does seem to run a bit large for its size range, however.<br /><br />The sweater is in a bright and bold red check pattern in the classic crew neck pullover style.<br />The stitching is done well, and the pattern is aligned where it meets the ribbed neck and cuffs.<br />Although it is made from synthetic fibers, the sweater is very soft. It is also very warm, because synthetics do not ""breathe"" like natural ones do.<br /><br />The sweater is made of Acrylic: 47%, Nylon: 28% and Polyester: 25%. It is machine washable, but wash it separately the first few times: I'm not certain that it is colorfast.<br />I strongly recommend drying the sweater flat to minimize ""pilling"" of the synthetic fibers.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the sweater seems to run a bit large for its given sizes, but I suggest buying it in your child's usual size. It is better for a sweater to be a bit too roomy than to be too small."
4.0,The size I ordered initially  was too big. Re-ordered a smaller size and it fit perfect. It looked prettier than I expected Considering the Price. I was happy so i'll recommend it.
4.0,Bought for personal use but heavier than expected.
4.0,"After a lot of steaming and re-steaming , this dress is actually quite beautiful! I wore it to work with a tank top under and it looked very nice. I’m 5.3, 125 and the smallest size fits a tad loose in the middle and top , But I just wore a tank under and it still looked good. Can be worn multi ways, surprisingly washed well. Just make sure you have a way to remove the hard wrinkles that it comes with"
4.0,The only problem with this suit is the straps. They are not sewn on and come off sometimes.
4.0,"i loved it but from the neck i think i will get a rash because of the glittered material, it fit perfect!"
4.0,Very pretty.  Good transaction
4.0,"Exactly what I hoped it would be, for the price I paid. Not exceptional quality (of course not) but great to party and have fun in. When I first opened the package it looked like it would be that very cheap dark dirty gold usually found on costume jewelry, but when I pulled it out I was pleasantly surprised it was actually a very bright and glittery gold that reflected lots of shine.<br />It was a very small adjustable link around the waist, but it is meant for smaller sizes, it only adjusts about an inch.<br /><br />It actually broke while I was wearing it out, one of the links opened when I bent over, but the next day I easily fixed it and pinched the link back together. I did not deduct any stars for this, bc this is a very low-priced piece and I did not expect the best quality. The fact I could easily fix it with no tools makes it still worthwhile in my book.<br /><br />I'm 115 lb and a size Small, it fits great, but in certain positions, like leaning over, I felt some strain against it."
4.0,Love this item. Looks really good on me and very comfy. My husband said he liked it too without me having to ask. I only gave it 4 stars because it's not excellent material it's cotton and it shrinks. But for the price you cant beat ut
4.0,Loved how the dress fit me.
4.0,"I bought this top due the the buttons. It looked easy to breastfeed in and I'm glad I got it. It's flowly hiding my pp belly and also giving me a little extra room in the top for my boobs to grow without causing a gap. Of I wouldn't of gotten this shirt for breastfeeding I would of sized down to a small. I like the material, and it's going to be super easy to layer with when it starts to get colder."
4.0,Love the design but socks don’t have stretch
4.0,"Where will your style take you today? Hop on board and let epic-ness be your destination. These look to be inspired by classic &#34;plug&#34; designs, this rad collection of three showcases gold, silver and black to bring you an elegant simplicity that's timeless yet edgy. Because there are three different colors for you to mix, match and layer pieces to create a look that is uniquely you. Next stop, fabulous! So far I have only had a few issues with these.One issue I did have is that they come in three really tiny pieces you have to screw together, I have very long nails that made this a very hard task to do. Second, the bar connecting the two ends... my hair get wrapped up in it. not a big deal it you wear or hair up, or if you are like me and just do not care and would still rather wear the earring and deal with the hair. Because they pieces are so small they will be easy to lose, they do send a cute and reasonable little bag for you to keep them safely in. they are a nice small size. Not to heavy and they send three colors to match just about any outfit. I am allergic to nickel, and have not noticed any our break yet! yeah! I would say this is a great set of earring for the teen in your life who wants plugs but you do not want them to. Heck, I'm not a teen and I love them! If you have any questions about these earring please ask! I am always on Amazon so I will get back to you as soon as I can!

4.0,lo malo fue que mi vestido salio con mangas largas y no lo pedi asi en la descripción no dice que es mangas largas pero igual sigue siendo bonito
4.0,"Ordered a 2t for my 75% (height and weight) 20 month old, the 2t fits her exact and she won't wear it after this summer. But it's so cute I'd buy it again and again."
4.0,"Very fast shipping, and my granddaughter loved them!"
4.0,Very cute hat. I can wear it in several different ways.
4.0,wife loves them. A little big in my opinion.
4.0,It's to long
4.0,Used them on a long trip from the US to Singapore. They were comfortable. I use them to prevent deep venous thrombosis on long flights. They also kept my feet warm. I recommend this brand of compression socks.
4.0,My picky husband likes it and it fits him well.  I like the look too
4.0,As I stated it was not true to size I was disappointed because it looked good loved the umbre but had I known about the sizing maybe it would have been better.
4.0,"Bought as a gag gift for a doctor post surgery. Had to iron out some wrinkles but was better quality considering a ""costume"" piece."
4.0,The shirt is soft and fits nicely ( I’m a 14- 16 top) in the large. Also covers bra straps. My disappointment is that the lettering is iron on decals so wondering how long they will stay put with repeated washing.
4.0,"This is a very nice dress, awesome design and great fit. It looks very feminine but very modern. The fabric is light and the color I bought (beige) looks awesome in person. The only two things i didn't like about this dress were the buttons in front they look a bit cheap and also, the part of the dress thar seats on the shoulders is extremely tight, i will have to alter that part in order to wear it."
4.0,Good shirt. Can be dressed up or down. Better quality than anticipated. A little more boxy than I’d have liked.
4.0,works just fine
4.0,"I bought this for my size 2 daughter and it fits a bit snug in the waist, other than that issue it's perfect for my 5'4&#34; daughter. The quality was nice enough to wear as a maid of honor dress."
4.0,"This has become a popular design in tops it seems and this one is cute.  Basic quality but I like how it fits, good length and plenty of room in the back and shoulders, a little tight for me in the chest.  It has been perfect this summer because it's lightweight and breathable.  You'll need to be careful with it because the fabric is delicate.  It's nice for the price.  I like it!"
4.0,"I’m 5’2 , 120lb 34DD I bought the kaki in Lrg. It’s a bit roomy. Covers my bum and the sleeves go all the way down. I like this kimono very much it looks like the photo. The material is a bit scratchy but not unbearable. I just bought the light blue color in a medium because I’m hoping for a more fitted look like the model in the picture and because of the arm length, hoping it hits by my elbow. I hope this helps. It’s really cute 🤗UPDATE: received the blue in medium. Doesn’t fit properly so if you have my body type stick with the Large.The sleeves might be long but it looks like the picture."
4.0,"These leggings are amazing!!  They are stretchy, kinda silky and overall just pretty amazing!  I'm always a little skeptical buying them online when I can't try them on at first but these did not disappoint!!  They have pockets in just the right places and stay put and don't sag down!  Really happy with this purchase!!"
4.0,Perfect for what I want to do with it. Take it shopping and to Royals Baseball games. It has a large spot for my Samsung S7 edge with plenty of room left over. I even have a case on my phone. It has a spot for three credit cards and loose bills. Can't really put loose change in here - there is no zipper to secure it. The strap is adjustable and extra long for larger people. The &#34;leather&#34; is a little cheap and I don't see it holding up over the years but for what you pay for it - it's pretty awesome.
4.0,Liked quality
4.0,"Pretty and soft.  My fingers are very long, so these gloves didn’t fit perfectly, but i snapped off the finger tips, and they still look cool."
4.0,"Okay, so I love the idea of this necklace but I hated the color... So I used some metallic light blue nail polish and painted the ugly yellow rose, and now I love the necklace! I recommend buying this because it's really a good piece for the price, but I would never wear it in the color it came in. So if you don't like the color, just paint it!"
4.0,I love these boots!! Super cute and comfortable. I would love all three colors!I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest reviewand I can say 100% that I will end up with another pair. They are adorable.
4.0,It didn’t fit at all and since I Thew the package away I could not return any of the outfits I brought three of them omg
4.0,"Super cute set! I do wish the hot pan holder was more insulated and thicker, though. I'm afraid it will burn my hand if I use it to hold a pot. I use mine to hold a hot plate out of the microwave vs holding a hot pan from the oven."
4.0,"I ordered the SHINY GOLD with GREEN lenses.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />-- The shiny gold with green lenses look works and while I normally opt for silver frames I am happy with stepping outside the box on these<br />-- They offer many options when it come to metal with lens color combinations<br />-- Per my Internet research, UV400 protection does provide excellent protection from UVA and UVB rays<br />-- Metal appears solid and well made with tight connections and should be durable over time with normal use<br />-- They look good and I love throwback ""retro""<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />-- Not the ideal fit for my face since I have a large head and am 6' 1/2"" tall and weigh 175 pounds. Although the width of the frames is a good fit for me so that should counteract with the fact that they are not tall enough in the lense to be an ideal fit for my face.<br />-- I have bushy thicker eyebrows but as long as I thin them out when I do my bi-monthly buzz cut they will still look pretty good. Plus a frame this narrow (not tall) is not designed to completely cover your eyebrows anyway.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I still like them quite a bit..."
4.0,"Incredible light weight, extremely comfortable"
4.0,"Slight smudging on one part, but otherwise great"
4.0,Item was as expected. Snug fit. The zippers are a little uncomfortable at the top. Have had to wrap a piece of fabric over it to keep it from rubbing the skin raw. The zipper makes it for easy off but totally impossible if you put these on unzipped and expect to zip them up. Have to pull them on like regular stockings.
4.0,"This dress was very sexy, I liked it because the back of the dress has the same material as the front. But they run very small"
4.0,"These look great and are stylish, but they are no where near oversized, almost undersized.<br /><br />They are great though, so I'll give them to the kid"
4.0,"These stay on nicely. They seem a little bigger on the top than similar brands, so the lace pokes out of my shoes more"
4.0,"Skirt is almost exactly what I was looking for, but definitely runs small. Good thing I’m focused on losing weight so I don’t feel like I’m being squished by this skirt!"
4.0,"The Cinch It does work well.  It can take a blouse that just hangs and changes the way the clothing hangs or fits.  It elevates the style of your clothing.  It can take a bit of getting used to putting on, but well worth the effort."
4.0,Watch is good looking and keeps good time. Only compliant I have is band is very stiff hope with wear it will soften.
4.0,Very comfortable but size was a little too big. Might want to size down when buying.
4.0,It’s a cute dress.. very light for summer but definitely size up.
4.0,"Maybe I have a bigger head than most but it is still baggy.  I am waiting for the other Z&S Vintage Men's Baggy Large Styles I ordered.  I prefer this closed knit vice the open knit.  Nonetheless, it is a nice cap."
4.0,"Cute, colors faded quickly though"
4.0,"The material is nice & soft. The leggings do droop down around the crotch & I have to pull them up too often. The waist is also too large for mine, it wrinkles & isnt tight. They're still nice tho, not the worst quality or buy."
4.0,"(Burgundy) These were a tad small (I'm 5'7 &amp; 160lbs) but they weren't so small that they were uncomfortable. The length was great and they were comfortable and warm but I wasn't a fan of how shimmery they looked - they looked more like stockings than leggings to me (which you really can't tell from the stock photos). I'm more of a fan of the plain cotton, non-shimmery leggings so these will not be one of my favorites.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I only review items that I need / use and will always give my honest opinion of the product."
4.0,I was looking for some postpartum leggings and these were recommended. I love them! They’re exactly what I need and they have pockets!! Perfect for going out on walks so I won’t have to carry my phone. And as it’s getting warmer but so far I’m pretty comfortable in these.
4.0,"Although it arrived late (as I was boarding my flight), there were no scratches or dents as are he right size for me and my family of five. I do look forward to using them soon! I do not anticipate any problems despite some of the reviews."
4.0,Nice earrings.  Looks to have more black in the picture than in person.
4.0,Cute but somewhat heavy.
4.0,It first looked like it was light blue not dusty blue. Center pocket is small. Pockets smallish and the two main pockets are deep and seem narrow.
4.0,The  Necklace  kept moving to the side
4.0,Nice product except for the scratching of my calves from where the elastic was put together.  Once I put tape over the melted together area it was okay.
4.0,"Love the shirt so cute, the pants are not cute or comfortable for my dtr. The pearls on the jeans are not at all cute"
4.0,"Nice, soft and comforable. I thought it would be longer."
4.0,This jacket is darling. I sized up and I did not need too. I should have ordered my normal size.  I’m still happy with my purchase. This is so cute and cozy!
4.0,"Loved this hat! I only took the one star off because I think the age range should be changed to 1-5. I tried this on my 7 year old and it didn't fit her very well. Though it fit my 1,3, and 5 year old perfectly (though the chin straps were not tight on my 1 year old, but a quick fix was to loosely tie them together then Velcro it, which worked great). The chin straps were soft and none of the kids complained about them, which is a win in my books."
4.0,"This dress is cool.  The top doesnt stay off the shoulder, i have to fold it down continuously. Its seethrough. This is a great drsss, but not for me because it shows my shapewear."
4.0,I ordered the blue in XL and my size is a 16. It fit as expected and loved the color. It's hard to tell which is the front or back though
4.0,"This garment didn't shrink in the washer/dryer as I had anticipated, it's still cute, but order a size smaller"
4.0,"Nicely made, fit to size but NOT color as shown. Expecting the teal/aqua that is shown but received in mint green."
4.0,Good quality but from China Order a couple sizes bigger than you normally would.
4.0,Pretty earrings.  Pearls are very good quality - they are a little bit grey (I prefer more of a peacock color).  Great buy overall :)
4.0,Need a firmer material for the tummy area.
4.0,Comfortable. Toddler loved them
4.0,"[[ASIN:B01IBATQK0 Delebao Baby Girl Infant Baptism Dance Ballerina Slippers with Bow Ribbon (0-6 Months, Shoes)]]<br /><br />These shoes were for our daughter to wear for her baptism. They fit just fine and looked great. She only had to wear the through mass and then back home so maybe for two hours. I can't imagine that they provide great arch support but then again most shoes for kids in this age range don't simply because it isn't needed. They don't walk yet anyway so they save the money and materials by not adding all that extra in and that's fine with me because again she's not walking and she's only wearing them for a short bit anyway."
4.0,"I ordered these to be able to use in the cool weather.  They are like slippers for outside, I do not use them for extensive walking.  They seem like a great option to run out and get the paper or take the kid to school for 10 minutes. I think they may grow on me but this is how I use it for now. The only regret I have is that there is no buckle or zipper of any kind, thus I have to pull them on."
4.0,"It's nice but be sure you use it on a larger sized watch! It is not overly impressive but it IS pretty good. Point is, I can get bands almost as good for a third of the price. Not sure the week long wait and the difficulty of getting the band on my Tag outweighed just taking it to my watch guy and buying one of his cheesy leather bands that look good for a few months and cost about $12-$15 and he puts them on for me. I'm sure this band will last longer. Clearly it is of better quality. Next time...likely the easier route for me. Nothing against the band, just the process. Only 4 stars because I bought a nice leather laptop bag (nice quality leather) from Wilsons for just as good leather and a little over twice what I paid for this. That huge amount of quality leather makes this comparatively tiny amount of leather seem very overpriced."
4.0,"These stay on my feet -- which is why I like Hanes.  However they shed inside.  My feet are covered in black fuzz after wearing (after the socks have been washed several times).  My older, higher cut Hanes never did that."
4.0,"Beautiful bead. My only reservation is that the bead did not come with clear instructions on how to attach the photo. My guess is that if you are familiar with jewelry making it would be obvious, but it was not for me! The instructions say &#34;Cut out a small piece of Seal-Itz strip approximately the same size as your cut out photo, and peel back one side to reveal the adhesive. Place your photo onto the exposed adhesive, and cut out around the photo again.&#34;. What they do not mention, is that the Seal-Itz does not come with the bead, and needs to be purchased separately. Additionally, you need two pieces of the Seal-Itz- one to affix the photo to the bead, and another to affix the photo to the acrylic. Once I figured that out, assembly was very smooth, and I was thrilled with the finished bead. It made a wonderful gift!"
4.0,"I do have to adjust the hoop quite often throughout the day. I thought it was too thick when I first opened them up, but they fit great."
4.0,Nice shirt but not stitched as I expected it to be. Button holes a little small.
4.0,"It's a very cute dress, and it accentuates the curves very nicely! But... there isn't enough space for your boobs, if that makes any sense. The seam cuts across my breast rather than under like most dresses would. Other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />I'm 6'0, 160lbs, and ordered a medium. I like my dresses a little tighter so it fit perfect. Not long enough for floor length w/ my height, but would still order it knowing that ahead of time."
4.0,"The elastic could've ""stopped a hip from hemorrhaging"" but I guess that's better than having it fall off the head during the night, because of being ""stretched out?"""
4.0,"I think these sunglasses are really cute style-wise. As for them being polarized sunglasses, I've seen much better, things don't look much bolder with these on, but it does help keep the sun out of your eyes for sure. One plus that I really like is that they don't leave marks on my nose or above my eyebrows like some others do!"
4.0,"light, comfortable. Use them a lot around the house. Don't think they would last this long<br />They run big, I got the whole size smaller and fit well"
4.0,"Very soft and well made. The only issue was sizing. It runs about 5 sizes too large, even for sleeping. Way too much extra material. I would suggest for someone that likes something huge to sleep in."
4.0,"Light and headband is comfortable.<br />The adjustable tie works fine but I need a better “closure” device.<br />I would have given this product a 5-star rating<br />were the tightening design more robust to hold hold  in place after an hour. Large strands of hair worked itself out after 40 mins of wear. I wear this at home when I make food for my family so that’s OK. May not be IDEAL for professional staff.<br />Clean, light (not flimsy) and comfortable."
4.0,"My son is almost 4 years old and I must say he is a little tall for his age so I ordered one for 5 years and they fit okay on him, not much allowance for him to use it longer. So I suggest order at least 2 sizes up. But setting the sizing aside, the quality of this polo shirt and shorts are nice. It is made of 100% cotton, they are so soft and comfortable. I think this doesn't need ironing, just fold them right away after drying it. The price is just right for this set. My son is happy with this outfit. A nice combination and the colors are great.<br />I received this Ferenyi Toddler Boys Clothing Boys' Solid Pique Polo Shirt and Denim Shorts Sets free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This does not affect the time, effort and integrity I put into a review that would be beneficial to any fellow customer. I have no relationship with sellers and manufacturers. I base all my reviews on quality, value, and personal experience of the product."
4.0,Cute baseball earrings and blingy!  A little heavier than expected.
4.0,"The length for me was just as its shown on the model. I'm 5'4&#34; and a curvy 200lbs. I ordered a size XL in Black. It's a cute dress, thin material sochoose your under garments wisely. But for casual summer day or night"
4.0,"Loved the material, but too large."
4.0,This shirt fits well and is great for horse riding. Stains wash out easily and it looks cool!
4.0,"Priced reasonably... Received three pairs, thinking I was buying one pair.  I bought them to wear with a pendant and was disappointed of the smaller size compared to my pendant, but overall I have enjoyed wearing them and enjoyed gifting the other two pairs."
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I purchased the smaller size. The result is a slightly loose but okay-fit around the bust, yet a little snug around the waste. Still this shirt does a great job as a warm base garment when worn under a tank top."
4.0,I followed the size chart and it was too big I'm going to give it away as a gift.
4.0,Cold Steel has a reputation as the best--they are.
4.0,The shirt is really cute. The sleeves are a little long. I was not happy about how the bow looked when I took the shirt out of the package. I had to undo and re-tie the bow. The fit is a little weird but it’s not a big deal.
4.0,Info about shorts should have stated it was made for a slim person.
4.0,"I love the way these look, but these aren't just regular earrings. The posts are thicker and seem like a bigger gauge than your typical earring, so it does take a bit to get them in. It once they are in they fit great and stay in! I love how the backs screw on and are flat so I can leave them in and sleep on them. I have not tried the hoops yet but I mainly bought them just for the studs."
4.0,"What a great idea! It's been too hot for me to wear it out, but I have tried it. Super cute, fits great and works like a charm. Might have to buy one for my sister now cuz she wants one as well."
4.0,It’s beautiful n perfect! Not cheap looking like the other ones on amazon! The band is a rose gold but little different from the rose gold face Apple Watch itself. You only can tell if you really look at it.
4.0,Very cute and arrived quickly!
4.0,"Top in the breast area(I have a small chest though) a little large and bottoms were very high thigh. Still very cute though, kinda just bought it for the top anyways."
4.0,"The bag is beautiful, but larger and heavier than expected. I believe it would be beautiful for a larger built person, but I intend to make use of it anyway!"
4.0,Somewhat smaller thank the pic.  But good for the price.  I would order them again
4.0,Beautiful dress but just a little tighter on the arms then what I expected
4.0,"Wife said the 12-14 size were very snug. She did say they were VERY VERY warm. Too hot for her to sleep in, so now she just wear them around the house."
4.0,"I really like these boots. They look very stylish and go with almost anything casual. The only drawback is the &#34;sock&#34; like knitted insole at the top of the boot. You have to hold it with both hands in order to put the shoe on otherwise it is pushed down in the shoe with your foot. Also, it is a bit snug, (not a problem for me, but can see it as one for others) so I have to wear thin socks or no socks at all."
4.0,Nice fabric. Really like the way they are calf-high. Handsome.
4.0,"They do what I was expecting them to do so far, but they are getting washed for the first time since I received them but waiting to see if they still do what I expected them to do after they get wasked."
4.0,"My daughter took to these little water shoes very well! She says they are comfy and she likes the colorful design. I like the thick rubber sole which adds stability to the shoe. However, she's only worn them a few times and the fabric in the toe area is already fraying. With that being said, I would buy them again."
4.0,I love the shoes.  They are very nice but a bit small..I think I can stretch them enough to wear..I gave them 4 stars only because of the fit or it would of been 5 stars..
4.0,A little big for a small and kind of heavy but overall not bad
4.0,"I love these &#34;shades&#34;!!! They are attractive and polarized. Great combination!<br />However, ordered 2 pair on them to share with my daughter, and, guess what? They were delivered to another address........and NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE !!!<br />HELP ME, PLEASE<br />Jane Lomel<br />2001 Twinbridge Cir<br />Ocala, FL 34471"
4.0,"So far so good with this hat. Breathes really well, and is super light and comfortable while running. Thought the brim would be a little smaller, but otherwise serves my purpose perfectly. And can't beat the price. Wish it shipped faster than a few weeks though."
4.0,Make sure u read the OVERSIZED part. They hella
4.0,They are cute and nicely sized. I don't like that the flat side without the chocolate design is what is usually visible. Would be better if both sides have the design
4.0,Lovely accessories for casual or formal events
4.0,"These earrings are a nice statement piece but uncomfortably heavy on my ears due to the size, all the beads, metal and tassels. I was anticipating it be smaller than it is as they are quite large. I was hoping to wear it with a white Bohemian dress I have but because of the weight it’s a no go for me.<br />The craftmanship, golden color and style is cute and I would have kept them if it was lighter!"
4.0,They are comfy. A little snug but a compression snug and too tight snug. I haven't hiked in them. But I have worn them all day in boots and they weren't too hot.
4.0,Not Pandora
4.0,These pants have a lot of potential to be great.  My only problem is that they ripped along the seam near the crotch area.  I took them to a clothing alteration store near my home and they put a heavy fabric patch over the seam (not just sew the seam back together).  They work great now and i havent had any other problems.
4.0,"I really like these.  They are almost as good as Athletas.  The only difference is they don’t have the slightly tacky bike short part that doesn’t move on your leg, but it really isn’t necessary."
4.0,"This necklace is really pretty and looks very feminine and delicate. The chain is very nice too, but it is delicate as well so you have to be careful not to rip it. I like everything about this necklace, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is that the workmanship is a little rough in certain places, but nothing that would prevent me from wearing and enjoying it. Overall, great buy!"
4.0,As good as quality as original<br />But with more flavor
4.0,"My husband wanted a daily watch for office. This is good, but the dial is a bit larger than it needs to be. So returning it. If you have normal size hand, this watch looks elegant."
4.0,"Very nice.  A little larger than the origami Mom charm.  But, there are no issues seeing it, very good charm for a Mom themed locket."
4.0,A nice top off to Cleopatra costume
4.0,"Loved this rolo chain, it is stronger then others I have used."
4.0,Went really well with my outfit Slowly falling apart but it gives a characteristic look
4.0,"As  remote sales representative, working from home 90% of the time, these blue light blocking glasses have helped my eye strain tremendously over the short period of time that I have owned them. I plan to purchase an additional pair for travel."
4.0,"I like the value of these mask. But the white lining isn’t practical, not only for wearing them more than once it for washing them too."
4.0,Very pretty just as described the only thing is the placement of the pin in the back makes the weight of it to heavy at the top and weighs down garments it is attached to.
4.0,"Great color, soft material but a little too soft it slips off so I had to put extra holes in it to stay on. But I also have a small wrist. Its not as great quality of the original that came with my watch."
4.0,These earrings are gorgeous!  The crystals are as sparkly as diamonds.  They have a quality feel.  I did not give the last star as they are a bit heavy for me.  I will wear these for dressing up!! They are just a bit too heavy for everyday.
4.0,I was looking for a new key chain that would go with my Toyota Tundra. This key chain looks classy yet rugged. I've had it for 3 months and it is still looking good. It is very easy to add or remove keys on the fly.
4.0,Wore it to my sisters wedding.  Got many compliments.
4.0,"So far so good, time tell with watch winders in terms of how long they last. Compared to my last unit the motor is very quiet."
4.0,Large is kind of medium
4.0,"This is a cute necklace and chain.  The one problem is I developed a rash on the back of my neck.  I am allergic to nickel, but don't know if that was the problem here."
4.0,The earrings look almost like a clear cz with very little blue in them.  They are still very pretty and I would buy again.
4.0,These socks look exactly like the picture. My boyfriend is a huge sock person so I always try to come up with new creative options. These are now his Thanksgiving socks of choice. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because the stitching of the turkey design causes certain areas of the socks to not be very flexible. My boyfriend had some trouble sliding them over his heel but was perfectly fine once he got them on.
4.0,Zipper was broken but the seller made it right. It's a very nice jacket though and fit my daughter perfect besides the zipper being broke
4.0,Much better than the silicone band that comes with the fitbit!
4.0,The length of the necklace is good for many outfits.  The clasp area seems flimsy.  It appears to be real silver.
4.0,"Very cute, sturdy material"
4.0,"Great price, however center nose piece will tarnish green. Then the price was not good because it cost me $600 for lenses"
4.0,"This is a very pretty ring. It’s a little dainty, but I like it."
4.0,It is better to take one size bigger. But the tights are perfect except the size
4.0,"It’s comfortable and durable but not as attractive as I hoped. Plus, I had to put an insert in because it was a bit too flat for me."
4.0,Ordered for a friend.  She was most happy with these.  Well worth the price.
4.0,"The compression of these socks is excellent, but I don't recommend purchasing the polka dot pattern. The dots are woven into the fabric so the pattern on the reverse side is raised and bumpy. When you take the socks off, you will be left with a polka dot pattern in your skin!"
4.0,"My SO bought me this for a &#34; No Occasion &#34; gift. The only complaints I have for this purse/tote, is the inside side pockets are a bit on the small size. And the straps aren't long enough, just a small bit discomfort under the arms if carrying over the shoulder. On the plus side,the two open pockets on the inside are plenty deep. The inside zippered pocket also has plenty of room. The wine color is &#34; Spot On &#34;. I really like the gold tone accents. All and all, a VERY good purse."
4.0,Great color it will match my other cartilage earrings
4.0,Nice accessory<br />Could be a bit weightier- to hang better.<br />Great for the price
4.0,The chaps look great but you will definitely need to alter or way too long even on me and I'm 6' 2
4.0,"Love the product thus far. With the snug fit, it was kind of difficult to put on but when I figured it out there were no issues."
4.0,A little large but excellent quality.
4.0,"I'm 5&#34;2' I feel that is dress is meant for taller people, but I am still very happy with this purchase. So pretty!"
4.0,"Beautiful dress! It fits like a glove, and on my curvy figure was flattering along the neckline and in the shape of the dress. A forgiving, stretchy fabric make the dress even better."
4.0,"Very pretty and elegant wish it was just a little bigger.  Very pretty, I am going to keep it and give to my daughter as a present."
4.0,"The color is more of a murky/muddy orange. I'm ok with the color, I'm a guy so a strong red may be too much. The cord is a very cheap shiny cotton material to make it look like leather. The cord is also really long even at the tightest it hung too low. Not that big of an issue, just cut it, burn the ends and tie it again. Overall I am satisfied with it, however the price point is too high for what it is. This should be priced in the $7-$10 range. I would like to get different kinds of stones because I like the donut style for men but the price point is not there."
4.0,Good fit with ordering a :-P size. Came separate and not individually wrap; curious
4.0,Really like this product.<br />Buy it all the time.<br />Have gifted it to friends and family.<br />They all love it.<br />Will buy it again
4.0,Like this shirt. I would go down a size. Got a large but could’ve gotten away with a medium. Overall I like the breathable fabric.
4.0,I think the sizing issue is different for different sizes. I sized up as the reviews I saw suggested to. I would usually wear a 2-3x and I got a 4x to be safe. Well they are pretty baggy most noticeable in the legs but for my size I have relatively small calf's if you have larger ankles and calf's theses may fit you perfectly. They are pretty thin but not reviling and they are very soft and comfy. I will probably just use theses for pj's.
4.0,"I bought these pants and upon receiving them found the fit to be extremely odd.  They were a little loose on the waist but super tight in the thigh area right above the knee up to the point it was extremely uncomfortable and if I squatted down I would probably rip them.  I requested a return and was given my money back, and I didn't even have to go to the hassle of returning the item.  I don't know if I got a factory defect; I have read some other reviews that say the size is way too small though I really didn't have an issue in the rest of the pant just in that one area, but it was bad enough to make them unwearable.  They had great customer service though responded to my request quickly and effectively."
4.0,Love it fits great..gracias
4.0,"Fits great, beautiful pants. The only reason I gave it a four star is because I've already had to fix a ripped seam. Besides that, I love it."
4.0,Pretty great product! Saves me from buying new jeans.
4.0,"I absolutely loved this necklace! Wore it on my first plane ride in 25 years. Since obsidian is a protective stone I held the cute, well carved bunny throughout the flight. I mean, it truly is adorable. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is one of the ears broke off somehow so I haven't been able to wear it."
4.0,Love the floral pattern and it big on the thighs
4.0,normally wear XL or XXL and ordered this in an XXL. its on the fitted side but i like the dress and boyfriend loves it.
4.0,"Love them, cute and comfortable for my tragus. Got an 8mm but should have went with the 6mm."
4.0,"I really like this dress.  The material seems to be of good quality with no obvious defects in the dress.  It is true to the photo in the listing as well.<br /><br />I am 5'10&#34; and about a size 12-14.  I purchased a large.  This dress is cut for someone with more rounded hips which is not me.  It is so generous in the hip area, in fact, that I will need to alter it a little bit on my sewing machine.  Not a big issue for me but might be for others who don't sew.  The pockets add even more fullness in the hips so keep that in mind.  I should have looked more closely at the photos because there is one that shows the dress is not cut straight.<br /><br />That said it is really long!  It is almost impossible finding maxi dresses that hit my ankles.  So that is really nice!  I think this will become a summer staple after I make my alterations.  It is easily dressed up or down!<br /><br />One other very minor thing is that the tag doesn't say what the fabric is composed of and while the care instructions say to hand wash, knowing the type of fabric I was dealing with would help me determine whether hand washing was really necessary.  I'm sure it is listed here in the ad so I will double check but it would be nice to have that info on hand when I'm doing laundry.  But like I said that is a minor gripe."
4.0,"nice shirt.  a bit thin, but still very cute."
4.0,"The springs can get bent pretty easily, but overall a good product, and for the price, not going to worry about it."
4.0,She'll grow into them.
4.0,"Jersey was a little large, but worked well for my 12 year old son."
4.0,"Lightweight sweater/sweatshirt lining material, very soft and flattering. The top does not has as much fabric/fold over as much as shown."
4.0,"Very cute lightweight and sheer cardigan, I got this for my daughter in XXL, which is what she typically would wear and it fits well. She's machine washed and dried this very often and it's held up beautifully and no noticeable shrinkage. She wears this over tank tops and was able to wear it all seasons except for the absolute hottest days, but it is not a cardigan for warmth."
4.0,Nice light summer robe. With the waffle weave it won't stick to my skin after a shower.  I'm happy with it but contemplated ordering 1 size smaller.  Ultimately decided against that since it wraps and one can just tie it.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:636887a80fc52dd473d94b9c6fe93180]] Es lindo queda perfecto pero se me daño el mismo día
4.0,I like the core power better but at 10 bucks cheaper great deal.
4.0,"Purchased the gray bag and it is super nice. Great for the price and very roomy (kind of like the same size as beach cooler tote). Definitely worth getting. Only two things that were wrong... 1. All the zippers were off their track and a bit difficult to fix; but after much patience, I managed to get them unstuck and back on track; 2. Funky, fishy smell. The smell will eventually subside.., just hope the zippers don't break off. Otherwise, a great looking bag!"
4.0,"Bought the brown gloves with cashmere lining. Very stylish - the brown piping adds a nice touch. Touchscreen function works very well. They fit as expected, though a bit snug. In temperature of mid-20's, my hands got cold within 10 minutes, so set your expectations."
4.0,"The hubs is very pleased with these swim suits. He ordered one in navy and one in black and reports that you can't beat the value for the money. Since bathing suits don't hold up as well as they used to (the public pools use a lot of chlorine), he was glad to find decent suits at a good price and won't fret if they don't last more than one season of use."
4.0,"Worked well for my son’s glasses, but we need to reapply often. I think this is more because my son touches his lenses and gets smudges on them so it wipes the product off. Overall, works well."
4.0,I've bought several of these in different colors and I am we'll pleased. They are actually longer than the original band. Shipping was within a couple of weeks or less and arrived in good shape.
4.0,"Cute sunglasses for kids. They fit well and come with a nice soft fabric carrying case that will help keep them clean. I took off one star because the pair I received has one lens that is not properly seated in the frame. I can feel/hear it jiggling a little when I move the glasses around. There doesn't seem to be a way to tighten it, so hopefully it won't present a problem down the road."
4.0,"These are great jeans! Surprisingly! I'm 5'9"" and normally wear a 14/16. I ordered the 3XL and they are a perfect fit without me having to worry about tummy circulation being cut off. They have great stretch. I wish they were an inch or 2 longer as when I put on heels or platforms, the bottoms come to my ankles."
4.0,The legs came a little short but i used a hair dryer and bended it to be longer. However it didnt come with the left nose cushion
4.0,Material good
4.0,Like itl
4.0,"Pretty cool! The snaps in the crotch area are convenient. A little uncomfortable, but thats hard to avoid. I got a lot of compliments and have been able to wear it for multiple occasions"
4.0,I like the stone bu the necklace string is very cheap.  Should have gotten the sterling silver chain.
4.0,"This is good quality for the cheap price. After reading reviews, I sized up from my normal size and it fits perfect! The ""sleeves"" that lay off your shoulders are WAY too big but it will be an easy fix with my sewing machine. Other than that I love this shirt!"
4.0,Bought as a gift for niece so haven't examined it myself. She is happy though.
4.0,"Nice look.  Sturdy. Expect it so last.  It stretches more than I expected it would, though this is not a bad thing as it still does its job and has a comfortable relaxed feel when wearing it.  If you like the feel of a real tight belt, or hang heavy stuff from your belt, then this isn't for you."
4.0,"Super cute, I had lots of compliments when I wore it!"
4.0,"Nice top but too big I know it is not form fitting but it was definitely too big. I'm little over 5'5 weigh 133 lbs I have bigger hips and a smaller waist. I ordered a medium and should've got a small, possibility even xsm. Cute sheer top though."
4.0,Its a nice light jacket.  Runs small and due to pulling it over your head this is extra important.
4.0,Fits as expected! Great item!
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and well made! The chiffon flows nicely over the lining.  However, I must send it back because it's a bit too small. Also, the color was suppose to be purple, but what came is more like a pink berry color which I really think is pretty, and would have kept, but the sizing on me doesn't work. I wear a 14-16, ordered a XXL, and like I stated, is a bit too small on me."
4.0,Love the color and style of the jacket.  It does fit a bit small but I was unable to return because a larger size was unavailable.
4.0,The bracelet is very nice and delicate. My wife loves it.<br />I think that the chain it self could be a little thicker so that it wouldn’t break easily.
4.0,"It is a little stiff now that I have it, maybe because I like the flexible or chain type&#34;"
4.0,Good fit with a little stretch to it. No need for conventional belts ever again.
4.0,VERY PRETTY BREAKS EASY AFTER WEARING TWICE IT BROKE
4.0,Good for workouts
4.0,"These socks are fine, helps on long walks with a bunion"
4.0,"Fits perfect, and looks great on."
4.0,Very nice ! There was just one stone missing but that can be easily fixed😀
4.0,A tad large but work perfectly.  Like the quick dry.
4.0,"Nice material. Very comfortable.  The split is in the back not in the front as the picture shows, but it does not look bad."
4.0,Perfect for my five year old's ladybug costume.  Surprisingly long.  A bit on the thin side but colors are great.
4.0,Fabric was a but thinner than expected but the design is fantastic. Purchased as a gift. Will update sizing once he's had a chance to wear it.
4.0,Very cute and easy to attach even for little hands. Disappointed though two have broken already. I won’t buy them again but maybe for older kids Ethan are not so rough on their lanyards they’d be better!
4.0,Sleeves are kind of big for a small..
4.0,It fits my daughter perfectly... only bad part is i ordered a size bigger than what she is currently in so a heads up this particular coat runs roughly one size smaller. Great coat though.
4.0,"My daughter is 4 years old, just over 40lbs and 3'5&#34; tall.<br /><br />She typically wears a 5-6, but because this item runs small I got her the 6-8. It fits great, with a little room for her to grow into.<br /><br />She has this set in purple(lilac) and red(true red). The leotard is mostly cotton and the skirt is mostly polyester.<br /><br />I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this item.<br /><br />Hope this helps:)"
4.0,Purchased this to wear on our first cruise.  It fits cute but it stays terribly wrinkled all the time.  Even after ironing it wrinkled right back up to the point of not really being wearable.  Not sure how much use it will be if it has to be ironed and wrinkles anyway...
4.0,"I bought these for my son, he has a 38 waist and the large was just right, no room to grow though, material and style very nice, would buy again except a XL."
4.0,"Love the dress, a little short but I am wearing it anyway."
4.0,"It's just a bit too large but nothing I can't adjust. I just fold the top down a bit and it looks better. The design looks cool, I love how it's adjustable, and it comes with padding to place inside the mask. I honestly love this mask, and it being slightly too big isn't much of an issue."
4.0,"I cut these into individual sleeves to hold credit cards in a money clip (to avoid damaging the magnetic strips on the credit cards. when they get nasty or torn, i just replace them, and a dozen lasts me a couple years."
4.0,"They fit fine but a little on the large size for my 10 1/2 shoe size, but I would rather they be slightly large than slightly small. The toes have a little extra material but I am keeping them as some of the toe socks I've bought in the past have shrunk a little after washing and become a little snug."
4.0,"It fits skin tight for sure.  I am 37-33-41 and I just squeeze into it.  So if you are bigger than that good luck getting it on.  I would have rather had a size large, but I do like it so I am keeping it."
4.0,"Great product, however the ends are to big for titanium rim glasses. Bought these before and the ends were smaller and worked great."
4.0,"Very comfortable, a little shorter than I expected"
4.0,"Fabric was ok, but the elastic above the breast kept rolling down/flipping over while I was trying it on, so I returned. If that problem didn’t exist, it would have been super cute.  Maybe it was just my body ?"
4.0,"Update*** I purchased this belt and after 3 months the pin that holds the buckle together fell out and was lost. I reached out to the company and they replaced the buckle right away!<br /><br />This is a quality, cut to fit belt that is priced just right. The color is true to the picture and this is a great accessory for any occasion."
4.0,Cute and stretchy waist. a little big but they’re comfortable. I ordered a medium
4.0,Super fast delivery. Great shirt at the price.
4.0,The body of the dress fit great and it wasn't sheer at all. The arms are small compared to how the rest of it was cut. Otherwise worth it
4.0,"I highly recommend this product, it is elegant and well crafted but above all very unique.  It is a great buy for the price and will certainly not go wrong with this item as a gift."
4.0,Looks great and is comfortable but has a slightly sticky texture. Definitely feels like rubber.
4.0,Its amazing!! Its perfect!! Its usefull!! Its come in diffetent design and color!! Its unisex!!
4.0,I like the headband. Used it for working out and it's very comfortable.
4.0,"If you are a bit larger in the front but slimmer in the butt, might be pretty snug holding"
4.0,"Good product, fast shipping!"
4.0,It is a little thin being chiffon but would pair very well with a Cami underneath. It is a nice top. I love the color.
4.0,"Removing links was a learning experience, but I figured it out. Love the look."
4.0,"I do love my Fitbit Versa, but the bands can be tedious to attach. This one was not quite as challenging which might just be the earning curve on my part. I do like the color."
4.0,Super thick and soft.  Good for keeping warm and for modesty but hard to put on the sleeves when the skin is wet.  We sized up so we could use them for years to come.
4.0,"This necklace by Enzomar is unique and eye-catching. The pendant (shaped like a disc) is about the size of a quarter and has a black base/tone. The chain is 925 sterling silver with a rose gold overlay. It is encrusted with clear stones of various shapes and sizes. The length of the chain is nice. This necklace can be worn on a variety of occasions, dressy or casual. It’s just as cute with jeans as it is with a dress. And finally, it is inexpensive and great addition to my costume jewelry. I would recommend it for ladies of all ages."
4.0,"Phrasing... These glasses are quality built and have a great design. My only problem is that they are a but smaller than I expected, the arms are double jointed (best way i can explain it) so they fit on a big face (like mine) well, the lenses and frame are smaller, but even with that being said they still look great. Keeping these, probs going to grab another pair."
4.0,Very shiny but not overly ornate.  The material was bit lighter sought than expected.
4.0,"I love the sturdiness of these, BUT I don’t use the yellow gold color one because it doesn’t have a nice color. It’s too orangy does look similar to real gold"
4.0,I really liked the band for the month that it worked for me. After 30 days both of the retaining clips fell off. Technically it's still usable but looks weird without the clips to hold the band together.
4.0,Nice wallet I love red.
4.0,"I LOVE this dress!! Bought it to wear to a wedding... and I literally can NOT wait till then... I'm making my BF take me on a date so I can wear it before that!!  The material is nice and thick, yet still has a little stretch to it... not stretchy per say, but has a nice give to it.  It has a bit of a sheen to the fabric so it dresses up nicely!  the color blocking is SUPER slimming and the cut is certainly flattering on us curvy gals!  I have a large bust (34DDD) so it is a little snug around the boob area, but I was fully prepared for that! I DEF recommend this dress... for the price.. you can't beat it!"
4.0,They were really nice but kept sliding down.
4.0,"Ended up sending this back because the top was much to large for me and very form fitting!  I think it was meant for someone with less curves but all in all, a nice product!  I didn’t wear it but if I was not so curvy , I would have.  Pretty color!"
4.0,"Pretty but runs very small — I wear an XS to S in most things (25 inch waist, 33 inch hips) and ordered a small, but I could barely close the zipper. Also, it’s not an elastic waist like it says. I may reorder in a larger size, though, bc I actually really love the pattern and colors!"
4.0,I followed the size chart XL but it was a little too big for me. I offered it to someone else and it fit perfect.  The fabric is thick not lightweight.
4.0,Multiple scratches on it with the clear coating coming off in places.  I took off a sticker on it and it took off the clear coating.  I thought about returning it but I am sure it will get many more.  Just hope it doesnt get too bad that the car design peels off.  We will see how it goes after our trip.  Love the backpack that comes with it.
4.0,Nice vest for parties. Durable to wash. I will buy more as gift
4.0,This is a cute bracelet but the clasp broke the first time I wore it. :(
4.0,Lenses not as clear as I was hoping. But get lots of compliments. Like how stylish they are
4.0,"Nice shirt .. a tad on the small size, and the red is a bit off from picture (a bit on the orange side of red, not deep red).  But my husband likes it and wears it daily around the house for added warmth."
4.0,I have the same pearls on a necklace and earrings set.......I couldn't have matched it so perfectly if I had tried.  It's like Christmas every day with all this jewelry arriving.
4.0,Nice length and comfortable fabric
4.0,I bought these because they're super cute and light weight. My baby is 12 months old and wears US4 from all other brands but these ones don't fit her. I ended up giving them to a friend with a 8 months old. I want to reorder a size 6 but it's not prime member eligible. Make sure you order at least 1 size up for your kid.
4.0,They were not compression tops at all.  I do not recommend
4.0,"Very nice silky-feel fabric, cute style on the model.  I'm 5""1"", 139 pounds, 36D, petite 74 year old curvy woman.  I ordered the suggested size Large.  The dress fits OK in the shoulders and bust, and the elastic makes the waist stretchy.  My complaint is that it's so short waisted -- it doesn't fit like the picture.  That being said, the skirt is 6"" too long and hits just above the ankle.  It wasn't an expensive dress, and I can't complain about the price.  I'll keep it, but I'll alter it by cutting off the too-long skirt and lengthening the bodice with an insert at the midriff so it's not so short-waisted.  A lot of trouble, I know, but I expect my dresses to fit."
4.0,They are warm and fit well.
4.0,"Super cute, but snug. I bought the L and there was no way I could wear it in public. The arms are really snug. i'm generally a size 12, 36DD."
4.0,"I love this dress! The material is good, the style is great for a 50+ woman. I recommend it for any size person."
4.0,As was expected.
4.0,"I love the look of this hat. The bill is ever so slightly upward pointing, but not really enough that anyone else has noticed. Great hat for the price."
4.0,"These are lovely socks. Thick, great length, stay on well. But they are slippery. no grips on the bottom makes it so that in our kitchen, our 13 month old is sliding around like an ice rink. Wish they had grips on the bottoms like most socks for this age group."
4.0,Very nice. Only complaint is that the photo did not match the description. I ended up with pants when I thought I ordered a top. No issues was able to also order the top separately. Just check the description.
4.0,It was a bit to short but i really love the style and the material is good. A size larger would have been a perfect fit.
4.0,Very pretty bracelet with intricate details. I love it!
4.0,Nice for the price and fast shipping.
4.0,Definitely buy a size or two up.  Really good quality though like their shirts.
4.0,"They’re not real feathers but they’re pretty cool, they’re really detailed. They’re sort of like tent material, and iron them because the come folded"
4.0,"Perfect fit, a little difficult to remove."
4.0,"The design and colors are holding up fine, but the interior fabric behind the cards ripped on the first week. Didn't overstuff or abuse it. Since the rest was holding up fine, and I really liked the design, I didn't bother returning it"
4.0,Great color and screen print.  The cotton material could be softer.  The shirt is a bit scratchy.
4.0,"Great neon green color! Great value. Glad  ring is silver, could be a bit stronger and band a bit more comfortable on wrist. I would buy again."
4.0,Wish the chain was a little thicker.
4.0,"Daughter loved this robe. Snout of the unicorn is a little weird (very generous hood), tends to hang in her face, but doesnt seem to mind. Fabric was squishy. Nice for the price!!"
4.0,"These really helped save my sanity. My son kept leaking EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. and sometimes during naps. These definitely helped. We had a few leaks over the past 3 months but I was ok with that. What I didn't like is that they didn't absorb very well. My son's skin would be wet when I would take them off. Also, they didn't seem to contour properly to my son's abdomen. But like I said, they do work, they just need to be a little more absorbent to keep baby's skin dry as well. I switched to cloth diapers over a disposable diaper and am happy with the results so far."
4.0,As advertised. Very sturdy
4.0,Received the product in a timely manner. Easy to clean and the size choices are great. The only problem I had was that my ears got irritated when I would wear it for 12hrs and removed at night.
4.0,"These are bigger than expected, I am very happy! I bought 3 of them in different colors for Christmas gifts. Can't wait to give them out!"
4.0,"Love these! They are exactly as pictured and come with the case too. I bought them for my 4 year old and they fit him perfectly! Would definitely buy again. 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'm not totally convinced they are polarized, but they're still great and protect from the sun!"
4.0,I needed the XL because of how it would fit on my mid section however the crotch area was then down by my knees. So it’s very nice for taller people. The hoodie with the head part is heavy because there is a foam part that sits on your head that gives it the extra height for the face. Other then that it is a quality made item. The zipper is a dual zipper that can be zipped up and down at the same time. I suppose so that if your a guy you could easily pee in it. The zipper it’s self is a high quality zipper as well that easily slides up and down and there are two pockets with zippers. Great costume overall that kept me warm and got lots of laughs.
4.0,"Received in great packaging, love all the pockets and space to hold everything. (I always carry too much personal items in my purses). The color is not a royal blue or navy blue, almost has a hint of gray to purple blue. Love the color though. Much heavier for a handbag that is PU/faux leather. Very soft, good shoulder straps that can be removed and just use the attached sewn in straps. The ONLY thing that I wish that was different is sewn in interior polyester lining. Not a dire problem."
4.0,I like this necklace as the color is  good and strong.  It is a little chunky but will go well with my navy sweater.
4.0,"Not the top of the line loupe, but definately worth the money. Very reasonably priced, and good quality for that price."
4.0,"Not the most comfortable sunglasses I've ever worn, but they are stylish and look pretty cool.  Grey luminescent finish is pretty unique."
4.0,"Really liked this mask.  It is comfortable, lightweight, stretchy and has adjustable loops for over the ears."
4.0,These are a great value and the look is super in right now. I wear theM often. Love everything about them except the backs of them can slip off which is super annoying.
4.0,"Perfect work dress. Order a size up, I’m a small and it fit snug ( like club dress snug).. for professional settings I would go with a size up for a better fit. Other than that it’s a beautiful dress."
4.0,Nice well made belt. Be sure to get a size larger than your normal waist size.
4.0,super cute! and good price for 3 bracelets.  gave them out to my friends and they adored them.<br />just try not to pull cuz the link will break
4.0,"I like these gloves they are what I wanted but the color I got is not dark gray, Its more of a blue gray which might not seem like a big deal, but it doesn't match the scarf I wanted it to match. Also they are pretty small, fine for me but not sure one size will fit all."
4.0,Didn't look anything like the picture poor quality and run small in size
4.0,I almost returned this dress because the hemline was not finished. However I totally fell in love with it once I put it on.
4.0,"Being a “one size “ item, I thought it fit very nicely. The fabric is nice but I feel like it would wrinkle easily. I returned mine because when I was buttoned, one side was about a half inch shorter than the other. It was very noticeable so, sadly, I returned mine"
4.0,I thought it was larger. Its just a tiny little thing but it did the job
4.0,"I like the sparkle of the gems on this. I wore it in my septum for a few days, paint didnt chip, yet! bar feels weird, but probably because i'm used to wearing hooked rings, not straight bars. so that part for me is uncomfortable. I hoped to be able to wear it all the time, but it will work for certain events, just not long-term wear."
4.0,"Great quality. Soft material, very comfortable. Exactly as described."
4.0,Sturdy and well made. Will last. Bob
4.0,Delivered on time and exactly as described. Only reason a 4 is the back (post?) of one of the earrings keeps falling off. Easy fix as I have replacements. They look nice
4.0,"Outside of taking way too long to reach me, its exactly what it is for its price"
4.0,"I am 5'4 160lb 36-29-42.5<br /><br />It is a crisp white with embroidered details. Exactly as the photo. Not too thin. I think it's appropiate for work, casual enough with jeans and still look put together. A bit boxy, but I think I can pull it off."
4.0,Bought the smallest size but still very big and baggy. But I like the color and style
4.0,"Very comfy and cheap, but they do shrink and run small. Go up a size for sure. Otherwise great comfy sleeping shorts"
4.0,amazing for infants or for the second or third holes. i do not have cartridge piercing so i don't know how they hold up but i'm assuming the same as another ear piercing
4.0,"When I first received the band, I LOVED it. It looks great and fits great! However, after having it for only about a week, one of the pins fell out of a link while I was walking. I did have to remove some links to make the band fit my wrist, so I thought I would be able to fix it. However, the pin that fell out is longer than the others so I could not fix it. I am not happy that it fell apart after only owning it for 1 week. I have messaged the seller and hope to hear back soon.<br /><br />******UPDATE******<br /><br />The seller responded quickly and is sending me new pins to fix the band I have and also sending me a new band of my choice! Great customer service & quick response!"
4.0,"They were nice, soft and comfortable. I needed a size larger than expected so I returned them. The pockets kinda stuck out awkwardly. But that couldve been due to being a size too small"
4.0,"I really like these leggings. They are comfortable and fit snugly but not too tight. I was not aware that the top panels were also see through like the ones on the shins, but that’s ok. When I do the squat test, you can see through them so I wear as non-workout leggings with a longer shirt. I love how they hold my stomach in."
4.0,I like the hat. It could be better  if the graphic was clearer.
4.0,I purchased XS an for me it run’s a little large but I wearing it anyway.
4.0,not as good as expected，
4.0,"This looks good! Well made , the clips are pretty good I've had WORSE!!"
4.0,"Super cute and well made! It ran a bit smaller than usual sizes, so people may want to order a size up. It fit, but was tight."
4.0,Very Cute but thought buckles were silver color but were actually gold color.
4.0,The dress is light and comfortable especially great for warm weather. It’s not clingy and lays very nicely. I’m 5’ 8” and it hits halfway between my knees & ankles. I gave it 4 stars because there is only one small snap at the top of the V neck but nothing to keep it closed beneath it so it gaps open. I used a safety pin to prevent it from gapping open.
4.0,"I love this floaty kimono. I decided to use it as outwear and wore it over a black top and jeans. It looked very nice and ""arty"". I tied up the bottom half to shorten it a bit. I also plan to wear this as a beach cover up in the summer. It's quite nice and much better quality than I was expecting."
4.0,Anyway to buy just the grey undershirts?
4.0,These earrings are beautiful except the colors are not as vibrant. Hey
4.0,This coat is gorgeous. The color is beautiful. My only complaint was that one button fell off within half an hour of me wearing it. When I pay decent money for a garment it really ought to stay together for a while!
4.0,"Soft and pretty. I usually wear a medium, bought a large. That was a good idea."
4.0,"Very soft and comfy, and long enough for my long legs"
4.0,My son loves loves loves them
4.0,I like this....dont LOVE it. Doesn't stretch whatsoever so make it kind of uncomfortable. Nicely made though!
4.0,Warm soft and durable. I ordered a size larger and they fit perfect.
4.0,"Bought this wallet for my trip to France. Though I will be using a money belt, wanted something small for my pocket (never want to get into money belt in public). This wallet is prefect. Gave 4 stars because of one negative. The coin section is way too small and is very difficult to remove change."
4.0,A little too small but great value
4.0,looks as pictured for gold ring - carnelian color looks more orange but still nice ring.
4.0,"Not as expected. Kind of big for my taste,  although it is beautiful. The inside pouch is pretty and versatile. I removed it and used in another bag."
4.0,Dress tends to shimmy it’s way up as you walk. Probably would do better with a slip or tights
4.0,It was cute and the material was nice BUT when I tried to loop the string in the back every single loop broke off so I had to stitch them all back on.
4.0,Gray spots in hair
4.0,"I like  these shoes however, I generally take at 10 but had to return the 10 for the size 11 so , they run small. I don't feel I have to break them in after walking around in them for a bit; they are very comfortable. I feel like I can walk around in them for long periods of time without my feet hurting."
4.0,"There's just something about a pair of shoes with pointy toes that makes me walk taller - like I could stomp any effer that gets in my way.  These boots are true to size, arrived super quick from the vendor and are totally kick ass. They didn't even take a day to break in. I wear them constantly - I LOVE THEM."
4.0,"Protects your eyeballs. Prevents you from eating insects. Not the best quality in the world, but it does what it needs to do."
4.0,Cheaper metal but so pretty for the price and arrived a little earlier then expected
4.0,Cute fo price
4.0,"Love customizen my stuff.. different ,unquie,this guard highlighted my watch pretty good..thanks Amazon ..thank you sellers.."
4.0,"Thinner material than I expected, but in no way bad.<br />Longer than I expected too, but I actually like it more that way.<br />Overall beautiful skirt I'm happy I impulse bought."
4.0,"Nice, high quality charms. Love that the writing is on both sides. Would prefer more of some charms (mom and dad) then others (aunt and uncle) as I seem to use those more often."
4.0,but not ugly enough. Overall very satisfied with my purchase. I needed it for my holiday party and got it with time to spare.
4.0,Top was a little big but the skirt fitted good
4.0,The fit is a little big but can be adjusted
4.0,Wonderful quality great value!
4.0,These are sooo cute but I’m on my third pair because they do not secure on very tight. The back always falls off.
4.0,Very pretty.  Exactly as pictured and expected.
4.0,"Fits great, perfect thiness to use as an undershirt for see-through shirts. Docked a star because the plastic pieces for adjusting the straps scratchws my shoulders"
4.0,It's a beautiful dress though strap is loose. I love the the dress and decided to keep it for my daughter's upcoming senior prom.
4.0,They are OK and do help.  Not that easy to get on and off even with the instructions.  They do help with leg swelling though.
4.0,They were made well and a decent price but upon going to purchase a second pair they upped the price. They just missed out on a sale. Also my second purchase was a different design.
4.0,Great design and good product
4.0,"I can't really speak a lot to the quality of this watch. It seems like it's made well enough, I guess. I'm mostly just annoyed by how tiny it is. The case is only 39mm (I measured it) it's not 41 or 43 like I've read all over the page. The band isn't your typical 22 or 24mm you'd typically get with most Sub rips. It seems like maybe 16 or 18mm. I don't know, man. This just annoys me. It feels like a child's watch. When I put it on, I swear I can hear someone singing ""...I'm a big kid now."" I'm sure the watch is fine if you're like, a little manlet with 6 inch wrists. But if your wrist is larger than that, I'd suggest avoiding it.<br /><br />*edit. I also feel bad just ripping on products. So, here's an edit after a couple of days. I WILL state that the watch is beautiful AND well made. Keeps solid time. Just deceptively small. Instead of returning it, I just gifted it to my 12 year old nephew. He loves it. Says he gets a lot of comments on how nice it looks. So, whatever. I'm bumping it up from a two-star to a four-star. Just don't order it if you're a big fat ass like me with 8.5 in wrists."
4.0,"Cute shirt, comfortable"
4.0,Good quality but expensive
4.0,"its a great little skirt! I'm 5 foot even, and I wear it high wasted, works perfect with some chucky heels! the ONLY issue I have with it is it looks like there are supposed to be somewhat pleats in the skirt to make it hang like the picture, but my pleats did not stay, so the skirt hangs a little straighter. nothing some ingenuity couldn't fix, though. All in all, I love the skirt, so far! perfect."
4.0,Very nice looking but should have a heavier string.
4.0,So far it's holding up well.
4.0,"Cute dress, had to reorder a smaller size because it definitely ran big. I'm 5'7 about 150, hourglass shape, 36 c ordered a medium, then went down to a small. Was happy with the length, not too short. Good quality for price, some loose strings here and there from the lace. Color was true to the picture. You'll need a slip for underneath, it's very transparent. The cut/shape of the fabric on the chest area is a little weird looking for my chest size but workable. Overall happy with what I got for the price. Tip: order ahead of time so you can make sure you have the right undergarments that'll fit with this dress (strapless bra, slip, ect)."
4.0,used as a gift
4.0,"A little smaller than I hoped for, tends to get caught behind the steering tree.  Exactly as pictured but small."
4.0,"I bought XL. The measurement is, armpit to armpit is 20.5 inch, side to side at hip is 21 inch, back neck like to hem is 33 inch.<br />It doesn't have a lot of stretch but it is warm. I like it."
4.0,So cute! But having a long torso it did not work for me. Had to send it back
4.0,"I opted for a size larger just in case, I'm glad I did. Fits perfect and flattering to the figure"
4.0,A little snug but fits well.
4.0,"I like this wallet a lot and it's pretty cute but the gold colored clasp thing on the front says ""Forever Young Originally Made in Korea"" which makes it look kind of silly. It is also sort of hard to get my id out of the id slot as when the card slots are all full it's pretty tight."
4.0,"I like how this bag looks, but the sizing is strange. It is a very large bag with a very small opening, so large files or notebooks do not fit, although it looks like it should be a business carry all. I'll still need to find something else. It would probably be more useful for traveling with a large number of very small items."
4.0,Not crazy about the fabric.
4.0,"I absolutely fell in love with all but one pair. The sizes were a perfect fit for my ears and fit snug at that! The only issue I have is with one pair that I can't for the life of me figure out how to open to wear. I actually broke one trying to figure it out. All-in-all, they're great for the price. Maybe include instructions for future pairs so we can actually use them all."
4.0,"Fits great, material is breathable"
4.0,Just got these today. It came a day late but Amazon smoothed things over with me. Pleasantly pleased with the quality. Hopefully it will hold up.
4.0,These capris are perfect for a comfortable workout. Love them
4.0,Not red as appears in the pic. More if a coral color
4.0,When it gets wet the sleeves loosen. The uv protection was perfect.
4.0,"Like,really good quality they are thick and warm."
4.0,"Pretty cool necklace, piece might be a tad bit too big and the paint fades off the chain fairly easy."
4.0,"I like the material of this shirt, but I'm not crazy about the huge cut out. However, it has a drawstring and so you can mostly control the size of it. I pulled it closed about as much as I think I could and I think it's a lot better."
4.0,I really love these belly button rings. They’re very sparkly and pretty. Each individual ring came in its own tiny baggie packed inside a small black cloth bag. The only complaint I have is that the sunflower ring (not the dangling one) is a little bit too short and the point of the top petal digs into my stomach. It’s not awful but it’s just enough that if I turn the wrong way I feel it pinching the hole of my piercing
4.0,Omg
4.0,I lke it
4.0,"Nice, very pretty looking for the price."
4.0,Not bad for the price..
4.0,"These little charms are cute.  I had expected the glass to be pretty fragile, especially since I was using it as key ring charms (one arrived broken), but the glass actually held up fairly well in this case.  What I didn't expect was the loop portion of the cap to snap off completely. (see the attached picture).  This may have just been a fluke, but even counting the damaged one, less than the stated number were in the package, but it wasn't enough to go through the hassles of returns and exchanges for just being 1 short.  I would recommend this, but just be mindful of what you're using it for."
4.0,Cute cute cute!  The only thing that gave me pause is I had to turn the earwires around.  Otherwise the faces were turned to my back.  Weird.
4.0,Love the earrings! I was looking for a white stylish fringe earring. Very light weight - I can wear them all day with no problem. The only issue I had is when I opened the box the thread that’s attached the earrings was very lose. Thank goodness I had white thread and I was able to sew both earrings without being noticed. Other than that they are great and worth the money.
4.0,"Was a little concern at first, thought the bag was too small, but found the stretchable material was really giving able to put in a size 11.5 shoe with no problem."
4.0,Recieved the product I had asked for which was great but unfortunately there were a few tears in the material at each end of the necklace.<br />All in all though i am very happy with my purchase and would definitely buy through this user again!
4.0,For the price it is perfect
4.0,"I've only had this watch for one week so far and really like it because it is sleek, easy to read, well designed, light-weight, and very comfortable.<br />I chose the &#34;TR&#34; model because I wanted a watch that I could use as a timer also. There are no watchband lug pins to worry about breaking because the lug bars are designed as part of the watch case. The off-set crown is a nice feature to keep it from rubbing against my wrist.<br />The only reason I do not give this watch 5 stars is because this model does not have a DATE window."
4.0,"I bought them for my husband and he likes them a lot.Avarage quality and style for me,but they are keepers, bargains"
4.0,Super soft and great for a little boy
4.0,"I love the earrings, but they are a little smaller than I thought.  Would still recommend them, looks good on."
4.0,Adorable and they haven't turned my daughter's ears green yet so I consider that a win. Removed one star because they arrived with very bent posts.
4.0,A Perfect shoe in my own opinion!
4.0,Do not look like the picture but close.<br />Worth buying.
4.0,Good quality my daughter loves it!
4.0,5’5” 140 typically size 6 medium fits. LOVE the pockets and that it could be used while breastfeeding. the top is definitely cotton tshirt material which makes it very casual. the skirt is shiny flowy and its not noticeable when you fill the pockets. (2 iphones keys etc). i do feel like you need a big bright necklace to dress it up and complete the outfit i need a new necklace!
4.0,"Very cute. Runs a little big, but not too much. My only complaint is the white part was not bright white and it's lettering is quite faded. Worked for one day of pics."
4.0,Great for what we needed. Wish thr fan was a bit stronger
4.0,Love how furry and colorful it is. I don’t like that the fur get caught on everything
4.0,Neat hat dont let looks fool you on picture the protective mask is in a zipper on top of the hat that no one will notice if your not wearing it to keep the bugs off. Where I live there is a yearly swarm of flying ants and gnats and this hat came in handy today while fishing. Was nice to not have them buzzing in my eyes ears and nose.
4.0,"I absolutely love this skull mask! It's super creepy and a little realistic looking. I wore it to a Halloween party and it was a big hit. The moving jaw is a really cool feature and makes the mask even more scary. Overall, I highly recommend this mask for anyone looking for a scary Halloween costume."
4.0,Loved it! Great quality! Just need to go up a size.
4.0,fit is a bit tight in the legs
4.0,"My mom loved these, but her ears hurt after a couple of days. She now takes them out every night."
4.0,Very nice. Love the color.
4.0,Design is pretty and drapes well.  There are several loose threads inside but you get what you pay for.  I will wear it.
4.0,"Ok cloth, you just can't use it on 24kt gold, per the instructions..I have found that most of these cloths do better after a sort of break in period.."
4.0,Supper comfy and love the style.
4.0,"It's long on my husband who is 6'2. Like it's almost to his middle thigh. So he ends up having to tuck it in. Other than that it's a great shirt, soft and very well made."
4.0,"I just wish they would have had the 33 size.... I need to shed a couple of lbs.<br />But jokes aside, these pants are great and they feel very comfortable."
4.0,The paw is made of foam cushion almost? It’s so cute and hasn’t broken either! My thighs are pretty big though and the socks do slip down even with the nonslip things at the top of them.
4.0,"These pants are super cute but really thin and definitely summer weight. The pictures imply that the floral cuff can be worn up or down, to show it or not.  However, the material is much too thin for the cuff to stay folded up, so if you want the floral band to show, you will have to pin the cuff.  I am really debating about the fit and whether to keep this size (2X) or exchange for a smaller (XL). I am 5' 1"" and somewhere around 155-160.  I wear a size US 14 (L) in most all pants and skirts, however,  according to the fit chart, I am 2X. That's quite a difference.  When I tried them on, the waistband just stretched to pull on over my hips. When I got them on,  the waist was a couple inches too loose, so the sash or a belt will have to be pretty tight, and with the fabric bunching,  they're a little uncomfortable. The length is another concern,  but I'm used to that, being short (doesn't make it any less annoying though). I will have to pin or sew the cuff up and wear them with my booties that have a small platform and 3 inch heel to keep from dragging on the floor. I would like to exchange for the smaller size XL but am concerned about whether I will be able to pull them on.  I also think the XL might be a bit shorter, but the size chart shows a measly 3/10 inch difference so I doubt that would help.  So I am very much on the fence. Also,  be aware they are hand wash,  meaning ironing probably. This is in the description but obviously I missed that. If the fit was better on me, this would be 5 stars."
4.0,Runs a little small so I would definitely size up but overall great hoodie.
4.0,Kind of cheap looking but pretty.
4.0,Pretty dress.  Just didn't fit
4.0,"I love this style, this suit is high quality.. The only reason is entirely it back was, the fit. I first order a large  and it was way to big and then tried a med which was still loose in the stomach. For reference I am 5'4 140lbs"
4.0,These are good basic swim trunks for the low price.  The style is nice.  They are comfortable.  They are indeed quick-drying.
4.0,Good colour but it's too tight around the chest.
4.0,"Not quite worth $100, but it’s a beautiful ring with a very pretty colored stone. Worn out a handful of times and seems secure enough not to lose any stones. Very eye catching and authentic looking!"
4.0,"The only thing I had an issue with was that I got the wrong color trim, but it served its purpose."
4.0,I bought this jacket to use for work! I was very impressed with it. I really like the facemask feature on it.
4.0,Like the face..... don't care for the band
4.0,"Looks cute, but I am returning because the newborn size definitely would not fit a newborn human . . . possibly a baby giraffe, but not a newborn."
4.0,"It was a gift for my mother who wanted a sun dress like garment for church. She said it fit okay, a little tight in the chest but overall okay. The blue is pretty."
4.0,My son loves it.  Loves the colors and details.
4.0,"Very nice coat, fix prefect, she loved it."
4.0,"I liked the hoodie for my son.  Beloved the graphics and fit.  I expected a more sweater, comfy feel.  It doesn’t have any warmth componente to it but living in FL it works great.  Wish it had a lining inside of it in a cotton like material.  Otherwise great buy and decent price"
4.0,The fabric has a nice feel. It moves easy and was easy to iron.
4.0,"Looks Good, Fits Well, Nice Look with jeans"
4.0,Great sleeping bad but not at all perfect for backpacking. Too large and bulky.
4.0,This was a gift for my son who says he loves it!
4.0,"Helps to keep your cables and cords in a tidy order, though it's a bit of a space eater. Still, I prefer this over leaving them loose in my case. Best part of this larger size organizer is a discreet zipper pocket in the back which I use to house my VGA/Video Adapters. Those are pricey accessories and can easily be damaged if left to run loose in your bags, so this helps store them flat out without bending or pinching."
4.0,These earrings are very nice.  Good quality.  These are for a friend's birthday present.  I would recommend these earrings.  For myself I like smaller hoops.
4.0,"These are cute necklaces and inexpensive, I got the red and black ones."
4.0,I loveed it. Wore it for my son's outdoor wedding . I'm 5'2&#34; 125lbs I got a small and it fit perfectly.
4.0,kinda tight if you have alot of hair
4.0,"I've only worn this a couple times and we aren't in the cold weather season yet.  But it isn't as warm as I thought it would be.  I'm 6-1&#34;, 190 lbs with a 34 waist and the XL was a good fit for me."
4.0,"Solid product to be honest. It's not styrofoam for those who are wondering. It's that harder but squishy foam.  My only concern is the paint job.  Done very fast with no care.  Red paint for the fire hole is partially spread on the front of the gunz smeared.  White sections overlap black sections sometimes.  Overall I like the product, well worth 30 bucks."
4.0,I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.<br />Smaller then I thought but very cute. I bought this for my step mom. Her and my father got a camper for their retirement and I thought this would be a great birthday gift to send good luck on there journeys. It came packaged very nice. The presentation surprised me it was in a decorative box inside a little plastic wrap on a necklace holder with a jewelry polisher cloth included inside. If you plan on sending directly as a gift it looks good on delivery no gift wrap necessary.  It is small and delicate not sure if it's flimsy since o won't be wearing it. Like I said I got this for their travels and planned it as something for them to hang from their review mirror in the camper. If you do plan on wearing this on your neck I would get a stronger chain. I would have given more stars if the chain was stronger.
4.0,It’s tight around the chest area and I went up a size
4.0,"This is my second shirt like this.  My only complaint is that this one did not look brown at all, but dark gray..not my color.  Gave it to my sister for a gift.  Hope they actually make this in a true brown someday."
4.0,"Since color is a major issue for watch buyers, a company should not put the phot of a new color and send whatever color they have, it is tricky if not sloppy. Returned it... Watch feels fine and good quality."
4.0,They was to big even after using the velcro all around ..just too big
4.0,"I kept this becuae it's really comfortable, but it's a tad short and won't work for leggings for me.I am 6' tall."
4.0,Great product at a great price. Allows me to change up the bands on my fitbit.
4.0,Not the best quality. Much thinner than expected and runs small. Otherwise a nice logo print and color was good.
4.0,Just basic slippers. Memory foam isn't very thick or something because it's not as comfortable as some other slippers I've owned before. Skip these if you have wide feet
4.0,suit case is nice.  slightly tippy.  I like the pattern it sticks out when getting your luggage from luggage claim
4.0,"I’m 5’5”, 160, 8in jeans,  very busty—higher than 36ddd busty. After reading other reviews I decided to get a L. Upon trying it on it was a little baggy/not tight enough to hold my chest securely in place and had enough fabric in the stomach area for me to gather/pull. Will probably get a medium and see how that fits prior to returning. The back also has no lining—the front is lined—so I imagine in water you’ll be able to see through it in the back. I purchased for carnival and will be wearing shorts over it so no problem really for me"
4.0,"Runs one FULL size too small so I had to return/reorder. Pros: current heel, almond-shaped toe, good construction makes for a sleek, cool business look. Cons: 2.5 inch heel with poor arch support, no padding. Difficult to add an insert without making shoes too tight. Used a thin, moldable insert that works. Without insert? Unwearable for me. Not worthy of original ($300) price tag but got them here for 70% off."
4.0,Crystals are flat circles instead of having jagged edges like in the stock photo<br /><br />Aside from that nice attention to detail<br /><br />Good craftsmanship having the gems inside linked diamond<br /><br />Looks good from afar without drawing too much attention<br /><br />Comes with clinch/drawstring  bag and box
4.0,Very comfortable and well worth the price. The sizing is small by US standards. I normally wear a large but had to go with an XL for the shoulders and sleeve length. I love the shirt!
4.0,They look great and have held up very well. The hinge makes them easy to put on and take off. For the price not bad at all!
4.0,"I haven’t yet figured out how not to look like a child in this, but it’s pretty good quality. The bib will look weird if you have a bigger chest."
4.0,Especially the top......a size 10 is fitting more like an 7/8 if lucky.
4.0,"Shoe fits perfect, shoe is light weight, looks great for work or casual wear. Only negative is the soft shoe sole material which doesn't last long if use for heavy work but is perfect for casual everyday wear."
4.0,"Been carrying it for a few a week or so and I carry it in my front pocket and it fits fine. The zipper is tight and I keep thinking I am going to break it, I figure it will loosen up in time. So far so good."
4.0,For the size of the backpack it’s pretty roomy. Can fit an iPad and then some. I wish there were zippers for the inside pockets. Whenever my bag tops over the contents of the inside pockets will fall out. I also wish the padded portion of the straps were a little longer. I’m 5 ft tall with thicker shoulders and the buckle to the straps come to my armpits. Though still comfy it’s not always easy getting the second strap on.
4.0,"This was actually better quality than I expected.  These are both heavy and substantial for chains.  I have noticed after wearing the bracelet for weeks, in the water as well, that is has lost some of its shine.  I wouldn't say it has tarnished, just not as bright.  I have jewelry cloths I am going to try and clean it and see if it brightens back up."
4.0,"A warning for those with guitars with cheaper finishes:<br /><br />I bought this for my pink Ibanez Jem Jr to complete the Jem aesthetic.  While the strap itself is great, the finish on my guitar was not, and decided to chip while I installed the clip lock.  I was able to glue the fallen piece back in, but it would break out every time I'd put the screw in.  I did this slowly and carefully so I don't believe it to be my own error; I'd still recommend hand tightening the screws and going slow.  I don't know too much about guitar finishes so I can't tell what the cause was.  I've put the chipped off piece in a safe place until I can figure out how to replace it /and/ put the clip lock on."
4.0,"Super cute glasses. I've had them for months now and only just experienced an issue with one of the lens coming out while I was wiping them off. It was very easy to snap it back in, however. Here's a goofy selfie I took in them :)"
4.0,"Nice, this was a gift to a very special dog Preston, he loved it, so did his owner."
4.0,I weigh 115 pounds and this dress is a perfect fit! I ordered a small. The quality of the fabric is soft and flowy and layered so that the dress is not see through. Perfect for summer!
4.0,"Beautiful when I tried it on but beware, definitely not preshrunk and I washed it on cold delicate and line dried. Now it’s a bit tight around the bust. It’s officially become a “skinny day” shirt."
4.0,"These fit ok, but they are kinda shiny and sheer. I really wanted the length and pockets, so I will wear them."
4.0,"I love, love, love these boots. I've also purchased a pair in black. FYI, they DO run large. I usually wear an 8, and that's what I ordered. They're a little big, but not so much that I can't wear them. Also, I have a high arch and wide feet and these work great. I may buy more."
4.0,"They're OK. This is the first year I have tried no show socks, so maybe I don't know how they should fit. Time will tell how they wear. I hope they don't shrink."
4.0,"I was so scared to purchase this because of past reviews but I took my time reading them and decided on a size. I'm 130lbs and 5'6, I don't have too much breasts(36B) I'm more muscular on upper body, lower body I'm also muscular with butt but I don't have much curves. I ordered a small since I wanted the bottoms to cover everything appropriately and was scared that the medium was going to feel loose. The top is definitely smaller than expected but thankfully it fit just right, the top isn't meant for excessive covering so there's a little side/top boob showing which felt normal to me. The quality felt nice for the price, the design is beautiful and the color was just as pictured. I definitely recommend this product , just take your time in choosing the size to avoid return hassles etc (: Super excited to wear it."
4.0,"Beautiful skirt, but even though I measured, it's still waaay longer than expected. I am five foot seven, and I would say that I have average length legs, not especially long or short, and this skirt is almost ankle-length on me. I'll be returning it and looking for something shorter. I expected it to be just below knee length."
4.0,"The photo shows that it has a weight on the cross base, which is NOT included!!!! You have to read all the fine details to find that out. It comes with no stakes to put down in the holes either so you just have to figure out how to keep it up without it falling over. It can NOT be used without this. We really like it, but it took my husband about an hour to drill bigger holes in the base to put in stakes we had to buy separately to keep it from tipping over..."
4.0,I like that it has it's own slip. It is a little low in the armpit area.
4.0,"Great with the zipper since I can easily wear overtop another pull-over sun shield shirt since I am so sensitive to the sun.  I wish the sleeves were a little longer since I do have long arms.  Very attractive and with the multicolor patter, it blends with most bathing suits.<br />The package arrived in a small packet that was so tight and compact, I nearly cut into the shirt to open the well-sealed plastic package.<br />I would buy another one.  Very few have a zipper which also makes it easy to take off after swimming."
4.0,It's asian size but I ordered bigger and it fits fine. It is like a spandex fabric that is very stretchy. It's a thinner fabric but makes it easy to layer up. It's one of my favorite comfy cozy shirts.
4.0,"My Daughter loves these, have to get short sleeves for summer. She has Sensory disorder and these are an amazing tool for us!"
4.0,Beautiful item however the Bee came rougher off as I was opening the case on the first try. Luckily i am a crafty person so I was able to fix it.
4.0,"I was excited to try it on, it took a while to finally get it adjusted so it wasn't sticking up. One thing for sure, it's hard to read anything ie: directions on boxes, bottles, etc.<br /><br />It could be a little longer."
4.0,I really like the hat.  It is soft.  The only problem I can find is that it seems to run a bit small even for a newborn.
4.0,I like it...just should've gone up another size.
4.0,"This shirt is cute and the color is just as vibrant as it looked online. The only downside is the material is kind of thing and clingy. Also judging on the picture and description, I thought the bottom would flare out more than it does, but it is still pretty true to size."
4.0,"This is so pretty. I would've given it<br />4 stars but the top portion runs really<br />really, really small. I'm only a 34B and had to literally squeeze into it. It flattened the little I have on top. I'll probably keep it,<br />I just need to figure out how to stretch out the top"
4.0,package arrived quickily.  two colors/two pair looks good.  doesn't move much.  thank you
4.0,The leather is pretty and the shoes are comfortable once broken in. I ordered a wide size and they were no wider than some normal width shoes that I have purchased. The toe box seemed to be the most narrow part. I heated these with a hairdryer and then wore them around with my thickest socks and they are much more comfortable.
4.0,Love the shirt. Wanted it a bit longer. I am 5'9 so would be perfect for a shorter person.
4.0,Must have small hands
4.0,Cute necklace to have for dress up  or casual.
4.0,Not bad for the price. Makes a good impression.
4.0,"I am 5'4"" and 130lbs. Ordered size M. I'm an older woman and a bit plump in the upper arms. The dress has nice coverage and is attractive and stylish at the same time. Some customers have had problems with the sleeves being a bit tight. I just took out the pleat and resewed by hand  it within a couple of minutes. The sleeves are now  very comfortable. I also decided to raise  the hem so it hits mid calf and looks better with ankle boots, or even sneakers. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. It will be nice for travel, work, and going out. Thinking of getting another."
4.0,"Feels great, looks even better, just make sure u order a size or 2 up because they run a little small"
4.0,"Overall I liked the necklace, though the chain seems to be a bit thin and not so sturdy"
4.0,Cute style. Cute packs. Not as good of quality. But good for the price
4.0,"Necklace looks good, but arrived with one leather band broken, and missing part of the leather"
4.0,I use it for everyday wear with jeans and as a gun belt. It is a fairly stiff and strong belt without being too thick. Nice heavy buckle. I did need to make the holes a little larger because the prong would not slide through them. If it lasts for a long time I'll be even happier.
4.0,"They help cut down the glare of the direct sun in your eyes.  A life saver while driving.  They are a bit small.  They fit fine over my prescription eyeglasses which are fairly small, but if yours are large glasses, they probably won't fit."
4.0,"Great material, fits really well and looks good. One thing, the buttons came right off. I had to sew them back on with stronger thread. Other than that, I think it's a great blouse, comfortable, it's casual enough to wear anywhere, but also works in work and business situations."
4.0,This looked very elegant for my daughters prom. Didn’t look cheap.
4.0,"Pretty product. Came on time. It is huge though, too big for my belly."
4.0,BARELY fits my 12&#34; MacBook the laptop slot has a zipper on the back I am concerned might scratch my MacBook (I don't have a case on it). But other than that its perfect.
4.0,Four stars because the string was in the wrong place. But easy fix. Otherwise would have been 5 stars.
4.0,"Bought these for my GF, she loves them. Very comfortable and light weight. They breathe well, easy to put on and take off. Padding seems just about perfect. Not too much, not to little. Would give 5 stars if they had more color options and had a full finger option as well."
4.0,"First of all, I am VERY happy with the pocketbook itself...the leather is amazing & the design is flawless.  HOWEVER, the &#34;Pull&#34; on the main compartment zipper came off the very first day !  I reattached it & have tried to repair this myself - but for almost $80.00 I shouldn't have to worry about this.  I'm still nervous every time I use it that the zipper pull will come off again.  It will be hard to fix permanently because there is no other place to attach the pull . . . so if I can't repair it. . . I am up a creek.  I would have given this product 4 stars if it weren't for this issue. The manufacturer NEEDS to fix this!!!"
4.0,"The color of these are great. The teal isn't quite as bright as I was hoping, which is the reason for the 4 stars. The lenses are nice, and provide excellent protection and privacy. You can hardly see through them when they aren't being worn. Fit great on my head unlike other sunglasses. They put little to no pressure above my ears, which is a plus."
4.0,I love this cuff! I've been looking for one similar to these for a long time. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the material is a lot thinner that I thought it would be.
4.0,"This top fits as expected.  The material is thin, still good purchase for price."
4.0,"This has been such a severe winter, that I was looking for something besides a scarf or a baseball hat. This hat does the job. I can wear it with so many of the coats I have."
4.0,"Thin, though nice"
4.0,"Fits great, She really likes it."
4.0,"Love this product! The skirt is great material, however the button on the front is a little flimsy, other than that, love it!"
4.0,"This is a very cute and versatile sheer kimono that can be used as a beach cover up, cardigan or sexy robe.  It’s a beautiful floral print that has ¾ sleeves and is longer in the back than in the front.  The wide sleeves are hemmed as well as the at the neck down towards the chest.  It is true to size.  My normal size is medium and it fits great.  No need to order up.<br /><br />The one I received does look a bit different than the one the model is wearing.  Mine does not have the slit at the sides but it is still beautiful no less."
4.0,love the color - the band at the bottom is very wide and reminds me of an older style (like the 80's)- probably wouldn't have ordered if I'd noticed that but kept it and do wear it.
4.0,"A nice parachord bracelet. However, you might need help putting it on quickly."
4.0,Nice quality jacket for the price. Very pleased so far.
4.0,Packaging:  I found a tinny plastic bag in my mailbox today and it took me a minute to understand that the seller did actually put the product inside. Lol. The earrings came in tinny cover(Picture attached).<br />About the product: These are about 11 mm in diameter (around 1/2 an inch). Once I wiped the earring with a muslin cloth they were shinning like expensive earrings. The earring has a click-to-close mechanism which is strong enough. Hence once you wear it I can assure that it won't open unless you attempt to remove the earrings. These are dainty and cute and fit perfectly on the ear. I can assure that these can be worn by adults as well as teenage girls. For the price I paid these are really cute and sturdy. I will update the review if I see any change in the material or functionality of the earrings. For now I am just going to show - off :)<br />Pros:<br />Shinny<br />Cute<br />Can be worn for both professional and social events<br />Nice price ( I paid $3.30 including shipping for these)<br /><br />Cons:<br />I do not see any<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because there is scope of improvement in the packaging. My earrings make some clinking sound at times and I sincerely hope it is not because of some damage to the product in the transit. However these are nice earrings and a good purchase.
4.0,"This is a review of the band with a folding magnetic buckle since there are at least 2 varieties listed for this . The band is soft and supple. That suppleness means that if you are straining the band it will likely stretch. But for a wrist about 6.5"" / 165 mm like mine it's great. There is roughly 2 more inches worth of adjustment on top of that. I knocked one star off for color misrepresentation in the photos. The picture makes it look like it's a royal blue which would have been a great color for this. The color listed is ""midnight"" blue. It's actually a Navy blue. It does look good, but it's not as pictured in the seller's description. The color in my photo is the actual color"
4.0,I do really like these earrings and I’ve received compliments on them.  I wish they were a little bit heavier.  They’re extremely light weight.  But they look pretty & are as pictured on line.
4.0,This is what I was looking for. Good price.
4.0,"Beautiful, but a little awkward to wear as they don't hang quite right, so I removed the ear hooks and put in my own. Also, I trimmed the white fringe which was much longer than in the photo."
4.0,"La máscara no es muy buena, es muy falsa"
4.0,comfortable for a great price
4.0,"These rompers are made of a blend of 60% cotton and 40% polyester.  They are not super soft, but “soft enough.  They snap all the way around the leg openings.  The snaps are nice and strong.  The abstract, asymmetrical baby dinosaur design is that “rubbery” iron-on substance, so that means you’ll need to make sure your dryer is not too hot, otherwise it can melt / crack. I have the size 6-Months, and they measure 16.5” from the top to the bottom and 11.5” across at the midsection. Unfortunately, there are tags sewn-into the neck area.  You’ll have to carefully try and clip the stiches to remove them.  Made in China."
4.0,"I ordered an XL since I know they run small. I normally wear a Medium shirt. I am a D cup and the top was way too small I ended up giving it to a coworker who is a B cup.<br />I was not surprised, I took the risk and hoped they didn't run too small .<br /><br />Overall the bathing suite is beautiful"
4.0,Nice doing business with the seller. Legit  product as described.
4.0,"Nice product for the money, very pretty!!"
4.0,"The necklace is exactly as pictured,  but extremely long."
4.0,"the velvet like fabric on it is veryyy soft. Also, the little gems around the woman's silhouette are absolutley beautiful ..shimmery and shiny! just wish it sould be tightened a little more... i have a small neck tho"
4.0,"My feet feel pretty good at the end of a work day of wearing the socks, and I don't have as much swelling as I did before."
4.0,"Pretty piece, just not top quality"
4.0,"I purchased one of these shoe horns about three years ago, apart from the fact that one of my grandchildren managed to remove the handle which was a little lose and lose it, this shoe horn has been fantastic and I would not be without it, even without its handle"
4.0,"Nice quality but the &#34;Vegan&#34; is too small to read.  I bought it as a gift for my vegan niece and she wore it several times.  I mentioned how I knew she would love that it said &#34;vegan&#34; and she had no idea it said that.  She thought it was just dotted on the heart.  Still pretty even if you can't read it, but that's the only reason I chose it for her."
4.0,Boots looked as pictured. Ordered a half size larger 7.5 then what I normally wear. Tried them on & they fit good. Have not had a chance to wear the boots yet to see how comfortable they are or how much arch support there is.
4.0,The Dress arrived in a small bag and itself it a nice poly jersey fabric. It has nice stretch without being thin which is a bonus. The Front Lace up detail is cool with the grommets. The lace up string is made of the same fabric as the dress - which isnt the nicest detail - but it can easily be switches out for a cuter tassel piece. The front slit goes to right above the knee. My only complaint is that the back zipper is too long for the shape of the dress and causes a pucker in the butt area as it extents too far down the center back seam. It isnt the end of the world or anything - it just isnt a perfectly seamless dress as I expected. It does Fit as Expected - I wear a size 12 and ordered a Large. It fits fine. - I did get this product at a slight discount for this review.
4.0,I bought these for my granddaughter.  The only thing she does not like is the laces dont stay tied
4.0,fast service beautiful charm
4.0,"This comes in a great ""locking"" case and has 2 extra different sized nose pieces. Finally goggles that know that ""one-size"" does NOT fit all.  So far I haven't had them fog up yet. I do find that they do not always seat well and I occasionally get water in them while swimming. I may also just have them adjusted incorrectly too. These have been the best yet though. Very comfortable - even after keeping them on for about an hour at a time. Worth it for comfort alone."
4.0,"Loved the design, loved the quality. Returning only due to sizing.<br />Runs really small I usually wear a 1x or 2x....I ordered a 3x just because swimming suits usually seem to run smaller. Unfortunately this one runs even smaller. Again the tankini was beautiful. Return process was easy."
4.0,Very comfy & super soft!
4.0,"I heard these run small, so I went up one size from my normal L to an XL which I meet most of the size criteria for. It fits OK, but is perhaps a tiny bit short. If you want a &#34;race fit&#34;, going up one size is probably good. If you want it &#34;roomy&#34;, better go up two sizes. The quality is fine. This is not a &#34;costume&#34;, it's a regular cycling jersey. The back has the usual 3-pocket design. Perhaps the quality is a tiny bit less than my other jerseys typically in the $80 range. But it is perfectly adequate, especially considering the price."
4.0,If you like painted on tights this product is for. I'm 235 5'7&#34; it fits and you cannot see through them
4.0,"The yoga socks came as described, and they are a good price at $22 ($5.50/pair).  The socks are a good fit and have a good amount of skid-proof material on the bottom of the sock. I realized they are a yoga sock, but I wish they came higher above the ankle.  Would recommend."
4.0,"I like this rain jacket a lot, great for the price. It's very cute. I ordered a size bigger to be safe, and it is quite loose. I do wish that the hood had drawstrings or something to help it stay on your head, it blows off your head when the wind hits it. Overall though, this was a good purchase."
4.0,The elastic band band not stay put so it ends up coming out of the cap or getting twisted which is not comfortable. Would like to see it in more colors as well.
4.0,Socks came as described. Great product for the cost. You can’t beat it. Only thing I’d change is to add some small anti-slip pads to bottom so you won’t slip. Other than that they are adorable and nicely made.
4.0,Love this sweatshirt! I sized up cause I wanted it a little more baggy. I usually wear a medium but I decided to get a large.
4.0,Can't complain for the price. My husband loves to collect currency from foreign countries.
4.0,lightweight. soft.true to sizing
4.0,Love these leggings! Just the right waist height and amount of compression.
4.0,Smaller. I usually wear size medium but this medium was too tight. Had to give it to my wife.
4.0,These sneakers are both fashionable and the comfort I was looking for.  And the heel height is so comfortable.  I am really enjoying them.  I like them so much I bought a pair in black too.
4.0,Very cute and elegant. Could dress up or casual. Simple and beautiful.
4.0,Dress is very cute and comfortable. I gave the dress 4/5 stars because the wrap style of the dress makes it easy for it to blow open. I recommend using a safety pin or wearing shorts underneath the dress. Overall happy with my purchase
4.0,Great design and they look amazing. Wishing the material of the beads was different.
4.0,Bought for a student... holds plenty and pretty strong so far.
4.0,"I first bought it in an extra large because I think these are junior sizes, and the dress was a little big, which is something a few other people are saying as well. I've decided to swap it out with a large and I think it will be a better fit. Bought it for my graduation dress and I think it will be perfect for it. Go class of 2018!"
4.0,Love this boot. Fits me a little tight in the thighs.
4.0,My nine year old likes them. They are a little too big so he walks awkwardly.  Sometimes there is a problem with turning them on but usually after few clicks they work.
4.0,So far the bag is great with one small exception.  I had to have the bag to enter the stadium where I work as the require clear bags.  I would love another pocket or two for smaller items to keep them contained.  You can see I will get a fair amount of use of the bag and that would be more convenient.  Do you have smaller clear bags that could help with that?
4.0,It's good - if one is wearing contact lenses.  Too small for wraparound Rx glasses.
4.0,Was a little shorter in the front but still going to wear it.  Its a cute shirt.
4.0,"These MEGNYA flip flops offer great arch support and have nice deep heel cups. Your feet feel supported, yet the soft foam footed cushions each step. This is  not my first flip flop from this brand, I have several pairs. One I even keep in the house and wear as slippers because they are so comfortable! This particular pair is for my teen daughter. Because of my wide feet, I require a wider strap. This bow knot style is very cute, but I found the stap to be too thin and it ran a bit narrow. It dug into my fat foot the way a string bikini would dig into back fat! On my slim daughter, they look adorable. True to size, we both wear an 8. The foot bed is perfect, it's just the strap I found to run narrow. Overall, these are a reasonably priced alternative to the much more expensive brand of orthotic flip flops. I am happy with this brand and so is my daughter."
4.0,"Works just like you'd imagine.  My test was on the bike and this was just under the helmet, so I think that helped hold everything steady.  I haven't tried running with it yet; will be taking it on the Warrior Dash in June so we'll see.  It seems like it might bounce around too much unless I pull it super tight."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:9fc09ba4752e5a3933e8edec7ecf32e4]] Nice piece sure. Delivery was fast. In like the fact that the little dials in it actually works, and not the type that's glued to the face of the watch.  The removal tool really makes it easy to take out excess sections of the strap, that is so cool. Light and comfortable to wear- not so bogous like I feared it would be when I wanted to order. The wooden case gives it this vintage look, thats a plus! The only down side is, its not luminous; would have loved if the hands and markers glow in the dark. Though I know this might make it cost a little more, but I think many people would have prefared it that way. All in all, its a good buy."
4.0,I really like this bra.  Has good support and definitely makes them look good. This bra is very comparable to my VS pink bra except that bra was twice as much on sale. I definitely recommend this bra and will be buying more in different colors 🥰
4.0,It didn’t look quite the same and didn’t have the rustic look to it but besides that i love the shirt.
4.0,"I was honestly super excited about these and then a little disappointed with the fact that they aren’t truly waterproof. They are still the best pair of gloves I have ever had because they are warm and durable, but my hands were soaking wet after using them at work today for outdoor cleaning with a water hose.<br />They are water proof with a little bit of water and probably if it was just raining, but I had direct, and a lot of water, hitting my hands and they are absolutely soaked. Still not dry after laying them out for several hours."
4.0,"great quality.  have to order a new one, sizing inaccurate!"
4.0,"I was looking for a lightweight, packable, inexpensive raincoat; this one meets all three requirements:  practically weightless, definitely packable in a nice little pouch, and very reasonably priced.  Attractive, it's not.  I expected it to look like the picture shown (trim, neat, slightly fitted), but instead it pretty much fits like a very wrinkled pink trash bag with a tie around the middle.  Just couldn't handle it and sent it back."
4.0,Probably a great slipper but not for the needs of a 91 year old. He needs to have them not come up so high on his foot and would like a tab or loop on the back so he can pull them on.
4.0,exactly as pictured.. other reviewers stated it was heavy and it is.. the two hair clips do not serve a purpose well.  the weight pull crown forward and the clips almost cause crown to stay taught... it served our purpose for our mermaid themed party
4.0,"I got these to replace my department -issued gloves that somehow ""walked away"" after our last fire. I am a volunteer firefighter in a small town department with a limited budget, so I hated to request a replacement pair. These fit as expected, seem to be well made, and the label says that they are NFP compliant. I am not an interior firefighter, so I am not sure if I could depend on them in a life of death situation if I were, but they fit my needs. I have not worn them a lot, just beginning to break them in, so I don't know how durable they will be. Would buy again, fair value decent product."
4.0,Love it even tho a spacer in bracelet was missing.
4.0,very comforable
4.0,It is a lovely dress.  Beautiful color and vintage style.
4.0,"I like the fit of this dress, the only thing I didn't love as much is the material."
4.0,I really like it. Thought it was a bit warmer material but that's ok. It does fit a bit big
4.0,These are great looking track pants.  Fits perfect on the waist but is 2-3 inches two long.
4.0,Color is great. Material is great!<br />I gave it a 4 because the rim should be wider.<br />Another 1 1/2 wider rim would make this the<br />hat of the year!
4.0,I love it same as the picture
4.0,"Pretty necklace that goes with a lot of things. Bought in the red which had a pretty pink tint. Based on the photos, I thought the chain was longer, but still like it."
4.0,"The chain is very thin, hopefully lasts long. The heart pedant is amazing and shining also good size. My mother loved it!"
4.0,Great sock but the fabric does get my skin a bit itchy.
4.0,Really good item just alittle big on him
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e384103b01073bb02e177ac4d5cb9c54]] It's a nice peace.
4.0,Really really pretty dress! My little girls look like adorable puffs of cotton candy :) The top is sort of adjustable because of the ribbon that criss-crosses the back so it can work for both my girls one who is more narrow and the other who still has her baby fat . I would just say that if you want it to look like a gown order one size up for longer length.
4.0,The black and gray ones are amaxing. The white one is see through and one must wear another tank top under it which makes it harder to keep cool during workouts.
4.0,The bags are OK for small jewelry. Many colors in The same packet. Quality is OK for this prices . Good for earing
4.0,"So far they work pretty good, the angles are perfect. Only problem I had was when I was shooting. It had a severe lag to it. Like a old Japanese video. The gun would show recoil then the bang. Maybe a glitch. Don't know."
4.0,"Quality isn’t perfect but for the price, worth it"
4.0,Fabric is soft skulls are cute
4.0,I read the reviews and ordered a size up for my daughter. She usually wears a 5-5.5 so I ordered a 6. The shoes fit but didn't leave any room to grow.  I had to return this pair and order the next size up which fit great!  Perfect for playing in the water.
4.0,Great birthday gift.....BUT the chain is a POS. The chain broke in les than a day. The clip broke along with the chain....but overall i love it...please get a thicker chain. .
4.0,"This bracelet is lovely and it has the weight and feel of sterling silver at a fraction of the cost.  Unfortunately it doesn't have a way to open and I could not get it on.  Sadly, I had to return."
4.0,Dress itself is very cute! My daughter loves it. However it’s somewhat large. The fabric is cheap but considering it’s a kids outfit and there will be mess and she will outgrow it-it’s perfect for its price and design!
4.0,"I absolutely love the color of this purse. It is a little narrow on the inside and not quite as large as I had envisioned, that is the only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars. I wish the handles were a little larger in circumference so I could more easily wear on my shoulder with my coat. Other than that I am very pleased with the look, craftsmanship and quality of the bag. I would purchase another bag from this company in the future."
4.0,It’s pretty.....not quite as much color as I expected.
4.0,"Really nice for the price, the band really don't like me, but the watch is looking good face."
4.0,Big in the cup area and I am DD
4.0,This tutu fits my 2 year old (30 pounds) perfectly and she loves wearing it to gymnastics and around the house. It is a cute design and functional for its purpose. My only con is with gentle cold wash and laying flat to dry the shimmer and sparkle of the leotard disappeared. Hand wash only is not practical for a toddler when worn in a gym weekly.
4.0,"This top is great! It looks very chic and the fabric is sturdy. My biggest issue was that the sleeves aren’t actually sleeves. They’re more like shoulder drapes, so you do have to adjust it yourself if you move your arms around too much."
4.0,Purchased for my son. Sizing is good. I often find sizing on sweatshirts can be variable but this runs true to size I think. Good quality.
4.0,"Good quality, nice fit, I have had some problem with night vision with wet roads.  These glasses did improve that situation."
4.0,Wish they had thicker padding
4.0,Like the features.  Wish that it weighs less.
4.0,The inside edges are just a bit sharp but I really like this ring. great for keeping my mind busy during meetings.
4.0,I ordered a 2xl as it said that's a woman's size 10...it was roomy for a 10.  An XL would have been better.  Kept it as it had just enough tightness to it to stay in place.  Husband loved it when I wore it on our honeymoon - had a few compliments at the pool on the cute vintage look and (as a size 10) that was pretty cool.  Very cute - and very confident boosting:)
4.0,Fit as expected. Came faster than expected
4.0,"Love the shirt! Overall fit is flowy & comfortable. The built-in bra was a bit tight, however."
4.0,Cute style everything was great except they fit supper loose on my face so I tried to bend them in and adjust them to my face so they wouldnt fall off
4.0,"Great fit love the fabric.<br />Good sized pouch<br />the hole for the pouch does seem to vary in the size of the opening, seems there is no 2 that are the same size"
4.0,Great ring altho it's starting to chip the color
4.0,"Really adorable shirt! Just a little bigger than I thought it would be, but still love it!"
4.0,Officiating a wedding where I had groom say vows to brides two children with rings making a family. It was precious
4.0,Arrived sner than expected. Fitted perfectly.i am 5'5 and 155 pound and I had a size 7. the only problemi s that it is not as blue as the picture shows and that is the color I wanted(deep blue).apart from that. It is super sexy!!!
4.0,The pearls are lovely. Just feel they are smaller than 8-8.5mm. Also the backs seem loose. A little concerned about them staying on.
4.0,"Great, just runs pretty big"
4.0,"I bought the XS because my measurements are in alignment with the XS sizing on the chart provided by the seller in the picture. I’m gonna keep the pair I bought because they fit me fine, but if I bought them again, I would bump up to a size small. They feel tailored to my body, and they look cute and they aren’t bunchy or anything, but they would be more comfy if they were slightly looser. That’s all. I love the satin fabric, it’s very soft."
4.0,They are super cute but the sun answer stars pendant has already fallen off the chain.
4.0,I buy a lot of these to work in. Normally their not a bad pair of work pants but lately the strings started snapping in half I had to return these but I will remain a customer. Defects every once in awhile is expected.
4.0,Very comfortable on the thin side but nice.
4.0,The item fit well and the material is of good quality.
4.0,"Great quality, lots of compliments.  Looks just like a big boy tie!!"
4.0,Coat keeps you warm in 15 degree cold but the hood is flimsy and more of rain hood. Good amount of pockets.
4.0,Fits more loosely than expected. Was in fact afraid when ordering of it being too small. It isn't at all. I have come to like the loose fit and flowing feel. Shoulder straps just barely long enough at full adjustment.
4.0,"Runs smaller than I thought, but is alright on."
4.0,It's as stated.  Good quality.
4.0,"I love this dress. I gave four stars because I didn't like that the pockets.  The pockets sits a little higher than I would like.  Outside of that, the dress is great. I will be wearing it."
4.0,"This dress is so beautiful, the fabric is soft and looks and feel more expensive than what it is. The only problem I had was that it was longer then what it said it was, but overall I love this dress."
4.0,This is just what you need to ease your tight shoe on.
4.0,"I am 5’6, 36C, 28 waist, 34 hips. Pant size 6, legging size small. Top size small-medium. I ordered my usual size small in this dress and I think the fit is nice enough that I chose the right size. It’s soft and stretchy and seems comfy to wear. I needed help buttoning the back neck buttons. The keyhole in the back poufs out a bit on me though. The burgundy is a pretty deep wine red color. Not sure where I’ll wear this but it’s a nice dress."
4.0,The order was well packed and arrived as promised.  It was exactly as ordered and we are pleased.
4.0,Slightly see through even with nude/white undergarments. I am 5'5 120 lbs DD small fit perfect
4.0,It won't hang like a oversized sweater but it's still cute just get a larger size
4.0,It's cute and very convenient for going out!
4.0,Good cheap buy!
4.0,I love these shirts. Only giving 4 stars because they took awhile to arrive. (like weeks)<br />Quality is good and fits as expected. I will order again.
4.0,These are cute. A decent quality for the cost.
4.0,"Overall, I like this goggle.  I'm having a little problem with the left eye, but for the most part it is waterproof."
4.0,"I got the pants for snowboarding, the bottom of the pants are almost to small to go over my boots.  but other than that they are dine"
4.0,it is way bigger than I thought
4.0,"Great bag, first one I purchased the threat started coming off so I replaced it with a new one. Price is good for the quality."
4.0,Soft fabric and just what I wanted
4.0,I love this bathing suite looks great! I order an XL but got a large which worked out even better fits perfect.
4.0,Very pretty and sparkly.  A little larger than I had expected- just for occasions that call for bling.
4.0,My daughter loved her shoes. I previously wrote the review for the wrong shoes.
4.0,"I returned this, and am sorry I did. Nicer quality than replacement bag ordered. Thought it was really nice quality, just<br />Too big, but find now that either too big or too small in styles I prefer."
4.0,Very nice couple things are for older children but overall nice party favorites
4.0,Very nice fabrics
4.0,I love both of these blouses.  1 black and 1 white.  I originally bought them for work but they are still dressy enough to wear out.
4.0,This dress is well made. Only issue is the latch at the top of the zipper tore out.
4.0,"My lady and I like the Quality of the ring, looks nice and feels heavy. We think we have ordered a size bigger than what we were initially was looking for. Mine fits but while working, it tends to slide off and bounce around on the floor. However, we love them and may have to get them sized down a lil bit."
4.0,"Not the greatest quality, but will work for what I was looking for.<br />I do not expect these to last a long time."
4.0,Maybe to large for me
4.0,Band a little stiff but loosened up after several wearing.
4.0,Nice watch just no second hand but a great everyday watch !!
4.0,Made for husky boys
4.0,"Bought these as a back up to my normal snorkeling facemask on a recent trip on the off chance my beard caused leaks around the nose piece.  The included nose clip and ear plugs were a pleasant surprise and much appreciated.  The goggles worked perfectly, sealing great and remaining comfortable at the same time.  Fogging was minimal.  Only complaint would be slight distortion of what was being viewed.  I feel this is a function of the curved lens design, more than a defect with the goggles.  The distortion was minimal, but noticeable when compared to my regular dive mask."
4.0,"it was very pretty but it runs small, order a size up if you order"
4.0,Cute. The color is not as bright as shown here . Cute nonetheless...
4.0,"Not what I thought it would be,  but looks good,and o.k. comfortable."
4.0,"It's fine. I'm skinny and tall so it is big enough to wrap around me twice, but that is expected in a big & tall size."
4.0,This outfit is super cute but because the zipper only goes down mid-way it's difficult to get our baby's legs out to change his diaper.  It'd be better if the zipper went all the way down the leg like some of his Sleep & Play outfits.
4.0,"beautiful, but big"
4.0,Its just like the original Casio wrist band......easy to change out and good fit.  Too bad they only last about two years.
4.0,"These compression hose are excellent,  but I only gave it four stars because of the long wait even with prime.  One of the zippers broke only due to a careless caretaker, and they refunded me a new pair."
4.0,"These are soft and really pretty! I’m 5 foot 2 inches and 95 pounds, not very curvy. The XS fit great. (These don’t look very cropped on me though like they do for others’ reviews.) My only complaint is the lace—it’s such a wide strip of lace, it folds over a little under the arms because there’s just not enough space. The lace is soft so it’s not uncomfortable, just a little funky looking. Overall I’m really pleased!"
4.0,"This is a very cool watch! But, there isn't a Hatsune Miku on it, like there is in the picture. It's just black, with the little dots that say the time. And that's another thing... I don't get how to read, or set the time! :0"
4.0,Shipping took awhile but very nice for the price.
4.0,Not as tight as similar brand locks
4.0,Kind of little short on my son arm don’t know if it’s the jacket or my son has long arms but it a nice jacket tho
4.0,"These are adorable...gnome with green top hat is top heavy so he tilts back, but really cute!"
4.0,"I like the shirt but it is a little small.  I listened to other reviewers about how it ran large and ordered a size down.  I am keeping it, but won't wear it until I loose a little weight.  Love the colors."
4.0,Baggier in the legs than I expected. Otherwise they fit.
4.0,"Very nice, just as good as originals"
4.0,Smaller than I thought they'd be but I do like them! At first I wasn't sure because the skull flipped backwards no matter what. When I pulled it snug through it did better.
4.0,"I was pleased with the bracelet. It was unique and light weight, I liked the the multi strains of wire. I was a bit disappointed in the bead colors; overall they were all subdued, somewhat pale. I thought they would be bold, bright as in the picture."
4.0,"I normally wear an XL (size 12/14), but everything on Amazon runs so small, I figured I'd try a 1X. It's a big big/baggy around the hips, but really soft and comfy. Seems like nice quality, so I'll keep for comfy walks, errands and chores.  Wish they came in 0X or something."
4.0,Love the dress but would have liked a little more length in front as I am tall.  Am having to get creative to wear something under it that doesn't scream it is a slip.  Since I haven't yet worn the dress I don't know how well that plan will work.
4.0,Earrings are smaller than expected but very dainty and cute. Was happy they arrived with regular earring backs but wish they would have fit better. I'll have to get other ones in order to make these work for me.
4.0,"Love the flowing material and design, but had to mend a seam that wasn't stitched well."
4.0,This is great for walks or outdoor workouts . It’s a little loose prob should’ve ordered size smaller but overall I like it very comfortable. Covers your butt has the built in hand Warmers.
4.0,"I ordered a medium and am 5 foot 8, 150 lbs. The actual jumpsuit is nice for the price, though it has a strange odor. The length is not long enough for me to wear heels, so I may have to return it. There’s also some bunching around the front of my legs and I’m worried that I may be checking every minute to see if I’m having a wardrobe malfunction, because the side without the sleeve may fall down. I think this would be great for shorter girls, but tall may not work."
4.0,"It’s ok, I’m short so it’s a bit long.  The fit is weird through waist , I’ll have to add a belt or something. It’s ok for under $20."
4.0,A little thin but pretty top.
4.0,"Nice quality, hasn't bent or broken and no discoloration after months of use! Arrived on time in a nice red drawstring bag for safekeeping later on. Bought one for myself and two for friends who also love it! Nice for keeping hair ties available at the office or when out to dinner."
4.0,The back on the black one looks a little different but its still cute
4.0,bought this for my granddaughter for a bd gift thought it would be nice for her to carry to day care
4.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors.  vibrant and very pretty.  They seem to be made well, I've only worn a couple pair so far, but I love the colors and the designs.  These are fun~  I always get lots of compliments when I wear my tights.  Queen size though, I'm 5'6&#34; and these fit me just about perfect.  I would say that these are not made for anyone who weighs any more or may be any taller."
4.0,"As a novelty , it works!"
4.0,Great products for noise protection but fit my 2.5 year old pretty tightly across the head. He has a larger head but not huge and it is tight - would be great if the top piece was adjustable.
4.0,These sit a bit higher than I wanted them too. Full booty coverage. Cute design.
4.0,Item was exactly as described.
4.0,"Not hard plastic but not rubber like I had hoped. I bought the newborn size and they are literally for newborns! Which is awesome, if you have one. But I was buying them for a 4 month old with a chubby head. Lol. So I will be saving them for the next baby to wear. They are a cool style/shape so they don't fall off the baby's head."
4.0,"Pretty lose and baggy round the breast area would have been better if cut better around the breast and under arm, bra showed. A lot shorter than expected for taller women."
4.0,Really cute shoes! Seem to run a bit small but they stretch and keep my 18 month old from slipping while paying at the pool!
4.0,Fit well. The material is a little thin.
4.0,"Good hat, good velcro... Material ages fast though. There are more durable hats out there, but for the money it is a decent hat. I had a black one, potentially the lighter colors would age better."
4.0,"This looks better than most inexpensive Black Panther masks I've seen.  In the end, we ended up using face paint instead but this was a good buy."
4.0,Not a bad jacket for the money...alittle mink oil and it will be fine
4.0,"Have not had these very long.  That being said, these are comfortable and pretty warm and, most important to me, they do not slide on the floor.  Period.  First time I’ve ever had a pair of slippers that didn’t slip or slide at all.  I deducted one star because they are not as warm as I’d like if I don’t wear socks.  But then, I’m always cold so take that as you will.  They also run quite large.  I wear a size 7 1/2 wide shoe.  Following the size chart I first ordered a medium which were way to large.  I gave those to my Mom who wears a size 9 and they fit her perfectly.  I reordered a small which fit me very well.  I do recommend these."
4.0,"I’m a man and I purchased these hoop earrings for myself. I bought size - 16G, 10mm. Indeed these are the best hoop earrings I’ve ever came across for men. HOWEVER, the post (wire that goes through the earlobe) is TOO BIG for my earlobe, it won’t even go in and through. Therefore I must send them back. The only thing this company/brand needs to do is reduce the size of the post to ensure there earrings fit properly for ALL men and women. If this company reduce the size of the post for all earrings then I would definitely by MORE of these hoop earrings. Please take notes everyone."
4.0,"Look great, fit the man I am costuming.  But they are somewhat stiff.  If you have large hands (men), these will be too small."
4.0,"Used this on the Huawei Watch with the stainless steel band. Was pretty simple to use. I've never messed with adjusting a watch band before.<br /><br />The pin that was in the remover was already bent upon arrival somehow, so thankfully there are several replacements included. Was very easy to remove the watch band pins, only additional thing needed was pliers. Didn't use the punch or spring pusher at all.<br /><br />The hardest part was getting the pins back in. Needed a lot of force, and didn't want to damage the band/watch with a hammer. Probably not how you're supposed to do it, but I reinserted the pins the opposite way, by using the remover to push them back into the band. Was tricky, but it worked well."
4.0,Great party favors for valentines treat bags for his class
4.0,"I really like this blouse. I got lots of compliments on it. After reading the reviews, I did order the next size up. I'm about 5'7&#34; and 125lbs. I usually order a medium but went with a large. It is a bit tight across the chest but I can still wear it comfortably. My only issue is the material is already beginning to fray at the sleeves. But oherwise I'm pleased with it."
4.0,Great fit! Awesome quality
4.0,"Not at all cushioned, but has a good arch support, which is why I purchased"
4.0,"Great fit, good quilty"
4.0,I like it but it does fit a little too small to where the snapback portion caves in a little.
4.0,"Love the dress.  I am glad that I bought the size up! It seems to run small in the bust, but is acceptable. I will probably order another one in red."
4.0,"LOVE!!! The fabric is light but durable. My only complaint is the size is VERY true, meaning it fits with just a tank top on underneath but obviously then is a bit snug trying to wear a shirt under it. Great buy, especially given the price!"
4.0,It runs about 2 sizes too small. Thankfully I plan to lose weight and should be able to fit in it by the time I need too. But its a beautiful dress and its made well!
4.0,Love this green.
4.0,So I ordered a small knowing that I am usually XS but it fit. A little loose but tighter than I was expecting. FYI if you like extra tight fitting clothes and you are a XS you may need to sew up a little however if you chest area is larger than a 32B you're good. All in all nice top. Good quality too.
4.0,Very nice product. I am average sized and these fit but are a little tight on the upper arm area.
4.0,Chain is quite small but not bad for price
4.0,Very easy to cut to size wanted. Feels good. No problems (day one). Buckle is a bit thick...I'm pleased with the belt and the price!
4.0,Comfortable middle effort to put on compared with other brands dislikes are the threads they get between the toes and make you get mad specially if you are in a rush
4.0,Pretty scarf. Has silver threads throughout that are not visible in the photo. Looser knit than expected. More blue than teal. Not a bad item. Just not as expected. I wish the photos had shown the item as it actually is.
4.0,Good quality fabric and the thicker straps are good. Not 5 stars because no matter what I do the straps are always twisted I’m guessing because of design and the straps won’t stay the length daughter wants. They just slide loose all the time. That can be frustrating. But the straps are great thickness and it’s heavy duty. Perfect for a kid.
4.0,Chain is a little short for taste but good quality and looks nice
4.0,"Used to add wind and sun protection on a windy 4 day backpacking trip, it helped immensely. Being ""universal fit"" they, unfortunately, do block out some of your vision and become a bit like blinders, but the sacrifice may be justified depending on where you're using them."
4.0,"The earrings are very beautiful,  a little heavy. But definitely worth the price."
4.0,"The socks are too big for my son now, but they are so cute! I cant wait until he can fit them! He doesn't even need to wear shoes with these cute socks and plus he is only 5 months! The socks say 0-6 months but if your baby's feet are on the smaller side they will probably be too big. But i would still recommend he will eventually fit them."
4.0,Very light weight and nice... Good quality fits my Apple Watch perfect Love it!
4.0,"Great product; as the detail and quality is top notch.  That being said the actual eye is more brown than green until you put in a bright light and then the color changes.  There are a number of replica products out there; wish this one had a glowing eye, or could light up or could open/close.  Besides that its a wonderful collectors item."
4.0,Would be nice to have in brighter colors to see better in a purse.
4.0,These have to be the most comfortable pair of j and I’ve ever owned.  So soft and stretchy.  I will buy more that’s for sure.
4.0,"It's just what I needed at the right price point. It fits well, It's not very heavy. Got it for my husband to leave at our son's house for when we visit. Haven't washed yet but a good coverup."
4.0,"They are fantastic for the price. They are lightweight, and a little oversized. I have a narrower face, specifically, 6'3 and 240lbs.<br />They look and feel well built, again, better than anything you will find for that price or even double.<br /><br />They are actually polarized unlike most others at this price point who claim to be so.<br /><br />You can tell when you look through a tinted window and its purple and has lines everywhere.<br /><br />Worth every penny, and cheap enough to have multiple styles and colors.<br /><br />well done."
4.0,"Nicely made and fabric is also nice..i'm 32b-23-32(98lb) and it fits nicely around my waist and the length is perfect  except, seems like even for xs size, it can only be worn by a larg breasted. My friend who's 5' 34d-25-33(102lb) fits a lil tight around her waist but perfect around her chest and she loved it so i gave it to her. Now i have to find me the same dress that will fit me perfectly but i doubt I should get it from this store. Love the dress though and made my friend very happy. So i guess i could still thank you^^"
4.0,"Good value for the price.  Large size, which is good for me."
4.0,Dry clean recommended?!  Not gonna happen.  But otherwise I love it!!
4.0,"Came earlier than expected. Good quality, I have a sensitivity to the nickel in metal and these don't irritate me at all. I would buy from this company again"
4.0,"Nice smock to work in, very comfortable fit. It is not real thick where you would get hot. It is breathable."
4.0,I like this hat it’s supper cute and works great with buns or ponytails! It was a little big and the sides went a bit past my ears but nothing I couldn’t deal with. Mainly wore it for working out
4.0,The hat was a little bigger around the rim than I thought it might be.  Otherwise perfect for Kentucky Derby party.
4.0,Fast shipping. Wish bracelet was a little stronger. Material seems like it will break easily. Overall happy with my purchase.
4.0,"They are nice, cover my eyes, let's see how they work in bright sunlight while I'm on vacation."
4.0,I was too exposed.  It did have a lot of room to move in. Good for the price
4.0,"Everything about the shell is perfect, except the hood/collar. It was just too big for me, even with my helmet on. Otherwise, it’s a solid jacket."
4.0,"I got this dress in size small.  I should've gotten it in size XS but it was not available.  The elastic on the waist should fit true to size.  However, the sleeve holes and the torso/chest area is too big and roomy.  This dress is probably suited for anyone with larger breasts.  I'm 5'5&quot; and the dress goes above my knees.<br /><br />This dress is denim-colored with thumbtack-sized white polka dots.  The material is similar to cotton and is coarse/thick but still light.  It is not sheer.  The dress is extremely prone to creases and wrinkling and will hold up an awrkward shape if not ironed.  There are five plastic &quot;gold&quot; buttons and a pocket on each side of the breast that serves as actual pockets (not fake pockets).  The threading on the buttons are loose, however, meaning the buttons might come loose if not handled with care.<br /><br />Overall a comfortable dress.  The major negative aspect of this dress would be that the torso portion of the dress is too large, leaving a gap at the arm holes."
4.0,"Very nice, lightweight, delicate scarf.  Nice accent for warmer weather"
4.0,Fit as expected. Material thinner than I had hoped.
4.0,Clearly pretty cheap. But can last if you take care of them. Aesthetically amazing. Look so swagalicious
4.0,"The dress is nice! Light, flowy, and very comfortable! The colors are a little less red and a little more fuschia but still very pretty.<br /><br />My other thing was that I can't believe this tiny thing is in the plus size?? I'm 5 foot 5 and 158 lbs and I had to get a 4X. The 4X was big enough for me. The dress seems to be made more for BUST than for waist.... But the back of the dress has a tie so that's nice.<br /><br />But seriously I love this dress and I'm SO EXCITED to wear it out!"
4.0,Beautiful and nice looking bracelet
4.0,"I loved the dress, very nice quality however it fits a little snug and I ordered a size up! Oh by the way you can not wear panties.....my husband loved the dress!"
4.0,Color of print on band could have been better. Print is upside down in my opinion.
4.0,I like that I can use it for my long braids and pull it up off my neck. It did tear after a few wears but that could be due to the fact of how I was twisting it up
4.0,Item to small return never recieve return conformation I request a size larger never recieve a reply
4.0,Very cute excited to wear when I go on my vacation
4.0,"The watch is as beautiful in person as it is in the pics. I love looking at it.<br /><br />I just wish it was battery-powered (not mechanically wound by shaking it).<br /><br />This was my first non-battery powered watch in decades (since I was a kid) so maybe I just don't remember how much winding was needed and I'm spoiled. But be forewarned that if you don't wear it or wind it every day, it will wind down fairly quickly and stop. And if you plan on swapping watches out from day to day, it'll be annoying to reset and wind the watch when you pick it back up again.<br /><br />Again - it's beautiful."
4.0,Great price. Bought a large and it looks like they are a men's large not woman's.
4.0,"This is the perfect compression shirt for me, I love the 3 different colors.  These do run small.  I returned them and reordered a larger size."
4.0,"Cute dress, good price"
4.0,I love my suit cases.
4.0,I couldn't decide between this dress and another I saw.. But just went with my gut and I am very impressed.. Could have chosen a M but L fits right as well.. Beautiful dress indeed
4.0,It’s a good deal but the little nose rings with the balls on it couldn’t fit so well on my septum or the side of my nose so just know that those are small
4.0,"this dress is heavy, I liked it but it was to long waisted for my taste."
4.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. The print, the color, the cut, everything is as pictured. Im 5'5&#34; 170lbs, wear a 36DD, medium-large dresses and 11/12 bottoms. I ordered the XL. This fit perfectly. I zipped it up no problem. The arm holes were just a bit snug. Not so snug that it's uncomfortable, but enough that I noticed. The neckline does come a bit high. You can tell my looking at the photo that it comes almost straight across from the top of your shoulders. Also, with me only being 5'5&#34; this hits about 3-4 inches below my knee. I will be having it hemmed to hit right at my knee, because that's just my preference. The material is a thinner, but solid, and not see through at all. It's a type of fabric that has a slight sheen to it. For the price point, this dress is well worth it. Shipping was prompt, but it was folded virtually flat (which tells you about the material) and in a cellophane envelope. The only down side is that the belt was folded too, which put several creases it. Im worried if it bends too much in those areas that it will crack the fake leather, so I hung it up. Overall, the positives out weighed the very few negatives. Very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"Very comfortable material<br />Well fitted, small and large<br />Warm"
4.0,I love this wallet. It is cute and stylish. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it has a weird quote on the flap and the quote makes absolutely no sense.. I didn't buy the wallet for the quote. The only other complaint that I have is that the pocket where my drivers license goes broke on the back side. The pocket is still functional and its not a big deal to me because the wallet is still very functional.
4.0,The artist rendition!
4.0,These come in whole sizes only and run on the small size. My husband is a solid 35 inch waist and the 36 is a little tight. Fabric is great heavy cotton and style is great.
4.0,"It was great quality, just way too big! I would recommend if you have a large head!"
4.0,I measured and ordered accordingly and it was still to large when I ordered it. The neckline was also higher than I expected. It was of good quality I think but I would order a size smaller than you think you need.
4.0,Good quality! Fit perfectly!
4.0,my daughter loves to wear them
4.0,"I’m getting these for Father’s Day and I think he’ll be pretty pleased with them, he is a giant dork."
4.0,The color was not right  for me. Lovely purse.
4.0,I was happy to be able to buy different colored belts at a reasonable price. I like the belts. They are well made and suit the purpose for which I purchased them.
4.0,great fun for the kids!  well worth the small price.  Only one didn't work.  Reverse the rubber band to make it more comfortable on the finger.  Makes for interesting night photos.
4.0,"It is good bag, i loved it; but the materials are not super.<br /><br />Recommended anyway but expect it won't last more than a year."
4.0,Maybe should have ordered a medium.  Haven't washed it yet so don't know how much it would shrink if  any.  Nice although material is a bit thin.
4.0,"I am 5’4, 140 lbs. I typically wear a medium in most brands but this I could have worn a small in if the option would have been available. The quality, however, is outstanding. Super heavy and durable fabric. Can’t believe the price for the quality!"
4.0,I ordered by size but it was a little small on top and had to alter but I love the dress .print and style . It's a little heavy for Arizona heat tho . I would recommend the dress tho .Just order one size up and not for hotter tempatures ....
4.0,"Fits well, I'm small on top and large on bottom, usually wear size 14-16 bought XL, and pin in the top: didn't need to this time. The dress is cute and flattering/ flirty.  I'm wearing it for a cruise. I agree the buttons are VERY loose, but I uses fabric glue and they're fine now. Also found the dress to have deep wrinkles but ironed before wearing. I do recommend wearing a short tulle slip underneath to give it a little flair. Overall, it was still a good buy, I anticipate getting multiple wearings out of this dress."
4.0,Cute bag but smaller than I was expecting. My daughter dances in multiple classes and I'm hoping all her dance shoes fit.
4.0,"I purchased 2 of these for our 7 day trip to Disneyland. They lasted about 4 days, the cords snapped and we couldn't pull them back in place. There are probably good for maybe a day trip or field trip but not for more than that. We didn't even have heavy stuff in ours and they busted. They did seem to work for water resistance."
4.0,Good size and well made. Sturdy straps
4.0,The part where the end is melted together is rather stiff and sharp. It will scratch your skin and make you itch.
4.0,Super cute and comfy. Looks a bit like PJs but I love it!!!
4.0,good all my friends think they are wicked swag and block the sun really really well so ya buy these
4.0,I’m almost 5’ 4”. 210 and  XXL. Is very tight in the waist
4.0,I like it but the stone is to big. Very pretty
4.0,Pretty but the tray doesn't have any depth. The glass sits right on top instead of fitting into the tray.
4.0,I really really wanted to love these shoes. I am sure they are great for most people.  I have had several foot surgeries over the years and now planter fasciitis. With that said this maybe why shoe is nor comfortable for my foot. Also I believe it's a little big. They fir much better when I wear socks but the whole idea for me was a simple slip on shoe for the house and no socks. Love that they had two different shoe inserts.  Love the look of shoe as well but this one will have to go back. My feet are not happy in them. Arch does not seem to hit at the right area. Afraid to buy smaller size and have similar issues.
4.0,I've only worn this once but it seems to be good quality and it fits me well. My only complaint was that there was some string in the sleeve that needed to be cut but it's not a big deal.
4.0,This bra does it all! The lift is perfect! It gives so much improvement to the look of my old lady breast.
4.0,"As stated in previous reviews the material is thin so wear good under layers. It fits damn near perfect, the skirt is a tad snug but that's expected with me since I have wide hips. I'm 5'5&#34; and 130lbs for reference and I bought the &#34;one size&#34; top and skirt combo."
4.0,The necklace is a little shorter than I expected but the quality in the charm itself is really good.
4.0,"i like the watch, the face is a little large but i have a very small wrist. it fits well overall."
4.0,Nice stylish glass..it's a pretty rose glass goes well with purple n dark pink tops
4.0,Great product / price
4.0,Order the exact size you wear.
4.0,"I’m 5’2” and the small was a bit longer than I wanted. The bottom skirt part flares out (like an “A”) too much for me - I wish it was cut to appear straight down. It makes my hips look too wide. Luckily, I sew, so I can make this adjustment to make it more narrow. I was a little disappointed in how wrinkled it was after a first wash, but my trusty iron will handle that. Overall, a cute and inexpensive outfit."
4.0,"The color is just as the picture, it is smaller than in the pic but for fall it's ok. Measuring about 4 f..Like it !"
4.0,"I wear a size 14/16, got 2x, have enough room, nice stretch material, not thrilled with the button hole being closed and the metal adjustments have to be placed. Should have come with an instruction manual. Ov"
4.0,"Liked this shirt a lot. Easy to wear in Texas heat. Very light, flowy, and breatheable. Gave it 4 stars, bc I noticed, not initially but still during my first wear, some loose threads. I will be hand washing this."
4.0,Super cute but pretty cheap quality. Don't buy unless you're only planning to wear 1-2 times for your IG pictures.
4.0,"I should have known by the picture that they were short in length, comes barely up the ankle.  They are comfortable and I will keep them and wear them.  If I order them again I will get the larger size."
4.0,"I really like this band. The only reason I gave it four stars is because there is nothing to hold the excess strap at the end of the band once it’s on. I had to put Velcro on it to strap the tail down. For a $24 Apple Watch band, I shouldn’t have to do that. Other than that, it’s great."
4.0,"Got an XL. I like the pattern, its comfortable and cute. I would prefer more space around the neck though. It has a high low hem and ties on both sides. Grab one if you need a new cover up."
4.0,Nice color but runs really small.
4.0,They are exactly what i was expecting but since it was junior sizes it looks a bit big.
4.0,The boots were exactly what we expected. Would definitely order the same brand again.
4.0,Great style and price.
4.0,Adorable. A little larger than expected but would fit an average 4 year old for sure. My kiddo has some room to grow.
4.0,"When I had received the product It was well engraved, all of the signs and symbols were present as it was in the image provided. I read on the page before ordering that it was a hallow piece, where the other side is concave in its shape. What I noticed when handling it was that it was thinner than what I was expecting. I am afraid that this piece could get bent very easily if you are not careful with what the pendant itself contacts.  I wish that I could rate the product in different sections rather than a 1-5 star  overall basis. It is a beautiful piece which all things carved into it are accurate and for presentation I would give 5/5. It had no scratches or any type of damage upon arrival 5/5. In thickness of what I expected I would give it more of a 3/5 because of how thin it is with its concave shape. I do hope this review does well with others. I am ultimately happy with the product."
4.0,My mom really liked it. She says it is very comfortable. She wears it all the time.
4.0,Lovely color. Fabric is a little thin.
4.0,"Great fit. Athletic fit 5’11 190 lbs. only issues are the buttons. They are sewn into each side without gaps for unhinging. I cut off the buttons and it looks great but I bought the black, lake blue and yellow and only the b and y came without button slots. The black looks and feels great. Great shirt."
4.0,I lost a few charms. It’s hard to try and fix so I don’t wear it. But it’s very cute I love it. And it sounds like a bell as u walk.
4.0,"Ii am 5' 7&#34; and the dress is very long. Great fit, I wear 14 and got and XL"
4.0,It was delivered just in time!! Loved it!! The fit was right on...My grandson looked adorable!!!
4.0,I liked this excel for the turtle neck part. The sleeves have a slit in them that make it cute. I bought it for a festival but didn't wear it. It's 100% see through
4.0,This was a soft summer dress. It looks very good on me. Im about 5'3 and 185 lbs. I would order again in other colors.
4.0,"Very small watch, looks cheaper in-person.  But the price is cheap, so what can you expect?  Will make a nice accessory for run."
4.0,"I didn’t think I would have liked the rimless style of these Berufexp sunglasses but they have changed my thinking. Each lens is blue light blocking, including the clear lens. This was tested by using a black light that activated a blue light indicator. Instructions were not included to tell how to remove and replace the lens but it was fairly simple to figure out using gentle force. Also, there is a picture on Amazon which shows how to open and close the clip for removal of the lenses (I didn’t have my phone at the time to see this but just so you know.) I just gently tugged a little around the front of the lens and figured out that the rubberized tip above the nose bridge pops down to release the lens from the holder. I was also surprised to see that the entire lens piece flips upward (like those old-school flip-up sunglasses.). The adjustable nose piece helps a great deal because I don't have a large or high nose bridge so sunglasses tend to rest on the rim of my nostrils or sit too close to my eyes. I can still feel the lens on my nose but it's not an irritant. During sweaty conditions, the glasses do tend to slide around a little. I just clean my nose bridge and keep on going. The frames are comfortable and very lightweight. They do not sit heavy on my face or my ears. The lenses are so clear that I forget I’m wearing sunglasses at times. When changing lenses, you will have fingerprints. The included cloth does not want to slide across the lenses. It may be the coating on the lenses. I use the included cloth to handle the lenses and provided my own cleaning cloth. The hard shell carrying case is nice as well. I do have trouble, at times, getting the lenses back into the foam slots. It takes a few extra seconds to get the sunglasses positioned properly in the case but I know the foam is there to help protect the lenses. I’m satisfied with these sunglasses. I use yellow and blue lenses the most. I think it’s a great product for the price."
4.0,"My baby is 9 months but typically wears 12 month clothing. This outfit is a little large on him, however, I don't want to get the next size down because it was really hard to get on him. The fabric is pretty stiff. It's cute though. It'll work!"
4.0,"My granddaughter hasn't worn them yet, but it looks pretty strong. Very cute."
4.0,"This top was very cute on and fit me well. I’m 5’-4” 130 lbs. I typically wear a small in tops and this fit true to size. The fabric has enough stretch to make it comfortable to wear, but not enough to make the small fit when a medium is needed. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because it could have been 2”-3” longer and been perfect. I don’t wear petite sizes, but I’m not tall either. I wore high waisted pants with a skinny red belt and was able to tuck the top into my pants. If I had worn low rise pants or mid rise without a belt, the shirt would not have tucked in. The colors and pattern are as shown in the pictures and the red is a true red. I got several compliments on this top,"
4.0,"Fit's just fine.  So durable, will last me for a long time."
4.0,"These glasses do help with night driving glare.  It’s not startling as ""wow-what a difference"".  But it is noticeable.  We leave them in the car so either driver can use as needed."
4.0,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE these pants. They, however, are in no way “high rise”. They are definitely a low rise pair of pants. They look great though and seem like decent quality for the price."
4.0,Beautiful and impressive.  The only negative is the part that goes around your neck does hurt a bit.  It is worth the discomfort.
4.0,"These are good, just too short. I think I picked the wrong size so it’s my fault."
4.0,"I normally wear a US small, I have purchased Asian clothing before and learned that a US Small amounts to a Asian Large, so I ordered the large and it was still too small, tight everywhere.. I asked to return them and the seller contacted me and resolved the issue immediately and to my satisfaction.. I like the design and material and I just purchased them again, only this time in extra large, l figure it will fit perfectly after one wash."
4.0,"Looks just like the photos.  Fabric is great, won't show dirt and easy to clean.  I wish the inside wasn't black - can't find my stuff inside and had to put some red tape on my wallet and other item so I can easily find them!"
4.0,"Love it. The fabric is soft, sweatband is great. Beautiful. Highly recommended. I bought 2 sets already. I’ll buy more. Need more designs, though."
4.0,Mix and match. I can wear with anything love them.
4.0,I purchased the xs hoping that it would hug to my skin and be comfortable at the same time. If you wear small get the xs. These dress are absolutely stretchy and will compliment your figure. The material is soft and easy to slip on. I would recommend these to any occasions.<br /><br />Downside: the lower half of the skirt is not tight enough to hug my figure. It opens up and feels awkward. Otherwise it would be stunning.
4.0,"I love the color of this top & it’s very warm. Great for a cold, snowy day!"
4.0,"They could have more compression and be slightly thicker, but these are a good deal for some nice tank tops. I'll never wear cotton ones again despite how ""moisture wicking"" they advertise to be. I often wear 2 of them for more compression for daily wear/working out, and 1 for around the house and yard. I'll continue to order more. The ones I ordered a year ago are still in great condition."
4.0,"Cute outfit. I am 5’11” size 6 and got a medium and it fit perfectly. It’s. Little short on me, but that comes with being tall. Nice quality and very sexy."
4.0,"I bought two of these in an XL. The band across the top lays above the bust and was tight.  These are not made for ladies with a larger chest.<br />Unfortunately I had to return them.  They are well made, not sheer.<br />I normally wear an xl to 1x depending on the cut."
4.0,Pretty awesome shirt. Loved the design
4.0,"These pjs are comfortable, although not as loose as I prefer in the shoulders."
4.0,"I was skeptical because my girls are on the bigger side.  I’m a C cup and I’d def go up a cup size if buying again but the C cup worked.  Stuck these bad boys on and clipped the center.  The adhesive lasted.  The girls behaved and stayed put for 12 hours!! Overall very happy.  Gave me support in a backless dress.  When it came  time to remove them, the adhesive was still strong.  Put the plastic back on to wear again.Buy them"
4.0,Liked the way it looked.
4.0,"I wanted a pretty, warm winter hat that would look good at my age, and with short hair.  Ladies with long hair always look pretty in hats, but not always for short hair.  This one does the job for me.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is I ordered the black and wish I had ordered the white, with my native American skin tone.  This black with little white streaks is pretty and I am very happy to recommend it.  Doralyn"
4.0,"I wear this dress to work with a nude heel or wedge. It's a great simple dress. However I didn't realize the front of the dress split and overlaps. I do safety pin the front of the dress, otherwise a breeze will blow it open."
4.0,I liked it more
4.0,They are very nice but run a bit big. I'd suggest ordering half a size down.
4.0,I really love mine. I wear it to work and to church. It's surprisingly very classy!
4.0,it's ok but not so spectacular
4.0,"It's not the shiny color as shown on the picture, but still a nice blue. Pants are a bit baggy rather than slim fit. But I'm a slim guy so I knew Ivwould have to alter it. Delivery was speedy especially with it coming all the way from china. The vest and Tie are a very clean white, not cream as picture shows, imo is better to me. Update: after custom taper, I loved it! Many compliments after my wedding!"
4.0,"I would have given 5 stars but it was too large,  even after I measured twice to get the right size.  I'm 5'5"", 125lbs. I like it enough to get it altered."
4.0,good quality but they are not comfortable if you are working stand for many hours.
4.0,"Cute pattern, but fits awkwardly on the top half. I got this to replicate the $80 maxi dresses that Stitch Fix carries, but you really do get what you pay for. The cut on this dress just doesn't compare to the higher priced dresses. Either way, it is still a cute pattern and works well with a cardigan or jean jacket."
4.0,Loved how soft they were and fit great. Only downside was the green was a little too thin/almost see through for me.
4.0,"You can order your true size, no need to go up a size, because the  fabric is very flexible and forgiving. I like my shirt and received numerous compliments on how I wore it👍👍👍👍"
4.0,I bought the mask because it was different. It is very cute mask.  I use the mask everyday.
4.0,just was not the right size for the womens
4.0,Really like them although I think they run a little big.
4.0,"a bit too short for a tall person (I'm 5'9&#34;) with a normal length torso and it was a bit uncomfortable. may have stretched out a bit when wet, but I returned this for another option."
4.0,A nice watch for the $ with prompt delivery.
4.0,"As soon as I pulled the dress from the package it ripped. The material is thin and the dress is far too long for my 5&#34;3 frame. Design is great, luckily I have a sewing kit so I was able to wear it once for the event I needed it for.<br /><br />*** Update<br />Seller is accommodating & cares about the product and item. They made every attempt to ensure satisfaction."
4.0,Comfortable for the most part. Good swimsuit for the money!
4.0,These are all individual bracelets so you can wear as many as you like! Was the perfect accessory for my outfit.
4.0,I bought as a gift and I think they liked it.
4.0,"Color is great, but fit more like a 1x instead of 2x that I purchased, it’s still wearable though.  I suggest if you have wide hips/thighs with some butt to order a size up."
4.0,Very comfie support hose. But mine woreout after i wore them 5 times.
4.0,"I bought this for a resident I worked with and she loves it. It fits perfectly, not to tight."
4.0,"I purchased these earrings because I love big, different earrings. When these arrived in a nicely packaged little box, I was so excited! Upon opening them, my excitement slightly dwindled. I felt like I could barely touch them because they were so delicate. They are made of something that feels like paper ribbon, almost a thin straw material. I wore them out that day and got TONS of people giving me compliments on them. I would recommend these to people who don't have small kids and can be delicate with these earrings!"
4.0,"GREAT colors, perfect size, fair price."
4.0,"Cute kitty on the front, but the pink shirt is a little thin and it runs a little small.  I was still able to wear my usual size, but I like my shirts to fit a little loose, so I should have ordered the next size up.  I also have to wear a tank top underneath the pink one if I wear it in public.  With that said, the black t-shirt does not seem so thin & I do not need to wear a tank top under it.  I really like the black t-shirt, very cute!"
4.0,Nice light weight jacket
4.0,"Nice hat, fits well and is comfortable...definitely recommend!"
4.0,"Pros:<br />Awesome details,inside the ring and on the outside.It’s the perfect weight on the finger.Much faster shipping than it says to expect,about a week.<br />Cons:<br />Order a ring size larger than you need.The ring comes from China and their ring sizes are a size smaller than normal.Their size 10 is really a 9.Had to re-order my ring for this reason.Got my new ring with zero hassle and a little quicker the second time."
4.0,"I was a little disappointed to find no pattern or design on the back side of the pendant, but my son loves it anyway. Made for a perfect “just because” gift."
4.0,Comfortable and tts- did not shrink in the dryer and kept it’s colors.
4.0,These pants have a lot of stretch. Pack easily. Size down.
4.0,"Super cute, however it runs small."
4.0,"after much debate and weighing in  the other reviews i read, i went with the large. I am glad i did since the size charts were conflicting . It's almost just right, loose enough that a good belt can easily fix up. I would have given it 5 stars but after the third wearing, the button came off but with a few stitches and lengthen the button hole a bit, made everything all good"
4.0,"looks nice; a bit smaller than I imagined,but still OK"
4.0,Very nice and it's just as it was describe.
4.0,It is a very cute skirt would recommend and very good quality for the price the skirt is soft and does not irritate my skin I love it!
4.0,"Love fit, style, and size fits as described."
4.0,It's a great shirt but the only reason I am not giving 5 stars were the price.  It's definitely not worth $40. Over priced for the simple tshirt.
4.0,I got an xl and it fit really cute on me
4.0,"Comfy. A lil small, but kinda expected that. I wear an 11.5, ordered the 11-12 size. If you're anything bigger than 11.5 I'd go with the next size up. Overall warm and comfy though."
4.0,Beautiful mask to wear when dressing up.
4.0,"The construction is great and i LOVE the material. So silky soft, but sturdy. Decent price. I ordered the largest size they offer. I really wish it came in a slightly bigger size, it just barely contains me/there's some muffin boob. (I think I'd need a size 40 D)"
4.0,This was a gift for Christmas.  It was tiny and delicate but did not have any pink color that I could tell.  I expected it to have more color.  I went for a more expensive price hoping to have a better quality stone and color.  I maThe rose quartz had no pink cy exchange it if I think there is a better choice available before the holiday.
4.0,Pretty ok watch for less than 20 dollars
4.0,These are not shoes They are SUNGLASSES
4.0,Very dainty and pretty. Very happy.
4.0,"I had no issue with these sunglasses on vacation. I wanted an inexpensive pair that I wouldn’t feel bad losing/breaking. But that was NOT the case!! I did take care of them as much as I could and although I took them in the ocean, I made sure not to completely submerge them. When water got on the lenses I would wipe off and didn’t have a problem. They felt comfortable to my head. They are an all plastic construction and do feel like they could break/snap somewhat easily if not careful but after a week long cruise I had no issue and will wear them on the next one."
4.0,Good purchase - slightly smaller than expected - reordering
4.0,Got the medium width but they fit more like a wide.  Seem like a good quality shoe for the price but the insoles are a joke.  Much better now that I added a pair of Dr Scholl's inserts.
4.0,"I haven't used the towel yet, but it isn't as soft as I expected. If I were to feel this in the store I probably wouldn't buy it. However, the size is perfect, it's cute, the price is reasonable and feels like it is good quality."
4.0,"I love this shoe! It's my favorite shoe buy off of Amazon. the only thing is that it runs a bit small. I ordered a size 9 and my big toe was right at the tip. I would have gladly returned it for a bigger size, but they are out of stock of size 10 which is really sad because I truly love these shoes. Definitely worth the purchase for the price and hopefully they can notify me when they have certain sizes back in stock."
4.0,"This looks and fits exactly as shown in the image. Nice knit, not too thin and not too thick, perfect weight and quality. A really pretty light charcoal gray. A high, attractive turtleneck to cover wrinkles or keep warm and toasty during the colder weather.<br /><br />I'm 5' 2"", 122 lbs, with a decent sized bust and chose the large size which fit perfectly and did not shrink in the dryer. This lost a 5 star rating because of two things. 1.) No tag at the neck to identify correct positioning. 2.) The front, center seam was very slightly serpentine in its stitching and so looked incorrectly sown. I turned the back to the front - it fit and looked great (positioning the inside tags at the hem area to be on the left side while wearing). As the seam stitching at the neck is disguised by the ribbing of the knit it could not be easily noticed that I was wearing the poncho backwards, though if one was REALLY paying attention they would be able to identify the seam.<br /><br />I will definitely be wearing this out and about from September to April here in the northeast, maybe adding a pin or long necklace to glam it up a bit."
4.0,"Va-va-voom. Got a lot of compliments wearing this at work. Seems well put together (just like me, haha) and is very flattering to an hourglass figure."
4.0,Fyh
4.0,My grandaughter loves this!!!
4.0,"Great piece,  but I had to pry the bale open to put my chain through, not a problem, just strange, also that part was tarnish"
4.0,"For the price, this is a good buy. The material is more like a plastic then a canvas material."
4.0,"It firnas expected, EXCEPT for the sleeves. They were roomy, but small around the wrists. It gets stuck on my watch every time.<br />It's a good weight fabric - works well for Fall and Spring."
4.0,"these earrings are so simple and cute. they are cheap and he backing bends easily, but if you don't mess with them too much, they stay in. the picture is of the bigger size earrings"
4.0,"Bought for a 3 week trip to Europe, I was tired of the old kit that I had and having to dig through it to find what I needed.<br /><br />This worked well, is well made and nicely laid out.  There are a few things that I would change but that is just a personal issue that would not work for everyone.  The only problem that I had was it is much bigger than I thought it would be.  If they had a small size..."
4.0,"These shoes are very cute. I would have given 5 stars if they would have had better arch support, but I'm older so that thing really matters now. If I was younger, it would be okay. Anyway, super stylish and cute. dress up or down with them!"
4.0,They're great for what they're supposed to do. My shirts are tucked in all day. But I have to say that they become loose after a few weeks of use.
4.0,Comfortable dress to wear.  Is somewhat adjustable due to the overlay/apron.  The under dress is very sheer but the addition of the blue apron makes it perfect.
4.0,"Love the color, fit is pretty accurate, wish the length was just a little bit longer."
4.0,The product is functional.
4.0,"I love the dress. I normally wear a large but this large fits like a smedium, its tight but I still like it."
4.0,Seems like item was tried on or stored in a place that didn’t keep it clean.
4.0,"Be very cute, but it really small. Glad I bought a 2t for my 12 month old! Pants will fit at 2 years, because t shirt is a 12 month size"
4.0,Great shoe love the color and style.
4.0,It was shipped quickly. It is very nice quality. Great Job
4.0,"My daughter asked for ""a real princess dress"" for Christmas, as opposed to costume dress up ones we have. I ordered this. She light up when opening this gift and has said its her favorite gift she received. She uses it simply for dress up and it suits our needs.<br />I will say the zipper slips down and the bow is safety pinned on. Nonissue for us, but I think that is good to know if you are planning to use for a special event."
4.0,"The colors on the robe are vibrant and pretty and it has a soft feel. I knew from previous reviews it would shrink upon washing and drying and it did. I was glad because it was a little on the large side for me but if you don’t want it to shrink down I would suggest washing in cold water and hanging to dry. I was a little disappointed because although there are loops for a belt to tie around it on the outside, mine was missing the belt. I can easily make one with some ribbon or fabric but would have been nice if it would have been included."
4.0,Love this little bonnet for my baby. Fits perfectly
4.0,Small and compact. Nice coin area.  Holds quite a bit. Leather feels good in the hand.  A little small for my needs.
4.0,Cute!  Daughter is 5'8' and got the small.  Length is intended for a teen.
4.0,Inside zipper broke the first time i used it. Need stronger zippers
4.0,I love it feels good on and it’s lit
4.0,I love them it look same areal diamonds
4.0,The bracelets look just like the picture. They are not too bulky and have a cream/pinkish hue that will compliment my blush colored bridesmaid dresses. I wish the pearls were of a higher quality but for the price they are worth it. The clasp and chain look a tad cheap but this will not show in photos.
4.0,"I absolutely love this belly button ring! It is SO CUTE and covers my entire navel like I want. I've only had it in for a day, so idk how well the little hanging moon will hold up and last, but for now.. I am loving it! I may take some pliers and just reinforce the ring that the moon is hanging from so that it won't slide off one day lol. But it is perfect! Buy it 😁!"
4.0,"These are ok shoes. They are really stiff, but hopefully breaking them in, will help with that. Also they are pointy, which does not really show in the pic."
4.0,Got this for my 9yr old and it it just fitting now. Runs a little small. I would size up.
4.0,Me agradó mucho el modelo y el tejido con que fue confeccionado.
4.0,Outstanding watch! Came in 3 days & everyone so far has asked about it. They all cannot believe the price. Great overall watch.
4.0,Since I developed a love for owls they seem to have started nesting there. This guy joined a pair of owl earrings who nest there and they look remarkably alike. I did have to change the chain just because that is what I prefer. The only problem I have really had was when I was wearing my owl necklace and bent over to pet my dog. My owl and my dog's eyebrows met with a resounding thump. The owl was fine but I think my dog had a pretty bad headache for a while. The  owl is a pretty heavy guy.
4.0,"These DUCO Polarized Sport Sunglasses were delivered on time and in perfect condition.<br /><br />I got these sunglasses for my husband who works outside.  We live in the southwest so it is pretty much ALWAYS sunny here so he uses sunglasses daily.<br /><br />These glasses come in a great case.  The case itself is a hard shelled protective case.  It zips closed and has a carabiner attached to it so you can clip it to different things.  This case keeps the glasses from being damaged.  The glasses also come in a drawstring bag.  The bag is made out of material you can clean the lenses with.  There is also a lens cleaning cloth included.<br /><br />These glasses are light weight and fit on my husband's face really well.  They don't slip and they don't irritate his ears or his nose in any way.  They are wrap around to maximize the coverage from the sun.<br /><br />So far he seems to really like them.  They are easy to clean and easy to pack with him because of the case.  Overall he is very happy with these glasses.  The only thing he would change is they feel a little wobbly.  Not the sturdiest glasses, but they really protect his eyes.<br /><br />**I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.**"
4.0,True to men’s sizes!
4.0,This outfit was long. I had to take it to a taylor for alterations. Otherwise it’s a nice outfit when you wear it with a belt and matching shoes.
4.0,High quality and amazing for the price.
4.0,Size and material
4.0,"It's quite cute, my only issue is that the material is super sheer (I have an olive complexion, and my skin shows through the material)."
4.0,Very nice but too big
4.0,Okay but try and go a size bigger if you're small but thic.
4.0,Fits well. The fabric is thin.
4.0,Good quality sweater and dusty white hem. 5’3” 135. Small top side and purchased a medium and it fits well. Not snug at all. Maybe a little roomy out of the package. But I like the way it fits. Hoping it holds up in the wash. Definitely a hang dry. Buttons on th front and back of the neck to give the collar a snug finished look. Great with boots or ballet flats.
4.0,Compression is pretty good with these but they are perhaps better for winter time. A bit too thick and warm for the summer.
4.0,"El pulover un poco grande y el pantalón un poco corto el tiro y el elástico abajo aprieta demasiado, tiene buena tela pero no es tan cómodo"
4.0,Love how it match the picture!
4.0,Cute and comfy - Perfect for a cover up or running errands on a hot day!
4.0,The pads are a little weird fitting and take adjusting but these have great support
4.0,Okay quality but the size runs small.
4.0,"Good quality, but loose around the thighs"
4.0,"I got these as costume glasses, but really enjoy them on a regular basis"
4.0,Cute belt it will go well with a jumpsuit I purchased
4.0,Nice fitting blouse
4.0,Love it looks exactly like the picture
4.0,dress is super pretty and just as pictured!! only thing i disliked is how it looked on my body lol i’m built like a door
4.0,Very cute got for my daughter for Christmas.
4.0,"Fits my moto 360 perfectly. The black finish does wear off a bit if the band rubs against your pants, etc. Looks great otherwise."
4.0,Was a little snug for a 3x but very comfortable and great quality.
4.0,Gloves are a little tight and touch screen feature works on occasion. But not bad overall.
4.0,"Great variety of colors and the small round container is great for storage when not wearing. The studs are a little flimsy, but a comfortable option for my lip piercing. I haven't been wearing mine for very long, but haven't had any problems so far. PRIME shipping is a HUGE plus."
4.0,great well made bras. the only reason i rated 4 stars is because 1 bra out of 6 had the hooks cut off so i had to throw it away. but the fit. the cups are just a touch to big but seriously for the price its a great buy.
4.0,"My industrial is at an angle so this jewelry, however cute, does not “sit” correctly when worn. You need to have an industrial that goes straight across your ear for maximum cuteness and display."
4.0,"I've had this vest for about two weeks now. Comments I've read about about the vest from other users is that it is tough removing. It takes a little work but there is a reason for the vest to be be so snug; I have no reservations with this. I do, however, feel that the vest needs more material on the should straps. The vest displayed on the advertisement is lacking material on he shoulder straps. It fits more link a loose a tank top, and I have a 42 inch chest with a 34 in waist."
4.0,I wish I had bought one size down for a snugger fit but if you like a non-snug fit then you’ll like the regular size.
4.0,"Super comfortable and comparable to &#34;that&#34; popular brand out there. My only complaint is the waistband, it would be more comfy if it were a yoga style. It's just elastic which isn't the most flattering."
4.0,Awesome watch...I only wish the link was stronger.
4.0,Fitted good but needed to be trimmed
4.0,This is a nice set. The earrings did not not hold up as long as I think they should have. The necklace did.
4.0,Really cute but leaves a stupid red mark on my nose. I have a big nose so I can't blame the sunglasses though.
4.0,"I'm a little disappointed with the thickness of the fabric and the inside lining isn't very soft, otherwise I like it a lot and it's comfortable. I would recommend buying a size up I usually wear size XS but I bought a medium and it fits well. Only other complaint is that my 8 1/2 feet are a little too big for the feet of these"
4.0,Beautiful locket. I bought 4 for myself and 3 other family members. The only thing I would change is the length of the chain. It's very long and will either have to have it shortened or get a shorter chain
4.0,"The band seems to be made well, however the pins provided are too short. We had to use the ""old"" pins to attach the band."
4.0,"As suggested I ordered a bigger size. I usually wear a US medium, but I ordered a XL in this suit since Asian sizing tends to have way insufficient bust room for me. If you're tall or long-waisted or very busty, this suit will be difficult to wear. It is definitely scaled for smaller people. I'm 5'3&#34; and 140lbs. The suit is really cute on. The good news I guess is that for us short people who tend to have problems with 1 piece suits due to them being too long in the waist/saggy tush... that doesn't happen with this one! My small gripes are the little bra pads (I plan to replace them-- they're just awkward) and the tiny elastic band thing that holds the two sides together beneath the bust (gonna replace that with something stronger for sure)."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, but it runs one size small."
4.0,Just have to make sure all the O rings are closed or it will fall off.
4.0,"Dress looks as shown which is great.  I usually wear an adult women's M & that is what I ordered.  However, this dress was way too big.  I have just ordered the small to compare.  If small is too small then I will return the small & get the medium altered which may cost more than the dress costs but I do like the dress.  I'm hoping the small fits correctly so I can return the medium."
4.0,"Fits like a glove! 8.5 size for me, touchscreen is flawless you don't have to press hard on the screen, just glide your finger and you should see what I mean!. (Fallow your palm measurements for your size)"
4.0,"Love the dress, fits beautifully. The rouching on the stomach hides some imperfections but I wish it went down even further. There is a seam down the middle of the lower front of the dress that isn't ideal, but not really noticeable. Very flattering and hits me right above my ankle. I am 5'5 250lbs and a size 18 and this fit me perfectly"
4.0,I like the fabric. Not bad for the price
4.0,"I'm not sure what I expected exactly, but it's nice and fun. I like it."
4.0,Good quality fabric and design. The color is exactly as pictured. This style apron is great if you dislike things around your neck.
4.0,Love the spring hinges and HD lens.  The look of them is current and fashionable in addition to being very comfortable.  Seem to be very well made and a good value for the purchase price.
4.0,"I was tempted to give this 5 stars but ultimately decided on 4 since perfection would have been for them to have had side pockets.  They weren't at all what I was expecting but I was pleasantly surprised  The material was softer than I expected and for a 6' ft, 170lbs woman, I love that the fabric has some stretch to it and hugs my curves a little.  Would order again. Hope they hold up!"
4.0,"This watch seems great! Good quality, nice big face. Unfortunately- and I am aware that this sounds ridiculous- I'm a really androgynous woman and with the black wristband this watch is chunky and bold enough that it reads as masculine. People think I'm a dude more often when I wear it, lol. Probably not an issue for actual men or women with a more feminine body shape/overall style, it would just look cute on you guys. Dang it!"
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter who asked for light up shoes. I like the smaller profile of these shoes vs. the bulky hightop version she first noticed at a mall kiosk. I also really like the fabric. Nice quality and really pretty. The light up soles are realy bright. I give them a four out of five because, even though reviews indicated they run small, I was still really surprised. My daughter typically wears a women's 6-6.5, so I bought her a 7.5 based on advice in the reviews. Her toes were at the end of that pair, so I returned them and ordered an 8.5, which fits her with a little growing room. Overall, I recommend them. They're really cute and a good price for the quality. The return and refund process was really smooth."
4.0,"I purchased this dress in Lake Blue to wear to a wedding, and I found it to be very flattering for curves and modest enough not to have to wear a camisole despite having a V-neck. The fabric has a nice sheen to it, but it doesn't look cheap. The ruched waist was surprisingly forgiving and had a some give. I wear a 12 dress, and I purchased an XL, which fit well. My only ding is that it felt slightly too short. It fell right at or slightly above the knee, which made it interesting when the wind picked up."
4.0,Very cute and flattering especially when I wore it post pregnancy and was feeling insecure about my body. I still have the shirt and wear it a lot during summer and it’s super comfy and light weight which is needed during summer in California
4.0,"Nice briefs/bikinis for the price. I am not sure if they are silk or not since the tag is written in what appears to be Chinese. Somewhat see through...so not something to perhaps wear to a public place...IE: the locker room at the Gym/Heath club. It is a nice way to add a bit of &#34;spice&#34; to an intimate time with your wife. So far, I've only worn the black one. The packaging does not say if it is a &#34;hand wash only&#34; item, but I would recommend it.<br /><br />Over all: well worth the price. You cannot find these on the shelves of your local store."
4.0,I love how soft the fabric is but it did have loose threads that I will have to stitch reinforce and it definitely looks nice but it fits a lil small. I'm a 22/24 and bought the XXXL  but still clung to my body ...it looks ok though.<br />I dont mind my donut belly ..lol
4.0,These are so comfortable I could wear them 24 hours a day.
4.0,"little bit different color than expected, pink are really bright, but nice quality.. cute shirt and comfy"
4.0,"I didn’t expect to be beautiful as in the picture in the website . But when it came today , I tried it on . It fits me well the only downside is the hoodie pulls most of the v shape in the chest area so it distort the V . As you can see in the picture , but other than that , it fits prefect , items as describe and it is very cute outfit . My daughter even love it"
4.0,Sleeves are just a little bit larger than expected. Color was just right. ❤️ it.
4.0,Love that it’s a hi-lo cut.
4.0,Not as strong as I would’ve liked it to be but it gets the job done.
4.0,"Not as pretty in real life as they look online. Just looks like a picture behind glass rather than the plug having a small sculpture under the glass like the pictures make it look. Still a 4 star buy. Can't beat the price, and shopping was extremely quick. Seems well made and fits true to 0g size. Would definitely purchase from seller again."
4.0,I prefer a fitted waist.
4.0,This purse is very nice for the price. It seems to be a discontinued style and color. It replaced my vera Bradley hipster model. It has neigh room for a wallet make up bag extra glasses cell phone and iPod. The shoulder strap is not real long but will do.  Great fall pattern.
4.0,"Perfectly sized carry on (as long as you don't expand it).  It's also incredibly lightweight so even though I had it stuffed for a 2 week trip, it was still light enough for me to toss into the overhead bin with relative ease.  The only negative was the handle.  Other reviewers had mentioned this, but it only extends to super high...it doesn't seem to stay clicked at the more reasonable mid-level...so be careful not to take out too many people when running from gate-to-gate.  I preferred to keep it in front of me and push to avoid unnecessary contact with others and/or toppling items when perusing the duty-free store."
4.0,"The size of these earrings are perfect, not too large and not too small.  Nice and light weight as well."
4.0,I did like the item it was soft material but very drapey the large was too big
4.0,"Although this dress is unlined, its style is vaguely vintage and a bit unique. It fits as described, so pay attention to the measurements mentioned in the item's description. I'd advise wearing no-show underwear with this item, and you're set for the office or a holiday party."
4.0,Fabulous earrings.  I will buy the black ones.  The color is off however.  They are much lighter than the photo
4.0,"This dress is very lovely! I'm a size 14 in pants and a 40D bra size and the zipper barely closed. So, this might not be the dress for you if you are a little busty. Also, I'm 5'2'' and the dress reaches more to my mid-calf. The slip underneath comes to above my knees and the floral skirt does have a slit in it. Overall, I am very happy with the dress, I just wish it came in more colors and was offered in  a slightly bigger size."
4.0,"Good product.  Real cultured pearls.  Joy De Mer seems to be owned by the china pearl compay, but I'm not 100% on that fact.  Still a good value."
4.0,it is a nice jacket good for the day. a bit heavy  but seems well madw
4.0,"These shirts are a great find for me, yes some are not correct in craftmenship but they are comfortable, I think these shirts are great....."
4.0,"When you wear a mournful uniform all day, it's nice to be able to brighten up your appearance with a pair of happy shoes."
4.0,"The plastic backings stretched out and I lost one. Also, they were out together so the hoop was sort of stuck. I think the hole for the circle needs to be bigger. Other than that, very cute."
4.0,I bought the socks to go with a pair of slip on sneakers. They are very good however they are a little bit thinner than I expected. It’s more like the texture of a trouser socks. The color is great if you’ve got an tan shoe.  Are use them for my boots that are a little bit tighter and they are a good option. Not a ton of cushioning or padding
4.0,"This top fits as expected. I’m 5’7’ weighing 175lbs bust 38D. I don’t like tops that hugs the body so usually I’d get a Large in tops, but due to reviews and the fact that this material has no stretch I decided to go with an XL which was perfect in width. However, the arm length for me was too short and so I decided to return because I knew it would’ve looked way better if the sleeves were longer in length."
4.0,I like it. It's just not my style. But it's pretty. Will make a nice gift to one of my sisters.
4.0,It a fits but seems to lack additional material to give it that full lengthy look as well n the images if the model.
4.0,I get many compliments on the color. It's a pretty and comfortable dress. I love pockets on a dress!
4.0,son thinks they are pretty cool
4.0,"a little tight , but wearable"
4.0,The yoga shirt is very comfortable and nice looking. My wife does yoga so this is perfect for her. She wears small in general but medium fits just right. So you definitely want to order one size up especially you dont want it to be too tight.
4.0,"Nice chinos for price, they are thinner material so great for summer"
4.0,"I like to walk outside. It's very cold here; so I need to wear something to protect my face. I also wear glasses; so fogging is a big problem.<br />This product is an open piece, it has Hook and Loop Fastening at the ends, so you can fasten it easily at the back of your head. The material is thick and soft. It keeps you warm very well. The workmanship is also very good. The problem for me is it still gets fog on my eye glasses; though much better than some other masks I tried.<br />I would certainly rate it five stars if my goal was not to buy a fogfree face mask.<br />A side note here, after tried all types of face masks, I felt KF94 face mask has the best fog control for me."
4.0,Small for an extra large
4.0,These socks fit well and seem like fairly good quality. The color is a very vibrant blue I got and they wash up pretty well. I personally wouldn’t spend more than $10 for the set though. Just because they don’t seem like they are that fancy of socks.
4.0,My niece loves Dr. Who and loves this watch. She loves that it lights up and recites dialogue from the episode.
4.0,No complains  especially for the price.
4.0,"So I'm a pretty big guy. 6'1&#34; 400ish lbs. I usually wear a normal 2xl in boxer briefs, which are tight, but stay up. These definitely fit with minimal stretching, and there is abundant room for everything. 5 stars if it was a bit longer. Not saying they are short, but I wish they made long leg generic boxer briefs."
4.0,Lovely bag the material feels refine and has a high end look
4.0,"Came in very early, all the colors are bright, correct size and although they are pretty flexible they are not as soft as Hot Topics gauges. However, you still feel as though nothing is in your ears.<br />Everything was great about this product, the only issue was a small tear in one of the black gauges which luckily does not affect them when they are in your ear. Would order again"
4.0,Can't complain for the price. Wish they were a bit thicker/warmer though. They're about the same texture as mens' dress socks.The advantage is they're light and comfortable.
4.0,"i really like it, the fit is what as describe, the upper part nice off shoulder, just make sure u can carry offshoulder cause people complain... u can even use as scarf neckline...bottom part you need to have a little bit of curve so it will stand out, lenght midi make sure thats what u like cause a bit tricky how it will work on your height. im not a midi cause im short and i always alter lenght to suit me...i made it a tunic so i can wear casually ..to my expectation 4 star cause of the fabric, stretch is nice but the knitting have plause some white spots u thought are thread in wrong loop during knitting..."
4.0,"The sizing is about right, its snug on me, but it was butting right against my bust measurements so I took a chance. Over the right color underclothes, it works alright with the laces a bit looser, so you can potentially make it work if you have a 36 bust as well. The laces go through buttonholes, so I'm a bit nervous about those holding. It's two layers of thick chiffon, not utterly sheer, but a slip might be a good idea, especially with light colors. Not as full of a skirt as I had hoped, but overall I like it, I feel like a character in a Studio Ghibli film."
4.0,I thought it would be a lighter color. Clutch is bigger than I wanted.
4.0,Very nice color and fit. I wear them with everything. I wash them on delicate in cold water. And definitely hang to dry.
4.0,Have been using for a few months and it is still looking fairly good. Comfortable and the fit and finish is very good. Will buy more to add color to my watch.
4.0,"I absolutely love these boots, however I had some slight issues with them. I am a 9-1/2, in all shoes. I ordered these, and my heel actually lifts out of them some when I walk because they are so big. They also come up a lot higher on the ankle than I expected. I love the color and the quality for the price, and I wear them with skinny jeans so my heel doesn't lift out of them with the extra fabric."
4.0,Very pretty dress with beautiful details.
4.0,"Great skirt, the fit was tight and a bit short.  I ordered a small and I'm 5'8&#34; and a 123 lbs. The zipper is very cheap but held together and my costume turned out great, I ways very happy with it."
4.0,"I was skeptical when ordering especially when the title states slim fit.  I went ahead and ordered because I needed a blazer type jacket.  It arrived and I was surprised that it fit perfectly.  I'm 5'7&#34; and a bit bulky, so I ordered the XL.  I love the look and feel, quite light.  The material is cheap, in a zip hoodie type material, but it's not a deal breaker for me.  I'm glad I ordered 2 (wine and black)."
4.0,"This is a very lightweight bag with a good amount of pockets for storing all kinds of items. It's made of nylon with a thin plastic liner. It seems to be fairly water resistant. I personally would never use it as a handbag, as it is more of a tote. I will be using this to carry my toiletries when I travel. I don't think it will hold much weight but I will definitely give it a try. After I use this bag a few times, I will come back and edit my review and let you all know how it stands up."
4.0,"This is my fourth pattern of Lazy Ones PJ leggings. The fabric is just a little thinner than some of the other patterns, but overall, cozy and well-made. These are great for lounging on a lazy weekend!"
4.0,Delivered on time and as advertised
4.0,"Color and material are nice. Shirt is very long and hangs halfway down my thighs. It’s a bit more like a mini dress because there is so much space from the belly down. Wasn’t exactly what I was looking for, but it’s decent."
4.0,"Very cute, my sister really loved it! My only complaint is that the size is misleading. It's tiny, like almost hard to tell what it is unless you look very closely small. It's about the size of that index finger nail, and my hands aren't that big."
4.0,"I ordered the large and it was too small in the arms, fit fine else where.  So ordered the extra large and it's  perfect.  Don't  mind a bit large in body."
4.0,The only bad part was that the string was too short. But I trimmed it and made it into a key chain. It is plastic so don't expect much plus it was cheap...I think it was like $2-5?
4.0,I purchased this to go under a wrap dress but unfortunately  it was way too small. The seller contacted me and promised to change the sizing map (which I appreciate). This is a very beautiful and soft tube bra otherwise.
4.0,NOT A SOFT MASK
4.0,"This fits as expected, color matches to the vibrant red shown."
4.0,My grandson love them. A good fit. Leaves him much room to run leaps and bounds.
4.0,It fit exactly how i wanted. Size is exact. Color is good.
4.0,"This tunic shirt is very nice, so comfortable on the body and made of a very soft material. It very good for day to day use and I would also recommend it for pregnant women. as it gives you a lot of space in both the chest and the belly area.<br />However, I must point out this is a simple tunic shirt. it is not elegant and I would not wear it for an evening out. If you're looking for a casual wear, this is the one for you.<br />Also, the fabric is quite thin. It's fine in the black color and it is not sheer, but I'm not sure how it will be with the lighter colors.<br />One more thing, I would usually order the large size, as I usually wear size 12. However in the chart size it states that size XL is size 8. I was pretty sure that was a mistake, but I ordered the XL to be on the safe side, knowing I can always replace if the suze is wrong.<br />The XL is about suze 14, as it is too big for me and very loose on the body.<br />Disclosure: I purchased this item at a discounted price to try it and give my honest review."
4.0,"If you add ice and water, it basically starts cold the whole day. It has great storage size, but don't expect a laptop to fit. Molle webbing is super convenient. Top pocket for sunglasses also can fit smaller amenities like aux cords or charging cables. The water bladder keeps the main storage cool but also has condensation. So, don't expect to keep things dry, unless you stuff a thin towel or something like that. The hydration tube has ab oily taste at first. But it goes away after a couple of uses/refills the velcro patch on the front is also 2x4, so look up patches for that."
4.0,"Fits a bit tight, but good product, well made and exactly what you would expect.  An elastic waistband alternative would have been nice, as those seem a bit hard to find in the std. Pleated Mini skirt."
4.0,This dress is beautiful and soft. I made an  error and ordered a small but I'll give it to my sister as a gift. Just reordered a size medium. I'm 5'4&#34; 130 Lbs.
4.0,"Good quality, it’s very free on me , it’s like amnin a drum"
4.0,"Fabric is of good quality, no cheap material.  Runs a little big."
4.0,"Both rings are great, fit well and feel nice"
4.0,It fits right but it's flimsy on the front part of the hat. I prefer hats to be a little stiffer where the logo is.
4.0,They are off white like tan I wish they were white like the picture shows I love all the rest the rest are true to color except the white .
4.0,"Keeps keys handy. SturdY.  It is a little stiff, but goes on easily and is comfortable to wear."
4.0,"I like the purse organizer... However, I took out the middle because it made the purse too big and heavy... I still have the compartments that I need.."
4.0,"I am disappointed that the print isn’t centered properly on the T-shirt.  I wonder if the seller could replace this one. I like the fabric - it’s soft and fits well. Besides the print being off, I’d give it 5 stars."
4.0,Love everything about it except belt is big and not adjustable.  I'll fix it and it will be perfect!
4.0,"This is very small if you have hands on the larger side. It's a simple 3D printed design, and in my opinion is slightly over priced with a 5 dollar shipping charge for an item which is virtually weightless."
4.0,"What a GREAT idea!  And a great price too!  The only con - can be a little difficult to push the ends thru the eyelet on some shoes, however, worth the effort!  Think of it - never having to tie those annoying long shoe laces that come on tennis shoes!  Would love to have them in colors to match the trim on shoes in future!  Thanx."
4.0,My last badge did not arrive so I bought this badge from a different vendor on Amazon and it's nice it comes as described
4.0,I like this ear cuff--it's the first I've owned--not quite used to it yet.
4.0,"These bike shorts are just the right length , and the fit is great, size is correct I'am 5'7  and 155 lbs. they do not ride up, they stay where you put them. Not too much padding . I tide for about 15 to 20 miles on just a regular bike. , no gears."
4.0,Cute outfits and comes with socks. However the pajamas are on the small side. We order a 9/10 for a child who wears a 6 and it fit him just right. So just order up a size or 2. Other than that adorable pajamas.
4.0,"I love Ed Sheeran so I had to get this T-shirt. I usually wear a Medium shirt, but sized up per the reviews. I'm 38 C and Large fits me well. I washed it and it didn't shrink much. I took off a star because the graphic is kinda cartoonish and could have been done better."
4.0,Very cute! I have had my watch for a few months now and it stills looks and works great!
4.0,just as shown fit is good
4.0,"Colorful, cheap and comfy.  I thought for sure I wouldn't be stuck with one sock<br />missing from any of these after taking them out of the drier.  Sure enough, three<br />pairs were missing their 'mate'.  How do you misplace socks this colorful???<br />Anyway, they look pretty cool with two different patterns being worn at a time.<br />You bought 'em to be noticed anyway, didn't you?  Well, there you go!"
4.0,"My thirteen year old daughter is now into polishing her nails, these practice fingers are a great way for her to become creative. Very pleased"
4.0,"I received my paw print wallet case today. I love the design and it holds my things but, it did not come with the strap. First time ordering from amazon that I was a little disappointed with."
4.0,I really wanted to like this watch.  It’s well put together and sturdy. The bracelet is a little light but doesn’t feel cheap at all.  The dial is attractive and the automatic movement works as expected. My only complaint is the silver on silver makes locating the hands with a quick glance somewhat difficult.  I would go for a darker color dial next time around.  So all in all I do like the watch but think I’d get more daily use out of a darker dial but the quality is there
4.0,"Runs a bit small, and is short in length, especially after washing. I’m 5’3” and they are almost too short. Instead of drying them in the dryer the next time I wash them I’ll try hanging them and see if that makes a difference. The pockets are awesome."
4.0,"I really like this dress. I have some pros and cons.<br />CONS: It says 40 inches in length but it’s about an inch shorter than that.<br />It doesn’t have pockets. In my opinion all dresses should have pockets.<br />The buttons don’t seem very secure. I will probably have to re-sew some on before too long.<br />PROS: the color and fit is beautiful!!!!<br />It’s very slimming and perfect for dressing up or down.<br />Overall, I really like it and will most likely get another color."
4.0,Very nice product.  Looks nice.
4.0,"Great lightweight, sweater material zip up hoodie! The only thing missing is pockets!"
4.0,Great hat! Only wish the elastic held shape longer. It gives quickly
4.0,"I've had to send back many bathingsuits that didn't make the cut, vintage bathingsuits tend to only fit right on the model, but this one I'm not returning. It's modest, classy, comfortable, and beautiful. In my opinion, this is most flattering on someone with a skinny waist. When I have one I'll add a photo lol."
4.0,This gown is great - good quality for the money.  After washing it fit fine and I love it.
4.0,"Not exactly what I was looking for but the product arrived on time, packaged quite well and looks to be a very durable, usable product."
4.0,This is a cute tank order a size up for sure! Looks a lil cheaper than the pic
4.0,"The person I got this for loves it! Super soft material, comfortable, very stretchy in the rear for things. Smooths out your butt. ;)<br /><br />I had gotten a black one (different listing, same company) in medium (He normally wears a medium shirt), as a gift, but it was too snug in the crotch.<br />So, I had to get a large, but they only had one in purple. Their website has patterned ones, but I needed a solid color for being incognito. Luckily, he didn't mind the color, and now I have the black one. lol<br /><br />All in all, Rearz makes quality products for their customer basis!<br />The price is definitely worth it. I could get the same price pair of nice jeans for half the comfort.<br /><br />I just ask for more solid colors in each size please!!"
4.0,"Cute style, good price."
4.0,"Very comfortable shirt.  I would just order a size up from what you normally would.  It fits close to the right size, but I dont dry my shirts, just in case they would shrink.  I'm a thicker woman and prefer my shirts be a bit looser as well, not hugging my body so much.  But would definitely buy again, a size larger!"
4.0,cute and girly.  My daughter loved it.
4.0,Nice bag but I wish it came with a plastic insert for the bottom to make it more stable- kinda flops down if nothing is on it
4.0,Really cute but aggravating to open. I would recommend this though. Its great to use as a camera bag!
4.0,Excellent quality fabric and construction but small. The sleeves are very short on me and I struggle to get out of it when pulling it over my head. I bought a medium. I'm 5' 6&#34; and weigh 130. A large would be better but I wonder if the sleeves would still be too short. They are just shy of midway between my wrist and elbow. It's too bad because the flannel is thick and comfortable and it's well constructed.
4.0,"Great watch. Easy to figure out settings for alarms, timers, etc. the ABC stuff is interesting. Compass and Thermometer are most interesting but honestly not useful for me.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the inner bezel (inside the compass ring but outside the crystal) scratched up easily.  Take a look at NE in my attached photo.  I think I hit the watch on a door knob or something. It’s a digital watch so doesn’t need to look perfect. I just figured it would be a bit tougher. The bright side is now it’s not perfect so I’m not trying to baby it as much."
4.0,It was good i just didn't like the cherry print in person
4.0,"Pretty good deal so long as you keep in mind that these are leggings, not pants. They should be worn under something long enough to cover your tush. The white pair are pretty sheer but since I got them to wear under a dress that was a smidge shorter than I was comfortable wearing on its own, they work out just fine."
4.0,"Great designs and colors, my daughters are 7 and 9 and they love these socks. 4 stars because they are little short for 9 yr old even though the packing said 7-12 yrs old. I would definitely buy again:)"
4.0,I was thinking they would be a bit larger but they seem very lovely and will do for the purpose for which they were purchased. I would recommend them.
4.0,It's tight around my chest and shorter in the chest piece than expected.  I ordered two of Shineya tops and the sizing is pretty inconsistent.  The other one fits much better.
4.0,THE SHOE IS WELL MADE BUT JUST A LITTLE TOO LONG FOR THE SIZE I ORDERED.  IT TENDS TO FIT LOOSELY
4.0,The necklace was a little heavy (hair dryer).
4.0,"Very comfortable.<br />When they arrived in the mail, I immediately put one on. I was slightly disappointed by the O/S fit- even with the straps adjusted I was hoping for a little more cleavage then these provided. I wanted something similar to my Nike workout bra- a comfortable but firm fit. I am a B, sometimes C, so for a larger cup size I think these would give you plenty of cleavage but for me they just work as a comfortable, low support bra. The material is very soft. I fell asleep in one last night and it didn't bother me- I only wish it was a little more resistant! Other then that, these were a good purchase. I bought them to wear as cropped bralettes with high waist jeans and they will definitely work for this. IF the material was less stretch-to-fit or they provided different cup sizes I would have sized down. Hopefully this is something they'll offer one day."
4.0,"I have not used the product on the road yet (hence only 4 stars), but I did experiment with it.  The items I placed in there, ranging from my fairly hefty portable charger to a stylus and some pens, seemed secure.  I especially like the fact that my Bluetooth keyboard fits in the zippered compartment on the back.  Thinking back to other users' comments, it seems like you can always get at least two straps on any item, so with a little care I don't seem dropping items being a problem.  As another reviewer commented, I imagine there is an optimal arrangement of the things I carry most, and once I find that arrangement I plan to take a photo of it so I do not have to reinvent the wheel every time I travel."
4.0,looks great but i needed to cut on the sides bucause was to wide. so confortable<br />.
4.0,"If you are like me and find all underwire bras to be uncomfortable, then you already know this isn’t going to be the most comfortable top - but, that’s not why I got it. I got it because it’s cute and looked like it would be sexy. THAT, it achieved. My husband enjoys when I wear this top, and other than the underwire, it actually is pretty comfortable. It’s also a flattering fit for my B/C cup self, but could fit a larger cup. The straps and the rest of the top is made from a stretchy, comfortable material. Overall I’m quite happy with it."
4.0,I would give these pjs 5 stars but there were not petite. The fabric is soft and cozy. I have pjs from same company in petites and they are perfect in pm. So happy they do the petites.
4.0,"This tee shirt is NOT for the modest.  It is very slim-fitting, body-hugging, AKA TIGHT!  Luckily, I exercise.  If one has a decent torso w/ very little body fat, fine.  Smile, you Adonis!  Your V-shape will be on full display.  If not... ummmm... you might wanna hit the gym first!  Just sayin'."
4.0,Great for a last minute Renaissance Faire costume! It wasn't too tight or too loose. It was longer than which was nice so I didn't have to worry about it getting bunched and ride up under the corset. It was nice quality and light enough you don't die in the middle of summer wearing it.
4.0,I purchased these as a relaxing evenings and weekend bra but have started using all the time. very comfortable but at the same time supportive. I'm really glad they came in a pack of 3 because I would have had to order more otherwise.
4.0,"Web belts are pretty much the same, 90% is nothing more than the ribbon of nylon webbing which is standard, the buckle is where the difference is.  Number one its metal, not plastic, so the click latch is secure.  Number two, the unlatch is really easy yet designed not to be released by accident.  In an emergency, this belt would make a good tourniquet as well.  I usually consider web belts a utility item, for hanging something else on like a holster, more than clothing, but the upgraded buckle makes this belt usable in everyday casual wear, with shorts, jeans, etc."
4.0,"Husband loves it, he prefers blankets / sheets / etc to be REALLY soft, and this absolutely fit the bill. However, this is more of a &#34;around the house robe&#34;, to a bathrobe. He loves the grey-on-grey coloring."
4.0,This is a basic 10X jeweler's loupe.  It appears to be reasonably sturdy.  The magnification quality is acceptable.
4.0,Cute but qay too big for my wrist. Disappointed I can't wear it
4.0,"These are nice swim bottoms to wear with the top of your choice. They are high-legged but fit well. But they are more of a red-orange than a true scarlet, so if you are hoping to match them with a top that has red in the pattern, they might not work."
4.0,"Order up a half size.<br /><br />Ordered a 12, it was definitely too small, toes pushed against the front of the toe box.  Very comfy otherwise.  Color was not as specified, it was all coyote, no green.  I like the all coyote colorway better than the pictured green.<br /><br />An oddity of this boot, even though it is a transitional drop boot, was that it felt like my feet were being pushed forward.  No matter how tight I tied the laces I could not seem to get my heel to seat properly in the heel cup, they did how ever feel secure and snug to my feet..  I would have over looked this if they were slightly larger.<br /><br />Overall quality surpassed my expectations for what I paid.  I returned the 12's and would buy 12.5's if available at the same price."
4.0,"Bought for my 14 year old, she’s about 170lbs, so I got her the XL it was just a little longer than she wanted but other than that fit her well"
4.0,"It has a slightly loose fit. Therefore minimum support for your girls and no tummy control. Other than that, it's a cute swimsuit."
4.0,"Fabric is heavy- this is a good thing- nice cut , ran a little big!"
4.0,Nice ties.. good quality..
4.0,Fits just fine and what I needed.
4.0,Nice and lite. Love the color and the hood of course!
4.0,Little cheap made only time will tell.
4.0,Really like this blouse. Fits great  Hang to dry for best results.
4.0,Nice dress. It's lined.
4.0,Too ong
4.0,"I love the feel of the shirt and the picture is just as it is depicted, but I ordered an XL for a roomy fit and it is snug.  I could not wear it to my event.  Hopefully I will be able to wear it next year."
4.0,Shoes are little slippary.. but for the price ( with some coupon ) worth it.
4.0,Nice yoga pants.  I ordered my regular size and they fit well.  They're not too thin.  I'll enjoy wearing these for my yoga practice.
4.0,Awesome jacket. Fits as expected.
4.0,Very cute and great for evening as a dress.
4.0,It's a little small around the waist but it's great.
4.0,Great watch<br />The only bad part bout it it is tough to get it off
4.0,Just the right size love it 😊
4.0,This little show dryer works great job drying shoes and boots And slippers. It’s especially nice to put on warm boots in the morning. It does an ok job at order elimination. I wish for an on/off switch - it’s inconvenient to have to unplug it when not in use (my outlets are mostly behind furniture). Another wish would be a reinforced way to pull then out if<br />shoes. Its easy to pull them out by the cord but I imagine that eventually the wire will get pulled out if of the plastic housing - especially if used with boots where reaching a hand in might not be easy. Overall it’s a good option and much more convenient to use than the floor model that blows warm air.
4.0,"Love these. They are a bit fragile, the ear pieces are kind of flimsy. But I’ve never worn glasses in my life so maybe I’m just naive. However, I like them. They are exactly what I wanted and expected."
4.0,"Turns skin green, Fun for costume jewelry"
4.0,"These are nice pants, very soft and easy to wear in the summer weather."
4.0,"I wore this belt 2 wks on vacation going thru airport security 2 times without any problems.  The belt was comfortable, is easy to open and close, it does seem to slip a little until it gets to where it isn't to tight.  I believe I had tightened it too much because it did not continue to slip so it never got loose."
4.0,What I like most about the bag is that there is a lot of room.  What I like least is that there isn't enough inside open pockets.
4.0,Looks amazing but is alot larger than expected
4.0,"Llegó un poco aplastada, pero se vé muy bien"
4.0,Good value for the money! The quality is better than the ones I found at Burlington! And I love the pattern!
4.0,I love this dress but the size was too big.<br />I ordered an 3xl.  I’m 5’6 215lbs.  I could have gone done a size.  I also go a petticoat to wear underneath and a jeweled belt.  Very comfortable and great for dressing up for a cocktail party or down for dinner
4.0,"Got these a 2 sizes big so she wear them all season. They very cute. My daughter absolutely loves these boots. One negative is there is no way change battery, hope they last till she grows out of them"
4.0,"Made in China. This is a baby Gift so I did not open it. That package came wrapped in Plastic and I removed it. Per my Daughter, Every baby needs a Spider-Man outfit."
4.0,"Looks good on my Seiko, but the hole in the fabric is stretching after a week. I am not 100% sure how I like the tucked in look. Its comfortable!"
4.0,Like its colour
4.0,"Very small for an XL, opening v line was down to waist. Otherwise beautiful dress"
4.0,"Good glasses overall, but a couple had some sharppoint on the inside of the temples."
4.0,It was a pretty dress. I ordered up a size because of the reviews and it was too big. My bust is 36B and hips 44 and I got a 14 should have gotten a 12.
4.0,"I love the look of these boots, the color is great the material is great. The insole of the shoe is not comfy at all, there’s not cushion to them. These would not be good to wear if you were going to be on your feet for a while. If you are used to heels or shoes like that you should have no problem. They are super cute and can go over your knee of fold them down."
4.0,Cute. Looks great on. My only complaint is the amount of StaticGuard I had to use!
4.0,Great value.  A bit too tight for my 8 year old
4.0,too long for a 5'2&#34; girl. i had to alter it.
4.0,Premium feel
4.0,I like this dainty jewelry and it is light weight.  Hangs just right with my tops. and can be dressed  up or down.  Well pleased!
4.0,Very cute and easy to read
4.0,"Cute dress, but couldn’t button it around my chest, it was way too small. The rest of the dress fit fine, but had to return it."
4.0,"This dress is so stunning. The fabric is better as expected and definitely worth the price! I got compliments with this dress during our Holiday Christmas Party. Just like the other reviews, it runs large on top."
4.0,"Cute earrings.  A bit smaller than I expected, but that's ok."
4.0,"This has some elegance to it, however, it is  a bit small. For someone with a big wrist, this may not fit"
4.0,"I'm not a jewelry fan.  I recognize that diamonds are pretty common, and black ones even more so.  Still, I do think it is rather cool to see them used in jewelry now (like the brown diamonds, which are also quite common!)  The gemstones are artificially priced, but I have no real issue paying for the design which is artistically interesting."
4.0,"This is such a cute bracelet! I really feel like Princess Jasmine in this. However, the clasp is really hard… I have to pull it over my wrist."
4.0,"This tie looks great with a Navy blazer and a white dress shirt. It has held up reasonably well considering how little it cost. The tie looks more expensive than it is, but it doesn't look like a $100 tie, so keep your expectations realistic. Still, I recommend it for its decent quality (relative to its price) and its sharp look when paired with the right attire."
4.0,"I have been using this wallet for a month or more now. It is strong, holds up well and fits my 6-7 cards (license, bus pass etc.) and some cash. A little pricey - but it is for the concept and skill I guess. I would recommend this."
4.0,"The bag is phenomenal but the color on it was a shade darker reddish than I would have wanted. It is very spacious and practical! I would recommend, especially if you want a darker shade leather."
4.0,"Fits true to size. The side zipper chafes me somehow, so I'm planning to throw a layer of lining over it. Otherwise it's a cute little dress to wear out in the summer. No awkward trying to hide my bra straps or anything. Also pockets!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:edef316e1da9b9dfd26065f9e49d8f84]] The trim And fit is what I liked the most AND it is what ripped off as well …<br />Pooor quality<br />Money back would be great - but past the date - I wanted too long to actually wear it
4.0,Really adorable and well made but way too short!!
4.0,"The only thing I would change is the strap length. The shortest length the strap will go is still too long for my liking. It's still overall a cute bag. It was slightly larger than expected, but it's good for sneaking snacks into the movies lol"
4.0,I would like to reorder these.
4.0,Product and packing was good quality and fits as expected !!!!!
4.0,"This is a really great suit!! I love that the top is full coverage and that the tie front is adjustable. The bottoms are ruched and high waisted, which helps cover stretch marks and disguise the pudge (hehe), plus they cover the booty well. The bottoms also have a thick-ish band at the top, which helps them feel secure and not roll down.<br /><br />The only negative thing I will say is regarding the sizes, I think the measurements on the chart are a little off. I ordered the largest size (XXL) because my measurements put me as larger than what the biggest size would fit. I was hoping that it wouldn’t be too little, but I wasn’t optimistic because of the size chart.<br /><br />I am 5’7” 220lbs and wear a 14 or 16 in pants and a 36DDD or 38DD.<br /><br />When I got it, not only did it fit, I probably could’ve gone down a size, specifically for the top. It wasn’t so large that I couldn’t wear it at all, but if I wasn’t leaving for vacation the next day, I probably would’ve exchanged it for the next size down, just so it would be a little more snug.<br /><br />I don’t lay out to tan (peep the pale skin), so when I order a swim suit, I am actually going to be swimming and moving around in the water in it. So, I typically look for the suit to be a little snug, so that it doesn’t get too loose and fall off while in the water."
4.0,fit just right didn't have to cut down at all for my tiny wrists.
4.0,"This scarf is simply stunning. It is much higher quality than I expected and I am very pleased with my purchase. The edges of this generously sized scarf are intricate hearts and not lace like I originally thought.  The recipient of this scarf happens to be a heart fanatic so that was a huge bonus for me when I gifted it.  I chose to get the scarf in a lovely lavender/ purple shade and it arrived exactly like the one in the photo.  The company also included a free gift of a hand tied bead bracelet with my daughter absolutely loves. In addition, the shipping which I believe came from China, was extremely quick. Overall I am very pleased that I bought this scarf and so is my friend who received it as her birthday gift. I received this scarf at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Receiving this scarf at a discount in no way influence my opinion or review. The scarf happens to be great so this review is very easy to write."
4.0,"Hanging eye is unusually large. Only finished on one side -- the other side is hollow. Overall not bad with a nice design, but slightly disappointing in the execution."
4.0,Got this for the wife and she said it was on the small side. if you need it on the snug side order your size if not then go up one. Good product other than that.
4.0,"I really like this shirt. I'm 5'6&#34; and 140 lbs. I went with a medium- the sleeves are a little tight, but it fits well other wise!"
4.0,Es de muy buena calidad pero tiene un mal diseño a nivel del cuello ya que no se puede adaptar correctamente a el
4.0,"Since they're too wide, they weigh down on my ears and the lightweight thing kinda goes out the window. Cool glasses and def blue-light blocking (they include a little light thing for proof), but just too wide. Maybe best for a biiig head. Also, way too much plastic packaging components. Chill out."
4.0,"One of the hats band cracked but, we can make it work."
4.0,Nice basic top!
4.0,I’m 5’11 w/a big but and hips. It was comfortable compressed all the right spots. Most importantly you couldn’t tell that I had it on thru my clothes
4.0,"Works well, not TOO hot, but still keeps my head and ears warm."
4.0,"These thigh socks came in a simple package, clear wrapping inside. They fit just as I expected, and they are very comfy. I like them, but I might need to purchase something to help keep them up on my thighs, although it might just be my chubby legs! Love them! &#60;3"
4.0,I purchased these to give to girls that I mentor in our church. They were perfect for the 6th grade girls...very simple and pretty.
4.0,LOVE these but they’re too short for me so I have to wear boots. I’m 5’9.
4.0,I originally ordered a different mask but it wasn't going to come in time so ordered this one last minute. Overall a good cosplay mask- however it didn't come perfect and there were areas of it where the latex was peeling so would probably not be a good option if you were using it in a cosplay competition. As I was gender bending I found it was very large for a woman's face. You can cut it down but not by a ton. Also it came with a slip through tie for the second tie on the back of the mask. I found this super awkward to use without help so had to replace it with a buckle. Has air holes but still found myself getting light headed for extended use but that might be the case with any mask like this. Definitely wash it before using as it came smelling like chemicals. Good for what I needed but it wasn't perfect. Included a picture of me wearing it lol so you can see the sort of fit.  4/5
4.0,"Nice top, sleeves very long, but body fits well"
4.0,"Very cute, just a touch tight in the shoulders, but very cute and looks nice and just like the pictures."
4.0,"First: if this piece was lined, I would have given 5 stars. For the price, it's great quality and warm, thick cloth, and the skirt itself is beautiful. Every time I've worn it, I've received compliments. The lack of lining though causes a bit of riding-up when wearing tights and might be itchy worn bare-legged, so just a heads up!"
4.0,"Adorable dress! One of the best off the rack dresses for fit for me. I'm a 48 38 48 and with a wide belt, it looked great. The back was a little wide across the shoulders for me but it's a very cute dress."
4.0,"They work great for the most part. The only problem I had was not getting the rings wet. If wet, you have to replace them often"
4.0,"I bought an L but it was a slim fit hoodie, so it is not fitting as expected"
4.0,"I almost thought the small was going to be too small when I began to put it on, but turned out to fit me but must be very comfortable in form fitting attire or size up for some room (hopefully sizing up won't be too much room, you never will know until you buy). The style is very elegant and sleek and the dress quality is on par.  I tried the red which I never do so trying to get used to stepping outside of my box and it looks good. I'm my usual black or white would kill in this dress, but I'm trying something different.  Rating it a 4 only b/c it's more form fitting/tighter than I expected but not prohibitively so. Good quality.  Overall knock-out dress!"
4.0,"I like them, they just make a little bit of noise while walking, but really not bad."
4.0,"These are keeping the sweat out of my eyes at the disc golf course. Not sure how warm they'd be, as the review was asking, but I won't worry too much about that living in the hot hot southern US.<br /><br />The only trouble I have with these is they pop off my head if they stay dry. Not a worry outside here though."
4.0,These are cute but they turned my wrist green
4.0,"It fits good, is very cute. Kind of a pain that it has to be washed by hand.."
4.0,Great buy!! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because you need to order 1 size up.
4.0,"I primarily bought them for the back pocket! I like everything except the wide elastic waist band...fine for walking around during the day, but not so comfortable when sitting at night. I like a looser band with a drawstring to tighten when necessary, but those can be hard to find. I also search for back pockets. The fabric is great, though...real French terry, and mostly cotton, soft and smooth. Will report back if they pill when washed."
4.0,"I love it, but the chain pulls on the hair of your neck, never had this problem with other chains so I think it’s just this product- WHOOP WHOOP"
4.0,"These shoes are the cutest. They are well made, no issues with the sequins/gems falling off. My daughter says they are comfortable and easy to walk in. Just the right height without being overly tall. They only complaint is the soles on the bottom of the shoes wears quickly/easily. On the upside they were sent with an extra pair of heel pads/soles!"
4.0,Good pj’s for hot weather. They are not really thick like t-shirt materiel. It definitely runs small so order up 1 size. They washed well & didn’t shrink. The top is a little tight on me & I prefer a looser fit for pj’s.
4.0,Leggings and ballerina booties are the best
4.0,Love the color. The band is light material so I don't wear this piece all the time. Nice watch
4.0,I normally wear size 4-6 in dresses & a 36DD. I ordered a large in case it ran small. Good thing I did cuz the fabric around the bust and under the armpits is not stretchy. It can feel kind of constricting at times. Other than that it fits perfectly and feels fabulous. Love the color especially! I’ve gotten many compliments when I wear it out and about. :)
4.0,"While this is a very cute hat and mitten set, it still is a bit small for 2 year olds. There’s not as much stretch to the hat and the mittens have no give whatsoever when putting them on my son’s hands. They do seem pretty warm, and the interior of both the hat and mittens are very soft. I would only recommend for children 6 months to a year and half, as they probably won’t fit my son as he grows in next 6 months."
4.0,I got this dress for a certain event and it was absolutely perfect. I’m large chested and it was the perfect amount of coverage and fit beautifully! The fabric was thin and not the best quality but served it’s purpose for me!
4.0,"Cute, stylish but the thinnest &#34;winter&#34; hat I now own."
4.0,5’2” the dress was long. But otherwise was very nice. Very comfortable but lengthy
4.0,verypretty nust smaller than i hoped for so i wentback and ordered larger ones.
4.0,Es bonito xq es grande pero la tela no me gusta mucho
4.0,"Great mask, the eyes are black rubber with small holes to look out of. But i trimmed the openings and cut down some cheap sunglass lens's and glued them in place..... Turned this mask into a totally realistic alien head :)  Also need to blow up a balloon in the mask for a week after you unbox it.... this will make it take shape nicely......"
4.0,I like them but not exactly what I was looking for<br />.
4.0,Its well made but barely fits my phone in. Cute bag though
4.0,REALLY LIKED THE TUNIC. NOT SO MUCH THE TIME FOR DELIVERY. DID NOT KNOW IT WAS COMING FROM JAPAN.
4.0,"This is a perfect romper, the down side to it would be the fabric. It's not stretchy."
4.0,"It came weeks early which I loved.got it a size larger to make sure I had plenty of room,could have done a medium though cause its really roomy.love the lace.my only complaint is the hemline had some fringe on it I don't think is in the photo.can trim it off though.otherwise I think it's okay and I like it's casual vibe.the arms lace feels a different texture then the body part but it's still okay."
4.0,"This hat was just what I needed! The lining was soft and warm, and it worked like a charm in 30-40 degree weather. The only disappointment was that the pom-pon on top of the hat fell off on my third day of wearing it. It was an easy fix, though."
4.0,Very nice and fashionable. Great product.
4.0,Lots of compartments but a little too thick. Not comfortable to sit on
4.0,"The quality is good and they are pretty and sparkling!<br />However, I think if you are not careful, the clip could slide out of your shoes when you take your shoes off. I would use some adhesive to stick these bows in if you want to wear them every day. If for just a night, only using the clip would be just fine."
4.0,"Purchased these for a gift. Very cute, but runs a little small."
4.0,"I'm not a fan of the sleeve ruffles, but I knew that from reading the reviews.  comfortable fit. nice summer dress"
4.0,This watch is very comfortable and fits my large wrist very nicely.  The numbers are large so no readers required.  One caution - the watch is fragile so you have to put it on very carefully so it won't snap and you have to be careful not to catch in on anything (like my car's seat belt).  I would definitely buy this watch again.
4.0,Perfect raincoat for baby.
4.0,"Per seller suggestion we purchased this shirt a size up from what we would normally purchase for my husband and the fit was entirely too big, especially if the item is supposed to be slim fit. We should have purchased our normal medium size and I think the fit would have been better for this shirt. The overall quality of the shirt is nice though, clean sewing and a nice relaxed look.<br /><br />There are no washing instructions on the shirt itself, just a branding tag. The shirt did come with washing instructions attached to the price tag on the outside of the garment, however my brain is going to have a hard time remembering what it said since it is not permanently on the shirt and easily accessible and I have so much laundry to contend with! That tag will eventually get thrown out too!<br /><br />Shipping was fast and the product arrived in adequate packaging. No holes, dirt, or tears anywhere, which is always nice when getting something through the mail!<br /><br />Overall a good quality shirt, too big with the suggested size up but if the shirt shrinks with washes then it will work just fine. It should be noted that I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
4.0,"I love these earrings that do not fade, chip or peel. They are durable and are quality made for the price u pay!"
4.0,This is comfortable and good for home work outs but is not at all flattering so I rarely wear it out of the house. Runs small
4.0,"It looks good in the outside, but inside material it’s kind or dry and annoying to feel."
4.0,"I love this necklace, but only gave it 4 stars because the clasp is on the wrong side, which makes it difficult to fasten.  It's a gorgeous necklace, though."
4.0,These socks fit my 19month old perfectly. Just a touch big so they can last a few months! Cute style and decent material.
4.0,"This is a nice top, especially for casual work day. The pockets do make the shirt sit a little funny near the hips. But, the pockets are surprisingly functional. The shirt was definitely more on the pink side, which was a little disappointing."
4.0,"the top part fits very nice, very sexy, but the stomach area is a bit snug"
4.0,Good quality. Might have gone XXL but XL pretty good and snug. Maybe a bit too snug - can’t really decide. Guess it depends on your preference. Would buy again.
4.0,"I love this bag but I have only had it for a month and it's already showing wear around to the  of the purse, the straps and the bottom.  I don't think a product this nice and for the $$ should be showing signs of wear this soon.  It's a beautiful bag and I hate to think it's not going to last."
4.0,"Was very pleased with the wrist bands. Can’t believe how many bands I received for such a low price. Great buy, and highly recommended."
4.0,Tiny but charming... love my charm
4.0,Wife loves the romper- nice fit as expected per size chart
4.0,"The necklace is crafted as pictured but it seems a bit less red.  More of a light rust color.  Fast shipping!  It's beautiful, however, the necklace chain was broken upon arrival.  Must have been damaged during shipping.  I would have given this 5 stars if it weren't broken and unwearable.  Not quite sure how I'm going to fix this before Halloween yet as it was initially intended to use for a costume piece.  Hopefully I can find something helpful to repair it on YouTube."
4.0,"Taylor Swift necklace, gold coloured, seems to be fairly well made for costume jewelry.  I feel that the actual ‘anti hero’ plate is a little large for my liking and I prefer some of the other designs by the same company a little better.  Fun to wear!"
4.0,This sweatshirt is super cute and comfy! I purchased an extra large thinking that it might fit a bit small but the extra large was actually too large. I’m keeping it anyways because I love the oversized look
4.0,"These are nice jeans and fit good in the waist, the legs are a straight leg, the bottoms are a little tighter.<br />When I ordered these it only gave the waist size of 32, but not the length!!!<br />These Genuine Assembly Men’s Denim Jeans are 32, 34,, too Long.<br /><br />My husband is a 32, 32 depending on what shoes he is wearing.These are a 32, 34..The length is to long with sandals.<br />He is a sandal guy.<br />But men are also rolling up the bottom of the jeans now like women are doing.<br />That said, its winter here in Ca, and my son is taller, and can wear these with boots, and they look good.<br /><br />The rips are a bit much though. I and they, did not think they had to be so ripped!"
4.0,Cute. I like my jewelry to have a little more weight to it that is the only reason for not giving it five stars.
4.0,"This is the first time I buy Bear Trap on line. I owned a pair of snow boot which I loved, but they were getting old. I like this but didn’t realize they were all rubber in the portion of the boot around the foot. My old ones were a mix of suede and rubber which I prefer. Still, this will work well next winter."
4.0,It’s nice but wasn’t very voluminous—was looking for a scarf that was lightweight. But nice—just wasn’t what i was looking for.
4.0,It’s the perfect size for daith piercing! You will need someone to help put it in. And I wish they sold these in packs of 2 so that the clasp hinged on the other side so you can put it in either ear. Since the jewels are on one side only. I tried looking for a diath specifically and had to weed through hundreds that cam up in search but this is a good size and doesn’t look like a barbell or bull nose ring.
4.0,"Color is just like the picture. All the other colors have great reviews, and this pair of earnings is no different. The bow is plastic, the post is metal, and the gems are probably plastic, too - but a shiny plastic. I have really sensitive skin, and these didn't break me out.<br /><br />-EDIT- one of the gems fell out, but I still wear them lol"
4.0,The sleeves a little too short
4.0,The length when sitting is a little too short but perfect for night life
4.0,Cute for 80s party but wouldn't use on the daily
4.0,"Cute set, but the chain for the necklace is a bit too short. I bought an extender for it."
4.0,"nice sandals, hope it will last longer"
4.0,The material feels good against the skin and it fits as expected. Good option will buy again
4.0,"This is. Great gift, but a lot on the thin/small size"
4.0,Cool casual shirt to wear in formal party. Perfect silk red color. And it fits me very well. Nice design.
4.0,"Loved my pair until they disappeared - ordering a couple now replacement pairs now.  It's a little bit of work to get them on a thicker frame sunglasses, however it's possible.  Might try using some cornstarch next time to slide them on."
4.0,Don’t get me wrong it’s a nice mask and being able to upload photos is nice but the mask could be brighter. A lot of photos kinda don’t do well unless they are bright colors. The presets are solid. I tried all the settings and the one that is the most difficult would be the text because I’m the app you really have to format it so it sits evenly on your face. 3.5/5 but I’ll put it as 4 for now.
4.0,"Fits as it says, but it does shrink after washing. Still a nice soft material, very comfortable."
4.0,Cute boots<br />Color is a little off there more of a brighter color then pic. But still cute and look good with jeans. There a tab bigni ordered my norm boot size I could have went down a half size but over all they still feel decent to walk in
4.0,"Nice dress for the price, runs a little big"
4.0,Loved the dress wore for my baby shower.
4.0,"This is a great watchband at a great price.  It's elegant and not overly shiny like some other mesh bands for sale, which in my opinion can really cheapen the look of a timepiece.  I purchased this band to go with a 'vintage' (1970's) Omega watch that I own and it shows off the Omega beautifully.  Inserting the spring pins onto the watch is quite easy using the nice metal tool that is included in the sale and as shown in the photo.  If you're a watch collector, this is a great tool to have as I have used a small pen knife in the past to insert spring pins into my watches, which was a bit frustrating as the knife would not grip the pin the way this forked tool does.  I had a similar watchband with a slide adjusting clasp before, so adjusting the band to my large wrist was fairly easy.  Please note, instructions are not included with this watch band, so if you've never owned a band with a sliding adjustable clasp, I would imagine figuring out how to adjust the band would be a bit daunting but it won't take long to figure out.  I think you'll be very pleased with the overall look of this mesh band and the way it feels on your wrist."
4.0,"I love the shirt and it's great for me to wear it to work. While it does say it's a long sleeve, for me it fit more like a 3/4, but the elastic was too stretched out to leave it as a 3/4 so I just pulled it up to my elbows and it looks great. The opening in the front goes quite low a tank top is needed especially for that reason (the shirt is kind of see through as well)."
4.0,Material is nice but image is defective in print.
4.0,"This is made from very soft and comfortable material. Fabric itself and visor are comfortable, but the placement of the snaps on the bridge of the nose make it uncomfortable for me. There was no way that I could adjust it to make it work for me, therefore I chose to return it."
4.0,they are quality
4.0,Excellent !! Really good...!
4.0,Warm and comfortable.  Allows you to where and still answer touch screen phone.
4.0,"The Beverly Rock thong slippers are cute and are better than expected.  The plush fur is soft and shiny.  I haven't wore them yet but they appear they will be comfortable.  However, I am shoe size 8.5/9 and I'm happy I ordered an XL (10.5 -11) because they just fit.  So they run small."
4.0,Great and good looking glasses. The only issue is that it took several weeks to arrive.
4.0,Really like the soft feel of the material. Love that it has front pocket. Wish the sleeves were a smidge longer and that the waistband was a little looser. I like my clothes to fit a little loose.
4.0,don't really fit but they're cute
4.0,smaller than I thought for my wrist.
4.0,Can't give it five stars until I wear it out. So far so good though. I like the quality of the material. It's a bit small at the top but I took a chance on the one size because they didn't have anymore 2x. It'll do the job though.
4.0,"Super soft and comfy, not as thick as I thought it would be though"
4.0,not too tight or clingy and plenty long for modesty with leggings<br />pleased with this purchase
4.0,The size 7 is a litter larger to my finger. But It's beautiful and safe during travel.I don't need worry about that real diamond. I like it.
4.0,"The thick fuzzy fabric of this top is wonderfully warm. I found it to be about a size bigger than expected. The size small I ordered was closer to a medium. The customer service was top shelf. Had it not been so big, I certainly would have given it 5 stars."
4.0,"These are good! Look very nice in my livingroom, but do run a bit small. I wanted these to put over other throw pillows I no longer want & it was a very very tight squeeze. It looked awful. I ended up having to buy pillows from the fabric store that weren't quite as thick & they now are perfect! (Bought 3)"
4.0,Love materiel stretchy and easy fit . Zipper goes on the back so no button to pull together as you zip up. Little too long and wide below the knees so you may have to hem it
4.0,"A little snugger and less flattering than I had hoped, but SO comfortable that I find myself wearing it all the time. It's on the thin side, but that does help it layer well with other outerwear. I do wish it  had pockets, though."
4.0,Four stars b/c I wish it had outside an pocket....otherwise it's so 60's and summery....LOVE MY DENIM!!
4.0,"So  this a little shorter than I expected it to be, I'm 5'2&#34;, but I am ok with it. I'll wear with leggings. It does fit a little big and that was expected as I purchased a large, I'm quite busty.<br />All in all I am happy with the purchase.<br />I will purchase again although I won't count on it arriving when stated.  Mine was late. It shipped the day before it was due to arrive."
4.0,"Nice dress, especially for the price."
4.0,"Received wrong color in the mail. Didn't bother with returns to save time. Suit has held up after washing a couple of times. Fits well, neither tight nor loose."
4.0,Very pretty.  The chain to hook onto was too lenghty and had to be shortened  as It was made longer in order to accommodate any size ankle.
4.0,Comfortable and adjustable. Just what I needed for my 5 year old.
4.0,"I purchased this necklace as a set with the matching sterling earrings. The necklace is well made, shiny sterling. I wish the chain was longer, other than that it is a great product and value."
4.0,a little awkward at first
4.0,"I really wanted to like these! The fabric is nice, the pattern is unique, and the double waistband V seams in the back are cute! BUT... These give me uncomfortable 🐫 and I don't care for the weird pocket seam ok the inside of the front waistband. Maybe if I got a medium it would fix the one issue but the smalls fit me well other than that. And I'm worried if I got a medium, the waistband will have zero compression because these are already a light compression material.<br /><br />I'm 5'5"" 130-135lbs<br />Waist: 28 inches<br />Hips: 39 inches"
4.0,really liked these shorts too bad they run so small
4.0,This fits just below the knee! Love it! Great fall color also!
4.0,Wide variety for the price. Not the best quality but wearable for fire.
4.0,"Cute shoes, pretty decent product for the price. I don't expect them to last super long, but I've worn them for a couple weeks and they seem to be holding up fine!"
4.0,"I am a small so I ordered 2 pair of small by mistake. I gave one pair to my friend who is a bigger size. My pair had a bit of room, but her pair (a small) fit her perfectly."
4.0,"I wanted a skin touch option that wasn't on my wrist which led me to an elastic band option. I haven't switched it out since getting it in and attaching it. Shocked how much I love it. I do reno DIY and it is lasting really well, plus it keeps my Watch out of my most active zone (my hands). I had it around my bicep for a day or two but ended up liking it on my forearm best for better visibility. The band is barely too big for my wrist area (6"") and plenty big enough for my upper bicep (13""). I haven't noticed any stretching as far as the elastic not keeping shape. Outside of looking at my Watch, I barely even notice the combo on my arm - not even the curved adjustment plastic part. The material is soft but durable in a mute color that hides dirt.  I've noticed a few little picks in the fabric, maybe from catching on wood splitters, but that's nothing to hold against this band. The only ouch I've had is from the watch itself in combo with the band, and that's when the watch somewhat suctions to my skin and then gets knocked. It is rare, but something to consider when using. Highly recommend if you want the Watch off your wrist with multiple location options to adjust to fit."
4.0,"Just a bit small for the advertised size. Nice material and workmanship, though."
4.0,Cloth on zipper has a small stain that I cannot remove. A little disappointing. Quality control should have caught this before shipping..
4.0,"The jacket looks very nice but is somewhat large. It definitely becomes large if the inner jacket is removed - this is somewhat expected but is a bit too much. Nonetheless, the jacket is quite nice and my husband is wearing it a lot."
4.0,This dress completely covers the body and hides all signs of womanhood. Will be pairing with knee high boots and a leather jacket.
4.0,They fit as expected and are extremely cute. However one of the buttons is already coming off and hanging on by literally a thread.  Haven't had them long and she hasn't been unduly rough in them. Just odd. Be wary of the buttons.
4.0,"Love this coat and get tons of ""where did you get that?!"".<br />Only (small) negative, is the closures are kind of a pain. You really have to feel around for them and squeeze/bend them closed and open each time.<br />Overall a great purchase."
4.0,They worked great. I found them to be very comfortable all day
4.0,It’s nice but was tiny I didn’t get to wear it
4.0,"As a hospital floor nurse I feel this are a good pair, just order a size down, I am re ordering for a small. Size 8 women's shoe, 5'6&#34; 150lbs. the Medium just did not have enough compression for my preference, these would manage well enough but I am easily able to slide the mediums on and have extra space, not enough compression."
4.0,"I’m 5’5” and weigh 130 lbs. and ordered an XL. I wish it fit looser like in the picture, but it fit more snug. Also, you can’t wear it by itself, you need to wear leggings because it’s too short on its own. The material is also very thin, t-shirt-like material. But I can’t complain, I got this for $2.60 shipped with a free necklace! Still very cute when worn with leggings and your favorite sneaker. Great casual wear!"
4.0,"The lenses could be a little darker, but overall a good value."
4.0,Great product!! I ordered a large expecting it to be bagie (typically where a small/med) like the pic however it was fitted.. Aside from that aspect great shirt! I got a lot of compliments
4.0,Las mangas son muy pequeñas. Lo demas esta bien para el precio.
4.0,"For someone whos weight isnt proportional to their height this product is amazing!  Im 5' 10"" and 135lbs and got an xs.  Its very hard for me to find things that are long/tall enough and not baggy.  This fits like a glove and the arms and legs aren't short!  The material stretches very well and is quite soft but also slick on other fabric.  There is a gusset that makes it very comfortable once i can get it on.<br /><br />Now for the one bad thing.  The seams are not bad but not average either.  I have to be very delicate when putting it on or else some seams will snap and pop.  No holes yet but it probably wont last too long.  Once its on i can do some pretty crazy stretches with it with no issue.  For the price though I will continue to buy these due to the perfect fit!<br /><br />If they ever beef up the stitching I would gladly pay twice as much for this product!"
4.0,Nice tunic that fit as expected.  A good buy for the price.
4.0,The only thing that I do not like is the length of the dress.  I wish it were longer and that the fabric was not so clingy.
4.0,I was pleased with the quality of the charms. Nice and heavy and the paint is night unlike some that I have received that are muted and even chipped.
4.0,I love this dress for summer. My only complaint is i don't have the bwoobs to fill in the top properly. I have to put a tack in it to keep it closed.
4.0,"Fits quite nicely, I'm hoping it will wash well and resume its shape<br />Perfect summer dress"
4.0,"I wanted to grab a watch from the Citizen Stars Wars line that I might actually wear on a regular basis, so decided upon this one. I must say that I was not disappointed by the watch itself. The face has more detail then is evident from the photos or even online reviews. It has a nice translucent green color that catches the light just right. The band, however, feels cheap, although adequate. You would think that seeing this is a ""limited edition"" watch they could have invested a few more dollars in a decent band.<br /><br />Although probably not a great indicator to as many as might be left on the general market, mine was serialized in the 900's out of 1980 pieces. If you are looking to grab one I would do it soon and because this number would seem to indicate about half of them to be out of retail inventory. As of writing this review they were still available at retail price (if not found around 10-20% under) on many retailer websites.<br /><br />I did ding this review for one star because the box arrived mangled. Yeah if I definitely wanted a mint condition box I probably would have bought it through another retailer to ensure if wasn't just jammed into a padded envelope and kicked to my doorstep. But come on Amazon, you can do better. If you would have just put it in a box at the warehouse it would have been fine. If you are looking to buy this for the collectible nature and desire a box in good shape think about ordering it from another source."
4.0,Attractive and neat fitting mask
4.0,"I would size up and found that sizing up was perfect. The paddings for the  reast are way off. Cute shirt, however."
4.0,"I found out you can't just tighten the screw. I needed to actaully open the clip on the clip-on and snap it iinto place before I tightened the screw. it can be confusing, that's why gave the earings a 4 rating rather than a 5."
4.0,Soft cozy material.
4.0,"These are somewhat small and you should order a size larger than what you normally would to ensure a propper fit. Also the strings start to show fairly early on the leggings which mean they they are starting to come apart already. The material is really comfortable, the only downfall is that the size wasnt what was expected. Totally would order again in a larger size. This product was received at a discount for this honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on these ear muffs and they are adorable! However, they are larger than they appear in the photo which can be deceiving.<br />Though for me I find them comfortable and perfect for colder days when I don't want to ruin my hair with a hat, be warned - they are not adjustable."
4.0,This was pretty but fit small for a Physically fit female. It you have broad shoulders and muscular arms This will not fit right. But it’s just like the photos and a pretty color.
4.0,"Great quality, far nicer than I could have reasonably expected. I know it is not ""Real"" leather, and that it's surface is effectively a plastic coating, but I will be damned if I would be able to tell just by examining the bag. There is a smell, but for anyone who likes real oiled leather, it is great (and not particularly strong either). The ONLY reason I give it 4 stars, is cause it is noticeably Larger / bulkier / blockier in design than it seemed in the pictures / description. I am not saying the measurements are wrong, but it is more of a medium sized (but stylish) handbag than a ""Small messenger bag"". I will be keeping it (cause it's great) but getting a smaller canvas bag for it's original purpose. If you are confident that it's size is what you are looking for, than it is totally a 5 Star bag. If you plan to put alot of weight in it, you might want to pick up a Leather Shoulder pad, though otherwise the included strap is just fine."
4.0,"It's cute. I ordered a size up, and am glad that I did. I am 5 feet 10 inches, 160 pounds, and broad-shouldered, and the extra-large was a good fit. The dress is both comfortable and flattering. The blue color is just like the photograph."
4.0,I really like this wallet however I wish more would fit inside :( it is really sturdy though.
4.0,"comfy, long enough for tall ladies (5 11)"
4.0,The design and cut is awesome. Wasn't sure what to expect so bought a size up from what I normally wear (large instead of medium) and indeed it was too big... Anywhoo simple alterations and I like my end result. Cute buy!!
4.0,Great! Love all the pockets!
4.0,"Was a gift, could have been better quality."
4.0,"This is a race style helmet,so it's tight going on and has very firm cheek padding.  feels very comfortable and stable at speed. Ventilation is good and the overall build quality feels solid. I only paid just over 100 for mine. Not sure how I would feel about it at the current price of 300."
4.0,Fits great for my daughters 4th bday party had to buy something to make it puffier at the bottom
4.0,"This is a very attractive watch with several great features, including the triple sensors (altimeter/barometer, compass, and thermometer), solar charging, Multiband 6 atomic time keeping, and pull-out crown for setting functions. I have small wrists (5.5"" circumference), and the case size was not too large for me. I prefer a case in the 45-48mm range as opposed to 51mm or larger. The silicone band is quite comfortable, but I do not mind resin bands, either. The hands are easy to read for the time, as is the smaller dial that indicates which function is active. The downside: The digital read-out window is of the ""negative"" type, meaning that it has lighter chararcters against a black background. It is nearly impossible to read unless you are in very good light and it is illuminated at the correct angle. Furthermore, the illuminator is not at all bright, so trying to see the LCD panel in the dark is practically impossible. Plus, the luminescence hands and numerals fade rather quickly in the dark. I have found many Casio watches that I would consider buying/wearing, but the negative LCD panel is a deal killer for me. I suggest Casio stick to black characters against a light background."
4.0,This clutch purse is very beautiful and perfect for a formal evening. One side has glitter work and the other side is plane.
4.0,"Shift is nice, material is a bit funky"
4.0,Didn’t think that they would be these noce
4.0,"I did not buy this on Amazon, I belong to a watch club and received from them. The watch is huge, thick and large at 45mm its a bit large for my tastes. Its not a dressy as I like either. Yet the more I wore today the more I liked its ruggedness and somewhat abrasive design. The stem cover is too big and thats what keeps me from giving it 5 stars. But some men may like it if your tall and large enough to pull it off. This is a very masculine watch, the all stainless steel band is rugged and thicker with better locks than most watches. The textured part of the bank is smooth to the touch but looks like it could be use to file wood with!, Again manly, yet not unrefined.<br /><br />Its easy to read and clear numbers makes glancing at the time fast.<br /><br />I also like the open window under the watch where you can see the movement and some weight that I believe is what generates energy to keep the watch going. It has a solid performing Seiko automatic movement so it should be a very reliable watch."
4.0,"I mean...What did I expect for $10. I bought these to go with my daughter's Halloween costume. They fit good, but by the end of the day they were stretching out. With that said, they fulfilled their purpose, so I was pleased."
4.0,"I’m 5’ 4” 160lbs and ordered an XL. I personally like the oversized look and found an XL to fit nice. If I wanted a tighter fit I could have gone with a L. The pants are stretchy and soft, but also see-through. When I wear dark undergarments you can’t tell. I’m a 34C and the top fit perfect, still a little see-through, but I love the tying part in the back. The fabric is soft but also thin, summer and warm weather would be perfect."
4.0,"I like them a lot but I wish they had better support. Very comfortable, good quality, super cute!!"
4.0,super cute for the reading obsessed cat lover
4.0,"I ordered a size up for length, so it is a little large. However the tie around the waist helps give it some shape. It's an easy throw on and go dress. The material is more on stretchy side which is nice and makes the dress comfortable."
4.0,I like the material and color its just too big I will not reorder..
4.0,"Had to buy this 2 sizes larger for a petite woman. It fits though, and she loves it. The material is soft and cool to wear around the house, especially during hot summer months."
4.0,"I did order these jeans for myself and find them better than expected.<br /><br />Here is my take on these jeans:<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Comfortable<br />• Stylish and the wear looks natural<br />• Cotton material (Only 2% Elastane material) makes huge different in feel and the look of these pants<br /><br />Cons:<br />• I did order 33W, but it fits like 34W (even 35W)<br /><br />Haven’t washed these jeans and no plan to do anytime soon; so not sure how the fit or look might change after the wash.<br /><br />I think these jeans are great for the weekends or casual events and are priced very reasonably."
4.0,Works OK so far.  Doesn't set off metal detectors.
4.0,"Nice bag. Was way bigger than expected, but okay if looking for an XL beach bag."
4.0,Very cute little bag for a little girl between the ages of 3 and 5. My neice is a little older and it wouldn't hold all of the things she insisted on carrying in her new purse and eventually ripped. Her fault not the manufacturer.
4.0,Super cute fit. Colors are vibrant like shown in pic.
4.0,Protects your hands when handling food. Only complaint is that they tend to break/tear sometimes when you're wearing them. Otherwise indispensable when you're handling food.
4.0,"Does its job, great value. Nothing special but still functionally sound"
4.0,"Very pretty, comfortable. True to size. Weird fabric though and it doesn’t breathe ...kinda sticky. Not worth the $$ really unless this is exactly the style you want."
4.0,Bought this dress for my daughter and both of us loved it. The fit was just right.
4.0,"I was expecting more of a blend in the material, but maybe I didn't read the overview very clearly. It seems more of a very stretchy polyester. It does fit very nice and is sexy. I probably would wear it as more of a somewhat dressy outfit as compared to an everyday dress, unless I lived in an area with more frequent sun (in Seattle it does not seem like it would be a great everyday type of dress). I'm 5'9 145 and ordered a medium, it fit great and the color was just as the picture portrayed. I also don't think I would wear underwear with this dress due to the cut outs but you could maybe wear something very low rise. A bra fits fine with this dress, it just may have to be brought up a little in the back to prevent it from being shown."
4.0,fit snugged but its lovely
4.0,Wonderful... great for my everyday work bag!
4.0,"The watch is very pretty when you first have it in your hands. It did come a little large and I had to remove some links. They links are very soft wood and break very easily. Besides that though, I'm very happy with this watch."
4.0,It’s a cute dress but it’s tight and the material is a bit scratchy/cheap. It fits me a little too snug so the fabric gets all stretched out and thin.
4.0,"Nice bag.  The appearance is much better in person than depicted in the photo. The 2 front pockets are deep enough to carry a large phone, keys, badge or wallet. The interior of the bag is large enough to accommodate a kindle or ipad.  Very user friendly commuter bag.  My only quibbles are that one of the pockets has a crease that formed when it was folded over, yeah, a little nitpicky but there it is.  Also, the back zipper pocket would be much more useful if it were deeper.  All in all, its a nice bag and if it were in a color, like red, I'd probably purchase another.  I do wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars."
4.0,It’s not the best bra but it will do for the price paid.
4.0,These earrings are simple and cute. I'm am happy with my purchase..
4.0,I bought these through my husbands account. I have a small face and these r suppose to b youth but they r a lil bit to long and the ear pieces stick out of the back of my hair. I love them though and am going to order another color.
4.0,I returned this. It was well made but it just didn't do anything for me. The ruffle seemed flat and strange to me. I did get the Pour Moi halter top after this and I love it.
4.0,"Overall I am pretty happy with this product. It is very comfortable, and I notice a huge difference in sleep quality when I am without it. I wear it every night, and am on my third mask and will continue to purchase them despite any negatives! As to the negatives...<br /><br />After reading the other reviews I see that other people concur with my biggest two complaints. Both of the issues seem like they should be easy to fix, but I have had these problems with several similar eyemasks, so maybe it isn't so easy?  Specifically, the inside lining peels away from the foam. Also the dye comes off onto my sheets. It does not wash away easily, as some commenters have claimed. I solved the peeling lining by stitching around the edge, and the dye problem I am just living with."
4.0,"There was a very strong chemical/plastic smell from the mask upon arrival that dissipated slowly over time. (I would recommend letting it air out at least a week before wearing!) My little guy was slightly disappointed that the mask wasn't more firm and appeared very floppy; however, once the wearer puts on the mask it straightened out nicely and looks great! He loves it now."
4.0,I like this hat but could see others not liking it. I wear it backwards but could not wear it forward. As another post stated it has a short brim. I typically wear hats in the 7 range.
4.0,"The necklace itself is cute and I was excited to wear it, but the clasp was broken on arrival and doesn't work.<br /><br />Update: the company contacted me and was really great. They got me a new necklace sent out that is not broken. It is really cute and perfect for my daughter who was the intended recipient."
4.0,Good service  product too small
4.0,"These are very well made, and a wonderful fabric BUT they are not as nearly long as we hoped and they shrunk a lot, very quickly. We air dried some, and put others in the dryer, but they both shrunk the same amount."
4.0,Runs small but I don’t think they would stay up if I went up a size. Disappointing.
4.0,"The dress was very nice, fit as expected, only minor adjustment needed around the arms. Bought a small, 5ft, 123lbs"
4.0,The material was very soft and kept the child warm on cold nights.  It laundered very well without shrinkage.
4.0,They do what they are supposed to do...keep stuff off your shirt
4.0,"This is super cute and great quality for the price. Only downside is that it’s way longer than I expected. I’m 5’6 and got a size Small and it drags on the floor when I walk, only by like maybe a few centimeters or maybe an inch. But still. I’m wearing this to the renaissance fair and a little concerned it will rip or get pretty dirty while I’m walking around. Other than that I recommend. I got the green and it’s such a great fit and color."
4.0,"It runs small,  so size up a bit."
4.0,"Thinner, shirt material so if you have a little bit more curves, a shaper would be needed underneath."
4.0,"It was a fun, well received gift."
4.0,Watch is fine na
4.0,"Watch all aspects are good, I like it very much. Function a lot, I also want to study slowly. Just watch some of the data is not very accurate."
4.0,Decent price
4.0,It comes shrink wrapped but material is not wrinkled when opened. I am 5'3&#34; 145 pounds with 34DDD bust -- this dress is short when you are busty -- it is soft and cute -- but if you have any curves or rolls you will need soanx as it is form fitting -- I ordered an XL
4.0,Love the material very stretchy fit like a glove once on Very comfortable to wear
4.0,"Very cute, well made, doesn't take up a lot of space nor add a lot of weight to my purse."
4.0,I like it..very pretty.
4.0,"This is well made, seams at the armhole (pits) match up, attractive, nice fabric - both soft and appears durable.  It is cuffed at the wrists and ankles.  My husband typically wears a XXL and this was more fitted than expected.  Doubt this will be worn to the gym, my husband said it reminds him of sweat suits he had in the 70""s, more walk around than gym wear.  The hat was a nice bonus:)  Overall, except the hand wash issue, he really likes it."
4.0,I wear dress to church. Dress mistitch at the top. So the top looked funny. Not the best material but it was ok
4.0,"Its decent for a first buy. It is simple, it has nice length also. But The curls will very easily loosen, so its pretty easy to friz this wig up. I am hoping it will still work well when it becomes straightened as I don't mind the loss of curls."
4.0,"I like the general style & color of the cufflinks. Don't know if I'll use the ""glow"" feature or not but is certainly interesting."
4.0,"Based on size requirements, SIZE UP!  My husband normally buys an A5 but based on the size specifics, he got an A4.  The A4 is short. It’s not the width, it’s the length. He is 6ft, the arms are too short.<br /><br />But the price, you can’t beat it. Oh and the lightweight fabric, so much better than the other more expensive so called “light weight” kimonos<br /><br />Update: we ordered an A5, fits perfectly.  So whatever size gi you normally order, stick with that"
4.0,I like the sunglasses and they fit me well and are light on my head.  My only concern is that they feel cheap in my hands.  The arms are a bit stiff when opening them up.
4.0,Not a bad shirt.  Nothing fancy.  Fits well.  It's kinda thin material though.
4.0,"I mostly liked this dress, though it had a few elements that cheapened it slightly.<br />What I like: opaque fabric with hints of shimmer, as well as a color-blocked trim at the top of the bodice; adjustable straps.<br />What I didn’t like: one of the straps was twisted in such a way that can’t be fixed because it was sewn on incorrectly (see photo). Additionally, the fit around the bust area isn’t particularly flattering because it lacks either darts or princess seams which would create a molded shape. Those are things that cheapen this dress. With a current price close to $30, it loses a star for value, but if the price were to go down a few bucks, I would say it’s quite a nice dress."
4.0,Ordered a large because reviews said it fit small. It didn’t. Definitely could have gone with a small/med. still very cute. I like loose shirts. It’s very long in back though. Falls below my butt.
4.0,50/50 polyester and cotton. fits a little larger than i was wanting but still works. haven't washed it yet so it might shrink a bit too. the image is bright and crisp and totally worth it for the laugh
4.0,"Nice yoga pants.  They feel incredibly soft and they look nice.  The waist is high and the length is to my ankles.  My only complaint is that there is no hem at the bottom of the pants, so they feel like they could fray over time.  Otherwise they are great."
4.0,It’s hard since I have a straight body type with no waist. But these pants contour to my hips and waist. Very comfortable and not heavy. Although I must say that it is snug when first trying on
4.0,It's more of a brushed copper than rosegold.
4.0,snaoge on clothes after a few wears... have to be very careful with what youre wearing... Ive ruined three shirts with snags
4.0,not a tight fit. doesn’t sit properly on my son. i have to constantly adjust it.  some hair falls through. still catches a lot of the hair though.
4.0,Hat is warm and comfortable; it fits well. The mask however is too small for even the smaller face of my 12 year old son.
4.0,"Very good quality sleeping bag for my one year old. He like it and enjoys rolling around in the sleeping bag. But I don't think it will fit him next year so it is definately not for 2 or 3 year old. Also, it could have been better if it was a little thick."
4.0,Very pretty but a little large ... I will have to take off a few links so it doesn't look too silly when I wear it.
4.0,These are very comfortable. They also were a gift and the person enjoys them.
4.0,Super comfy fabric. Just was I was looking for in a nightshirt. It is a fitted look and the length could be another 2 inches longer. Ordered again as the fabric is worth it being a tad short..
4.0,Works fine but side of attached pokes ya!!..;(
4.0,"This skirt is so long I can legitimately wear it as a dress instead. It actually works pretty well that way. I did as others suggested and sized up. I'm not sure it was necessary. This material has a lot of stretch to it. I love the design and it feels great. It's just ridiculously long. For reference, I am 5'7"" tall and 165 lbs. I normally wear a size M/L, depending on the item. Pants I almost always wear a L. I ordered this skirt in an XL. When I pulled it up to wear like a dress, it still came to a little above my ankles."
4.0,"I work in a nursing home and am always looking for new scrubs; I like to have some variety in my work wardrobe. I am 5'5&#34; and usually wear a medium or large size in scrubs. I ordered a set of these scrubs in size large, colored Caribbean blue. They are well made with uniform stitching and no loose ends. I have washed and dried them and they have held up well, with no fading or fraying. The material feels comfortable against my skin.<br />The top fits me comfortably as expected, and it has a nice v-neck. The pockets, one front breast pocket and two lower pockets, are sufficiently large and do a great job of safely holding my pens and gait belt.<br />The pants fit me nicely, they have an elastic waist band and they are adjustable with a drawstring. They have two side pockets and two cargo pockets, which is plenty of room to carry everything I need to get me through my shift.<br />Overall, this is a decent set of scrubs for me to wear to work. I was blessed to receive this item from the seller at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased evaluation and review, in order to help other customers learn more about the product before they decide whether or not to buy. I was not told what to write, nor was I asked to give it a certain rating, nor was I influenced by any party. I actually use every item that I receive and then I write my review sharing my thoughts on it. I will not remove a negative or lower star review at the seller’s request, nor will I hold back from posting a low star rating if I feel that the item deserves it. Whether positive or negative, all of my reviews reflect my own opinions and may differ from others opinions."
4.0,My only complaint about these so far is that the bows come loose really easily. The little screw seems to easily work it's way out and the bows wiggle. Otherwise I love them and they've really helped with my work since I sit in front of a computer for 10+ hours a day with multiple monitors. Cut down my headaches!
4.0,Fits perfectly for both me and my wife. Good quality material and water proof. Easy to wash in washing machine.
4.0,Beautiful! looks just like the picture
4.0,It works ok
4.0,But looks great.
4.0,"First I love the shirt.  soft, cool, would have been great.  I'm not a large person,  a bit under 6 foot,  No big shoulders, arms, just average.  I typically wear X-Large which fits comfortable and give me arm room and room to move.  This shirt in a X-Large,  the sleeves would not roll up past the Elbow,  The shoulders were tight,  as if I stretched out to reach or grab,  they would rip.  I've returned and hope to have a 2X size in a day or so for a better fit"
4.0,In the chart it said to size up. I am originally a size C so I chose for the D like it said I put it across my waist and it seems like it will fit well. I didn’t want to demonstrate it because I’m not sure how many times the stickiness will be reusable so I will come back with an update when I actually use it.
4.0,Fits nice and slimming
4.0,"Great basic black suede ankle boot. Consider buying half size down, especially if you don’t wear socks or wear very thin socks."
4.0,"Love the UV protection and polarization. A little big on my 2 year olds head, though. Other reviewers have said otherwise. Wider and longer temples than children's place toddler sunglasses, for comparison."
4.0,"BEAUTIFUL DRESS. High quality fabric and stunning colors. Dress runs a little bigger so order True to size. I had to order two of these dresses to find a good fit. First dress was too big. I ordered 6/7. Second one was 5/6 & a little smaller but a much better fit although still a little roomy up top. LO wears a 5t and dress in pic is a 5t. I plan to buy another dress to match her baby sister. Headband is beautiful.  Perfect fit. You could see the white zipper part in the back which I didn't like but for the price, it was still a pretty awesome dress. I have to return the first one though."
4.0,"Feels very soft and nice against the skin; since it's 80% acrylic & only 20% cotton (which I generally don't like in sweaters but oh well) I wear a sleeveless cotton top underneath it. It is VERY warm, so even in frigid Chicago temperatures where I live I wear only a light Gortex jacket over it.<br /><br />It looks great with jeans, leggings, yoga pants."
4.0,The quality is good.  I ordered an XL.  I normally wear a size 14.  It was a little small but I decided to keep it.
4.0,Nice. Just too heavy for me.
4.0,"Product works well as a rain jacket. Not so much protection from windchill. I like the breast pocket and back pocket, but miss the side pockets."
4.0,Not my best fit for this style
4.0,Beautiful tie.
4.0,Always luv Scooby
4.0,Very comfortable and breathable! Much better on my skin than the band my watch came with. I would have given 5 stars but I had to fumble around with the pins that connect the watch and band. It would have been great if they were already attached. Thankfully it came with 2 sets of pins! I'm happy with this purchase overall.
4.0,"This slipper is very comfortable. However, I’ve had plantar faciitis and fallen arches. I found the arch support just a tad less than I need. Otherwise it would be perfect. I would love to see a version with a little more arch support."
4.0,"Its a lot less of that bright yellow gold, and has more of an orange tinge on it. Other than that its pretty great. Only a bit heavy."
4.0,These are comfortable
4.0,"It looks great in person. We got the dark blue and it is very pretty. Will have to update review after I’ve been able to use it in the sun. It’s been cloudy here since I got it. The only concern I have is that slight wind really makes it sway side to side. We also bought the wiki wiki 10ft cantilever umbrella weight base to go with it. So I don’t think it will tip over but I’m not sure how well the canopy will hold up. Super easy to open, move around and adjust! **I bought mine based off all of the good reviews and you should know that I am only leaving a review to get a free extra canopy fabric from an offer that came in the box. **"
4.0,really like these but they are kind of big.
4.0,Really cute. More of a tunic on me. My legs are long. But I like it!
4.0,Swimsuit was really cute but had to buy a smaller size as it was way too big!  Went two sizes smaller and it’s still a bit big.  Hopefully will fit perfectly next year though!
4.0,Fits great I love it ' in 5'6 and 182 and I got an XXL
4.0,I love this hoodie! It’s a little thin so you might need to layer it in the colder months but other than that it is good quality. Size up if you’d like it to fit a little big.
4.0,It's a bit smaller than I thought but it's great for the price!
4.0,Nice skirt at a nice price....
4.0,"It’s totally authentic looking, but to be honest I haven’t worn it once purely because it’s a total pain to put on and remove. You have to unscrew both sides and rescrew it back on. If you can sleep with it on, you’re totally fine and this is definitely a great purchase! If you’re like me though...not the best option because that’s an extra minute I could be sleeping. 😂"
4.0,Super cute dress - runs a little small . Order one size up if you are not comfortable with a snug fit
4.0,Very well made jacket. Runs very small in my opinion. Ordered a size up and it still was very small. Had to return.
4.0,"Very beautiful.  Not a choker though, as pictured. It is a long necklace. Amazing quality, (very nice beads), I thought for the price.  However, was shipped in soft packaging, so one of the big gems had come off, even though you could see had plenty of glue on back, was probably jarred off during shipment.  Which is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because I now have to glue it back myself, as it would be more trouble to return it!"
4.0,"So, this may be a little lengthy and I apologise for that.<br /><br />As a cosplayer who is used to buying from numerous manufacturers and suppliers from Amazon, Dokidokicos, Aliexpress, etc, I'm used to having to pick my battles when it comes to fast, efficient, and cheap versus quality. The cosplay itself is pretty decent, using an average fabric (the usual cosplay fabric) and nice shinier details for the trim. The chain for his belt loop is not bad, but this cosplay falls flat in other areas that, while not the worst, are enough to nitpick at for those wanting to buy this for their final Tsukasa Tenma (cannot say about the others, sorry). The sizing itself is off because I measured myself right before ordering and due to my time constraints, I had to go a size smaller than the sizing chart would've fit me. However, I was (pleasantly) surprised to find the cosplay is actually a tad bit big on me, not overly so but enough that I'm considering taking it in or going a size down for this brand specifically. However, as pleasant as sizing can be, I find issues in the details.<br /><br />I buy and make my own cosplays, but I was unable to have sufficient time to make this cosplay and have it be something I'm proud of, and since I'm matching with a group, I wanted to get something in decent time. As I said, the cosplay itself is not bad quality, but the small details are enough to bother a seasoned cosplayer. There are some parts where part of the tassels begin to peek through the silver wrap, the cosplay is missing two of his pieces that are supposed to go on the right side of his blue collar, and some of the pieces generally fit oddly in some places versus others (ie the underarm parts feel a little restrictive, all things considered). The buttons and tassels on the front of the jacket feel a little haphazardly thrown and sewn onto the front (not coming off, but it feels cheap). The cravat piece feels flat and out of proportion compared to the rest of the cosplay, especially compared to the reference material. For the time it arrived (I ordered it for the sake of prime) and its price, it meets its mark about 85% of the way, and it probably is just the cosplayer in me that is pointing out the small flaws in it.<br /><br />TLDR: For a beginner cosplayer or someone in a time crunch, $100 (give or take) for this cosplay is not bad. It does the job. For someone who can afford to wait a little longer or is prioritising quality over speed (or if you don't have prime, because without prime my review would've dropped lower), I would take the time to look into AliExpress or another company for this cosplay, especially if you can get it cheaper."
4.0,These are a great low cost reading glasses solution.  Been ordering them for a decade.  All orders received and well.  One of 5 orders (most recent) should have had 3 brown frames and one blue frame.  Arrived 2 blue frames and 2 brown.  Overall- highly recommend.
4.0,I listened to the reviews and went a size down and I wish I hadn't. I am a true ten and I should have gotten a 10. I went with the 9 and it fits like a 9. The make and model of the shoe looks good though. sturdy yet light. I will have to return them though. GOOD LUCK!
4.0,Love these Pom Poms and will definitely buy them again. It's soft and fluffy and the colors are pretty.<br />Although they are cute they don't hang on for too long. The pom felt of when I clipped it to my backpack and never found it. That's the only downside i find.
4.0,Sleeves and bust to tight
4.0,I thought it would be a bit bigger and baggier. It is super comfy though. One of my new favorite shirts!
4.0,Very pretty fo a girl but it’s tiny
4.0,"El modelo del reloj es exactamente igual a la foto y a su descripción, la pulsera no es de buen material."
4.0,"LOVE THIS JACKET! Only complaint I have is the sizing. I'm 5'9 and 145 pounds. Ordered a large, and it's a little small for my shoulders and short for my arm length. Not super noticeable though."
4.0,love the dress! fit everywhere except in the chest it was a bit big but can be taken in very easy.
4.0,"When I first took out of pkg, I had some doubts. But it pressed up nicely & fit quite well.  I’m only 5 foot tall so length in just below my knee."
4.0,"It is beautiful and does its job perfectly. Inside it doesn't have the quality I'm used to from this brand's products, but it's not bad."
4.0,Adorable on our little princess. They fit her perfectly.
4.0,"So far so good, we'll see how it holds up :)"
4.0,will actually test it out soon
4.0,Dress is Perfect in every way. Very Elegant. Material is Great. Will buy again!
4.0,"I usually wear Lg, but got an X-Lg. This so rum semi small. Depending how you like to wear it. I’m not a right wearing person so I love the X-Lg. Light colors are a bit see through so I would stay with dark colors. I will be ordering more for this summer."
4.0,These are super cute gauz/cotton material. But my daughter  Who I bought them for does not like him. I will keep them and wear them myself.  They are comfortable and cute to hang out  at home or run errands  I wear an oversized lavender shirt and strap he sandals with them.
4.0,These are adorable and very stretchy. My only complaint would be they are difficult to stay up over my daughters nose as a mask. I do like this product as a headband though and they have been worn very frequently in my girls hair but as a mask I want to find one of these with a drawstring so it can stay up while at school. Overall I would buy more of this product but for hair accessories!
4.0,"I ordered this tote to carry my needed items for travel and for the flexibility to shove under a seat on a plane.  I love the true cherry red color as I was concerned it might arrive as an orange red. The quality of stitching looks sturdy. The handles are not leather to my disappointment. The tote is true to size as advertised.  I would have ordered larger size if it had been offered. An iPad might fit, but not a laptop. A better quality liner would have been appreciated. The liner is attached on the two top corners inside the tote by a snap and the liner is sized smaller than the purse.The raw leather is exposed inside of the tote as the liner is not attached, but this does not brother me. I may look for a replacement liner. Overall I like this tote."
4.0,"I'm a 34D/DD and the top doesn't have much room for the bust. If you are chesty, order a size OR two larger.<br />Otherwise, cute and comfy dress."
4.0,I love this suit!  It fits great and and is very flattering.  I havent gotten it wet yet though  and Im hoping the sheath part doesnt sag! I kind of wish the top  had underwires for more lift  but even so it supports well enough .
4.0,I ordered a size large. I received a size extra large. I am very thankful that the shipping department went up a size. There is no way a size large would have fit. However I wear a large in all other clothing tops. So based on my experience I feel you clearly need to go up a size.
4.0,Love these bras!! Wish they would last longer though
4.0,"Very good quality, stays in ear. Would get a five star but no way to tighten to ear so they droop down in front on my ear."
4.0,Comfortable and flexible. Great fit!
4.0,"Got these for myself. Be aware, compression socks always run TIGHT. As a nurse, I learned to stretch them out before trying to put them on patients. Take an end in each hand & pull out as far as possible, repeat several times. To put on, gather them up at the opening & stretch hard, making the opening easier to slide over toes. Once they're on, you'll find they feel REALLY good, decreased ankle swelling when taken off. Easier to put on with repeat wear."
4.0,"Loved the look of this.. but, after wearing only a few times, the bird did not look silver anymore. It looked yellow. I wanted this to be a piece I could wear everyday.. disappointed."
4.0,"I never wear padded sports bras, but these are pretty nice."
4.0,"I'm not a guitar player that dances around so I haven't had any issues with the picks falling out.  Fits my guitar and my size, 6'2"" 210, well.  The picks are in an easy spot to grab from as you are wearing it."
4.0,"The ruffles are awkward a bit, I pinned it to help it but it ran a touch big for my liking.<br />Super cute though!<br />The lining is great except slippery against spanx;)"
4.0,"I’m glad I bought these but the design is significantly less vibrant than the pictures. The color is full. Nonetheless, the mask works as intended"
4.0,"I tapered the hip a little, because I do not have a wide hip. I like it very much. I get a lot of compliments on the dress and the fit."
4.0,"wish there was more hair, but overall it was really decent."
4.0,The adjustable leather band it's on is very strange.
4.0,My kid lives tractors
4.0,So far I have no problems and they seem to work like advertised
4.0,My wife bought these and she said they were too tight on her big booty. I thought they looked GREAT but we returned them and went for the larger size.  :(
4.0,"I purchased this dress to wear to my cousin's wedding last weekend.  It was very pretty, comfortable and the pockets came in handy.  I purchased a cardigan to go with it and I was fine during the outdoor evening ceremony in Phoenix."
4.0,"The quality of work is nice. But the clasp is the whole reason why I bought this item and it’s not that strong…as I am going threw my day and working. I notice that if I bump it or move around to much, the clasp opens and the watch almost falls off my wrist. It has happened multipul times now and I just bought and received it!"
4.0,Just bought these socks for an upcoming trip to Europe. Have not used them yet. They feel comfortable and are not uncomfortable under my knees. Nice quality. Looking forward to trying them out on the plane.
4.0,"Fits well, looks beautiful, and stretch perfectly around face"
4.0,I like to use these rings when I am working out or doing anything else where I don't want to wear my wedding ring.  They seem to fit true to size.  They do have a little stretch but the rubber is strong enough that I suggest you order your correct size (or size up to the next full size if you are between sizes).
4.0,"First of all I LOVE this dress. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the arms of the dress are much narrower than depicted in the photo. That being said, I have since ordered two more pieces from this company and have not been disappointed yet."
4.0,"While my husband was pleased with the watch - quality is great and is stylish, we found the ""easy link"" system impossible to size.  We ended up taking the watch to a Fossil dealer for them to size the watch - they struggled with it too.  Since you only have to size it once - it is not that big of a deal."
4.0,"Neat, a bit strange and ships from China so buyer beware.<br />it would be better if it weren't coated in something like plastic to make it black."
4.0,Not too big. Fits just right without a choice of soze option
4.0,"Two-ply lace adds a little warmth as well and girliness.  Unlike some laces, I did not find this itchy or irritating to the touch.  It feels quite smooth.  The faux fur collar is very, very soft; feels super nice against the skin.  Long, but not overlong.<br /><br />The one reason that I deducted a star is that it is so smooth that it easily slips off the shoulders. The inner collar would have benefited from a strip of fabric or ribbon that would help hold it up on the shoulders."
4.0,"Now, I know these aren't meant to be slept in but they really are so comfortable to wear during the day that I honestly forgot I was wearing mine! My only issue is how much it hurt to wear it to sleep... over all, I bought one for me and a friend and she has no issues with it at all, she wears it to sleep all the time and thinks that it is fantastic!"
4.0,"Fantastic. Fabric is a little different than expected, but it's very soft and comfy! True to colors."
4.0,4 star rating due to outfit was good looking upon partner.<br /><br />Upper chest area was a bit tight.<br /><br />Beyond that looked great and was a pleasant outfit to see someone special wear it.
4.0,"Mask seems fine. Seems a bit thinner than my other mask. (Outdoor master brand) However, it should be just fine for cqb airsoft. My only issue is the 20 day delivery period. (Ships from Asia) I wish I had looked a little longer on Amazon, as there is the exact same mask available through Prime."
4.0,"I love this watch! I love that it's black on black. It's so minimalist and understated. Nothing bright and shiny (no gold or silver). The pink second hand gives a feminine touch.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, though: The photo is misleading. The hour and minute hands, as well as the hour markers, are not clear white marks. They are super-thin shiny metallic, like needles. So in many lighting conditions (not super bright light), I have to move my wrist this way and that to try to get the hands and hour markers to catch the light in order to see what time it is. So, if you're looking for a watch that you can surreptitiously glance at, this is not it. In spite of that shortcoming, I still really love this watch, and wear it all the time, everywhere."
4.0,Just what it looks like on the site and my wife LOVES IT.  I took of a star because a charm fell off and I had to place it back on...However no issues in the months we have owned it since then.
4.0,I have the galaxy 4 classic. The band does fit just fine. The bedazzled bezzle does not. That's my only complaint. I knew that when I bought it but would love if the whole look was possible with the 4 classic. (Hence the 4 stars instead of 5) Fits snug and gives such a sophisticated look to the watch. Super happy.
4.0,"It's all light brown, and hard to put on without help. But it's not cheaply made, it's pretty sturdy!"
4.0,Super cute!!!  Bought as a present
4.0,"4 stars because of the number of compliments. I just wish they were longer with a more comfortable, ""giving"" fabric."
4.0,"My mom got me and her this necklace and we both love it, but the gold did start turning after having for about a year now and that is the only reason why I am giving it a four out of five stars."
4.0,"I ordered these andthe price was right, they arrived very quuickly and they are a perfect fit. I will be back Breckelles."
4.0,Love the olive color. But I bought for my husband and they are way too small when advertised XL Men's 9-12. So my son got them instead.
4.0,I probably should have listened to what other reviewers said about the dress fitting as expected.  I ordered a size larger which is fine but if I had ordered my true size (large) it would have been a perfect fit.  otherwise this is a very sexy dress.
4.0,It’s cute but runs small.
4.0,"My head takes 7 5/8 hats.  These bandanas arent the softest but easily fit and absorb excessive sweat.  Before this purchase, I made the mistake of wearing a new dark colored bandana without first washing. The fabric bleeding was intense!  I scared some people. These black and gold wraps did not bleed much even after the first washing!"
4.0,The watch is nice but the band is too stiff. I had one and the first thing to go was the band.
4.0,a little small great seller though
4.0,"I love this dress, but unfortunately realized too late it was a little too form fitting for my office. Great for a night out!"
4.0,"Make sure you size up, and if you have curves prepare for them to all be exposed. The length is appropriate, and I’m keeping it since with a pullover & boots it looks awesome for work. Anywhere it hugs tight there will be a slight sheerness, my bra’s outline was 100% visible.  Also, be careful if your packages are dropped in a shared area. To save packaging they ship without a box or extra bag. The dress was in its packaging, so you could tell exactly what had been sent."
4.0,It was good for the occasion. 1 time event. 1 star off because of the cheap elastic waistband. It just rolls on me. For the price they can do better than a flimsy elastic band.
4.0,I enjoy wearing this necklace with my wardrobe!
4.0,"Really like the poncho, got the medium and it seem to be just fine with space to change under. The neck hole is super small, which is the only annoyance"
4.0,"Nice, lightweight scarf in a very pretty blue, mostly pale blue with some dark blue outlining.  Not as long as I'd hoped but still quite pretty and easy to pair for wear all year around."
4.0,Decent strap. Quite large. For grown adults - tell your kids they'll grow into it.
4.0,I really love this but it came with a hole in the pocket. :(
4.0,Cute dress that is not too form fitting and can be dressed up or down.
4.0,"These are great!  The price was good and these are much more comfortable that standard masks.  Easy in and off, hold the shape and you can breathe easier.  They are thinner material but still a good battier."
4.0,"Had to give to my granddaughter, too small"
4.0,"This is a woman's cut shirt, so it is form fitting, not a loose t-shirt if that is what you are looking for.  The material is light, so great for hot days or to layer with something heavier.  The colors are great, and I didn't realize on the back it has DOCTOR WHO in rainbow colors, awesome.  Being 100% cotton, don't wash in hot or warm, it will shrink, and the sizes are true to form.  I love the shirt, and would buy again, esp. if they offered it in different colors beside white."
4.0,"Use for work outs,dries quickly"
4.0,I'd recommend getting a size or 2 bigger because this tshirt is very tight
4.0,Love it!! First good and easy to wear different styles
4.0,"Sized up due to the mentioning of Korea and it was still a firm fit. I love the dress though. It is a nice cut and decent fabric, zero stretch. Oh, also, it is not mustard, it is very very green. Like a light olive."
4.0,"These are cute, but some of the colors were not very attractive (a weird light mustard yellow, beige, gray). In addition, they slip out of my daughter's hair. These would be good if you child has a fair amount of hair, or not very fine hair."
4.0,A very pale green color
4.0,"no green coloration, no infection, its all good!"
4.0,Got them quick and they fit perfect
4.0,"These are great, but you may want to size up one or two sizes."
4.0,"This suit is adorable, but the top and bottoms seem to be on two completely different size scales.  I'm a size 4.  The smallest available size was medium, which is for a size 8 to 10.  The top fits...barely...and I'm quite small chested.  The bottoms are extremely large, and that's where I carry most of my weight.  I should be able to make adjustments with my sewing machine, but it just seems odd that the top is so much smaller in proportion than the bottoms.<br /><br />Taking the size factor out of the equation, this is a very eye-catching swim suit.  The contrast between the color and black is really nice, and I love the design.  It also appears to be very well made.  I think the stitching will hold up well.  The top is a bit hard to put on, but once it is on, it stays put.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It looks just like the photo.<br />Stitching looks like it will hold up well.<br />The color contrast is great.<br />The design is very unique<br /><br />Cons:<br />The fit...the top is just right, but the bottoms are very large.<br />The top is a little complex to put on.  Once it is on, it fits and feels great, but it takes awhile to get there.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased review.  Since I rely on the reviews of others when purchasing a product, the discount that I receive never effects my honesty. I would never want someone to get stuck with a product that they hate or weren't expecting based on my review. If it doesn’t work, or if there is anything wrong with it, or if it does not meet my expectations, I will include it in my review."
4.0,Like the style but ordered wrong size. Was returned
4.0,"These shades fit perfectly and the clarity is amazing, great pair of shades. definitely will buy again."
4.0,"Got this for my daughter cuz she broke her arm and couldn't wear a coat. It's a heavy material which is great for keeping you warm, but bulky for actual wearing as a coat. And she dragged the bottom on the ground occasionally and the sherpa material (100% polyester) lets all the sticks, leaves, and dirt stick to it.  For your average wearer that likely won't be an issue, but you should be aware that it will seemingly attract dirt.<br /><br />I have worn this a few times to quickly go outside to the mailbox on cold days and I was warm and snug. But it is bulky so other than wearing for general lounging or sitting around a fire I'm not sure it's practical - but my daughter seemed to enjoy it and not mind its weight. Also I found it hard to buckle her up in the car when this is on.<br /><br />But it is cute and my daughter wore this to the zoo and received many compliments (especially near the leopard haha)."
4.0,Keeps me cooler than expected
4.0,I think these are super comfortable but their description is not accurate. There is no fleece.  These are just regular leggings.  Good for winter inside but I would never be warm enough outdoors.  I would actually sleep in these.
4.0,"The lens fit just fine and are polarized.  They are plastic instead of glass as the originals are and the tint is a little bit lighter than originals.  That being said, $35 to replace a broken lens is a good deal."
4.0,"Thin fabric, more of a decor hat then an actual 'keep warm' hat. ADORABLE though. Fits a larger toddler head."
4.0,"It was too small, and not long enough in the waist"
4.0,Not sized as discription
4.0,It fits me very nice!the two splits at the sides was too high for my taste so i make them shorter....and i ordered  white and got an off white color...  other than that i LOVE  it
4.0,"Feels solid. Produces decent spark. Burns things adequately. Has an annoyingly high pitched squeal when in use, though."
4.0,"Cute and matches my Vera Bradley wallet, but thinner than expected and could be more  functional but it's OK for what it is."
4.0,"For a long time I had problems with skin irritation from belts, even those that claimed to be hypoallergenic. This is the first belt I've had that looks nice and doesn't irritate my skin. Great casual belt."
4.0,"Very stylish and fits well. Smooth, easy and very comfortable."
4.0,"It was ok. I bought this as a gift for my Mom who is 87 years old, but it was too hard for her to open. I returned it."
4.0,"At the time of this review, I was 5'6"", 173 pounds, 38DDD, size 12.  I bought this in XL and it fit perfectly.  The material is lighter weight.  Many of the PattyBoutik sweaters and tops I've purchased have material or designs that camouflage lumps and bumps.  This sweater is lighter, so not as camouflaging.  The length goes past my buttocks and the arms are generously cut.  The neckline is a moderate sized cowl.  The gray in the strip is a heather gray.  There is a slit on one side of the sweater to allow for buttocks of all sizes.<br /><br />I am keeping this sweater.  It's not as forgiving as other Patty sweaters but still really cute.<br /><br />The sweater is great with leggings.  If you wear jeans and a belt, you could probably see the lumps of buttons and belt buckles."
4.0,"I was really exited for these shorts but when they arrived two weeks later and small, I was disappointed. If your a US medium, get a large! This is coming from over seas and sizes run smaller"
4.0,"This ring is a very nice ring for the price! I was very satisfied with it. It fits true to size (although I wish it came in half sizes) I ordered a size 6 and I usually wear a 5 1/2. I got this ring because I work in a warehouse and I deal with heavy lifting, opening boxes, cutting shrink wrap, etc. I also wear gloves at work but I thought this would be a nice option instead of wearing the expensive engagement ring to work. Also, it looks nice if you decide to wear it along with other rings or jewelry. It's quite shiny! Arrived very quickly (as Amazon usually does) and I was very happy with this purchase."
4.0,Nice and soft but not super supportive for cardio.. best for less movement
4.0,"These are a nice, soft material and they fit good. It took a while to get my order because they were shipped from China. I ordered these for my son and fiance. Their opinion of them changed after a few days of wear.<br /><br />Cons: The legs are SHORT. I knew they would be shorter than a boxer/brief, but didn't realize they were made like a pair of boy shorts. At first they said it felt like their butts were hanging out.<br /><br />Pros: The legs are SHORT. They don't bunch and roll up like the softer pairs of boxer/briefs tend to do when you pull your pants up and once you get used to the way they feel, its pretty comfortable. They feel thin and breezy and should be good to wear this summer."
4.0,The pearl is larger than indicated in the picture but looks great on. Can wear with casual or dress. Do recommend purchasing
4.0,"They fit very well. The pocket is nice, large enough to fit just about any phone. My one dislike is after washing they still smell rubbery."
4.0,The coat is a little tight at bust and way to long in length but with alterations it will be wearable. Should have selection of 2Xl short
4.0,"I am 5'9"" 254 pds size 18/1x...I ordered a 2xl and it fit perfect..it looked great..my only issue was that there was a bunch of thread hanging from the bottom of the top and there was a small hole on the sleeve...I didnt have time to return bricks it was a last minute purchase..so just sewed thr hole and cut the loose threads...I received lots of compliments"
4.0,Very cute and comfortable to wear...
4.0,Is a good thing to buy for the price but be patience because it takes a long time to arrive
4.0,Great boot-- good quality-- the top part is a little loose and baggy around the thigh; it doesn't stick to the thigh-- it almost needs an elastic band on the back to keep the boot from slipping down or to keep the top from flapping around.
4.0,"Love the material, stretchy but still feels like cotton and does not make the feet too wet as other stretchy socks. I got them for my 3 and 4 year olds and we love them so far. the rubbery soles are ideal for running around the house whith no shoes on"
4.0,Great product. The Zippers are a tad hard to unzip. But great for the price!
4.0,Nice very clear and sturdy
4.0,"Very soft and flowing. Great value.<br />I got a purple one in place of the navy. I’m ok with it, but wanted blue."
4.0,"Nice dress , perfect for the summer. Just be aware that even with the lining is practically transparent."
4.0,The bag is cute and very durable<br />It isn’t a cheap material either which was surprising because of the price<br />Definitely a good buy<br />Will be buying other colors in the future
4.0,"I love the style of these earrings, but I am going to have to take them to a jeweler to see if they can be shortened.  I am very short, and the earrings come clear down to my shoulders.  I have several other pairs of threader earrings and have never had that problem before.  I probably won't have gotten them if I thought they would be so long."
4.0,"Surprisingly good quaility. The only complaint I have is the sides of the boob area kinda hang out and I’m a 38DD so I fill the top up but it still fits weird. And if you have a long torso I’d order a size up, I’m 5’6 1/2 and it’s a little tight torso wise. Also pines the top closed more since I have a bigger chest"
4.0,"Very pretty earrings, and a great deal for the money.  That being said, I found them to be extremely heavy. So much so, that my ear lobes hung noticibly lower when I tried them on. Also, the only true “beaded” portion of the earrings are the three balls at the very bottom. The rest of the earrings are metal with attached metal balls. If you look carefully in the photo, you can see it but I didn’t notice. I would have paid more for all beaded earrings that are more lightweight. I ended up returning them. If these two issues wouldn’t bother you, then worth the purchase."
4.0,"My daughter wore this to a friend's birthday party. It was a total hit!  Everyone said it was a ""statement dress"".<br />But be warned! It runs very small. My daughter is a size 4 or Small. We got her the Large and it fit perfectly. It was a little see-through too, so keep that in mind when choosing undergarments."
4.0,"The set was just as pictured and cute in person. The size was true based on other reviews. Only iss is there was small plastic pieces lining the hems, but I removed and no issues with hem line after washing."
4.0,it is cute style. but it did not fit me well.
4.0,"Thought I looked at the size chart they were for sure too small.  And, I thought all three pair had the line up the back. :-("
4.0,So cute! Easy to put on and off
4.0,Very cute! But runs big. Size down.
4.0,Bought this for my niece and she absolute loves them.
4.0,b/eautiful
4.0,Great product great fit. Would have given 5 stars but the print was smaller than I expected.
4.0,"Classy, small and simple"
4.0,"The color is a bright bright white. I ordered the size 8 because I don't like shirts to be tight around my waist. If you leave open its more than fine but if you tie it it is tight around your belly area. I am 5'7 132 lbs. It does easily snag so be cautious about that. My dog jumped on me within 3 mins of wearing it and ruined it already, BUT its a great top! looks very cute and I would buy another. I love the open back."
4.0,This was almost exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I wish it added was a dark red color but I like all the colors that did come with it and the band quality seems as good as any out there and better than the factory band because the clasp actually seems to be chrome instead of grey plastic which is on the factory band.
4.0,"This bra came is a suction packed bag that I had no clue what it was until I opened it.  The material is thin, bur does have a little support at the bottom of the cups.  I gave it only 4 stars because it has a seam down the front that you can see when wearing tshirts. But I bought another one in black"
4.0,The shorts are perfect but the bra runs small. I ordered a large since I am a 34DD/140/5'3'' but it's still really small. Other than that the material is great and I love the shorts.
4.0,Love this dress. But the reason I am only giving it 4 stars is because it arrived with a stain on the front that doesn't come out.
4.0,I have them 4 stars but I ended up taking the charm and making my own bracelet with it. I didn’t like the cord they had on it. The compass works well and it’s super cute to my liking
4.0,Kades version of Apple's link bracelet is very impressive. It turns your Apple Watch Sport into an impressive looking premium watch. I have the 38mm Apple Watch with multiple sport bands as well as the Milanese loop and leather loop but this is by far my favorite band. The craftsmanship for only being $30 is remarkable. I gave this band a 4 out of 5 because there are very small gaps between some of the links which isn't as noticeable on the silver band but may be on some others. I hear the black band is more noticeable due to the contrast of colors.
4.0,This product is some small but very handy...
4.0,This is definitely a great buy. It isn't too pricey and the material isn't itchy or scratchy. The only con is that the material is quite stringy and can easily come undone if not taken care of properly. I wear it around my hair as a bandana type item or around my neck. Included a pic to show how it looks.
4.0,"Great material - soft and lightweight.  Don't know if I'd call it a sweatshirt exactly.  It's more like a medium-weight t-shirt.  It's warm, tho.  =)  Washes well, didn't shrink.  Fits well.  Overall, very pleased.  =D"
4.0,I had misread description and thought the silver were sterling instead of overlaid with silver.  Other than that there were easy to use and good for what I needed them for.
4.0,"Wow!  This purse has way more space than I thought it would have.  It's super durable, and seems like it will last a long time.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars for me is because of the texture of the purse.  It feels very nylon-y.  I have some texture issues, and I thought I would have to return it.  It got better, but it still feels kind of scratchy and stiff to me.  I am willing to work around it because otherwise I really like it for the space and many compartments of the purse.<br /><br />I was looking to get a bigger purse because apparently as you get older, you need to carry around more stuff!!  This works great, and I still have plenty of space to fill as needed.  The zippers are not super smooth, but it is more like a learning curve, and I think they get better with time."
4.0,Thin material; but its cool to wear to work with a little sweater or blazer.
4.0,"Would’ve been 5 stars if I didn’t have to take toothpaste and a toothbrush to it to “unoxidize” it...it looked like it was 100 years old, but is now shiny and gorgeous! Definitely worth the price! Forgot to take a before pic, but you can see a bit of the oxidation left over on the bottom."
4.0,Fits pretty well.  I was hoping for a little more form fitting. Overall very comfortable.
4.0,Love the shirt and it is comfortable
4.0,Very cute but fits small and fabric is extremely thin.
4.0,"Nice solid, lightweight jacket."
4.0,"I'm 5'4"" and 145 lbs., 38 chest, 50+ y/o and I ordered a Large.  I'm often between sizes.  I feel as though a M would have fit comfortably.  This large is quite roomy on me.  The fabric is wonderfully soft. It laundered well.  It's just too big/sloppy on me to wear outside of the house."
4.0,"It's basically a pretty hat. It is worth what I paid for it. But, the main thing that sold me on it was the bow. Mine came with a very small bow. I'd be totally happy if the bow was the size it is in the picture. I'll be going to Hobby Lobby and find me another one. It doesn't hang down from the brim like the picture shows. There are a few wrinkles in the brim, but I think I'll be able to straighten them out."
4.0,It's great quality but it's too small for my 5yr old
4.0,Product was as expected. Seems like a quality product. I’ve used them on multiple surfaces and I haven’t slipped a bit. Would have gotten 5 stars but delivery was late to Amazon locker of all things.
4.0,It was a good fit. No problems but it took forever to receive. I forgot I ordered it until I ended up receiving it.
4.0,I liked the fit and the color.
4.0,seems to be color fast and breathes ok in heat.  Overall the hat was a good purchase but fits a bit small.  Hoping it stretches a bit over time.
4.0,Very soft and fluffy! This is great for winter since it gets warm after sometime. I would not use this in summer though.
4.0,So far so good.😊
4.0,"Love, love, love this shirt.  It is long enough to cover over a pair of leggings and it looks sexy on!  Great buy!"
4.0,We just got this and it looks great!
4.0,"Not too much stretch in material.  I am 5ft , 185lbs and 36d cup.  I ordered the XL and it fits comfortably.  Better care instructions would be good.  Possible reorder."
4.0,Love the hoodie but it is a little small so I would order a size bigger
4.0,I really like this dress! The colors are so bright and springy! I am only giving this a 4 star because the top part is more of a red red rather than a fuschia color which is a little odd with the mint. But overall I like the dress.
4.0,These are too soft
4.0,Very nice set. Is as advertised.
4.0,"The finger portion is longer than my hand and the thumb portion is shorter than my thumb so they feel a little awkward, but besides that they keep my hands warm so it does its job!"
4.0,"Adorable dress, did not fit."
4.0,Very nice and light. It runs a little small.
4.0,"This is a nice looking watch face, the band is ok. The only thing that feels super cheap is the clasp. But for the price 4 stars."
4.0,Bottom material is more wrinkle pron than I had hoped!
4.0,I would rather short ankle socks
4.0,not as soft as i was hoping but nice
4.0,"The style is really cute, and I am petite and it hits me at ankles.  It does run really small in the chest area, since i could barely zip up the back and so will have to order a Medium."
4.0,The quality and softness of the cotton feels really good. The stripes on the white are royal blue and very well defined. The color did not run when washed. It is a little small around the torso.
4.0,Runs Small.  Order up a size
4.0,"I haven't had this product long enough to test the durability of it. But I do like that it is light weight, which is what I'm looking for since I'm going to start winter camping for the first time in my life. I love the outdoors but the fact that I'm limited to camping only three months of the year irks me. Guess I better adapt.<br /><br /> These hardly weigh anything and gives me a way to keep my camping pack organized. I don't want my stuff just tumbled into my pack, and I don't like having a bunch of molle attachments on the outside of the pack to get caught on tree-branches as I hike through the woods. So it looks like these will fit my extra set of clothes, mittens, socks, fire starters, tools, etc. I got the three packing cubes, and the three laundry bags totaling in six ways to keep my gear organized. Its at a great price for what you get. The only reason why I gave it four stars was because I haven't had this long enough to test the durability, and for whatever reason the words Laundry Pouch are upside down from the zipper. I have to keep remembering that when I go to open the laundry pouch bags. Other than that, these will do the job I'm looking for."
4.0,"It's a little bigger than I thought it would be, but it's a quality made top and very comfortable."
4.0,"Who among us hasn't bought a pack of multi colored mustaches to goof around with their family?  These mustaches are legit, I mean, not legit legit - you won't be fooling anyone as to whether it's real or not.  But they go on easily and stay on.  I love the styles.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that there is no big handlebar mustache, like a really old timey one.  I would also love it if it came with sideburns - but now I'm asking too much.  These are great, good price no regrets."
4.0,This is a very nice chemise. Soft material that stretches a bit when you move. Very comfortable.
4.0,Wore the black one to a funeral while pregnant and got lots of compliments. It is comfortable and soft.
4.0,"Item was a little smaller than advertised, but worked."
4.0,Magnetic band is very nice.  Better than the original rubber band
4.0,Very nice unfortunately it was  to small
4.0,This is not the pleated together at the bottom type you hvae to bunch it yourself. It fits bigger than the size chart on me but it is cozy
4.0,I have worn these Robes for years and this one is great but seemed to run a bit larger than my previous ones.
4.0,"Excellent! Just as described. Looks great on the arm! The reason for 4 stars is because the band could’ve been better quality, but overall I’m pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"I love the look of these masks.  I have a darker one for the day time and bought this one for night vision.  The facemask is hard to detach and reattach, but my last one blue off my goggles when I had it up on my helmet at night.  Quality is not great, but it looks great."
4.0,Bought for my husband and he feels that they help with the glare from headlights. The glasses are a little loose on his face so we are going to attempt to bend the earpieces.
4.0,"Dress was just a little too tight but was still manageable, love it next time just gonna go up a size"
4.0,"It looks OK in person, but the area of the armpits sticks out in a way that my bra will be very visable."
4.0,"The adjustable headband is a bit tight, but otherwise it's great for my 4 year old with sensory issues. Overall I would recommend for the price."
4.0,love it but clasp keeps opening.
4.0,"The mask was really cool.  The only things I didn't like was that that strings in the back are thin, so it's hard to untie from behind and the mask was a little tight on my nose."
4.0,I love these shorts. They are light weigh and fit perfectly. Buy them you want be dissatisfied I ordered a medium but probably could have gotten small.
4.0,This shirt is an athletic fit!
4.0,Comfy and cute but wish straps were adjustable
4.0,"No mask is an enjoyable thing to wear.  Being part of a choir, I have found most masks intolerable.  They slip off your nose and they get sucked up to your mouth.  This mask solves solves both of those problems.  A plastic strip holds the fabric away from your mouth.  OK, it looks a little Darth Vaderish, but it works."
4.0,"This is a really good looking ring, and I like it. My husband was very happy with it at first, but after wearing it for a few days he said it's really not very comfortable. This might just be because he's not used to wearing a ring, so I hate to take off too many points for that. It's definitely worth the money."
4.0,It’s ok but not what I expect from George ( shinny looking so odd to me)
4.0,I bought it for family pictures for my husband. I was expecting it to be a bit more navy than a blue in color. The material was fine.
4.0,Good but not the best quality
4.0,Was a gift don't know how it's wearing.
4.0,Love the ring it looks nice. However I gave it 4 stars because I got married 3/18/18 and a week later my ring is already starting to turn brown.
4.0,"I love this bathing suit. Its so cute! I probably could have sized up, but its still cute and fits. Nice material and pattern."
4.0,"It's alittle small. I'm usually a normal size XL (I like my shirts to fit bigger, so technically I'm a L) and this is kinda tight up top. Kinda gives the vibe of pregnant lady tbh. Which I should've seen that coming, but I could help but order this! Fabric is kinda cheap, but it's very pretty and worth the money!"
4.0,"Good material but somewhat see through, my daughter had to wear spandex shorts underneath. Size M fit my daughter that normally wears size 3 in jeans."
4.0,I ordered black. It was surprisingly nice and did not look cheap
4.0,"the top is absolutely wonderful, except the sleeves are really right. I got the top on and it fits great everywhere else. Looks really put together with a lace extender top. I'd love to order another if they had more spring/summer colors!"
4.0,"Very cute. Wish the box chain could be a bit more shiny. As I'm allergic to non precious alloys, it seems to be silver."
4.0,"For some reason I thought I was going to get all of them, but you get one at random. As a sushi and cat lover, I was not disappointed with this product even though I was expecting to get 5"
4.0,I had ordered a half size up per recommendations. Blistered two toes first day wearing but one tod is the start of a hammer tie so not the shoes fault.
4.0,"Received quickly and in great condition. Could have been a tad longer, Bought as a gift for my boyfriend he is 6'7' it fit but just a tad short in my opinion. I would suggest a tall line, over all a nice experience"
4.0,Size up if purchasing -this brand runs small. This dress is comfortable. It verges on &#34;costumey&#34; so I don't wear it often (to work) but I do like the fit.
4.0,A little see through but I jazzed it up with a belt and leggings. Cute fall dress. Love the pockets!
4.0,"I’m small in the ribs but a bit larger in the bust, so the bust on this was a bit too small for me. I ended up returning this but think for anyone C cup or below it would be great."
4.0,For my joe exotic costume it was perfect! Highly recommend and not expensive!
4.0,To short of legs
4.0,"A really nice hat.  a comfortable fit (a bit deeper than my Tilley) ..  While the Tilley is a much better made hat, this hat at less than half the price is a decent value.  I like the look and feel.  This is a very well made hat and not that big a compromise to buying a Tilley."

Please also be sure to like this review if it has been helpful in your purchasing decisions.<br /><br />Received this dress in the mail this week. It is an extremely pretty pattern and very soft material. I really do love the look of the dress. I am used to clothes fitting a little smaller than they are sized for when i order on Amazon, but do not do that with this one. This one tends to run a little big on it's own, so since I ordered it a size up it is really pretty roomy. Other than that though, it is a beautiful and very pretty summer dress. Great addition to any wardrobe!"
4.0,I like the Big Cream 42mm Chronograph but the Blue strap makes it look in a lower end Alpina.. love the Black Strap I'm 7 1/4.<br />Good Choice..
4.0,It's just as cute as shown but does run a little small.
4.0,My grandson really likes the Warriors ctoc charms. They look like the picture. I ordered 1 packet but received and paid for 2 packets.
4.0,"This dress is cute and a good length, but if you have a large chest it doesn't fit.  I am a DDD and the top buttons are completely open (they can still button because it uses a stretchy elastic type closure for the buttons.  I'm going to try it with a cami or bralette underneath and see how it looks.  The material is nice and light but not see through.  I got the white with black dots and it is sort of dalmationy looking.  I think that the black with white would be much cuter!"
4.0,These shorts are comfortable enough but they ride  up just above my knees.  I was expecting more or a snug bike-short fit.  Instead I have to keep pulling these back into place.
4.0,"I like that this bracelet is a little unusual (I bought the silver stars).  Also very reasonably priced.  Be aware that the stars slide on the cords, so while you might start out with all of them facing up, they could end up on the opposite side of your arm."
4.0,Cute dress. Works with a baby bump.
4.0,I don't like the material it's made of but I'm loving the shirt
4.0,"Received this the other day, and I'm fairly impressed with its appearance. It's a nice heavy(ish) material. The color seems good. And it's plenty shiny. Hoping it doesn't change colors or change my SO's finger green or black. If it does, I will be sure to update my review/rating. The only thing I didn't like is that there were no half sizes...so I had to go with a 13 instead of a 12.5. We will just have to put a sizer on it, or take it to a jeweler and see if they can size it. It came in individual baggies and with a black little velvet pouch. That was nice. Hoping this ring holds up. We will find out. :-)<br /><br />I did receive this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I get no rewards or penalties for reviewing either positively or negatively so opinions given can be taken at face value."
4.0,4 stars only because the metal feels very flimsy & that this ring won’t have a long lifespan.. but it’s also cheap as heck and didn’t turn my finger green so that’s a plus
4.0,I really like it. I am 5’5 and 150 pounds. The skirt part is very thin material. But other then that I really do love it.
4.0,Fit is great but for some reason these pants are more stiff and starchy than the grey ones I bought
4.0,It was really nice
4.0,Fast and reliable!  A bit bigger than I was expecting
4.0,"Good heavy ring, not a thin light weight one."
4.0,looks and feels good
4.0,Absolutely loved this mask but my chocolate lab puppy decided it was her’s and stole it off to key hook and chewed it up 😭. Then I went to reorder it and now I’m being told it will not ship to me. 😢
4.0,Simply love the cap
4.0,Like the shirt and it fits great. Bought for my son and he wears it a lot.
4.0,Quedó justo!
4.0,"Cool looking shades, low price, fast shipping. Could use a spring hinge though. Overall good quality."
4.0,"As expected, good 👞"
4.0,"Awesome dress, but not a true white like I was expecting."
4.0,Great product! The bands are nice quality and work effectively. I just wish there was more detailed instructions on how to use it correctly.
4.0,Fit fine and feel good.
4.0,These were so cute on my grandson!
4.0,I got this pj set for my daughter to wear at her birthday party. I would get a size up and the material is ok but not promising.
4.0,"Cute dress overall, just not very flattering on the body."
4.0,"It is a very good hiking pant. Thick, warm, and breathable. I washed it twice. It still seems good. Although I wasn't warm enough in the November cold in Yosemite and Zion (I mean it wasn't snowing, just below freezing). Another layer would have been helpful (I have lower body temperature than average people)."
4.0,"I thought the color would be darker than it was, plus I think I was sent a very old stock. Aside that, I believe the case is a good one."
4.0,I had to return the XL and purchase the XXL for my husband as it was just a little too snug on him. I recommend sizing up anyway if you're planning to wear it over another shirt.
4.0,Would like if material was a little heavier.
4.0,Pretty. Lava stones hold essential oil scents for awhile.
4.0,the only thing i don't like is that the ends of the sleeve don't have any tightening mechanism.
4.0,These boots are very cute.  My daughter is 2 months old and even though they are size 0-6 months they don't fit her yet which I expected.  The size is probably more like 3-6 months. The velcro makes it easy to put them on.
4.0,The waistband as abit big
4.0,I liked the design of this frog but he is not very stable. My little girl ripped the lining off trying to open it. The clasp is very hard to open at first. The stitches are not tight either so it feels flimsy. The ninja headband was a hit! It was the perfect length and my son is going to use it for Halloween. The stitches are secure on it and makes him go into ninja mode.
4.0,"I adore this necklace, but the pearls fall off and it’s sad because I hate to miss the fun effect of the necklace."
4.0,Very soft and made nicely. Order 1 size up if you don't want it to fit your curves.
4.0,The color is gorgeous and it arrived quickly. I had a hard time keeping it on my daughters head however.
4.0,"Very cute dress, but op is very flimsy. You may need to safety pin at the underarm, besides that I love it"
4.0,"I wore it couple times in the infrared sauna and felt pretty comfortable.  The velcro corner is a bit scratchy when I put it on the first time, so I cut the sharp corners into the rounded shape and no more scratchy.  So far I am happy with the purchase."
4.0,I buy these every Halloween.  It's great to have the kids with these walking around the neighborhood.
4.0,"I love how warm this is but it let's off fluffs! Wore this to a wedding with a burgandy dress, it looked classy enough but I got fluff on the suit of every man that came anywhere near me. Looks good and comfy."
4.0,We gave it as a gift.
4.0,"The shirt too a long time to arrive. It's good quality. Very soft. I wear a 2X and it fits too tight. One size up would have been perfect, that's why I took away 1 star."
4.0,LOOKS REAL HAVE HAD OVER 30 DAY AND HAS NOT CHANGED COLOR.
4.0,"It's a dress I can wear to the office. I get so many compliments on it.  Pockets would make it better, but I love the fit, the texture and it's easy to wash and wear."
4.0,Good material and fit correctly.
4.0,Nice piece but was a bit tighter than I expected. Actually returned it but was well made; only returned due to financial hardship. Would recommend 👌
4.0,Worked well for my nieces play. She used it twice. Needed to be adjusted. After her jumping around lol. It lasted good build and material.<br />Please hit the helpful button if you found this review useful so I’ll know to leave more  Thanks!
4.0,Great wallet recommend to anyone who doesn’t want a huge wallet.. Very organized.
4.0,These run small so it's a good idea to go one size up.  They are adjustable with the velcro strap.  Got them for my grandson and he really liked them.
4.0,"I ordered this set to wear to lounge or sleep in. It is soft and comfortable.  It is a fairly lightweight, stretchy type material but durable. The washing instructions say to machine wash cool and not to use a dryer.<br />  The pants fit about like I expected and I like them alot. The inseam is about 6 inches long which is great especially if you are taller.<br />  The shirt is quite a bit bigger than I expected (goes almost down to the hem of the shorts, maybe 2 inches above) but it is still comfy and looks cute knotted at the bottom. The sleeves are roomy and go down to the elbows. The top is also quite a bit wider than I expected in the size I ordered, there are several inches extra on each side.  So I'd order a smaller size or two if you want it closer fitting.<br />  As it is, the set is very nice for lounging. It is a little bit see through, but nude undergarments solve that. It's not real noticeable. Overall this is a comfy, oversized set of loungewear."
4.0,Cute dress! It's cuter than the picture. My daughter picked this and it fits perfectly. It hits below her knees and she likes that it's a little longer. She says it's comfy and pretty.
4.0,its a little small but nice
4.0,Nicely made very attractive ring
4.0,"This is the second set of replacement lenses for my Antix. These look fantastic and come in a hard plastic case with the soft cloth pouch. They are dark, as in very dark, when worn. They block the sunlight perfectly and fit snug as a bug in the frames. For the price you'd be hard pressed to do better. Would be nice if they were polarized, but for the cost I can't complain."
4.0,This does fit true to size. I had found a very similar dress on a pricey online boutique but just didn't want to part with $50 just for a dress. The only downside is it is a little clingy so garment lines underneath do show but that doesn't bother me. Would probably need a light weight slip. Otherwise this is a great deal
4.0,"Not as bright, but super cute."
4.0,"scarf and gloves ok, but ha twas very big"
4.0,Awesome mask. I get alot of compliments while wearing it. Best part...it's mesh so it's great to wear during workouts (mask mandate state) Highly recommend.
4.0,I like that it needs a screwdriver to unlock so good for a security of not falling off
4.0,"It is my own fault for thinking this could be worn as a tshirt dress out in public. It is very thin and way too short, but too long to wear with jeans. It does work well with a tank top underneath and a pair of leggings!!It was not actually to small but too short as dress"
4.0,I wear a size 38 I ordered xxl and they fit I have a bigger but and full thighs so tight there bit otherwise good. The liner sonewhat scratches sensitive areas though. I do like the length and fit.
4.0,"These socks are great! I always wear no show socks, especially in the summer to help keep my legs cool and comfortable, so these are perfect! The quality is very nice and the material is very breathable which will help keep your feet cool and comfortable. Seriously! Do a blind folded test. Have someone set out several of your socks and feel them and I bet you can always tell which ones are these socks and I bet you will always say that these ones feel the best. I just happened to do something similar while I was doing laundry and I grabbed a pile of socks and I could tell right away which socks I had grabbed. One of the problems with no show socks as most of you probably already know is that they tend to slide down and bunch up in your shoe as the day goes on. Its always hard to keep them pulled up in position because of how low they are, so if you do a lot of walking or running you might be taking your shoe off several times a day to readjust your socks. That IS NOT a problem with these socks. These socks stay right in place all day long!<br /><br />The only issue that I have with these socks is that they are very thin.  As in you can see your foot through them thin,  seriously.  This isn't that big of a deal but just know they aren't going to provide much cushion.<br /><br />I give these socks a solid 4 stars and will probably be ordering additional pairs because I think they are absolutely great!  The only reason I took off 1 star is for how thin they are.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest review.

4.0,These underwear are stylish and smooth.  Most little girls will love them.  My daughter can't stand seams and says that the leg openings on these are itchy.  Thank goodness for a wonderful return policy!
4.0,Like the dress very much but<br />Didn't fit me .returning.
4.0,"I like this a lot! I used to think that waist trainers were for vain and shallow people. But the more I read about it the more I wanted to try it and see what all the fuss was about. This one, although only $20, is made very similarly to the ones celebrities trust (latex, steel binding...etc). It really sucks you in and snatches your waist but what I like best about it is that it helps support my lower back and makes my posture 10x better. Definitely worth the purchase."
4.0,"I just received this purse today and the color is great - a dainty pink with brown accents. The purse is mid-sized, bordering more towards small than medium. It seems well made, and as a bonus this purse came with a nice storage bag (that if you're like me - you won't use for purse storage but could use as a tote bag for the kids or carrying groceries.) I wish the shoulder straps were a bit longer, when held on my shoulder the outside strap keeps sliding down. I was able to store the long cross body strap in the inside zippered pocket so I can change styles on the go if necessary. I like the easy twist closure rather than a zip-top as it will be quick and convenient. Overall I'm happy with this purchase - as it is going to be a cheaper alternative to Walmart or Target purses, and looks/feels like better quality too!!! (Pictures show style and what I was able to fit into the purse - do not rely on my pictures for coloring as it is poor lighting)"
4.0,I like it but not what I expected. Some reviews talked about it being to short and the one I got goes down to my knees. Was expecting a shorter causal summer dress not one to wear to church. I’m 5’6 for reference.
4.0,If you can go a size up. It's super sexy and cute. I tied the bow around the center of my bra so the top part of the dress doesn't shift. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.
4.0,"Did the job, used for quinceanera. The bracelet was a bit big for the girls."
4.0,Very pretty works well with any outfit.
4.0,The earrings themself are gorgeous! The post are small and the backs wont stay on and I dont have backs yo fit
4.0,"Beautiful necklace only complaint 14kt chain is to short. Im purchasing new one at local jewelry.<br /><br />Love the pearl and diamond.  However, the necklace length more suitable for a 6 year old.  The hasp is impossible to open and close on tiny loop.  I visited several retailers for a longer chain and bigger hasp, no one has a small enough necklace to fit inside the pearl hoop.  They suggest I go to a jeweler to have one custom made.  A good deal turns into added expense.  Very disappointed.  2 out of 5 rating."
4.0,SEEMS WELL MADE. I LIKE IT. WORKS EASY.
4.0,Itsctrue to size
4.0,Very cute shirt but I might just have a long torso and big arms. Wasn't long enough and not roomy enough for the arms. It ended up ripping near the armpit.
4.0,Good sun shade
4.0,"Surprising stylish and solid watch, especially for the low price. Arrived working perfectly, nice box, easy to remove bands to fit."
4.0,My daughter loves her socks.
4.0,"Great dress! It fits almost perfectly, except it's a little too roomy in the bodice by the front of arms."
4.0,Makes me feel perfectly 80's. I love the acid wash. The only down side is that the skirt is a bit small. I'd size up at least one size.
4.0,"My 13 yr old has double ear piercing. I thought these were great. They are a little thin, but she said they were easy to put on. Now she is excited about it looking like she has three holes. I hope this will curb her desire to get that said hole."
4.0,Beautiful glasses but the shape was much to small for my face so they had to go back.
4.0,Purchased for my hubby and love the earrings. Only down side is the stem of earring is really sensitive and fragile. Perfect size and just as shown in foto
4.0,This is a well made and very attractive bag.
4.0,"When it arrived, one of the straps was broken. It was an easy fix with just a needle and thread. The fit was perfect and it looks amazing!"
4.0,Hold cards together well!
4.0,"Great bikini, looks just like the pics,great quality, would buy again!"
4.0,"REALLY BIG STONES  and they are all clear, lots of bling with this."
4.0,"Need banding on wrists and ankles. Otherwise, they fit well. Just loose around the wrists and ankles."
4.0,"It got here in a very timely fashion .. It's a little bigger than I thought.. But I'm using it for a lip ring, so it's not bad."
4.0,"It is a thicker v-neck square t-shirt, which is not see through. Not fitted at all, but a nice shirt."
4.0,"I would not recommend - I’ve been wearing ear pieces like this for a really long time (between fairy ears, ear cuffs and other items like this) if you don’t have prior experience wearing stuff like this I would not suggest getting this item- 3 reason why (short answer if you don’t want to read everything basically the thing is gonna fall off and it’s a pain to get in place)<br /><br />1.when you get this item you need to form and shape it to your ear- by doing this you also have a chance of possibly breaking the item by bending it wrong - unless you’ve dealt with stuff like this before and know what your doing so you need to shape it<br /><br />2. Not very secure- this does not like to stay on your ear and tends to fall off pretty easy- it has an ear cuff but the placement of the cuff is too low and doesn’t really sit in a secure place it ended up on my ear lobe rather than the harder upper / mid part of the ear<br /><br />3. It’s not all that comfortable and again with it not being on the ear  securely  It doesn’t help with the comfort its not that it hurts its more so annoying and feels like it’s slipping  off"
4.0,LOVE these for my purse! just wish I didn't get 3 cheetah prints...
4.0,A bit large but oh so warm and cozy.
4.0,"Same price you would pay for sunglasses in the drug store, but better quality.  Lenses and frame are sturdy.  Great peripheral vision coverage.  Unless you have a very petite face these should not appear too big.  The sunglasses come with a carrying case and a cleaning cloth.  I accidentally dropped the sunglasses face down on the concrete and was surprised to find that there were no scratches.  Overall a very good value for the price."
4.0,I don't like the cheap golden buttons
4.0,This was a gift to someone and they fit just fine.  she loved them.
4.0,I loved it in the picture. When I got it in the mail it was a bit smaller than I thought and its almost too light. It feels like It could blow away.
4.0,Love the wood frames but the lenses could be better.  I get compliments on them all the time.<br />Comes with a case but it's thin bamboo and useless
4.0,"great details, hard to get over my ear. It (I think) was made for smaller ears because it bends my ear cartilage."
4.0,"Surprisingly comfortable with a decent fit. I had read the reviews and wasn’t sure what to expect, especially since the packaging was very manufactured (think cellophane bag). Dress fit well - great for travel and events or occasions where you want to be dressier than jeans but not over the top."
4.0,You get a lot for your money but expect some to be defective. Overall a good value.
4.0,Bought according to the size chart. Which ended up being a bit big in some spots. Overall I'm happy with the bathing suit. I bought with the purple top as it reminded me of a mermaid!<br />The bathing suit seems to be well made so that's a plus. There is a sticker liner in the crotch area so that made it seem like it was taken care of and they thought of our protection.<br />I'm excited to wear it out soon!<br />I'm including a few photos I tried on over clothes for a preview.<br />I did receive the bathing suit at a discounted rated in exchange for my honest reviews and options.
4.0,"Love these laces (the perfect amount of elasticity for my picky running feet, and many great colors to choose from) but not the locking mechanism, so I buy the laces and combine them with iBungee locks."
4.0,"Sling bag is good but after 2 months of use the top front compartment elastic came ondone. I a redoing my review. After finding out about the problem I had I was contacted by the owner of LPV, and they replaced the backpack no questions asked. I was blown away at the gesture. Awesome customer service.<br />Updated review: the replacement bag ended up starting to fall apart as well. I carry my wallet, keys, medicine,  power bank,  small bottle of cologne."
4.0,"This is a good looking casual top.  The material is somewhat thin, but not see through.  The colors are as pictured.  The back is slightly longer than the front, covering you to the top of the thighs.  I am a bit top heavy and the top fits really well.  For ladies with smaller chest sizes this top may be a bit loose.  Love the sleeve length, a bit below the elbows."
4.0,Last year I got the tr 505 boots a friend I work with told me to get them we both work on tug boats and gloves pants shirts (boots) dont last about a month before it comes apart or cant hold up or rotes from the nasty water and every chemical I work with so I got the boots and they held up great  im still uesing them I had to go 6 days with out takeing them off and never had a problem just they dont repel water at all  even in light rain with in a few seconds your feet are wet but there great to run in and they can hold up a year worth of my gob when most boots last weeks to a month  then ill buy more
4.0,"Comfortable, easy to read and looks good"
4.0,I got this pant for my son it is soft and warm. It fits as expected and feels comfortable.
4.0,"This dress was cute and nice. Love the scallop bottom and the dark blue color. Could work for a lot of events. For me it was too long and hit below the knee so I returned it. I'm 5'5"""
4.0,Though the pile isn’t as deep as I’d hoped it is really soft and comfy. It is the 2 layers of material with both being soft it’s not exactly as I’d hoped.
4.0,"Awesome shirt, but it was too small for the hubster."
4.0,"Was a little small, but my dad still loves it!"
4.0,"Ended up returning for a different style, looks great but the fit was not to my personal preference."
4.0,"Nice durable band. The picture shows a free rubber piece to go over the watch piece, this I did not receive. Other then that great watch band."
4.0,Very pretty my daughter loves it.  But the ribbon fell off in one day.
4.0,"I wanted the 12 months, but it was out of stock, so I ordered the 9 months.  To my surprise, I accidentally received the 12 months instead.  The outfit is really cute, but you can tell it's a little poorly made.  One of the bows came off the socks in the dryer.  I had to glue it back on.  It came with two headbands (bonus headband or something).  The one with the crown in the picture was too tight for my daughter's head, so I took the crown off and put it on the other headband.  Overall...cute!"
4.0,"The hat is wonderful, but the bill is too curved for me."
4.0,Very cute and will work for ballet class.  My daughter likes it
4.0,nice little light a good fit
4.0,Bought as a gift for my mother and she loved it!
4.0,"SUPER cute costume for our daughter's Halloween. She loved, and looked so great in it. Very happy with it, and the price we paid."
4.0,This product is made very well and looks great.  Unfortunately we had to return it because of the size.  (We ordered a men's XL and it fit like a Medium).  It's a shame it doesn't come in a larger size.
4.0,So cute! Fits everywhere! Wire is a bit short but i love it
4.0,"My wife is very happy with this product including size, color and material"
4.0,This is a cute out fit. What I mean is just that an out fit. not bathing suit with a mesh layer or even nylon but more like a plastic diaper cover. but I would recommend it.
4.0,Covers face properly and it’s comfortable to wear.
4.0,"Super cute dress! Perfect LBD for a night out in Vegas that I had! The only thing is, because the sleeves are so lacy, mine started to stretch where the armpits are and create bigger holes. Some people might be uncomfortable with the length (it is a bit short) but I’m 5’3” so it wasn’t too bad. Taller girls might have a problem if they don’t want it too short.<br /><br />Other than that, the dress is really flattering!"
4.0,Very hard leather. Tight for credit cards and bills. Did not come with strap.
4.0,Spacious compartments that make access easy.
4.0,"This skirt would have been fantastic if not for the super-long belt. The fabric is a soft, lightweight flannel. There's a paper bag high waist. The length hits just below the knee. I found the fit to run a bit small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"" and 153lbs. I'm wearing the large.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,"These are so lightweight that I forget I have them on. They are big, which I like, but others might not."
4.0,Great little shoe but unfortunately won’t last long. My granddaughter wears size 11 to 11 1/2 so I bought a 12 and it just barely fits
4.0,I should have ordered a medium (my usual size) or even a small. The large was waaay too big. I ordered it to wear with leggings and wanted it to cover my butt. I could have achieved that with my normal size.these are sized like woman's sizes and not Junior's sizes. Very good quality though.
4.0,"This is a really cute romper, very flattering but I didn't realize that the solid colored ones have no stretch so it wouldn't zip so the way up but I think if I had ordered one of the patterned ones it would've been perfect"
4.0,The dress was very nice and comfortable.
4.0,"Fit was as expected but I wish the manufacturer would use a higher grade and more dense (heavy) T-shirt stock for these shirts... obviously, this would likely alter the price point.  The print work was very well done, perfectly centered on the shirt."
4.0,This suit is CUTE.  It fits me on the bottom perfectly.  The top portion fits a little strangely and I would not recommend for someone with a larger bust.  I'm a small b and feel like there could be more coverage on the sides.  It is very flattering!
4.0,"Looks just like the picture, very cute!  It does run a bit small so if you want an oversized look I’d order a size up.  I’m 5’4”, 155 and DD, this Is just a tad more fitted than I hoped, not very long in the torso."
4.0,Fits perfect. I'm 5'9 145lbs and medium fits perfect.
4.0,I love these pjs because of the side pockets on the top.  So useful - and they are comfortable.
4.0,Did not fit well. Despite purchasing a larger size description does not match advertised size
4.0,So comfortable and breathable
4.0,These are very nice and well made. Just what I was looking for...
4.0,Beautiful dress. Top quite big at shoulders. Ordered XL 5’5” a little over 180lbs. Bottom fit pretty well.
4.0,It is a great gift idea and my daughter loves it.
4.0,"This basically a marble. I expect in time the map will likely wear off. But for now, it's lovely."
4.0,"Over all these are really fun pantalonies, but I have to echo other reviews on this design that the waistline should not simply have half an elastic band in the back and nothing in the front. The manufacturer should really take note as this is not a great design element and would be a very simple fix."
4.0,It gives my watch a really unique look
4.0,"Un reloj muy bonito, sencillo, un detallito que le encantó a la persona que lo recibió."
4.0,Material was great not see thru. Thick enough to wear shapewear if need be.<br />I wear a size 10 & I’m 5’1” I purchased a medium<br />it comes a lil below my knee but I ruched it’s up and made it work.
4.0,Perfect for gym/dorm/whatever shower scene.
4.0,Nice bracelet could be a little bigger though
4.0,Not a heavy sweatshirt but should be fine.
4.0,I bought it for 2 uses. I needed bottoms n I could use them as a cover up as well. They fit ok. Rolled in back some what. Over all great buy
4.0,"My husband loves his new accessory.  It is a little large, but that helps it comfortably fit over the hand."
4.0,I read the product size carefully. It fits great.
4.0,Like it very much but it runs a little large
4.0,"Loved it, it fit perfectly and my son looked so cute! but unfortunately my son put it in the wash... It fell apart."
4.0,My husband loves these shirts..They are good work out shirts cause they are so light weight. Will be ordering more in the future..
4.0,"I love this!<br />However, the  gain broke fairly early on. I was able to add a new key ring very easily though"
4.0,"a bit tight, but nice"
4.0,"For $89 it was a great watch BUT the band was horrible. It is kind of a hard plastic. I replaced it by a silicon band from an old watch that I have and doesn't work anymore but had a nice, good and comfortable band.  Much better now...."
4.0,"This dress is really cute, the design and colors are beautiful. It is a tad short for me to wear as a dress, and the pictures on the model are accurate. I'll probably wear it while on vacation as a bathing suit cover up."
4.0,Super cute but the belt is hard to tie and keep tied
4.0,Suede leather (fake) looks real but it’s not the zipper on the jacket is extremely hard to zip. The jacket is stiff . Overall it is not real heavy. Runs a little small
4.0,I actually liked this dress I had purchased for a wedding but returned it . It was not dressy enough but I should have kept it for s different occasions.  It was super cute.
4.0,I like it ok though prefer heavier knit.
4.0,"Zipper is on Left  ( women's) side...<br />Runs a bit small. Ordered a 2xl. Fits like a xl.<br />Pockets are big , battery pocket is large .<br />Only 3 heating zones but warms up good .<br />No battery included...<br />But just about any phone power bank should work ."
4.0,"I love the print and material of this shirt. Although it's see through, you do need to wear a cami underneath. I'm 6&#34; and this shirt is shorter than I wanted it to be. Although too cute to give up, I'll probably have my mom sew lace at the bottom to give it more length."
4.0,"Not blue lenses. Nice looking, fits well but the lense color is dark grays"
4.0,"This sweater definitely keeps me warm. The material is a little itchy for me, but maybe I have sensitive skin. It has a nice V-neck that isn’t too low. The sleeves were a little weird for me towards my hand. Overall this is a decent sweater."
4.0,"They are cheesy, but that was what we were going for. Possibly great for kids party but we used them to hold bowls at a pirate party."
4.0,I like this band alot.  It was easy to adjust the size and it makes the fitbit feel more durable and break resisant at my job.  I also like the look. So all in all i think its a great product and would recommend to others
4.0,"Used it in Paris, and loved it, kept all my documents, passport, maps, pens and money safe and near and in plain sight near me. Back in the States it hasn't gotten much wear. Nothing wrong with the bag, perhaps just a cultural thing?"
4.0,"This product fit my fiancée well when it arrived, upon washing however, it did shrink in length. He is still able to wear them but just a little shorter now."
4.0,The only reason I took a star off is for the completely unnecessary side zipper. Otherwise a very cute and comfy dress (It’s is soft t-shirt like material).
4.0,A little heavy for where I live. But very sparkley and warm.
4.0,"I have been wearing these glasses for years now. I can no longer find them in the store. I like the green lenses. They are not too dark. I am a woman and these look great on both genders. I gave them 4 stars as I have had several of the nose pieces and side pieces break off. I keep them in a case, am very careful with them."
4.0,"I bought this as a band for my Pebble Steel in Stainless Steel.  I got it mostly so that I can wear my Pebble during exercising since sweat doesn't mix well with the leather band that came with the watch.  ***Also, this does NOT come with a screwdriver for changing the bands, contrary to other companies that do include one, like Truffol.<br /><br />The good:<br />Well made, high quality silicone.<br />Width and length about the same as the original leather band.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The silicone band for some reason picks up a lot more dust than my other silicone bands.  Not sure why that is.<br />The part of the band that connects to the watch are just a tad wider, so they don't fit into the grooves smoothly.  Instead, you have to jam them in.  The rod will slide through still and you can lock it in with a screwdriver.  However, because it is so rigid in there, there is less flexibility and your watch will not lay flat on the table or desk when you set it down.  The band will prop it up a bit.<br /><br />Overall impression:<br />Pretty good band replacement for the Pebble Steel, but the connectors are a bit rigid and the band picks up too much dust."
4.0,"Cute and seem to be sturdy. The nose bridge might be a little narrow, but it's not an issue."
4.0,"These work great! They were inexpensive and I use them everyday! My only complaint is that (it maybe my face, not Sure, ha!) Is that they get foggy because they sit do close to my eyes. But other than that they rock!!!!!"
4.0,I get a lot of compliments on these boots. I do wish they had a zipper but then they would not be riding boots I guess. But overall very comfortable. Good shoe choice.
4.0,"We were the HIT of the neighborhood ordering these for Halloween!  Literally, people were lined up at the door to get the cool lights.  Had quite a few duds or I'd have given 5 stars."
4.0,"Overall it’s a great strap.<br />My only complaint is that it does not include spring bars.  The hole for spring bars seemed designed for seiko fat bars, but I do not have those to confirm. Standard spring bars feel a little loose.<br /><br />Very sturdy thickness, yet supple/flexible.  Great feeling material that is not a dust magnet like silicone straps.<br />Buckle is unsigned, but of nice quality.<br />Very happy for the price."
4.0,Nice quality leather strap that will stretch over time.  The anchor itself is pretty big.. I wish it were a tad smaller and didn't have that gosh awful virginstone stamp on it.
4.0,I bought these socks to use with my Vibrams.  They are very thin and do their job.  The only thing I don't really like is the top part of it because it is thick.
4.0,"I just got my first pair of prescription glasses and didn't want to spend another $350 for sunglasses, so decided to try these.  They work well to cut the glare.  My eyes are very light sensitive and the transition lens in my glasses wasn't enough, so this pair of clip on sunglasses was the closest in size to my glasses and works very well.  I like that they flip up so that I can see my touch screen on my Prius without having to take them off.  For the money, these work!"
4.0,I would have loved it more if i could get her size
4.0,"Good, but the filter is annoying."
4.0,These sunglasses are so dark. Which for me is a good thing. I have sensitive eyes and it is hard finding sunglasses dark enough. They are a little too big for my face that is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.
4.0,"This was the wrong size, small instead of large. I had another I could give it to for the quality was great. I ordered another in large hoping I get the right one this time."
4.0,Nice and cute swimsuit. I bought this for my 11 year old daughter. She likes the color and the frills at the sleeves and leg area. I got the size 11-12 but she said it felt a little too small. She needed a size up. She weighs 90-100 pounds. Cute swimwear.
4.0,Gave it to a friend.
4.0,The shirt part is very thin and it’s see through if you wear a dark shirt under it so don’t do that. It’s very comfy tho! And the pouch looks really well made!
4.0,"I have larger hands for a woman and these gloves fit perfect!  I had previously purchased a different brand in size large and they were too small so I was very happy when these fit perfectly.<br /><br />The pressure these gloves provide is also perfect. Feels so great on my hands!!<br /><br />The only reason I gave these 4 instead of 5 stars is because the seam at the tip of each finger is on the inside. Therefore, the seams slip under my fingernails while I’m wearing the gloves. This doesn’t hurt but it is extremely aggravating."
4.0,Bought as a gift for bf and he loves it! Hoping it continues to impress him.
4.0,"Great fit! The zipper pocket fit my samsung plus size phone, which is great! They did cover my knees..."
4.0,"I am a plus-sized guy with a size 40 inch waist, so I was careful to look at the recommendation of the correct size to buy before purchasing.  The chart said for a 40-42 inch waist, I should buy an XL, which I did.  I got them and immediately put them in the washer, which I do with all new clothes.  I was careful to follow the washing and drying instructions to minimize shrinking, but they are 100% cotton so there is only so much you can do.  I anxiously put on a pair and discovered that they fit me very snugly and the opening in the front was stretched slightly open from the shorts fitting too tightly.  That said, they are very high quality for the price and the weight of them is quite substantial. In fact, I'm sure they will make a for a nice pair of warm underwear when the weather gets cooler, but they are a little thick for summer wear.  Bottom Line:  I'm glad I purchased them but am slightly disappointed by the fit.  The picture makes them look like they are very roomy and that was the type of boxer I wanted.  Be careful when ordering and go for a size or two above your desired size, unless you are looking for snug fitting underwear."
4.0,"This belt is made of quality materials, from the leather of the belt to the design and material of the buckle.  Only have this issue with the automatic buckle mecanism, sometimes it just starts to loosen, and its because the little lever that open the buckle its too easy to move with your clothes or body. It needs to be more secure and open only when you use the force of your fingers.  Gonna buy a brown one soon."
4.0,"I bought this product, I would like to say 6 month ago, but I may be wrong. I love the necklace, the only problem was that the clasp became, tarnished and almost coppery looking after two weeks. I never wore it in the water or in the shower to I don't know why that happened. But otherwise I love the necklace and its a daily part of my wardrobe."
4.0,These glasses are perfect for pickleball.  They are not too dark but a good shade.
4.0,The stretch was nice
4.0,Material was well made
4.0,"Good color, fits pretty well.  A little tricky to get into place at first but otherwise very happy!"
4.0,Earring were beautiful! Fit very well on a 7 year old!<br />There was a delay which was frustrating but we are happy that they arrived!
4.0,Great shirt ok color
4.0,Get some compliments with the watch but sometimes I have to adjust the time cuz it randomly stop functioning sometimes for some reason
4.0,prompt delivery; item as expected
4.0,"I'm a boot snob and the place I normally buy affordable boots was taking FOREVER to release some cute ones this season so I picked these ones up.<br /><br />These don't look like pretty instagram-able boots, I'll just throw that out there right now. They look more like combat boots to me with a heel. They're fine if you have jeans or something layered on top of it to cover the &#34;laces&#34; part. But again, that's just me.<br /><br />I do however like that they're water proof, I haven't had a chance to test this but but it's going to be so helpful once it starts getting really cold here! And I definitely wouldn't want to risk ruining my prettier boots for that. They're comfortable, which is always a nice thing when it comes to boots and anything with a heel and even in my pregnant state I don't feel like I'm going to break my ankles wearing these out. Thank goodness.<br /><br />They're comfy, they're black so they match anything, they're waterproof! I'm pretty happy with them!"
4.0,Comfortable but size up.
4.0,"This is a lightweight, high quality, very comfortable robe. I highly recommend it."
4.0,Great looking and great price
4.0,It is cute bit the material is a little stiff
4.0,"Nice little ID holder. The leather is very soft, and the product is very well made.  I can keep the holder in my front pocket with my Iphone and it is comfortable. It fits enough important items so I dont always have to carry my bag with me."
4.0,love to buy another one
4.0,"These are a cute and comfortable boot with a sturdy heel. For the price, they feel better made than I expected. I wish they went up slightly higher on the ankle, because I do think they look slightly awkward being so short. Please excuse my goofy looking socks in the pictures lol…but even with more fashionable socks, the boot hits at an odd spot on the ankle.<br /><br />Overall, still well made and with the right styling could be really cute."
4.0,Good suit for swim team practice
4.0,Like the bracelet bit pink is very muted and doesn't stand out from the white very well. Definitely not what you expect from the product pictures.
4.0,The material is a little heavier than expected. Looks good on those with full figures.
4.0,The style is super cute but it was a bit too big and baggy on me. I ordered medium and I'm 5'2 140 pounds. The adjustable fasteners on the sides of the waist make it so that you can pull it tighter in the waist area and give it a feminine look without having to have a belt on it. The pattern on the top half is pretty and the hood lining is super soft. The pockets are also lined with a very soft fabric which was a treat. It's a very nice coat but just a little too big on me.
4.0,Love it.  I just wish it had a zippered change compartment.
4.0,"Beautiful top but crazy small, i wear medium and cant even fit in a large i should have probably get a XXL. Im 34B."
4.0,"Not made for short women, will need to get this tailored."
4.0,"These are too big for my wife's face, but she's petite. If you're a tall woman with a big head, they'll probably work for you. They are well made and the lenses do a good job of blocking the sun. They are similar to the Foster Grants you find at drug stores."
4.0,"The cap was nice but too small. Good color, but I would not buy again"
4.0,A great casual dress. Very pleased
4.0,"I had been searching for a perfect set of chokers for some time now.  Chokers have been coming back into style lately for girls and the styles offered seem to be endless.  I came upon these on Amazons website and they seemed like a great deal.  For the price of $8.99, the buyer receives 8 necklaces that come in a variety of styles.  Customers can also pick different packages which add extra necklaces for one dollar more.  An added perk is that it was offered in Prime as well, which means it will be on your door in two days if you are a member.<br />The package was delivered on time and all the necklaces were accounted for.  They were packaged very carefully to avoid travel damage which was much appreciated.  Each necklace was in its own plastic protection bag and all eight necklaces were placed inside a nice draw string bag.<br />The details on these chokers were exactly what was expected, they looked identical to the pictures which was excellent.  One of the best things about these chokers was that they had so many different styles that can go with many different looks.  When searching for a necklace set, I think it is important to offer diversity of style which these really delivered on.  My personal favorite was the thick black line with the thing line and a triangle hanging off of it.  It was easy to wear with casual clothing during the day and still looked nice when dressed up at night.  The quality of the necklaces themselves seems to be good, they hold up in the center and do not rip which is important for fabric necklaces. It also is a nice added bonus that they include a waterproof one which works well for everyday wear.<br />The only complaint about these chokers would be their clasps.  When delivered they all seemed well constructed, however since beginning to wear them two of the clasps have broken.  It is not hard to fix them with some tweezers and glue, but it was still disappointing that the clasps could not hold up to basic wear.  This wouldn’t deter me as a consumer since the issue is easily fixable.  While it’s inconvenient, the price on these chokers is just too good to beat.<br />Overall, these necklaces were worth the buy.  They had minor flaws, but the diversity of styles and price overpowered any construction issues they faced.  As a consumer I was very satisfied with the purchase and would consider buying another set."
4.0,These are very soft but not any sort of compression to hide tummy bulge. I'll just wear a long shirt over these to hide my muffin top.
4.0,It is nice. The material is not thick or too thin. I went a size up which fit perfect.
4.0,"light weight, strong, webbing easily dries, copious amount of storage and PRICE compared to similar<br />vests......"
4.0,You should order next size up from what you normally wear. It is a little snug.
4.0,"Pretty, as advertised."
4.0,This bra is much more comfortable than other underwires I’ve worn. It fits well and it’s pretty. I plan on buying more.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:bcf434bee5555ca46d49b0d13758b14b]] I love this bracelet but the quality is not great. Second day I wore it, the charm bumped/hit the shopping cart and fell off. Cute though! Was able to fix it for the most part."
4.0,Product quality is very good and fits perfectly.
4.0,Adorable with dresses or pants. Cute with jeans! Fun to wear at Christmas!
4.0,"Got this bag for a medical forum in California. Was big enough for a water bottle, a notepad, a textbook, and all the assorted bag items. I was really happy with it's carrying capacity. Had no smell when I got it. Only issues I had were the strap digging into my shoulder after carrying it around for a little while and the inner lining tearing at the seems after prolonged use. Bag served its purpose and I still use it today."
4.0,"I bought two in large. Im 5'5"" 145 pounds. Returning the one i didnt wear for a smaller size. Very comfy. Thinner material than i thought it would be, but i wore a little tank under when its cold."
4.0,"Only reason I gave this hoodie 4 stars instead of 5 is the sleeve feel like they're a little short, but I still religiously wear it. Super comfy."
4.0,Too short.. please make talls.
4.0,This is great quality. Only thing is the piece that goes in the ear is thick so it takes some getting used to but I am definitely keeping it
4.0,It look a little faint  after the second wash.
4.0,it’s a little cheap / flimsy feeling but you get what you pay for! it’s super cute and comes with two keys to unlock/lock the heart shaped charm. I love mine but if you are someone who gets irritated or turns green by cheap metals (like I am) I wouldn’t wear it for prolonged periods of time
4.0,"Looks nice enough, but the fit could be better (somehow too thin and too loose concurrently), and any extended time walking around in them leaves my feet aching. That being said, they are reasonably priced considering."
4.0,I took a gamble with this shirt but it paid off! It's cute and it fits me well. The sleeves are a liiiiiittle bit tight but i don't mind it too much - it's not uncomfortable. it's not too see through as long as you wear a nude bra underneath.
4.0,I bought based on the sizing on the page but had to return. The top is super cute!
4.0,"I bought this to use as part of a costume for children's theatre, and it worked great.  It was cute, fit well and was stretchy enough to fit a variety of head sizes.  And it was a bargain for the price."
4.0,Very nice fabric and color
4.0,"These are very comfortable and cushy.  I was told that I needed to wear some foot support all the time.  I think these do a fine job of supporting my feet.  ONe thing is, I wish the insole was replaceable because they have developed an odor (probably because of the lambs wool).  I took the insoles out and washed them which I will do periodically.  (I normally don't have foot odor!)  ;-)"
4.0,These insoles are comfortable and fit my arches fairly well.  Using these in low hiking boots.
4.0,Socks are comfortable and fit well.
4.0,"The material is SOOO soft, good solid construction and the size I ordered fits; however their sizes are not normal US sizes.  I wear a 14 in department store good brands, this was a 2XL and the top was a tad bit smaller than expected.  Still fits and I will not return, but sizing is why 4 stars not 5."
4.0,Good looking . Usual look
4.0,"I am happy with my purchase. It is a slim fit shirt, I ordered a medium and the length and sleeves are long on me. I am 5’6, 140 lbs. 36D and slim on the bottom. This shirt is a  good for casual night out or hanging with friends. It is nicer than wearing a regular plain long sleeve  t-shirt. It is a soft comfortable material. I wore it with a pair on high waisted jeans, but probably would work with a pair of stretch pains too. If you don’t want your bra straps to show wear a strapless bra. The cutouts will show your bra straps because they go from armpit to armpit practically. As I said good casual shirt, cute to wear out to a restaurant or bar. It has that detail to be a little bit more than basic and the shirt is not revealing, but is form fitting."
4.0,Found it was smaller than i thought.
4.0,"Our measurements for reference are:<br />147 lbs, 5'4"", shoulders 17, bust 39, waist 33, hips 39. We ordered a size X-Large per the size chart and that was a mistake.<br /><br />Yes, we relied upon the size chart but instead we should have used our better judgement. The Cobalt Blue print looked really appealing to us. We are shorter, so we like the idea of tights that don't have full-length legs. But it turns out that they are pretty baggy on us, and bunch up around the pelvis and upper legs.<br /><br />The size chart suggested that an XL would be closer to matching our waist and hip measurements so that's what we ordered. What we found was that the cut was more generous than necessary in the hips, and the waist was pretty loose with nothing close to any tummy control. Other than that, the material is super-stretchy and despite that fact the fabric is not see-through at all. If you put your hand in the pocket and make a fist, you will see the impression of your knuckles poking through but that's all you get. Speaking of pockets, unlike many sets of leggings, this pair only has a pocket on one side. Such is life. All in all these pants are cute and so all things considered we're rating them as four stars."
4.0,"The dress is very sheer, so no dark undergarments. However, overall a great summer dress to wear to on casual occasions."
4.0,"My girls Aunt loved this. The only thing is the piece with the words on it, doesn't stay in place. Otherwise, it is really nice."
4.0,"I like these, don't get me wrong.  Probably GREAT for golf for which I think they are intended.  I needed some support for my tendons inside my elbows, referred to 'I think&#34; as 'golfer's elbow.&#34;  Anyway, I used them for resistance exercise.  They helped some, but my needs are for a tighter, more firm compression.  These are okay for light, light workouts if you're agonizing some."
4.0,"This dress is gorgeous; however, the bodice on the dress was too tight around neck, arms, and chest."
4.0,"I think this top is so cute. The fit is fine and the material washed well. It had a little spot on the back but thankfully, I was able to wash it out so it’s not a big issue. Would definitely purchase again in different designs/patterns."
4.0,That's good was expecting better quality
4.0,My son prefers these over briefs
4.0,They are very nice! Look very sharp!
4.0,"Great dress! Belt is very flimsy and doesn't stay in place, so keep that in mind, but the dress is fun, and I paired it with a slip to make it extra poofy and fun. It's also fine without one, and I have received many compliments on it."
4.0,Super cute but somewhat large.  She is currently wresting between 12 and 18 months but this is a little on the big side.
4.0,"I ordered what I thought was large enough for my husband, but they fit me perfectly. I usually wear a size 9.5 in men's I ordered these in a size 11. Be aware of that when you are ordering.<br />Also, they sent insoles to go in the shoes, putting them in makes the shoe slide off of my foot as there is really no room for the insoles. I just wear them casually around home sans insoles and they work fine."
4.0,"Unique and comfortable. I went one size up because I wasn't sure if it ran small or not, but I would recommend sticking to your regular size. My only issue is the middle has a weird spandex fabric that I was not expecting. Great buy overall though."
4.0,This dress is worth the money its comfortable and the material is really good quality. I'm going to buy the other colors!!
4.0,It was very nice...but ths size chart is way off.
4.0,Overall I'm pleased. Dress is not cut like in the picture. Neckline is way to high and will have to be altered. Lace pattern is straight not cut like picture. Order 2 sizes up. Make sure to check measurements. Arms are way to tight but again can be easily altered. Plan on uploading a picture once I make my alterations.  Honestly though I was expecting much worse. Nothing a few adjustments can't fix. It's for renfest so I have time. Arrived faster than expected as well.
4.0,Product is made very well! Super sticky and held on tight. I had to return though just because my boobs did not sit right once fully dressed.
4.0,Decent cap compared to what I paid for it.
4.0,"It fit perfect. I got a lot of compliments at a wedding I went to.  I had to get it shortened because I am short, but that's normal for me."
4.0,"Really like these bracelets, bought one for myself, then ordered four more for my sisters and Niece. I've gotten many compliments on how pretty they are. The message each conveys, will be a nice reminder to each giftee, that I'm thinking of them and wishing them well. The only thing is; avoid getting them wet, when washing your hands, the silver plate will come off, so be careful."
4.0,"Smaller and thinner than I anticipated, but very easily forms to wrist shape/size as needed."
4.0,"Super cute, washes well, don't plan on using this as your coming home outfit."
4.0,Nice bling. L-o-l. It looks just as pretty in person. It's not heavy btw.
4.0,"Very detailed and pretty! It's not as small as it was described, but it's pretty and still fairly delicate."
4.0,My friend's grandson likes it.
4.0,"This is an excellent tool for buying shoes online.  If you measure correctly (aside from how individual brands fit) it should nearly eliminate shoe returns.  We bought this for COVID times so we don't have to take the kids into shoe stores.  Works great - follow the instructions.  (I learned a thing or two about shoe sizing even, so that was cool.)  All that said, the $55 price tag seems a bit high - I would have loved it if it were closer to $40.  But that said, we paid for the convenience of sizing shoes at home."
4.0,"Love the style and color but so much light enters the frame causing me to not see clearly.  Good for when you are in the car/shade but when in direct sunlight, can be distracting."
4.0,"UPDATE: These masks are great but seller is price gouging compared to others of equal (and even better) quality that I've received from other sellers.  I just received some for just $4 a piece free shipping and they are the EXACT SAME MASKS!<br />Price gouging!! For SHAME! 😡<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE these masks.<br />They are exactly as pictured.<br />Sterile and individually wrapped. 👌🏼<br /><br />HOWEVER, they were described as a 3 pack at the time of my purchase, and I ordered 3 quantity which should have been 9 masks total, and I received only 3 masks and I see the seller changed the description. 🙄<br /><br />Just an FYI: One pack is now one mask."
4.0,I loved it.  But this is my second order on it...the rose fell off the leather strap.
4.0,got this for my son and he loves it.<br />only issue is i borrowed it and it does fit large on me. otherwise good product overall.

4.0,As other reviews stated the tanks straps are too long. Fit as expected after reading reviews and sizing chart.
4.0,"I wear a size 16/18 in women's clothes. I'm 5'6 and my chest size is a 38C. I ordered a size XXL in this one piece lingerie. Hot pink in color. This definitely runs small. The XXL is more in between a large and a xlarge. It didn't fit me so I ended up giving it to my sister. I had asked her of her opinion of it and this is what she said. It fit her well other than the breast area, it barely covered her breasts. It fit around every curve on her body. She said it's very soft and comfortable. The stitching was all in the right places and in the front between the breasts is a really cute diamond accent charm as well as down under her belly button just above her pubic area. She said she really likes this one piece sexy lingerie. It made her feel very sexy.<br />The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I did follow the sizing chart and any other time I've ordered lingerie I've always gotten a XXL and most have fit me perfectly or was slightly smaller. But other than that this is a nice one piece lingerie and since I wasn't able to wear it and give to someone who could and that likes it a lot I am giving it four stars.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,pompoms on the neck are a little awkward looking and laying. I snipped them off easily and looks much better
4.0,Fit perfect on croc shoe
4.0,"The material snags easily had to take off my rhinestone bracelet, necklace and earrings otherwise the dress would  have been ruined."
4.0,"Good for the $$, but beware that these fade a lot of dye when you wash them."
4.0,Really cute and sturdy but the glass is too large for readers.  Looking over the top (as reader wearers do) is nearly impossible.
4.0,"Very pleased with the AKA adjustable bracelet, thanks so much!"
4.0,"Love this dress! I wasn’t sure on size and ended up ordering one size up, should have stuck with smaller size. SUPER comfy. I wore it out to dinner with friends and everyone could not believe it was bought on Amazon."
4.0,Too short and wide. But fabric is soft and wonderful as well as attractive. Price is right too. I’ll have to do something to extend length. Nothing like paying for something you have to put further into
4.0,"Great idea!  A little tricky to maneuver every component to the right spot, but once you get the hang of it, fire!  I love to give these as gifts!"
4.0,Loved the necklace. It was a gift for my niece and she absolutely loved it. The only thing I didn’t like was the chair isn’t as durable as it should be.
4.0,nice fit.  great buy
4.0,pretty dress  fit my granddaughter good
4.0,Colors are great on this swim top but it does fun small. DRJ
4.0,Cute and stayed up without a problem
4.0,They worked out well.
4.0,Nice flip flop.  sides hug the feet and the front isnt too tight.
4.0,It is beautiful but very big for me.  My husband bought it for a Christmas gift.  Make sure you read the size before you buy.  I am using it as a make up case for travel.  I prefer a very small 7 inch size bag.  This is around 13 inches wide.  Still it is beautiful no denying that!
4.0,Fit as just I expected. Love it but quality is ok.
4.0,Super cute but are rather wide. They fall right off my face if I look down
4.0,Wish sleeves were longer. Like otherwise.
4.0,"some reviews said ran small, I am 5'8"" and 160 and I like the fit, ordered large. liked that there were no loops, so that I can where without sash without it looking lost. sleeves were incredibly long and twice the size at wrists, not able to fix with the button wrap, I folded up and was happen, as they were long. The lightness was great for that transition and goes all the way down to the knee. much better than my 3/4 length for staying dry. also without getting sweaty. The color looked a little gray green on my computer so was very pleased it was a rich green color without being too bright. Very satisfied, but i dress a bit quirky"
4.0,Great earrings but I thought they would be long
4.0,Really cute and fits well but feels cheap and the zipper feels like its constantly about to break
4.0,"Almost because I'm short (5ft), so I had to get hemmed; otherwise fit perfect. Got this for my 70s birthday party, received so many compliments. Pardon the crop; oddly, I have not one pic of me alone at MY party."
4.0,My 6 year hold daughter wore this dress for our wedding. I got so many compliments on it. Everyone wanted to know where it came from. They couldn't believe when I told them it was from amazon.<br /><br />It is made fairly well. I did have to add a snap to the belt to make it snug on her and I had to sew the flower on as the pin broke when we received it. That's why I went 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />I definitely don't regret this dress as part of our big day.
4.0,Absolutely love this! The perfect gift!!
4.0,Great Price..
4.0,Loved this necklace until the chain broke. Hard to find a replacement chain to fit in the loops at the top.
4.0,"I spray painted mine a hammered metal because I wasn't crazy about straight gloss black. It worked out really well. It has tons of room. Some of my necklaces are too long for the bottom row, but there are so many hooks that I can just pick which works best. I wear clip-on earrings, so I've clipped some to the leaves, which has been a bonus function for me. It looks really pretty and makes my jewelry so easy to find and choose from!"
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter.  Very soft and comfortable.  However, they were a little short."
4.0,This is a great product however could really use a good backing pad for the front of the pelvic area to reduce some of the impact and rubbing  that occurs during vigorous use ... best products we’ve found yet
4.0,a little hard to get on and off on your own
4.0,"Lace on neckline is a tad itchy, which is why it got 4 stars. Otherwise love it. I have an almost identical Apt 9 brand shirt in maroon that cost about 3 times as much, so this is a great value."
4.0,"The muted colors, dark gray/black shimmer [more gray than black] and hammered gold tone discs can be worn with almost any color or pattern. This necklace can easily add interest, accent and update a sweater or simple turtleneck yet it can be worn inside or outside a collared shirt [the chain can extend 9 inches].  The necklace can be worn on its own or with hoops or studs but also can be worn with tassel earrings for an exotic statement look.  The price and versatility [looks per wear] I feel make it a smart purchase."
4.0,Great earrings for the price!
4.0,I like the overall fit of this suit.  The only complaint I have is the padding in the top moves from time to time.
4.0,"inside liner is poor quality,,,I had to take it out and made me one of good quality material....but good for the price for a leather handbag"
4.0,"LOVED these but they bend super easy, mine got ruined. :c"
4.0,"my first purchase (july 2020) was in khaki option which no longer seems available. i loved it because of the cloth it was made out of. i don't know my fabrics, but you can see in the pictures that they're made with different fabrics. My sister liked my bag that she purchased two for herself -- a black and light blue one -- in april and june of this year respectively. My khaki bag was getting dirty from taking it to work every day so I decided to buy myself another one practically a year later however as I stated the one I wanted was no longer available. It seems like all the current bags are made of the same cotton fabric now. It's a shame as I really liked the smoothness of the neoprene/synthetic fabric. I sincerely hope they come back!"
4.0,"This hood is very warm and washable, so easy to take care of. However, it is not as long as it appears to be in the picture--definitely doesn't fall on your shoulders as portrayed. But I tuck it into the top of my coat, and it's fine."
4.0,"Plastic snapback, but great trendy looking hat for the price!  I have a big head (so I'm told) so hats are difficult to find that fit, but this one fit and looked great."
4.0,Runs small and doesn’t keep me as warm as I expected
4.0,"My ankles hurt from flat feet. I have arch supports in my shoes but what about my dedroom shoes? A slip-in didn't work because of the cushioning. Well, this one does because the support is built in. Good job!<br /><br />Update 11/15: I initially gave this 5 stars but now that winter is upon us the air is drier and these shoes generate a LOT of static electricity. I get zapped every time I touch something metal and I keep my house humidity at 60%!!!"
4.0,"First and foremost the fabric is very sheer (meaning it's see through). Getting past that, the dress is beautiful. It appears to be more of a Heather Navy color which I was happy with. It makes it more of a summer casual dress. There are side pockets that fall just at the hip so be warned pear shaped ladies, this dress may accentuate your hip/belly area, however the dress is shaped to allow anything under the bust to be flowy. Some reviewers called this dress a &#34;tent&#34; and I can see why. If you are thin and toned definitely order 2 sides down. For reference I am pear shaped. 5' 4&#34; in height. I weigh 152lbs. Size 36B bra and my measurements are 36(Bust) 32(waist) 41(hip). I went against the size chart recommendation (XL) and ordered a Medium. If I would've went any larger the dress would've been too large and tent like."
4.0,"I wear an 8.5 but I ordered a 9, these shoes definitely fit like an 8.5.<br />That said these are totally cute, I love the color.<br />I would buy these again."
4.0,Constructed well a little large but functionality great
4.0,The bag was bigger than expected but worked out well. Sure if the bags were discolored but overall they were just what I wanted
4.0,This is a very comfortable shoe
4.0,Beautiful multi layer necklace. It does tangle very easily.
4.0,"This will be given as a gift. The packaging looks a little different than the picture shown but the product itself looks very impressive. Nice bright, bold colors. Very satisfied."
4.0,"The color was right on. It is not a heavy weight sweatshirt material like it looks in the photo. The arms were quite a bit long, but do-able, just didn’t seem in correct proportion with the body of the shirt."
4.0,pretty. a little smaller then expected.
4.0,"Just like the picture very cute and elegant, rather simple. I would've given it 5 starts but the size is a little small(ordered a size 8 & it fits more like a 7)<br />Still not disappointed I love it."
4.0,"The skirt fits good and washes well. It's not too short, just the right length."
4.0,"I love this robe. It is comfy and soft, and I love how light it is. Unfortunately, after about a month and a few washes the stitching on both pockets started coming undone. I had to sew both of them. I wouldn’t buy this if you don’t have a sewing kit at home"
4.0,Very soft material. Pretty color. Runs a little small.
4.0,"Can’t address durability as I haven’t really stuffed these but they’ve held up well on 3-4 trips. Big benefit is organizing your clothing, which any packing cubes will do, but I like having the option of compression, especially with winter wear like bulky sweaters. The sizes are very useful and the zippers and seams appear solId."
4.0,but the zipper look like it going to break
4.0,"For the price, this is an amazing mask if you have a tiny face and head.<br />If you are a child or small-headed teen, this is for you.<br /><br />Small-headedness aside, my head is huge and I was still able to stretch it to fit.<br />Its remarkably flexible, doesn't feel unbearably tight after being stretched/secured, and provides decent coverage.<br />I will keep it as a reliable but comically small backup.<br /><br />There are so so many of these bike masks on the covid market now, and all at varying qualities.<br />I've actually bought the neoprene and mesh bike mask models from 7 different companies, and all of them are different.<br />They are like snowflakes - even no 2 filters are the same unfortunately!<br /><br />So - based on my growing collection, this mask is in the top 3 (for small heads).<br />The thickness is decent.<br />Vents are durable enough (that's the one piece that's standard across manufacturers).<br />Filter is good quality (small though, so your replacement filters likely won't work).<br />Nosepiece is legit.<br /><br />This is an inexpensive gem for you small-headed lucky in masks people."
4.0,Muy lindo y fresco
4.0,"It is a bit bigger than it looks, but still wearable and nice.  My wife loves it."
4.0,These are really cute and fun I enjoy them
4.0,"A little to long, but nice sturdy shorts and the color is great."
4.0,"I would love these capris aside from the fact that they don't fit the same as the full length version I have at home (same brand, type, etc).  The material is still very nice and a good thickness and they are very comfortable.  However, a medium in the full length 90 Degree by Reflex yoga pants fit me perfectly and a medium in these capris is a bit snug.  I am 5'8&#34; and typically wear a size 10 in pants/jeans.  I think I would have been happier with a large in these capris.  I do like the Navy color though.  And LOVE the hidden pocket for a cell phone and house key."
4.0,"Slight stretch to the material, very flattering. A bit wide in the shoulders so, I ordered a size down."
4.0,"Just didn't like the fact that someone's old comb, rubber band hair ties and fingernail file was in my (I thought was suppose to be a) new bag."
4.0,Fit good.<br />Graphic is too high on chest.
4.0,"the watch looks good i thought it was orange but it looks more like pink, and i wish it was a bit bigger"
4.0,"I love Bomber/Trapper hats because they are so efficient at keeping my head warm when it's really cold out. This is my first fur Bomber/Trapper hat. After reading reviews I expected the hat might be larger in size than what I needed. I have a small petit face with a hat size about 6 5/8- 6 7/8 depending on brand. There were no size options on this hat and despite reading reviews on larger size I purchased it anyway because I so wanted to try a fur or faux fur Bomber hat for the freezing days of winter. The hat arrived and has a tag on it marking it as Medium. The materials appear to be of good quality and the sewing is sturdy and well done. The fur is soft, clean and has no odor. I'm sad a rabbit lost it's life for this hat, I can only hope it was also used to feed someone and not killed merely for fur. A faux fur hat would have sufficed for me. Though the hat fits too large for me and can easily be spun around my head like Linda Blair in The Exorcist, I did not return it because I love the style and warmth. When windy or real cold and I need it snug, I can tighten it to my head using the chin strap and loop system. When it's not too chilly out I wear it without using the strap because it's more comfortable that way and it's the way I wear my Bomber hats most of the time unless it's windy or below 35º. I do wish I could have purchased a Small but this hat will suffice because of it's other great qualities."
4.0,It is of good quality.  It is a generous size for a medium.  The snaps are a little hard to open so I have to be carefully not to yank them because I might break them.  I have been looking for a house coat like this for a long while.  I would have preferred a solid color like the previous one I own but this was the best looking one I could get now.
4.0,Very fashion forward like them slot....
4.0,"Loved the sleeve and dress length.  Not crazy about the fabric, it's heavy and hot.  The dress would be perfect if it was more of a summer fabric."
4.0,Got them for my wife’s vest!
4.0,This necklace has the brightest stones in it I have ever seen!  It's really a beautiful piece of jewelry but because the stones are so bright and large no one would believe it is real.
4.0,It’s pretty but not real high quality
4.0,Its a cute dress and a great material. The waistband is too big so it feels more like a long-sleeved t-shirt dress.
4.0,"Very cute! The sleeves are a little tight on me, but still looks really nice."
4.0,Super cute. Super comfy. Pants are big but I roll the top and they work. I would buy them again.
4.0,it is a little small but much prettier than its predecessor
4.0,"I love this product bc I have a smaller face size. It fits perfectly but, I ordered a clear tinted black and black with blue on the bottom but I got a black with pink under instead of blue and got a black glass which I didn't order. I recommend it but I just got something I didn't order."
4.0,"I really wanted to love this because it was almost exactly what I was looking for. The fabric was soft, comfortable, and it fit well. My only problem was that there was an elastic inside around the top of the waistband that dug into my tummy and it was too tight and a little uncomfortable. If you have a tiny waist I’m sure it wouldn’t be a problem but that’s not my case. Wanted to love it but couldn’t overlook the waistband elastic and eventually had to return."
4.0,Good product for storing my glasses and contacts lens items.
4.0,"Very cute, not soft, but will be worn once or twice only. Size is hugeeee for 0 to 3 months! These bottoms will fit one yr olds, the onesie would fit 6 to 9 months."
4.0,Lightweight and good coverage.
4.0,"Size Reference:  I ordered a large.  I am 150lbs and 5'2&#34;.  Usually wear a size 8 or 10 pant.  These are a little baggy in the leg, taking away from the mesh window effect but it fits comfortably in the hip area.  Might have needed a medium.  This also might work better for a taller woman because the legs would be stretched farther down the leg."
4.0,Very nice but seemed small maybe wrist of a child not adult.
4.0,Great accent on dress
4.0,Very happy with the top.
4.0,"Only reason I gave this 4 instead of five star was because I read in previous reviews that it fits somewhat small. I got a medium to prepare for that and it looks kind of big. I’m 5”3 and 115lbs.. otherwise great shirt, soft and cane way before scheduled shipping"
4.0,Like the style and material but run large
4.0,"Very feminine. Matches my rose gold watch I purchased earlier. Excellent price as well, purchased it as a sale item"
4.0,Several weeks of wear and wash and still holding  the same as day 1. No softening agent used and air dried. Actual capri length and elastic band is very comfortable. Highly recommend. I plan to purchase 2 more.
4.0,couldn't believe these were comfy.
4.0,"Very cute, but a little hard to tell it's a shoe in that size."
4.0,This is pretty cute and fits well.  My only issue is that the fabric wrinkles easily and is very thin so anything you wear under it shows.  I just wear a tank top under it and it reduces the bra lines that I hate.
4.0,"Rice bead bracelet is good quality and very pretty.  Could have probably gone with the 7 inch length,  rather than 8 inch. A little too long,  but OK."
4.0,Worked great for about a year then top edge started fraying
4.0,"For the price, they are ok. They are high waisted and stay in place. I don’t like that they are a little thin and don’t seem to hold me in."
4.0,Nice  tee
4.0,This is very cute but runs small (and I was sent a size smaller than I ordered).
4.0,"Material is very nice and stretchy, squat proof. I would only get dark or patterned ones if you don’t want a verryyyy obvious cameltoe.<br />I am 4’11 and 108 lbs"
4.0,"I got these for my son who is just learning to drive. The fit is a little tight around the temples. Lost a star for the tightness. For the price and the fact you get two, I would highly recommend these for a spare set."
4.0,"I actually like these shorts. Not the highest quality material, but they are cute- deep pockets a plus."
4.0,Makes my face look weirdly narrow
4.0,Looks better in photo. The stones look more realistic in the photos.
4.0,"Inexpensive, easy to use digital watch.  When I first got it I didn't think I would like the color, but its grown on me and now I end up wearing it over a black Casio watch I have.  Only gripe are the numbers are a bit too small."
4.0,"The legs stay in place, the material is great, & I love the waistband. One drawback is the awkward center seam that goes down the front to the tiny crotch gusset & up your butt crack. It constantly feels like a wedgie & would be very revealing, in a very unflattering way, under leggings. Another is the weird seam makes it impossible for a panty liner to stay where it belongs."
4.0,Fits good and feels good!
4.0,Good if u want to loss belly fat
4.0,"it looks kind of cheap and the sleeves are too short, but it's still cute and fashionable."
4.0,I tried it on my 2.5 year old and my 1.5 year old- the 2T was too big on both and they immediately were freaking out that it was off the shoulder. They both Wanted it off asap. It’s a beautiful dress but in my experience toddler girls aren’t gonna last in this dress without it falling down or them getting upset about the way it feels.
4.0,"Great little bag for gym clothes or taking running. It holds a lot for a little bag. also the strap is very comfortable. I can fit all my gym clothes and towel, also I use it to take to work from time to time."
4.0,Heavy material perfect for controlling a breeze. Nice material fits as expected
4.0,Most great for jewelry making.
4.0,Purchased for indoor cycling. Fit is as expected. The clip on on the shoes is not even. It is higher on one shoe which makes clipping into bike awkward but it does seem to interfere with peddling.
4.0,This is just so so. The fabric is very average. I will keep it but only because I waited to late to send it back.
4.0,For the price they are great~!
4.0,This is a cute bathing suit and it comes with a sun hat …Jamaica here I come
4.0,"I like this product, quality is good for the price. Only thing I didn't like was that it came much smaller than expected. I love big necklaces and this just isn't as big as I had hoped. Other than that, color is true to description."
4.0,"Cute top, was a bit see-through and smaller than I expected."
4.0,"This is a nice, light to medium weight sweater that is a good basic to have in the rotation. I would say the fit is true to size. My son is almost 6'3"", 175lbs. for reference and he is wearing a t-shirt underneath. It was a little more fitted than expected, but he does have a very broad back. It feels soft enough and I am glad there is some breathable cotton in the mix. I like the olive green color for fall."
4.0,Very pretty but I gave 4 stars because it’s not so pink more of a mauve. The packaging is great and they sent 2 sets of extra backings. They won’t match perfectly with my pink top but still pretty enough to keep.
4.0,"This top is extremely comfortable, fits true to size, and great for weekend wear or with jeans. You could even dress it up with a skirt and heels and a nice necklace. I really like to stop and would like to buy it in other colors."
4.0,"Very pretty!  I didn't like the chain, so I swapped it out with another silver one I had and really like the look."
4.0,"It didn't fit my husband, but fits my eight year old daughter.  She loves it."
4.0,"Better than I expected. The frame wasn't straight and I had to fiddle with the left knob to get it to adjust the lens when turning. There is some noticeable light reflections but it is not really distracting. You should make sure the glasses are adjusted everyday because the adjustments do shift by themselves. Wear them close to reduce any distortion and the rubber grips prevents them from sliding down. When looking through them, it's most effective when you look straight at your object. Compared to prescribed lens, it has some ways to go, but it's adjustable and it works quite well. With improvements, these glasses could be a household product for people with myopia/presbyopia."
4.0,Really like the style and comfort 9f the priduct. Was easy to replace or swap bads for different looks
4.0,good n love it
4.0,Linen see through
4.0,I ordered larger than I wear. Good quality.  Sleeves are a little long. Over all good buy.
4.0,The Celtic Tree of Life necklace appears to be made well. I just received it and only worn it once but I received a few compliments that day. The delivery came quicker than I expected too.
4.0,"I'm 5'7&#34;, 145 lbs, and I ordered a large just because I don't like to feel restricted. It fits cute, but I definitely could have gotten away with a medium. The only reason 4 stars is because it shows my whole world and I didn't realize I needed a light slip underneath."
4.0,"I originally got these for yoga, but the crotch area gets a little tight in certain poses, so I mostly use them for sleeping now, which they are perfect for because I'm never too hot or cold in them. Very thin and soft material, but yet pretty durable. Would purchase again!"
4.0,"Girlfriend Review:<br />These are really cute! Love the key ring type, the colors and the sun and moon shapes. Not too big of an addition to my keys and gave the other one to my sister. One of the stones stones were slightly crooked with viable glue."
4.0,Ran a little bit large for a medium for me but overall good quality breathable shirts for the gym
4.0,Smaller than had hoped
4.0,Beautiful when polished. It is a great size and the dragonflies really stand out after polishing every month after daily wear. The background is dark like picture shows. Looks great with contrasting charms.
4.0,Wish they were all bright colors. I wanted them to be a bit wider. Great price for fun cheaters.
4.0,Works well & very adjustable. Doesn't stick out.<br />  The elastic isn't as strong as I was expecting. Time will tell if it holds up on my jeans. Fine for now.
4.0,5'6&#34; I like it but wish it was slightly longer I got a small.
4.0,"Broke after a few months, but I was very happy with it."
4.0,Very nice looking band. Excited to wear it.
4.0,Thick and comfortable. Nice to use it when shuffling snow outside. Wish they have more color collection.
4.0,"The size is perfect, holds all of my &#34;stuff&#34;, Love the color!<br />Would be better if it had more card slots and a place for my ID.<br />Has a terrible odor."
4.0,"It says on the product page to size down so I did by half a size, should’ve done a full size down.<br />They are pretty big on me, but it’s not a big deal since after using them for several days around the house I’ve gotten used to them.<br />I would recommend at least 1 size lower though in my case I could’ve done 1.5 sizes lower and it probably would’ve been perfect.<br /><br />Otherwise they really are comfy and the arch support is no joke, they are so much better to wear compared to ones that are flat with not much support."
4.0,"I got this for my son, amazing quality. Fit well, its loose not super fitted."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ea613e9555edffbd530441d2282853ca]] very itchy on the straps i have no curves so the bottom was kinda loose
4.0,"Very nice watch, however, hour and minute hands are hard to read at times because it blends in with the numeral markers. Also not luminescent."
4.0,"Great for sleeping when you just get your ears pierced, but I recomend the hoped ones because the studs are very tiny and can just about go right through. If you're allergic to metals then I highly recommend trying plastic like these"
4.0,I got a ectra large becase the reviews and o normally wear a xtra large i think a xtra large would have been fine
4.0,This is a cute and fun shirt to wear.  My only wish is that it were a little longer.
4.0,"This is a well-made vest, nicely padded - not too much and not too little - and lined with a satiny fabric for easy on and off. It has a perfectly-placed slash pocket on each side for warming the hands and maybe sticking the keys or other small items. Like many vests it can be a little snug, so in my case, I ordered an XL even though I wear Large in shirts and jackets.<br /><br />What I like most is that the arm openings are cut back enough on top that there is no shoulder ""overhang"" like many other vests, so I love the fit.<br /><br />What I DON'T like is that the zipper is BACKWARDS. Instead of stabbing the passive end with the left hand and zipping with the right, you have to insert the starter end in from the right and zip with the left hand. That always throws me, both when putting it on and taking it off, and it's a lot fussier than it should be.<br /><br />I also don't like the big white slogan on the front left. It's nice to urge people to ""Follow Your Dream"", but it seems out of place on a vest. It might as well say something else helpful like ""Don't Drink and Drive"" or ""Have a Nice Day"", neither of which I'd want either. Why not a logo image, or even the maker's name?<br /><br />That said, it's a nice garment, and even though I'll never get used to the backwards zipper, I'll get some good use out of it.<br /><br />But I'm still deducting a star for the things I don't like. Reverse the darn zipper!"
4.0,not proportioned but still looks good
4.0,"This skirt was great for the price. The fabric isn't super thick (and is a bit sheer around the legs) but that is to be expected for the price. I was able to wear undergarments without the print showing through so overall I would recommend if you're looking for a solid, affordable basic. I wear mine to work and it is very versatile."
4.0,"Really comfortable with great breathable material. If you wear this on your waist as apposed to your hips, which it seems designed for, you won't get the full 40&#34; length as advertised. I'm 6'1&#34; and the pants end about 3-4&#34; above my ancle so I wear them as shorts with the elastic around the base of my knee."
4.0,"Didn't notice anything ridiculously soft about the shirt. But it's cotton, feels good and fit's just right. Decent price also."
4.0,"Shorter than anticipated, but all in all a good dress."
4.0,I only give this 4 stars because the photo is deceiving. The back is much shorter than it originally looks. I am normally a size small but I bought a large and this fits perfectly and gives the look you want in this type of sweater.
4.0,"Solid fit on these compression tanks! They fit about right, but tend to have a shorter length to them. I like it, as I prefer my tanks to sit above my waist. If you prefer a longer tank, you'll want the next size up. For additional info, I am 5'11, 158lbs, and an athletic build with broad shoulders. My general shirt size (both fitted and regular) is Medium, and I ordered a medium in these tanks."
4.0,"fits great, no irritation, easy enough to adjust... its a bit noticeable when it needs to be cleaned though (which is not easy to do by hand)."
4.0,Gloves are comfortable but not as warm as I liked in our -15 degrees weather.
4.0,"Our daughter loved them as a present on her 7th birthday.  Now she can ""twin"" with me."
4.0,It’s a little longer than I thought it would be. I can’t get the wrinkles out. The tag doesn’t say if it can be ironed.
4.0,Good material and fit but the back pocket is too big for phone. Phone will be dangling while running.
4.0,"Pretty scarf, good deal for the price."
4.0,"My toddler has been wearing the set around the house since it came in the mail. It's cute. The mittens are pretty thin, but the hat looks like it'll keep her head warm in all but the coldest part of winter."
4.0,I like this bag because it's roomy and light weight.  It's soft and flexible.  The only draw back in my opinion is that it doesn't have an inside pocket for my phone.
4.0,"We ordered these for a Legends of the Hidden Temple Halloween costume and they look great. Very lightweight, color and finish are good quality. Seems like they only come in one size (sticker inside says large) so it looks big on my head but fits my husband well. I don’t recommend these at all for safety, they’re clearly just a costume accessory."
4.0,I like it but it doesn't fit as loosely as I would like. I purchased the 2x but it fits okay. I would like it a bit baggier.
4.0,This belt is easy and fun. I bought the black on black. My only complaint is that the black buckle easily chips. This allows the metal you shine through making it look old. Perhaps another color would hold up longer... I'm sure it would.
4.0,"Awesome belly ring! Bought twice, and looks just like the picture"
4.0,Does it’s purpose!
4.0,These are great.  I ordered blue and red bandanas.  And... they fit my large head great.  The only thing I wish is that they were printed on both sides - they're not - just on one side.
4.0,"Out of all the LA Caps I have ever had this one is the best made by far. I have lots of thick hair so the oversize bill is a good look for me. P.S. 4/4 Cherokee and I thought this was an Indian design. It is not, but still Kewl in concept and good looking cap."
4.0,"I bought it as a gift.  The product is fine, but the color didn't match anything in my friend's wardrobe.  There were few chocies so I'd recommend the manufacturers look at recent fashions and try to provide better color choices.  I won't return it because there was nothing wrong with it, but it's going into the Goodwill bin"
4.0,Just what I was looking for. Seems well made.
4.0,"The shirts fit great! They are a little shorter than I would like, but still a good product."
4.0,"The color almost blends too good to my skin. You almost can't tell I'm wearing this but I got it for self-love/care as rose quartz crystal is good for that so that doesn't bother me as much because I'm the one seeing this little beauty. Oddly enough, I had to put it in upsidedown, as the large bead screws into the pole."
4.0,Small blemish upon arrival. Looks okay although I really don't like the large buckle.
4.0,"My go to trend for spring/summer has been the kimono. It's versatile, light and stylish. I paired thee Orchid Row's Kimono with a pair of jean shorts and tank. A great look for a casual summer night. I'm 5'1&#34; and the shorter length was perfect. It hit me mid-thigh. I am loving kimonos and the versatility of the looks."
4.0,I bought these for my husband...our daughter owns a &#34;spin&#34; studio so we live everything with bikes...they are fun and fit well!
4.0,lace is adorable but beware the material is ribbed I however liked that it does run a bit small
4.0,"For my back I use it all the time so it traer so this is why I want to by it again, I purchase a different brand but is no the same it move a lot from my waist and it doesn’t work for my back."
4.0,"Love the look of the tank, but unfortunately it was way too big for me.  For reference, I'm 5'2, 100LBs and a 32B."
4.0,I love this shirt. Comfy and flattering and easy to wear.
4.0,Some are a little difficult to put together. Harder plastic than the originals.
4.0,"Great cover up.  Not expensive fabric, but it's light and comfortable."
4.0,"They are adorable and fit my 1 year old pretty good. I took off a star because one of the hats had a small hole in it, the other hats were in good condition. Fast delivery."
4.0,Cute little wallet
4.0,"The watch has lasted me over a year. It took a beating, not going to lie. It’s a easy to latch on band. I own a Garmin Instinct and it fit fine.<br /><br />The leather is soft, and durable but over time the black ink on the inner side of the band will leak to the surface part of the band. I don’t recall any issues with smell and I didn’t get irritation from the band either. The band keeper (the movable piece of leather thing that keeps the band) did eventually rip, but it’s back by plastic and wouldn’t have come off if my kids hadn’t picked at it. In fact besides the ink issue the stitching on the band is near perfect since I bought it and it hasn’t cracked once. Definitely recommended just beware of the ink coming through."
4.0,"Nice basic cheap dress. Fits true to size, I normally wear L in most clothes and same for this. I'm a 36DD and the deep V isn't too low to make it inappropriate. The fabric is a soft cotton but it's on the sheer side. Not sheer as in see through but not thick so I'm not sure as to how well it will hold up to many washes. But it's a simple and comfortable black dress. I'm happy with it and I'll be wearing it to work (not a conservative environment)"
4.0,"These bracelets are adorable and functional!  The size is perfect. I have a bit of an issue with the elastic not staying in place due to a shallow and slippery indentation in the middle. Other than that, I love them!"
4.0,awesome as a gift
4.0,"Stiff leather belts are a little harder to find these days.  So many are bonded leather and two glued layers.  This one isn't as it is one layer and has a lot of body (i.e. firmness).  Think of a gun holster belt type leather.  It looks very nice yet very simple which is what I think is a proper combination.  The buckle has a little pizazz yet remains understated in antiqued brass.  There is attention to detail  I'd say as the buckle end has some nice contrasting stitching that may well be hand stitched.  I'm hoping the buckle is solid brass instead of painted pot metal.  I really cannot be sure of this, yet it looks good enough to possibly be solid brass.  Overall this is an excellent belt for a modest price.  Even the delivery presentation is a bit more than expected as it comes in it's own pouch with draw-string closure.  It was suppose to be a 38"" belt and it is...plus an inch?  I'm glad it's not too short for sure, but I'd rather it be spot-on for my best fit.  I'm deducting one-star for this which is not a deal killer by any means I'd say."
4.0,"For a cheap watch (it is obviously cheap, the glass scratched easily, and the dark color wore off with time and contact on my skin), it is an excellent product.  It kept time quite well as long as I kept it wound (once every other day, as it winds down through the night) and is a beautiful piece.  Know that it is a cheap watch, but for the price, it is an excellent piece.<br /><br />The chain on the watch isn't one that department stores can resize for you (it doesn't have pins like you'd expect).  I had to take mine to a local watch smith to get it sized, but that only cost me $8, so I am quite pleased.<br /><br />I've since switched to a Pebble Steel smartwatch for business purposes, otherwise, I'd still be using this watch."
4.0,Easily snags but great fit and shows upper body muscle
4.0,"Loved the design for this gaiter and so did my son, but this gaiter is very short and tight on my 10 yr old but he’s going to make it work because he loves fortnite."
4.0,"So I got these a few days early then expected.. they all look like the pic even better..  Definitely a good buy.. the only thing is that they seem like 5/8 but feel slightly , very slighty longer. .But other than that they are really cute. Btw I'm wearing the light pink one it's my fav by far."
4.0,"Cute top! It fits loosely. It has a high neckline. And, it is very sheer, so you will need to layer it with another white tank top."
4.0,The fabric on this dress is thick enough not to be clingy buy thin enough to flow nicely.  Really comfortable.
4.0,"The pin was painted kind of wonky & the colors were a bit weird but still cute. Seller originally sent me the wrong pin but sent the correct one so fast, right in time for Christmas! Thanks!"
4.0,I'm curvy and the dress didn't fall right on me.
4.0,Adorable and perfect for the season. Received lots of compliments!
4.0,"The Laptop Protector holds everything I need for my Laptop - Battery, mouse, power cords, etc..  And I love the Color - LIME GREEN!!"
4.0,Waistband is a little snug but they are very flattering! I’m 5’10’ & 225lbs and carry most of my weight around my stomach. I would say true to size! I loved the detail!
4.0,"They're what you would expect. A little flimsy because they're ""ultra thin"". They also have some leftover silicone shavings on the inside from the mold they were made in. Nothing an exacto knife can't fix. But ultimately pretty satisfied."
4.0,"These are great sunglasses, but the blue isn't as good as the dark lense. Seems dark."
4.0,This dress is simple and extremely flattering. It fit as expected. I can't wait to wear it out this summer.
4.0,"Good price, easy to read.<br />Instructions are lousy and written in a tiny font."
4.0,"Really nice and comfortable, I plan to use it often for kayak and fishing. Only issue I have is that the sleeves are to long."
4.0,"I probably should have gotten a size smaller!  These look good, but seem to be cheaply made and the lenses slightly distort my sight."
4.0,It's really nice but a little snug
4.0,"This is a cute shirt.  But my sister rubbed her finger across it, to remove something I had spilled, and it got what I can only describe as a &#34;runner&#34; in it. Like pantyhose.  I can't even be mad at the shirt. Just don't &#34;rub&#34; it."
4.0,"This robe is a verry good for one size fits  all keeps you dry and good fabric and plus has a hood,I would by it again if I need another robe and of course this seller has great customer service, I like it because its a good solid robe"
4.0,"Nice Masculine piece, It looks beautiful on his wrist, Thank You! Brenda M."
4.0,"Bought this for my father in law who suffers from macular degeneration. He is overall happy with the watch but complained about the watch band.  He always wore a Timex stretchable band which was better quality. That was his major complaint, his minor complaint was the guys voice telling the time.  &#34;They found some old man like myself sitting around doing nothing and gave him the job of telling the time&#34;  But overall he seems satisfied."
4.0,"I love this mask! I can take a breath and not suck in the mask! It’s well made and comfortable. The issue is that it runs super small! I ordered a medium because I have an average head size for a woman. It looks like a children’s mask. It works, but not when I drop my jaw to sing. Will reorder and get a large."
4.0,My 5 year old loves these shoes my only issue is the shoe laces. They are cheap. Shoe overall is good quality.
4.0,"I didn't realize it's really thick when I bought it. However, it's metal and seems to be of good quality. It came in it's own box which made it easy to wrap."
4.0,Really cute bag. It was a little smaller than I expected but it's so cute.
4.0,I like the tinted lenses for use on the computer monitor.  The magnification is not as sharp on as my other clear readers.  They both are 2.50.  The fit is good and the spring hinge is nice too.
4.0,It is not very sturdy. It could bend and loos it’s shape. Hopefully is will not damage the glasses. Good it wan’s expensive.
4.0,"Very nice, but wish it was a little bigger neck size"
4.0,These are well made socks. They have a great look to them and my grandson loves these socks. I gave it 4 stars and would’ve given it 5 had it not been so costly. One pair of boys socks should not cost $25. We can’t afford these socks for every day of the week ( wish we could ).
4.0,"This dress is seriously so cute! It looks exactly like it does in the pictures. My only problem is that it's a little too short in the back, I'm barely 5 feet tall but very curvy from behind and would prefer just a little more fabric back there, but for a dress this cute and for such a low price, I just won't bend over all night!"
4.0,Love it!!! Perfect size and shape.
4.0,"The iron rings are just what they say, iron rings! Perfect to balance Saturn. I was expecting 1, I got 4!"
4.0,"Nice wallet but too thick for what he wanted, returned. Beautiful leather and nice quality but just not what he likes."
4.0,"Its a premium looking polarized sunglass which is very light in weight. It has a same size as advertised. It also include decent case. Good thing is, it is unisex so I can share it with my wife. Good item for the price."
4.0,Barely glows
4.0,The quality of the fabric and print on these are great! Was a little worried because of the price but I am very happy. They are also actually comfortable! I ordered an extra large like I usually do with most thing but definitely could have gone down a size.
4.0,They are a nice product for the money.
4.0,"Le doy solo 4 estrellas porque no debería ser hueco en la paste posterior. Es muy bonito, espero sea de gran calidad para comprar más en 2023"
4.0,"El articulo que pedí era de un diseño diferente, pero me enviaron un diseño similar que pues me agrado, creo que me conformo porque veo que es un producto de calidad"
4.0,Great little suit. Good value for the price paid. The shirt was a bit cheap looking but all the other pieces were well-made.
4.0,I like these. The feel good as well. Ive had one set at least 2 years and they are still intact. Good doo rags.
4.0,"Great glasses, beautiful design but is little heavy weight."
4.0,"This shirt is like a cotton polyester type blend,  it says 100% cotton but the look and feel of it doesn't feel like it's cotton. The onesie fit great I ordered the 12 month and it fit great. The men's t shirt runs a bit small so if your a little bit of a bigger dude you might want to consider going up a size or pick a different shirt these are kinda a slim fit shirt."
4.0,"I like it but, its a little tight"
4.0,I think this shirt might be too short for women with longer or even regular length torsos.  It's perfect for me. My ribs are basically right on top of my hips 🤣 it washes well and the printing is of good quality. Also SUPER SOFT if you have sensory issues it's a great shirt. I only gave 4 stars because I believe for taller women it would not be a good fit.
4.0,I've been wearing this watch band for weeks now and it's been getting itchier and itchier. last night I noticed a distinct rash is developing under the watch band. I don't know if it is a me thing or if it's something the leather was treated with. My fabric Apple watch never did this to me. I did find a hypoallergenic tape meant for the inside of leather watchbands on Amazon. I really hope this fixes the problem because other than this I absolutely LOVE the watch band... though it could be a bit longer (it barely fits around my large wrist). Go Browns!
4.0,"Purchased for my husbands birthday.  He said they were very nice, sound canceling was good."
4.0,"This handbag was a gift and a wonderful one at that! Very very pleased with the color, quality and shipment time!"
4.0,Somewhat fit small
4.0,"Size 8 weight 5.1 oz as a pair. Comfortable but minimal arch support. Keeping these for camp shoes or shower sandals, but will not be walking any distance in these."
4.0,"This seems to be well made, warm and is cute.  Typically I wear a medium to large in tops (depending on stretch and bust) and small to medium in pants (only wear ones with elastic waist) but ordered an xl because I was going to give it to my daughter as a gift, it would not have fit so I kept it (this 4 stars instead of 5)  I like the way it fits as I like sleeping in loose things so I would size up especially if you like nightgowns looser.  FYI measurements are approximately 40/33/37 and I am  5’2” and as you can see it comes almost to my ankles.  I thought it was 100% cotton which I always prefer but it is 65% poly/35% cotton knit blend so I will see if it sleeps hot tonight.  Typically I have issues with sleeping in synthetic fabrics but I hoping since this feels more cotton, it won’t be too bad.<br />Update: I wore it to bed last night and slept well.  It is warm but breathed so it wasn’t too hot. Really feels more like cotton."
4.0,My nine year old daughter got these for her birthday.  They are cute and a value for the price.  The colors are very pretty.
4.0,"We have hardwood floors and tile throughout our entire house and I have feet that are always cold. Normally I’d just throw on socks and do my best not to slip and land on my face. Recently though I had a baby and didn’t feel comfortable taking that risk while holding him so I’ve been getting a few pairs of socks with grips and these have been a great addition.<br />While I’m not too sure what to say about the design they picked for the top of the sock, maybe my mind is just forever childish. I can’t help but wonder why none of the design team thought “maybe we should consider other options”<br />Function wise they’re great though, they hug your foot exactly how you hope your new socks will. The sizing is perfect, they stay on my feet great and I haven’t had any issues with them sliding down. Most importantly, my feet have stayed warm but I haven’t come close to slipping even once since wearing them.<br /><br />I haven’t had them long enough to say how they’ll hold up but I can update this in a few months. I hope this review was helpful!"
4.0,"Has a wacky feel but looks great, definitely buy"
4.0,"I wear these under pants made of thin fabric, they work well for my purposes without causing me to overheat (they aren't lined)."
4.0,Great pants for the price.  I recommend.
4.0,Buy a size up. Arrived sooner than expected date just in time for Christmas. My nephew loved it!
4.0,Fly Shirt ....Just a little bit too small
4.0,Quality  of product
4.0,Great look n light
4.0,Product as described online
4.0,"This is absolutely beautiful! The color is so vibrant. Yes, the fabric is very sheer but there is aligning underneath. I think it's perfect for it summer weather. I had to take off a star because I'm the first day we used it the button in the back fell off. That was not so non very well but other than that my daughter and I love it."
4.0,Good length. Haven't worn it yet as it's too cold still.
4.0,I use them for work !!
4.0,"Not a very popular brand but a very comfortable short. I also have it in Red, Black and Grey. Really recommended."
4.0,"Too small; sending it to a friend, but I love the play on the Hard Rock Cafe theme, so I'm getting the larger size"
4.0,My 8 year old daughter just loved this set! The gems look sparkly and she enjoys wearing them. I would recommend this product.
4.0,"My daughter loves this bra, but a warning that it is oversized. I had to exchange for a smaller size, even after I did her measurements before I ordered."
4.0,"First time I ever had to squeeze myself into a pair of shorts. Sadly, read they fit small so ordered a size up- which, didn’t do much for me. Their sizes are off, at not within standard industry sizing"
4.0,It looks exactly like the picture except that in my case it was beyond floor length. If I fold the top then it becomes floor length. I'm 5'4 and purchased the XL should have bought a size smaller.
4.0,"Fits good though I have a very small bust and the cups are a little large, but my mid section makes up for the rest."
4.0,"Overall, this is a great dress! I am 5'10 and worry about the length of dresses. This was plenty long enough, hit below the knee. The scallop detail is flattering, but I will say the back scallop where the zipper pulls the fabric together does pull away a bit. No complaints...fits true to size. I got a large and I had plenty of room in it."
4.0,Large fit my junior sized 9/11 girl perfectly except they are too long. Not a big deal since they are just lounge pants but I wish we got to keep the cute smiley face. These are thin enough to see colored panties but fine if you are wearing white.
4.0,Cute bathing suit cover.
4.0,Really cute and very comfortable but they do look a little more “mom bra” in person. I know that’s what they are for but just not quite what I expected. Nevertheless a great bra that fits well!
4.0,Does a good job.  For some reason the darker ones are tighter than the white ones.
4.0,"I got these to have something comfy to wear while I'm working from home that I could possible transition into office wear. These are definitely more on the relaxed/comfy side, but could probably work with the right shirt/shoes pairing. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something just for business-casual wear, but would definitely recommend if you're looking for something comfortable that isn't sweat pants or pajamas."
4.0,It is great. I spend a lot of hours in the sun and helps a lot. It would he 5 Star if it would have an mouth opening/filter so I can speak and be understood without removing it from face.
4.0,Love the ability to just have important stuff with me. The cross body strap could be 3-4 more inches longer.
4.0,Bought for my son. Fit good and he says they are comfy but they got snagged right away... 😐
4.0,"It only got a four star because we ordered a purple skirt but got a maroon/pink color. The color is pretty but we expected purple. My daughter likes the color so we have kept it. She is 10 years old (usually wears a 10-12 in girls clothing and it fits her quite well. A tad big on her, but it is a women's one size fits most.  based on the reviews I had read I expected it to fit or be slightly big on her and it is. She loves it!!! I have included a picture so you can see the color."
4.0,"Bought for my daughter, she likes them.  Stylish, and polarized.  Nice combination."
4.0,A little bigger than expected but still love the looseness and comfort for everyday wear.
4.0,"As long as you don't plan to use it to keep warm, it's a nice costume piece.  Good for what it is."
4.0,"Ordered as a gift, nice earrings, good value"
4.0,"Love the color but a little big, could’ve gone down a size."
4.0,It was on time and looks awesome unfortunately I don't think it looks good on me
4.0,"I first bought one in blue and was surprised by the Apple logo but really loved the case. It was just like the ones I've gotten from Apple (if you treat it moderately well). The blue was a really great color so I got the purple.<br /><br />The purple is still a decent case but the color is not very strong. In most lighting it looks beige and only occasionally does it look lavender. Oh well, it was $7 and I still like it just. I just really wanted to mention that in case in a comment having a purple case would've been a selling point. Overall, these are great minimum protection, fashionable cases!"
4.0,",short on arrival, adapted to my feet and became #1 house shoe."
4.0,Looks exactly as pictured. I am 5'8&#34; and 140lbs. I wear a 34C and I ordered a large. I normally wear a medium so I would recommend one size bigger for this item.
4.0,Nice. Didn’t realize in the picture that it has a distressed look to it meaning the edges look like the color is coming off. Still nice so I’ll keep
4.0,"It fits beautifully. My only complaint is because I'm top heavy the buttons do pop open. Otherwise I ordered the next size up as I'm a solid DD, 5'7&#34; and a size 14. I've already received compliments just from posting on social media."
4.0,"This is cute but I wasn't expecting the top back to be sheer.  I usually wear size M most of the time, but I bought this in a Large based off seller size chart.  I am so glad I did!  It is a little difficult to put on because the fabric has no stretch to it.  After you step into the shorts, it helps to lean forward while putting on the sleeves.  Also the buttons are a little difficult because they thread through a VERY small elastic loop.  That being said, this closure caused a tiny bit of gaping, but not so bad."
4.0,"Fits as expected.  A little rough feeling out of the package, but I'm sure it will help once I wash them."
4.0,This dress is pretty much exactly what I expected except the straps are a touch wider than I thought - I would say about 2 fingers wide
4.0,"so far so good....i have only worn it 3 times but, knock on wood it is still working<br />it looks pretty much the the picture"
4.0,I ended up wearing this as a swimsuit cover up because the front is a crossover thing and when I walked it &#34;split&#34; all the way to my swimsuit bottoms. Lots of compliments as a cover up though.
4.0,El tono del metal que encaja en el apple es un poco más obscuro que el original. Es algo ligero el material. Pero se ve bonito.
4.0,order  two sizes  larger than you normaly fit wife better at largre
4.0,Gorgeous! just be ware that they are large and a bit on the heavy side!
4.0,"this is such a unique and beautiful ring. just the right amount of thickness. great silver, no smell, no stains. i haven't taken it off since i purchased it on 1/21/21. 4 stars because the rose color is fading but i still love it. NO REGRETS."
4.0,"I ordered this WELAKEN girls Jacket for our little daughter and she says she likes the Leopard pattern colors, the design and the styling of the zipper closure, the front pockets with zippers, the elastic hem and cuffs, and the hoodie. We do like that this jacket fits her pretty well and she says that it is comfortable to wear, easy to put on and take off as needed and she likes the texture of the inner fabric lining and she says that it is soft, smooth to touch and gentle on her skin. My wife likes that we got this jacket in the nick of time as the windy season has started in our neck of the woods with the occasional rain. We do like that the jacket is windproof and covers her from being wet with the occasional wetness.<br />We do like that this jacket seems to be made with good quality materials, and it appears to be good value for money, considering the quality and the price point. I would recommend it."
4.0,These are warm enough and seem sturdy. They are rather large. I could probably wear them hacked  into two pieces at the ear.
4.0,"I lucked out with this and another Bargin Finds jewelry order I made. This one (and that one) was estimated to take 3 to 6 weeks to arrive and came in just under 2! I just received it, so cannot speak to its durability, but at this price, if it lasts even a few uses, it is worth it. At first site, it looks beautiful- even better than it did in the 1st/primary picture shown here."
4.0,Came set to the correct local time (EDT). Took a little playing around to see the “button” to snap open the cover.
4.0,The only thing I did not like was the way it fit on neck part it was a little bulky it didn't lay flat.
4.0,Wish it was tagless though
4.0,Light-weight comfortable material. Length is great.
4.0,Nice bag – good leather - wrong hardware color.  shows gold hardware actual item has pewter colored hardware
4.0,"This button down hoodie was  thin and soft and comfortable to wear.  Its great to lounge around in on a weekend or when you just want to relax and not get too dressed up, though I would not rely on it to keep you warm in the winter unless it was layered with other clothes beneath it."
4.0,I would've given 5 stars but I didn't because it's not the same color as in the picture. It's more of a dark teal in person. I usually wear a large but I ordered an XL which was suggested by a review I read. I'd like to see what a large looks like so I'll be ordering another one in a different color. Overall I really like the style. I didn't realize the sleeves are actually long but that's great. I'm 5'4 and 163lbs.
4.0,works really good for cooler water temps; swam and moved in it easily
4.0,Outdoor yard work
4.0,"Perfect cute sports bra. It's definitely not something I'd wear to hard core workouts but looks good, especially if you carry a bit of fat under your breasts on the top part of the ribs. It covers beautifully and looks great with high wasted pants! Definitely a go-to for my shape and size."
4.0,"this top is very cute, but I did have to take it in some to get it to fit properly."
4.0,"High quality leather.  Nice bag, and have had a lot of people asking where I got the bag, because they want one too."
4.0,"The shirts is fine. I will say that i imagined the material being different per the photo, and maybe that is my fault for not reading the description but its just a regular cotton tshirt. Not a stretch or silk-ish material like how its portrayed in the photo. Its just a regular cotton shirt. Cute still! but i had a different kind of shirt in my mind."
4.0,Overall pretty pleased.  A lot heavier than I thought it would be and feels pretty durable.  Holds up in cold temps too.
4.0,"This is a nice product, but I am not convinced that I &#34;love it&#34; yet. It makes me look pregnant or that I am trying to hide my belly. Of course, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just get self-conscious with no &#34;form&#34; to the bottom of a shirt. I needed this for a trip I am taking and it seems like it would dry easily, so I will take it with me. But I plan on sewing the neckline in a bit, it's too open for my taste, so I will sew the bottom of the V together about an inch or more, as there are no buttons. The material is not thin, seems like good quality."
4.0,"Fits pretty good other than the sleeves a little short, I would recommend getting a size bigger than what you would normally wear"
4.0,"I ordered it as a gift for Christmas and when we tried to link to the Disney account it is just giving us errors. We have tried multiple phones to connect the band but it is just giving an error of ""ID invalid"" and will not connect.<br />You will have to use a computer and the ID code on the back to link to your Disney account since there are newer versions being released by Disney."
4.0,Nice little case.  Wayyyy to small for big sunglasses.  Would definitely hold a regular pair of eyeglass though.
4.0,"The glasses are lightweight, comfortable and screen the sun well."
4.0,Came quickly. Looks nice.
4.0,Beautiful just keep and eye on it because it might separate and fall off.
4.0,Looks good.  There isn’t a latch just springs so it does tend to pop off easily so I only gave 4 stars.  But overall happy
4.0,"Fit is good. Soft, comfortable, no riding up. They wash well. Fine in dryer.<br />No cotton crotch, tho. 48% kaylon (what ever that is), 8% spandex and 44% polyester,"
4.0,It was a gift but the recipient seemed to like it.
4.0,Bought for daughter
4.0,"This sports bra is very comfortable. It has a v neck front and it is wireless. It is a pullover, no clips or zippers. It has removable pads. It also has criss cross strapping in the back. It is polyester and spandex so it is machine washable."
4.0,Mask works great and fits well! It had a foam cushion but the glue stopped working. Still works fine without it.
4.0,Love the size. There is 1 crystal missing but not really noticeable.  I plan on using it on my rearview mirror.
4.0,"I would give 5 stars because I love the sentiment. However, this chain is NOT 18 inch. I have it in the last hole, with a 2-inch extender, and it's still very short!"
4.0,These are cute - but they're typical stickers and don't stay on very well. Fun for play or a party. If your child has expectations of wearing them all day this won't work.
4.0,Abit too big
4.0,I like it not as flowy as pictured
4.0,The only thing I don't like about this cutie pie pug is it doesn't hold sunglasses. Other then that very happy with it.
4.0,This is made really well. The green beads are still shiny and have not fallen out of it macrame weave. I like it!
4.0,"These jammies are awesome.  I ordered a M, (I'm 140lbs, 5'5"") but the top was snug so I returned and ordered a Large.  I like my jams roomy and I have boobs and the L worked.  The material is so soft and so comfy.  I have not washed them yet and I hope they don't shrink because I think they are my new favorites."
4.0,"Good work boot, wore out my first pair."
4.0,Nice.  Stays on the watch.
4.0,For the price its awesome. I guess necklaces just aren't my thing. I wore it once but didn't really enjoy wearing it so I never wore it again. I don't have anything bad to say about it though. Its just whatever in my opinion. I bought 3 other necklaces after this one and didn't really like them either so I guess I am just not a necklace guy.
4.0,I liked them but they did not run in half sizes I ordered too small but sent them back for next size up
4.0,"The set was pretty okay except for the material between the gray and the block one is kinda different. The gray ones are completely good, but the black ones are kinda thinner and could see through which was ....kinda weird for me, so generally this set is a pretty good and comfortable set of items."
4.0,I previously had the same t-shirt in a size large which fit perfectly.  They seem to be running a bit larger now.
4.0,"Good quality, however not true to size. I ordered a 2X because I like my shirt to be a bit loose. This fit me as a large - or perhaps small XL - would have. The image on the material is crisp and the material is very soft. It will be OK if I air dry. Also...they sent me two. Lol."
4.0,It isn't cute on me because my boobs are too big but nevertheless it's a very cute jumper! Does run super small.
4.0,"The sizes run small so I ordered a size larger than what I normally get. It's very comfortable to wear, and it does make you sweat. The velcro on it has an awesome hold. I love it!"
4.0,Oh I Like that gold Casio digital watch plus the silver one.
4.0,"Beautiful color & soft fabric, but will have to return because the 12/14 fits more like an 11."
4.0,The size was smaller than I expected but the look is great.
4.0,These socks are so fun. It's fun too get asked what's on my socks and then put my feet together. People think it is so funny and completely random to have a llama on my socks! They are very comfortable and fit well
4.0,We had a hard time finding a last minute fresh flower Boutonniere in our neighborhood. So glad we ordered this as a back up. It worked out well.
4.0,Read the size chart for the correct size. Women’s sizes are numbered (36= xs). Men’s are letter sizes. I bought the 36 and the waist is snug but not uncomfortable. Otherwise they are fairly large (I had to roll the waist) and long but they do the job. Just walked the dog in 36 degree rain and was nice and dry.
4.0,"Super cute and great for, but can easily see underwear through it..so stick with grey or tan"
4.0,"Very pretty.  Heavy.  Bigger than I thought they would be, so they sort of &#34;hang&#34; in my earlobe.  The clasp doesn't close with a snap, so I will probably be checking on them constantly.  Otherwise, very nice."
4.0,"Good, comfortable shorts for the money, and a nice length."
4.0,Decent quality and fast shipping however the top fits a little loose and the boobs can come out
4.0,Very good for my usage
4.0,I got a great deal for this hat and a different color cost twice as much. The interior material is warm enough for the coldest days. But it is a little too tight for me. Hope there could be size choices in the future.
4.0,"Go up a size if you have hips and a butt. I'm a 34D, 5'5 and 155lbs and I got a large the fit was perfect."
4.0,"Order a size or so larger than you think you need, this runs a little small."
4.0,"It looks more fitted and like a t shirt than I expected, but it works well for running around for errands."
4.0,"This dress is a gorgeous shade of green, it’s very light weight. I love the slit in the side and the way it u-shapes down. I got a medium, but I’m probably more of a small kind of gal, but I’m glad I got the medium because I was able to cinch it and tie it a bunch of different ways. However, it was a little frumpy on me when I didn’t have it cinched. Looked not great (see first pic). But that might just be because of the wrong size.<br /><br />My only 2 things I didn’t love about this dress was 1) the holes in the top, which is my personal preference, I’m sure some people love it,  it’s just not for me. (But I won’t rate it less for that! That’s just my preference!) and 2)the pockets, which is why this dress got 4 stars for me instead of 5. Now, listen, I’m the kind of lady who LOVES dresses with pockets, and I think all dresses should have them. You wanna picket something, picket that! Equality for all dresses! Anyways, this dress, the pockets just didn’t work out for me. Because this dress is a little bigger than what I should’ve ordered, I cinched it which was great, looked amazing, BUT when I cinched it/knotted it, it would force the pockets to poke out on the side and I hated that. There’s just so much material for each pocket that it just didn’t work out so well for me. I might sew up the pockets and maybe I’ll love it more."
4.0,"This is such a pretty color, the wine color is as pictured! No complaints about the fit, I received so many compliments and looks! The only thing is that it doesn’t have tags so you have to test what is supposed to be the back or front of each piece. I’m 5’4, 32B, 118lbs, athletic build, purchased a small. I plan to purchase another color!!!"
4.0,Very cute and true to size. My only issue is the strap ripped at the desk after only one wash.
4.0,"Nice style, comfortable fabric, through it stretches out after a few wears."
4.0,The product arrived quickly and it is of good quality and fit. The pants are versatile wear and nice on a hot day.
4.0,This is a lovely looking bracelet. My one issue is that the clasp doesn't always align correctly when you try to close it (though it's perfectly fine once you position it yourself). I don't mind because I think it's very pretty. So if you think the look outweighs the annoyance of a finicky clasp (which I do) then this is a great purchase!
4.0,"Super cute. The material is kind of cheap but it’s still cute. 5’2 120 pounds, size small fits good."
4.0,"This shirt is very cute  and seems to be good quality, however, the material has very little stretch so if you want a loose fit order one size up."
4.0,"So I ordered his shirt in black and the lavender color, in the black I got a 2x which is my normal size, and I'm the lavender I got a 3x, just because I wanted to see which size fit better. Well the 2x felt better than the 3x. The 3x seemed to be more fitted. Each of tiers have elastic and the 3x just felt tighter for some reason. The only noticeable difference I saw with the sizes when I laid them on top of each other was that the 3x was about an inch long. I'll be sending the lavender one back but I love the black one!"
4.0,"Beautiful earrings for any occasion, and a great way to be a stealth geek in mixed company!  ;-)  I would have given them five stars, except for the fact that whatever metal is used tends to irritate my skin after two consecutive days of wearing them.  (Might change the hooks out for stainless steel one of these days.)  Otherwise, a fun purchase."
4.0,Only complaint I have is they run a little small.
4.0,"Ordered an XL based on the sizing chart and seller recommendation.  I am 6' tall with a 36"" waist.  These were HUGE.  Little more than oversized bike shorts.  Should have just ordered a medium like I wear in everything else.  Overall they seem decent, but only put on one pair to try them and immediately returned them.  Return process was quick and painless, hence the 4 stars, but sizing information is way off."
4.0,"Fits good, and cute but pants are a spandex material."
4.0,"This review for the BUREI Women's 13002-LH watch will be divided into different categories: appearance, comfort, and improvement.<br /><br />In terms of presentation, this watch blew this category out of the park. This watch comes with a beautiful box and bag with an envelope that holds an instruction's manual and a little info sheet from the makers. Inside the box holds the watch that is wrapped around a small pillow. I can definitely say I was &#34;wowed&#34; when I first opened the box. I would rate the presentation a 4/5.<br /><br />In terms of appearance, the watch was wonderfully put together. The straps have a simple nylon strap with blue and red racing stripes with many holes to fit any person's wrist. However, I'm not too crazy about nylon since it can cause chaffing if you sweat, but I'll let it slide on this watch. For the face of the watch, every quarter of the hour has sapphire crystal lens that makes this watch shimmer. The hands of the watch is also very well done. There is also a small window on the face of the watch for the day of the week. A very simple, but beautiful design. I would rate it a 5/5.<br /><br />In terms of comfort, this watch has some weight to it. I will have to let it slide though, since the face of the watch is pretty big. Again on the nylon, I'm not too crazy about the chosen material for the straps, since nylon is something that isn't recommended for hotter weather, which may cause chafing. I would rate comfort 3/5.<br /><br />In terms of improvement, I would recommend a different type of material for the straps. I'm a person who is very prone to chafing, so hopefully that won't happen with this watch.<br /><br />Pro tip: Make sure you stop the watch by pulling the knob out to retain the battery life. The last thing you would want is replacing a brand new watch's battery.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate this watch a 4 out of 5. This watch definitely screams beautiful and simple for people who are young and are into simplistic but elegant designs."
4.0,Very cute outfit! Looked like the photo. The buttons are cheaply made though so wont last long. But for a photoshoot it's perfect
4.0,"The finished edge on the sipper is a bit snug, no stretch to it.  I have been waring them for about a week and I'm still hoping they will stretch a bit more.  They are nice and warm inside and pretty too."
4.0,"Belt is well built and seems solid - somewhat of a strong process odor at first - but is most likely corrected grain or split leather, also known as genuine leather.  This is the skin layers that remain after the top is split off and from the corium (top and full grain) predominantly.  Split leather tends to be tougher in texture due to the fact that is resides under the top layers and is mostly used in applications that don’t require the leather to be soft like furniture backs and sides.  Like top grain leather genuine is also sanded to remove natural imperfections. Usually, the surface is spray painted.  This belt is not embossed with a leather-like pattern to resemble natural appearance. Overall it is what it says it is and nothing more or less.<br /><br />*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!<br />**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Great tank tops for the price, very soft and comfortable but they do tend to run a little big."
4.0,I do like this belt.  It is stretchy and looks good on.
4.0,"Not durable enough for a husband who is very active.<br />Cute idea, I really like them, maybe a little thicker to make it more durable for a larger wrist. I think it would be great for someone not as active , and for someone who doesn't have a physical job.<br />Doing better on my smaller wrist."
4.0,Nice watch. Exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,The color was exactly the color the way it looked in the advertisement they fit fine so I am enjoying them thank you
4.0,Fits well. good for covering up bulges. Attractive on larger figures.
4.0,They are fine for the price although I do find them a little sharp on the ends.
4.0,VERY roomy in the seat and legs.  My wife says it's too roomy.  I like the comfort.
4.0,"I personally was not a fan of these gloves. They are warm, pretty, and well constructed.  Overall they are great gloves and look very sophisticated without sacrificing warmth or comfort. I like the fleece lining and the slight stretch is good.<br /><br />However I don't think that they would be good with people who have larger hands as they are not stretchy and don't really have much give. The only thing wrong is the touch screen pads. I'm not sure if it was a defect in my particular gloves but the touch pads on the left hand don't work, the right ones are fine but this is problematic because I am left handed. Other then that these are great gloves and I think if they fit your mobility needs and the pads work you would really enjoy them. I recieved a discount on these for my honest opinion and that is what I have provided."
4.0,Granddaughter liked them
4.0,Fits great but kind of thin
4.0,Very Bright Blue!
4.0,It's pretty. And my granddaughter likes it.
4.0,It is smaller than I initially expected but I love petite necklaces so it was no problem for me. The engraved initial doesn’t pop excruciatingly so it doesn’t look tacky or overdone. Pretty cute.
4.0,"Nice casual swing fit, love it."
4.0,I like these socks but didn’t feel like they really were compression socks. I got the neon pink ones and they truly are neon pink ha overall I’d buy again but not if I was truly looking for compression socks.
4.0,Comfy and I love the color!
4.0,All 3 my kids LOVE this hoodie. But even though it is fleece it is very thin. I didn't even try to wash it yet. so I update late if there is a problem with that.  The DESIGN is VERY COOL.
4.0,I would give it 5 stars but it says large and It's not large. I would call it medium.
4.0,"White logo you see here won't be white unless you slide a white paper inside, together with your key card. The slit that holds the key ring looks easy to rip, otherwise it looks great. Non slippery card holder."
4.0,I do really like the look and feel of this dress. I probably will wear this as a cardigan sometimes too.
4.0,The fabric is a nice material & looks dressy enough for work. My only complaint is the material has no give so even though it fits when I have to stretch my arms it pinches in my shoulders.
4.0,"These are gorgeous boots! They fit tight around your feet though, so my toes feel very claustrophobic. They are also tight around the calf area (mine are almost 14 inches), I can just get them zipped. I have only wore them with a dress, so I don't know how they will work with jeans. I usually don't wear this high of a heel, but it doesn't bother me. I would not wear these if you have to walk around too much - my feet hurt after a short time of wearing them, which is a bummer. Not the most comfortable; however, they are pretty and stylish."
4.0,"Genuine Hav-A-Hank. Nice thickness of fabric, pattern centered on square. Washed in cold water and tumble dried on low. Colors didn’t fade or run and depth of color is the same on front and back. Not as soft as they were 20 years ago, but will soften up over time."
4.0,This is a perfect lightweight wrap. Love pockets!
4.0,Looks as shown. Fits small.
4.0,"I really like these sleeveless cardigans, I already have 3 in other colors. I am returning the red because it is not what I consider a true red (more of an orange undertone). I bought it to go with a 4th of July outfit and the reds clashed (I know red is a risky color to order online). I'll include a picture with the item against a true red t-shirt (you can see my 4th of July bandana wreath with it as well to give some idea of the color difference)."
4.0,"Cards are a bit difficult to remove. But, they also won't fall out either. Looks good, works good."
4.0,I bought these for my husband but he hasn't worn them yet. They are very nice and look exactly like the picture.
4.0,"I like the skirt, and style but the top button failed in the first week."
4.0,cute shirt. great for summer time.
4.0,These took a long time to get to me but it was worth it. They are beautiful!
4.0,The length is too long.
4.0,Awesome boots! May want to waterproof spray before wearing.
4.0,"Fit well, true to size. Looks cute with boots! Great for fall"
4.0,I really liked this coat. I got a lot of compliments on it. Looks very flattering and cute.
4.0,It was ok. I suspect that all my issues with them have to deal with size. Amazon printed me to buy in saying these would fit my big feet but they are just small enough to make them difficult to wear and to keep my toes in. They are comfortable enough and would be an easy 5 stars of my feet were smaller!
4.0,"Great skating dress at incredible reasonable price. The material, fit and quality are great.<br /><br />The only down side is that the net goes a little too low near the right armpit. My daughter was uncomfortable...plus we wanted to jazz it up a little so we added a nice rhinestone border along the seam, covering up about an inch."
4.0,Very sheer but nice for house or beach
4.0,"I got this for my 13 year old who is always looking for a bag to bring Pokémon cards or Nintendo controllers or d&d dice or bey blades or his iPad mini / iPhone with him over a friends house. He would normally ise a Starbucks bag but those were too small and didn't last long, or a reusable grocery store bag but those always collapsed.<br /><br />Its actually got a great zipper, stands on its own, and is pretty light weight and durable. It's near perfect. The only reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 is because of these 2 reasons:<br /><br />First reason is It is alittle on the small side. It is still larger than a Starbucks bag so it does work for our purpose, but i would have preferred alittle bit bigger. Just like an extra 2-3 inches. Ot just took me by surprise. it is probably perfect for a younger child. It is smaller than a reusable grocery store bag.<br /><br />Second reason because of the brand tag that is not removable. It says ""Infant"" and he is a teen, and so it is probably for a younger kid but still I would have liked to be able to get this and not have the tag on it so his friends don't see. I told him he doesn't have to use it but he still does. All in all I would buy again based on the quality, just keep in mind the size and tag which aren't a really bog deal."
4.0,"I like that hat, looks cute on! It looks bit big overall as I'm small (5,1&#34;). I was afraid it would be too loose but you can adjust the circumference on the inside by tying it tighter. The seam on the inside where the size adjustment is came apart but it on the inside and can easily be fixed by seeing a couple of stitches."
4.0,I was wonder why necklace  stone is difrent color than th earing and bracelet
4.0,I like the purse. Quality not that great but for the price you can't beat it.
4.0,The metal pins that come with it do not work with Pebble Metal as it states. I just reused the ones I had.
4.0,"Hat is basically great.  Have worn it each morning to walk in the very cold weather and my head is toasty. This stays out as opposed to other hats that ride up and suddenly are not covering your ears.  Not so with this hat.  I would’ve given the hat a 5, but one of the cute fuzzy pom pons fell off after about a week of wearing."
4.0,"This is a very pretty dress and sits well on the body. It’s not body fitting and hides my tummy well. However, the bottom embroidery on the dress is prickly. I would wear the dress again but I can’t wear it all day. It’s defintely irritating. But hey...I got a lot of compliments to the dress."
4.0,"Fit as expected from the size chart. A little more modest coverage than expected with a 34C bust, but still lovely!"
4.0,Love these. Love the no seem at the crotch so it doesn't show unflattering. They are great. Fit great. Soft and love them.
4.0,"Cleaned boats very well, but I feel like degraded them as well"
4.0,So fun and fit nice
4.0,"Nice wallet! Textures are really nice. I guess the test of time,, wear, and tear will tell the story"
4.0,Smaller than I thought it’d be. I’m a large and it fits like a medium.
4.0,"A well designed, and appears to be well made, product that really helps get rid of clutter inside the briefcase/bag. Amazing how much space it saves, particularly if you have a messenger bag that does not have many pockets. As someone with a lot of cords, it comes close to perfect."
4.0,Nice shirt. Thick material
4.0,"bunches around the cut outs, and collects static..  but, love them still.."
4.0,Just a little big and waste strap I’d be careful with washing and it coming out a bit mangled
4.0,Nice enough tie. Lost a star because the strap on the back to hold the smaller end in place tore off during the first use.
4.0,I love these gloves!  I use them in my daycare for diaper change and they work great!  Quality could improve a bit but overall they work great for what I need them for!
4.0,"It’s good quality, soft and nice colors.  I found the arms to be huge and baggy.  The arms were so long that cuffing them didn’t help.  It fit me perfectly elsewhere.  I’m 5’4” and 145 pounds and got a large.  The material was heavier than described."
4.0,"Really nice quality, it shipped fast, but its really difficult to put on. But i highly reecomed it."
4.0,"This hat doesn't really look that good in the picture, but in person it's stunning.<br />My daughter loves it, and she looks really pretty and sophisticated in it.<br />The contrasting colors work surprisingly well, and the band around it adds a rakish touch.<br />It definitely adds the finishing touch to an outfit.<br />It's very attractive and fits well.<br />It takes an outfit from ordinary to extraordinary!<br />We're very fond of it. It's a great hat and I recommend it."
4.0,Exactly as described. My wife liked them
4.0,Son grandes como me gustan fue una buena compra
4.0,"Surprised by the design and quality. Really nice. it is a Lovely design, versatile, and way more comfortable than expected! It was perfect for a low-effort costume to hand out candy,"
4.0,Good-looking product too bad it was too small my wife and my daughter aren't too different in size and they were too small for my wife and too big for my daughter. You probably want to go up a number size and up two cup sizes
4.0,Nice set of ties.  My husband really liked them.
4.0,"Not as wide as I'd hoped, and a bit small, but other than that, they're nice.  I love finding headbands in a variety of colors to go with different outfits."
4.0,Somewhat big.  I got this for myself not for my girlfriend..
4.0,MERICA
4.0,"Nice tunic, but runs small.  I will need to get a size or two bigger"
4.0,"The only issue with this dress was the length on my daughter. She wears a small and it was way too short, she is 5' 7. We had to return it."
4.0,"The watch is waterproof and having long time. It is simple to use. I like the features alarm, light, tells time and the style of this watch"
4.0,"I got the bag to keep to store stuff for winter like thermal socks, thermal shirts, gloves, and sock hat. Also keep flash light and multi tool in the inner zipper pocket.  About the zipper pocket,  I wish it was bigger and/or there were more of them. I can see it being filled up quickly for people who have more stuff that they don't want to store in the main compartment.  The bag seems to be high quality.  I can't speak about durability really because it just sits in my vehicle most of the time.  One aspect that I found a little bit of a disappointment was with the plastic teeth of the zipper.  It may be just fine,  but being carhartt I figured they would put a metal zipper on it. The price of the bag is pretty cheap compared to other similar bags.  Overall, I'm happy with the bag and I would recommend it. It's larger than I expected and I probably could have went with smaller bag."
4.0,"Bought an S size bandeau in beige Color for I am 5.6inch tall and weighs 140lbs. Love the way this bandeau snuggles to my body. Extremely comfortable and breathable material, the bands fits utterly well unlike the crappy underwire bras.<br />My purpose for buying a Bandeau was to pair it with off shoulder dresses and Blouses and it does the work."
4.0,"The finish of the sawing was not a good quality, not professional! It works but does not have finishing quality."
4.0,"Great quality of material and make, but probably only ""adjustable"" for the under 4 crowd or kiddos on the more petite side. If you have an older child or one with a big head/hair, this might not fit as well."
4.0,Smaller than shown
4.0,Pretty but much larger than I expected.
4.0,These little bunny earrings are adorable! They are very small and dainty. I gave them as a gift and the recipient really liked them.
4.0,Love the skirt! The material is gorgeous. Looks better in person. Only thing it’s really short I’m 5ft. So be careful when you pick up things. My reference is 31 waist and 38 hips
4.0,"Really pretty, not overly fussy.....love them."
4.0,I have several of these bracelets and decided to give one as a gift. My friend called excited to get the bracelet and has been talking nonstop about how much she loves it. There are a lot of bracelets like this out there but the quality of Alex and Ani bracelets are the best.
4.0,Very nice at the moment.
4.0,"Perfect for what I wanted it for (Ms.  Frizzle)! The sleeves were a bit shorter on me than I’d like, but the overall color and material was stellar!<br /><br />My kids loved that I came into work with such a fun dress! Well worth it!"
4.0,This purse is really nice in look and color but I was expecting it to be a little more handy. I needed a medium size but this is a little big to what I required therefore I had to return it.
4.0,"The color is bright like we were wanting, but after just 1 day of moderate use there was a small hole -- I will try to get a picture when I am able. Overall, a nice purchase, just wish it were a little more sturdy."
4.0,I wasn't too thrilled by the texture of the hair. It's plasticky and weird.
4.0,This dress is very nice. The only issue was that mine was missing a belt on one side so I had to return it
4.0,"I gave this is a gift for a 1-year old. It is adorable, well made and after washing held it’s shape. In retrospect, I don’t know if using suspenders on a young child is safe (for entanglement issues). But the suspenders are removable so the choice is yours."
4.0,Very nice belt.  Fits perfect with a couple holes to spare.
4.0,"Not real good to wear around your neck in the summer, however if you are indoors a lot it will be fine."
4.0,They came just as advertised. I don’t have issues with these I just wish they were bigger.
4.0,Bought for my tween daughter.cute but kind of chokes her a bit at the neck.x small hits her knee.Shes about 5 ft. She likes it but beware this thing really shows your bloomers when you twirl.Would have liked it a bit longer but Good value for a growing picky adolescent.
4.0,"Super cute, non slip and fun socks"
4.0,I'm usually a 4 or 6 and wear a 32DDD. I followed people's advice and got a size up even though I was super worried. It's supposed to have a loose fit so that was fine but the arms were snug. And my arms are pretty toned/slim. I'm glad I ordered a size 8. I wouldnt order this if you're more than a  8 normally. Especially if your arms aren't on the slim side. Not a lot if room for the fabric to give.
4.0,Fits well but a little pricey
4.0,"Nice , but smaller than expected"
4.0,"I like the design of it but, I didn't like there's two patch attachments at the neck."
4.0,runs slightly small
4.0,Love the skirt. It's sewn well but the zipper is cheap and keeps catching the cloth.Looks exactly like the picture
4.0,Great earrings. She will love them!!
4.0,"Great shirt but FYI it runs small. I typically wear a US XL, but due to the other reviews I ordered this shirt in an XXL, and it fits great! Stylish, fresh look, but runs small so order big :)"
4.0,I like the key ring but it is much smaller than I expected.
4.0,"The dress is a true pink, it is a chiffon material has a thin stretch nylon lining.  It is as the picture shows. I ordered a large, it is a little snug, but I will  keep as I am losing weight and should fit great a a couple weeks."
4.0,Beautiful and very well made.  A great deal for the money.  I love them because you can wear them with anything and everything.
4.0,Cute but kind of flimsy. Also catches my hair so it must be in a ponytail.
4.0,My 5yr old loves these sunglasses. They keep the sun out of his eyes and he looks cool
4.0,"The color is fabulous! I received this as a gift from my Christina list. I am very impressed with the quality. Double stitching at stress points, and nice zippers that WORK! This is not a mini by any means; small but mighty! It fits an iPad, or other 10"" tablet. My Samsung Note 9 fits in both outer pockets with a bumper case.<br />I am 6 feet tall with a long torso and the backpack straps are long enough and then some. The shoulder strap extends long enough for a smaller person to use as a Crossbows bag, but not me.<br />There is a spot that fits my kindle perfectly. 2 inner zipper pocket, the center one is perfect for cosmetic or meds. The main compartment is huge! You could seriously use this as an overnight bag! I did fit a16oz. water bottle in the side pocket. But that was with nothing in it yet. I'll update my review as soon as I've packed it up with what usually carry. So far I think it's a quality bag, very versatile,  and with a one year warranty how can you go wrong? My only grievance is the lining is a bit floppy but to me that's a non issue. Other than that, I would give 5 🌟"
4.0,"Pretty thin but feels like it'll hold up. People melt where I live because it's so hot, these will help keep cooler also."
4.0,"I loved the look of the bags. I thought they were a little bigger than they really are, but they are still worthwhile. I thought they would be a little thicker, but so far they are working out. I have not had them very long, so I will see how long they last. Very cute. Great for smaller loads."
4.0,Would have been 5 stars but fits Large. Other then that a Awesome Boot! Really good buy
4.0,"I used this dress as Halloween costume. I’m 5’7 , 128lb , 36B and I ordered size M. It has pockets.  Fabric is not so breathable, so you might feel sweaty. Length could be slightly longer, but it’s ok."
4.0,It’s very pretty! I almost kept it but sent it back because I wasn’t sure how my tank tops would look with this peaking through.
4.0,"I bought these as a gift, haven't given them yet, but I looked at them and felt them, they seem good quality and soft. The lettering is thick, so not sure how it will feel to walk on, but you can read it! And getting two pairs for the price was a nice bonus."
4.0,It's a lovely shirt. Very nice fabric. It just fits a little tight around the chest.
4.0,"I buy a new pair of these at the start of motorcycle season.  They provide the protection, clarity and sunblock needed to ride safely and comfortably all day.  The lenses on my last pair, were not quite as good as the ones in the past, but meh... could have just been me.<br /><br />Why a new pair every year?  Cause, I destroy glasses and these are quality at a low price."
4.0,Its so pretty and love how it fits
4.0,Ordered a size M for my daughter who usually wears a size 12 (L) because everyone was saying it ran large.  It fit pretty tight across the chest.  The shirt worked perfectly under a skinny-style tux jacket....without any bulk from long sleeves.  The pin-tuck pleats were well done and crisp.  There were two kinds of buttons....the round black buttons as well as flat white buttons.  There is even a small loop at the back of the collar so that the bow tie won't slip.  A good buy!
4.0,Gifted to someone who recently lost their pet picture reminds me of him.
4.0,"My girls love playing dress up with all the shoes and accessories. It is a pretty good value for your money. The girls seem pretty comfortable in the shoes and they have different heels on them. The shoes are durable, but the rest of the accessories are not the best with durability. Also I had to glue a lot of rhinestones back on."
4.0,Pretty but smaller than I expected.
4.0,I ordered this swimsuit for a beachwear party and I must say it fit perfectly. The material was good and the color is lovely. I ordered the XXL do to my breast size being 38DDD and it held up up perfectly.
4.0,One pair fit just as excited and the other was a tiny bit smaller than expected but still fits..
4.0,Really like the look with jeans
4.0,average craftsmanship but plenty of room and pockets...delivery was very slow
4.0,The case is cute. I did not keep it on my phone long as it was pretty bulky.
4.0,"Purchased this for my hospital bag - plenty of space for everything my husband and I will need. Hard to tell in the photos but the zipper has a rainbow effect that doesn’t really match the rest of the bag. Not a real complaint, just a little surprised. Bag did have an odd smell when I opened it, a little chemically, let it air out outside and it was much better."
4.0,Adorable boots. Get comments every time I wear them!
4.0,I love this shirt.  I love the fabric
4.0,I like very soft
4.0,"They're socks, lol"
4.0,"So cute, but SO SHORT!  Going to have to wear shorts under this one, and I'm only 5'4"
4.0,For the price you can't beat it. Kind of old fashioned looking.
4.0,They are bigger than expected.  Very nice rose gold color.
4.0,I normally go a size up but glad I didn’t it is true to size and so nice and warm. The only down side is it is kind of itchy but wash a few times in fabric softener and much better.
4.0,I thought this was a little pricey when I bought it but it has been running for a year now with no problems.  The fit and finish of the box is very good.  We keep my wife's watch in it which has to be mounted across the narrow direction on the foam insert but it stays securely.
4.0,"Really good exercise mask! The air flows better than a regular medical one and allows you to perform better in your workout. It does runs a little bit big, but great quality and material"
4.0,"This swimsuit is adorable and I love the matching headband. I've gotten compliments on it. The only thing is that the fabric is kind of thin, so it obviously won't last forever, but for the price I don't mind at all. Be careful too bc their was a button that came off and was gone when I got it but the seller was quick to reimburse me so I could purchase another one."
4.0,I like the design it has pockets
4.0,I love this brand a lot. My only problem is this pair came with the stitching undone on the thigh. And they were more purple than blue. A lot more purple.
4.0,"Cute dress and print! Love the pockets and tie back is slimming. Not see through, no stretch, it is shorter in the back so be cautious bending over. Material is non-breathable polyester like the satin linings in dresses but thicker, so can be warm. still debating to keep it because of this con thus my 4/5 stars. I'm 5'1 125lbs stats 34b, 25.5, 37, somewhat booty and thick thighs, usually size small, 3/4 or 25-26 jeans."
4.0,"I liked the feel and look of this product and the way it allowed me to breathe without the feeling of being suffocated. However, it tends to slide down. I tried putting it over my ears to stay up but I was sucking in material when I talked. I wish it would stay up, then it would be a good option for those who really don't like wearing masks."
4.0,"Fit is true to size. The pull string doesnt keep the boot fully closed at the top though, but my daughyer said they are comfy and warm. She likes them. Just wish the pull string was tighter at the top."
4.0,They were amazing only got to wear them once and they do not hold up to a tornado
4.0,"I love this bag! I bought in silver so it goes with everything. The pockets are great for handling life in NYC-there's one for my subway card, my Walkman, my phone. I just wish it had a zip top so people can't just reach into your bag."
4.0,"Super comfortable, fits great, looks great."
4.0,"I really like the comfort, coverage, and fit of the masks--actually covers under my chin and around the sides of my face comfortably.  I'm a teacher and it holds up all day and I no longer feel like I'm hyperventilating when I'm speaking for hours at a time!  Only downside is that it lasts about two days (2 8hr work days) and seems to be losing its shape after this so I dispose and get another one."
4.0,Looks good fit well for my size (w30) even though someone mentioned that XL was about american waiste size 30&#34; in another review. Knowing that though it fits. Sizing chart is wrong so beware.
4.0,"Looks nice, not fancy, plain statement of faith, not wealth."
4.0,Nice . U save a lot of money . Very convenient  easy to put in ur purse and go
4.0,Bought a size 12 for my nine year old daughters rock show. I was hoping they’d look like leather pants but these would be better for a dance recital. They run small
4.0,I’m a 7.5 and they are size 7-8. They are too wide and too big for me
4.0,I like this purse and all its pockets etc but I think the quality of it is ok? I will use it but it seems a little cheaper made then would I thought it would be?  I gave it a 4 star ONLY because I think it could have been made a LITTLE better but good for he price
4.0,It was super stretchy and fit great. But not for plus size girls who’s thighs rub. Got a hole in the thigh in the middle of my workout on the elliptical.
4.0,Good socks for a reasonable price.  Wash and wear well.
4.0,"Nice antiqued finish, but had anticipated silver color and mine was gold. Liked it enough to keep it, just using with different clothes than anticipated"
4.0,This is very lightweight and works well on cooler days.
4.0,"I have larger hands for a short person & I know one-size-fits-all doesn't always apply.  These could be a tad bit bigger.  But, they do stay on at night while I'm moisturizing my hands."
4.0,I really liked these. Thy fit my face good and protect my eyes well. Came right away. They are so cute and cheap.
4.0,it's well made but it fits a little bit small...
4.0,"The outfit was really cute and has alot of stretch. However, the top will leave you with underboob showing. Don't lift your arms too much, and if you have a lot of cleavage, maybe wear a secure bra."
4.0,Nice fit. Just what I expected but I think I ordered a size too big. I am hoping it will shrink a little when I wash it.
4.0,It's cute but the top isnt long enough but we passed it off as a crop
4.0,These were just what we were looking for. After 1 wash and dry they fit better.
4.0,"Nice looking shirt, very light material, great for hot days.  A little small in the chest."
4.0,"I read the reviews and don't understand the negative reviews.  The watch band is awesome, pretty, easy to assemble and connect to the watch part. I'm in love!  No green wrist either."
4.0,Beautiful shirt but too small :(<br />I was really looking forward to wearing this for Christmas.<br />This shirt is cute though.
4.0,Arrived quickly.  Item as advertised.  Love all Humble Chic products.
4.0,I love the design of the glasses.  I fits me alright.  Unless you were looking for something rounder.  It's sleek and definitely good for sports!  and casual fridays! or nights!
4.0,"This mask is comfortable, it stretches pretty well and I love the words written on it."
4.0,Very pretty but a little clingy in the tummy area. I thought it would drape down more but it's more fitted than it looks in the pictures
4.0,Little bigger than what i want but it fits everything.  Good....
4.0,Nice construction as pictured. Only complaint is it is very large
4.0,it's worth no more than the asking price
4.0,Cute pants but leaves sparkles everywhere you go on everything.
4.0,"Good material and I like the bifold design. The fourth card slot on the right side is a bit shallow, but no real flaws otherwise."
4.0,"Pues para fotos está chido pero a parte de la orejas, duele después de 15-20mns."
4.0,"Perfect for use while snorkeling. I'm glad I chose a Medium, as it fit perfectly. I am 5'1"", and 105# and this was very comfortable in the water."
4.0,Love it!  Fits perfectly
4.0,A little taller than I wanted it to be but it is well constructed.
4.0,Good leather wallet. Husband likes it.
4.0,It adds bling to any outfit you wear
4.0,Bought this for a friend who loves elephants. Beautiful bracelet. Vibrant colors and very well made.  Going to buy one for myself
4.0,Nice<br />It was a gift
4.0,Just what I was looking for.  These are easy to put on and the 4 colors give you just enough variety to match anything you want to wear. Not too big and not to small.  Just right.
4.0,"I love these socks! They are plenty long which is the hardest thing for me to find. I am 6' with long legs and these actually hit just below the knee. However, I wish they had just a little more compression."
4.0,In sole life and out on arrival
4.0,Exactly as pictured. Soft well made leather. Only downfall is when the zipper is closed the zipper tabs fall into the hole at the end of the zipper. But no biggie!
4.0,Love really cool. Great for beach or spring stroll in the park
4.0,"I have been looking for 16g bones pins or screws to wear in my helix piercing because I've found these L shapes to be the most comfortable. They are very hard to find in 16g so I was thrilled when I found this set.<br />On the plus side they fit great, just like I was hoping. Very comfortable. Also, they seem to have a good sparkle to them.<br />On the downside the gems are tiny. From the pictures I expected them to be a little bigger. They are just a tiny bit bigger than the diameter of the stem. If I was wearing this in my nose it would be fine. So that is no one's fault, just comes down to me wearing it in my ear.<br />So far a great product, overall."
4.0,"Lovely bracelet. I purchased to wear to a wedding. The price was great, but some of the stones were not glued center. In other words there were not perfectly placed in position. They were slightly off, thus reason for 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,"These are my favorite style of panties. This is the second time I've purchased these. The first time I bought size large, but since losing some weight, I repurchased in medium. They give me just the right amount of coverage and no panty lines. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the lace on one of the pair was not completely sewn together."
4.0,I'm 5ft 7in so I got the XL and it fits okay. I'm 135lbs more or less. I have a slightly bigger than average posterior so it works. I purchased an XL and L because I wasn't sure which fit best. XL was the better of the two but the top does rise up when I raise my arms so wear something underneath but the arm length is perfect :)
4.0,i got the bag cuz i wanted something that would not snag on the lift. I never keep it buckled on a lift and only hold it with one arm but i wish it had a bit more room.
4.0,I ordered a Medium after reading previous reviews of it running big and it fit well. I’m normally a large so definitely get a size down. Didn’t love that the slit is more in the middle than the side like as shown in picture. I ended up safety pinning it a little to prevent an unwanted show. Wore this to a wedding.
4.0,"Received my gloves yesterday.  I was reading a book on my LG g5 phone which seems to have more radiation than any other phone I've owned in the past.  My hands constantly burn and joints are sore.<br /><br />As I said, I was reading a book when the gloves arrived and I used the gloves all day since their arrival yesterday.  There is a marked improvement in my hands today. Much less joint pain and the burning is much, much less.  The gloves are comfortable and work well on the touch screen.<br /><br />My daughters say the gloves make me look like hamburger helper."
4.0,Brought these to jazz up maxi dresses for my vacation. Variety of colors and patterns worked across all my outfits.
4.0,"Be careful on this one, I ordered it twice- the first time it came in, it wasn't even the same shirt- the sleeves were long on it and it was just cheap and ugly.  I returned it, and tried a different vendor with better reviews because I really wanted to love it and it would have went great with my swimsuit at the beach, so I tried again and the next time was a success!"
4.0,Very nice with a soft drape and feel.
4.0,Outfit came as expected. True to size.
4.0,"they fit as I expected they would, the fabric is stiff (I am hoping it will soften with washing)"
4.0,My granddaughter love this necklace
4.0,Cut backpack but was to small for all my stuff.
4.0,"Breaks easy (what do you expect for this price) which isn't that big of a deal because it's not hard to bend the links back together. The metal has already started smelling rusty after just a few wears (over my clothes, too. So skin on chain contact will really wear it out). It's cute otherwise."
4.0,"I thought this was going to be a small post stud earring but they’re a dangle/hanging design. I’m not disappointed with them, I just expected something different! They didn’t come with actual backs either, I used my own, but I’m still content!"
4.0,"My wife bought this and she thought it was a great product, especially for the price. Size fit perfectly."
4.0,"Bigger than I expected. But great, especially for the price. I love it."
4.0,"Lovely belt, and I would recommend this to anyone."
4.0,"I love personalized jewelry – either my name (which is hard to find), my initial, or my zodiac sign.<br /><br />This necklace was also a bonus as it was also my birthstone (April/diamond).<br /><br />I want to start off with this gift box? It’s sturdy, gorgeous, and lighted! I’ve never seen one like this before and it definitely highlights the<br /><br />The chain is definitely sturdy, one of my pet-peeves with other necklaces I’ve gotten. The charm? It’s tiny. Really tiny.<br /><br />I’m not asking for a huge charm, but this can only be seen up close. Which in today’s time isn’t a good idea.<br /><br />It is pretty decent and the gift box rocks."
4.0,Bigger than expected for a XXL.
4.0,"Comfortable to wear and I got tons of compliments on them. They don't look or feel cheap. They turn around while dangling and so sometimes the back would be showing, but that's my only complaint. The gold is slightly brighter than pictured."
4.0,Purchased this for my husband. We had a very similiar helmet in the past that was also an XL and it fit roomier than this one. I'd say this fits more like a Large. We like the quality and we are keeping it even though it's a little snug
4.0,"Very flattering on me, I carry my weight in my belly and wanted to distract from it. Well it sure distracts because the only thing people see are my boobs about to pop out! This is a very sexy suit and is great for lounging in the water, but don’t do any diving or the wide chest just might let the girls out."
4.0,"As the headline states, I knew I needed to order 2 sizes up but I was willing to risk it, since the last dress I bought from this seller was so awesome. However this dress is a smaller XL than the last. It does look just like the picture and it's perfect - the sizing is not why I'm deducting a star. A true wrap dress, there's only ONE button to close it (besides the tie) and the chance for that failing seems rather high. So that's a bit frightening. But I won't be able to close the dress safely until after I've gotten my rowing machine. Otherwise it's a well-stitched dress. There's enough fabric (barely) but I can't fasten that button without tempting fate. It really needs 2 or so cleavage buttons and perhaps a way to keep the skirt from blowing open (moreso than other wraps - but I'm a pear). I'm keeping it because it IS a beautiful dress and I will be smaller soon - and I plan on reinforcing the button and maybe adding more. If you can't order 2 full sizes up then this might not be the dress for you. Because it's adjustable (in the right size) you'll want more room rather than less. Even though it's too small for me it's still very flattering after I pinned my cleavage closed (down to last rib!!) However the ruffle completely hides the pinning. Also, I have to be very careful when I sit because this will fall open all the way up (again, my risk/my fault). 100% poly. Crepe-y material is slightly scratchy but it's fully lined with a silky (yet breathable) material. It's not see-through at all. I wouldn't dare put this in the dryer because the fabric seems too delicate but it probably wouldn't shrink at all. I bought this dress because it reminds me so much of one I had in the 90s - and it does not disappoint. Really is lovely! So far this company is pretty awesome."
4.0,"These boot is exactly what I hoped it to be.  Comfortable and light, but great traction."
4.0,i love it but the rose gold wore off and now it’s mostly silver but doesn’t turn my finger green
4.0,Hands weren't cold
4.0,Got the medium width but they fit more like a wide.  Seem like a good quality shoe for the price but the insoles are a joke.  Much better now that I added a pair of Dr Scholl's inserts.
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful, but way smaller than I had in mind. I'm sure it's my fault for not looking at the specs better, but the length adds the hook part in there too. These are very small earrings. The silver looks great, and the etching is flawless, just make sure you measure your wanted length before making the purchase."
4.0,Waistline small
4.0,I honestly paid a bit more for a lot less. It's pretty tight around the foot. Especially cause I have a wider foot. But I don't have a problem with others of the same style or size. I recommend getting a Bruno Marc shoe instead since they don't run slim. Expected a lot more for this price. Might not recommend.
4.0,NO complaints from the family I sent it to
4.0,"Nice hat, good quality, but a little expensive."
4.0,"Very cute earrings, only problem is bar a little to short."
4.0,Granddaughter likes it but wishes it was a bit longer to accommodate her brushes
4.0,They are extremely tight at knee. Needed to  snip at top for comfort.
4.0,"I bought after reading the reviews and was sold seeing someone else wear it. Want to look like Chewy? This won't do it, but is thoroughly enjoyed by those around me, starting multiple conversations and good jokes. Mine didn't have Chewy on both sides but black on the back. It's very light and breathable and washes well. Only real complaint is they added his eyes too instead of cutting off below them (like how this style of mask covers your face) so I had to fold the top part to not see his eyes and get the full effect while wearing this. For under $10 well worth the cost and then some."
4.0,"It's very cute, but doesn't really fit my busty chest as well as I wanted. I still wear it, though, cuz it's way comfy and super cute."
4.0,"The best thing about this happy is that it has a cool, laid back look to it. It looks like a sun hat a hip, young city woman might wear. The floppy aspect of it gives it that quality. The downside is that its brim is not very wide, so there's really not a ton of protection from the sun. So it's more a hat you would wear for style than for protection from the sun's glare. But I'll give it four stars as a stylish piece."
4.0,The quality is great but it runs small. I ordered an XL because I don’t like my shirts tight on me. I had to send it back and reordered a 3X.
4.0,"Just wore this on the flight home from Honduras. It was thicker than the average material so it kept me warm on the plane. Probably would wear it out for dinner if I had another night in Honduras. It didn’t make me look skinnier, I felt a bit bulkier. Maybe it’s the way it fell, idk. If I’m larger in the chest, I’d fal one or use a clothespin for the top part. Cute though as it opens on the bottom and the top of the dress."
4.0,"Great for work, especially lite loads."
4.0,"It was a gift and my friend loved it.  She sent me a selfie picture message and it looked a bit smaller than I imagined it, but it was beautiful.  haven't seen it in person, but she is very happy with it."
4.0,Lovely shoe.
4.0,I was a little uneasy about ordering clothes online because of not fitting right.  Past experience your size isn't the size of what you order. But the dress fits perfect even around arms.
4.0,Nice for the price but somewhat fragile.
4.0,Its very thin but gets the job done... I don't like the tie closure and its a little small.
4.0,My daughter is very happy with the pygamas
4.0,"Great works perfectly, super comfortable."
4.0,"Item was as expected. Size however is not. I should have ordered a bigger size. And I bought an XL... it is not as stretchy as I thought so therefore it doesn't fit. But overall, nice top."
4.0,The legs were tighter than I had hoped but that seems to be the style these days.  Otherwise the are comfortable and the cors are great.
4.0,I purchased these for work- To look more professional in black pants by having on heels. I didn’t not want to be uncomfortable as I do have to walk a good bit during the day. The first two days I wore these there was a small blister on one of my toes. Then they were fine. Have walked a good bit in these. Have worn them for a while now. Very supportive and comfortable. This was my first purchase of this brand. I’ll be back for more in different styles. This brand seems like the quintessential working woman’s heel who is over 35 and wants comfort and class.
4.0,The material is soft. Not itchy or irritating at all.
4.0,"Wasn't sure of size, so ordered two.  Returning the one that is too large.  Love the shirt."
4.0,"Good for the price. Be careful with them, though. They're fragile."
4.0,I've not had any issues with these but I've only just received them.
4.0,"Super bargain!  Very nicely made.  Thought it would have hollow chain or be non metal because of price, but it is metal. Color more yellow gold than rose but still an incredible buy."
4.0,"Great plain black sweatshirt. Medium thickness- which is great for cold nights. It is more of a regular fit, so not very form fitting - just cozy sweatshirt."
4.0,Card slots were pretty tight in the beginning but they seem to be loosening up. Overall a nice slim wallet.
4.0,"This is a very nice quality jacket. It should be noted that the material feels like a polyester type, but would be good for spring and fall weather when exercising. It’s also a bit too small in the waist area especially, it’s made for a rectangular shaped body rather than hourglass and pear shaped. So keep that in mind!"
4.0,Great color! Quality material.
4.0,A little baggy in the waist... hopefully washing and drying over time will fix.
4.0,"It was a nice jacket, but the decreative material on the shoulder stuck up a bit too much for me. I kind of looked like the old captain shoulder decorations the Captain of a ship used to wear. Material was nice though. Well made and shipped really fast"
4.0,I just didn’t like how it fit on me however it was a cute top just not for me
4.0,"I, a women, bought these to replace some very cute ones that have no support.  The fit is great the high arch support is even better.  Wish they made them with a back.  I have to wear socks because my feet get cold."
4.0,A lot larger then what I origonaly thought this can not be used as a nose ring for me and my ears were not gauged at the time so I could not wear them as ear rings either.. but they are pretty just like the picture
4.0,"This necklace is a definite statement piece. I gave it four stars because it’s too godey for me. I’m more of a plain Jane type of girl, but I got many compliments from all ages. Those who love bright colors and big necklaces would love this set."
4.0,The white portion of the top is much more gray than white.
4.0,I use products from free soldier for a while. Because they are great.  These pants are not exclusion. But the price little bit too high.
4.0,The band is a little small.
4.0,Exactly has described and pictured. Comfortable fit and style. Definite must have.
4.0,It really does help relive the pain I feel when I first get out of bed
4.0,Xumple
4.0,"Real leather! Yess!!<br />ES makes these in a 'PU leather', which is truly pee-yoo. It's sharp & uncomfy.<br />I searched hard to find my size in the real leather version, & here's why:<br />I get a lot of pain across the top of my foot in sneakers due to high instep.<br />The elastic laces & easily adjustable velcro closure of this shoe helps get me thru the day without wanting to throw my shoes across the room after 2 hrs. Lol<br />Even with velcro, they don't look clunky.<br />The sides around the ankle come up too high tho."
4.0,Beautiful charm! It would've been nice to clean it before u sell it to anyone. it didn't fit my pandora so I took it to my jeweler and he made it fit :)
4.0,"Love the color, design and length but fits a little tight in the shoulders for a large size."
4.0,"Beautiful earrings!  I suggest putting them in the 2nd hole of your ears if you have 2 holes so that it holds up better on your ear on the way up, but other than that, these are so pretty."
4.0,The bracelet is just a little big for for my wife's wrist
4.0,It’s a cute shirt. It runs a little small though.
4.0,simple but pretty
4.0,"So far so good, I been pleased with quality of earrings. I did expect a bit larger."
4.0,First order came without the crystals. Requested for a replacement which came after a week or so. The replacement crystals have a tight fit in the pendant and don't shake very well. My wife still likes it nonetheless.
4.0,some of the small stones fell out . But my wife loves it and that is what matters
4.0,These socks are so comfortable that you can wear them all day!  I may purchase a couple more pairs in white.
4.0,"Very much a fast fashion piece, as it's cute and on trend but isn't constructed the best. It'll do for a couple of wears."
4.0,"Carried all summer as a backpack and/or over the shoulder bag. Carries lots of items and weighs practically nothing. It's very cute but the rope strap is definitely showing signs of wear.  As far as I know, there's no way to replace it so unless I try to trim the rope, which will be very tedious, it will look a little rougher than it should. The old sail for the material is a cool idea and durable but the rope part needs a little work. To expensive to only last for one summer experience."
4.0,"Fast delivery, Cute set as described but smaller than imagined"
4.0,Tela agradable
4.0,"I measured this bag and mine is about an inch longer and higher than Spirit's stringent requirements so I am afraid to use it!  I understand that it can be squished under the seat and all, but have heard horror stories over customers being made to pay $100 at the gate because they are over the measurements.  Anyone have similar experiences with Spirit?"
4.0,Me gustó muchísimo. Pero pesan
4.0,"Super cute, soft, and stretchy. To big for my 4 month old but I will save them and try again in few months."
4.0,"This dress is super cute, just as pictured and pretty true to size. I ordered my normal size medium and it fits pretty good. It's a good quality material too. It's not cheaply made like sum things tend to be on Amazon. Very happy with this lil summer dress!!"
4.0,These were a hit when we gave them to team members for an appreciation gift!
4.0,Love this… can’t wait to wear on my ginger snap necklace!
4.0,Estoy feliz con la calidad y el precio de el paquete. Definitivamente lo recomiendo y lo volvería a comprar nuevamente.
4.0,Pleasantly surprised when I opened the package (that had arrive way early) to feel the top was a thin sweater material. Soft and comfy. My only concerns are if it will pull with washing. It hasn't yet but I've only washed it once. Fits great looks flattering.
4.0,Liked the adjustable waist band and the light weight. Material seemed like it  would dry out very fast if wet
4.0,Love that the wheels goes anyway you need them too. Rolls really easy!  The only thing I wish it had was longer handles.
4.0,"Received 6 bags, 6 different colors, on time. The bags are the size and material I expected. The bags seem like they will be sturdy and they have wide handles. I put a few grocery items in one of the bags and carried it around for a few minutes and it felt secure. The bags do not fold into the pouch, they have to be stuffed, which means the bags will be wrinkly, but this is not a big deal for me.<br /><br />2 of the 6 strawberry pouch parts had stitching errors that spoil the look and closure of the pouch feature. In the photo which shows all 6 as strawberries- the 2 on the left of the ruler show this flaw."
4.0,Very soft stretchy and cute! Some loose threads. Nothin a lighter cant fix tho. Satisfied
4.0,"These gloves are soft and very comfortable and fit well.  They keep my hands warm.<br /><br />I don't find the following an issue for me personally, but it may be for others and that is why I only gave it a 4 since it's supposed to be a feature. I found that they don't easily work with my mobile device. Not a critical feature for me."
4.0,only downfall is you have to handwash them
4.0,An XL fitted more like a large. Fortunately I was prepared for that. I love this dress. It's perfect for the event I'm going to.
4.0,"cool necklace. it took awhile to get, but its cute and really great price!"
4.0,Awesome for boho bedroom. So nice to get embroidered covers.
4.0,I loved this suit. It was a hit for the parties. I got it in my size (medium) because I knew the bottoms would fit. The too took some trial and error adjusting the top so nothing would pop out but eventually I got it perfect. It just takes patience. I don’t think I’d go swimming in it. Perfect for Pool parties and pics w ya homies the wrap is amazing
4.0,Just wish they had pockets
4.0,Make sure you go 2 to 3 sizes up. Their dresses run really small. Beautiful dress and nicely made with a built in bra.
4.0,"pretty,"
4.0,"Cute, comfy dress. It is a bit low in the front."
4.0,"These leggings fit perfectly and looked great.... but after wearing them several times, they ripped in the butt area. Extremely sad because I loved the initial quality and fit of these leggings and the window to return them just closed ): I still give 4 stars because of how perfect these were before they ripped"
4.0,"These socks come 5 to a pack. They are a blend of 65% combed cotton, 23% polyamide (nylon type fabric made from plastic) and 12% spandex. They are a nice thickness to keep your feet warm but breathable. They come up to the bottom of my husbands calf and have good pressure to give nice foot and ankle support. The only ding in them is that they are a bit thick to wear with dress shoes as suggested but they are perfect for sports. They have a average price at just under $16 at the time of this review.  Highly recommend."
4.0,"you must get one size up at least, and if your at least 5 ""3"" you have to get it tailored because is too long. Other than that the dress is really nice above casual ."
4.0,My son loves these glasses.
4.0,We had an 80's themed graduation party and these proved to be the perfect accessory.  Everyone comented on them.  Good proce too.
4.0,Great sweatshirt. Didn't shrink after washing and drying.
4.0,"They were beautiful indeed. Nice weight and great look.  Having said that they were to large for my face, but I sent them back because they were scratched and one arm was completely out of shape."
4.0,"It’s definitely really cute. Looks like the picture I would recommend sizing up. If you have a thicker bottom (like me), I would say size up 2 sizes. The pants are super long, but it still was really cute. I will be ordering again."
4.0,Finally a good fit!
4.0,I love this skirt absolutely beautiful.  I bought it for a wedding. Since it is 100% polyester it is a bit stiff. When I was ironin it I noticed a small tear. The tear is the reason I did not give it a full 5 stars but it does deserve 5 stars if there wasn't a tear. Cannot wait to wear it again.
4.0,"Great little toiletry bag, some of the pocket seem a little odd on size but overall good.  Bag is well constructed, but dose not stand up well n it's own."
4.0,"This is a very nice, well fitting shirt in just the color I was looking for to match a skort I have."
4.0,I really like the overalls but had to send them back because the pockets on the back of the jeans sit really low. I really wish I could have kept them but I couldn't get pass that issue.
4.0,Really comfy and good quality. Worth the money
4.0,The buttons are too far apart but other than that very nice shirt.
4.0,Good but it fogs
4.0,Love it but the colors are a bit off. The dress is super long which I love because I wear a tall
4.0,Great item and highly recommend....AAAA++++
4.0,"Not bad for a masquerade style mask, but the multiple-ribbon ties are hard to work with. This look feels most suitable for pairing with a nice dark jacket or suit coat.<br /><br />On my XL (hat size) male noggin, the mask sits reasonably well, but could be a little more fitted to the sides of my face. My eyelashes brush the outsides of the eye openings a little, and those handy with makeup may consider using black eyeliner to avoid skin around the eyes looking distracting.<br /><br />Recommended for the masquerade ball look..."
4.0,"These PJs are soft and comfortable, but the bobble edging on the top was sewn in too tight. The top is very stretchy (maybe even a bit clingy) but the trim has no give at all. I had to cut it to let the material out because it was sewn slightly bunched."
4.0,I like the microfiber very warm and comfortable fit.
4.0,Nice quality and good size
4.0,"Bought as a Christmas gift.  It's a fun, afforable and useful item."
4.0,"I love it. I had to add a little bit of chain so I could have it just a touch longer, but otherwise perfect."
4.0,"It's larger than I thought, so good for thicker scarves. Not good for chiffon or silk or lightweight fabrics, though - it will slide off."
4.0,"Too small in the arms. It was too difficult to wear anything with sleeves underneath. Otherwise the quality seemed good, but returning."
4.0,"I guess I didn't understand the ""drop crotch "" part. I was just looking for brown jeans. They were cute and fit ok, but the drop crotch looked.. weird...like from the back was a saggy butt...from the front made my legs look short...didn't like them. Couldn't send them back because I would have had to pay shipping to China! Over $100...gave away"
4.0,The bulk tag cost seems out of synch with the cost for small numbers of tags but overall a good deal
4.0,"I didn't know if I would like this blouse or not once I received it, and I ended up putting it in the closet without wearing it.<br /> I have lost 10 lbs since then--so I think that had something to do with my initial perception.  It hangs so<br />much better on me since I lost the weight.  I ordered a larger size due to other shoppers' reviews, and I'm glad I did<br />It definitely runs small. The color is also very pretty. Looks exactly like the color pictured.  It is sheer though."
4.0,"If you are expecting a normal sized parasol of this sort you will be disappointed. They are about half the size of the hand painted parasol I bought for use in the sun when we go places in the summer. However, for a child the size would be perfect.<br />This item is great for crafting. My daughter painted one for halloween to look like a poisenous mushroom cap and it turned out great to go with her costume."
4.0,Style is beautiful ; Fabric not as expected ... Thought it would be a heavier wool-like fabric but I stil ; love it ; Thank you !
4.0,"Wife purchased for me as a present.  My first personal robe.  It's a plush type material, almost like wearing a large towel.<br />On the warmer side.  Fits very well and extends down past knees.  In general, a good robe."
4.0,Looked great but was much too small in the bust and I am not a small chested woman. But I am sure others find this suit lovely and I did too except the bust. It looked nice on from below the chest. It was actually quite slimming and the material was nice and think. The colors were lovely and the suit was very well made!
4.0,"Bought the champagne color but it's much darker than the picture. It's more of a shimmery beige but for the price, I can't complain too much and other than that, they are indeed sunglasses."
4.0,"The cup part fit big but the width was fine. It worked, just did fit so won't be wearing it often."
4.0,"Very cute shorts, but definitely not for larger girls. Legs are a bit narrow to be flattering. Nice quality!"
4.0,"I like the high arch support and deep heel cup. I can wear these for hours, standing and walking, they do not hurt my legs, feet or back. I do wish they were softer and thicker. I own several pairs of orthotic flip-flops. Some very expensive high-end brands and some others that I've never heard of. For me these come in on the low end of my collection. They are better than a dollar store flip-flop certainly, but they are not very shock absorbing. The bottoms are a bit harder than I like.  I do like the thick fabric strap, it fits my wide foot and does not dig in. I wear them for the nice navy color, but they are not my favorites."
4.0,"I own two pairs of CompressionDR socks. I wear size 11 shoes and am 6' tall. I bought the large size which fit well. Socks come to about 1&#34; below my knee. I will buy a third pair, this one size medium to see if I like the tighter fit better over the next few days."
4.0,One came with a beautiful chain. Not fond of the other chains.
4.0,This cute adorable &#34;Big Sister&#34; T-shirt hits the mark for our 3 year old granddaughter. It brought big smiles and added to the growing excitement on the arrival of her &#34;Little Sister&#34;!
4.0,"Nice, nothing wrong with them. Nicely made, just tight if you have a wide/full face."
4.0,"The lens quality is very good for an inexpensive pair of sunglasses. However, the lens are easily scratched, at least in my experience. If you take extra care storing the glasses, it shouldn't be a problem."
4.0,This scrub set runs small. I normally wear a medium and I ordered a large after reading other reviews. The large is a good fit for me. The material feels thin and stiff. I hope with repeated washing it holds up well and softens up some.<br />The pockets in the top are deeper in the front which helps to hold items in when I have to bend over. I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing the top without an undershirt. The side panels are pretty neat and a unique detail I haven't seen before. I do not like the ties and I don't feel like they bring anything to the scrub top either in fit or style so I cut them off.<br />The pants fit well and are long enough to fit me. I'm 5'9. They do ride up some when I sit down but I've never found a pair that didn't do this. The pants have a pocket on each side which I love. The way that the material is sewn allows my belly to pooch out some. I wish they have a denser material to prevent that.<br />Overall this is a good quality set. Not my favorite scrubs ever but the price is very nice and they got okay. I received a discount on this set in exchange for a fair and honest review.
4.0,I like this bag.  It's a nice size and lovely leather.  It's easy to find things in the bag.  Only complaint is that is a little difficult to close. Overall very happy.
4.0,"Really nice. I bought it for myself but my wife loved it so she kept it. I do not see how the chain will work though, I need to find a small ring to insert it in the small chain and then connect it with the other end. Other than that, looks fantastic."
4.0,"Sexy and comfortable! I'm wearing them to my outdoor high school reunion! I ordered a Large (I'm 5'6 and 140 pounds, Size 8) and they are great. Medium would've been too small. Only complaint is there isn't quite enough room in the trunk for my big butt (Lol!)"
4.0,I love it but the material is a bit thin and see through
4.0,Nice comfortable top. Fits well and seems well made.
4.0,This shirt was so cute! I didn't expect the sleeves to be attached the way they were though. The sleeves made my arms look slightly pudgy so I cut them off and it looks amazing and I love it!
4.0,I love the idea of a zipper pocket for phone and other odds/ends.  The scarf was quite wide which made it quite bulky.  I think with a hoodie or long-sleeved tee it will be okay but probably not to tuck under the collar of a coat.
4.0,"This is an okay jacket, but not the most comfortable. The feel of the material is very course, even for a wind-breaker, and moving around is... ""crunchy"". The zippered pouch and tacti-cool patch on the arm I don't care for, but they are functional."
4.0,I've this dress. I received the wrong shade of blue but since I dont have a printer to print the return label I couldn't send it back. The size small is a too big but I can still wear it. If you pull the ties with too much strength they will fall off. It washes well. I have not put it in the dryer.
4.0,"Mostly effective, although the rubber bungs became a little uncomfortable behind my ears after a while, especially if wearing a hat."
4.0,"This was received quickly & within the quoted time. I ordered this to add to my collection of pea coats. I like this because it had a different look to it. And because of the material, it could also be used as a rain coat. The coat was comfortable and fit like a true large. I am 5'3 165-170 lbs, 38 DD. I was able to close the coat with ease. I would recommend and i think this would also make a great gift."
4.0,"Love the dress. Shipping was expeditious. Material appears to be durable. I've gotten a TON of compliments on it. I won't wear it anymore now that the weather is getting warmer but I can't wait for next fall/winter to pull it out of my closet again.<br />During the Fall, pair with open toe sandals or booties. During the Winter, pair with closed to booties and a pair of tights. Very classy dress.<br />Wear it as is (no need for the fancy peticoat, unless you want a super dramatic look). Also add a belt sometimes to change up the look up and accentuate the waist even more. Thank me later :)"
4.0,Still love love love the dress. However it is much too small even though I ordered the size I normally wear
4.0,Daughter loves this outfit she wants another one next size up
4.0,"This fits the 49mm ultra just fine, works as described. Good price as well."
4.0,It's great for a Ness Halloween costume.
4.0,"This did fit as expected and I loved the design! Especially loved that it had Hogwarts in big letters on the back. Just wish it would have been a bit thicker material, but still a good buy."
4.0,Not as cute of a print as i imagined not as bright... seems to work well at keeping hair from going all over. I cant gwt it to fold up snall for storage tho as i was sure it was possible. The kid didnt complain as much about itching so i suppose he liked it
4.0,The fit was perfect . Liked the 2 shades of the Stockings. Will recommend to anyone.
4.0,Great gift for dog lovers. Shirt is of good quality. Would buy again.
4.0,"These are nice and stylish but a bit too rigid for my tastes.  They also seem to scratch pretty easily, but I’m pretty rough on them."
4.0,It is a beautiful shirt but i wear a xl and i order 2x and i couldnt fit it over my arms/shoulders lol lol so yeah its a no go. Will have to return
4.0,Would have been 5 stars  but runs small have to return<br />  Would recommend just order  a couple of sizes  up
4.0,"These are very nice, look like high quality. They do run a little large though."
4.0,"This is a very cute dress and form-fitting. It is stretchy and has a ribbon style and feel to it. I typically wear an XL to XXL and the XXL fits me. However, due to the ribbon style, it has extra space and I would have been better off with the XL for a more contour fit as it was a bit loose on the top and bottom. I'm also about 5""6"" for reference.<br /><br />The qualify is great! The dress is not thin or thick, but a nice in-between. It is comfortable, and not restricting at all.<br /><br />The only issue I had with the dress, is that it didn't have any marks or tags on it. So, you have to fumble around to see which way to put the dress on. There is one tag, near the bottom of the dress with the size on it. However, it isn't a biggy just something I found odd."
4.0,My daughter just moved to Wisconsin.....she worn it and was the &#34;talk of the party&#34;.  She loves it. Great color and material.
4.0,Really looks like a Pandora bracelet. Really nice.
4.0,Good as a liner under motorcycle helmet.
4.0,"I tried the bicycle leggings in size One Size.  I have 28"" waist, 38"" hips.  They stretched to fit me, but were a bit too snug in the hip and definitely the waist was too snug for comfort.  I would worry about tearing the seam at some point if I kept them.  The waist band unstretched was 24"".  So use that for reference if you order One Size to determine if it would be comfortable for you.  I am going to order a different color from New Mix in Plus Size and see if that fits me more comfortably.  I like how this brand of leggings is high rise and sits near my waist.  Other brands can be low rise, and no one wants to show ""plumber's butt"" from their leggings."
4.0,"It fits great but can't be worn as a strapless, at least not for my size. Without the strap it just flips under my boobs."
4.0,Once tailored; absolutely lovely. Shirt runs large but once tucked in and fixed with cummerbund looked fine.
4.0,Very cute a little big but cute 😊
4.0,"Update: New design looks promising. Fits well, doesn't fog.<br /><br />Strap ruptured in just second use. It has never happened to Speedo or TYR or Nike goggles. Seems to be a quality issue to me. Let's see if they stick to their guarantee.<br />&#34;Hassle Free, 12 month guarantee!<br />If you don't absolutely love your new Aegend swim goggles, we will replace them or refund your full purchase price<br />I'll update the review if they take any action on it.<br />UPDATE: SELLER WAS HELPFUL AND QUICKLY SENT THE REPLACEMENT. I HOPE ATLEAST IT GOES WELL THIS TIME."
4.0,They are gone for an inexpensive pair of shades.
4.0,Love them. A tad small but great quality.
4.0,Wish the bottoms were like shorts
4.0,"This dress is VERY comfortable and soft. I wish I would have bought it in more colors. The pockets are not very deep though so I was not able to use them for any big items and was worried about ID/credit cards falling out. Overall, this dress is a great dress that is very comfortable and cool in the summer months. I’d recommend it to anyone."
4.0,Awesome ring i would have gave 5 stars except it was a size 2 big.if you wear a size 10 make sure you order size 9. The color was a little dull but all in all it was a great buy.
4.0,Adorable! Happy with purchase
4.0,"This cover up is really cute.  It looks pretty good on my body type.  The lace seems sturdy and the product seems to be made to hold up for awhile.  It will definitely work for me as a cover up but if you are much taller than 5&quot;3' I can't see that this would cover your rear.  It comes just below my cheeks on me, and I'm kinda short!  It looks perfect over my new teal bikini and I am excited to use it for my upcoming vacation.  It definitely looks beachy!  It is possible that you could wear it over a tank as well, especially if you are tall.<br />It was a little stiff when it arrived but I think it will soften up in the wash.  I'm hoping that means that it won't fall apart quickly!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
4.0,Love it fits great just collects a lot of lint on top part of dress
4.0,"Got it as a gift, very cute and it helps that it’s adjustable! I wish you can see the paws a little better but for the price it is great."
4.0,"This is a must have fashion accessory for owners of the soon-to-be iconic Kia Stinger. It also works for bee farmers and wasp control technicians. First of all, the seller is playing fast and loose with the meaning of ""structured."" Don't take that to mean substantial, or well made- just shaped in a general form that will sit on your head. It is not like a fitted major league cap (nor is it priced as such). It's more of a thin polyester cloth beanie with a small visor. I wear a 7 3/4 (large brain, I know) and I have to shave my head to get this on. It fits like a skull cap. Which is what you might expect for $12.50 (plus shipping).  If you like a thinner, less bulky, small lidded hat and/or you have a small head, this is the item! Avoid if you are going for the douche bag look. Will probably fit your smaller, less brainy head a lot better. I'm keeping it. It's the only one out there. Nice subtle dark gray color with barely discernible stitched Stinger script. Three stars for size and structure. Five stars for value. Do the math."
4.0,I love my pink tent however its hard to zip in the front and is NOT water proof!!!
4.0,"These bibs are nice.  They are good quality and are comfortable.  They work as they should and the style is great with the mesh chest piece.  My only complaint is that they run VERY SMALL.  I wear a large in pants and shirts, and I ordered and XL in these and they are still on the small side.  I am making it work but probably would prefer an XXL."
4.0,"Pretty great buff alternative for the price. Took two washings to get the weird smell out (use baking soda). Seems similar in texture and thickness to the UV line of buffs. Only complaint so far is pretty petty, but the edges are cut a little crooked. Color is nice and mellow, will be perfect for face covering for archery hunting season."
4.0,This organizer works just as i expected it to. The build quality is pretty decent but definitely not as rugged as some other key organizers.  It feels pretty sleek in the pocket and pulling keys out is easy.
4.0,I like it. Would recommend.
4.0,"So is my head.  They seem a little heavy on the nose, but look super stylish!  They also tend to touch my forehead.  I'd buy them again."
4.0,La tela excelente
4.0,"I really likes this ring a lot. it is very detailed and the concept is cute especially for a Bully lover! I have had multiple bull dogs and this was a great find. The one thing that i do not like detail wise is the eyes. they were put on a little crooked and they seemed a bit too big proportionately which I understand is just a ring but they didn't seem to really fit. Another thing that i didnt really like is in the details it says this is easily adjustable to fit almost any one, well i have really large fingers and this was a little tight but it fit me just fine. the issue with that is i didnt buy it for me i bought it for my 11 year old as his bulldog was stolen. I went to give it to him and this was nearly impossible to adjust. I am pretty buff for a lady too. i ended up having to have my boyfriend struggle to adjust it. now that it is adjusted it fits with the paws touching.<br /><br />Other than that it is really cute and i think i am going to buy one fore the entire family. the quality is great and has great detail. so far my son has been wearing about 2 weeks and dont see a sign of any wear.<br /><br />I was able to receive this at a half off discount and am really glad i did. I am going to go buy more at full price."
4.0,My legs and feet are so much happier since I started using these shoes for my spin classes.<br />The only down side was that the shoe sizes were hard to figure out for me.
4.0,"These earrings are of nice quality. The hoop size is just right. Because there are three colors, they go with everything."
4.0,"Well constructed, fits well"
4.0,"Very pretty! Not sure why it is unavailable anymore but it is flattering, the sleeves makes your arms appear leaner. The décolletage is stunning, hits just in the right spot. Material is soft as well. Giving 4 not 5 stars because it did shrink a little upon washing."
4.0,Very see through. So cute i wore on my birthday. I wore black shorts underneath. It was tight on my waist so its not really one size fits all. If my stomach wasnt small for my weight it wouldnt have fit. But i still gave it 4 stars because it did its purpose for what i wanted on my birthday and it was 90 degree in mexico when i wore it.
4.0,One of the tie broke after 2 washes. Fits as expected. Fabric quality is good for the price.
4.0,"I love it, it is a little bulky but besides that it’s amazing"
4.0,I love this dress! I got a purple and blue one. The material is awesome! I ordered XL and I should have sized down one size! It's stretchy!
4.0,"I loved the overall fit and style of this dress, I did return it because the bottom of the sleeves were just a bit too tight and rode up and stuck on me. I guess thats what I get for arm workouts.  This really has a great vintage look with lovely material."
4.0,"Super cute, but need more of a variety of sizes."
4.0,the top was a little too big and I'm pretty full chested. I just tucked and pinned it which turned out fine.
4.0,"pretty dress, fits well, overall pleased"
4.0,So comfortable. Loose in the legs but not too much so. Sleeves are the perfect length. I would recommend these PJs.
4.0,I like the shirt a lot. Just a lil smaller than I anticipated.
4.0,"I bought this to layer over shirts for golf. However, if anything is in your pockets then they hang down below the bottom of the shirt which looks weird"
4.0,had to return it to small
4.0,Love the look but the clasp keeps popping loose
4.0,"This band is as advertised… but I took a chance and ordered for a 20mm Seiko Field Watch.  With a little Dremmel modification to the plastic band attachment points I made it work.  This is a pretty soft material and a not so aggressive hook and loop.  My guess is that it will frey with extended hard use, but don’t know that for certain yet.  It is comfortable and facilitates an easy on/off."
4.0,Super cute! Might not fit a baby with super chunky feet (or chubby ankles). Haha!
4.0,Great sunglasses. Nice shape and size. Love the light weight frame and the blue of the lenses. They have a grey color tint to the lenses as you look through and they are polarized which is great. My only wish is that the lenses were a little darker. On bright days I'm still squinting with them on.
4.0,"OK, I have a large head.  Somehow I was expecting this to be stretchy and it is not.  I can release enough of the adjustable strand in the band to ALMOST fit. I love the hat, and I will see if I can add some elastic in the connector in the back to make it work for me.m  There is ample shade and I am using it in my convertible to protect my eyes."
4.0,Very nice and the initial stands out
4.0,Fits perfectly everywhere else except it’s too long
4.0,"A little heavy to carry, but really terrific for keeping you dry."
4.0,"I bought this because it was cute & the reviews were mixed & there were no pictures to see if it was good or bad. I'm 5'6&#34; 140lbs & I wear a 34D. I bought the medium. The bottoms are snug. The top fits me, but not like it fits the model. It covers my boobs but you can see underboob through the mesh. It doesn't look bad. I actually like it. In the pics you can barely see the underboob. & I have on underwear so the bottoms look weird, but they're fine."
4.0,"Got these a lot sooner than expected, they are really cute and very light so it's comfortable to wear all day. The backs that they came with slip off so I had to by separate backings."
4.0,I could have done with a size smaller. Nice dress to go to relax in.
4.0,The panty is really cute! Along with the nipple tassels. My partner usually wears a size small panty so I thought these would fit fine but they were a little small on them unfortunately. Not too small to where they couldn't wear it though so they were still able to dress up in it for me. But they had to put them on and take them off with caution so they wouldn't rip accidently.
4.0,"These tanks are amazing... this one the material was not as light as the others I bought. Other than that/ amazing shirts, great cut and fit’"
4.0,Came sooner then expected. very stylish
4.0,I love that you can wash the hat with the pom pom removed or inter change it.
4.0,"Looks good, fits good. Elegant and also very comfortable! Very happy with it, can wear it out to a nice dinner or night out & still feel very relaxed in it  (I think the material is cotton with lace at the top)."
4.0,"The product is great, but gives after initial wear.  So training shoulders for proper posture is challenging. May require a second system."
4.0,Love fit great
4.0,"I wore for the first time yesterday. Loved the way they feel! I've heard they may not hold up and last long, so I'm waiting to see about ordering more. If they last, I may buy one in every color!"
4.0,This is perfect! I give it 4 stars because the rope is a little too big and the bottom fits near ideal. I'm a pear shaped 5'4 gal. I got the 5x (sounds scary but its just a number).
4.0,I bought these as a gift for my Mom. She loves them. The hoops are pretty flimsy and the flexible metal piece that inserts into the other side was loose so it would stay ‘latched’ I used pliers to crimp it in place and it’s holding for now. I will probably get nicer hoops to put the humming birds on. I still think it’s a great price for them. Even with buying nicer hoops it’s a better price than other sellers.
4.0,Fits comfortably and has a great field of vision as it wraps around the face. The fan was surprisingly quiet!<br /><br />One thing I wish it had were interchangeable nose pads as my bridge doesn’t seal the gap.
4.0,"The dress is adorable, well made, but more like a tunic top. Looks cute with leggings, but I had purchased it for my daughter to wear as a dress."
4.0,nice shirt for school uniform
4.0,"Nice fit. Comfortable. It has faded after several washings. It's a cheap top, so not entirely unexpected, but it looks like it's been in and out of my closet for a couple of years rather than a couple of months."
4.0,Super cute. The top is a tad shorter than I like because I have a long torso but it's still good. Runs a little small in that way.
4.0,"These clips work great, I need to buy more of them."
4.0,"Great sweatshirt, but runs a little small after being washed. Otherwise awesome."
4.0,"This is my second Timex, same model. Old one began stopping for no apparent reason. Not related to battery. Love the size. It's a man's watch, but the right size for me. Easy read and love the ""indiglo"" feature. I did not like the leather strap. Found it too thick and difficult to put on and take off."
4.0,"The chain is longer than expected and arrived on time, even through the storm."
4.0,"This true to size shirt is quite flattering. It is made of thinner material that works for the warmer months and dressy enough for work. I gave it 4 stars since one of the seams came apart after wearing it 4 times. It is mendable, thank goodness"
4.0,"just a hair too big, but i like baggy, so it worked out. i actually bought it with the intent on attaching designs to it and customizing it in different ways, so i'll also add that it took the new material very well, and has held together the last few months great so far."
4.0,"Perfect fit, soft, merino wool, good price. This is a great beanie BUT it is thin so it isn't very warm. It's a perfect choice in light wind or temps in the 40s. Would also work well under a helmet."
4.0,I don't really notice the wicking going on (I'm kind of dismissive of my feet and generally wear wool socks).  They do show about normal shoes as well.  The feel tough and so far don't show any wear after maybe twenty washes.
4.0,They're pretty and arrived when promised. I would have gave them 5 stars if it wasn't for them being smaller then I &#34;thought&#34;.
4.0,"This is a super cute and well made dress for the price, except for the zipper!!!! My husband zipped it and as he'd did, the zipper split.  Prob just a bad one.  The dress also has its own petticoat :-)  unfortunately, I have to return it and couldn't wear it to the wedding last night."
4.0,Really nice for young girl becoming a  a teenager even women will like it for causual and to display for fun. A bit fragild
4.0,Great sweater. Comfy fit at first. Shrinks after several washes causing the sleeve length to shorten. Sleeves no longer reach my wrists.
4.0,Jacket was too small. I suggest going up 2-3 sizes. Got a M and it fits like an XS
4.0,It spins!  I thought that was so cool!
4.0,"Nice crisp cotton blouse.  It is large for me, but I am a tiny person.  I feel as though it is wearing me but I will keep it."
4.0,"Beautiful dress that will be perfect for the holidays. It is slightly too large, especially in the bust and waste, but it looks easy enough to fix. Overall, it is a nice dress, and is pretty good quality."
4.0,It's a beautiful blouse! It's almost like a soft denim material but definitely buy the size you normally wear. I am 5.1&#34; and 128 lbs I usually wear small and sometimes medium depending the style but I ordered the medium and it's huge! I should've ordered the small!! I just wore it with a stretchy belt and looks cute still!
4.0,"Really cute, has a side zipper. Fabric on the bottom is stiffer than expected, hopefully it will soften up with several washes. It's not very 'swishy'. Has pockets, plan to wear with denim jacket. Reminds me of something I might get at the loft. Right above my knee at 5'2. Top is like a cotton tank. Not too low neckline. Colors are true. Large fit me great and I usually wear large or XL in most clothes, size 14."
4.0,Little bit on the thin side other than that these are great styling yoga pants love them
4.0,I’m a size 14/16 and 5’8 195 lbs and they fit fine! Good quality didn’t look cheap
4.0,This is a pretty dress but too small if you have even a slight mommy pooch.<br />I may try ordering up a size...or two.<br />But the fabric does not give at all. There’s no stretch.<br />Definitely order a size up.
4.0,La blusa muy bonita..
4.0,I choose this for the color.
4.0,"These are warm and comfortable indoor shoes that will not break the bank. Moreover, if you lose them or somehow ruin them, their low price means you will have no regrets. For me, these slip on relatively easily and what I expect from a slipper:  they keep my feet at a comfortable temperature and don't prematurely fall off of my foot while I am going about my business at home. The fit was true to size for me.<br /><br />The 2 items keeping these slippers from receiving a 5-star rating are:<br /><br />1)  the fuzzy layer of fabric under the ball of my foot is starting to show some minor wear after about a month. Nothing too troubling at this point but does hint that these slippers will likely need replacing in a year or two.<br /><br />2) the outer, bottom portion of the slipper is durable, and although that is good workmanship, the sound the slipper produces as a result of the hard bottom when walking about on hardwood floors is loud, especially at night.  The loud sounds when walking around make my location in the house obvious to everyone.<br /><br />Unless I stumble upon another interesting pair to try, I anticipate buying another pair when needed."
4.0,"Nice shirt , pearls stay on with regular washing. Good price"
4.0,The material is a little thin and not really what I was expecting but it's a cute saying and it's just for working out. If the material was thicker I would rate 5 stars.
4.0,i liked the style and the size was just right it made a great present for a special friend oh yea
4.0,I don't see the slimming effect but they look nice!
4.0,Just what I wanted. Very comfortable.  The only concern is that it the colors fade from the chlorine in the pool.
4.0,This outfit is very cute but the material is very thin. You have to be mindful with your undergarments because you can see through the pants.
4.0,"Pretty much what I expect it, item has all the desired space I require."
4.0,"I double checked their sizing chart and wear a large top. The two I ordered are large, but I can barely get it over my head and doesn't cover my 38"" chest. Tooooo small. Nice quality though"
4.0,Love the way this dress looks.
4.0,Very nice vest
4.0,"It’s pretty, runs small, looks like lingerie and it’s suede. I suppose if you just want a peekaboo effect under one of your favorite tops it will work.<br />Was it worth the price? It’s ok<br />Will it draw attention? If you know how to coordinate an outfit.<br />Will you wear it often? Yes probably<br />You can’t go wrong with a black sexy top just size up a little."
4.0,"Very cute dress and it fits well. Not lined and advertised as a dress with pockets. Pockets were shallow and not functional which is why the 4 star rating. Overall, a good buy and came when I was told it would."
4.0,these are the pefect length and came in an adorable mini drawstring bag. overall loved  them  but they didn't glow bright in the dark unless you put them up to a light for a few minutes
4.0,"I got one of these for myself and the other for my best friend. I was a bit disappointed that the mask was separate from the hat, but she absolutely loved it! She is a walker , and was thrilled to have a nice , thick , cozy mask to wear all winter long!! This would be the best for outside use, such as tailgating, outdoor sports, or skiing. I haven't worn it yet, but it fits perfect. Cute idea and the mask is as nice as hat!"
4.0,"I love this bolero, it’s the right color and size I got the Large and I leave it open, I use it with sleeveless dress to add some modestly.<br />The only thing is that it’s warmer than what I thought. Bought it for summer/fall but it’s too warm for Texas weather."
4.0,Girls love. Perfect for gymnastics.
4.0,"This was a gift for my husband. These items do not come from the US but, they fit better than US boxer briefs and hold their shape much much better after many washings.  Last time I purchased these, the color selection was not the greatest, but this time, it was much better! It does take a few weeks to receive so if you are in a hurry, it may not work for you.  Still, he loves that these hold their shape over time!"
4.0,Pleasantly surprised by the good quality. Fits well.
4.0,"Unfortunately, Amazon ran out of this before I could get my hands on a pair so I scoured the internet and ended up finding the person who makes them and I purchased it directly from her.  The earrings are beautifully made.  High quality hardware went into making them. I am a bit disappointed that they are not as dark as the pictures shows. The swirls on the bead go from a light to medium pink not that rich raspberry the picture shows.  I will keep them because they are unique and quite pretty but I wish sellers would put use the right lighting with their products so that one doesn't have that little pang of disappointment when receiving an otherwise beautiful piece. The other site where I found them had the exact same picture.  I will definitely buy from this jewelry maker again but will ask questions about color next time.<br /><br />The color thing is the only reason for 4 stars, otherwise it would be a non equivocal 5"
4.0,"This dress runs really small. I usually wear a 2 or 4 in a dress, but ordered a 6 after reading reviews. I wish I had gotten an 8! The 6 was super tight on me. Over the course of the night it stretched out a little (which was great in my case). The neck is very high and takes some getting use too. This dress is a perfect length for me. I got tons of compliments on the dress and felt pretty sexy. Im 5'8 125lbs and wear a 32C."
4.0,Personalized for 'grammy'...was exactly what we wanted..Great price and I know my mother in law will love it! So cute
4.0,"I ordered a size up, so it was a bit big. Otherwise, it's fine, cute too."
4.0,Fit good. Good buy
4.0,"Coat is nice, color is darker than I've expected."
4.0,"These are awesome pants. Other reviewers are correct that the texture is soft and cozy.<br /><br />Product comes in a Man Store bag with a card inside from Yo Shopping. They make a good product, but could use a new writer."
4.0,"I loved that these sport briefs sat higher on the hip. They also had a very appealing cut and styling to them that I admired.<br /><br />The downsides that I could see is that the waistband wasn't as elastic as I would have liked and the back on some of the pairs didn't stay in place and felt loose occasionally.<br /><br />I have a slim figure (118lbs, 5' 8&#34;) and these briefs really framed my body well with their taller cut. I am a fan!"
4.0,"Love it!!! Got it for my reborn for memorial day.... Only complaint is that the shoes aren't real I should have kno better... A full outfit with headband leggings and shoes for 15 bucks.... The ""shoes"" are really slippers that can't be wore outside unless u don't care about completely ruing them but luckily for me I just got this for a doll and not a human baby lol"
4.0,Flowy and fresh
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. Great price for this bikini. Only one negative, I ordered a medium and top fits like a medium, but the bottom is more like a small...since I purchased for my vacation that I leave for tomorrow, I will be stuck using the top but having no use for the bottom. Overall though, the top alone is worth the price."
4.0,but they will fit soon and seem great . . .
4.0,They are the right size but they tend to move down my leg over several hours so I just pull them back up. I am 5'7&#34; at 150 lbs. They are warm. I would like to find attractive compression stockings that are breathable. I preferred the Fytto stockings better (fit and feel).
4.0,I use this underwear for support and to be more comfortable. It may help prevent chafing.
4.0,Upsized as recommended by previous purchasers. Love it.
4.0,The item arrived at time and everything was ok. They look very similar to the Tom Ford Cat eyes glasses. Thanks a lot!!
4.0,They are comfortable and fit my fat face. The only problem I have is slight fog in the window however that could be me not prepping correctly.
4.0,It was a little snug for my husband.
4.0,"I was a bit disappointed when opening them. They are made of a canvas fabric and not leather. After wearing them, however, I was pleased with their breathability. I purchased them a size smaller than I usually wear and they fit snuggly at first. The more I moved in them the more they loosened up. The leather on the soles was already slick and allowed for some good spins right out of the package. I'm not sure how they would hold up to heavy use. All in all they're exactly what I what would expect for the price."
4.0,"I ordered a Large, but they sent me an XL :(<br />Still it is a great dress. Quality is very good."
4.0,I’d size up one! Fits a little snug and makes it low cut.
4.0,"I received good service on this order, though the postage was more than I bargained for, making the price of the earrings pretty high.  I bought them for my daughter who had them on her wish list."
4.0,Too bad these run as small as they do. I wear a size 7.5 to 8 in a boot and I could not even begin to get my foot in. The did not have large enough ones so I had to return
4.0,Colors! No blue though!
4.0,Too much hat and heavy for lightweight backpacking.
4.0,Quick shipping.  Nice product. Is as expected
4.0,Fits perfect! Quality is pretty good.
4.0,They look exactly as they do in the picture. Arrived promptly and have thus far performed well through several wearings. Not too big or too small and so far haven't irritated my sensitive ears.
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. It flows nice in the bottom. Please note, the lining doesn't go all the way down. It goes right past you butt. Therefore, the dress is see thru on the bottom. I like my legs, so I don't mind. However, if you want to buy this dress to camouflage your legs it won't work. Also, the top is too small for a DD breast. I have to wear a tank under it. See picture. I'm a size 12 or large. I'm 5'3&#34;, 180lbs."
4.0,"I bought these for my husband. He wasn’t crazy about the color I chose (light brown/khaki), but said these are very comfortable work boots. He said most boots with toe protection take a while to “break in” but these felt comfortable from the first time he wore them. He said he would recommend them to anyone working on their feet most of the day."
4.0,Looks great and fits true to size. Not see through so definitely an added bonus. I wore mine with a thick belt and it looked great. Good for holiday family parties. Great price.
4.0,Balls screw off while wearing
4.0,"This shirt fits as I expected it to.  It is a loose fitting, A-Line shirt.  If you want a tight fit, either order 1-2 sizes smaller than you normally do, or get a different shirt.  I have straight hips and this shirt definitely flares at the hip.  I wouldn’t say that it is the most flattering for my body type.  The material is stretchy and comfortable.  The neckline is lower than a standard t-shirt."
4.0,I expected it to be more of a thicker yarn type of material but like it just the same. Fits great and looks sharp.
4.0,"I was concerned about the size after reading some of the reviews, but found the 10.5 wide spot on for me.  So far I am enjoying the shoes and I think they are a great value.  I plan on buying a &#34;backup&#34; pair if I can find the same deal of 39.99."
4.0,"Im 5’2 130lbs with a 34 B cup. I ordered a size medium but it seemed to be to big for my chest area. I pinned the side to make it fit better. Over all this dress was perfect for the 1920s party I attended. It was comfortable, appropriate and looked like I paid more money for it."
4.0,"I have to say I'm very happy with these family pajamas so I came back quickly to review them. They are very soft, super cozy and a good thickness. The do run more slim fit and on the smaller side so size up at least on size. But they are very stretchy and comfortable."
4.0,These earrings were smaller than I was expecting. But still very cute. I don't like wearing heavy or big earrings so they were perfect for me. Would be good for a child as well and my 11 year old has already asked to borrow them. I would recommend!
4.0,Cute well made size up 1-2 sizes
4.0,fitted shirt on the large size. otherwise everything else is fine
4.0,"Stylish, functional, well made but heavy."
4.0,"This dress is very pretty with quality material. My only thing is, is that I am very curvy and the dress hits me at the knee. Wish it was a tad bit longer for modesty so I will either take the hem out or add a touch of tulle at the bottom."
4.0,"The metal seems like it's thin and breakable though it's not. I've showered, exercised, and slept in it and nothing has gone wrong. The threading is short so it seems like it doesn't  tighten well but as long as it's as tight as it can be it shouldn't fall out. The only thing I wish was different was for the fletching to be the same on both sides. You'll have to turn it so the right side is facing out."
4.0,Good quality. Fits quite big. If I didn't need to wear it this weekend I'd return for a smaller size but I'll make do with it the way it fits now.
4.0,"Love these, I get compliments daily and the weight is good to help you stretch up slowly. In 2 weeks of wear one of my ears is ready to stretch from 12mm to 14mm.  My issue is, they look like a clear Quartz geode dyed purple. They could be an amethyst dyed more purple too. And I got confirmation from another Crystal & rock enthusiast that they definitely are a dyed geode. Regardless they are pretty but I would love it if it was the natural stones color."
4.0,Not too thin and not too thick - perfect for jogging.
4.0,I love these earrings on. I found them difficult staying on my ear unless I squeezed the pieces together.  Then it became sore. They are very sparkly and cute.
4.0,Overall I’m satisfied because 78 of the charms were dragon’s. The other two I have no use for a bird and what I think is Jesus. The dragons are perfect for my project.
4.0,Loved the dress just too small
4.0,It's nice and for the price was worth it.
4.0,"Perfect carry on for my 4 year old. She fit her ipad, headphones & snacks. It is sturdy & cute & she has been playing with it since our trip."
4.0,The negative is that they are very slippery on the bottom.  I had to rough them up to avoid slipping on carpet and ceramic floor.
4.0,"I bought a dress with a similar print and it was fabulous, so I thought I'd try this shirt.  It's ok -- but the fabric feels sort of dense.  I hope to wear it this summer, if it doesn't turn out to be too heavy."
4.0,Runs small as the reviews stated. I’m only 5’2” so the length on me is great. I’m a size 10 and I usually Buy medium dresses. But the large fits without being too tight (or too loose). The sleeves are also loose which I don’t like. But for $15 it’s nice and I’ll wear it to weddings!
4.0,"Careful, the white is rather see-thru.."
4.0,"It is a cute shirt, but not only does it run a bit small, it is quite thin."
4.0,Love these for riding. Definitely help cushion my palms for long rides. I ordered a medium based on the measurements provided but I think I could have ordered a small because they are a little loose on my wrists.
4.0,"I love this dress, but it doesn’t fit as well as I’d hoped.  It’s very soft and stretchy, and would be the perfect summer dress, except it needs more room in the chest.  I ordered according to the measurements.  I wear a 40F, and because of my chest the waist ride high up on my rib cage, and the length of the dress gets pulled up.  I like my dresses at or below my knee, so that didn’t really work for me.<br />It’s still super cute, and would be a perfect summer dress if you like your dresses shorter, or are not as bosom-ly gifted.  Lol!"
4.0,"Wife likes these ok. They are sturdy, though."
4.0,"Its not for the cold of Feb or Jan in the North. Its just to thin, that said the pouch pocket is really useful as long as you don't bend over (why would you be doing that anyway?????) but its really useful. The only downside is the material is thin so its useless for the cold winter weather but a chilly spring morning or a fall day it might be fine for."
4.0,I like this dress but I ordered the wrong size.
4.0,Didn't stretch enough so i had to wear the item around my belly button but the fabric was nice looking with its designs. The stockings were a good fit an looked quite well
4.0,"Short girls beware, this dress is long.<br /><br />I'm 5'2 132 pounds, I ordered the large but should have gotten the medium for a better fit.<br /><br />The material is thick and is not sheer or transparent.<br /><br />I would buy again in a smaller size.  Perfect for the office with heels or sandals for brunch."
4.0,"I probably wouldn't pay full price for these, but they are definitely better quality than basement price glasses on Amazon. They are a pretty bold look, but my wife was happy with them."
4.0,It's  a lovely bracelet set but it was too big for me and the beads (8mm) were way to big for my small stature. ...Over powering me ....the colors too bright for my taste. Should have looked for something more subtle and muted.  I'm returning it and look for something more appropriate.
4.0,"Fits great, keeps me warm without having to wear extra layers"
4.0,It’s a watch that keeps time.
4.0,"The mask works really well, it does irritate the ears but was able to pad ear hooks."
4.0,Zipper only goes to the waist. I thought it was complete.
4.0,"I bought these because I have Occipital nerve damage, a TBI that causes extreme light sensativity and daily  migraines."
4.0,"Nice, and can be washed in the washing machine."
4.0,"I like this cardigan. I wear it with a tank top or short sleeved shirt with leggings. It is comfortable and warm. So far the material is holding up well, though I do not dry my sweaters. It is nice enough to wear to work."
4.0,A gift for my neice for christmas.  She liked it.
4.0,"The straps on this bra is purposely made short to bring the breast farther up. If the straps were standard length then the amount of lift would decrease. Because the straps are short, they can feel uncomfortable on the shoulders. It is bearable but it isn't as comfortable as standard strap lengths. I haven't ever seen my breast look so full and perky, this is a new look and feeling for me. Well made and very sexy is this bra. I highly recommend it to women who have a smaller bust and splayed breast like myself."
4.0,"Love the socks got as a gift for my husband... only thing is not one size fits all...they are kinda tight, but he likes that says that feels like compression socks. The words also give him comfort for walking and give more stability."
4.0,Nice dress a little to long. I chose this color because I wanted a dark brown dress for the fall was somewhat disappointed that it was a lighter brown. Not as pictured
4.0,Well made product. Would have given a higher star rating but the sizing seemed to be a little off. I suggest ordering a size smaller than you usually do.<br />Wear under gloves or mittens to add warmth and comfort.<br />I use these gloves while I wait for my car to warm up. Helps keep my hands warm.
4.0,The dress is beautiful! It is a little bigger than I expected it to be. BUT... It has POCKETS!!! That was a wonderful surprise!
4.0,"Okay purse IMHO, bought it as a gift"
4.0,"I love the look of these shoes. However, they caused blisters and rub so much on the ankle bones. I can’t wear them that often or for long periods of time."
4.0,"These earrings were purchased with two other Chisel brand earrings, and I'm now a Chisel fan. These earrings are very pretty and move well.  However, I gave only 4 stars because they're light enough that they fell out of my ears several times throughout the day.  This could have been avoided if I'd had a rubber stop on the wire to hold the earrings in place, but rubber stops didn't come with these.  Still happy I got them, though."
4.0,I really like the mask. Good quality. Mask is a little too wide from nose to chin and the nose piece doesn’t tighten enough.
4.0,Excellent go to bags. Excellent value for money they are smaller than I expected and can be carried into the store ( several at one time)
4.0,"Nice, but if it were just a little longer on the neck is my only suggestion."
4.0,"The beads were a bit brighter in colour than I was expecting, but it is a very beautiful necklace and I'm glad I have it.  The colour really pops.  Now I just need earrings to match."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:3ceee9e1ed56ec510ebdafbdbe587b27]] They are absolutely beautiful love the shine and shimmer !! Rhinestones kind of fall off easily so you have to be super careful with them I accidentally made one fall off just while trying them on … so handle with care
4.0,"This dress is so beautiful in person, I got so many compliments on it, however the cups are VERY small, I am a 42DD, they cups looked out of place, I wore a black bra for it to blend in better but in light you can definitely see the cups are not right. Overall a beautiful dress but use caution if you have large breasts"
4.0,"Stretchy, but thick material. Looks fancy and fits well."
4.0,Really helps keep my feet warm at the bus stop. Especially good under another pair of socks on those super cold days.
4.0,"These vintage looking socks are so pretty.  They are a little thinner than what I would call medium thickness. They aren't too warming for winter, but they are nice to wear. I thought the stitching would be uncomfortable, but it isn't. They were a little snug going over my heel, but they fit comfortably once on. I have thick calves, but these reach a little way hoop and still fit okay. If you have thick ankles, maybe pass on these socks. All in all, I'm happy with them."
4.0,dress is so pretty
4.0,It is as advertised.
4.0,"This dress is nice.  However, the skirt part is very wrinkled when you take it out of the bag and the directions say do not iron.  I hung it up in the bathroom during a hot shower to try to steam the wrinkles out but that didn't work.  It's not high quality fabric but still a pretty dress."
4.0,Liked the softness and front knot.  Nice fit.
4.0,Under my granddaughter skirts
4.0,"I bought 4 of these skirts in different colors and I am pleased with the quality overall. They are comfortable and versatile. The colors and fit are as expected and the fabric is soft and flowy, if a little bit thin. It is worth noting that the skirts shrunk after the first wash, so while they seemed a bit long on me at first, they shrunk to what I would expect of a midi-length skirt (on me, 5'3"", the XL hits just above mid-calf.) I am pleased with my purchase and would order again. In fact, I'm already considering buying a few of the maxi skirts for when the weather gets cooler."
4.0,"I received this item today.  It came just as advertised.  I had to make some slight modifications in order to make it fit my wallet.  I took the section and cut 3/4'' off the part that inserts in the the card slot in my new wallet.  I rounded the corners and then installed it....perfect fit.  Had I not completed that process, this insert would have been sticking out of the top of the wallet, which in my opinion would have made it worthless.  You receive two inserts as advertised which gives me a spare when the first one wears out.  All cards that I don't have to be worried about ID theft were then inserted......If these last at least a year, I will come back and upgrade my rating to five stars.  The material appears to be thick enough to last for at least a year.  I have no problem recommending this product."
4.0,I thought it was going to be smaller and softer. I was disappointed that the sleeves aren't sewn folded. The pattern of the shirt is deceiving; it looks like it should be a softer material. The T-shirt itself is adorable! I love that the silhouettes have colored hair!
4.0,"Nice earrings, decent quality, nice sparkle, a little smaller than expected."
4.0,Pretty necklace. Decent price.
4.0,"I would say get your size, maybe go up ONE size if you're in between sizes. I decided to listen to the person who said it was 2 sizes too small. This is huge on me. I could have gotten away with a large. Usually I'm a medium. But with clothes that I order on Amazon it's hit or miss if I need a medium or large. So I just went for the XL. Huge mistake. But I ordered that. So it's my fault. My advice on sizing is go with your size. (Unless you like it loose or in between sizes. You can see on me that the waist is elastic, so it does come in. If you're large chested there's room up top)<br /><br />Now on to how I feel about the dress itself. I knew it wasn't cotton or anything when I ordered it. The material actually isn't bad. What I didn't like was the buttons don't really button. They are just like mock button up. That's too bad, because I think it could look super cute if you wanted to unbutton a couple of the bottom buttons and wear some knee high boots.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like was the tie at the waist is just a tie. As in just string sewn onto the front of the waist. That erks me. Not only would I be happier with the wrong size I ordered if I could cinch the waist in a little, but I think it looks a little cheap when there's a fake tie or fake button closure on things. Charge me the extra 5 bucks to make the button holes.<br /><br />But still, in all honesty, I would still wear this. It's pretty cute. And extremely comfortable. I'm just going to take it in a little. I've already spent an entire day wearing it."
4.0,"Super cute. It's decent quality. Only thing I didn't like was that the ribbon is more red than the actual band, which is more of a burgandy.  Stays on my toddlers head tho, so that's a bonus."
4.0,"Good product, but a bit small in the scrotal department."
4.0,"Like others have said, this hat comes wrapped in the warehouse package and has an odor that can be washed out. Otherwise, it's exactly what I thought it would be!"
4.0,"I really like these shorts.  Has a little stretch so they are not tight at all, I ordred a smaller size and they fit very good."
4.0,"These are very, very tight, very supportive and I feel much better when I wear them.  They are, as the manufacturer says, extremely difficult to get on.  I wish I had known there was a device that would help  me before I tried to get them on.  Amazon carries the devices.  Buy one."
4.0,Pretty good but has strong scent like a rubber 👎👎👎👎👎👎
4.0,"These have something of a brownish tint to them, which I wasn't found of.  They do a nice job of reducing glare, though, so I now wear them for doing yard work on an overcast day and they're great.  They're not quite as good as a more expensive pair I bought since, but they generally do the job of which they're intended."
4.0,I wore mine different without the sleeves. Dress is true to size. You may need dress tape to hold the top in place.
4.0,"Ok so maybe others can’t see your soul. But they will be able to see every single detail of your undergarments. I found this out the hard way when people started coming up to me telling me! Wear a slip or something. Otherwise it’s a gorgeous dress, beautiful pattern and color. Not warm either, obviously— since you are basically wearing tissue paper!"
4.0,Love the style and fit.  So cute.  The only dislike I have is the fabric; I'd like to have a little more cotton and less polyester as the fabric would breathe a little better.
4.0,They're good but they're really wide.
4.0,Hard for a younger kid to put on
4.0,"It's cute. Fades quick, but I wear it all the time. Also rusting by the clasps onto the rope part. Again, I wear it all the time including in the water. It also rotates on my wrist and the clasp ends up being the part that shows even on the tightest ring. No fault of the manufacturer I guess."
4.0,Great colors and great pockets that a cell phone not only fits but hides in. Only down side is that it is a bit polyester feel. Will need to see if a few washings help.
4.0,Great dress. Compliments my shape. The large is a bit big but if was comfy. Will be getting in other colors
4.0,"I recieved this on Monday, and was a little leery with some of the reviews I read, but needed a retainer for my snake bite lip ring for an upcoming c-section. It came super fast, and I like that there are a bunch of them just in case, but wasn't a big fan of the studs as they didn't seem as firm as my bioplast studs. Someone on one of the reviews had mentioned this wouldn't work in a bioplast labret stud if you were to just put the top of the retainer into it as normally you'd screw the top piece of the bioplast into it. However, with mine I have always had to push them in as screwing them never worked, but the top piece of the retainer seemed a bit thicker than the tops of my bioplast pieces, but decided to try it on one of my bioplast studs. I was relieved when not only did it fit perfectly, but it was sturdy and took some effort to remove, which is what I wanted, and my original top piece of my bioplast still fit perfectly in the stud afterwards. I've been wearing it ever since, and am extremely happy with the results! I feel most comfortable using my own bioplast stud, but the retainer stud would probably be just fine for a short amount of time. I wanted to keep mine in for a while though so I didn't have to worry about it just before the c-section, and could focus on the baby and not having to remove and replace my lip ring right away. It isn't very invisible however, so if you need to hide it I'd suggest using make up, and then cleaning that area really good afterwards. Mine seems a little on the shinny side, almost as if I had the diamond still in, but flat. The reason why I gave a 4 star instead of the 5 was because of the stud, however this product is absolutely wonderful and I'm very happy with it! I added a pic so you can see what it looks like on me and with my bioplast stud."
4.0,Super cute leotard but it runs a little on the small size which is surprising because my daughter is really small for her age. The mesh material on the chest even showed my daughter’s nipples.
4.0,Works well but after wearing it all day at work it makes my jaw hurt. Definately works to keep glasses from fogging up and easier to breath. Does take some positioning to get the right fit with each mask.
4.0,really good quality and design
4.0,"This was a gift to my niece...<br /><br />It fits fair enough (a little large) but she can wear it. Materials are good enough, even better than I expected. It comes in a bag inside of a box.<br /><br />Looks pretty similar to the picture and she really likes it, for me was a nice purchase."
4.0,"I’m 5’ 3” and the strap was too long for me, and the bag goes almost down to my knee. Great quality dor the price though."
4.0,Bought to go with my Myra bag I got for Christmas. Keeps my keys perfectly in the loop designed on the bag. Love the cow print in the design.
4.0,Fit as stated.  Received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"Got these for Halloween costume. The seam line is nearly invisible and they seem to be of good quality. They arnt heavy at all, but thier not light enough to wear backwords either. They are balanced to wear one way and one way only. On the top of your head near the front. If you have a small head I wouldn't sugest these. I wear large hats, but my head isnt huge or anything. So not for childeren, but these would likely fit most adults. The headband is quite large and fits fairly loosly my head, so im not likely to get headaches just from wraring them. They wouldn't stay on through any acrobatics, but they arnt likely to break when they hit the ground either. OverallI think they'll be a great addition to my Tifeling outfit."
4.0,"I use it for walking, running, and driving. A little bit hard to install lenses but had to give a little force to install."
4.0,"I like this dress, but it wasn't as flattering on my body type as I would have hoped. I 'm 5'5&#34;, 165lbs, 34DD and I orderd a small based on reviews. The cinched waistband sits in the perfect spot, but it just didn't look right on me - maybe it was the color.  I ordered the light green and the material is almost spandex-like.  Stretchy and comfy, but almost see-through.  It looks like a dress that would be perfect as a maternity dress, which is what it felt like on me - but I am not pregnant.  The small length hit just above the floor and I prefer to have my maxi dresses touch the floor even if just a little bit.  Would have liked the length of the M better.  Overall great dress for the price, but will be returning."
4.0,"Update:<br />After contacting the seller and sending pictures of how the umbrella broke, they sent me a new one for replacement and it came faster than the original. Great customer service.<br /><br />Shipping was faster than expected.<br />the way they packaged it to ship worried that I would open the product and it would be damaged, but it wasn't.<br />Cute, my 2 year old loves it and can use it with no issues.<br /><br />Update: after only two light uses, the umbrella broke. Didn't hold up like I thought it would"
4.0,The watch keeps time & is everything is is said to be.  So far a good bang for its buck. My only unmet expectation is that I thought it would be a little more heavy duty.
4.0,It's a good glove for the price. Not very effective below 20 degrees F.
4.0,little bigger than expected but very comfortable
4.0,"Very soft, true to size. Can't wait to wear it"
4.0,Much higher quality than expected will definitely order more.
4.0,"I got this kimono this past summer. It was beautiful! Its very light and flowy. The only complaint I have about it is that it goes a little farther down in the front than I expected, so my boyfriend kind of thought it looked like a bathrobe. The back came to little lower than my butt and the front came down to about my knees. Once I pinned up the front it looked perfect. I wore it with a white tank top underneath. Very pretty mint color, I would buy it again. I am 5'5 and 130 lbs. Fit loosely but not too much, and I am able to wear it to work."
4.0,"I love the print of this dress! Vibrant colors!! it still ran a tad small, especially in the chest (disclaimer I’m a DD because I’m nursing a baby right now) I’m a 12/14 and got a large. If you’re a 10/12 large is fine but if you’re a 12/14 I would suggest ordering Xl. There is no wiggle room. Seam came undone when  I tried on because it was too tight."
4.0,So far so good. Wore them once and they felt pretty good!
4.0,Super cute tie and good quality but really intended for smaller children. Had to return because it was too small for our 7 year old.
4.0,Very cute. Makes a nice statement. Goes with a lot in my wardrobe. It was a good buy. I would recommend it.
4.0,"Great little hat. Packed it for a trip and it survived nicely. 5 stars for the hat, except that when I ordered it in brown, I assumed both the wide ribbon around the crown as well as the narrow ribbon on the brim would both be the same color. They're not. Black one on the crown, brown on the rim so just be aware of that."
4.0,"Fit,appearance, and finish were all good.  Delivered on time."
4.0,"I gave it to my boyfriend for his bearded dragon. The chin strap is a little small, but I also like to sneak it onto my cats head, so it gets more use than expected."
4.0,Stepdaughter loved these shoes but they started to fall apart after 3-4 months.
4.0,Cute dress. Love the pockets. Im 190 and 5'2. I should of ordered a medium. Very baggy.
4.0,"When I first got them delivered they were great and had a nice length, but after the legit first wash it shrinks to a small size almost. I still wear it for the gym but not for any outside events now which was why I purchased them."
4.0,"I am a 32B bra size and the small fits me great. This has padding, but it’s not as thick as other sports bras I’ve had in the past. This also comes down a little lower on my torso than I’m used to. Overall, this bra is great for working out in."
4.0,Shipped fast and all in great shape
4.0,"Nice product, shipped fast"
4.0,They keep your fingers warm. Not especially good<br />for the phone...but then what gloves are?<br />Very good value
4.0,I would have liked one bright color like red.
4.0,Really like the watch.
4.0,Loved it! Comfortable
4.0,"I usually wear xsmall, but I got a small and it fits well. I usually like my workout clothes a little looser, so I might try a medium next time. Other than the love the material of the shirt"
4.0,My four years old daughter loves them!!
4.0,"I am 5&#34;8, and typically am a medium in most dresse. I purchased the large after reading the previous reviews and glad I did.<br />For the price this is a great dress. I intend to bring it on my upcoming island vacation as a comfy, cute dress. It's adorable."
4.0,"very good quality, make beautiful jewelry."
4.0,Somewhat difficult to change linkage and also to change the date. Otherwise an outstanding value for the money.
4.0,"Thermals for skiing, should be a nice base layer"
4.0,"My 5 year old son wanted Mickey Mouse ears for our Disney World trip.  It was surprisingly hard to find as most are Minnie Mouse ears.  These were the perfect size for him.  He said they were comfortable.  The threads started coming out towards the end of our week at Disney, but for the price they did their job."
4.0,I thought these would be more of a rough-cut but they are very finished/ polished looking
4.0,"This dress is a cute summer dress. The asymmetrical hem is cute, but as a curvier girl it is a bit shorter on me than it is on the model in the picture. Cute with sandals!"
4.0,Vibrant colors. Affordable. Purchased larger sizing as recommended & glad I did.  Perfect!
4.0,Was pleasantly surprised with how efficient the solution actually is. The brush is pretty tough - makes getting some harsh marks off possible.<br /><br />Only wish there was more solution in this kit. Will be buying more in time!
4.0,"Attractive. I thought they were the mesh type instead the are cloth, but I still liked them."
4.0,"Pretty good feeling leather for this low of a price.  It does squeak a bit at first, but I am sure that will stop after a bit of use."
4.0,"Serves the intended purpose; nice broad brim, and I like that it can be stuffed into a bag. And the pony-tail cut-out is handy. Wish the brim was just a bit stiffer though."
4.0,"My husband has a number of minimalist watches in his collection so I asked him if he could try this Men's Minimalist Black And White Quartz Watch by BRIGADA. He immediately liked the very stark minimalist appearance of the dial. This BRIGADA is a simple 2-hand analog watch without a second hand. After setting the watch, my husband brought it to his ear to be sure it was actually ticking. Throughout the day, he checked the watch and found it running and keeping time accurately. My husband really liked the black on black color scheme of the dial, case, and watch band. The watch definitely gives off the sleek, modern, minimalist aesthetic. He also liked the contrast between the white minute hand and the black dial, which made the minute time easy to ready. Unfortunately, in lower light conditions, it was a little difficult to read the black hour hand. There is no lume on this watch either, so my husband can really only use this watch in better lit conditions. That said, my husband found this watch comfortable to wear on his wrist. He also found the watch very slim, allowing his shirt cuff to slip right over it. He noted that this watch also has a ""BRIGADA"" signed, black buckle, which is a nice addition considering its very affordable price on Amazon. All in all, if you like an affordable, slim, sleek, well-working minimalist watch, and don't mind the legibility issue, then this BRIGADA might be for you as well."
4.0,The dress is beautiful but the extra large ran a little big underneath the arms. I could've gotten it taken in but didn't have time. Overall good price and good material
4.0,This is a nice lightweight hoodie that pairs nicely with leggings or yoga pants. Comfortable if you have a bootie and are looking for something long go a size up
4.0,Really wanted to love this on me!! it's so pretty and I love the style. Unfortunately it was just too short in the butt area for me to wear it out to brunch or anywhere. Might be good for the beach!
4.0,"I love this.  The magnet is weak, but I just super glue it...  It still pulls on and off just fine."
4.0,"Works fine for my inexpensive watch, and fits my big wrist no problem.<br /><br />It just used a jewelers screwdriver to remove the old plastic band, and install this one.<br /><br />Looks good on the wrist, and has a great price.<br /><br />Finish is a matte black&#62;"
4.0,"Very cute, but were a little tight on my 7 year old girls."
4.0,"Sweater is nice weight and fit. The shirttail part is a bit odd since it has to be ironed. Kind of difficult to iron a few inches hanging off a sweater. Could do without the need for ironing; perhaps if they used a thicker cotton, such as broadcloth, it would not need ironing. As it is, shirt part is handkerchief thin."
4.0,These compression socks are very comfortable. I suffer from restless legs are night so using these have helped me a lot. They were a little loose on my legs however i was able to still sleep comfortably without the annoyance of my legs moving. Great purchase!
4.0,"The glasses are fine with the exception the picture shows the part that goes around the eat to be tortoise shell in appearance, which is what we wanted.  However they Are Not.  I was very disappointed in that."
4.0,I loved the colors and fabric.  I  didn't like how they didn't stay put on my feet.  Maybe they're too big or just not for me.
4.0,"Man, look. I am so unbelievably average, like large side of avg - ok? And you can tell there's this ridiculously named ""park pouch."" What a dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb name for a great idea. I don't know if it's the marketing, or the soft material keeping the girls up out of the park, but I like it. Not matter how stupid the name is.  Really, who is in charge over at... Saxx? Oh... I see.  Good luck with all that. Nice pants though."
4.0,"Loved the dress, it just didn't fit my short frame on the top as I'd wished, returned"
4.0,This is a Christmas gift for my son as he loves this game. Shirt is a little thin but I love that because he gets hot easily. Came very quickly as well.
4.0,Love the colors!  Exactly what I need foe several outfits!
4.0,"This is made of a very good material for the price point, and is super cute.  The fit is very weird though in the back, and there is a fair amount of extra fabric in the lower back area which I can't imagine would be useful for any body shape."
4.0,"Nice dress! It is a little bit more red than the picture and the lace sleeves are a even a  little bit more red than the body, only noticeable when up close. It fits really nice and the fabric is great."
4.0,"Fabric is a little thin, but it fit well."
4.0,"No real form/support to them, but keep my boy's feet warm and he loves Lightning McQueen! Will definitely only last 1 fall/winter season though"
4.0,The quality of the material it's good ! But they are a little bigger for  size L !
4.0,"It is good quality, I just wish it was smaller just for bulkiness,  My Son wants to fit it in his pocket and the sword is kinda sharp ... it is cool how it hooks in the back and is seperate from the mask . nice design  ..just a little large ..Wishing it was the color of original mask ... more the classic look... ,But he loved it he just got his license and it is now his key chain ! He is a huge collector!"
4.0,I do not like it very much
4.0,For a gift. Clasp was loose on one item
4.0,"Love the color & style. Looks exactly as pictured. The buttons are not attached well at all. When I tried it on a button fell off, not from snagging or anything it just was really loose. I sewed it back on. The first time o actually wore the shirt out another button fell off! There’s only 3 buttons so it’s not a big deal for me to sew them back on. Other than the buttons I love the shirt."
4.0,"Super cute swimsuit! The pattern is adorable, looks just like the pic/description. Great coverage for your girls and bottom. I'm wearing a XXL/US 6/8, I'm 5'0 125lbs."
4.0,Very pretty when you wear. I receive  complements every time I wear this piece with my outfits for work. If you look at the piece closely you can tell the price. Great for the price.
4.0,"I'm a 38 double/triple D depending on brand, about 190 to 200 pounds. I got the 4XL. I was hesitant, but tired of wearing one pieces and body shaming myself. Honestly? Much better quality than expected. A nice lift for the boobs with a decent amount of room. I wasn't worried about falling out or anything. I have some thick thighs but luckily the bottom fits nicely. Showed a little peek of my booty cheeks but nothing major which I liked.<br /><br />The elastic in the bottoms does move around a bit inside the fabric which looks odd so look out for that. The top strap around the neck started hurting a bit after a while, not sure if because I wore it several days, tied too tight, or if it was the fabric, but thought I'd mention it.<br /><br />I ordered a size up just in case. If possible always measure yourself before buying, so you can get the suitable size for you. In my opinion, the size chart seems pretty accurate so that's good."
4.0,Cute and functional tote. I like the zipper and I love the print. It’s smaller than I thought but not too small to get the job done
4.0,"It looks good, but by the picture I thought it was gonna be more lose, and its just kinda tight."
4.0,Fits great. I wear a size 9. 34DDD and got a large. The fabric is really cheap. BUT it’s comfortable. And isn’t going to fall apart easily. Stitching is good. Cut and style is great. Flatters the body in all the right places. I wish they made it in cotton though.
4.0,Nice belt. I have at least five of these belts and they all work the same.
4.0,"From what I can gather, this is not a ""geniune"" Frye boot as it is made in Mexico and Frye boos are made in the US. For the price though, I think this is a great deal. The leather is definitely not as ""buttery soft"" as other Frye boots. But it is pretty decent. The boot looks exactly as shown and comes up about below midcalf. I have big calves and could never seem to find Frye boots that worked (even their wide calf ones). These were a little tight, but in just a couple uses, the calves loosened up.<br /><br />My biggest issue was the narrowness of the boot. I am by no means a ""wide footed"" person. I have never had issues with shoes being too narrow - mine have always been average. However, these were INSANELY narrow. They actually hurt my feet and made them numb after wearing for a long period of time. However, I was pretty determined to keep these since they are the exact style I wanted and again, cannot beat that price. After two weeks of wearing them around the house in socks on and off, they are NORMAL. :) YAY!"
4.0,Love the outfit! I took measurements and ordered according to the size chart. I usually wear a size 2 or 4 in dresses and my measurements went along with the size 6. I'm so happy I followed the size chart or it would have been too small. The only thing I was confused by was that the apron is not on an angle like the picture. It's straight accross. You have to tie it up differently if you want the angle. Other then that I'm 100% satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,"Very nice and seems like good quality.  However, it wasn't as full as I thought it would be according to the picture.  It's more of a fitted style than loose and flowing."
4.0,"I purchased 40 of these for the middle school science classes I teach.  These are perfect for this use.  Large lens and good magnification.  Some distortion around the edge, but what did you expect for this price? Of the 40 only 2 had minor defects (chips) in the lens, but they were still functional."
4.0,Very comfy and fit just right love the material
4.0,Figure flattering... definitely a win for the hourglass shape!
4.0,"This watch is lightweight and feels flimsy, but on your wrist it looks like a luxury item. It is elegant and comfortable. I get compliments when ever I wear it. It's good value for the cost."
4.0,"These aren't quite as thick as I had hoped, but they are nice. I hope they stay put."
4.0,Slides on and off easily. It’s a little tough to get it tight. Nice looking.<br /><br />Update… the buckle broke under normal use. I did not over tighten it.
4.0,"The dress is cute and fits bigger than I expected. I returned the large and got a small, which fits much better. The material wears a bit hot."
4.0,"The colors are a little bit on the flat side, but this fits well. Well Stitched and like the ruffled look."
4.0,Material is not what I expected but i like the fit somewhat
4.0,It’s comfortable. But it’s small. There’s no option to choose the length. If you have big wrists I don’t recommend buying it. I have small wrists and it’s small on me.
4.0,poor construction. beautiful bracelet. broke after 2 weeks
4.0,"I expected these to be more of a cat eye frame, but they are cute and I will keep them."
4.0,Hard to install. Lose s up but very nice for the price. Comfortable
4.0,My son ordered this product. So I assume hes happy with them
4.0,it's not of the HIGHEST quality but the interior is nice. I got it for nail manicure tools and such and it fits all my nail polish bottles in the bottom comfortably. Haven't used the lock since I don't need to but it has helped consolidate all my stuff in one place. Some compartments are small but overall fit what I need. Would recommend.
4.0,"It was shorter than expected, other than that it was perfect!"
4.0,These pants fit and feel great! Absolutely love them. I just ordered a second pair.
4.0,"Absolutely encourage going up a size or two.<br /><br />I fit the large, but went with XL. Everything fits really nicely, the jacket is a bit small on me but not unbearably small. Genuinely didn’t expect this to be good, but I’m so happy I got it.<br /><br />The dress is a soft material. The tie took me a minute to navigate (it’s a zip?). The ‘socks’ are thin material but still look (and feel) really good.<br /><br />Overall incredible quality (at least in my opinion) and blew my expectations."
4.0,My grand daughter loves them. A bit cheaper look than i expected but shes happy so im happy.
4.0,My son make this an alternate color band for his fitbit watch.  Nice
4.0,these pants are very good quality i need to size up because waist was a little tight for me specificleyI ordered anothe rcolor and just love them so adorable i am short so they come to my lower ankle just perfect.
4.0,It’s really fashion but it hurt the ears when you wear it for long time
4.0,Arrived on time and it's super comfy...and it has pockets :)
4.0,Very soft shirt- color is nice. A little tighter than I expected around the shirred part. Will be a good shirt for work.
4.0,"I love how it feels like I am at the beach, its so cute. would buy more some day. =)"
4.0,"These shoes are very cute. They're high, of course, but the platform helps stabilize them. The styling is great, except for the fact that they don't have a back. For some reason, I just do not walk well in shoes with ankle straps but no back. I always feel like my heels are flapping around. The real downside, though, is that they are narrow. I do have wide feet, so this may not be an issue for you, but they didn't work for me. Had to send them back, although doing so really disappointed me."
4.0,"Very nice, comfy !"
4.0,"Put thick socks on and only them till broke in. Fall or winter is the best time to buy and break in leather. Will work nice in spring and summer then. Would like to see a liner put in them. Can be a bitch to get ur foot in, but they gave me a shoe horn that helped. The toe looks like a cowboy boot but the color is good. Still new to me for now, will add later if I remember lol. But decent pair of boots so far (two and a half months)."
4.0,Very pretty but this should be classified as a wrap.  There are no arm holes or sleeves.
4.0,"I wear an XL but for this one I should have ordered an XXL because it’s right across the hips and stomach, where I carry the bulk of my weight."
4.0,"Very nice, looks great, and feels great too. I appreciate the support it gives."
4.0,These are so cute! Even my kids love them
4.0,This isa might go to piece love it just as promised
4.0,"The earrings itself is beautiful. However, it never stays in place as there is nothing to hold on to the ear lope.<br />It going back soon. Otherwise, it's a keeper."
4.0,"I didn't notice the Velcro across the back when I purchased them. This may be perfect for some, but it is not my style."
4.0,nice dress just not for me the print is very pretty
4.0,The package came sooner than expected. The item was well packaged and contained labels in case you want to return it. It looks durable..however I dont recommend it as a piece to wear all the time because the weight may irritate your hand. I would be wearing only when I am going out casually somewhere for some hours but I would not wear it whole day to work. All in all I am satisfied.
4.0,"This is a great sweatshirt, but there are a few problems with it. First off, it's very thin and doesn't really keep you warm. I live in NYC and decided to go out with it on, I nearly froze. Then, the red color is more vibrant than in the retail picture. Other than that, it's a great sweat shirt!"
4.0,Got these for my husband and they fit him great. He is 5.4 and 140lbs and normally wears a 30/30 pant and the small fits him great.  He gets hot easily when he is sleeping and these are not too heavy so they work out well.  It was a great purchase.
4.0,"Nice dress, perfect for the summer"
4.0,"These are OK, not made for high intensity exercising (*if you are a bit top heavy) but these are great to wear for walking, weight training, floor exercises etc."
4.0,"Like: Heavier material than others I have ordered!<br />Dislike: It was advertised as large, but really isn’t that large! Barely fit to keep over the nose and under the chin!"
4.0,"Okay so, it came in early and got here fast and was well treated in receiving of the package, I hand mo issues at all with anything, simple ordered it then got it a week or so later. I'm 5'4"" about 107 lbs and I got a small, and it fits well other than the shorts are a little shorter than I am used to(I typically dont wear shorts ever lmao) so if you want them to go past a little above mid thigh then get a medium uniform if that's what you are and are around my height :))) it's a lovely uniform came in greatly packaged and doesnt feel weird on my skin or anything, great product. I would see myself ordering from this company again for future cosplays I look forward to doing and or have my friends check it out as well. Other than the shorts being a smidge shorter than anticipated I love it though"
4.0,Very pretty color but very big!
4.0,Cute laces!
4.0,"This is a great product, it's a lot smaller than I expected.  I'm notorious for ordering things that are smaller than they appear in real life =).  You get a letter of authenticity along with it.  It is a beautiful color and is about 1.5 - 2 inches (not sure if they vary in size)."
4.0,Love this scarf! I thought it would be a little bigger but it's still big
4.0,"This purse IS small, but will work if you get rid of the junk in your purse. The strap adjusts to either hand carry or shoulder bag. Nice appearance."
4.0,The sizes aren't even close. XL should order 3X. Must be Asian sizes. It is very soft and warm. Other than having to order a bigger size it's really nice and very comfortable.
4.0,"I'm a Large/XL and ordered the 2xl and it's a little big. I love the color, it's a rich blue. The satin is a little stiff but I washed it with fabric softener and it softened some. It does look sexy on."
4.0,"I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I must admit it was a little smaller than I originally thought, but still beautiful and still gets the job done. The middle compartment can be used as a separate travel box, which I like. Comes with a key to lock. Overall nice product."
4.0,"Love the dress, thin wore a body suit under but lovely"
4.0,"*Received at a discount in exchange for my honest review*<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE every piece I've been fortunate enough to review from this seller.  My skin is apt to turn green super easily with costume jewelry, even silver plate doesn't last long with me.  But this company is the real deal: I've showered, gone into the pool, and sweated in their jewelry with absolutely NO reaction.  Heck, even their earring backs are sterling silver.  Plus each item comes in a jewelry box with an included polishing cloth.  I also love how dainty and girly each piece feels.<br /><br />I will comment that I normally prefer my anklets a little less dainty for running around.  This one is really pretty, though.  I like the design, especially, since every other one of the little round beads is free floating, as well as the heart charm.  It's innovative and creative, and I love it!  The bracelet is adjustable as well, and will fit a pretty universal collection on people. I have an average size ankle, and it fit me with room to spare.<br /><br />Overall, really happy with these, and will be wearing this any time I get dressed up!"
4.0,Product is as described and is a good wrap for exercise. It can be even better if the material  can be stronger so that it can be tighter to provide more support.
4.0,Beautiful workmanship.  Measure carefully when judging size of stones...appear smaller than 3mm by measurement.  The comfort plastic backs are great.
4.0,"I really like the look of the watch and it does have a light. The only thing is that the band is a little hard to clasp, but other than that I really like it especially for $20.00."
4.0,"Son loves it! Characters coloring is darker than pictured, but my son could care less."
4.0,"Good, very good."
4.0,Very light and flowy. Needs longer sleeves and some more allowance on chest area.<br />Great summer dress.
4.0,"It is truly beautiful and I bought a few of them.  Everyone that I gave one to loved it, however, 2 of the 5 that I bought didn't close properly.  They popped opened properly when you pushed the button, but then you had to push the button again to get the the clasp to close.  Overall, I love the product.  The chain is nice, it seems of good quality, just slight issue with the clasp on the pocket watch part."
4.0,"I love them but one pair had mold on it. But I'm just going wash them and see what happens. I love the other 2 and don't want to have to return all 3 for 1. I'm 5'9"" and love finding long socks that I can wear. We will see what happened or I'll try returning just the one pair of they allow it 🤷"
4.0,"Wife loved this for mothers day. We're big Dr. Who fans, and setting this up with a picture of our newborn daughter and myself made it a perfect gift.<br /><br />But keep in mind, unlike the TARDIS from the show, it's not bigger on the inside. It was a bit of a task to get the pictures in place."
4.0,Es mi primer money clip y me gusta cabe lo necesario
4.0,I like this dress.  It will be great for fall- note you HAVE to wear something under it because the slit is super high in the front skirt and low in the front chest area
4.0,Runs a little small but very sexy. The strings are very long and you have to lace the pants up. The material is like a faux suade.
4.0,It was a little smaller than was expected. Lost a couple of pounds around the waste then it fit perfectly.
4.0,"Very comfortable. The buttons are very high quality. But the dress is short. I am only 5'2&#34; (~158cm), and the dress falls to just above my ankles. When I iron it I'm able to stretch it out a bit but ultimately I will have to add fabric to lengthen it to make this dress more comfortable to wear."
4.0,"At first I wasnt sure if this would look good on me. According to my husband and my sister in law, I look hot! It is just the right length for my 5'4 height! It feels great. The only downside is that there are seams on the right upper thigh area that the seams are separating. Before I even put it on :/  So I have to fix that before I can wear it out of the house.<br /><br />The belt that comes with it is bendable, so I bent it to fit around my frame more. So it no longer sticks out on the sides.<br />The fabric is very light and feels good against my skin.<br />I really like the design. The width of the legs is not too wide for me.<br />I may exchange it for a pair that is sewn completely.<br /><br />I purchased this outfit at a discount and this is my honest review ."
4.0,Pretty! Looks way more valuable than what it cost
4.0,I love the dress but the color was a lot lighter than what the picture showed.
4.0,"Good strap but the colour is a liitle too yellow to really be called khaki. I'll maybe tone it down by wiping it with a sponge wetted with black coffee. As is typical of sailcloth straps, it has a nice sheen to it and the threads in this particular weave are finer than usual, which results in an even silkier appearance than you normally get from sailcloth.<br /><br />For some reason, sailcloth straps are always tailored, if I can use that word, meaning they're tapered like a watch strap should be and that's why I dumped the nylon-weave strap I had on the watch in favour of this one, because natos, perlons & other woven straps are straight all the way to the buckle, which I don't like.<br /><br />The watch I bought it for is a black Casio pure analogue with a beige/khaki dial. It's a diver and the black bezel has gold markers. Unusual, good-looking and I think now sold out. When I saw this strap comes with a black-buckle option, I was all in. Something I didn't notice in the listing photo is the black vinyl underlayer that touches the wrist, a nice colour-coordination thang. And it's semi-matte so it doesn't let the strap slide around so your watch is hanging off the outside edge of your wrist.<br /><br />All sailcloth straps are stiff at the beginning and so is this one. I switch around between a number of watches and it'll take a while for this one to get enough wear to soften up, but that doesn't bother me. What I like is that I have a tapered strap, colour-matched to the two colours of the Casio, and with that special reflective characteristic that makes a nearly indestructible strap look elegant at the same time."
4.0,I had to try three different sizes before I found the correct size.  The third try was the charm!
4.0,Fit nicely and work good
4.0,Great quality with the exception of the dangly circles that hold the feather and talon charms. They don't make perfect circles and seem to be the most liable part to break. Other than that it is beautiful.
4.0,"Anticipated them being sized small, per previous reviews and wanted them to fit for whole school year, we ordered up 2 sizes and they fit her perfectly with some room."
4.0,"Good product<br /><br />Good Color<br />Good Materials<br />The item is like as the photos<br />Good Quality<br /><br />it's  good, I recommend it"
4.0,"I ordered these to use in wedding decoration (weird, huh?). I really liked the convenience and price, since making throwies would have been extremely time consuming and only a little less expensive. We had quite a few DOA or otherwise unusable ones (the switch didn't work properly in some). Guests at the wedding definitely had fun with them, and my niece was crazy about the leftovers. Overall I would say they would make great favors or even useful little lights to keep in the car or some other handy spot."
4.0,Good value for price. Comfortable and warm.
4.0,"So my daughter is thrilled with the look of these boots, and they'll do for what we need, but be aware that they aren't super high quality. I'm not certain how long they'll last.<br /><br />I actually waterproofed them after reading other reviews, so I hope that will help keep her feet dry. They look like they'll do decently, but we'll see. With some kids, getting them to wear boots is half the battle, however, and the fact that these are pink and sparkly made them an instant it."
4.0,"I ordered this dress in black with the red trim. I love that the dress is made from a slightly stretchy fabric. It enables me to slip this dress on without even having to mess with the zipper. The skirt is flattering but definitely requires ironing before wearing, even after a good wash and dry. The dress fits exactly as I expected based on the size chart, and it is important to note that the size chart doesn't accurately sync up with the American sizes listed above measurements. I'd estimate it's a full size down from what's listed. I ordered the XXL and it fits more like a 14/16 than a 16/18. The bow is really cute without being little girlish and I love that it's a sewn on to the front of the dress instead of attached to a belt. The lack of a belt really highlights the dress's flattering, slimming waist. The only thing I really dislike about the dress is that the red lining at the neckline makes the neck turn inward, which both hides the red trim and lowers the neckline, exposing more chest skin.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Had leg injury and kept swelling down.
4.0,great driving glasses
4.0,Worth it! Love them
4.0,"This was bigger than I expected, after wrapping it twice around my neck it still felt big....otherwise happy with the purchase."
4.0,Cheep red shirt. Good for the price!
4.0,I love these socks for cold weather and specifically for snowboarding. They are thick so need some room in boots to wear them but definitely will keep you warm and are very comfortable.
4.0,"It should work fine for traveling. Holds quite a few travel bottles or regular size shampoo, conditioner."
4.0,really have not used it much but its good so far
4.0,"I wear a medium the medium fit well. I’m 5’4 ,36c/28/39 138lbs. 4 stars for the heavier material and the tan buttons stick out a lot against the black fabric. May change out. Also be aware the crochet chest area is see thru so any bra will show through."
4.0,"I wear a size 9.5 and have wide feet.  These come in whole sizes only, so I ordered a size 10.  They fit well and suprisingly accomidate wide feet nicely.  They feel closer to a standard 10.5W.  I wear wool socks when outdoors and there is still a little bit of space.<br /><br />They look attractive.  All points are professinally done.  No stray threads or imperfections.  I do appreciate the layered design elements - I think it will help them age gracefully (I have other boots in a similar style, and the toes are the first things to wear through - this design will prevent that).<br /><br />Build quality is firm, but nice.  The soles are a bit hard, but have good traction.  The material is firm.  They'll take a little bit to break in, but aren't uncomfortable.  The soles doen't have much padding and are a bit hard.  There is minor padding at the heel, but not much at the balls of your feet.<br /><br />They are a bit heavy. I don't think I'd want to be walking around all day in them. I certainly won't be doing ""sports"" type stuff with them.<br /><br />I'll use them for fall/winter casual walking and yard work.  The weight and hardness means I'm unlikely to use them on hiking or running.  Not being waterproof means I'll have limited winter/snow use (casual shoveling or trips outside are great).  They have good traction and a solid design.<br /><br />These are great casual winter and fall workboots."
4.0,Bit larger then I had expected but still love it
4.0,"The jacket is very warm. I ordered a 2x after reading the reviews. It does run a bit small, but the 2x fits well."
4.0,"The design is really cute. My two concerns are that the posts are extremely long-especially for a child who will typically wear these. They are longer than any pair of post earrings I own. Second is the shipping bag was flat, providing no protection to the posts, and both were significantly bent! I had to use needle nose pliers to straighten them, and it was totally due to poor shipping packaging."
4.0,"I’m a big Carhartt fan, so this was an easy purchase to make. For the size of the bag, however, I’d say it’s a little over-priced."
4.0,"Comfortable,  fits perfectly.  I don't typically wear a one piece swimsuit because they never fit in more than one area of my body. If this was a swimsuit, I would be converted."
4.0,cute for everyday
4.0,"The gloves are good. The quality is good for the price. I'm 5/2 a little bit long for me, sometimes they go down, but they look so nice"
4.0,"Really cute, fitted shirt but too short for my personal taste so I returned it. It hit right at the top of my hips and I prefer a longer length. I don't think ordering a size up would have improved the fit for me. For reference I ordered a medium and am 5'4"" and currently 158 lbs with a 32I bra size."
4.0,I like it thinking about purchasing another one in blue or purple
4.0,"I really like that it's affordable and eclectic, but they break rather quickly if I'm not careful.<br />I have recommended this to plenty of customers that come into the store I work at."
4.0,"I'm a little on the heavy side and I stand at 5'9. I ordered the dress in a 3x based on other reviews. When I pulled it out of the package, I was a little on the skeptical side because of how it looked but when I tried it on, I felt a little better about it. It fit a little snug on my stomach but hugged every other curve the right way. I'm very pleased with it"
4.0,"It is made out of fairly thin material, which I didn't know what to expect. I've worn it out to dinner and I wear it around the house. I would have given if an extra star if it were cheaper."
4.0,"Love this ring, but the sizes are off a little. Ordered 9 just a little small"
4.0,"I got this wallet recently, and it's almost exactly what I want in a wallet. The easy access pocket is great for my driver's license, and the magnet under the keyring helps hold things there. The 2 problems I had were that the pockets were incredibly tight at first, and I had to soften them with a blow dryer. Second, after putting some gift cards in the wallet, the strips stopped working, requiring them to be typed in manually, and I believe it may have been due to the magnets. If you do get it, keep your important cards opposite the magnets."
4.0,"I have large breast and these do not! support my breast, because they are very small. I have to use another bra over this,ah well, atleast its cute. The sellers were very helpful and honest, the bra is also very well constructed I appreciate that. Would buy again"
4.0,Medium is kinda small and large is too big but the color is awesome!!
4.0,Beautiful skirt didn't fit in the waist
4.0,If you have a small face these might not be for you. The style is super Over size however the quality is really good.
4.0,"I like the black, but the blue is more dark than what it looks like in the picture. It kind of blends in with the black bands and can't see the pretty blue setting..."
4.0,Very nice dress but runs small. Look at the size chart before ordering. I will purchase other dresses from this company.
4.0,"I like that the material of this hoodie is lightweight, super soft, and cozy. I sized up to an XL for a baggy fit, and the hoodie fits as expected. The metal zipper pulls smoothly. The pockets are a generous size and can fit a phone. I found the colors to be more muted in real life. The edges of the fabric on the hoodie are unfinished. Overall, this is a soft and cozy hoodie for cooler days."
4.0,Very nice piece of clothing. The quality was 4 stars. It would have been five but there was some lose stitching. But overall a good quality. I received it faster then the expected date. It also fit my significant other quite well. She was very satisfied with the lingerie. And I was happy I paid a fraction of what the main stores selling them for. So it worked for both of us. Sorry I can't post pics. Lol. For the price you can not go wrong. Save yourself some money and have a good time.
4.0,It is not as detailed as the pictures in ad but it is still a pretty ring for the price you pay I would buy again
4.0,"Like that the mask retains it's shape after washing, easy to breathe and does not fog up my glasses."
4.0,"We purchased these to use as party favors for my 11 year old’s birthday party. The girls all loved them. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that they get kinks in the chain easily, but again they all loved them."
4.0,"Bought a size I thought would be quite large (for growth, planned for use next year too) but the sizing runs small compared to regular shoes. Super cute though! Grandson, age 2 1/2, is having to learn to walk in them, they're a little stiff or slippery I guess."
4.0,I only wish these came in a glossy frame. Otherwise for $12 you can't go wrong. Frame is big but not extremely oversized for my 7 1/2 inch head (hat size).<br /><br /> Are they durable ? Most glasses aren't that durable but if you keep them in a hard case and treat them well they will last longer. If you take them off with one hand or leave them out of their case something will eventually happen to them...your  choice.<br /><br /> If you like this style and have a 7 1/2 inch hat size or smaller these will work for you.
4.0,"It's beautiful and comfortable, yet a little I could have worn a smaller size."
4.0,Recipient was delighted. Glad I didn't get gold plated.
4.0,Normally between an xs and small. Small fit great. Worth it for the price!
4.0,"They were supposed to be gray, they are blue ish<br />I’ll keep them and wear them with something else"
4.0,"Not the greatest shoes, but for the money they are good, do not make the same mistake as me. I adjusted the cleats and was going to readjust them later and they were too loose and my shoe got stuck to the pedal and half tore up my shoe."
4.0,Solid belt for use with casual dress slacks.  Happy with this purchase.
4.0,Two of the bags came unglued on the side seam while I opened them :( but I was able to use elmer's glue to fix it. Minor hiccup. Not that big of a deal.
4.0,I love this coat it is extremely lightweight but keeps me warm no matter how cold or windy it is and I love the colors only complaint is the hood
4.0,"I bought this in 2012, and it took me five years to finally kill it.<br /><br />It's light and thin, but stands up to quite a lot of abuse -- this wallet has been washed, dried, dropped, run over by bikes and cars, stepped on, washed and dried some more, rained on, and cheerfully survived it all.<br /><br />I've been pleasantly surprised from the word go at how well cards stay put -- which is great, since normally this thing holds my bank card, ID, the credit card I carry for day-to-day expenses (and pay off every month), insurance cards, ballet class cards, appointment reminder cards, coffee-shop punch-cards, business cards, calling cards, and all the other cards that seem to sneak in there.  Every now and then, while cleaning it out, I'm pretty much stunned by how much I've managed to cram in there.<br /><br />My sole complaint is that the main opening is just a hair narrow, so while it's much quicker to use with cash that a card-holder style wallet, it's still a little more fiddly than a full-size bifold.  It's also a little shallower than the width of many receipt papers, which is a bit of a pain if your better half (wisely) likes you to bring home all your receipts in readable condition.<br /><br />That said, I'm willing to accept those trade-offs in exchange for the light weight, extreme durability, and lean profile this wallet offers. I travel by bike and foot just about everywhere I go, so every gram (and millimeter) counts.<br /><br />Oh, I should mention that it looks pretty nice, too -- not quite as sharp, of course, as the traditional leather bi-fold, but sufficiently restrained and conservative for just about any setting.<br /><br />In short, you can do a heck of a lot worse than this wallet.  It's a good choice for active folks, especially users of active transit."
4.0,"Very cute. They seem a little long, but work fine."
4.0,Will definitely need to shorten (I’m 5’4”). Fits everywhere else even my DDD s which are usually a problem. I’m deciding if I should use fusable hem or cut and try to sew it. The knot material may run or pucker
4.0,"Have mixed emotions about these pants. They're the best looking sweat pants that I  own. However, the fit is just weird. Even though I purchased a large after reading review's that said they run true to size. At 5'11"" with a 32in waist I didn't want them baggy but the waist fit (barely) but they are really short.  Someone claimed to be 6'2 and said a large was perfect. Unless they wanted them to stop just below the knee there is no way they were perfect.  Good quality, awesome design, strange sizing. Hope you found this useful."
4.0,"the lock is a little wiggly, the band runs small. fits my wrist perfectly. but it is very pretty and doesn't turn my skin green. I have worn it everyday sense i bought it, only taking it off for the shower."
4.0,"Está bonito pero no fué el que pedí de happy Anniversary, me enviaron el que dice for ever, y mucho más pequeño de lo que esperaba"
4.0,"The earrings seem well constructed and the ""stones"" pretty but I believe simulated"
4.0,It's very pretty and I got a great price on it. The picture made it  look  silver and  it would have perfectly matched a premier design necklace that I have if it were. It is a gold tone though or I would have given it the 5 stars.
4.0,Very good jacket a little thinner material than I had expected. Could only imagine it wouldn't take much to tear a hole.
4.0,"This dress was very stretchy. I am 5""2 and 168 and I ordered a LG. It fit great. I got a lot of compliments."
4.0,Nice earrings!!
4.0,"I returned these for the next size down. I normally wear a 71/2 to an 8... The 7 fits perfectly and is still wide enough for my bunion. I am used to wearing sandals with arch support so I could wear them all day form the start. I think these are the best so far, and I have tried a lot of different brands. I have a neuroma and plantar fasciitis....Love these!"
4.0,very comftable I would have orderd 1 size smaller but still very usable
4.0,"Stylish shirt and looks good on me in the blue color, like the fact that it is collarless and is light weight. The only problem I have is that the sleeves are too short on me, but I can always roll them up."
4.0,"Such beautiful detail on such a tiny little surface.  I am having a small issue with the clasp not staying closed, here the 4 starts instead of 5"
4.0,"This band has been a wonderful upgrade from the rubber stock Garmin Forerunner 945 band. Its comfortable, dries quickly, doesn't slip, and requires no adjustment once fitted (if you're like me who's wrist slightly swell during endurance activity). The steal clips will catch your arm hair if you find yourself sliding your watch on your wrist. My only issue was needing to buy the right tools to remove my old band... YouTube was a great resource."
4.0,Cute band and doesn’t make my arm sweat.
4.0,"Other reviews about minor irregularities were accurate, but it's not enough to skip this beauty. Heavy for it's price and looks beautiful with a &#34;V&#34; necklace or sweater.  I'm pleased with my purchase."
4.0,"It fit well and is comfortable, or so the person who received it said.  They really liked the gift."
4.0,"Great looking bracelet, stones good color, not as dark as I like, but nice nonetheless.  I have some concerns about the locking clasp as I like two safety catches instread of one.  All in all a very nice breaclet and I will wear it a lot!"
4.0,"Very nice scarf, pockets are bigger than I thought, but not good for heavy things like phones etc,"
4.0,"Actually better than expected. It allows you to try out different sizes to see what feels/looks best for you. I did have one black rubber part pop off during sleep, but other than that no issues. Looks great, feels great."
4.0,I wanted to love this top but it is too small  even though I ordered a size up. so I am returning it. It fits but I prefer my tops be loose and not form fitting.
4.0,"Kind of a weird fit at the shoulders, depending on the shirt underneath. Length is great. Comfortable enough for a lightweight cardigan. Makes an outfit look a little more pulled together. One of my favorite pieces."
4.0,"Very white. A little different then the pics. Not stretchy at all, and a bit tight in the chest, but it'll be fine. Can't complain for the price."
4.0,"Love the shirt. When I received the shirt it was a little too big so I emailed to exchange. They would not exchange, so I was a little bummed about that. I got the shirt with a coupon code. They said I would have return and pay full price instead of exchanging for correct size. Other than that I liked the product."
4.0,Loved the sweater  just a bit more snug than my other mediums
4.0,"Beautiful color and nice fabric for traveling.  A little tight on top, but I'll make do!"
4.0,nice quality runs very small
4.0,Great price… They’re cute little earrings
4.0,"I like the hoodie but the sleeves are real big.I thought about sending it back,but I was afraid the next size down wood be to small are the waist."
4.0,"For the exceptionally low price I found the 4 textured mock neck long sleeve tops to be outstanding value. The fit, fabric and colors were very good.<br />Linda Robinson"
4.0,"The built in shorts are quite short, I would have liked them longer. It would make a great swim skirt"
4.0,"Works great, my coworkers hate it but they're just jealous cause they don't have one. Only drawback is the voice sounds like a southern hick is saying ""Yeeeeet"". I would give 5 stars if the voice matched the sophistication of this wonderful word"
4.0,"Adorable costume, well made and true to size. I gave it 4 stars because the buttons feel off the first day she wore it. They were easy to stick back into place but it was an inconvenience."
4.0,"This is a great loose fitting dress. Living in Arizona, I need clothing that looks great and keeps me cool.<br />The fabric is heavier than I expected and tends to be clingy. I ran a fabric sheet over it and eliminated the static. For the price it's a good buy."
4.0,Good gloves!!!
4.0,Runs a little short but fits all my curves nicely and very sexy
4.0,Material no es el mismo que indica
4.0,"This is a fun inflatable suit. Similar to others, there is a fan that you install into the suit and a battery pack that you plug into. You will need assistance getting in and out of this suit because of the zipper. You do have use of your hands in this suit, which is a plus compared to some others.<br /><br />This inflates fairly quickly and holds the air well. Your range of motion and field of view is limited, but you are a walking coffee cup, so that is to be expected. Due to the limited field of view, I recommend having a spotter that can keep and an eye out for trip/fall hazards or things that are in your peripheral."
4.0,"So soft and silky, I'm not sure how to style it, but I can't send it back..."
4.0,A little on the heavier side but fabulous color!
4.0,"One is shaped a little weird where the stud attaches to the pearl making the stud a little off kilter.  Other than that, love these earrings.  They are super comfortable."
4.0,Ok fabric and color. The shape is way off as they are tight through the thigh and knee and then baggy as anything from the calf to the ankle
4.0,"While I loved the design, the bracelet seemed a little small.  Gave as gifts and they were received with high praise"
4.0,"I’m 5’2” and usually wear a 12-14. Fit was great and it washed/dried very nicely.  Got lots of complements and the color was very pretty! It’s a bit long, but I sew and adjust all my clothes myself.  Perfect if you are taller than 5’2”"
4.0,Really cute. Perfect for many outfits because of the neutral color
4.0,nice product ships fast
4.0,"I liked the shoes, no complaints they was just to wide and to big."
4.0,Only issue is the brightness of the hands in the dark. Otherwise I love the watch.
4.0,This beanie type hat is soft and well made. I ordered it to go along with a fluffy white scarf in hopes that it would match okay. The hat is threaded with a sparkly gray material so it gave the pale fabric a bit of a grayer look overall. I do like the sparkle and the hat is nice and thick for warmth. This is definitely a winter staple!
4.0,Hat is good quality.  I like the rugged style. I do wish the cutout was a bit higher and maybe longer but it may loosen up after wearing. I’d recommend.
4.0,Okay I guess but a tad small so I say order a size up
4.0,"Cute and comfortable!  I wore it with cowgirl boots for my best friend's bachelorette party and had a great time. I tried putting a belt with it, but that made it too short for my comfort."
4.0,"This is a fun hat for clubbing, etc, but not really well made. I don't think it will last long."
4.0,I bought these for around the house. They don't look perfect on but they hit the soft an comfy mark perfectly
4.0,This dress/blouse is beautiful.  Great material.  A little snug on the shoulders but will make it work.
4.0,"Compact, but all my stuff fits in it."
4.0,Cute but pretty short in front and has bulky material inside of the front pocket pouch. I loved the color and material though.
4.0,"I can't complain too much - I wore them almost daily for 18 months.  Was disappointed that the stone fell out, but the company only has a 30 day return policy and were unable to process a refund or replacement."
4.0,It more coral/salmon than pink
4.0,They are too big for us yet but they look pretty nice. The shoes shipped in a box and came in perfect condition. I like that the shoe laces are phone so no need to tie them.
4.0,"Very nice, but a little small."
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): The blue color of this sweater is so pretty.  I love the ribbed fabric - it is reasonably thick, soft and stretchy.  The neckline is fun and interesting.  The shape is feminine and flattering.  However, the sweater runs really small.  I would recommend at least going up one size, if not two."
4.0,"First off this watch is a flat out beautiful sports/casual watch. The deep blue face is gorgeous, the case design is clean and classy, and it keeps great time. The downside is that it has really-really dim lume for a Seiko and as a result I don't wear it much and then only during the day (minus 1 star). At bedtime I strap on one of my Citizen casual/sport watches or one of my Seiko or Orient dive watches before bed."
4.0,Cool hoodie. Definitely runs small. If you're between two sizes definitely go to the higher size.
4.0,"Super cute and stylish retro look. Dress it up with a pencil skirt or down with jeans. Runs small. I’m a size 8 with 36DD and the XL is perfect, if not a touch snug across the bust. Still, definitely a keeper!"
4.0,Gift recipient loved
4.0,"I like the dreamy design and fabric of the dress very much. I bought size S and it is a little large for me, but decided to keep it anyway."
4.0,"I liked it for the most part, but I had to keep adjusting it while at the ceremony which was annoying."
4.0,"I bought this watch on ebay, it was a refurbished unit that was in my case perfectly new.<br /><br />With that said, I have a similar comment to others with regard to the band... I did want a leather band, and this is indeed leather but the finish on it makes it look as if it were plastic.<br /><br />The two free loop ring it's a part that I do particularly dislike the most.....<br />I can't point my finger in a particular reason, I do have a seiko with leather band and although 22mm as well, almost same padding as this one, and smaller on the buckle looks nicer....<br /><br />The one with the mesh band has similar remarks... of course always open to personal taste.<br />I didn't find any comment like this for the Alpha....<br /><br />Regarding the watch I do like it... the dial it's simple, maybe way to simple (something that I did also like, and a reason for buying it).<br />The form and combination of polish and satin it's also nice, the circle based form with edges it's also a detail that I do like a lot.<br /><br />With that said I might probably switch later the band for a black leather one or a nato...<br /><br />Edit:<br />I used shoe black color shine on the strap, now it's almost black with blue accents depending on light, that does also take away the light blue stitches.... I do like way more the look of it now.<br />Would update to 4.5 stars if available."
4.0,"Overall very comfortable, love the pockets. I got a large but could have had a better fit if it were medium. The length is good, but the waist was about 2 inches wider than expected."
4.0,"The quarantine weight gain was not kind to my waistline, so these are my sort of solution to support my workouts and diet change. I have no interest in a tight tummy wrap, but shorts that help me sweat? Yes. These look like biker shorts, which I’m a fan of.<br /><br />Pros:<br />They pull on easy, clipping in in this size was a little harder for me. I have XXL too and they’re too big. Guess I need to lose ;)<br />They do make you sweat! Like a gross amount. Pulling them off after even a 30 min workout is like changing out of a wetsuit.<br />The sweat stays contained!! - this is key.<br />They’re a great length! I wore mine with a workout tee and looked very on trend.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Size chart is more difficult than I thought<br />The crotch is not sewn in a great way for someone working out. I don’t think this size will last long for me if I do squats or lunges. They need a triangle stretch patch.<br />The thighs are a bit see through on me."
4.0,"Really nice fabrics, warm and wind resistant. A comfort on a chilly day. Size 36 ffits my 37 inch measured waist well, fit is almost sloppy big though in the thigh and legs and rise. Still worth wearing for the warmth."
4.0,Got this for my kids bonus mom we dont like the term stepmom so.love the bonus mom havent given it to her yet but i know she will love it
4.0,Comfortable cushiony.
4.0,NICER THAN I EXPECTED ! THESE CAN EASILY BE WORN FOR CASUAL OR DRESS . I LOVE THESE EARRINGS.
4.0,The eye holes are a little small for a man.
4.0,"The dress was pretty, but the I really needed it shorter and the eyelet bottom could not be hemmed."
4.0,Nice looking shirt.  Just received as Christmas gift. So far so good.
4.0,cute but the shirt is semi tighter than the shorts .I weight 153 at 5'5'' .
4.0,granddaughter loves the patterns and style of these socks  they seem to wash well and she will only wear these out of all her socks  shipped fast too
4.0,"I like this bag well enough. It's a good size, and it's really cute...but the lining is just okay. I personally like to have a lot of pockets and organization in my bags, but this purse is kind of lacking in terms of pockets. Also, one of my pockets is already starting to separate from the lining. I'm going to make an insert, so I'm not too bothered. I don't regret the purchase at all - despite its shortcomings, I do recommend the bag!"
4.0,I know it says kids apron but this is so small the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is made well and I just attach a similar piece of material to the bottom
4.0,"good, like it."
4.0,"Comfy glasses. I haven't tried changing the lenses - I only use the polarized ones. The strap broke after a couple uses - not a huge problem, but a little annoying. The cases in itself is great."
4.0,I liked the workout top it was just too large. I'm 5'5 and weigh 115. I'm a 34DD. I hope this helps people when ordering.
4.0,I like my hat. Thank you.
4.0,"Cute top, but very thing cheap material. Get what you pay for, but still worth it to me."
4.0,"I have been wearing a gold tone silicone wedding ring for a couple of years now and love it. I do handyman work and have been fearful of getting my ring caught or mashed on my finger. I've been married over 22 years and my ring finger has gone from a size 10 to size 13! I had to have my old ring cut off and resized. Even after resizing it left a dent in my finger. Not anymore. I will always prefer my actual gold band because of the sentiments behind it. But I am having a hard time taking these off. These are a little bit bigger and beefier than the silicone band I had been wearing for the last couple of years. It slipped off my finger and I couldn't find it so I ordered these. The whole package cost less than half of the price for original one I bought and it was only a 2-pack. I did end up finding the one I lost but I'm not putting it back on. I like these better. Nice variety too. Am wearing the traditional gold but just might experiment a little with the different looks. Having just received these I have no idea how well they will hold up or for how long, but they do seem to be even higher quality than the one I had been wearing. Even if it only makes it a year, at this price I wouldn't be upset at all. I've got nine more replacements!<br />UPDATE: I have been wearing only the Gold band since I ordered these rings a couple of weeks ago. Apparently the &#34;metal&#34; sparkly look is only a coating of some kind and not impregnated in the silicone as it is starting to come off and parts of the ring are yellow. It's not a huge deal but the other ring I had misplaced still has its &#34;gold&#34; look. I'm still relatively pleased with the set of rings considering all the others I can still wear besides the gold one. I took off one star due to the appearance changing. I also read another review that the same thing happened to the silver ring for another purchaser. Yes, I'd buy again, but I'd also look around a little more before I click the buy button."
4.0,Great sweater but sheds some.
4.0,"Just wanted to re-confirm what the top reviewer has said. I bought the 3 pack with grey, blue, and black and the grey and blue ones feel alot thinner and stretched a bit after the first wash. The black one is alot more better material (I dont want to necessarily say thicker but better material for sure) I ordered another set of 3 blacks so looking forward to that.<br /><br />2 things I should mention are the tags and stitching are awkward. On the side stitching I could feel it almost to the point it itched a bit, this seemed to change after a while (I may have gotten used to it or wash or 2 helped). So be ready for that. The second thing is there is a tag imbedded into the inner side of the side stitch. You need to cut this almost expertly because pulling it will break the seams. I used a nail clipper to clip away at the tag threading without damaging it. Sort of annoying that I had to do that but they arent so bad for my gym use."
4.0,"Very nicely assembled. My only problem was the bow tie. I was able to tighten it up to fit my son, so it did sag but other than that, good product"
4.0,"Posted by my wife. I liked this a lot but the top part just didn't fit well. The cups are spaced very wide apart and there was really no way to &#34;take in&#34; that part of the suit. If there had been a way to take it in I would of and kept the suit. Too bad, it had to go back."
4.0,I got this to wear as a choker but it doesn't tighten enough so it's just a short necklace on me. But the pendant is really cute and I still can't wait to wear it around. Worth the amount I spent on it.
4.0,"These are great Jambu shoes and at a great deal!  The shipping was quick.  I bought a couple of different shoes and they were shipped together.  The Jambu Capri are a little snug - you really need to go a half size larger than normal.  They still work, though, and feel great!"
4.0,Wig wasn't 33&#34; long like in the description but it will work for what I need it for.
4.0,Runs half size up. Big boobs girl
4.0,Best drawstring bag I've had ever! Easy to close/open...material feels durable...great size.<br />Will be buying more for my team.
4.0,"The shirts are of good quality and great fit, my only problem was that is says for &#34;Boys&#34; and the photo has a boy model- but there is a sewn on patch at the bottom of each shirt with a girly quote of: &#34;I don't chase boys, I run past them&#34;. I was able to unstitch the patches with a razor blade, so all is well. I will be purchasing more colors because the quality is good and the price is great considering the prices of other boys V-neck toddler shirts (which are hard to find!) I will just be unstitching all the patches."
4.0,"Good quality and fit. This is a simple dress that looks fashionable without breaking the bank. It came in an envelope inside of a plastic bag so it had a bit of smell, but it was easy to wash (machine washable) and dry."
4.0,"As of yet, I don't know what could be better. Durability can't be realized until time has past."
4.0,They are super cute. It's sucks there isn't a size 9.5 to accommodate for the short size 9. I am a true 9 in all of my shoes. This shoe is short a full 9.
4.0,nice product for the money spent.
4.0,The color isn't quite as bright as I wanted it to be but overall I'm happy.  It fits well and dresses up my watch for an evening out.
4.0,Dress runs small so SIZE UP one size. It also was a little too long. Comfy dress though.
4.0,"This is a very unusual ring, but it has a great deal of eye-appeal.  The opals catch the light and seem to move as you move your hand.  The black metal sets off the blue in a very dramatic fashion.  Younger women especially will like this one, I think, but I'm 60 and I love it, too.  It has no prongs and the stones are channel set so the surface is completely smooth.  You would be able to wear this in most situations without a problem...gardening, washing dishes, heavy housework, and in most workplaces, too.  If you can wear a wedding ring in a given situation, you should be able to wear this also.<br /><br />I tend to get dark marks from metals other than noble metals, and so far there's been no skin discoloration.  I know many of you are far more sensitive than that, and nearly everything turns you green, so you're likely to have a different result.  But it's fine on my skin.  It's a comfortable, practical ring, a nice substitute for a traditional wedding band, and an inexpensive one, too.  So if you're getting married on a tight budget...consider this until you can get the ring you really want.  This is nice for men, too, so you could have matching rings if you like.<br /><br />All in all it's a fun ring, unusual, comfortable, and inexpensive.  If you have all the basics and are looking to expand your jewelry wardrobe, this might be a good place to start!"
4.0,"Arrived in a pretty pink box and the detail is amazing. I still have it, but unfortunately it got tangled somewhere the chain broke 😭<br />But the elephant is still in good condition, I have it on my nightstand. ❤❤"
4.0,Like the color of these. I have other 90 degree e-mails and would buy these again.
4.0,"Soft, cute and warm! My only complaint is that there is no liner and it's a bit linty."
4.0,Fits perfect. No issues.
4.0,Mine came beautiful The logo thing came out a Lil uneven but other that that I love it!
4.0,The pendant itself is great but at the top the part that attaches it to the chain looks like it was not constructed very well. not sure it will hold.but I Love the details on the pendant.
4.0,"I really like the fit, though at 5'10 I wish it werea bit longer."
4.0,"Nice dress, little big in chest for me"
4.0,"A little smaller than typical 3/4&#34; plugs, I didn't notice until they came in that they're actually 18mm instead of 19mm. Nonetheless I like them & will be rocking them. I'd rather the plugs be on the smaller side anyway rather than be too big and not be able to wear them at all."
4.0,This is a fun little bracelet for the summer.  It reminds me of the kind we'd make as kids with beach shells (or even cereal).  It's on a stretchy string so it will fit everyone.  If you're looking for a casual piece of wrist candy that won't break the budget then this line of affordable jewelry from Glitziest will let you purchase 3 or 4 or more.<br /><br />This choice is one of many.  It has tiny cowrie shells  in a tutti fruitti color combo.  This will be appropriate for any age group.  It's really cute.  BTW - I've seen similar items at some of the trendy shops in Newport for 3x the price-point.
4.0,"Nice as made warm but light. However, a little bit narrow and 2 inches short from the other scarf sizes I wear at all times."
4.0,"VERY VERY PRETTY , JUST A LITTLE BIGGER THA EXPECTED BUT STILL VERY CUTE"
4.0,Didn't really look like the picture
4.0,I had purchased the blue one but returned it because it was like a dark purple (not blue) and the zipper was very noticeable down my back.  The black dress fit as expected on my waist but the chest area was a little big.  I used the tape to keep it in place but was a little uncomfortable doing that because it was noticeable.  I wouldn't buy it again.
4.0,"Worked fine, all spikes were secure when I received these"
4.0,"The cape is beautiful and fits nicely on the shoulders. However it wasn't cut right at the mottom, the left hung lower than the right near the bottom. Can be fixed if you know how to sew."
4.0,GREAT BELTS AND GREAT BUY
4.0,Bought as a add on gift for wife.  great little dress for the small price.  simple.
4.0,"This item really works!  I used it to wear for a while to decide if I wanted to get my nose pierced.  It looked the part and fooled some, lol!  The only thing was I had to use a little cosmetic glue for it to stick better."
4.0,Way smaller than I thought they’d be.  You can barely tell it’s hello kitty
4.0,As described...can scratch jewelry if not careful
4.0,Great glasses but they are a little flimsy. Also I believe I was sent the wrong pair but it's no big deal
4.0,Love most Lands’ End<br />These are no exception<br />Small caveats:<br />If you don’t like wide waistband you might hesitate<br />There is a bit of pilling after teo gentle- cold washes<br />Itherwise<br />Like this set a lot
4.0,Nice Beanie for the price but had a strange smell to it :/
4.0,It fit very well.  I am glad I made this purchase.
4.0,"the jacket did its job as a water-resistant and windproof. used it in New Zealand especially with all the rain, I was glad I bought a rain jacket for the trip. this jacket didn't hold for long with the constant drizzling of rain with hiking or exploring the outdoors."
4.0,"I'd give it a 5, but there isnt a switch to turn it on and off. Putting the batteries in turns them on and taking the batteries out turns them off. Other than that they are really cool."
4.0,Good for the price dose not peel
4.0,This set is very lovely It looks so delicate and feminine.. I will be giving it as a Christmas gift and I am sure the recipient will be thrilled with them.
4.0,Beautiful - Better than I expected
4.0,"This scarf is 100% polyester and is EXACTLY like the scarf I bought for only $3 at Sam Moon Trading Co. in Frisco, TX.  If you're not anywhere near a Sam Moon, then of course, the price is fine."
4.0,"These fit well and are excellent for kayaking on a warm to moderate day. Also, reasonably good for jello wrestling, if you want a competitive edge and don't want to ruin your regular kicks."
4.0,Watch looks nice but the brand packing Is horrible... Looks haggard.. I’m concerned the watch may also be damaged based on the look of the brand box.. We’ll see
4.0,"Look good, solid, very affordable"
4.0,Love!  Going to a festival in June. These will be perfect.
4.0,"Flashy, attention grabbing high tops. Vibrant lights, mirror like finish. Great for events, cosplay, and clubbing. Easy to use<br />Charge 1st<br />Red lights turn green, done!<br />Pinch inner button to change mode or power off"
4.0,Looks nice and very versatile.  Supre comfortable.
4.0,"Very sexy! This dress can be dressed up with a pair of heels or dressed down with a pair of sneakers. I have this dress in 6 different colors, just cant go wrong with this little number.😍"
4.0,Great quality for the price.<br />If you like the top<br />ZANZEA<br />Women Cotton Deep V Neck Low Cut Long Sleeve Slim Shirt Ruched Tee Top Blouse
4.0,"I'm so happy I bought my daughter this dress well before her birthday. I had purchased this dress for her 5th birthday and I bought a 4t instead of a 5t so it would fit just right. When she tried it on it was too small! It fit like it could be a 3t. The part that should be at her waist was at her rib cage and the bottom of the dress laid mid thy.  So I had to reorder another one in a 5t. When the 5t came in it was TOO BIG! Instead of the bottom part laying at her knees it layed to the middle of her legs, like a Sunday dress, it was also a lil baggy at the top. She and I loved the dress so much that I decided to just hem up the bottom layer and It fit just right.<br />I also would like too add that the dress does not look the same color as in the picture and that it can come in different shades of the champagne color. The first dress I ordered was a different shade than the 2nd and neither were the same color as the picture. You should also know that the dress isn't nearly as fluffy as the picture. We still loved the dress."
4.0,This was purchased for a child for a charity that I am involved in.  It looks great and I hope it fits her
4.0,So much better than the silicone bands. Initially it didn't feel like it locked on the watch well and was hard to remove but the more I have used it the more easily the locking and removing connection.
4.0,the wrinkles are kinda heard yo get out when it came but it’s cute. zipper is a little big so i’d the adjustable strap. but matches outfits and looks great
4.0,"Did not come with instructions for setting time.  One can find them on the web, but not very conveniently.<br />Light is a little less bright than I would like."
4.0,Super cute. Way big.
4.0,"Lovely dress, but didn't like the fit on me. The material is pretty heavy for summer, as I had planned, but cute fall dress. I am 5'8&#34; and the dress did not touch floor."
4.0,"I dislike the length of the dress I'm only 5ft 2 ins. and this dress covers my toes and beyond, I wished it was a little shorter to fit short women like myself, other wise its a lovely dress."
4.0,The variety is great. If you’re looking to add a pop of color at a low price this is your go to tassel set.<br />They’re pretty bright and light. Everything came in tact and no missing pieces!
4.0,Its a lovely watch that works just fine. For what I paid its great.
4.0,"This arrived on time. Nice quantity, but I feel like it was a little over priced for what I got. No worries though, my college student loved it as a Christmas gift."
4.0,"Compre estos lentes para mi hijo de 12 años, es Basebolista, amó combinar los lentes con su uniforme de baseball y con ropas ocasiones casuales, el case es bastante fuerte para evitar roturas"
4.0,Very nice looking and good quality. So nice someone stole it off my desk at work.
4.0,Straps are not quite long enough even when adjusted
4.0,"I bought several bands in different colors.  I wish the red wasn’t so reddish-orange.  But, all bands are nice."
4.0,"I love the size of the face and that it is very eady to read.  You need to pay attention to the size given in the description, as the seller also states.  The face is much bigger that the average watch, and the band is not as long as most.<br /> My one concern is the thickness of the band, which is VERY thin.  I don't know how well it is going to hold up over the long run.  I had to get a leather band because I was breaking out from the metal expansion band I had.  Next time I will look for a higher quality band."
4.0,I like it. Looks like the picture. Some of the smaller stones were coming out.
4.0,"A little bit short for me, I have to wear black pants even when I ordered XL for my large size<br />Also the fabric is very thin & polyestery<br />But over all, it looks sporty and very cute"
4.0,"good fit, rather warm worn inside trousers.  don't seem to ride up much or stretch out of shape like others."
4.0,Cool ítem thanks
4.0,Fits as expected and fast delivery.  Matches Running short exactly.  See http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HY3MUCW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 .
4.0,It was nice i got it for my gf n she loved it
4.0,My husband and I liked this product; The mens  Black fishnet costume came in a very nice package. As well as shipping was fast. This outfit came as pictured (Black colored) and is made of fishnet like fabric and  PVC leather like material. This actually did look awesome on him and was a good look for men.<br /><br />The size was eh a little on smaller size even though it is OSFM.  Although I think they need to up those sizes a little. However it did fit. The shorts are like hot pants and the shirt is like a sleeveless tee. The stitching is ok and looks like it should hold. It also matches the color of the fabrics. Although the picture showed very little belly on the pictured model.. Depending upon your partners frame there may/may not be a noticeable difference and the belly will probably show more if wider.<br /><br />We liked the look and feel of this product and would recommend it to others as well. Would be a good role play BDSM outfit. This outfit is definitely on our top 10 list. The quality was acceptable.<br /><br />I received this at a discount for my honest unbiased opinion.
4.0,Exactly what I was looking for. Cups are half full of padding to push you up. Normally I'm a 34A but ordered a 34B since that was the smallest available. Cups for perfect but the band is pretty tight. I think a 36B would fit perfect. Pretty great deal if you get the right size. $5/bra! I do wish there was a nude bra in the set though. Only 4 stars because of the size issue and lack of nude color which is the color I wear most.
4.0,Very comfortable after I tore the tags out.
4.0,"Was missing a screw for the gold strip at the top of the glasses. Thought about returning them but it's too much of a hassle, especially since I don't see the missing part to be for any other purpose than to hold down the gold strip; and it's sturdy enough to not slip out by itself anyway.<br /><br />If ever it does fall apart on me, I hope it's after a couple of years and I've well and truly replaced these by then. haha"
4.0,Much smaller than expected. But still good quality product.
4.0,"Sadly, I had to return this bra because the cups were too big. However, I'm still giving it a 4 star review. Why? Because my best friend also bought this bra. She's the reason I bought myself one in the first place, and it looks SOOOOO GOOD on her. It's really a fantastic bra, as long as you've got the boobs to fill it. It wrangles in that stubborn armpit fat, completely eliminates the dreaded back-boobs, and it feels like a hug. The fabric is so soft, and the elastic bits feel really strong and of good quality. When she put hers on for the first time, she cried because she didn't know bras could be this comfortable. I'm quite sad my boobs were too small for this bra. I thought I was a C cup, but I guess not :("
4.0,Saphir is the best show care products on the market period!
4.0,My wife loves it! Colors seem a bit light to me..
4.0,"This bathing suit is adorable, but they run small. I got a large and its to tight! Im 5'5 about 132 pounds.  Will return for xl"
4.0,Nobody had  any trouble figuring out the costume. 100/100 for a corn on the cob child on a budget
4.0,Well constructed for active play.
4.0,"My daughter loves it, but got a small hole in it on day one. The top is very small, so might want to purchase another one"
4.0,"I purchased this knowing it would be a little short per the other reviews. While it does look cute on, you won't get much wear out of it as a dress. Maybe 3 inches more to the length, and it would have been perfect!"
4.0,Used it for a charm and perfect length
4.0,"My husband has a very large head (hat size 8 1/4) and has a hard time finding glasses that fit well. These fit perfectly. They are clearly not $300 sunglasses, but seem well made. A great deal for the money."
4.0,Ordered medium normally wear 4/6 in dress size. Thin tee shirt material.
4.0,Nice loose top. I got the large and it stretches a bit as you wear it. I sized up so I can wear something loose when working out. It's a bit low cut but looks fine with a sports bra when working out.
4.0,Cute and I like that it was flexible on my toe!  For the money I like it so far and I sleep with it on and don't even notice its there.  It hasn't turned my toe green yet.  I have been wearing it for a week.  Shiny and sexy and comfy!  Just my style!!
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised, although a bit frustrated, it's still loose on me, but I figured as much. Adorable with a red skirt on the weekend."
4.0,I was expecting double material layering but other than that it’s really pretty. Thin so perfect for Spring.
4.0,"1 out of the 4 already broke around the clip. Lucky the metal piece that holds the elastic band by the clip is a easy remove. I was able to fix it, but I lost some slack. Daughter still loves them"
4.0,"I love these t shirts and will definitely be buying them again.  They are very soft, wash and dry without shrinkage and have a flattering fit. I found them to be true to size.  Although not heavy, the material is substantial and should wear well."
4.0,At the moment this design is sold out in macs shop and everywhere else that sells the official one is second hand and too expensive.<br />Also the logo is wayy bigger than picture shown...<br />But overall i cannot complain.<br />Decent hat.<br />Stiching has a few loose strigs but nothing a liighter cant take care of.<br />Very satisfied with purchase.
4.0,"Although I do love my oversized sweatshirts, this one may be a wee bit too big. I still wear it all the time though! Because it is your average sweatshirt, it pilled within the third of fourth day of wearing it. When I first got it, the inside was extremely soft. It's thick, good quality, and I have had no issues with the stitches coming loose. Would recommend! Just make sure you know the right size to get."
4.0,These zipper charms are small but very cute.
4.0,"Nice fit,  I had a little belly in this dress, but it still fit well."
4.0,These socks with vintage style cars etc are just too adorable.
4.0,"I love the pants. The colors are amazing and the fabric feels so good. But they are smaller than I thought. I ordered a medium and they are a little too short. Other than that, I love them."
4.0,It wore and felt as expected.
4.0,Bought this for my 24yrs old daughter and it is absolutely adorable!<br />for reference purchased a small - she is 5'1 about 100 lbs
4.0,"Super cute,  size is off. My niece won't be able to wear this for a few more months,  but it's super cute!"
4.0,"The wallet is really well made, but the slot for holding money is a bit small making it difficult to place the bills in it, and retrieve them. This may improve with use? I've only been using it for a week or so."
4.0,This belt was a great accessory to my white pants and white body suit. It almost made it look like I had a one piece set on.
4.0,Beautiful!!! If you have sensitive skin you may have to apply a ointment of some sort. My neck developed a rash. Still beautiful!!!!!
4.0,"I purchased these glasses because since my cataract surgery its difficult to drive at night due to high beam glare. These glasses looked and fit very well. I tried them first during a rainy day and they worked well. However at night did not cut any glare at all. I gave it 4 stars because I did like them, but had to return."
4.0,A Little pricey for a Man made material Tote bag.
4.0,Yea baby!
4.0,"Loose fit, looks good."
4.0,True to size. The pockets have zippers reinforcements.<br />The material is light-weight.
4.0,"Decent. Length was a little long for me. The quality, for the price, was good."
4.0,"these are nice, but could not use stoppers inside them"
4.0,"Love the look of this band. The material however, has a strange feel & the white pArts came looking discolored."
4.0,The pictures provided are what you get and nothing more. I purchased this watch for 16 dollars and do not regret it. It was what I was looking for.
4.0,"Es un lindo vestido para cualquier ocasión , lo único que no me gusta es el zipper muy sencillo y espero que sea duradero  , la talla es muy ajustada ordene un L pero quizás si eres una mujer con curvas debes ordenar la siguiente talla"
4.0,"Got for my 10 yr old son for Halloween, didn’t realize it was for adults but it still fitted his head. I had to use a wig cap to make his curly hair flat so the wig could go on. It came flat hair so I did add monkey gel to style the wig into Spikes. Followed up with a blow dryer and it stayed. Love the color as well!"
4.0,"I have been really pleased. Wear them for day and night driving and on construction jobsites. Great. Bought a pair for a friend, who has really hard time driving at night and she loves them.They work really well. Actually better than some more expensive ones. Yeah, they're cheap glasses and aren't going to last forever. But I'm pretty careful with them  and I've had this pair for over a year, I think. When these break or get too scratched, I'll buy another pair. For the price, I think they're worth it."
4.0,I love these but they ran small.  I have to return them. Hopefully a Suze up fits
4.0,I use this cardigan for at-home wear.  It's soft and comfortable and aesthetically pleasing as well.<br />This is a definite recommend.
4.0,"Works as described and looks cool, just wears out quicker than expected."
4.0,I would give this one 5 stars if the bottoms weren't so skimpy. the top fits great and is made well with nice material. I ordered a Large and normally wear a 36C. The bottoms fit but they really don't cover a whole lot of the behind and a super low rise in the front. I am 5'2 and 130lbs I usually wear size 4-6 in bottoms.
4.0,Got this for my daughter since she lives the Greek key. Very pretty. She liked it a lot.
4.0,"It's a little awkward to wear, a bit uncomfortable. But great quality"
4.0,Looks great.  Color was a little different than I expected from the pictures online.
4.0,"I previously reported this didn't fit pandora bracelet.  I was wrong.  It screws over the fastener piece, I was just trying to put on wrong.  It's a great addition to my pandora bracelet"
4.0,Has a nice slim fit and looks great on
4.0,"This dress was super cute. Runs a bit small and short and the sleeves were very tight but it is adorable. Usually a 2x but can get into 3x with it being very tight. If you are tall, this may be very short for you. I am 4’11 and it comes to just at the knee for me."
4.0,"I think the band size was generous but the cup was too small for me, it seems like it would be so comfortable if it was my size. Nicely made, was excited about the quality when I opened the package."
4.0,These are kinda big...but pretty.  Not quite as dark as the picture.  A little cheap looking...
4.0,So far no complaints. I got this to protect the old ears when working outside. I thought I might not like the chin strap. I haven't needed it yet but it hasn't bothered me either. I like it.
4.0,"I have an older Joe Rocket jacket that came with the harder ""turtle shell"" armor, which literally crumbled with age. I'm not sure why that happened, but I ended up needed new armor and as the jacket was not new, I didn't want to spend more than the worth of the jacket on new armor. I was very happy to find this product. It seems to be lighter and more sturdy than the armor I am replacing, and it fit fine in my jacket. The picture depicts holes in the yellow pieces of armor, but it is in two layers, and the holes don't go through the inner layer. Other than that, I believe that this is a very good deal, and the armor seems to be of similar quality to that which comes with low and mid priced motorcycle jackets."
4.0,"This dress is very elegant, fabric is a lil stretchy, almost spandex.  Ordered it on Sunday. Got it today, Oct  3rd. It was Free Shipping for any items over $25....I ordered a L. I am 5'4&quot;...165 lbs. It's very long and flare, but that's ok, as I plan to get it alter. People don't let the negative reviews, make you not ordered. Can't wait to wear it on my cruise."
4.0,Ran small I thought
4.0,"Great quality, just a little big for me.  Took a while to arrive, I did not know they were coming from France."
4.0,"Great bag, but an inside zipper pocket would have been perfect!"
4.0,"This belt was constructed very well, but I didn't like the dark brown color when I got it (just me), so it was returned for a full refund."
4.0,"Great hat, if your head is larger than 22 1/2 &#34;.  Mine is 22 1/4&#34; and hat fell down over my ears.  It is wrongly describes as being 22&#34;. I had to return it due to large size."
4.0,"These are beautiful. They look real, are high gloss, and just gorgeous. I can't believe the price for such pretty earrings! My error was that I thought the shape would be more oval (see the first picture). These are completely round to match my completely round face :/ I like ovals because they offset the roundness of my face shape. But these are still very elegant and I'm keeping them."
4.0,"Fit as expected, very thin though, no lining at all."
4.0,"Above the knee, see through.  Needs a slip which makes it hot to wear.  Looks an awful lot like an old nurse uniform."
4.0,I liked the fit of the dress but didn't like the material. The gray dress looks and feels like gray sweat pants.
4.0,Nice swimsuit cover-up
4.0,"Really nice, thick quality raglan and I like the style but I ordered my usual size M and it was too loose in the sleeves and bodice. I would order a size down if you want a more ""fitted"" look."
4.0,If I want to button it then it's a little bit small. But otherwise it fits good!
4.0,"Great price and my son loved them.  Bigger than I expected, but they look very nice and seem to be holding up well."
4.0,La tela es muy finita
4.0,My order came with all unique pieces. Great variety.
4.0,These are good expensive underwear.  They stay put for the most part.  They are soft and comfortable.
4.0,"The cap gets 5 stars for style and quality, however, as far as fit is concerned, I'm 0 for 2. I first ordered the size 7, but is was so small, that it wouldn't even go the sides of my head. I then ordered the 7 3/8 and that cap is way too big."
4.0,This arrived so wrinkled it was hard to even get a good look at it when I tried it on. Although it is a bit tight I decided to hang on to it to see if it will look better once it relaxes a bit.
4.0,Cute rings for the price but unfortunately they don't really fit any of my fingers.
4.0,Work great but they weren't quit deep enough for for my frames ; but I'm happy with them all in all .
4.0,This dress is a nice material but has no stretch - it is very short and cute but looks strange in the breast area.  Kinda reminds me of a night gown.  It runs a bit small too.
4.0,Love love love this shirt but by the time it arrived I had purchased another. Wish I had waited.
4.0,"I purchased the product in the size Large, I am 5'4&#34; 147lbs. They fit comfortably snug. I do see what the other buyers have been saying about it fitting slightly loose near the knee area (nothing too noticeable). They pants did come up a lot higher than I expected, past my belly button (which was something I was not too fond of, although it does hide any possible muffin top). Probably won't work out in them, but they're great for lounging at home or running quick errands."
4.0,These tops fit well and and look good.
4.0,"Love it!! I lost weight and I got a medium, it was lil big. My fault on that. Good quality"
4.0,"I love these leggings, I have 3 pairs of them so far. I’m tall with long legs, so these are a bit short on me, but it’s not a huge deal for me."
4.0,"Works great. Shes taken them on hikes, over boulders, in snow, through puddles, the rain, and in rivers. Never complains about sore feet, and she's almost always dry at the end of the day. This is our second pair and neither have had visible scuffs. Still in good condition to wear with dresses like she prefers when we aren't in nature."
4.0,I like the material these panties are made of and for the most part I like the fit.  They do not cup the buttock like most panties...just gently hug the curve of your butt.  Best thing I like is no panty line in slacks...would I purchase again?  more than likely.
4.0,Cute sun hat..fits perfectly..happy with the purchase..
4.0,great product for the price. would recommend
4.0,I love the material and colors.  The pants were loose but the shirt was more tighter fitting.
4.0,This top is really cute and does not wrinkle at all. I am 5 ft 2 and it covers my tush too
4.0,"This bra is ok but if ur really thin, the underwire will kill u. But I took them out and now it's very comfortable and fits gr8👍🏻"
4.0,"Not expensive,but it LOOKS expensive.  The date function on most watches are hard for me to read without my glasses.  This one shows FIVE dates.  All you have to do if find the middle one.  Wish the hands glowed better at night."
4.0,"These are great for someone with bigger arms, it's kind of large for someone with thinner arms and can even slide down.  That said, the quality is very good, the material is soft."
4.0,Loved it came on time cute velvet bag
4.0,"The band is starting to fade on the inside of both bands. Otherwise,  it's very pretty"
4.0,Nice fit and color.  Pleasantly surprised..
4.0,Love them but a little short. Dont stay up for long.
4.0,A little bit bulky but I like it alot.
4.0,Nice shirt and good fit. The pink was not like in the picture but still a good shirt.
4.0,I like this ring but I didn't know it was open on the rings shank.  Makes it look cheap
4.0,A little bigger than I thought it would be. But its ok.
4.0,"I love this swimsuit! The negative for me is that I’m 4’11, petite with 32DD top and medium bottom so I have to order larger for my top and bottom but things can be too big around my back as this is. They never make things thinking about tiny people with curves so this is too big around the top half of me but the bottom fits perfectly. I usually wear a size 3-4 and smalls in tops if that helps get an idea. Medium fit for my breast size but I needed an option to tighten it more around my back so it’s not so loose."
4.0,"WAY too large, thin material.  It is ok and fine for layering and working out.  It is a good product, but as a 5'8&#34; 110lb 32DDD gal, this is far too big.  I have to find someone to donate them to."
4.0,"They are so flattering and cool looking, and really comfortable, and great at temp regulation and moisture wicking.  But the fabric is getting really rough and pilling up where my thighs rub together at the top.  I've had them 4.5 months... I probably wear them once every couple weeks.  It's a bummer... we'll see how long it takes for them to be completely worn out."
4.0,Very nice product...thanks.
4.0,Adorable little hat and great price for the quality.
4.0,"Wanted a quick release. Although these do not fit my helmet straps. Ill find use for them.  Thyre a good quality construction.  Shipping was a little slow but, its the holiday season.  I can't blame the seller."
4.0,"It's pretty cute but it does fit a little big. I was hoping it would shrink in the wash, but it only did a little."
4.0,i'd add a photo but the fae already stole the necklace
4.0,"Really cute, I wish I had sized up some, but really stylish with flair out jeans!!"
4.0,"These glasses have no bend in them.  They are straight across your face.  So you get a lot of light coming in through the sides.  I would not buy these again but, (see update).  I am planning on wearing them in my pool and not as my everyday sunglasses liked I planned to do.<br /><br />Update: The company contacted me and because I was not happy with them, they offered me a full refund.  Knowing that this company was willing to do that, makes me willing to buy from them again, if I were to find another pair I liked."
4.0,"The colors were just as I wanted them to be! I purchased the light/dark purple, and WOW....it was gorgeous out of the box! The ONLY problem I have is the sizing. I usually purchase 3X when wearing spandex to get the slightly relaxed fit around the stomach I want. This 3X fits like a 2X. If you are looking for the relaxed fit, (they don't have 4X) instead of the very snug fit, go one size up.  I have to wear extra spanx to get the relaxed fit around the stomach area, cause I want this skirt for next week....no time to lose stomach. I purchased the black with the ruffle across the front, and it is beautiful. with the same fit."
4.0,This is cool and comfortable.My only complaint is that it wrinkles a lot<br />and I&#34;m allergic to ironing.
4.0,A little tight around the calves.  Fairly easy to get on and off as compared to knee high compression socks.
4.0,"Really cool mouse pad that looks great. I take one star away because the black surface came unglued after only a few days but I was able to use some crazy glue to re apply it fairly easily. In truth I might have rated it slightly lower because the surface area is a bit small for a standard sized mouse and I have had issues with hitting the silver plastic top of the usb hub box at the top of it and getting hung up in games, but the usb ports allow me to charge my cell phone through them and I love that so it makes up for it in my opinion. I get compliments from my friends whenever they see it. It really does look awesome!"
4.0,"At first I ordered a medium (I'm 5'3&#34;, 110lb) and it was too big.  Re-ordered it in small, perfect!"
4.0,Great print but I forgot to read it was stretchy material
4.0,"I bought this dress for my Lady Loki costume for Halloween. It looked beautiful, but it hung very loosely around my chest and my waist. I'm 5'9 and 155lb and ordered a size medium. I should have ordered a size down. However, I do like the fabric quite a bit, and the color was mysterious and gorgeous."
4.0,"This coat is really cute for the money, but it's a little tight in the shoulders. Also I noticed that a grommet was broken off when I got it. Overall very nice jacket so far."
4.0,They come as shown in picture. They are all put into a little bag when delivered. But overall very cute and worth the price!
4.0,"This is a great little dress and can also be worn as a tunic top.  I am about 5'7&#34; 135 lbs and I ordered the medium and it fit well.  I actually knotted it with jeans and layered it with a black floral duster cardigan and it looked adorable.  The fabric isn't the most comfortable and as someone else pointed out, the striped don't completely match up on the side seams, but for the price, it is a nice addition to my closet!"
4.0,"Not the same shade of blue as the picture, but otherwise it is it met my expectations. Lays well and looks nice against around my neck."
4.0,"The fabric is cheap, like wrapping paper, but it’s great for the summer fast drying and looks great on!"
4.0,It is great.  Just what I was looking for
4.0,I like the watch. Very stylish. Just having problems with the automatic watch winder to keep it on time.
4.0,"Super pretty and I love it, just don't run a marathon with it, the worst chafing ever."
4.0,I like the shorts.  Came from China.  Only thing I wish was it had a mesh lining inside.  Colorful and go with anything.  I am short legged and just  above the knee..  Have a drawstring for tightening of the waist.  Comfortable.
4.0,"I was impressed with the generous size of the duffle bag, the quality of the leather, and the heavy-duty zippers. The only thing I didn't like was that the handles and trim are NOT genuine leather, but a man-made product. For the money, it is a good buy. The purchase is for a Christmas gift for my sister. I plan to purchase another for my father."
4.0,This particular bathrobe is comfortable and fits great.
4.0,"These are slightly tricky to place , but a small jewelry plier worked for me. These are very pliable. I can't feel them like I can the hard plastic things. They don't slip once tightened onto the band. I am pleased."
4.0,"This band is the correct replacement for my Casio Model DW 5600E watch, matching the fit of the original. It is tedious to install, but that is just a function of the design, not a knock against this replacement band. It's a user-friendly watch, so it's worth a little work to keep it useful rather than replacing it."
4.0,IT SAY IT FIT 8-9 BUT I WEAR AN 8 AND IT IS WAY BIG FOR ME. HAVING TO PUT PAPER TOWELS IN TOE AN STILL NOT COMFORTABLE ON MY FEET.
4.0,"This item took a very long time to arrive. It was a gift but worth the wait. My friend is a recording artist who absolutely adored this product. It is light weight, securly packaged and the print was not too bad. I was expecting a more vivid picture but it wasnt bad"
4.0,"I like it because it seems to be very durable.  But not so happy with the size of the main compartment.  I liked that you can unzip it on 3 sides so it opens like a suitcase, but just doesn't have a lot of space."
4.0,Bought this necklace for my girlfriend for her rush theme galaxy. It met expectations except for the galaxy picture was not as bright as I wanted it to be. However it is still an amazing necklace!
4.0,"Love the looks and all the pockets!  They run quite large, but other than that, they're great!"
4.0,"Great socks, just as good of quality as name brand socks. Will buy again."
4.0,its a little big for my hand but its a really nice band and its also a very fashionable band
4.0,"I received this corset for free to test and evaluate. The following is my evaluation results after testing it.<br /><br />The first things I will note here is that it is an over the bust corset. This requires different measuring than an under bust corset. Please,mplease, please, do not order your bra band size. Measure yourself with a tape. Don't assume or go by your normal size. If your measurements do not match the seller's chart, contact the seller. (always look carefully at the description and pictures, use the chart there if there is one, instead of the Amazon generic chart.)<br /><br />Okay, measured? Now... Listen to the pros and the cons of this particular corset. It is a for show corset. It has fairly stiff &#34;bones&#34;, but they do have flex. That is okay if you need flex. Flex in this case means slight flex, you shouldn't try to bend in it. It is stiff and the top doesn't roll down if it is accurately sized.<br /><br />The back fastens with ribbons vs stronger lacing, but that said, these ribbons will do the job. They are around 1/4 inch wide and thick enough to fasten the corset securely.<br /><br />This is not a &#34;hold the bedpost and cinch it down&#34; corset. If you are aggressive, you will deform or break the stays. If you wear it too tight, the stays aka bones will pierce the fabric and poke out. This is designed to be worn snug but not compressing the body severely. In short, the ribbons don't need to be cinched, you will damage the corset if you get aggressive.<br /><br />This is a well made corset, but it is not a corset for body modification. (If you don't know what body modification is, you are not looking for it.)<br /><br />The ribbons lace from the top to the middle and from the bottom to the middle. This is a good way to lace a corset to be sure it is more comfortable when it is over bust.<br /><br />All stitches are sturdy, the lace is sewn on correctly, the garter straps are adjustable. The small triangle panty matches the color of the corset. It is sewn properly but not designed for weekly use. It's a fantasy panty as many included with corsets are, a token scrap of matching fabric, not designed for long term wearability.<br /><br />Be sure to unlace this and any other corset fully before putting it on and unlace before taking it off. This extra step helps keep the fabric from breaking down.<br /><br />To sum up, this is a well designed corset that is made for light duty. With gentle treatment it will last without breaking down or having the bones pop out."
4.0,"Love this, love the way it glitters"
4.0,They stay in place and work just fine but even using the biggest pieces have made the shoe too tight for comfort
4.0,A bit thinner than I expected but I could’ve been worse. But I like them!
4.0,Socks are cute but not as thick as I would have wanted for our cold winters up north.
4.0,"This is a set of decorative butterfly pins. The pins are made of metal with enamel painting on the front. They have spring-clasps on the backs. They measure about 1.25” wide by nearly 1” long. They come in individual ziplock bags.<br /><br />I find these pins fun to wear. They go well on hats, etc. They are nothing special, however. The metal is quite cheap and has a cheap feel to it. If I bought these pins individually, I would probably be willing to spend up to $1.25 a piece for them. In the set, 2 of the pins are dark and look best on light surfaces, while the other one is light and shows up best on dark surfaces. Overall, these pins are fun to wear but aren’t special enough to be gifts except as maybe party favors for small children."
4.0,Couldn’t get through my piercing despite it saying it’s 16g. Slightly larger. Best for healed piercings. Don’t jam this through a fresh one.
4.0,"The flap that is inserted into the wallet isn't quite as stiff as I expected, but works well.<br />The answer windows above are for shoes and are somewhat odd."
4.0,It's not a soft rose color but more a deep mauve. Its pretty but not as pretty as the picture.
4.0,Nice print. My 6 year old loves Mario but a little thin. It didnt take long for my son to get a hole in the glove and the fuzzy ball fell off in a couple of days. Would rebuy though for the simple fact you can't find Mario merchandise in the stores. My son looked gorgeous in this hat.
4.0,"replaces my old work sweatshirt. feels just like my old one which lasted about 4 years or so, very happy"
4.0,"The design and thought process behind this case is solid. The leather really makes the case stand out and I have received multiple compliments about it. The air pods fit perfectly inside as well. The only downside is that the plastic interior of the case does not flex enough to allow the lid to open fully so it kind of pops in and out. It still works well and this may be the design of the case, but it may need to be separated into two pieces to achieve full open. I am still very happy with the case though!"
4.0,"It's a bit on the longer side, so when taking it off it has a tendency to touch the floor. But otherwise I like it. It's SUPER SOFT!"
4.0,"I like the shorts but I was expecting them to be tighter and more fitted but even though i got a small and I typically a small or medium in clothes, the shorts were still not as tight as i hoped. But over all still comfy and cute."
4.0,Love the design! BUT I was hoping the item was designed with bigger triangles at least an inch larger.  They are well made but are still delicate to a degree. I would of given 5 stars if they were larger. Based on the tribal origins of gauges as ear ornaments The designs  should be larger.
4.0,The black color on the words faded quickly (even washing inside out it barely lasted a month) so its almost like a dark grey color instead of black but other than that I love it!
4.0,"These sleeves are the answer to what I was looking for.  Protection while driving.  The only reason I took off one star is that they could be a couple inches longer to cover the upper arm with cap sleeves.<br />I get sun poisoning with even short exposure.  I just took a weekend trip with a 3 hr drive each way and my only break out is on my right hand (where I was not using the hand protection of the sleeve for a while).<br />Very light-weight, loose enough to be easy on/ easy off."
4.0,One of the best products I've ordered online.
4.0,A little difficult to put on but once on the are attractive.
4.0,"For the price u can't beat it, I would order at least a size up. I'm 6 foot 190 lbs and an extra large fits a little snug."
4.0,Genial para hacer reír a los amigos
4.0,"Beautiful suit, however, it's a thin material which leaves you exposed."
4.0,These are good if you are using them for painting but not good to use with a heat press.
4.0,The goggles are great. Love the case and tint. They will get a little foggy after wearing but are comfortable. The attached ear plugs are super. You never loose them and they fit perfect. The swim cap is roomy and does not slip off like some rubber/silicone caps. The cap does not keep out all water but it keeps my natural hair in place so I still look cute after a swim. I didn't use the nose clip. It seemed to be too tight. Overall great deal and great quality.  I recommended this to a few friends.
4.0,There were perfect! Exactly as advertised.
4.0,"I wish the cedar scent was stronger.  Other than that, really, they are perfect in fit, comfort, and, to a lesser degree, eliminating foot<br />odor.  I sprinkle some baking soda underneath to help."
4.0,"Really cute. Its small and thin. very lovely. My only problem is the ears, they're a bit smaller and less pointed than I expected they'd be"
4.0,The glass could fit a little tighter on the face. As far as the look they are beautiful.
4.0,Daughter really likes them both pair
4.0,Great stocking stuffers for the price.
4.0,It’s nice but not super cute.
4.0,Great quality and good fit. The arms roll up and I wish the arms were longer.
4.0,"A bit on the larger side, one size fits all downside.<br /><br />Label states cannot be washed because it will remove FR coating.<br /><br />Other than that it is warm and comfortable under a hard hat."
4.0,"I love the look and style of this shirt, but it's too small for me.  Darn!"
4.0,It’s lightweight and received many compliments. I purchased it specifically for July 4th festivities but wore it all summer.
4.0,"Fast delivery, perfect size for a 5 US size until 7,5 I think (for woman size). The colors are a little bit darker irl but it's okay. It seems to be good quality (I can't wait to use them). The designs are very cute and cool !"
4.0,It fit true to size. Nice
4.0,"I like the pajamas very much, but I’m 5 feet 3 inches tall and the bottoms are very long. I will hem them but I wish shorter bottoms were available."
4.0,"I bought the shirt for golf. It’s a lighter weight knit fabric so I will layer it for winter but it will be fine on it’s own when it warms up. I love the argyle pattern but was unsure if the dark color was blue or black. I believe it’s black but I think a dark navy bottom will be ok too. Fit wise, I usually opt for a medium and this medium “fits.” I returned it for a large but it’s a really cute shirt!"
4.0,"Fits as expected,"
4.0,It is a beautiful top but loose around the arms.
4.0,"Me gustó pero creo que no atiné con la talla ya que la tela parece ser un poco elástica y me queda un poquitín holgado, generalmente soy small , pero creo que en este modelo debo ser XS. En general es una buena compra."
4.0,Works well for my son
4.0,Look great very happy with this purchase.
4.0,"I love this! I do not have petite wrists and I always have difficulty finding cool things that fit. I also love the magnetic closure - very easy to put on by yourself. The only CON is that the metal logo slides around - I wish it was secured so that it would just stay in the middle, it currently falls to the side often...but other than that it's great!"
4.0,"I like them and think they're very comfy.  My hubby, however, says they're ugly and look like &#34;old lady shoes.&#34;  😉"
4.0,"Like the design, materials nice and soft."
4.0,"This is a cute beach cover up. I like the long length with the slits up the sides. Overall, the size fits me, but the sleeves are just a tad snug. I do have fat arms, so it's not surprising. The colors are bright and fun! Now I need a beach trip so I can wear it!"
4.0,"I liked the different sizes, and the colors are great."
4.0,"Little small for a large, I would order x-large if ordering again"
4.0,"Very very light,"
4.0,"Great fit and don't slip, 1 star deducted because they are actually see thru during yoga whole stretching far, better for regular workout use."
4.0,"The only issue I have with these is that the compression isn't as good as some others that I have. I have an ankle injury that swells dramatically without compression socks. I like these because they are warm, but have others that control the ankle swelling better."
4.0,"This is a really nice size set of bangles.  You get 24 standard sized small metal bracelets.  These are coated on the inside with what feels like a wax coating.  The coating doesn't rub off on you or get onto your clothing I think it is just the way they were made.  The coating is a yellow color and looks good when wearing the bracelets, gives the visible inside of the bracelet another effect. These do have a bit of glitter/sparkle on them and they do shed little reflective bits on you.  If you don't like that then these may not be for you.  It isn't an issue for me.  Overall, these are well made and fun to wear.  You do get a lot of them, 2 dozen, which I think is reasonable for this price point."
4.0,"The robe is very comfortable and attractive.  However, I had to shorten it about 7 inches.  I would definitely recommend it."
4.0,I was excited that it came in! Fits as expected and is really comfy.
4.0,Smaller than I thought they would be
4.0,"These are fun!  Cute stacking rings, but I wish the sizes varied SLIGHTLY so that they were able to stack with space between.  Just a personal preference though."
4.0,Not at all comfortable. Not cotton or any other soft material.
4.0,"They are very nice and comfortable, but the 6.5 it's a bit small, and the 7 it's too big to me!"
4.0,"Runs small, comfy for and not see through"
4.0,Very pretty....feels good on. Took off one star because bracelet runs large. I ordered smallest and it is definitely too big.
4.0,"It's a little smaller than expected, I assumed it would be more loose on the back. The shirt overall is still very cute and I can't wait for it to warm up so I can wear it out and about:)"
4.0,"the material is comfort, light.<br />I am a 190 cm tall and 103 Kg weight. I am thinner from hips and below<br />I bought the size according to the chart but it fitted on me a little bit loose, I recommend to use the size chart and order one size smaller."
4.0,"The fabric is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a small and the chest area is a tad loose. I weigh 130 lbs, 5'4, and wear a 34C. Just like some of the other reviews, be easy on the buttons because they snag easily. All in all, love the dress. Will probably need to have the chest/rib area taken in a little bit."
4.0,They fit well and we’re comfortable
4.0,Only one c rain 4 stars  the top is not as tight in boob area as expected.  I will have vto wear sport bra underneath I prefer not to buy the fit!! The color I bought dusty rose!! Skirt great length.  I am double D'S and large booty. I am buying more! Dressy for living in the heart but cute to wear to the tiki var or in the court or golfing. So casual out and about or sports either
4.0,"This actually got well, but the material felt cheap.  I looked like a lampshade.  There wasn’t anything wrong with the dress, but wearing it felt wrong."
4.0,Cutest shirt ever. Unfortunately my son chewed on the bow tie and the color bled all over the shirt so I had to toss it after one day of wearing it. Otherwise it was perfect.
4.0,It's a great watch for the price...
4.0,I think this is based off asian sizes
4.0,"i ORDERED A SIZE BIGGER THEN WHAT WHAT DAUGHTER IS, SHE IS A 5-6 AND I ORDERED A 7-8 AND IT FITS HER PERFECTLY. EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED EXCEPT THE WING WAS TORN IN THE MIDDLE NOTHING GLUE COULDN'T FIX, OVERALL HAPPY."
4.0,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this jacket, but it will serve the purpose I bought it for. It fits fine."
4.0,Soft<br />Good quality
4.0,"The only reason I'm taking away one star is because the material is thinner than I expected, other than that, it fits great! I am 5 2, 145 lbs and got a small. Its not tight around the waist, it's a looser fit. I shows a significant amount of back, so if you're not into that, look for another workout shirt."
4.0,"This crossbody bag is almost perfect.  It is lightweight and has readily and easily accessible areas for credit card, cash, and other items.  The zipper pouch is perfect for important items.  The only flaw is the outer pocket.  The first time I used it, the pocket ripped down the side.  I is still usable, but  I was hoping to use it for my cell phone, which fits easily into the amply sized pocket, but now I can only use it for glasses."
4.0,Warm & fits well. Good materials with a nice lining
4.0,"I purchased this for my wife, she LOVES it! Not only does she find it sexy, but she can tell all the eyes she catches! This product is well made."
4.0,"Very nice for the price, no support whatsoever. However, for the price point it was worth it."
4.0,"It's a descent dress. Seems to be made of spandex and nylon... super stretch and shows every curve bump and dimple you may have. I'm 5,4&#34;/145lbs normally wear a size 6 however I ordered this dress in an XL and it fit great. Also the back is cut out. Did not realize that either prior to purchase. I would recommend going 2 sizes up unless you want it to fit like a 2nd skin"
4.0,Like the look and feel. But it's a little tight and shorter than I expected. It only covered my forearm. Wish it went past my elbow.
4.0,Nice color a little small.
4.0,"Very nice, better than a home made version by far. I wish the shoulder pieces where sewn on, it would be a lot nicer, but I can do that myself. Really awesome altogether, and the belt just adds a whole nother layer of greatness. My only problem is the straps aren't attached, even by Velcro. They keep falling off and are hard to place right."
4.0,Nice but It is hurting my hand.
4.0,Normal for electrical work
4.0,"Loved it when I saw it, the barbell was just too short for me and irritated my piercing and had to take it out. Thankfully the balls screwed right onto another bar I had."
4.0,I love this scarf and have given one of them as a gift to many people.  It is so soft and so warm.
4.0,Gave these to my son for his birthday.  He really likes them.
4.0,"I am very impressed with this hat! For the price I didn't have high expectations. The hat came in a bag and was folded?! But it punched out perfectly and is adorable. Fits great, looks great, and the price was great!"
4.0,Cute bracelet.  Wasn't expecting amazing quality for the price but I was pretty happy overall...
4.0,I like the purchase; nice quality.  Odd smell though that is lasting a few days longer than I expected.
4.0,Don't like the filter pocket great mask and protection
4.0,Very comfortable shirt. Looks like the image posted and I did buy one size larger for a loose fit.
4.0,Super basic no-frills high waisted underwear. These sit higher on my waist than I’m used to so I ended up giving them to a friend and she likes them a lot. If you’re looking for basic high waisted underwear these check all the boxes.
4.0,"It is very pretty and attractive and you get a lot for your money. However, you'll have to wear another mask under it for virus protection."
4.0,"Of the 40, there were 13 that did not work, but the seller quickly replaced those"
4.0,"Cute top, fits a little snug in the chest so order a size up if you are busty at all. I would order again in different colors-I have the Burgundy."
4.0,Looked really frumpy. Was expected more of a royal blue underneath and tie but came as dark blue.
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised! Gained some weight due to an injury & was searching for a tummy control suit, but not wanting to pay $160+.  I liked this style and for some reason took a chance.  It's pretty darn flattering!  Made well, nice fabric, exceptional style.  Not as firm as a Miraclesuit, but certainly worth $25 measly bucks! Sizes are accurate.  I would be willing to order another by this brand.  (This high-neck style is a little wonky under certain cover ups.)"
4.0,Cute gift for a daughter or girlfriend. I bought this for my girlfriend who really likes turtles and she loved it. Quality of the product is above average considering the price and it certainly does not look cheap.
4.0,The color was right on. The fit was good. But the weight was lighter than expected. Was hoping to use as a stand alone outer layer in moderate cool weather without a windbreaker or jacket. This sweatshirt did not meet that expectation.
4.0,Nice backside coverage but the waist is a bit snug. I'm 5'3 and 120lb
4.0,"I purchased this dress. It fits my body well, other than my US 32DD chest. If I lift my arms, the material gathers above my chest, making a few wrinkles that are unsightly at best. This can be adjusted manually, but it won't go back on it's own. It also gathers under my chest once I adjust it, making an excessive amount of wrinkles. The last thing I want is to draw attention to my chest.<br />Other than that, though, the dress fits well."
4.0,Belt
4.0,"I had a very different experience with this scarf than the previous reviewer. I've had this scarf for over a month and I am very happy with my purchase.<br />I have sensitive eczema-prone skin, and I find the scarf to be relatively soft and non-irritating. It is also good sized and fairly warm. Exactly what I need to keep my neck (and sometimes face) warm during the chilly northeastern winter."
4.0,"I love it!!! It's a little big, but it will allow me to wear some layers under it. Very happy!"
4.0,"cute, a little baggy in the pockets."
4.0,"These are cushioned bottom socks, with an airy type mesh top. They are really nice for wearing with tennis shoes."
4.0,The  Bust is too small otherwise fits great!
4.0,Inexpensive and cute! It came fast.
4.0,"These no show socks were well worth the money! I was able to get 12 pairs of socks (and an additional bonus pair) for less than $13 (including shipping)! The socks fit great and are breathable. I've noticed that the elastic in certain pairs of the socks are tight and can squeeze your Achilles tendon after wearing the socks for more than 4 hours. Also, the socks pill on the bottom and sides. I have one pair that has a tiny hole in the toe after wearing it countless times. Other than that, the socks were just what I had in mind!"
4.0,"Cheapest quality plugs i've ever owned but I bought them because after giving birth to my son, I couldn't have plugs falling out of my ears that he might find and try to swallow. These are lightweight and they never come out unless you deliberately remove them. They also don't seem to build up much ""ear cheese"" at all. They don't fall apart or dry out and crumble amd I have had no allergic reactions. Lol works for me!"
4.0,"I liked the shirt with its contrasting zipper, but I had to return it because it ran small."
4.0,"This band is a great fit for the Alta HR.  I have worn it everyday for the past three months and have had no problems with it.  The band is strong, but not too stiff."
4.0,Gorgeous earrings! They are smaller than I expected but beautiful! I am not disappointed they just appeared larger in the photo.
4.0,Best suit for several practices per week
4.0,"This belt comes rolled in a small, sturdy box that's great for gift-wrapping.  It appears to be good quality for the price.  I'll be giving it to my father this Christmas."
4.0,"Pros:<br />Clever design<br />Clear view<br />Very compact<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not fully protected when closed<br /><br />These are excellent for storing in slim spaces. E.g. they fit great into a very narrow space inside my camera bag. Other styles would have never fit in this space.<br /><br />Understand that you do sacrifice comfort (no nose pads & a narrow lens) for the slim profile of these. You probably would not want to wear these for reading hours at a time, but they are perfect for packing into small spaces for when you need them on the go.<br /><br />Because they are not fully protected, they may not be the best choice for a tightly filled backpack.<br /><br />Even though they have no nose pads, they stay put reasonably well."
4.0,"Had to send back, was too small otherwise cute PJs"
4.0,"The shirts are both great. The blue tank is significantly darker than pictured, so I swapped it out with a lighter tank for cosplay, but the shirt itself is really nice and I plan to wear it in regular life."
4.0,"This product sticks well on the felt hats I bought and does what it's designed to do.  Only reason I deducted one star is because, after the first cut, it's hard to peel backing off. I did manage, however!"
4.0,I really loved that the colors were the same as pictured<br />The shirt is thin but I don’t mind that at all<br />The shorts were longer then expected but I did order one size up<br />Over all super happy with this purchase
4.0,I like the design but the elastic around the legs was loose! Otherwise it fit well!
4.0,Very cute but runs a little small and it's not as log as posted.
4.0,"Would be a really nice winter coat (in Florida anyways) if the fit wasn't so odd. It was really short in terms of length, with sleeves that were a little too long and a chest that was very loose. Comfortable, but just didn't fit right for me. I'm 5'11 and a little chubby."
4.0,Fit is really good!.  Quality is better then I expect also.  Think I can dress it up or down.
4.0,"Comfy for a baby, can bu used all day, only thing I dislike is the neck it does no cover babies neck and portion of the chestm will be 5 start of they add something like botones or something to tight in the back"
4.0,I love the color and fit. Only thing is the pockets do not stay in.
4.0,"I'm 135 Lbs at 5'6&#34;, I went with an XS as my preferred fit. Small was a bit too loose for me.<br /><br />I have to say, for the price, it's not a bad jacket. The inner fleece lining and wind proofing makes this a very good jacket for cold weather. With proper layering, it'll keep you comfortable at nearly freezing temperature  (as I've experienced). The outside material seems pretty durable for a softshell jacket, and I'd say that it's waterproof.<br /><br />However, the zippers used in this jacket are not waterproof. I haven't had the benefit of seeing if this will be a bothersome issue (my main concern is water coming through the zippers at the underarms). I did however, test my jacket by hanging it up, and aggressively spraying it with water for about 30 seconds; the inside remained dry. When I targeted the zippers with the water spray, water did seep through. I don't think dripping rainwater will come through the zippers, but I'll be sure to update this review if anything comes up. Hope this review helps!"
4.0,They look nice but only 4 pairs are wood but my biggest issue is I ordered a size 0 and there to small. I've compared them to other size 0 plugs and they are deff smaller. So I would suggest ordering a size up maybe. I'm going to try to return these and order a 00 to see if sizing is better.
4.0,"It only gets 4 stars because it's undersized.  I usually wear a size 4-6, small-medium; I ordered large and it's on the small side for me. But it is very very pretty!!"
4.0,I love the shirt but it's not as form fitting as it looks in the picture. It's more flowey at the bottom. I took in the inseams an inch or so toward the bottom to make it fit tighter.
4.0,"Somewhat small, but great material, very light and comfortable, yet blocks out wind."
4.0,"They came early, but I am able to give them to my sister for her birthday."
4.0,"I love it, but keep in mind the size chart when ordering this item."
4.0,I got this bag for my mother as a Christmas gift. I figured it would be a great bag for her because of her humor. The bag seems like a good quality nice and large seems like it should be able to hold a few packages of yarn and whatever portion of blanket\scarf that is being worked on.  The only issue I had was the print on the bag. In the picture it looks very bright and stands out but it was very light and not good quality. Kinda bummed about it but at least you can still see what it says. If I knew it was like that I probably would not have purchased it. Will try and attach a picture once she opens it because I already wrapped it and forgot to take a picture first.
4.0,"I’m not sure I would consider these compression tanks, but I kept them because they fit and they’re pretty comfortable."
4.0,Me and the headband game are not friends but this one actually stays for the most part and I can pull off
4.0,"Comfortable but walking outside speakers constantly cut in and out, going into store work great but want them for walking the dogs"
4.0,"Wanted it for traveling, being able to hang around my neck rather than holding it.  Looks nice enough I'm going to try it for everyday use.<br />Bad thing is the leather tassels.  They're awful and there are five of them.  I don't know why designers think we like big tassels hanging from our purses, wallets, etc.  An attractive small zipper pull is so much better.  I'm going to look at pulls to replace them."
4.0,"This is a nice wrap and I do like it, however, it runs small. I'm not a big person (160 pounds at 5' 4"") and even tho I ordered a much larger size than I normally wear, it's still snug across the bust."
4.0,Looks amazing but the hole for the button was closed and I had to open it myself lmao but they look amazing.
4.0,"Ordered medium, isn’t compression like. I like the fit though."
4.0,it came a little bigger than i expected..i .plan on getting a smaller size.
4.0,Its a light wt (I was concern it would be a heavy material) soft flannel which I was looking for.  The color orange is not bright but nice looking.  I wear it all the time.
4.0,I love these and wear them to work every night.  I will be purchasing more!
4.0,Tried it on really cute
4.0,It fit fine. The shirt just didn't look good on me.
4.0,I like the way they looked although they fit too tight.
4.0,The skirt fits really good. The top is a little small.. I’m a 36 D... I’m 5’1 180lbs.. the material is stretchy and the color is very good.. if your beast is bigger than the size I wrote above I would suggest going the next size up on this outfit
4.0,"I loved this Tankini. The fabric felt very smooth against my skin and I really liked the color choices not to mention the amazing price. However, this Tankini is not for people like me who have long torsos and want the top to actually meet the bottom."
4.0,"a bit too small across the bust, but not awful.  I get a lot of compliments on this dress."
4.0,I like it. Fits perfectly. I got multiple compliments the first time I wore it. Only complaint is there is a gap between the buttons in my chest area but I guess that’s not a problem women with smaller chests will have. I bought it in two colors though.
4.0,"This jeans were what I was looking for but because of the fleece lining, I should have ordered a larger size. They were warm and flattering but not as comfortable as I would have liked. I donated these jeans to a homeless shelter. Next time I buy a pair of lined jeans, I will definitely purchase one size up."
4.0,Very pretty and dainty. I like the silver colored border around the little pearl.<br />The ‘shaft’ of the earring is nice and long(approx. 1/2 inch) but the metal is soft and bends easy. Hope it doesn’t break off!
4.0,"size runs small, when ordering get the next size bigger. Other than that they are well made and they seem to be good quality."
4.0,It is really pretty. Runs small so may want to size up.
4.0,"Excellent product.  Exceeds expectations!<br />  HOWEVER:<br />There are clear instructions, including a box for deliveries outside the front door.<br />The delivery person just threw the package to a wet and dirty part of the front porch. Awful!<br />The package was not discovered for a long while and could have been discarded as thrash..."
4.0,Very pleased with the product.  It looked even better in person than it did on your website.
4.0,"This is a really cute cardigan. I am petite, so the cropped length is the perfect proportion for me. I would have liked a size Medium but they were sold out. I am a size 2 and found the size Small to be a tad snug but still wearable. I have to wear the cardigan unbuttoned because the fabric strained around the buttons when I tried button it."
4.0,very nice.just what I was looking for.
4.0,"I thought they would be darker. Overall, they are very good."
4.0,I was thinking they were going to be straight leg and they are boot cut.  Not crazy about boot cut but I will keep them.  The picture is straight leg. I need to read the description more carefully next time!
4.0,"Absolute beautiful. It's a little heavy but that's to be expected. Docked one star off because a stud fell out on its first night of use, but I'll be hot glueing that back in. This is too gorgeous to return!"
4.0,Product came in the time specified and was as expected.  I purchased it as a gift so I hope the person will like it as much as I do.
4.0,This product could use a little more instruction on pairing.
4.0,Very pretty and nice material. A bit on the small side.  Would order one size up.
4.0,Fabric moves with your body.  Comfortable.
4.0,"this bell is nice and I like the sound, the only thing wrong is that it is too big to put on a chain, I put it on a bracelet because there sounds better when you walk, but it looks to big."
4.0,"Kind of disappointed I paid $15 for this. I'm 5'8&#34; and about a 40-37-41. Roughly a size 10/12 (depends on the store as always). I ordered an the largest size, an XL.<br /><br />It's a shirt if you lift your arms, and barely gets by as a dress with your arms down. The arms are tight too. But, even with my little belly, it doesn't look bad. I wish I had paid closer to $11 for this since it's not as versatile as I had hoped for. The biggest issue (aside from it barely fitting), is that it's just too short."
4.0,"XL was a little small for my husband who usually wears an XL, needed an XXL"
4.0,They ok. I like the style.
4.0,It's super cute and can't wait to wear it! I got a 6 and it's a little tight around my ribs only cause I do work out and my back is bigger. I should've went with an 8 which is my dress size but over it still fits!
4.0,This bathing suit is cute.  The top is tank top like and has a bikini bra underneath it.  The tank top portion is loose so it is not skin tight.  Your skin shows a tad bit on the sides.  It is cute and I feel comfortable in it where I do not feel comfortable in bikinis.  The color is exactly like the picture navy blue.  The bathing suit is good quality.  I feel that the suit is a little small for a medium.
4.0,Great price for three watches. I love not having anything on my wrist - both for comfort and for cleanliness.
4.0,"so far they are comfortable, but they could use a bit more padding"
4.0,"I personally love it. It's unique but not weird. The tulle is light and soft, not scratchy and stiff like some can be. The petals aren't sewn on, so there is one spot where one came off, but I think it can be fixed easily. The edges could use a little finishing, but it's a great deal for as inexpensive as it is!"
4.0,Very comfy and fit just right love the material
4.0,"Nice set, pieces have a little weight"
4.0,"This is a great product so far.  The dragon is fantastic looking, even better than the picture online.  It's got good weight and the eyelet seems securely attached, although I have only been wearing this for a few days.  It comes with a chain (rather flimsy so I tossed it) - I bought the 20&#34; Bico braided leather necklace (which is excellent!) and wear it with that.  The eyelet on the dragon is large enough to fit probably most any necklace with average clasp.  I am pretty happy with this so far and again better than I expected.  I am male and have dragon tats.  So, this necklace pretty much matches me."
4.0,"Love this dress. Fit as expected, flattering and comfy!"
4.0,Great glasses for the price. That look good on my narrow face.
4.0,Beautiful colors and very stunning!
4.0,I think their great
4.0,I buyed this item recently..very good..wen I wear it it was so modern as well as traditional..very gud product..but one thing is one bead in this chain it was little broken black bead..but anyway it was weightless very gud item..very satisfied
4.0,I like that these socks are thin sock but warm! A good buy for sure!
4.0,"Sleeves are shorter on these, than on the same ones in black and gray."
4.0,I like that it fit just right. With our current situation staying home. It will help me working at home as well.
4.0,I needed a few pieces to finish up my clowning outfit and this hat fit the bill nicely.  Material is a bit thin but the price is right. I expect it will suit my needs for some time before I have to replace it.
4.0,"I did have a little difficulty getting one of the bands off and on, BUT overall amazing product for the price! Thank you!"
4.0,I think 🤔 it’s a different manufacturer than my usual purchases and run a little small.  It fits.  I just usually prefer whatever I wear to be a little loose.
4.0,They appear to made well.  I haven't gotten to use them yet.  They seem to be pretty warm.  Fit is as expected.
4.0,His friends all liked how real the mask looked he had one complaint about the pinky part of the gloves though they seemed  too tight to fit his pinky’s into them .
4.0,"The regular hoops work great, they're a little wide, so I have to bend them to get them to close a bit more.<br />The hoops with the jewel on them are a good idea in theory, but in practice, not so much."
4.0,Arrived in few days. Was exactly as I expected. I would purchase others from this seller. Was very please.
4.0,"Really thin. it had a elastic band that you tighten that wraps around your face, I removed it due to it being horribly uncomfortable."
4.0,"Just received and tried these today. They feel very high quality and are stylish. Not to mention they look great.<br /><br />Material is similar to DrSkin's compression pants but slightly more high quality feel and slightly more comfy<br /><br />Two nitpicks that lose half star each<br />- 1) the waistband has this kind of sticky/stiff material, mabye it's supposed to help keep the pants up and not sag but it is a bit uncomfortable and you have to be careful not to stretch it out too much when putting the pants on or I presume it will lose its stretch.<br />- 2) EXPENSIVE., holy cow. I mean you get what you pay for generally but the price is a bit steep. I could stomach a price 2x Dr Skin's but 2.75 times other competitor's prices for almost the same pants is a bit much for me<br /><br />Still, if you have the money, these are awesome."
4.0,"The dress is as it looks in pictures. It was surprisingly quality fabric. Took a while to get shipped to me, but will keep."
4.0,Longer than expected but I like.
4.0,Ordered another size and it fits. I like it.
4.0,These sunglasses are worth the money<br />Pros:<br />Lightweight<br />Fit snug but not tight<br />Attractive on the face<br />Cute arms<br />Nice amber tinted lenses<br /><br />Con:<br />I get a little bit of glare on the outer edges of the lenses
4.0,"These are adorable! My 3 year old loves them! They are lightweight & comfortable, so cute!"
4.0,"Bought them for wife. She loves them, but if they are pulled all the way up the child looks a bit silly. She scrunches then down and they look fine."
4.0,"There are a couple of things I really like about these shorts. One is that they are very thin and the material is breathable. Out of some necessity, for compression, most shapewear is thick. These shorts are also truly seamless. The silicone band at the top means that it did not roll down, no matter how much I bent and twisted. I did have an issue with the thighs coming up, so maybe more silicone bands added around the legs just above the lace would help with that? Not sure how that would affect the seamlessness of it though.<br /><br />Unfortunately, and probably because of the sheerness of the material, I did not find this to be as controlling as other types of shapewear. I would find this useful for some outfits, but not for others. It would just depend on how the outfit in question fits. So while it has its perks, it doesn't really do the job it was intended for for me, and I probably wouldn't purchase these again."
4.0,"This shirt is very cute! The material is extremely soft. The shirt is more fitted, so if you don't like a tee to be super tight, then I recommend sizing up 1 size. For reference, I'm 5'3"" and approx 165 lbs with a heavy chest. I ordered a large, but a XL would be more suitable. Giving 4 stars because I feel like the vendor should give thorough washing and drying instructions. I used to press my own tees and the vinyl on this shirt feels identical to the kind I used to use. Shirt will likely last longer if washed on cold and either hang dry or dry on air setting only."
4.0,"The skirt is a very nice material and I love it soooooo much but sadly I have to return it because it is a bit too small. I would like to do like an exchange though, but I’m not sure if it is possible?"
4.0,The fabric seems to be thinner than it appears and doesn't seem to keep warm very well.  Actual coat seems well made though.
4.0,this was a beautiful necklace.<br />the aarowhead looks so perfect.<br />i took off a start because the chain broke after wearing this twice :(
4.0,"Had a little bit of trouble with the zippers, they seem to want to get stuck"
4.0,Bag is big. Hold a lot. The shoulder straps are nice and wide making comfy to carry.  There is plenty if pockets in the bag to carry items. Nice it came with a cover to keep rain out.
4.0,Good sunglasses. Sturdy. Hard to clean though. Did not come with a cleaning cloth.
4.0,"The material isn’t as nice as I would hope, but it looked good."
4.0,Larger than expected frame style but liked
4.0,Good price and product
4.0,"So far so good , maybe a little narrow .. material a bit stiff especially when cold .. but overall good.. time will tell !!!"
4.0,"If you are looking for a &#34;barely there&#34; suit, you will be happy. I ordered a M, and I'm 5'7&#34; and 125--and a mom, and there's no way I could wear this in public."
4.0,Soft and heavy
4.0,"I really like the style of this bracelet and enamel bead hides the clasp. It's a little hard to open, but wouldn't want it to get loose when wearing"
4.0,"I bought this to replace a fake furry tail I had been using that just kind of wore out. I like being able to reach into my purse and feel for my keys instead of having to do a visual search. This tail is long, but not very thick. Still it winds around enough inside my purse that I can usually reach in and grab my keys pretty quickly."
4.0,Has a nice weight to it and has held up being worn daily.
4.0,Great product for the price. I've gotten compliments and people expect it to be more expensive than it was.
4.0,"Great shorts, especially for the price. Kids love them, these are their second pair."
4.0,The hats are Christmas gifts. I am sure they will be liked.
4.0,"Great suit for the price.  It is teeny tiny, but perfect for an exotic beach vacation."
4.0,"This is an adorable print shirt and I really like it except for one thing. I have a large bust and the sewing at the neckline bulges out a bit. It's more annoying than anything else, I don't think anyone besides me notices."
4.0,"really nice looking necklace for the price,My wife absolutely loved it for mothers day.I wish the chain was a little more sturdy."
4.0,Made for a great Christmas gift!! Super nice quality and seems durable
4.0,Me gustó mucho queda prefecto en el cuello.
4.0,Very pretty but runs small on the top and the sleeves were tight. I’d size up one size.
4.0,"A little bit on the small side, but very comfy."
4.0,"As other reviewers wrote, the sizing runs small.  I ordered a large even though I wear a small to medium top.  Overall the size was still too small."
4.0,Great  work out  shirt fits nice and comfortable
4.0,Very unique and stylish
4.0,Cheap material but still looks cute
4.0,"Nice linen, not too thin/thick. I let the cuff down by releasing the six stitches - three per leg - that created the cuff thereby adding an inch to the length = better for me. They run a little small. I normally wear an 8 or M, but had to return the M for a L in these. (A nuisance if you don't have Prime.)"
4.0,Soft and easy to care for.
4.0,I got the pink shirt (which is quite peachy colored) in a large compared to a medium to have it oversized and it fits exactly like I wanted. The design is vibrant and seems to be made of a nice material. My only problem is that the shirt is quite thin. Otherwise I think it's great!
4.0,Once it's up and open it seems a little bit less sturdy than I was expecting. I have 300lbs holding the base down so we will see how well it holds up in the south Texas heat. I put it over my grilling station in my back yard.
4.0,Bought this for my niece and she loved it. Nice and durable. Came a little squished in box but other than that great hat!
4.0,Dont like that it is a thin shirt
4.0,"Better than expected. A little on the short side for me, I’m tall, about 5’8’ but I am happy it’s exactly what I was looking for. Nothing heavily knitted but this type of fabric. Came on time and in good shape."
4.0,Kind of a cheap material but looks good and fits great!
4.0,"I probably should have gotten a smaller size, I bought a small and I am 5'7&#34; and about 115-120 lbs. It looked like a nightgown on me, according to my husband. I am returning it and I might get a smaller size. I love the sleeves and the dress would be perfect if it just was smaller."
4.0,Fits TTS very well made comfortable..the only improvement would be the draw strings to be shorter
4.0,Soft touch material 👍
4.0,Fit well. The material is a little thin and extra stretchy but I didn’t expect anything else. I ordered a size too large but got it adjusted and I’m quite ok with it.
4.0,I love this dress. It is cool and comfortable. I have narrow shoulders so I had to have the straps shortened but this is typical for any spaghetti strap I use. I received tons of compliments and can’t wIt to wear it again. I got it for a luau and it worked perfect.
4.0,"I love this shirt... It pays homage to my favorite Halloween movie, it's soft, comfy... Only issue  is that the print is kinda hard, like a paper feel... I've probably written/washed it a ridden times now and there's no fading on shirt or print, but my concern is that the print will get harder or crack or something... It's just weird<br /><br />But I'd still definitely recommend getting the shirt."
4.0,I loveed the fact that it actually came BEFORE Christmas despite the fact that I ordered this a few days ago and I have other items that were ordered a week ago and still not here. Also the item looked as it did on the description as by fiancé has a muscular build and normally wears a large but thanks to me reading the other reviews I bought a size up (XL) and it fits perfect!!!
4.0,It is overall a very cute wrap. The colors are beautiful and vibrant. It runs a little small around the hips/waist area. The fabric is pieced together so a big portion of the flamingos are upside down.
4.0,"Overall I like the dress, it’s a little thin but I wear a Kimono over it so it works well."
4.0,This boot is very comfortable.
4.0,"I got the 2g size. They are a little bit longer than they should be, but the gauge itself is perfect and I didn’t need to stretch my ears to get them in, nor do they feel like they will fall out on their own. The honeycomb design is cute!"
4.0,Super cute. Sort of cheap material. My daughter is almost 9 months old  Got 6-12m and it is way too big. The pants are WAY too long and my daughter has longer legs than most babies her age. She will definitely wear it when she fits in it better.
4.0,the set is beautiful but arrived broken.
4.0,Very comfortable material and fits as expected. Can be dressed up or worn casually. Great buy!
4.0,A nice back up umbrella. It is a bit flimsy so if you live in an area with strong winds this isn't for you. Overall gets the job done.
4.0,Have received lots of compliments. It's cute.
4.0,"Women's short kimono sleeve loose fit long tunic top.  This top is made of rayon and spandex.  It is machine washable with cold water.  It can be tumble dried.  This shirt is trendy and elegant and suitable for casual wear or you can dress it up.  The fabric is stretchy and soft.  The long length helps to cover hips.  It can be paired with jeans, leggins, etc.  This tunic top arrived on time and was folded in a clear bag package.  It is very soft and stretchy feeling.  I ordered an xxxl expecting the sizing to run small.  They do run small but xxxl is more of an xl in my opinion(I've ordered shirts where xxxl is a m so this is fine).  I should have settled with an XL.  However, the fact that it is stretchy and flows is great.  I think it could stretch to fit if I ordered too small of a size.  I don't have that problem as it is slightly too big but that can be fixed.  It can be paired with a belt and be pretty.  It is a nice shirt and I think it's very versatile.  I could wear it with leggings or yoga pants and casually run errands and be comfortable.  I could put a belt around it and pair it with nice black pants or a skirt and dress up.  I actually prefer that it is loose and too big on me.  It's comfortable.  It washed well and didn't shrink much.  Overall I like this shirt.  Check the sizing.  It runs a size or two smaller.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount.  The only requirement was that I give an honest review.  There is no reward for a positive review and no punishment for a negative review.  This was my honest opinion of the product.  I only accept a free or discounted product if I or my family will use the item and want the item.  I know that I rely on other reviews prior to purchasing an item and I hope that you found this review helpful."
4.0,Very cute and sturdy. The only thing I disliked was how the earrings left a mark on my toddlers ear making it a little uncomfortable. She used it more for costume play than anything else
4.0,Even though it was really on the light side it still worked on my crystal grid!
4.0,"I wear a 6 in almost everything. When the 6 arrived I couldn’t even get it over my arms. A lot of other people had the same issue by reading the comments. I loved the dress and reorder on an 8 and a 10 (determined I was going to have this dress). The 10 fit great. I’m 5’6”, 155lbs, athletic build. If you don’t have really small arms,, order 2 sizes up and it fits great! The back of the dress is beautiful!"
4.0,"These pants are very comfy for wearing around the house. They’re a little thicker than expected and the pockets are a little shallow, both of which take away from their wearability as shorts for wearing out and about, but don’t detract from their comfort as house shorts."
4.0,"Bought this umbrella knowing that I was going to an event where it would be raining.  It is very cute and a good size, but unfortunately, it leaked a little from the top of the umbrella onto my hair."
4.0,Fit is a bit large
4.0,"There nice but too thin for me. So, I returned them."
4.0,Gift for my father who was happy with how thick and warm it is
4.0,"I am about a size 12-14 in tops and ordered the size XXL in this top after reading the other reviews.  It's a decent shirt for the price, but it is a bit too roomy for my taste.  I don't like tight tops and the upper part of this and the sleeves fit nicely, but down at the blouson, banded waistband is just too big.  There is just too much material so it makes me look larger instead of covering up my problem areas in a way that doesn't make me look huge from the side."
4.0,I paid for 60 as advertised and only got 10.  There was a shipping mistake. I reached out to the seller and received a refund for the missing masks.  The masks are cute and my son loves them.  I wish we would have got all 60 but I am glad for the quick response from the seller.
4.0,"The bag is a convenient size for carrying my work equipment. It fits everything has a little bit of room left to carry extra like water and snacks. The downside of the bag is that the quality doesn't seem too good. The pad on the strap is falling apart and the bag is starting to fray and fuzz from movement while carrying it. Other than that. Still a very good bag.<br /><br />Update: bag is still holding strong to this day. The straps insist to keep the bag closer to my waist but of course with movement, the strap slackens and moves back down to a lower setting. Not a deal breaker. The padding on the strap became so tattered that I just ripped it off the strap. The use of the strap is still comfortable without the padding. Still a great bag and I might buy a second one."
4.0,"Very cute and worth the price.  This is really adorable and very, very cheap.  Don't expect a lot for the price but it is a cute piece."
4.0,The chain was a little to long. Always getting caught on things. Other wise it is a good by.
4.0,I love vintage looks and this pillbox hat is perfection. The shape is nice and arrived in perfect condition. I would have given 5 stars except the pictures clearly show the veil coming down in front of the model's eyes and my veil only just covers the hat. It is a nit picky thing that wouldn't even been an issue had I not thought the veil to be longer.
4.0,Tail is not long enough.
4.0,I was mad at first when I saw the bag said disposable then I went to see that I bought the right thing and I guess the manufacturer put them in the wrong bag. Ok that’s fine. My big issue is that it doesn’t fit snugly around your nose which makes me wonder how much purpose they serve. It doesn’t have the wire in it. That’s a big bummer. They will do for now but I’ll look for something else with more functionality. At least it’s comfortable?
4.0,"I workout every day. this band is very comfortable, easy to take on and off and adjustable for my comfort level."
4.0,"Love these, I bought the Heather charcoal color, and they're pretty good! Not see-through or anything. They give me a slight muffin top, but I think it's because they're a teeny bit more snug up top as so they don't slide down during activities. Other than that, they fit perfect, although a tad bit more snug than usual, while still fitting nice and comfortable. (I bought an XL, and I'm size 18 in most pants, 37&#34; waist, 41&#34; hips) Perfect capri length for me, as I don't really like how the other capri styles kinda stop right below the knee. These stop about mid calf, maybe a little longer if I stretch them full length, which I really like. Very comfortable. I just bought my 2nd pair in the black color! 👍"
4.0,"Nice dress, well put together, however if you weigh anything between 150 to 165 I would recommend you order a large and not medium ..that's if you want room in the dress if you light it tight and revealing then stick to the medium. Am 5ft 8"" as well and it stop about 2inches above my knee that's someone short for me."
4.0,I really like this shirt.  It does the important things like cover bra straps and skim the less favorable parts of my anatomy (read: belly).  My only reason for knocking it down a star is that the fabric is a bit heavier than I anticipated.  I'll still wear it all the time but it feels more heavy than light.
4.0,Very pretty!  Looks great on me.  I would definitely purchase this necklace again.  No chips... breaks and still the same color.
4.0,Very nice seems like good quality
4.0,better than others that i have tried
4.0,Love the fabric and the fit. Arrived on time.
4.0,"Basic but does not look cheap, multi-purpose hat!!"
4.0,"I love Harry Potter!!! Now when i saw these I was skeptical, when i received them I found that after put them in I found the front looked kind of small. I only have a 00, I think it's more of a preference for me to have them look bigger. I will keep them because I'm a huge HP fan. But I'll probably never wear them."
4.0,"Pleasantly surprised that it was cute, matched the picture, and comfortable. I rarely buy clothing, especially bra's through amazon because usually they end up being crap, not true to size, etc.<br />Not this bra though! It's super cute and comfortable!"
4.0,"Nice hat,fits good! Black is faded in areas like it’s been sitting in a storeroom for a while,but nice overall"
4.0,I didn't like the colors or the ribbon tie.  It ran a little small.  Overall a cute dress.
4.0,"Follow the measurement guidelines! Pull out the tape measure and scale. I subtracted a star because I think the leg length could be a touch longer and that the front panel could be a little bit less material. Otherwise, our girl is super happy with the pattern."
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; 145lbs. usually wear a large but since the other reviews said it runs small, I bought an XL. Should have gotten the L."
4.0,I really like this piece and think it was most definitely worth the price! It's something that would sell here for 5 times as much. Very versatile and classy looking
4.0,Great value for price...washed it twice and no pilling so far!!!!
4.0,"This purse is a little small for me, but I kept it because of the color, quality, and flair!  I have used this purse several times when all I needed was a place for my phone, cards, and cash."
4.0,"Based on the reviews I ordered an XL. I'm 5'5&#34; 36-27-42 and my shoulders are kinda broad. It doesn't fit as big as I prefer (too snug on the shoulders), but I expected it. Definitely is not as loose as the picture. I've washed it a few times and I can't really tell if it's really dark blue or black. I don't really care for chiffon kimonos, so this cotton-like fabric is really great! It's a great length, ending below my knees. Over all I would say that it's great for the price, but if you want it to fit like the picture you need to be way tiny!"
4.0,"I really like this belt.  The inside is not smooth like the outer part, but the outside is silky smooth.  It's a handsome belt, and the leather feels sturdy and of good quality.  I'm an in-between size when it comes to belts, and I often have difficulty figuring out which size is the best one for me to order, so I particularly like the way this belt adjusts -- I had no difficulty adjusting it to fit me well.  The only thing I don't like is the second belt loop.  Maybe it's meant to be a spare in the event the main belt loop is damaged or breaks, but if used on the belt as it comes, it's loose and can easily fall off."
4.0,Cinnamon Toast Ken brought me here :) I actually really like the quality and the softness of the hat and can't wait to show it off
4.0,Enjoyed these but they took awhile to get here.
4.0,Fits as described with typically loose yoga fit. Very comfy and lightweight. Great bargain!
4.0,"I wasn't to sure what to expect quality wise with the cost. I am pleasantly surprised at how large, soft and nice this scarf is. I like the design and colors, and the material is thinner so you can easily wear this all day without getting too hot. I cant really read what the letters are, but it is a really nice design, and colors that i can mix with everything. When it is open, I can wear on the shoulders like a shawl, or nice light blanket.  Thin enough to wear tied around my neck, and under a coat.  I am really happy with it, only downside is dry clean only is suggested. I will most likely be testing why that is, and hand washing only."
4.0,Love the dress but a bit tight on the chest. So tight it gets a little sheer and you can see all of bra outline. Otherwide love this dress and the pockets.
4.0,The fit was fine and there were no visibility issues.
4.0,Sweater doesn’t look like what is pictured.. it’s way shorter and the sleeves are a strange length. I’m going to keep it and will wear it but it’s a bit different than what I expected.
4.0,I like it very much although it is a little tight around my bossom. It just holds me up a bit more. I can wear it through the day but in the evening like a bra it's got to come off.
4.0,"This was super easy to use, and I had the batteries on hand, so it was working in about a minute. Please note- there is a cord that comes with it, BUT you have to have a USB wall port - there is not an actual AC outlet end. Since I'm using it in my baby's room I decided just to use the batteries and avoid a dangling cord. There's 3 lighting modes: soft white, bright white, and a rainbow/color changing option. We typically use the rainbow option and my 2 year old loves having it for his nightlight.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to use<br />Vibrant colors<br />Sturdy<br />Easy to clean<br />Baby Safe<br /><br />Cons:<br />No actual charging outlet - just essentially a mini-USB sync cable<br />Not always responsive, sometimes it takes 3-4 &#34;taps&#34; before the mode changes or it turns off."
4.0,This is a cute and comfortable tunic. The colors are great and it fits as expected.
4.0,"A little on the small side, but other than that great quality."
4.0,I honestly did not read the heading when I was ordering these chains. I thought the shoes were going to come along with it. But I think these chains are really cute and you can match them up with a nice pair of shoes.
4.0,"Looked nice, I'm not sure I trust the sizing chart. I ordered an XL and it was way too big on me. I'm busty, 34DDD, and it just didn't hold me in. Sadly, had to return, but it looked cute."
4.0,"Perfect princess shoes that go with our Sofia The First dress-up costume. The sizing seemed a little tricky when ordering—my child is wearing an 8T shoe (US size) which allows some growing room, so I went with the 9.5 in these because the size chart made me feel these would run small, and they do. The 9.5 size is wearable, but fits my child a little loosely so we have some growing room. Definitely order 1 size up for comfort. They also seem to run a bit narrow, so kids with wider feet may have trouble with these.<br /><br />The quality is nice for dress-up play or for a costume party, but not so much for actual shoes for long-term wear. They do have a PVC smell, so we’re airing them out right now. I don’t love the bronze-looking faux buttons on the straps. They kind of “jingle” a little bit, and look a little weathered. I’d actually prefer them without the button look, but they’re really cute otherwise, and the velcro strap makes them easy for kids."
4.0,"This bra fit like a traditional bra and had some padding and uplift support on the sides. It has a 3 hook closure and the hooks for releasing the front part of the bra to nurse are made of thick plastic. I was a little disappointed in the front support of the bra; it left me feeling like I was hanging out a bit and that it was a bit lower cut in the cleavage area than I generally like. The hooks for releasing the front flaps for nursing were easy to release even with one hand. The material was comfortable and the fit was about as expected. I wear a 40 C and I ordered the XL size. I really liked that it did not have underwire and I still felt supported. Although this is marketed as a sleep bra, I didn’t find that it was really a style bra I would care to sleep in. The padding and push up features seem more appropriate for work or daytime wear rather than to sleep in.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,This skirt is so cute! The band is a little tight but it’s very flattering.
4.0,It works better than expected. One must keep in mind that it is a polishing cloth and not a substitute for a liquid or cream cleaner.
4.0,Super cute just a little large
4.0,Boot is to narrow for my foot. Did not fit.
4.0,Great quality but I would advise that you order 1 size up
4.0,"I really like the color and the quality of the product, it doesn't bleed in the wash and I can wear it comfortably at home and while at work."
4.0,"The suit is really flattering, it tends to ride up a little but not enough to make me not like the suit."
4.0,Love the looks and feel of this band.  Looks great on my Timex Expedition Scout!
4.0,"Very cute shirt, good quality, but runs WAY too big. I ordered a small and it's loose and baggy on me and the sleeves are way too large."
4.0,"I do like this Dear-Lover Women's Color Block padded bikini.  It is made of very nice bathing suit material.  It is a very attractive looking swimsuit that has a sexy look to it.  I like that the straps are both adjustable.  The bikini top is very unique and has two sets of straps one that you hook on and the other that you tie.  Very cute!  I will admit unfortunately, the top was a little small for my breasts.  The bottoms fit my buttocks nicely, but I will admit the front does plug lower in the pubic area.  The only other little goofy thing is that in the front of the bottoms where the two different colors meet/crisscross, the material kind of peaks or tents outward and results in the area sticking out.  I have tried straightening the material, but it still continues to push out.  From the front you do not notice this, but from the side it is noticeable.  Maybe if I lost a little bit of weight this suit may fit me a little better, but not sure.  I did buy this swimsuit at a reduced price for an honest review and feel this is a very cute suit, but wonder if maybe I bought a bigger size it may have fit me a little better."
4.0,This is a nice shirt. It runs very small. I am normally a large but ordered a 2XL. Thankful that I did. The shirt is advertised as Legend No. 8 and No. 24. It is not. It was only #24.
4.0,"Very nice jacket, I ordered 2 sizes up based on reviews stating it runs small, they were right, order up! I likely could have just ordered one size up as this one is now roomy, but comfortable."
4.0,Love these shoes. They run a bit small but other than that they're completely comfortable and I've had five people ask me where they can buy a pair. I would definitely recommend.
4.0,Great quality although the armpits may be a little cutting.
4.0,"They do a very good job for me with softening glare from headlights while driving at night, and for polarizing."
4.0,"It's very pretty, nice & long!! It fits well, is comfy & washes well!!"
4.0,Super cool picture but poorly made
4.0,Great watch for the money. I love the blue face and looks very nice on my wrist. Thought the tach was just there for aesthetic purposes and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it actually works.  Only thing preventing me from rating  this five stars is the band. Perhaps I just need to break it in.
4.0,I thought I was getting the shorts to come down to just above my knee like the picture shows but they are really short.
4.0,The elastic around the ankle was fairly lose but great shoes otherwise
4.0,Flattering and flirty
4.0,The product is great. It functions really well. I gave this watch to my uncle because he needs an alarm watch. He loves it so much.
4.0,This dress is great. I purchased this as a cover up for a beach vacation and it’s nearly perfect. The only complaints I have is the material seems like it could shrink so I’ll avoid the drier but it also seems to wrinkle. The only other issue is the pockets are a little too low for my liking they hit at an awkward length but the way the dress is cut it doesn’t look awkward it’s just not as functional as I had hoped. 5’4” 130 bought a small and the length hits right at the ankles
4.0,the dress looks pretty and it adds that zing and glitter for any evening event. however the size is a bit large than expected. i had to keep pulling my sleeves so that it wouldn't fall off from the shoulder.nevertheless a very comfortable and pretty dress!
4.0,"Why ship a hat folded in a soft mailer?  Really?  Top of hat is thin fabric, which is good and breathable.  But very wrinkled now.  Brim of hat has 2 hard creases that may never come out.  Currently have books sitting on it, may throw it in dryer for a minute.  But, just WHY??"
4.0,"Cute skirt, but runs small through the hips. So if your a curvy girl and want to be able to get in and out of the car without falling in and then rotating, go up a size. Other than that, the flow and pattern of the skirt  makes for fun wearing. Just wish it came lined, then you wouldn't have that extra layer of a slip to take up space where your curvy bits meet seams."
4.0,Great casual dress!  True to size - love it
4.0,It's a very pretty and lovely bag. I saw the real one in store. The real one is far prettier than the picture here! The leather is soft. There is a small stain of glue at the hand holder. It doesn't matter but I think they can make it better.
4.0,"The effect of the blue snowflake sparkling is very pretty. My snowflake is significantly larger than the one pictured, covering almost all of the red. This might be by design, making each snowflake different, but I bought it partly because I wanted a red jewelpop; I already have blue ones. Still, I'm thrilled to have another Disney-related jewelpop, since I originally bought my Kameleon ring in WDW. It would be great if they'd make more inspired by Disney characters."
4.0,Pretty and delicate.  I'm happy with my purchase!!
4.0,"Very cute and helps keep my daughter warm, but not too warm"
4.0,the extra three dials are cosmetic but they look good.The time was off out of the box but setting it where there is a good signal fixed and the next day it was same time as on my phone. The voice always seems to say its PM but its definitely on time if you disregard the PM in the morning.  The online instructions were great.
4.0,"Well its ok, cheaply made so i was a bit disappointed when i got this, i guess you get what you pay for?"
4.0,Nice fit and was of good quality.
4.0,"Great accuracy since it bluetooth connected , great find my phone function.<br />Unclear time reading due to missing digits on the screen , absolutely useless stepcount function and calories count since it indicates nothing about your burning due to the fact the watch does not measure your pulse.<br />If you look for tracking your activity you should go with a sport watch like Garmin or similar."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my friends' 3 month-old baby (got the size 3m-6m) and while it fits, I hope there would be more room for baby to grow with it.  He's a tiny baby as it is and this fit well, which means it runs a little small.  Still, super cute, well constructed, overall decent, just remember to get a size up so they can grow into it."
4.0,I'm 5'4 and 128-130 pounds and definitely could've got a small in this but all in all I love it and it's very comfortable. I love the color also.
4.0,"Not sure how well it will hold up, but I love the look and seems well made."
4.0,The color is off.. I ordered thinking its nice and bright... it was more of a dull and faded purple than what is pictured. However the cut was nice and it fits well and it's still cute. I ordered it for a specific event which requires brighter colors.. so back to the drawing board for me
4.0,"I always wear a size small bikini and I own several other swimsuits from the same brand in a size Small. However, this suit definitely is a bit larger than usual. Order 1 size down."
4.0,"I like the shirt, but there is no flannel only material where the flannel should be. I is comfortable when wearing it."
4.0,Fun cute T!
4.0,Hahahahaha saw many girls at even with this type of dress omg Gosh I looked like a red sparkly potatoe!!!! Resturned my bad...not theirs...
4.0,"These are nice flannel - pretty roomy and don't shrink significantly. They are definitely low rise though, so I wear them with a long thermal shirt and all is good - I don't get a cold breeze at my midriff. They are comfy. I bought them in XL because they are juniors and I am not a junior. I also sized up because I know flannel can shrink. But they are plenty big - maybe even a little too big. I am 5'9"" and 155 pounds. I could have easily worked with a large.  I have washed them once, and it doesn't seem like they will pill."
4.0,"Looks good, feels cheap but it works. It's kind of annoying the sound of the machine in quiet places."
4.0,Meet all my expectations except they are baggy almost everywhere. Waist and length OK
4.0,My original review stated overpriced but since then the price was cut in half. At least for now. I still have problem with coin moving though.
4.0,"Liked texture, disliked elastic top!!"
4.0,They were a good product just a little tight.
4.0,"I am between sizes so I had to return. For the price the quality is acceptable. I did find that the elastic around the leg holes were a little loose on both sizes, so the fit was not snug."
4.0,"This is an automatic watch which means no batteries and does require it be in motion for it keep time. If left unworn on a desk, it will slow and eventually stop. It is a beautiful looking watch. The frame is metal but the band is leather. It has a sophisticated look and feel which makes it appropriate for formal occasions as well as everyday wear. Recommended."
4.0,Super nice top part is almost see through
4.0,"They are thin, so I'm not sure how long they will last."
4.0,"Love the necklaces, beautiful. Only thing is how small the clasp is to put on an take off, other than that I love the way they look"
4.0,They fit prefect loving them.
4.0,Very nice skirt with stretchy material. However if you are a woman with a big tummy and a couple of back rolls please know that this skirt is going to go up under those rolls unless you have on a shaper that is going to keep your midsection from resting outside of the skirt. So watch yourself. The length is great. I am 5'8 with hips and thighs.
4.0,"I originally ordered the size I thought would fit by the measurements but had to return because too large.  Exchanged for smaller size, perfect fit.  I also was amazed at how fast I received them.  Very happy with purchase."
4.0,"I like these so far. I got them because I didn't like how hard I had to squeeze the metal spring collars that my boyfriend has. These are big, big improvement."
4.0,I can’t say I dislike anything! The bands met my expectations and I love each one. Very well made!
4.0,"Light weight, super cute, received a ton of compliments - took away one star because I had to trim the strings on the earrings before wearing them since there were several that were longer than the others."
4.0,keeps the dust out but a bit uncomfortable
4.0,"These socks fit my three year old perfectly. They come right above her knee, which is fine, otherwise they fit perfectly. They are super cute with her purple/pink cleats and shin guards. I cant wait for her first game!"
4.0,"I own a few different Lark and Ro dresses in this same size, but for some reason, in this style, the fit was just a little bit off on me. The pockets kind of puckered out at my hips and it wasn't a very flattering fit on me personally. The dress itself is of good quality. The material has a little bit of stretch to it. This cut might be more flattering on an hourglass figure than it was on me (I have a little more padding around the middle)."
4.0,Love them fits nice looks real
4.0,I have been looking for a bra that's pretty even on a big girl
4.0,"ok, just a bit too big"
4.0,"Larger than I expected, but a very nice, classy cross."
4.0,"This sweater is definitely oversized, but it is perfectly oversized.  It sits just right and falls off the shoulder as expected.  Super comfortable yet stylish.  The quality is also very nice, it is soft but the stitching is very thick.  It kept me warm on a very chilly fall evening and looked great while doing it!"
4.0,"Esta bueno el diseño, pense que era un poco mejor. Compre dos, la otra con otro diseño, y estan bien, pero pense que tenian mejor calidad."
4.0,"I thought the dress was very cute, but more for a smaller figure.  I purchased a medium and was hoping it would fit but there wasn't any give to the dress and if you are a bit top heavy I would size up.<br />It's a super cute dress though."
4.0,"I loved this swimsuit. For my build- I’m a rectangle shape (same dimensions throughout my figure)- I liked it a lot.<br />I returned it, sadly, because my booty wasn’t covered all the way and I knew it would bug me.<br /><br />I’m 5’7”, 140lbs- size 4/5…medium was a little too big. I should’ve done the small (but that would be even LESS booty coverage- haha!)<br /><br />For those that don’t mind some cheek, you’ll love this suit. Made well."
4.0,Great cover-up but runs small.
4.0,Other than having one broken strand when it arrived I've enjoyed the necklace & earrings.
4.0,Very soft. I was worried about the little seams that run right up the front of each cup but the fabric is so soft it doesn't matter. I ordered the largest cup in my size and I think I would be more comfortable if I had more coverage. I am always pulling it back up in the front.
4.0,I am a size large 59-60. This helmet was so tight in a large it actually gave me a headache trying it on for the first time. Buying an XL now. Returned XL and ordered XXL. So think two sizes larger if you are normally a large.
4.0,Very comfy but very wrinkly
4.0,These are kind of thin and they run big I think but for the money for sure worth it.
4.0,It's pretty good but the magnetism of it affects the watch.
4.0,The gloves were very nice quality and worked great in the snow but still don't keep your fingers from getting so cold that they burn from the cold
4.0,"I bought this for my husband last Christmas... and the cross itself is still holding strong, but the chain... not so much. The chain is tarnished looking and can no longer be used. We love the design, but are disappointed about the chain."
4.0,It depends on your face structure and personality. I couldn't pull it off as mush as the people who can. Just imagine yourself in them and compare em to your actual style
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars, would have received a solid 5 if I could have fit it...but the dress is very nice for those who can get into it...I am a 40DDD so I am not sure if that played a role, I have sent it back"
4.0,"Wow! Very pretty! Great for costume, dress up or even a fancy event."
4.0,"I was surprised at the quality of the umbrella for the price I paid. No more struggling to get into the car and out of the rain. I have only used it two times so far therefore, I can't give it a 5 star review. It has performed well."
4.0,Warm and great looking.
4.0,The shirt fit nicely on my body but the material was very cheap
4.0,LOVE THE WAY THEY LOOK BUT IF ITS HOT OUTSIDE YOU WILL SWEAT TO DEATH WITH THIS ON!! JUST SAYING
4.0,Acceptable belt for price. Would have preferred the edges finished off better but it is ok.
4.0,"Wallet has room for more than 3 or 4 cards.  I carry DL, 2 credit cards, debit card, health insurance card, etc. so extra room is a plus.  Some card slots are tight-> and extra 2 MM in width would make a lot of difference."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:47b269df50e7289cdafcfdf268d92a26]] The plastic is not the best but if you’re careful, these are a nice fashion accessory."
4.0,Very nice! Loved it!
4.0,"bought it to use as a costume for my daughter, fit was great"
4.0,Not for women with boobs.
4.0,Perfect!.  I second the positive reviews.  Very handsome & well made w/good quality leather in matte-finish chocolate brown.  It's slightly padded so feels nice to the touch. An excellent value for the price.
4.0,Nice and bright but makes me look very broad shouldered.
4.0,A strong case but I cant open it with one hand.  Its also a bit large for my reading glasses and bulges in my pocket making it look like I'm happy to see everyone.
4.0,I bought this dress to wear on an interview and was pleasantly surprised at the quality.
4.0,This watchband worked well with my Invicta watch. The curved ends work OK but the curved ends that were on the original band could be used and worked better.
4.0,"Runs 1/2 size large. 7yo loves wearing these to school. Look very cute with dresses, yet appropriate footwear for school playground. Soft heel to prevent rubbing/blisters. Daughter noticed stretchy heel right away and commented positively. Flat footbed, no arch support"
4.0,My nephew is going to LOVE this costume! I only wish it came with a hook hand!
4.0,Hard to get on but really nice
4.0,I liked the weight
4.0,I absolutely love the concept of this item! It’s eye catching it’s light weight but steady enough to be felt it’s easy to open and once filled in with photos the clasps are very reliable.<br /><br />HOWEVER... the change in color happened after only one use and I didn’t get the different colors advertised. Received two “golds” instead of the rustic gold one and two silvers instead of the rustic silver as well.
4.0,Great shirt fit
4.0,T wear these under holey jeans and for leg support.
4.0,"Saved a LOT of money over some of the much more expensive winders!  It makes some noise, but a great bargain."
4.0,So these are super cute.  The print on them is beautiful and the material feels amazing - however they're super big.  Honestly these would be perfect for someone who is pregnant.  I tried several ways to make them not look big and sloppy but I couldn't make it work.  They are however comfy!
4.0,"I love the print of this garment. It is colorfuland complements pretty much anything. Made from polyester, it is light nd easy to wear. It has n open front with a string to tie , ifdesired. It looks great with aa t shirt and jeans. Lighter thn a sweater it is  fine accompaniment for a summer eve. Fun piece . Machine wash and line dry."
4.0,"It's hard to tell from the photos, but this tankini fits really loose in the middle...great for covering the tummy."
4.0,"Husband loves it, large enough for his head and a bit of body to the hat. It's nice and soft on the inside but it definitely would get dirty if anyone has wet hair or product in it so keep that in mind. Maybe wear a scarf under it if you do use product."
4.0,You get what you paid for! A little wide on my wrist but I absolutely love the look 😍
4.0,Nothing wrong with the hat. It was just too small.
4.0,Bigger than I thought but I can still wear it .I should of gotta medium but material is very soft.
4.0,"It's an inexpensive watch. The quality matches, though I am still pleased with it. I work in a rugged work environment - so there is wear already visible (a month after purchase). I could not find a perfect balance between being too tight and too loose; I included a picture of the eyelet spacing."
4.0,"This is a cute graphic T-shirt, a little larger than expected, but the main thing is that the shirt actually came in a totally different green color than the product description photo, more of a light olive green than the more emerald, darker green in the product description.  If that matters, that's why I took a star off the review, otherwise, it's just a cute basic graphic T-shirt."
4.0,would order more
4.0,Good quality glasses but a little too big for my face in my opinion. But not a bad product maybe I need a different style.
4.0,"The product is stiffer and more durable than I expected, which is great because I think it will last longer. The double pack was also perfect because I can give one to my Father and my boyfriend. The size is great and fits good in the wallet I bought for my Father. I am very pleased with this product."
4.0,not really 3x
4.0,"This arrived with the picture centered but not as crisp as in the product photo.  This is to be expected given the material and is not a big issue.  There is a purple cast to the picture, though, that is not really what I expected and is why I rate with only 4 stars.  I have attached a picture so others can better appreciate what they are buying."
4.0,"6'2&#34; 175 lbs 2XL fits perfect height wise.<br />Roomy thigh snug on calves.<br /><br />Had to cut extra string from pockets, but fabric and pockets feel quality"
4.0,"Great little bag, well worth the money."
4.0,Cool little buy.  I collect odds and end of anime stuff.  I like this buy.  it's well designed and cheep.  Also it looks nice!
4.0,Love the shirt but definitely struggle to take it off since it's so tight knit in the back. Fits perfect if I don't lift my arms up.
4.0,Very cute booties. love the color and the style.  Fit is perfect.
4.0,"I got this to wear to a jungle themed event hosted at the zoo.  I didn't want something that I'd never where again so I didn't want anything leopard/zebra print (not my style).  This dress was PERFECT!  I was nervous about buying a full length dress online though because I have a terrible time trying wear long dresses that actually fit correctly.  I'm 5'10 and this dress went all the way to the floor!  So, maybe if you're shorter this wouldn't work well, but if you're a tall person - REJOICE!"
4.0,It is a little larger than I thought but I'm satisfied because it provides a greater feeling of security than what I was previously using.
4.0,It was good.  Undamaged.
4.0,"Definitely cheaper than I expected (and very lightweight), but it looks just like the picture and is still very cute! None of the jewels or anything have fallen off. It's held up great!"
4.0,Soft material and the cut is flatting.
4.0,"Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it's a little bit cheap, has a hole after just one wearing. But if you don't mind potentially sewing up a small hole I think it fits well and it really cute. Got a lot of compliments on it! I'm 5'10 and have issues finding long enough rompers and this one has worked so far!"
4.0,Thank you for the e-book gift a true blessing for those that don't know much about crystals. short and simple with all the valuable info. Also might want to upgrade the materials of the actual chain for the future? just a suggestion I use the black one but some people might want a metal one that's sturdy/doesn't turn green etc.
4.0,"Nice enough dress. Bought it as a 40s dress. It is nice and thin, but definitely shows every curve. I generally wear an 8 in dresses and I ordered the L (8/10). I'm 5'7&#34; and about 155lbs. The length is good. I probably could have worn a medium, but the large fits well enough that I won't bother to exchange it."
4.0,Fits big.
4.0,"I love this sweater, super stylish good material my only complaint is the sleeves are a little tight."
4.0,Great fabric. It's weighted so it will hang/cling on the tummy. Adding deep vneck would make this betyer rated. Would be great for maternity.
4.0,I bought the Burgundy because the picture looked like the perfect deep burgundy but when in person its more muted (dull) burgundy. Beautiful dress but not the color they mentioned.
4.0,Nice dress just didn't fit my daughter well.
4.0,"These cargos are so great! The fit is wonderful......except the length!! SHORT! I am 5’7” tall, 107 lbs. These pants fit everywhere but the length. Way too short! Which makes me sad.....cause they look awesome on everywhere else."
4.0,"This is my third purchase. I have the black and beige stockings which fit about the same. These are marked as the same size, but they are definitely tighter than the other colors. I can’t wear them all day, or they cause pain and swelling in my toes."
4.0,Great value for money. I needed to find the right amount of bling for my two year old daughter. Perfect size for her little ears.<br />I did read the backing fell off easily. My daughters fell off about a month into wearing them and luckily the earring was found and I just placed another backup earring gummy to the back and has remained in place since.
4.0,"Good band and overall fits pretty good.  A little heavy, but working well."
4.0,"It's very light and thus feels inexpensive, but it IS inexpensive. For the price it seems pretty good though. It looks nice but will probably scratch off the color pretty quickly. Again, 4 stars because it is adequate for the price."
4.0,"The owl was very cute and sparkly. The chain nice, but little loop connections in back were very sharp. Had to use a tweezers like a pliers to press in do as not to cut or hurt the neck."
4.0,Gorgeous dress! Ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it fit perfect. So beware of sizing. But it looks great on and received many compliments on the dress!
4.0,They are very comfy and the fir is perfect!!!!!!
4.0,sorry did not fit me
4.0,Looked nice as expected broke after 2 weeks
4.0,Wear this on two different day 1st day was in the30’s it  was very warm the 2nd day was in the 20’s was still warm so far I like it
4.0,"The wand is almost perfect. It came in a nice felt bag and has a great feel and weight to it, however it's not 100% straight and veers off towards the end making it a little unbalanced. Still one of the best wands I've seen."
4.0,"These shorts fit great, and are great quality. The light pink is a beautiful color, however it’s a little see through so will be exchanging for navy."
4.0,Way cute
4.0,Like that it has adjustable straps and has the tie that helps cinch in the waistline little more.
4.0,"Very cozy!  I’m 5’2”, size 12/14. Pear shaped.  The top is big, which is great cause you can wear it over other clothes.  The pants run small, which is disappointing. I ordered a large."
4.0,"I work in a WWII museum, so we decided to dress up in WWII military garb for Halloween.  This costume was not bad at all.  I thought it ran a little small, but I expected that.  It was somewhat adjustable.  The fabric is not particularly breathable, but not too hot.  The overall look was good -- Nice details, but oddly put together: Army green uniform with US Navy buttons.  I will use it again next year. Worth the money I paid for it :)"
4.0,I love the beautiful color combo and print . I prefer softer material for the bottom. It's too thick material  and causing a big puffy  effect. that's why it did not keep it.<br />thank you .
4.0,Good quality my boyfriend loves it but it came with a couple scratches on it.
4.0,"For reference, I'm 5'6"" and weigh 160 lbs. Not technically a plus size woman but I was looking for something with a looser feel.<br />I received these stockings in a size XL and they're amazing! They fit great throughout the leg and the greatest thing is the waistband doesn't feel like it's squeezing the life out of my belly!<br />These are perfect if you have love handles like I do. They are a very high rise and compress your tummy a bit so that your love handles don't look like big rolls on your sides.<br />The material is high quality, thicker than expected and very smooth. These feel great on my legs.<br />They come in a pack of two which is a terrific value. They are my absolute favorite, go to stockings!"
4.0,These goggles are a tad on the bulky side but the lense is clear and they seal very well to your face.
4.0,comfortable and easy to put on...
4.0,"Glasses were a perfect size, and great quality! Only issue I had was in the preview picture the sides of the glasses seem to have a more red tint to them. But in reality they are more brown. Overall I love them and even got another pair but in the black/silver!!"
4.0,"Overall these are really good. I am not super well endowed but needed these for a swimsuit that came with no padding. These are the perfect amount of coverage without looking too full. They also do not get super heavy in the pool. They are perfect for what I needed. I gave it four stars for the price, as one set is a little bit pricey."
4.0,Very smooth material and love the colors
4.0,It’s alright. Not really like the picture
4.0,The most important thing about a brooch is that the clasp works...it does. Fun for the holidays.
4.0,Its super soft yet light weight and pretty in person
4.0,"Took 3 weeks longer than said. Said was shipped in US, but I dint think so"
4.0,It was small in hips
4.0,I typically wear a small mans size but had to order the medoums
4.0,"These sweats are comfy - just what I want in a pair of sweats. Not sure about Amazon’s description of “high waisted”, but they at least come up in the stride to just past my bellybutton.  Non-side seam pockets are nice. Inseam length is just a tad short of 32”…"
4.0,"A mi hija le encanto su traje de baño, a mi hijo no le gusto mucho el modelo del short"
4.0,Get compliments on these all the time.. I wish they were a little longer on the leg
4.0,This dress was better than I expected for the price that I paid.  I am 5'8&#34; and it fit me a few inches above the knee.  I felt comfortable wearing it the only negative is that is wrinkles easily - keep it hanging up before you wear it!
4.0,"Live the dress!  Ordered the color coffee, but it is defiantly purple."
4.0,This was super comfortable. I got so many compliments on it. I didn’t give five stars because it’s kind of see through. I had to wear shorts under it which I didn’t like because you can see them. Also the stitching made it uneven. The picture didn’t match up correctly near the stitching. Also after just a few wears it started pilling. Over all I did enjoy it for the cost tho.
4.0,Love that it is adjustable
4.0,They were a little larger than expected.but still a good value
4.0,great piece alot of detail but more attention needs to be done on back pins !
4.0,[[VIDEOID:d2f933dfd5619af782e5e38b28861520]] I’m not usually a fan of silicone rings but I got this one as a gift for my niece who absolutely loves Harry Potter.  The fit and size is comfortable and the ring is durable.
4.0,Nice warm Bennie. It’s soft and it fits perfectly.
4.0,Good Looking but very small diameter
4.0,What can one say about socks! They are socks and only have a life of a year wearing them with steel toed work boots.
4.0,These are some on my favorites. It's hard to find nice leggings that have 2 pockets and fit 😫  the worse part is that I have yet to see any other colors other then black or the 3 pack of the grey blue and black.  I want to get more of them but I don't want all the same colors.
4.0,"Must buy the base! Only missed opportunity was not prewiring for a simple light add on kit.  A missed sales opportunity in my opinion. Otherwise great product, Happy with purchase!"
4.0,The bracelets themselves are really cute; I couldn’t use the cards that came with them because the font was a bit blurred/streaked but we just put a sticker over it and wrote on that
4.0,"This is a very cute and light dress! I ordered a medium, however, the smocked part in the back gives the bust area some extra room. I wear a 34C bra and I feel like I could have sized down for a a more true to size feel.<br /><br />I still love the dress and plan to keep, but if you’re bust runs on the smaller side consider sizing down.<br /><br />The material is light and thin, but I tried it on over nude biker shorts and didn’t have any issues"
4.0,"These are comfy, warm, and the skid protector is a great feature. I'd say the shelf life is about 6 months, before they begin to wear out, which seems reasonable for slipper socks."
4.0,"These bars are big and flexible. I like them enough, and they work better than a normal bar when you're pregnant. I just wish I had realized they were so long. I had to cut mine down some."
4.0,"Well made product, however they were so unflattering compared to another pair of size medium swim pants I ordered and tried. I have really wide hips so it made the front stretch into and unflattering figure, if you know what I mean. I normally wear mediums in pants - If I were to order these again, I'd choose large, though then they may be too big in the legs.<br /><br />If you’re more slim and straight hipped, they’d probably be great! Very cute pattern!"
4.0,Fit is somewhat small for those of us who are larger chested - but definitely looks cute under anything!
4.0,The material not what I thought it was going to be
4.0,"The dress is beautiful; however, the top is slightly bigger in size and there is a hole at the seam between the blue and black portion and sheer portion at the bottom."
4.0,"I ordered these in L-XL because I figured they would shrink.  I am 5'5"" and 145 lbs.  They fit comfortably but were very long!  I soaked them and left them more wet than damp and put them on high heat in the dryer..I did this twice..and it worked!  Now they are a perfect length!"
4.0,The G rubbed off within three wearings.
4.0,Easy to wear and clean it off.
4.0,Need to charge frequently...and button light up. I was expecting them.to light as you walk. Not seller fault.
4.0,"Nice design but it makes hurt my fingers, so I cuted off that stuff that was hurting my fingers and it’s Ok now. I’m giving 4 stars because I took one star for myself for the extra work."
4.0,I bought this for my tween daughter thinking it was a junior size but it's def. adult sizes.  It ended up being to big for her but it fit me so I kept it instead.  It's really cute and I wear it all the time.
4.0,Pretty to wear. We're hard to close.
4.0,Not as bright as the photo but I much rather like it that way. Its very good quality for the price! Would recommend
4.0,Nice backpack.  Good quality.
4.0,Good looking wallet...I got the gray one.  The id window flap is really cool but adds bulk. All the compartments are tight especially the id windows. I'm sure they will listen with use. All in all it's a very nice wallet.
4.0,The costume fits true to size and it arrived on time just like the seller described. My daughter really likes this costume. She bought extra accessories to complement it and the whole ensemble now looks like one belonging to a regal goddess. What helps is that the costume has enough extra material to have it be 'flowy' without being too big. Just right.
4.0,These are great quality but unfortunately the whole 0-36 months might be misleading. At least for the younger babies because this beanie is too big. We will still be keeping it as we really like them.
4.0,The rings are made to small for big handd
4.0,The material inside wears away really fast.
4.0,Little Girls love this watch. Makes a great gift!
4.0,"A little thinner metal than I expected, but overall seems sturdy and has a sturdy ring and chain attached to it"
4.0,"Beautiful dress, really nice quality. Had to return it because it did not fit my petite frame, even with a small. The pockets hung down to my mid thigh. Wish they made it in petite!"
4.0,Got it as a gift for my sister she loved it
4.0,"Really like this top. Only pitfall is they r ‘handwash’, but I just put in my washer with hand washable’ setting, dry only for short time and then hang. It seemed fine.  I’ve ordered another one. Just wish they weren’t 20$ apiece"
4.0,I am giving four stars for the shirt because the quality of shirt is very nice! I am 5’3 with 133lbs and unfortunately the small size was little big so had to return it!
4.0,"I love this cardigan duster. It is slightly larger/longer but comfortable. I ordered my normal size, so keep that in mind."
4.0,highly visible and letters are nicely sucken not just printed.
4.0,Large oversized scarf that’s super soft.
4.0,"The picture is a little deceiving as to the color. What is supposed to be a dark red color is actually more purple than anything, so it does have a very feminine look."
4.0,"Tight fit, looks great."
4.0,"Ehhhh... It's a great mtb shirt. Quality of materials, design and feel. I love the style too. Between relaxed and athletic fit. But.....Why they decided to put small ventilation holes across All the shirt? If I'll use it in the summer I definitively will got some Maori Tattoos.....I love it anyways. But as a reference, I love really mean Girls too. Maybe the tattoos look Good. Who knows?"
4.0,Comfortable and well made shoe. Laces are very short which can make it difficult to get good tie but otherwise great shoe
4.0,I bought this for work and it does the job.<br />I'm 4&#34;11 94 lbs and bought a small. After it was washed it fit me pretty well just a little big. (Normally I'm an xs so this was expected.)<br />It kept me pretty warm and is comfortable too.<br />I took one star off because I thought it was supposed to be a cable knit sweater but it is sewn to look like one. (To clarify it IS sweater material) And there are some long threads on seams that I'll have to remove.<br />I still think it's cute and all and don't have any problems with it I was just surprised.
4.0,Nice color and comfortable.
4.0,Love this shirt.  G only complaint is it’s a bit sheer. I ordered a couple in different colors.
4.0,it's OK fabric alitte rough.
4.0,I really like them. The only negative is that they are too small.
4.0,I was satisfied but would have been much happier if the material wasn't so very thin.
4.0,"Shoulders are tight, but it looks great as long as I don't plan on lifting my arms."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:be86a44f2975609c6768657cec991d6c]] This is the first inflatable costume I've ever tried on. Thanks to my experience with this one it certainly won't be my last.<br /><br />Instructions for attaching the fan mechanism were straightforward. They even suggest using a USB power bank like many of us have for our phones instead of the supplied battery box so you don't have to burn through double a batteries. I think my wife's reaction in the video says it all.<br /><br />Wanted to subtract one star because it is rather hard to see out of, but it's manageable, but being my first inflatable experience that may just be how they all are.<br /><br />I'm going wear this to my kid's school Christmas party next week...They're gonna love it!"
4.0,Great Stuff!
4.0,"Ordered these after seeing them on a fashion blogger. 4 pairs of earrings for $15 is certainly a good deal! Taking away one star because the teardrop shaped earrings are slightly mismatched (one is bigger than the other, slightly) and the triangle shaped ones had some pieces of rattan on the edges that were rough and broke off. It didn't noticeably affect the look though. Overall, very happy with my purchase."
4.0,"This was pretty, but it felt too much like a bridesmaids dress to me. I’m also 5’2” and it just felt too long, even with heels."
4.0,Nicely Made.
4.0,Very sturdy pants very comfortable feel I love the material but the sizings were very small and the XXL is just a little too short but quite wearable and I'm 6-2 so for tall people buy the XXL or none at all
4.0,"I have been spoiled, I have ordered from you before. Loved my other bracelets this one Will be incorporated in to other projects."
4.0,"The dress fit fine ( i ordered one size up after previous reviews stated it ran a little small) , just had a bit of trouble with the zip. But it worked out in the end when i just cut a few stitches that were sewn too close to the zip seam. For the price, I got a great deal, and was complimented by several friends."
4.0,"Kinda larger than I expected. They have a really nice comfy stretch to them, so I could've gotten a size smaller and they probably would've fit perfectly. Colors are awesome! I will buy again, just a size smaller."
4.0,Cutest Bunny Slippers ever!
4.0,(Wifes comments) Comfortable Jean skirt. Runs a bit longer than I typically like but fit elsewhere so I will just wear it a little higher. I am 5'0 and typically wear a size 2 or 4.
4.0,"It is as it looks, basic.<br /><br />I have been wearing it on longer runs and I havin't gotten any shin splints, but I dont know how much that has to do with the sleeve itself.<br /><br />For those on a budget with the intent in figuring out if sleeves are for you, this is EXACTLY what you are looking for."
4.0,"I ordered a medium with my bust, waist, and hips being 35, 29, and 36. It fits almost perfect, just a little loose, but I don’t want it so tight against my body anyway. Only critique I have is the arm scoops seem to be lower than expected, however, I may just have a short torso."
4.0,"EDIT- After review company contacted me concerning the shorts.  They explained that they had some issues with their sewing machines. The machines were repaired and they replaced the shorts. So far I haven't had any problems with the shorts.  I appreciate the quick resolution and the company's willingness to address and correct the issue.  EXCELLENT customer service!<br />Bought two pair,  on BOTH pair stitching separated on the bottom of both back pockets. Had nothing to do with the fit, they fit great."
4.0,"I ordered this Moyabo Women’s 3/4 Sleeve Striped Pullover Dress for my granddaughter. She loves to wear dresses and hoodies, so this dress covers both of them. The dress seems to be well made and about the right size. She wears an extra-large in US sizes, so I ordered the XL. The dress looks warm and comfortable. It's made of 95% cotton and 5% spandex, so the dress has some stretch to it. It will look good over leggings this fall.  I may end up editing this review after she wears the dress."
4.0,Fits perfect! Looks very classy when adding a blazer. Great for in the office look.
4.0,Just what I needed to complete my Cher costume!
4.0,"They're cute bras and stretchy so getting a smaller size meant it fit perfectly. However, I wish they had more support. I wore it once to jog in and I regretted it. They're more for yoga or walking. Not activities with a lot of bounce."
4.0,I look like a total diva in this fit! It compliments all my sexy curves and my husband was blown away. Loving this look.
4.0,"I like all the hooks and loops and inner pockets. I’m specially appreciative of the outer pocket, since as a student and a woman, I’m always reaching for my card or keys. I like the fact that it’s a sling bag. As a teen in the 2000s, this was all the rage. I know carrying your bag in both shoulders is the right way but I was finding that I would carry in one shoulder. Which can be damaging and plain silly, so I just went for it."
4.0,"Good wallet for the price. One of the zippers hangs up a little bit the more I use it the better it is getting. The material feels nice. It has plenty of space for cards, cash and checks. Even my phone can fit inside."
4.0,"charms stated falling off, otherwise its good"
4.0,Shipping took longer than it was supposed to. Rocks were as expected..i got 16 in my package.  Good for painting short words or small artwork.
4.0,I love this skirt! I should have gotten a large. It could be that I have a small waist and bottom heavy. I thought to was best to get the XL.
4.0,"Very happy with the quality of the watch itself especially  for the price. The tool however, broke after taking out one link. Had to have the other link removed at a store. Would of been 5 stars except for that."
4.0,"Nice, well-made wallet.  But a little too large."
4.0,It is beautiful!  I wish the chain were a little thicker.
4.0,Super cute. I intertiobally bought different gems because these looked cheap (and they are). The other thing that bugged me was that the tree thing inside is loose. Great for mother's day though.
4.0,"A beautifully constructed cap that fits my big head well! Only complaint: Britain (in my opinion, the most important word on the cap) is too Small! And  the color red gets lost!  I am going to add highlights to the word to emphasize!"
4.0,"I'd give 5 stars if not for the misleading photos. This is a good size for a pendant, but incredibly tiny for keeping cremains. We were expecting something more substantial & detailed based on description & photos. Apparently we missed the dimensions. My son picked this to keep some of his grandfather's cremains but he may choose another, less dainty one. Seems to be solid construction, just not what we were expecting."
4.0,"Bought this for my soon to be 4 year old. She is very petite, so luckily it fit her perfect. This does run slightly small, so I would suggest going up a size if you want to get longer use of it, and not have your kid grow out of it in a few months. Super cute little jersey."
4.0,Beautiful just bigger then I expected  for my 6 year old.But she loves them.
4.0,Love the colors. It is a little low cut but I’ve gotten numerous compliments when wearing
4.0,Really comfortable for 35 bucks
4.0,I like these sandals the material is comfortable for them to walk in might run smaller or bigger however it leaves room to grow .
4.0,To long had to get it hem like the color
4.0,This is my second purchase of this brand. I am pleased and would buy them again.
4.0,"Easy ordering and very timely shipping speed. Love this shirt, but it's very short and the sleeves are slim fitting. I'm a 10 in jeans, normally a M/L in tops. I ordered the XXL and it's still a bit small. Going to wear it anyway cause I love it. Seems more like it was made for girls than ladies."
4.0,Works out well. Does the job. Glad to be able to buy just backs. My daughter loses backs all the time
4.0,too small for my curves
4.0,"I love it, little bit smaller than i thought but I am satisfied and in with it."
4.0,They weren't big enough
4.0,"Much bigger than I expected, especially on smaller wrists."
4.0,"I ordered several different styles of face coverings for face masks.  This was one.  Pocket for filter when fabric is doubled over to tie and place over mouth like bandana.  Also works in other ways, so will be useful for future use beyond mouth covering.  Ties around head, so you set your own tightness which is a plus in my book.  4 stars because my son wasn't a huge fan.  Preferences vary."
4.0,"Very warm and soft, internal wire very stiff takes getting used to"
4.0,"The color is true to the product picture and it’s surprisingly more supportive than what I expected! The padding was comfy too. The only minor issue is the strap going across the upper back. It pokes outward when your scrunching your back, but it doesn’t feel uncomfortable or anything. Would buy in other colors!!<br /><br />For reference I’m 5’3 34C 130-135 lbs and the medium fit perfect! Order your regular sports bra size"
4.0,"Looks nice, and have received lots of compliments."
4.0,"Super cute shorts but the sizing is off.  Many reviewers said that the shorts ran small, but I disagree. I am usually a size 8, so I ordered a size 10. They were huge on me. I may even have to order a 6 based on how big the size 10s were.  Again, cute shorts but order your regular size, or even a size smaller."
4.0,Styling is key!
4.0,So far so good I like the variety and they haven't bothered my ears so far
4.0,"This fabric is not soft, therefore if you have fibromyalgia I do not recommened getting this, it will hurt. Besides that, the dress itself is nice."
4.0,"This is nice but it’s very basic and the material isn’t the highest quality, you’re getting what you pay for here.  I wasn’t planning to wear it out but was looking for something to wrap up in while I’m lounging in the house and this will do well.  Size is rather oversized so on a small body it would be a lot of material.  The length is nice and the fabric is a medium weight and has some stretch.  To me, it’s just okay, you can probably find a little nicer one for not much more money."
4.0,The pendant is not as large as I was thinking that it would be.
4.0,"Love it, doesn't have an angled flap like shown (straight across flap). Nice leather and fits comfortably"
4.0,It doesnt feel cheap consodering the price. I might buy a nicer chain for it down the road.
4.0,"Boots arrived quickly and in good condition.  Good seller!  Cute boots,  wish they were more true to size.  The next size over would be to large."
4.0,"Even though this item is quilted long underwear, my primary use is as a light weight jacket.. I like everything about it except I wish it had pockets."
4.0,Good and comfy to wear
4.0,nice tie. goes well with a window pane shirt
4.0,Very nice. I will repurchase the other colors. I gave it a 4 because the front opening is very low and can benefit from an inside button. I used a safety pin to close.
4.0,Good for costumes!
4.0,"Product is good quality, but runs small. Definitely go a size up if you are on the upper end of the size range."
4.0,I ordered one for me before that was an xl. Just right. I usually wear a large. I went up 1 size to get a little room and it doubled in size.
4.0,economical basic product does what it is supposed to do.
4.0,"Very cute for the price! Looks great on, very flattering."
4.0,"This is helpful for keeping ties in good shape but it’s a tad short, wide, and thin for a perfect fit for two ties. I couldn’t put the ties side by side because this isn’t wide enough to do so I had to stack them, which smooshed them because this also should be a bit thicker to accommodate that. It would also be better if if were maybe an inch longer so the ties don’t have to be bent at the end to fit."
4.0,Socks are great - I just couldn't remove thick band holding them and ruined three pair
4.0,"1st of all, this is totally cute & it’s exactly as pictured with bright colors & a sweet unicorn face hood.<br />The plush fabric may be THE SOFTEST plush I’ve ever felt - it’s velvety soft.<br />There’s a snap at the bottom of the hood, under her chin, that keeps it from flopping off her head, probably since the horn & ears & nose add some weight. The belt is sewn at the sides so you’ll never lose it & it won’t be a pain in the washer/dryer!<br /><br />When I opened this up, I wondered why it didn’t come already zipped into the Dr. Unicorn bag... & quickly saw why: It’s much too big for the bag!<br />I got this bathrobe in size 5-6 years & there’s just too much fabric to fit in the pouch.<br />I can see a smaller size fitting with no problem but, no matter what I did, it would not fit & zip!<br />I followed the video here on the listing, I folded it, I rolled it, I wadded it up - didn’t matter. There’s just too much fabric to fit in the zipper bag!<br />Which is a shame because the idea is great. The Dr. Unicorn bag is sewn into the inside back of the robe & you just need to get all of the robe into the bag.<br />If all the bags are the same size, it’s never gonna work for the bigger sizes.<br /><br />This is an absolute 5 star bathrobe BUT I have to knock one off for the failure of the transforming part.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this review & I hope that it’s Helpful for your decision!)"
4.0,The reason i do not like to review is i always have to write a review or the stars will not be seen. Do something about this or i will not do any reviews for any products in the future.
4.0,Just fits my 4 year old. And he is small
4.0,"I have bought not 14k FL State pendants twice and loved to wear them - twice because of course they tarnished with frequent wear. So when I found his 14k one I ordered.  I placed on my own 14k chain & I love it! It is thinner than I expected as in the picture it looked thicker, and so care will be needed when not wearing as it would bend easily. It is well sized, light weight, high polish. I love it!"
4.0,I was not really happy with the colors sent.. A few of them looked really similar but you can't beat 20 tongue rings for that price
4.0,Great piece for dead heads!!!
4.0,Loved the style and color was as pictured! It fit a little snug since my hair is thick and voluminous and maybe what makes my head a little bigger (at least I like to think so! lol).
4.0,I liked that the earrings were the same as shown online when I ordered.
4.0,Heavy and looks good!
4.0,Soft and wonderful. Little big but not to much.
4.0,My husband love green and gold so the cufflinks were perfect for him.
4.0,Beautiful. Fits perfect.
4.0,These fit a little tight in the Butt area (probably because of the cut for teens) Overall super comfy.
4.0,"Son hermosos pero todos los palitos traseros me vinieron doblados. TODOS. no lo devuelvo por la tardanza, deben tener cuidado para empacarlos!!!"
4.0,Good product but expensive
4.0,"Nice purse, had to return was smaller then expected."
4.0,I like the style. It’s easy to wash. Not like the picture the material is thin.
4.0,So comfortable. Love the color and fit as excepted. I ordered some more.
4.0,bigger than i expected and i don’t like the neckline apparently
4.0,Did not realize Mikli is a secondary Alain Mikli line of frames.
4.0,They make it super-easy to get dressed in the morning. They have so many cute tunics and dresses you just slip them on over a pair of leggings or tights and out you go.
4.0,"Comfy, soft fabric is thick enough to wear without a slip. The chest is very loose/open if you have a small bust, plus the opening for the tie shows skin sometimes, so a cami is needed.  For reference I'm 5'2&#34;, 32B and got Small. Otherwise it's very nice and hits right above the knee - perfect for the office or a nice dinner."
4.0,"Made great gifts for women in family! They love them. Very good for sports, the cotton makes them comfortable when exercising. They fit well and do not ride up. Would buy more again."
4.0,"Got the biggest size they have & still its a bit tight but wearable, if you are bigger than a USA 14-15 the XXXL will not fit you. Also the colors look more like black & tan than the blue & pink/purple pictured."
4.0,"This top was a bit larger than the other size large tops that I buy from Amazon, but it is fine. I like that the fabric is a bit heavier than the other rayon knit tops I usually get. It is much sturdier also. This is a very well made top and I love the color."
4.0,"love the design and is a perfect fit,"
4.0,"Check the size chart. The 3X size fit me perfectly. I am 5'11&#34; and wear a size 10/12. The 3X fits a waist from 29&#34; to 36&#34;. So even though I know in the USA I am not a size 3X, I guess in China I am. I am pleased with the fit and length."
4.0,Looks like pic but runs a little small wish I would of got a bigger size
4.0,"These are great running tanks. My husband enjoys using these in the summer to help with his tan, and to keep him cool as he runs. His nipples chaffed a little when he ran a half marathon, but overall pretty good."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift and it looks even better in person. It doesn't look cheap at all. The only thing I'm afraid of is that it won't fit her wrist! It's not the biggest bracelet, but very nice non the least. Definitely would recommend this buy...for small wrist people."
4.0,"it was beautiful, but it's not steal, it felt like and sounded like plastic when tapped"
4.0,"I have had this watch a few months and it is great. The accuracy is about within 2 seconds a week. The watch is very nice indeed. However the illumination is almost non-existing, and the band looks a bit cheap. Other than that, it is a great watch for the price."
4.0,"GREAT buy for $13. I bought this to dress up as my boss for &#34;twin day&#34; (we work at a school). Was not expecting anything super high quality and don't really expect to wear it more than this one time. So it's definitely a great buy for the price.<br /><br />Just note on the color: I bought this in &#34;457_light Brown&#34; and the color is much lighter than in the product photo. It's almost a little red. Can't speak to the other wigs and this didn't affect my ability to dress as my boss, but others looking for a light brown should know its not the same color as the pic - that's why I took off a star."
4.0,"I like the detailing and the design, my problem is that it is very thin. No big deal it is sturdy and shines nice."
4.0,"honestly never thought i'd write these words, but these run on the big side. after i washed it, i dried it (something i never do, i let almost everything hang dry) it fit a lot better but i wish the sleeves were a little more snug and it was slightly shorter. other than that, it's a great hoodie. like some of the other people said, i don't think you should size down, just know that it'll be a little loose after the first wash."
4.0,I know they state that they are oversized but these are huge. Way too big...not fashionably oversized more like ridiculously oversized. Would not recommend unless you have an abnormally humongous head
4.0,"This is a super cute dress but you definitely need to size up. I normally wear a size 16 dress and I ordered a 2 XL and it was a snug fit in the bust area. Usually when I buy dresses or tops they are way too big in the bust area, because I wasn't as blessed as most in the boob department, so I was pretty shocked that it was tight in that area!"
4.0,Ordered 2 others.
4.0,"Great thickness, love the length (cropped, but still goes down past my calf). I'm a 14/16, 5'4&#34; and ordered XL. I round normally order L but read reviews about these running a bit small. Great hidden pocket, nice size. Currently hauling around a heavy cast from below my knee to toes, and these (tightly) go over the cast. Comfy and didn't reveal any &#34;crack&#34; 😬 not the same quality as that super famous brand, but well worth $18.99 and I'm very happy... Just ordered a second pair."
4.0,Price value = great
4.0,"Good looking watch.  Had to cut the band a little to fit my wrist which is not unusual for me.  The band is convenient for that because it has lots of holes.  then I just used a little leather tanner to cover the edge where I had to cut it.  It is self-winding, and so far is keeping pretty good time."
4.0,"They're super light weight so I almost feel like they're going to snap or bend easy! The case has a soft (hard?) Zipped up shell. It does come with a cleansing wipe :). They look rather fantastic on, though. The tint brings out the yellows in your views but they don't fall off your face at all. The cool shop made a prompt delivery. I couldn't wait for these to get here! Overall, great standard pair of sunglasses."
4.0,"this dress is very pretty but it was just a little too shiny and tight for me, and the straps and torso were too long. Would probably work better on someone taller. I'm 5'6 with an hourglass figure, and I usually wear a 4-6. I bought a large in this dress, and the overall length and width were fine, but I think I'm too short-waited for this particular garment"
4.0,"Very cute sweater however,  it fits awkward and alil big..<br />I feel Like I could have went down in size.."
4.0,I like this top. Good quality and washes great. Hung to dry though. It's a little to low for me at the neck part. Maybe I could have gotten a small.
4.0,A little on the ‘tight’ side be wearable
4.0,I purchased these for my ten year old son for football. He loves them. They fit perfectly and he says they are comfortable. Great cleats on the field!
4.0,These shorts are fantastic. But buyer beware they run small. Had to size up to a large and I never buy large stuff.
4.0,"Good quality product. Took awhile to receive it, but I love them."
4.0,"Update July 18, 2016<br /><br />The company contacted me and wanted to make it right, so they offered me a new pair. I asked for a size bigger, and so far, so good. Will update if there is a change. The company has great customer service.<br /><br />These shorts looked nice and looked like decent quality, but the bellow happened while I was climbing onto my truck bed on 3rd wear. When I put them on these size 32 were a bit tight around the thighs. I'm not fat, but I do have thicker legs from football days, and these shorts did not fit right. Good on waste but def not around legs. I think they're made for really skinny people with no curves. Don't buy if your built like me, but if your real skinny they'd prob work."
4.0,"I love you, it just fits a bit large."
4.0,Cute socks and the message is easily read but they are pretty small. I do not think they would fit a woman over a shoe size 8.
4.0,The fuchsia belt looks exactly like the picture.  The color is great and it really perks up my black and white outfit.  It is an inexpensive belt but with a jacket you cannot see the elastic and it really looks nice.  Be sure and look at the size.
4.0,"For the price it's a good buy. Clasp is a little cheap, probably will et one or two wears out of it before it breaks"
4.0,"Really good. Maybe it's just me, but sometimes water gets in, no matter how many times I adjusted it."
4.0,Love the glasses. Just wish I knew they were a bigger size. My 3 year old doesn’t fit into these yet. Have ordered from this seller before and got the correct size that fit her when she was 2. Wanted to replace the old sunglasses with same size. She will grow into them eventually.
4.0,Very lovely. Had to pinch it a bit to make sure it stayed in place. I love it thank you
4.0,I’d give it 5 stars but one came with a defective zipper and won’t stay zipped. The others are great. Wonderful for surgery recovery.
4.0,"For how many you get and the quality of the material, I feel that this is a good deal. However, the jewelry is very large. Some int he set are smaller than others, but overall, very large if you are not into that look."
4.0,Package was sent to the wrong address-wrong state.  I'm not sure where the mix up was but it took a b it to get our product.  When we finally did it was worth the wait
4.0,Ours came with two light pink belts and was missing the navy one. I ordered for my toddler but they actually fit my 8 and 10 year old girls better. They wear girls sizes 8 & 10. The leather connectors are stiff at first but do bend fine to snap closed. My girls like not having a belt buckle in the front. My middle child is requesting one that is rainbow colored for Christmas. This product seems like it will last and is of good quality
4.0,"These are very cute earrings. They’re very seasonal and colorful. I actually really like the turkeys and the earrings with the 4 leaves that came in the set. The rest of the earrings were not at all my style and much bigger than I was hoping for but the price was good and I did get a couple of nice earrings to wear in the fall out of the set. I am 65 years old, so a young girl would probably love this set."
4.0,Love this shirt! A little see through and runs just a little small so wear a slimming cami under it (for us bigger humans!)
4.0,"It arrived quickly, it was expected, good sewing, acceptable quality, but beware of the size.<br />Missing rear reflective tape.<br />Small pocket."
4.0,"Great fit, true to size.  I received many compliments"
4.0,badass heavy
4.0,"Good product for the price. The only concern is the ends are not sewn in causing it to roll under when adjusting. Minor inconvenience, though."
4.0,"I read so so so many reviews saying these run big, so I ordered a small when I’d expect to need a medium. I haven’t worn it yet, but I can tell you this is the size I would expect for a small. I’m 36 weeks pregnant, wear a size 7/8, weigh 154lbs, 5’0” tall. I expect it to be long because I’m very short, but being pregnant I should’ve trusted my gut haha. Bought these for after my section, hope I pop back like before or they may be snug. 🙄<br /><br />Buy the size you expect, not a size down like reviews make you think you should."
4.0,Nice and lightweight.  Perfect for the warmer climate.  Only issue is that when I first put it on one of the belt loops broke off on one half and I need to sew it back on.  It has to be a flaw because it broke the moment I touched it and is probably an issue with this one robe.  The other loop is holding strong.
4.0,True to size. Fits my 10 year old perfectly.
4.0,Misrepresented not in the box but other than that it's should be ok. I brought for Christmas present so I am going to have to purchase boxes
4.0,Easy to wash & wear<br />Can be worn with a medical mask under or over it<br /><br />Ordering was confusing<br />I wasn’t able to tell the size<br />Eat loops are a bit big and strap is too long but the face mask wears like a med not lg. I wear a medium<br /><br />Comes disassembled<br />Easy enough to arrange it properly
4.0,"I used these stretch cord key rings for my children when they were young.  We always had a problem with lost and misplaced keys.  Then these cords solved our problem.  I attached them to the zipper on their back pack and put the key into a pocket on the back pack.  Whenever they needed to use them, viola!  there they were,,,never lost or misplaced again.  The first time my grandson called us up to let him into his house because he forgot his key, I shopped for these cords.  They are a good solution, however, the ones I had purchased for my own children were much thicker.  I wish these were a little sturdier and thicker.  Time will tell how long they last."
4.0,"Very happy with it.  The fabric is 95% cotton.  Therefore it is soft, breathable . The color is a strong vibrant yellow , and matches with fall wild flowers.  The cut of the dress is very forgiven to chubby belly , however, slightly tight at the shoulder which will give away after wearing.  I would like to give it a five-star  . The one complain is the wired cut of the back side is such that it visually enlongates the upperbody, making lower body /leggings shorter . Adding A belt will solve this .  Overall, it is  A wonderful dress for early fall."
4.0,"Pointy tip fell off the piercing, it was well adjusted and out of nowhere it fell. Sadly lost it. But the round ones are firm."
4.0,Love the long slim cut but had to order a large although I normally wear a size 4 petite. I have ordered two so far and will order more. the first one I purchased was a size medium which fit just right over leggings but was just a tiny bit snug in the shoulders. I hope they get more colors soon as I would like to order another size large since they hang nicely over wide leg pants. Excuse me since it fits nicely over wide leg pants. The material is smooth and lightweight but I would not call it crepe.
4.0,"I am someone who happens to be very passionate about pockets. I kind of went out on a limb getting this jacket, and here is my honest review.<br /><br />I love the number of pockets there are. Some of them are hard to access and I don't use all of them, but I love having the option. I travel a lot, and this jacket has helped me save lots of space in luggage!<br /><br />Pros:<br />As long as you follow the washing instructions, washing it is easy.<br />The sheer abundance, sizes, and variety of pockets<br />It's stylish! I got lots of compliments the first time I wore it (I will take pictures soon).<br />The option to remove the sleeves is great so that you can turn it into a vest<br />I love how each of the pockets are labeled.<br />The material is decently warm (not for cold winters but works great for San Francisco weather)<br />Waterproof! I've worn this jacket in the rain and I'm impressed with how well the material repels water (see hood comment below).<br />Lastly, it's comfortable. I've been wearing this jacket since I got it and I love it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />The jacket is too tight. Even though I ordered a size above what I normally wear, it is still too tight (especially with the pockets filled. However, I don't know if the size up would fit better. It's tight around the chest and a good size everywhere else, which is why I'm hesitant to try the next size up.<br />Getting my phone out of the designated pocket is rather difficult. Also, the pocket for headphones isn't that convenient.<br />I wish there were a hood. This jacket is versatile and great, but it's a pain to wear when it's raining (the plus side is you can fit a small umbrella in the pockets so there is that).<br />This jacket collects lint like you wouldn't believe. I have a lint roller so it's not that big a deal, just be aware."
4.0,"Shockingly great buy (purchased the black floral, floor length). Not sheer, drapes well. Light material. Will last a summer or two as it's likely intended to."
4.0,A nice gift for 5 years old toddler
4.0,Adorable but runs a smidgen small.
4.0,So far so good.  It is holding up better than one I had purchased less than a year ago from somewhere else.
4.0,"Came earlier than promised! Looks just like the picture. Light material, more than enough pieces to match your wardrobe and moods. Like!"
4.0,Fits huge.
4.0,"I ordered these for my 3 yo girl to play in because she wants to be a ballerina ""just like Felicie"" (Leap). They fit good.<br />She loves them!"
4.0,Smaller than shown
4.0,"Great product, helps to keep things organized within the backpack. Lots of pockets. Material is too stiff though and fits too tightly in a smaller bag pack."
4.0,"Overall I like this suit. It's a different way to wear a two-piece and it takes a little getting used to but it's really nice and modest without being as grumpy as a lot of mom suits. This does run a little small in the bottom. I am 5&#34;7, 140lbs and have 3 kids, youngest is 1. I have mom belly build and this is nice and supportive in the lower tummy area. I normally wear a medium but I ordered a large in this and I'm glad I did bc a medium bottom wouldn't have fit. The bottom fits perfectly on the top half. I deducted one star bc I feel like it's cut a little odd on the bottom- the crotch is a little too square so it's baggy just slightly in front and the leg holes are just slightly too tight for a large so they give me a little leg muffin which I don't love. The top has a little padding but nothing crazy and it's adjustable tie straps so nothing to complain about there. The print is vibrant and flattering. I will wear this."
4.0,Not for toddlers. Got it for my 4 year old as she has a big head. These are so loose it wont stay up at all. Really struggling to find masks for her.
4.0,"Nice Bag, but the picture and the description don't clearly depict how small the interior compartment is. As a matter of fact, the description says it's large... it is not. Nevertheless, it is a very attractive bag and would work well as a daily work back or a small travel bag. The brown leather is nice but does have a plastic feel to it. I'm not completely sure it's real. Honestly, I couldn't tell. Whether it's real or fake, it looks like it'll hold up nicely and makes the bag look more expensive than it was. The side compartments are roomy enough for a pair of shoes and toiletries and the front compartment may fit a book or other travel items. The center compartment has pockets for your cell phone and a computer mouse,  is large enough to fit a laptop, a pair of jeans, a few shirts, and a sweater. However, you have to be strategic in your packing. This bag can easily look overstuffed for lack of space. My husband loved it though, however, he is very tall and I can't imagine he'd be able to fit more than one pair of jeans and two shirts in there. I predict he'll be using this as a daily work back for books, office supplies, and his computer. If you're looking for a small bag that is stylish and affordable for short travel, this bag will work for you."
4.0,They didn’t work for me only because I have mid foot arthritis. The arch support put too much pressure on the top of my foot causing me pain. If you don’t have arthritis in your feet I think you’ll like them
4.0,"My biggest con with all her charms (and I have a number of them) is that they are Much smaller then depicted. They are 1/3 the size shown on the models bracelets.  Barring that, they are well made, and really lovely."
4.0,"The first one I got had a half slip but crooked pockets so I returned, the one I received has good pockets but no slip.  Very cute for the price."
4.0,Adorable earrings for the price. Took a long time to ship though.
4.0,Like a little necklace. Strong too.
4.0,Very satisfied with the leather but there was no holes for the buckle so ...
4.0,"The butterfly patterns on the masks are very attractive. The cloth is thin and stretchy, it may not be thick enough for COVID protection as a single layer, but it’s good for wearing on top of an N95 or surgical mask as a declaration bearer. The straps are very long so the length may need to be adjusted as shown in the photo."
4.0,Upon my first wear I received a ton of compliments on them. I love that it came with a cloth to wipe them and they block the sun quite well. They’re just a little too big to wear with my hats though so that’s why only 4 stars.
4.0,"Haven't wore this top yet, however it fit perfectly.  I purchased a medium (5'9 145lbs with long arms and legs, kinda broad shoulders with no boobs lol) and the medium fit great.  The material seems heavy enough for a 40 degree or lower day, but given that I am prone to hot flashes, I probably wont wear this top until fall."
4.0,"I ordered an XXL based on the reviews. I usually wear a large or even a loose-fitting medium. The XXL is almost the same size as a large Amazon Basics shirt, but with sleeves that are only XXL in width. I have laid the jacket out under an Amazon Basics large shirt for comparison. The zipper opens on the left, which is typically a women's jacket in the US. The material is a glossy fabric similar to basketball shorts. It is thin, but still decently warm. It feels durable enough to wear casually, but not something meant for a rough day. It is nice for fans, but may not be the most authentic choice for serious cosplay."
4.0,I love the bottoms they fit great but the top was way to small however  I'm a little<br />Bustier so I just gave it to my cousin who had smaller chest and she loves it :)
4.0,Nice glasses. .. look sharp at a fraction of the price. Looking to buying another pair.
4.0,"Suggested size ordered. However, it was to small. Other sizes not available."
4.0,Beautiful  and worked great for a costume to run in.  I'm 5'2&#34; and the finger holes were in the perfect spot.
4.0,Perfect for swim wear cover up
4.0,Colors are not as rich in person but  still  cute
4.0,Very thick and warm. Nice but I wish they weren’t so thick.
4.0,"Stays gripped on a full work day! No show on most shoes. Great quality, love the look!"
4.0,Stretch suspenders comfortable.
4.0,"What I disliked is that it was damaged ,it has a hole in the back which I did not notice until I had worn it and thrown away the bag it came in."
4.0,I love that it fit perfectly. I'm Petite but usually wear regular medium just yo be safe and yhis was true to size
4.0,"I love it mostly for the colors but it is a little cheaply made. But then, it didn't cost much either"
4.0,One wash and they look and feel like they're 2 years old already.
4.0,"Bought these for my son's class and they fit good. Gave them an 80's look. They're 8 years old. Have to say they are not very good quality but for the price, it's right."
4.0,"Cute shirt. I ordered a size up, XL - I’m 5’5 155-160 lbs. It’s loose but not flowy like pictured. It’s a nice soft material. The print placement is different, which I don’t mind too much but something to keep in mind if you want the exact print."
4.0,"These watches are cheap. They don't last too long before they tarnish or turn copper, but I like them."
4.0,"This is a decent top for a low price. Order up, runs a little small, especially in the length."
4.0,I am obsessed with the bottoms. The top is pretty but justfits me awkwardly. Definitely will get again
4.0,"These are a gift and so I can't swear to their comfort, but, they are very cute, and I know she will love them."
4.0,Cute shoe but very wide.
4.0,My husband liked this.  We had looked everywhere for him a new wallet & I found the perfect one as a better price.
4.0,"True to size. The arms are a bit short, and it is very soft & warm. Haven’t washed it yet, and I hope it holds up after a wash."
4.0,"Better than drug store brands, style at a decent price."
4.0,Love the print! NOT squat worthy. Size is perfect!
4.0,Wish it had the kangaroo pocket
4.0,Looks expensive and is not overpowering.  I rally like this ring
4.0,It did not fit me. I wear size large.  I gave it to my daughter and she looks great in it.  Very pretty.
4.0,Its exactly what i was expecting. .I am happy with my purchase..it looks just like the picture.I recommended. .and It looks cute on my neck with a genuine leather..that you can smell it
4.0,the plated color
4.0,"Very cute, but be aware the fabric is pretty cheap so I am being careful not to rip it."
4.0,As advertised but the strap is a bit stiff which makes it a bit hard to fasten.
4.0,I like the comfortable flowy aspect of this dress. The material is super soft and color is beautiful!!
4.0,Bought a 2x and usually have to size up when I purchase online... but I actually have too size down on this sweater love the quality but a little to big perfect for lounging ♡
4.0,Purchased as a party favor for my 9 yr old boys that play hockey. Colors matched their team uniform. Quality seems good. Was a hit with the boys.
4.0,Nice shirt. Fit as expected.  Looked really cute on my daughter.
4.0,"As seen in the photo a ove this bra definitely works magic. But I think the D cup is just a touch too small as I had some spillage out of the outside edges. But in the end, it did what we needed for the shoot. Size 38 D"
4.0,"It was fit good, but too small. Not good for chubby womens. Quality was good"
4.0,"I agree with another writer that the hardware should be modified.  It should be able to use with ease to either fill the boot shaft so the boots dont crease over and be adjusted so that you can gradually stretch the shaft. It can fit a small womans riding boot by allowing the inner hardware to slide up, but then there is no tension. With some maneuvering, I was able to get it into my boots with tension as I wanted these to gradually stretch out a pair of boots , but it shouldn't be complicated. The middle piece that connects the two is fine in that you can spin it to make shorter or wider. The problem though is that the ends dont fit deeply into the wood and there is a large slit so the hardware can collapse into the wood.  This collapsing makes it hard to get tension if trying to use to stretch a boot. If they did that, then these could compete with the steel 200 boot stretcher I have seen because let's face it, boots made outside of usa are made for people with ankles smaller then my wrist and I'm not a big girl at all. And cedar is a nice product then metal in your boots. I would like to note mine were sent in a very dirty box that looked like oil split in it, so I had to clean them before use."
4.0,My mistake.  These particular caps are not adjustable.  Be sure you order the correct size.
4.0,The hoodie is nice and warm but they do run  a little small
4.0,"Im 5’10, 220lbs. I ordered xxl. This fits a tad on the small side. It’s not tight but it’s not loose. “Fitted “ I guess I would say. Idk how much it’ll shrink though after washing it. I don’t usually put my clothes in the dryer since it’s not good for them and bc everything shrinks on me. Tall people problems..... lol<br /><br />I recommend wearing leggings with it. Wearing as a dress may be too short, well for tall people it would be. Otherwise your tush will be hanging out lol<br /><br />I ordered the black and the red. The black one, the material is very itchy.  The red one is not, and is quite soft. Maybe different material bc of the color?<br />Maybe washing it will help...<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because I only tried it on, I haven’t worn them yet. But these are my first opinions. I’m not sure how well they’ll hold up after a few wears and washes. I will come back to update my review if I feel my opinion changes."
4.0,good all my friends think they are wicked swag and block the sun really really well so ya buy these
4.0,"Fits pretty good, but a little tighter than I like, so was going to exchange it for the next size up, but they were out! I was bummed because this is really pretty and made with quality fabric. Maybe they'll get it in again in my size...I can only hope! If you think you can wear this and they have your size, get it! It's really flattering on, even with hips and a bit larger busted! I am only 5'0' and 128 lbs and the L was too small...You must be thin to wear this one, or I just got one marked wrong size? I believe it is Asian sizing, so I think it was marked right and they just run really small, and I don't think there is much difference between each size because according to other review it sounds like women not too much small than me could wear the size small, which means I should be able to wear a L, but I can't, so think and wish they'd make it in an XL, but it doesn't state if it even comes in one or if they are just out of that size. I definitely recommend for a thin gal, as it is very pretty and seems well made, although I didn't wear or wash it, so hard to say how long it will hold up, but for the price, if you can even wear it just a few times you'll get your money's worth."
4.0,Quality is surprisingly good. The material is a little “plastic feeling” in some places. Overall I’m very happy with the purchase.
4.0,Somewhat small in the chest area other then that good
4.0,"Yes, I look like a sexy nerd now. All the ladies will think I'm smart and rich. They'll give me stares, lick their lips, flip their hair and say &#34;You're handsome and I love you're cologne.<br /><br />You may have 99 problems but these glasses ain't one.<br /><br />Oh, and people with real glasses will look at you suspiciously only because all the ladies you're attracting.<br /><br />If you want the babes get these shades. There is no guarantee this will work......it did for me : )"
4.0,This is a nice bracelet. I don't expect it's actually a lot of real copper considering the price of copper and the light weight of the product but it looks good. The sides of the links are etched to achieve the &#34;antique&#34; look.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8d7969656cada7ceddf51f9f546267eb]] I got the 2xl since that's what I normally wear for certain tops and bralletes however for bra sizes im a 36/38L US size and in UK sizes i tend to wear 36HH, 38hh, 38h, and depending on the brand i go for my ""sister size"" 40G. It looks nice with good stretch but I will be returning to go for a size 3xl<br /><br />Edit: Ended up exchanging for a 3xl but honestly wish there was more sizes so I could get a 4xl to feel more comfortable rocking this without wearing nipple covers if I move the wrong way 😒"
4.0,Fits well except that perhaps 'baby'online means slightly short blouse and high waistline.
4.0,"Fits well, I ordered a size larger to give room for growth."
4.0,This dress is very cute. Fits well.
4.0,"Is  beautiful, just like in the picture. the fabric is great, but a little short, I have approximately 5.3 and weight 180. I bought the XL, it was beautiful but a little tight, so if you have more than that ,doesn't buy that won't feat"
4.0,"Super cute, fits right but too short.<br />I'm 5'10 about a 10 maybe 12. It fits right but I have to pull it up at the top and tie the tie pretty tight to stay up. Will probably still wear"
4.0,"Arrived earlier than expected and looks exactly like the photo. The band says genuine leather but it seems to be of lower quality, which to me isn't an issue. I like the face of the watch and usually by bands that I want to go with the watches I buy. Its a nice addition to my small collection, the wood grain stands out. Overall I am happy with this purchase and am looking to buy just one more of a different color when a deal comes through again."
4.0,"This was just as expected,  fits perfectly"
4.0,"Very pretty ! I really like it, the only thing is that the color is not pink it's more like a lite apricots"
4.0,They are cute but much smaller than I expected.
4.0,It's a little &#34;blousey&#34; in front but workable.  Love the color.
4.0,My teen son loved these. Fit perfectly.
4.0,Little big for my daughter but she’s still able to wear them without falling. Now she has a pair like mommy’s.
4.0,Very nice enamel charm.
4.0,The necklace don't fit my neck
4.0,"Overall, this dress looks amazing and is very flattering! It does run a but small in the general scheme of things, so I had to order the next size up. Usually I'm an XL in dresses (size 16) but I had to order the XXL for this dress. The top does fit a bit weird and it is a little longer than it looks like in the picture."
4.0,The fabric is a little thin but has a nice feel to it. The color was what I expected. I got it quickly
4.0,"Having this under my shirt made getting to my ""stuff"" very challenging. Not sure how to make it better."
4.0,"It fits as expected, though I wish you had an option of buying separate sizes for top and bottom for my body type. I usually need the bottoms a size smaller than the top. The cups that come with the top are weird shaped so I removed them...but it's pretty normal for swimwear as I always stitch in an old bra for shape."
4.0,The dress was purchased for my 10 year old daughter and she loved it.  Looks very nice on her.  The only thing I do no like is that after 1 washing the skirt part looks faded.
4.0,"Great body chain! Holds up well and I've been able to wear it multiple times. However, I wore it with a bathing suit previously and it turned my skin green since the metal isn't the highest quality. Overall pleased with my purchase though as it was exactly what I wanted for any outfit I've worn it with."
4.0,"i lose too many sunglasses - after giving a name-brand over $200 in a 365-day period... i decided never again... these are working great (oddly enough, haven't lost them either :)"
4.0,Loved this too
4.0,Nice ring. Purchased for my daughter. Unfortunately it broke after a couple months! Needless to say she's devastated.. will try to find her another
4.0,super idea
4.0,"Fits well.  A little big around the neck, but not really noticeable.  Sleeves are not long to wrist-about 3/4 just below elbow.  I ordered a large 12/14.  The material is comfortable to the skin.  Have not worn item yet.  Not sure how it will wash.  Maybe better to wash by hand or delicate cycle.  Overall I am pleased.  Can't wait to wear it."
4.0,"I love this dress, but I have no idea where they get that it runs small. I'm 5'8&#34; and about 170 pounds. I normally wear a 12 so I ordered a 14 because the seller said it ran small. The 14 was huge on me. I reordered in a 12 and it's still loose. I could get a 10 and it would fit snug, but I decided to keep the 12 and just wear it with a belt."
4.0,"These are gorgeous, and such a good deal for the price."
4.0,My dad loves these a great gift
4.0,"The shoulders are a little poofy for my taste, but it's a nice shirt, and good deal"
4.0,"These are nice, for a good price.  Very light.  I bought them for covid, and some places (some schools) say that they are not allowed as masks, but others think they are OK.  They are more comfortable than normal masks."
4.0,Wish the sock felt more like a regular sock
4.0,perfect size for my smaller summer bags.  holds enough cards and my id .
4.0,"I have only had the wallet one day so a review is a little premature, but I can say it came on time,(3 days) and it is a good looking, well made wallet. It came in a box with a felt bag cover with a draw string. Nice. I don't know how to check if the chip blocking tech works so...."
4.0,"The cut of this dress is beautiful and flattering. However, after one wash, I can see that the fabric is delicate and probably won't last long. I ordered the purple color thinking it was a deep plum color but is actually a bright purple. I got a medium and it was a little big on me, if you're not sure what size to go with, size down, the fabric is stretchy."
4.0,"Love it for adult use only, it couldn't handle a kid bashing out around."
4.0,"Fit good as the waist, but the legs were way too wide.<br /> Good length too but my thighs to skinny I guess."
4.0,"I have really small wrists so I just wanted a band that was adjustable.  Durable is a bonus.  This one fits that description.  It's not stylish and my wrist sweats pretty badly when I work out which is why I gave it four stars.  However, I wear my Apple watch for keeping up with workout activity and listening to music and all the other bands I have had broke.  So far this one has kept up.  If you just want a workout watch band then this works great!"
4.0,"Statement piece...<br /><br />Runs a bit tight on my medium-boned wrist.  If you're a fan of cuff bracelets, this piece is for you."
4.0,"I recently purchased the CAZYTOYZ Non-Slip Kids Ankle Socks for my 2-year-old daughter and have been thoroughly impressed with the quality of these socks. The grips on the bottom have been a lifesaver as my daughter is constantly on the move and these socks have prevented her from slipping and falling. The non-slip feature is extremely sticky, but not too rough on her delicate skin.<br />The socks are made with comfortable material and fit true to size. They also hold up well in the wash and haven't shrunk or lost their grip after multiple washes. The 12 pairs included in the pack are a great value for the price and I appreciate that there are a variety of fun colors to choose from.<br />The only downside I have found with these socks is that they can be difficult to put on, but once they are on they stay in place and provide great support. Overall, I highly recommend these socks to anyone looking for a non-slip option for their little ones."
4.0,look great .. dont care for that they can come apart in three pieces but besides that there great
4.0,"it was so cheap so for the price, I think its a great product. Its so trendy right now too"
4.0,It was a pretty blouse!
4.0,"Very decent waterproofer. I use them on suede sneakers and on leather desert boots. In both cases the material does get a bit darker as the solution driers, but it does have a nice water repelling effect. I find myself reapplying every few weeks, but its not really a hassle.<br /><br />Just remember to open some windows while you're using it. Otherwise I highly recommend it."
4.0,I really enjoyed not having a wallet in my back pocket.<br />Only downside is the rubber band broke so I’m back to using my old wallet
4.0,"I ordered Med and Large size to try em on and see which size was the right for me. I kept Med size! Fits perfectly, got a lot of compliments, I got the dark green and is almost exactly as the shown picture. I could probably find it cheaper at Ross but is ok. I was looking exactly this color and if I go to Ross, I wouldn't find it! Price is fair at least and I got almost exactly what I was expecting."
4.0,"This is a very loose, flowy dress, and the fabric is very soft, cool and breathable. Due to the loose fit I would recommend staying with your normal size- I usually wear a medium in looser fitting clothes but the size chart made me think I should buy a large. The large fits fine but I think I'd prefer the sleeves to be a little more tapered. Right now they are large and fit like an oversized tshirt. The tie around the middle makes it so the bottom part of the dress doesn't look too much like a sack dress when you cinch it in tightly under the bust. I would never have worn this dress if not for the tie actually- it makes the dress presentable in my opinion.<br />I wore this today at our not very well air conditioned office with 80 degree weather outside and I felt very comfortable and cool throughout the day."
4.0,A cute tennis skirt but not shorts! The pink also doesn’t match the picture but i’m not mad about the purchase. Also size up because of length if you want it longer
4.0,Delicate and casual.  Nice work for a small price.
4.0,"These are cute for the price. Cheaply made, but they get the job done for a 4 year old. Since, you know, they grow out of shoes in a week!"
4.0,"Very nice kimono robe! I have to say that I'm very impressed by its good quality and the lovely design. The stock pictures honestly doesn't make justice.<br />I've been wearing it since the day I got it, it fits as expected and since is one size fits all I would say that there is a lot of room for bigger girls.<br />I'm 120 lbs, 5'3 and it's very comfortable. You can secure the robe from the inside with two hidden ties and the belt from the outside.<br />Also I received some compliments from my husband while wearing it ;) the robe is sexy!<br />I love to wear it while I'm getting ready to go out so I don't have to worry about my kids or dogs getting dirty my clothes.<br />You are getting a great elegant kimono robe for a even awesome price!<br />I recommend this product to anyone."
4.0,"Liked the pants but they do run small, ordered 34” waist and should have ordered 36” so easy return and reordered the right size"
4.0,It's a scared. She likes it.
4.0,Bought the same bracelet in red. What can I say other than it's a simple yet classic character piece that draws many compliments.
4.0,"These aren't as comfortable as the Ododos pair I got at the same time. The fabric on these is a little stiffer / less stretchy. Also, the fabric at the ankles and lower legs is looser that with several other pairs of exercise / running / yoga pants I have."
4.0,"If you have a belly, this is an ideal swim top. It WILL hide your belly. The layers are flowy and tend to take your eyes away from the midsection. It will not hug your belly. I buy tankinis all the time - nothing worse than a tight top. Also, the layers go all around your back - so this isn't one of those 'only looks flattering in the front' type tops. This is loose where it should be. It has adjustable straps, I just wish they were thick - maybe thick black straps for a contrast. There's no underwire, which I miss. The bra shelf has really thin removable pads. Considering that there's no underwire, I would think firm cups would be ideal, because for me, it sort of flattens my chest. And I'm small-chested as is, so I don't need that. But, I have to give it credit for the fact that it comes up high under my arms - other are too short & this creates that ugly under-arm fat. Also, it's longer than most tops and it has a pretty pointed hem. Now that I think about it, it's the only bathing suit I have that doesn't require I suck in my belly. I'll wear this with black swim shorts. So there you have it - way more pros than cons. I'd give this between a 4 & 4.5."
4.0,"Very cute jacket, fits true to size. It is on the thinner see but good for fall weather. Only negative is that there were holes in the seems of the pockets. And it needed to be repaired."
4.0,"These are cute aviators. This shape of glasses are pretty flattering on almost every face shape. They are not oversized.  I have a round face and really like how they look on me. The lense is decent at blocking out sun. Not top quality, but not dollar store quality. They are absolutely flat glasses. There is no curve to them at all. That seems to be the trend these days. They came with a white soft sided case and cleaning cloth too. I would totally order these again."
4.0,I love my dress it is made of thin material which make me give 4 stars
4.0,"I liked this bag.  All the reviews previously were dead on.  For instance, you can't fit a tablet in here with a case on it without it becoming extremely bulky.  It has a lot of pockets, and I really enjoyed this bag."
4.0,"Dismal overcast days can be ugly, but these babies cut the blue and brighten the view. They actually cheer me up when I put them on, on such a day. Recommended!"
4.0,"Thie is a cute, comfy dress. The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
4.0,"Fits good, good buy for the money. Fits close around the neck, so if you don't like restrictive things around your neck, then it's probably not the shirt for you.  Otherwise, I really like it and would consider buying it in other colors."
4.0,the material is skin tight but is made out of stretchy material. i got a medium btw
4.0,This was the most easiest watch band you could buy and do your self. I was able to get the band on the watch and sized in about 7 minutes. (of course if you have the right tools) the band looks good with the watch and is very comfortable too.
4.0,"Overall, I liked this set of Caudblor Casual Crew, Ankle No Show, No-Slip Low Cut Socks Set for Men and Women. They come in a handy 9-pack with varying lengths, including 3 pairs of crew socks, 3 pairs of ankle length no show socks, and 3 pairs of no-slip low cut socks. That's enough socks for over a week. The material is soft and fairly lightweight. The only issue I found was that they are cut a bit smaller than my usual socks. While a snug fit, they do not constrict or bind. I've only been washing them in cold water and drying in low heat to avoid any further shrinkage."
4.0,"This truly is one size fits most. I am a size 20/22 and it fits my waist and hips. The colors are beautiful- the fabric is a light breezy thin fabric. The skirt is lined with a blue liner. The hem has a pretty blue stripe with gold accents.  I am 5’6 and it goes to my ankles. Paired with a pretty blouse it would work for a dinner out or church , paired with a t shirt and you have a pretty, casual summer outfit."
4.0,Nice cut with slimmer thighs to ankles
4.0,"This is a really nice watch with a sleek and stylish design.  I received mine at no charge for the purpose of reviewing.  I receive many items in a similar way which means that I have many many items here, most of which, despite very good reviews, I am not inclined to keep for myself.  This watch is different.  I like it very much, like the styling, like the weight and like the quality.  I wear a smart watch most of the time but if I didn't, I am pretty sure this would be the watch I wear and I plan to keep it for either when I get sick of the smart watch or on those days that I am not in the mood to be wearing a watch that is smarter than I am.<br /><br />I should note that the watch I received has a dark brown face, not pure black like the photo and even the band seems to be dark brown rather than pure black but of this I'm not certain.  I know the product description states that this is a man's watch but these days I think this watch would be perfectly well suited to women who like large watches.  I think it has been classified at being for men by dint of its size alone, but not because there is anything particularly masculine about it.  It is a pleasant face that to my mind could be worn well by either men or women.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out, the instructions are not the best but alas for most of us this is not our first watch so we can probably figure out how to work all of the components.<br /><br />The watch comes nice packaged however the &#34;pillow&#34; that it rests on in its box is covered in some cheap vinyl like material and as a result it REALLY cheapens the look of the watch for me.  If you are giving this as a gift I think that pillow will detract from the value.  This would be much better off with a soft fabric pillow like felt or velvet.  The watch presentation would be far far classier.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I like this watch a great deal.  It can easily be worn by men or women."
4.0,Cute dress that is easy to pack for a weekend getaway!
4.0,Grip is firm.
4.0,"i,m glad i ordered a size up it runs small"
4.0,they are pretty good. used to cost half the price and be shipped from china
4.0,"My daughter loves this necklace.<br /><br />As another reviewer astutely noted, the chain is not the one in the picture. It is, however, a nice chain, and the overall look and feel is good.<br /><br />The setting and the stones are really pretty.<br /><br />I worked in a fine jewelry store for years as a non-jeweler (finance), but one thing I learned is that finer jewelry tends to be small like this. Though it's not ""fine jewelry,"" it carries that look for a low price.<br /><br />My daughter loves it, and my wife agrees. Will look really nice with a Christmas dress.<br /><br />So glad to have it."
4.0,Very cute as a cover up. Rauched but not baggy. Seemed small at first but is stretchy with a good bit of &#34;give.&#34;
4.0,"Word of caution, these are very lightweight and breathable. Good if heat is your main concern, bad if you need some padding for comfort. Good quality, just be aware that this variety is extremely thin."
4.0,"Decent hoodie, white seems a little dark to my eyes compared to other white clothing and fabric is slightly transparent. Quality is surprisingly good though, and I like the light fabric it's not bulky at all like many hoodies.<br /><br />Unfortunately if you're a small guy like me this isn't a muscle fit. I'm 5'7&#34; and 125lbs and I ordered a small, it fits loosely which wasn't the look I was going for. Good for the price, but would be nice if there was a XS option.<br /><br />Also I didn't pay attention to the picture when I bought it, there's no front pocket if that matters to you."
4.0,"Works very well for what it is designed to do at the price point it is at. The only gripe I have is that on one of the strap the rivet of the sock clamp is slightly roughly and irritates my calf. After an 8 hour work day I am relieved to take that one side off. I imagine if I take a file to it, this would not be a problem. Overall I will ignore the pain and enjoy how crisp my suit looks with a tucked in dress shirt."
4.0,"I bought these to keep my feet warm at night without having them come off my feet. I wear a ladies size 11 shoe and I expected these to be a bit on the small side, and while they are its not to a point where they are uncomfortable to wear though. I would have liked more room in the toe area, but I knew what I was getting into and can't be too disappointed. The inside of these when you first get them is going to shed like crazy though so you'll need to turn them inside out the first few times you wear them or wash them to get all of the fluff out. Lastly I would like to add that while walking around the house in them I find the little non slip dots on the bottom to be uncomfortable on the bottoms of my feet personally, but I also have very sensitive feet so if yours are easily bothered as well I wouldn't recommend them especially for everyday use. Sleeping in them is no problem at all however.<br /><br />I must be Houdini when I'm asleep apparently because I still somehow manage to get out of these by time morning rolls around. I still like them though."
4.0,"It looks small even on my skinny wrist, but I love it, it is so retro looking!<br /><br />EDIT: Some time has passed so I'll give some more of my opinions...<br />-The light on the display isn't the brightest but you'll still be able to tell time in pitch darkness however it only illuminates from the left side of the watch, not the whole thing.<br />-The band is decent; I can wear it up to the sixth hole; any less and it'd be uncomfortable, any more and it would slip around my wrist. I recommend you wear it loose enough that air can pass through but so that it won't slip around cause it gets sweaty.<br />-I have bumped it against a few hard surfaces and there are no marks or scratches.<br />-With the push of a button on the lower right side it switches interchangeably from standard to military time.<br />-Have not tested the alarm, since I just use my phone for that.<br />-Design looks straight from the late 80s early 90s which is a plus.<br />-How waterproof is it? Well I have SEEN a video of someone blasting it with a high pressure water hose and it still worked.<br />All in all it is an inexpensive, dependable, durable watch that is a little on the small side, but you get used to it. I want to upgrade it with a 18mm(the only size that fits) NATO strap in the future to give it more flare."
4.0,Love this shirt. 4 stars because the price is a bit high for something that you could probably get at dollar general. It's so cute though. Flattering. Not too thick does show bra lines and bumps or rolls but it's flowey so it only shows in the back or I guess if you sit a certain way that it will lay flat or something. Very comfortable and true to picture. Pockets are pretty awesome. Good length for leggings but not too long where it would make you look pantsless if you wear shorts. But yea id buy it again which says something because I am very picky and self conscious.
4.0,Runs small for size
4.0,Priced right; fast delivery; but constructed a little light for windy days.
4.0,Soft!! I like they came with enough filters too<br />I bought another set to be sure I always have one handy.
4.0,Absolutely love it but there are no tags on it. It's very comfortable but wrinkles easy. One thing I do not like.
4.0,"Pretty dress, BUT it REALLY NEEDS A LINER!  You can see right through the material. It's pretty thin.  I would recommend a slip in the same color blue so  the world can't see your undies in the sunlight!!  :)"
4.0,"Very cute, but a little large. I like to be covered, so I thought I would like the larger bottom shape, but it is slightly unflattering for me, personally. I got Med, and am 34C 130 lbs."
4.0,"Looks good, clasp is firm and is the length I ordered. Be patient. Shipping from China does take a while."
4.0,Way longer than expected.
4.0,This is a fun set of 24 colorful bracelets that can be worn all at once to make a statement or a few to give a shot of color.  The red/gold mixture is bright and actually matches many clothes color choices.  These bracelets are large enough to fit most any wrist size yet won't slip off the hand.  I've worn them twice now and have gotten complements.
4.0,"These are the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn!  They are great to wear at work and lounge around at home, and yes I do wear them as pj's too.  They are so soft and a pleasure to wear.  They seem to be made of the same cotton as normal jeans but are knit instead of woven, which is what makes them soft and gives them stretch.  The boot cut is just right too.  At first I wasn't sure if I would like the drawstring but I've worn them several times and never really given the drawstring a second thought, so it's fine.  I forgot to check for belt loops when ordering, and it turns out these pants don't have belt loops (they probably decided it was unnecessary because of the drawstring), which I miss since I like accessorizing with belts now and then.  I also wish the pockets were just a bit deeper to better hold my smartphone.  Other than those small quality of life improvements, these are really nice pants and I plan to get more in other colors."
4.0,"I really like this, super sexy! But material is extremely thin and I could never wear it in public as a swimsuit!"
4.0,"Enjoyed fit and cute very much. Fabric light, maybe cotton? Not polyester which is nice."
4.0,well made very dark navy purse. it is big and has a detachable shoulder strap which is handy.
4.0,"Size 0g, too cute, and very comfortable. Easy to slip in with some oil."
4.0,"Good quality, fits well, and comfy."
4.0,Wonderful shape but very heavy.
4.0,"The material is nice and soft, and it fits well! Only complaint is that the embroidery is asymmetrical - one side goes much further in than the other."
4.0,"These are a good option if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on similar glasses.  However, the lens quality is average at best.  If you are driving a car with these on, you definitely notice some rainbow halo and moire patterning in the lens, which is not great.  But these are not as bad as some other glasses I have purchased in the same price range.<br /><br />You probably won't notice if you only wear for sports, or just outdoors.  But once you are looking through a car windshield or anything with a tinted coating, you will definitely notice the rainbow distortion.<br /><br />Other then that, the materials are basic plastic, very lightweight, decently made.  For the price, about what you would expect.  I was hoping for a pleasant surprise, but no magic here.  Just get what you paid for, which is all you can ask."
4.0,"FIT:<br />Fit was just as expected. I'm 5'6&#34; & 140 lbs, and the medium fit perfect. It's not as tight on me as in the picture, but I couldn't have gone any smaller without some serious bunching issues. This does seem to have a short torso because of that issue. The bust area is also a little lower than I was expecting, but it still covered the goods just fine. The backside covered my bottom, but if I bent over at all it got a little cheeky. Would have preferred slightly longer for safer coverage.<br /><br />QUALITY/MATERIAL:<br />This is literally the most comfortable piece of clothing I own now. I didn't want to take it off. The quality itself was really good, but the material makes the romper.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Overall, it was a great buy. By itself, it looks a little like lingerie and the fit was a little less modest than I was hoping for, but I fixed both issues by pairing it with a kimono and some chunk heeled booties. Great romper!"
4.0,Ahouldve looked at the reviews before buying.... But im still learning. Yea sure its durable but when I went out searching for a pink case for my spare key I was looking for just that- pink. The strap is bright pink and the key fob cover is rose gold. I ordered off of the main picture smh which makes the two seem pretty close in color- which is NOT true. Not happy.
4.0,They are thin and very comfortable. I live in Germany where the winter is super cold but when I go to the grocery store or gym I dont want to sweat. I can throw a pair of leggings underneath if I'm headed to a super cold Christmas market but wear them around the house comfortably. They'll be comfy to wear into the summer even. Will be purchasing later in the year.
4.0,Fits great! I'm a 36C and a 4. Small fits awesome! Great undershirt for layering.
4.0,Arrived as expected.  Learning all the ways I can wear it. It seems a little tight but maybe it's because I haven’t put it on right.
4.0,"This is a dress from an Amazon seller, so of course the quality isn't going to be there. However, it's a beautiful dress and it's quite unique.  I'm 5'3, and it's SHORT. If you're 5'5 and above, I would reconsider getting this unless you don't mind it being extremely short on you.<br /><br />I bought the blue one, because the black one looked a little too costume like. I'm glad I did! I would recommend you get it in other colors aside from black if you want to be able to wear it around casually, unless goth is the style you're going for.<br /><br />When I received it, there were already a few lose threads. I wore it once for an event and haven't washed it yet...in all  honesty I'm afraid to! I can tell that this is going to get misshapen very quickly, even on a delicate cycle. I don't expect it to last me that long.<br /><br />My review sounds negative, but this is actually a pretty little dress. Just know that you get what you pay for, and I have seen this dress in a similar style at other stores for upwards of $100."
4.0,too fitted for my tastes.<br />gave it to a friend.
4.0,"Love this skirt! Only had to knock off one star because the lining under the skirt was not attached other than at the top, so it kept peeking out. Had to tack the lining to stay hidden under the skirt material. Otherwise love it!"
4.0,"I purchased this for my son for his new job. Upon trying it on, it looks good and the fit was right. After he wears it a few times and after washing it I will post an update."
4.0,I like it it's very light weight.
4.0,"This watch was for my wife and she just loves it,for swimming and sports"
4.0,"Grandson loves his watch and his mom, my daughter loves the fact that it actually has other numbers on the to teach children how to tell time with an analog watch."
4.0,"I really live these sunglasses.  The lenses are really clear and the frames are sturdy and fit quite nicely.  I've had them for a little while now and work with then on everyday in the sun.  So far they're holding up to the abuse I out my things through every day.  I would suggest buying these to anyone that's needing a new pair of sunniest.  Not to mention the really really cool packaging it comes in.  The bamboo box with the latch on it was almost more useful that the glasses they came in.  Really,  out did themselves with this item.  For the price,  you will not find a better pair of sunglasses.  Good job to this company.  You have to get yourself a pair today!"
4.0,super cute!! the color is vibrant! looks just like the picture perhaps even a little better.
4.0,They look just like the expensive ones!
4.0,Very comfort sock…. Not to tight on my toes like other compression socks….. compresses lower leg tightly without discomfort
4.0,I bought  2 pair lovery glasses  but I pair is a lot bigger than the other. Also my first pair came in wit cleaning cloth and a little glasses screw driver  and other one nothing but glasses.
4.0,I like color style and fit very casual watch
4.0,Bracelet was purchased for my son.  He was happy with the quality of the leather given the cost.<br />Perfect fit'
4.0,seldom used.
4.0,Cute! Cute! Cute!!!<br />An excellent product with a cute charm and fortune. Absolutely love it!
4.0,"After seeing ads for these on social media, I decided to look for a cheaper version for a gift. I bought several in silver, rose gold and gold. All of the finishes look nice - the bracelet is sturdy - not cheap feeling. My one complaint is that it is awkward to have to put the cuff on and THEN put the hair band on your wrist and roll it up onto the bracelet. A little tedious. I guess if your hand and wrist are small, you may be able to slide on and off while the hair band is still on. Otherwise, great product. Hair band stays in place once you get it on there, and you can switch out colors to match your outfit."
4.0,"I normally wear a large sized shirt, but after reading the reviews I ordered an XL and it fits just fine. Looks exactly like the picture, great color too!"
4.0,It was pretty but smaller than it appears in the photos.
4.0,The one I received is truly the same as the picture. Super cute on my beach vacay!
4.0,"Very happy with them, other than I had to order the second pair because they seem very small for the size stated."
4.0,These are fantastic except for one small detail.  The seam that runs across the toes.  The socks are made well and look fantastic.  But the seam may be a deal breaker.
4.0,I got mine in the mail last week. I've worn them once and I like them for the price. They are definitely comfortable and would be good for lounging around or working out. I wore them to work with a longer top. I asked my teenage if they were see through because sometimes they can be if they are thin but she told me they weren't. I see her wearing leggings all the time. I guess everyone is into the legging craze right now. I like that these are Capri length although I'm short they come above my ankles. I bought 1 pair black in the larger size and one patterned pair in the smaller of these. I think I'll give the smaller one to my daughter..based on the fit I'm sticking with the larger ones. She hasn't worn them yet but liked the pattern. It was the black n white ones with the elephant. Hope you enjoy your purchase!
4.0,"Keeps mask away from nose and mouth.  Much easier to talk and breathe.  It is smaller than first thought.  On me, it covers the tip of my nose and my mouth closed underneath my mask.  Had to wear below my nose and over my mouth to annunciate words correctly.  Would like to see a larger size that covers the nose and chin under a mask."
4.0,Beautiful but the band is too small
4.0,The button up was extremely too small. The vest could not button but I expected that. The stockings were too small. The skirt fit nicely very very short though.
4.0,I love these earring. And I have given as presents and everyone I have given them too also loves them. I get lots of great  complaints on them.
4.0,"Works well, one of the best among my visors. My other visors are a little too big and this one fits well."
4.0,The set is great. just comes smaller then expected
4.0,Just doesn't  have the look that I was hoping. But for the price it is wonderful.
4.0,"well, not bad for the price!"
4.0,"These are super cute, and I want to love them, but sadly they do not fit. I ordered my regular size (12) as the description states to ignore reviews about items running small as it's been fixed...well nope they do in fact run about two sizes too small, or I would suggest ordering up! Also, these do not have any stretch to them. I returned, but may try ordering again in a size 16."
4.0,"Wasn't quite a perfect match for the color of my original lenses, but it is a perfect fit.  So happy to see clearly again.  My five year old glasses are like new again."
4.0,I bought this sweater for my husband for Christmas.  He looks great in it! The color is as shown and the fits great!
4.0,"5'6 145 pds, size small fit perfect.  I was a bit confused after reviewing all of the photos with the twist detail in the front because the dress I recieved had the detail in the back! Tag could have been placed on the wrong neck line, which prevented wearing as designed (reason for 4 stars). I would have been pisted of I had a few rolls to hide! Thankfully, I don't and have mastered the tummy tuck all day look."
4.0,Got it 3 days ago and put it on right away so far it's great! Sometimes gets stuck in my hair but definitely love it.
4.0,Bought these to wear at the hospital for delivery. Now they are great to wear around the house.
4.0,It’s a good product. Needs some breaking in. I really only got this particular one because it was the only one I found on here that I halfway liked.
4.0,"This fits perfectly in a ladies wallet but again exteremly overpriced for what you get and...maybe Costco will sell these soon, but until them it's supply and demand at a premium ($)."
4.0,"I love this dress, great material there is just one issue really, after wearing the dress once the stitching left a small hole at the back of the dress at the seam line, that i can fix but overall the dress is of great quality and style."
4.0,Works as advertised. I work the loading dock part time for Old Dominion. Winter time is brutal. I use them as a liner sock much better than a single sock alone. The fit could be better as in larger or longer maybe as a tube sock size.
4.0,The arch support was less than I was expecting but I would buy another pair when these wear out as they are very comfortable.
4.0,A little bit small.  Edges of money stick out.
4.0,"Gloves feel vinyl but were as expected for the price. My son likes them and wears them often, so I guess that's all that matters."
4.0,"Super cute dress. Love the split. My only complaint is that the material snags easily. The 5'7.5"" in the low 170s and ordered a large."
4.0,"Beautiful design. T-shirt material was not typical t shirt as excepted. Shirt was also cut a little smaller, so if wearing this for soccer mom duties size up!"
4.0,"This is a bright bold pink, not red at all. The material is very thin and shows my c section scar. Doesn’t attempt to do any control like most high waisted bottoms. These come up over hips by not all the way over belly button. Overall a cute fit. If between sizes, I’d say order up. Still not the most flattering of bottoms I’ve ordered on amazon."
4.0,The only thing this is missing is pockets... it would be complete with pockets.
4.0,"These pajamas are cute and comfortable.  They are a bit see through though.  The bottoms run a bit small.  I usually wear a small for bottoms, but bought the medium because I am well endowed and needed the top bigger.  The top fit as expected, but the bottoms were a bit tight."
4.0,My husband like the socks and they are not as difficult to get on as other compression socks. I have already placed an order for 2 more pairs. He is a size 12 M with a 17.5 inch calf. The Large fit perfectly.
4.0,"I got these to try because I have vitaligo. Love them.  I wish they stayed up a little better as they slide down to my elbow, but they protect my hands and forearms perfectly when I'm driving."
4.0,These are the cutest shorts. They wrinkle a bit but adds to their slinky linen charm.
4.0,"If you are in the process of losing weight and have a Bhuda tummy you would not be able to fit.  I wear size large T-shirt, and fairly fat tummy, it fits very snug on me.  I guess it is a motivation for losing more weight."
4.0,The fabric is nice but the top half is too big. I wear size 6 and I ordered XL.
4.0,Very nice top. Slightly snug in the arms. Scoop neck perfect for church. Pairs perfectly with multicolored skirts
4.0,The shoes are a little tough to get on and a little snug
4.0,"Runs slightly large, which is great to fit my orthotics.  Haven't tried them in full on spring puddles, but hope they truly are waterproof.  Seem well made, adorable designs."
4.0,Not as snug but comfortable
4.0,I love the shoes however it's really narrow.
4.0,I ordered the black...color seems faded but overall...love the dress.  Nice and long at the bottom as well.
4.0,"Good quality material, washes well. I ordered size medium and the fit was on spot. I'm very satisfied."
4.0,I love these dresses.
4.0,Very comfortable. Didn’t give a 5 due to the collar not staying folded & kinda smothers neck if stuff like that bothers you.
4.0,"They worked well, just not loud enough"
4.0,These shirts fit my husband great. There are a very comfortable light weight material. They do give that slimming effect but could give a little more of a squeeze. But overall a great buy for the 3 pack.
4.0,"I was surprised they fit.  I am a 32E, and sports bras are hard to come by.  Would not use for running, but other than that, comfortable for daily use."
4.0,"Great band, only one slight issue. The loops for the band are a little flimsy, not so much that they'll break off, but enough that it bends a lot and tends to catch the end of the band as you slide it through. An annoyance, but other than that, it's great."
4.0,Little tight on sleeve area otherwise nice item.
4.0,great chain we like it
4.0,I absolutely love this bathing suit! I did order a size up based on some of the comments and I wish I didn't because it was too big but I do believe that it was true to the size that I had ordered. I will be returning for my actual size
4.0,"Loooove this dress!! I received lots of compliments! The ONLY problem is the belt. It kept coming a loose. It, unsnapped a LOT. I had to keep checking to see if it was connected. It's not as cute without the belt. I will just replace it. Well worth it.  Maybe even add a pop of color with a red, blue, or some other color belt."
4.0,This is a cute outfit I purchased for my mom but the jacket rides up in back.  Short jackets are not for everyone.  😃
4.0,"took a chance on an unknown brand - glad I did. very good quality. especially nice with shoes that don't ""breathe"" as good as they should. would buy again."
4.0,"&#34;Quite frankly, I've tried those other colors - AND THEY'RE ALL LOSERS...&#34;  signed: Donald J. Trump"
4.0,This is a good non bulky watch. I like it because it's smaller and I barely notice it. Good buy. Only thing I dislike is it isn't water proof for a given depth.
4.0,The sleeves are just a bit too short. They don't reach my wrists. Otherwise this is a lovely blouse.
4.0,"The buckles are a little cheaply made but I really love the shoe. The best part about it is that it's vegan! I might replace the buckles later but for now, they're great."
4.0,I like the design of it. I did not like the fact that were too big for my son.
4.0,"This is just the cutest dress! Got a large it's a little big on the top, but so flowy. My only problem is trying to find a summer dress that's long enough. At 5'11&#34; it's way to short for my everyday/church wear. Cute for date night. Thinking about trying navy Capri leggings under it so I can wear it more. Wish I could find a dress that was just like this only 37&#34; instead of 34&#34;."
4.0,"This is really cute, made of a satiny fabric and has tons of stretch. I feel like the bottom hangs away from my body though. Maybe just because of my boobs? Idk"
4.0,They are comfortable but they do run a somewhat larger in size. I ordered a medium and I’m 4’10” and weigh around 140lbs. I’m really thick and it was a big loose around me
4.0,The color was nice.  It was way above the knee and goes up on the sides.  So I wore leggings with it and it looked great.  Very comfortable.
4.0,"I ordered this “cooking dress” to keep in my art studio and use as a smock so that I wouldn’t be relegated to old jeans and sweatshirt when i wanted to paint.  It does exactly what i needed it to do.  Long, elasticized sleeves protect my sweater sleeves and the smock is long enough to cover my lap and protect my clothes from when I get sloppy!"
4.0,I really love these but they are too small and fall out. The seller contacted me to send me a size larger free of cost! Can't wait to get them! 😄
4.0,"My daughter loves them! She loves sparkly so she's pumped to wear them! And I love that I got her 2 pairs! 🙂 The only thing I'll say is, we're a wide width feet family, so maybe make wide width shoes, too! 😁"
4.0,Cute shorts but 2 sizes too small.
4.0,Great play shoes for the kids. Easy on and off and easy cleaning. Perfect price
4.0,"First off let me say I gave these 4 stars because I was sent the wrongoing color. I ordered pink and received orange. I contacted the seller and was basically told it costs too much to send them back and reissue a new pair, which I do understand. I can't complain too much though as I received these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, so here it goes:<br /><br />These are SUPER light. Like you feel almost like you're wearing pantyhose. To me, that's a good thing. When I'm exercising or doing yoga I want clothing that is tight without being restrictive. These are super comfortable and don't cut into your abdomen or ride up the backside too much. They're extremely stretchy and feel like a second skin. I'm a big girl (5'11 size 16) and the large fit me just fine. I do like these and even though they're not the color I ordered I'll definitely still be using them often.<br /><br />Again, I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I always tell the truth in my reviews as I too am a customer and depend on others reviews."
4.0,"These  were exactly what we needed for cotillion, but unfortunately they were too small. My daughter is 11 and does not have very big hands. They fit my 5 yr old though."
4.0,"Nice belt, but I thought I ordered a black belt and got a brown and gold checkered version. I checked the recap of my orders and it says ""black + black."" However, backtracking further into descriptions, it links to a black version with a Superman S logo, yet the verbal says brown and gold. I ordered and got a buckle with a G logo. Would prefer black with the G, but I'll keep the brown and gold though it's not as versatile."
4.0,Best no show socks ive come across buttttttt they still show in a pair of vans.  Could be lower and/or tighter fitting.
4.0,"If you look at the photos, you'll see a product that is completely different than the product listing. Fortunately, my wife loves the version that arrived even more. They really do feel high quality, they look good on her, and she's really thrilled with them. They fit her perfectly.<br /><br />Typically, I would give 1 star when the product that arrives is this much different but because they really are good, it'll get 4 (docked 1 star for not matching the listing). The company should really update the listing."
4.0,Great fit. The only thing I didn’t like was the neck rolls after a few hours and looks weird. But it’s for and comfy. I would say more red than burgundy for the color.
4.0,"runs slightly big, but that is my only complaint! I've gotten lots of compliments in the few days I've had it!"
4.0,I feel like Katherine Hepburn in these sun glasses.  They are very classic 50s look to me.  Sturdy. Should last a long time.
4.0,These were pretty and did what they said but seemed very cheaply made.
4.0,I went a size bigger but don't need to order your usual size it will fit well
4.0,Material is thin and not a fan of the way it ties but I love the color
4.0,"I bought the style Black/Pink-side Pockets. I had to return the skort because it was too small. This design has only one pocket. It is on the side. There are no additional pockets, nothing in the waistband."
4.0,"A half hour after putting this on I noticed the strap came apart from the back.  Glad I carry a safety pin in my wallet. Very thin straps with little fabric attachment. I would recommend checking the straps before wearing and possibly reinforcing them or carry safety pins. Due to the flimsy strap, I returned it.  Since I really liked it, I ordered it again (navy dot).  The first one was more loose, but o.k. (large) so I ordered a size down (medium). I'm 5'2"" and had to wear<br />my highest platform sandals with the large."
4.0,"Lightweight and appear to hold the weights on securely.  I haven't used any heavy weights with them yet, but I think they will work fine."
4.0,"Good size, not too bulky. Kept a bunch, gave a bunch away. Everyone is loving them."
4.0,"This was a great buy. It is actually good quality which is surprising for the price. The only complaint is the shirt may be labeled a small, but it is definitely not a small. It is long and it is a bit wide. The shirt is very pretty, so I make it work."
4.0,"I usually wear a medium - purchased this in a medium. Super cute! It is a little big, but I love the oversized blouse look with the front tucked into jeans. Wish they had more color/designs - would definitely purchase more!"
4.0,"I got the largest size available because I'm tall.. I have super long legs! I'm like 5'7-5'8 and I've been looking everywhere for a long floor-length skirt as I'm going to a family wedding and have to be extra conservative (aka cover all my tattoos). I pulled up the waist a tiny bit but it's not as high waisted as I wanted.. if I pull it too much more up from where it's at then it's an awkward length. Either way, for the price it's totally fine.<br />I will say that the waistband is weird, but based on previous reviews I sort of expected that so I got a thick cinch belt to cover it and it worked out great. i actually expected the waistband to be a lot smaller based on other reviews but it's almost a tiny bit loose. I'm more of an athletic build (about 150lbs) so i hope this review helps someone who is on the fence! Also, its very heavy/thick skirt so its not cheap and see-through at all (i was worried about that). Might just be the weather but my only complaint is its very prone to static cling! Oh and pardon the pizza, I tried on my bodysuit with no bra. :) haha. This shipped Prime so I got it in 2 days as expected, I think it's certainly worth a shot if you're looking for this type of skirt!"
4.0,"Fits a little tight. I didn't wear it before washing so I can't compare it to how it was originally, though. My dad used this for Halloween but it's too tight for me now so I am giving it away."
4.0,The fit is great. It fit perfectly and there were no complaints on the fabric
4.0,"If you are like me and someone who uses hair straighteners and curlers almost on a daily basis and have had several clumsy instances where you burned your fingers, this is a must have more you. I like the extra protection when using hot styling tools and this product works great in protecting my hands"
4.0,"Fit just as expected. I ordered the blue, and it is more of a bright blue, not really navy like the picture."
4.0,"Seem to be good quality-frames are sturdy, hinges seem good, and the lenses have no obvious warping,<br />I've dropped them twice with no damage.<br />The only problem I have is that I got one pair rather than two. I apparently misunderstood the ad copy. They are good sunglasses but turned out more expensive than I had expected."
4.0,Color is not Gray. It's is like grayish green. I like it but buyer beware. I also noticed a green tint in the khaki one.
4.0,It's a very nice hoody.  I ordered an XL and it was a bit snug.
4.0,"Looks great, I try not to dry, though my husband has accidentally put it through a few times. Because of this it probably won't last a full year, but if you take better care of it, it's worth it. Keep in kind it's a very hot shirt so this is not for the dead of summer."
4.0,"It fits but I should have gotten a SMALL. The arms is a little big for me. I will have to sew them in.<br /><br />I am a size 34D, 28 waist. I usually wear a small but since I’m ordering it online. I decided to go a size bigger."
4.0,"I was thinking it would be longer, something I could wear with leggins. Really it's a cute top, perfect with jeans. It's not very long. I like it, and wear it often, it just wasn't what I was looking for."
4.0,Very well made. Only problem is the will not fit in the glass holder in my car.
4.0,Very thin fabric makes this dress cheaper than it shoud look. Felt like a million bucks because I had the right undergarments. Created a beautiful and feminine sillouette. I started to return this dress but I am glad I kept it.
4.0,Great fit and color. The material is a little softer than I like.
4.0,Love this purse.  It actually stays up keeps its structure and doesn't fold over when I have too much in it.  Only down fall is that the straps are too small to fit up on the shoulder.
4.0,Too many credit card slots and not enough hidden pockets.  I thought it was a smaller wallet when I chose it. But kept it because it was very nice looking and I  figured I would get used to it. Just got it. Not sure if it's  very durable. I would consider giving it as a gift.
4.0,"Cute for the price. I like that I have several to choose from. I have worn two and one did break when I tried to take it off. It can likely be fixed pretty easily, though. A link pulled apart. But they are cute and are perfect for pool, beach, etc."
4.0,"I really like the size, wish there was a dark brown color and I also wish I did not need to take my phone out to take a picture."
4.0,"Love the feel of the material. Size chart is spot on.. Im busty, but the fabric gives well. The only issue i have, and need to return dress, is that im short. Im 5'2, and the torso and length of the upper body is too long for my body,  so it bunches in the back. 😞 Bummed about that. Great prosuct for the money though.."
4.0,"Over all I am happy with product. The top is a little tight on the top band for me. The bottoms are way too large and oddly shaped. Luckily I had  a black bottom from another bathing suit to match it. I didn't want to spend a lot on money on a strapless, flattering top and this was perfect for that."
4.0,"Nice shirt.  Much longer on me than model.  I'm 5'3"".  Too much material on bottom."
4.0,"Fun esrrings, and not very heavy. The eye itself looks a little different than what I was expecting but in general its a good buy."
4.0,I just got the watch today. My initial take on the watch is that its stylish and easy to read...except for the stop watch minute section...it is totaly dark and not useable.  Why would you make everything else visible and not the stop watch minute hand?  I cant speak to accuracy or longevity at this time.  Will post an update as I wear it more.
4.0,I bought this to wear as a nightgown. I love it. The fabric is light & breathable which makes sleeping so comfortable.
4.0,might of preferred a longer chain. Giving as a gift.
4.0,Very lightweight and breathable .
4.0,"Exactly the title, super cute dress that I love for spooky season! It gets a little stretched and see through if you have a bigger chest."
4.0,"Great for the beach, fit is large as expected to be able to do some different styling."
4.0,Pretty but not as pretty as I hoped. Still very soft and light weight.
4.0,fits perfect  and very comfortable
4.0,Para el precio estaba más o menos pero estaba un poco más grande<br />De lo que esperaba
4.0,"I'm 5'7, 130lbs with chest size 34D and I ordered a medium. I shy away from posting pictures for bikini reviews just for privacy's sake, but this is a great swimsuit! I like the security of the neoprene, it stays in place. The bottoms are not cheeky at all, they have good coverage. The top was a tad small on me, but that was expected seeing as my chest isn't proportional to the rest of my petite frame. I'd say it runs somewhat small because I'm usually a size small in bottoms and medium in tops, and the medium bottoms fit perfectly, the medium top was small. Order a size up!"
4.0,"Liked it better after washing/line drying it.  Not as tight and itchy around ankle. Also, not as long in height. Was so hard to get over ankle where I have painful swelling, compared to a very expensive brand (twice the cost, but more natural color and more comfortable fit) recommended with Rx from my vascular doctor.  Will consider your brand again though, as everyday pair.  Worth trying again!"
4.0,"It is so light and soft! I just wish it was a little wider. Other then that I love it, I'm hoping it will stay as soft and fluffy after it's been washed"
4.0,"Perfect size, style and color.  Exactly what I was looking for but I wish there were more or bigger inside pockets."
4.0,Pretty color and did keep my head warm.
4.0,"Nice spacious bag for the price, love the little hip bag that's included ."
4.0,I loved the slippers. I normally wear a size 7 shoe and the 7/8 slipper was too big. My feet kept slipping to the front of the slipper. The slipper itself was very soft and cute!
4.0,"I think these pjs are really cute, but the material stretches out pretty quickly.  They don't stretch out so much she can't wear them, but they are kind of baggy by the morning.  But I like that I was able to find some 12 month footie pajamas made of lighter material, because they are pretty hard to find."
4.0,"Overall quality is not what I expected. Buckle looks very cheap - I've replaced it already with the one from original strap. The part that holds strap onto watch doesn't look very good if you compare it to original strap - tried to replace this one too... but found out that while the original strap has special steel/brass part that holds the screw, the V-MORO's screws are screwed into plastic/silicon so those parts are not compatible (or exchangable to be more precise).<br /><br />Update: customer service is very good and because of that I give it 4 stars."
4.0,Made a bit cheap but for a one time wear it is a good buy.
4.0,Didn’t like design on side of hat
4.0,Very tight in the chest.  The shirt is good quality for the price.
4.0,Decent for price
4.0,This was really big for a medium and bottom layer was thin material. Not my favorite
4.0,"Very well made, nice leather and a good price. Lots of room with well thought out compartments inside. Fits a laptop easily and has room for papers. Also works well for a carry on when traveling."
4.0,Un like mechanix brand these fit a little wide in the fingers and pinky is long. Im not turning wrenches with them just for fueling so decent glove for the money
4.0,"It is a good product, but if there is a dusk to dawn feature on the next generation, I'd ditch this. I find it odd that Amazon has lots of the same type of solar umbrellas. None of them have a dusk to dawn feature. I have to walk over in the dark and flip the switch on the light pole.  With a dusk to dawn feature, I could see my way to the umbrella. Someone please point a  dusk to dawn and I will buy it right away (looking to buy a relative one for Xmas)."
4.0,"This took over a month to arrive. I’m 5-10, 145 and ordered a medium in black.<br /><br />I really like this shirt - it works for me dressed up or casual. The fabric is a little on the rougher side of what linen can be, but it suits the shirt.<br /><br />I’ve worn this for a night out, to work with slacks, and just out running errands. I’ve gotten compliments on it. I’ve worn the sleeves down and buttoned up and also loosely rolled. I typically wear the neck buttoned up one or two - because of both the fabric and the more structured collar, it doesn’t fall open too much on it’s own. I now have it in two colors!!"
4.0,Cute to wear with tankinis! My mom bod appreciates these bottoms!
4.0,"for it to be an xl, it fit him a little bit small."
4.0,Wife used it for a Saint Valentines Party.
4.0,The material isn’t very soft
4.0,"Very pretty, but smaller than I would have thought. Good quality, just tiny."
4.0,While it looks great its not quite as good as some of my other hats. Made well but doesn't seem to keep its shape well. Yes I would recommend it to others.
4.0,"Really like them. I did not buy them because of the bra feature. Had I been expecting this, I would have been sorely disappointed because there is no liner at all."
4.0,"This sweatshirt would be great without the dopey sentiment. The fabric is soft and cozy. The floral motif makes a lovely accent. The sleeves flare adding visual interest. It has  cool, slouchy silhouette. The saying &#34;Love you, Lose Me&#34; is not clever, witty or especially meaningful. Too bad it is emblazoned on an otherwise terrific shirt."
4.0,"It looks perfect and so pretty, but the chain constantly snags my hair no matter what I try to do. Besides that, I love it!"
4.0,I still wouldn’t wear this out but I haven’t tried it on  with my slip which I love so thought is still pending
4.0,It did rust after about 6 months but I loved it and would buy again.
4.0,Really nice tank top but it is designed for very tall people. It is extremely long.
4.0,I wear a 9 1/2 or 10 Regular in women's shoes... sometimes even a 9 medium.  In these I wear a 42!  Depending on where you buy them from a 42 is a 10 1/2-11 or a 12!  These are SO cool!  I have the Grey/Limon ones and they are FANTASTIC! But they run extremely small so unless you want to send them back- Size UP!  I love them so much I've ordered the tangerine aqua ones.  Please carry Size 42 they are almost impossible to find.
4.0,"Made a cute Valentine’s Day gift (I put them in a heart box with a watch). Got these a couple years ago and my boyfriend still uses most of them! Only giving a 4 because some of them were a cheaper quality. However, for the price, we only had 1 or 2 duds!"
4.0,Good value. Fit a bit snugged than expected. Like a smaller large instead.
4.0,"This was a cute dress. It fit well and it was okay, but I found one that I liked better, so I returned this one."
4.0,Can’t return for a larger size
4.0,"Would recommend product for adults, put it on my 5 year old & had to adjust ear pieces & the fabric still a little bit can’t move too much around it it without slipping off the nose but if relaxed it can stay on for awhile.  Cute design tho. Good for Raya costume in a pinch."
4.0,Sport watch and tell time
4.0,Great bag for concerts and shows.
4.0,Very cute!  This will help me take my yorkie with me on trips (at least in spirit) :)
4.0,"Band met most expectations, I did find the buckle, proportionally, a little too large."
4.0,"Fits well, nice and warm."
4.0,"Smells kind of funny, but this goes away over time. Use it as a ballet dance bag and love it!"
4.0,"The fit was great. The quality looks good. However, I wore this in a pool for about 3 hours, and whenever my butt touched the pool wall, the threading on the bikini bottom got damaged. So right now there's 2 fuzzy circles on both butt cheeks, which look very prominent, so I can't wear the bottom again. I'm still trying to find a way to fix it."
4.0,Light and airy an overall nice dress. It’s not great quality but it’s good enough for the price.
4.0,I got these to work out in and to just wear about. When working out I felt really warm in these. They do not breath very well but to just wear day to day I think they will be ok. I am 5'9 and 185lbs and when I opened the package I didn't think that these would fit me but they are stretchy! They fit great around my waist but are a little tight around the ankles.
4.0,Use this to show off my SW pins when I'm at Disney. Has held up and I have no issues.
4.0,All my grandsons love sonic.
4.0,Very happy with this hat. I had no idea what to expect since this would be my first Bluetooth hat but am very pleased. It pairs easily with my iPhone and is surprisingly warm. The only issue I have is that it does bunch up a little bit in the top of the hat but I'm okay with that because it seems to help keep the heat in doing that. Sound quality is good enough for me since I mainly listen to podcasts. I used to wear Bluetooth earbuds but did not like the fact that I couldn't hear anything around me while walking my dog. With this hat I hear my podcast just fine and am able to hear what's going on around me as well.
4.0,"Fit is good, length is perfect."
4.0,"I liked these hoops a lot, my only concern was that the rose gold ones tarnished easily. Would still reccomend them because it's a good price for three."
4.0,"I always buy cheap sunglasses because I am constantly losing them.  For the price of these glasses, I was surprised with how nice they are.  The frames are cute and comfortable and seem durable.  The only issue I have with them is that there seems to be more glare with the lenses than I have had on other sunglasses, thus the reason for 4 stars.  But for the price, I think the value is there and I am happy with them."
4.0,"I am a major fan of Mordeiss clothing design.  I was excited to see their version on some traditional forms and fabrics this season.  I had hoped this could be a Spring/ Summer tunic, but unfortunately, it is cut for narrower hips than mine.  (A larger size would not have worked on top.)  However, it is so beautiful that I kept it to wear as an open jacket."
4.0,"I liked it, comfy and relatively well-made. Worth the purchase in my opinion if this is what you're into"
4.0,"Very nice watch! But the wings under the watch made it very uncomfortable on that wrist bone that is raised. Had to have the wings removed and a new band installed. As far as thr watch goes, its a great watch that is easy ti read, keeps perfect time, due to the multiband 6 atomic time keeping, it really does work well! The illumination at night is Super bright!"
4.0,Very warm as expected!
4.0,These are all super cute chokers but you definitely get what you pay for. They are cheaply made. Two of mine were broken when I received them in the mail. Luckily I still have four others to choose from :)
4.0,"I liked these earrings, but they are tiny.  Although the dimensions are listed, they seem very small on adult ears, mine at least.  They would not have shown up.  They are beautiful, though."
4.0,Great socks. Noticed after a few washes they are becoming loose and slide down my leg after about 12hrs.
4.0,I really like it. However when i got it there was no stone in it as pictured.  Seller was great and sent a new one really quickly.  Only disappointing thing was that after a week the stone fell out.  Still cute just a little off without a stone in the hole. It fit perfect for me but if you have a larger wrist it may not work.  If you can't touch your thumb to your middle finger around your wrist then this won't fit.
4.0,"I loved the fit, the quality for the price is great.....I did not rate higher because, the embroidery is much brighter in real life and for me personally the dress would be much better without the lime green. In the picture the green looks much more subdued, but it's really bright!"
4.0,Like the shirt but runs a little smaller than I thought.
4.0,"A bit tight, but good!"
4.0,Fits a little big and the color is more teal then green. However for the price it was worth the buy.
4.0,Look nice and feels good. Runs short. Will order next pair half size larger.
4.0,Muy buenas gafas y muy resistentes!!!!
4.0,"I was expecting some snug fit, but it was a little tighter around my bottom than I anticipated from the photo. Thought the pleates would fall a little more rather than follow the curves. But otherwise loved the color and had nice stretch"
4.0,I haven't worn them yet - still too hot in Texas. They appear to be nice quality and the color pattern allow lots of versatility.
4.0,"not as roomy as i’d like (i can barely fit an iphone 6plus, a thin wallet, and chapsticks), and the stitch work is a bit rough. however the option to wear this as a wristle or a crossbody is huge plus. great for the price"
4.0,Good heavy quality of ring. Design is a little off but overall couldn't be happier with this. Perfect ring to wear to the bar and show off our championship.
4.0,Very nice dress...love the color and fabric
4.0,"Nice shoe horn, but a little to flexible"
4.0,A little tight but they will do. The grip is nice.
4.0,They stay on my feet very well during exercise and are comfortable to walk in<br />It does take a few times to get the hang of getting them on your feet. I do wish they came above angle<br />No shrinkage after washing
4.0,"The hat itself is decent except i was sort of disappointed in the ""Thrasher"" graphic because it didn't look as nice or stand out as well as the online photo.  Nonetheless it was an okay buy for the money but not a new favorite for me."
4.0,It's comfy but i hope they make xsmall size. Smaill is not compressing enough.
4.0,The ear holes don't work well
4.0,"Super cute dress and fits like a glove. the sleeve and dress length are perfect as well.<br />The only cons I have are as follows:<br />A. The material is extremely thin. If you wear a bright colored or patterned bra, it will show through.<br />B. unless you wear a zero line thong or no panties at all, you will have very visible panty lines."
4.0,Love the dress! The ties are a little tricky but no issues. The color is just a little lighter than the picture but absolutely works. Would recommend! Fits great! Can’t wait for the wedding!
4.0,I could have used about 1/2 a size smaller but all in all they are great boots.
4.0,"Bought as a present, she loved it."
4.0,Works good for the beach
4.0,Very comfortable bras.
4.0,"Somewhat sheer, just wear a slip underneath. Seems to fit true to size. The flutter sleeves pop up when you move your arms forward/together tho. Cute dress tho."
4.0,"Bought this for my wife, and she seems to love it. It does seem a bit larger than I anticipated, but the cuffs help it maintain the baggy-but-comfortable fit."
4.0,"Depending on the time it can be hard to spot the hands at a glance, and the day of the week is always difficult to read but overall a good bang for the buck."
4.0,It's really pretty but luckily I have a short stature. Definitely not for women with a long torso.
4.0,"Looked exactly like the picture. I’m super satisfied with that. I ordered an XS, I wear a 2 normally and I’m about 106 lbs. The only downfall was the pants fit like a medium. Inconsistent to the top."
4.0,This arrived on time and intact. It looks just like the picture and fit as expected. It was reasonably priced for the quality.
4.0,It is a beautiful dress. Very little cleavage coverage!
4.0,"This is really sheer and seems cheaply made, but I wear a cami under it and it's super lightweight so good for summer.  Can't beat it for the price."
4.0,nice and nice value
4.0,"Nice shirt, soft fabric. Color is more day glo than expected."
4.0,fits great in some areas and sags in others
4.0,Really really cute but runs small so order a size up
4.0,"Purchased this as a gift for my mom as a Mother's Day gift, & she LOVES it!!!!"
4.0,Lindo vestido !!
4.0,Love this design! Mine isn't as bright as pictured but still love it! Came on time. Nicely packaged!
4.0,"It was solid and well made, but too heavy for the elderly. This one was a nice blue color, but the paint had chipped during shipping."
4.0,"I ordered this dress in white, dark purple, and black as part of an order of 6 amazon dresses, with intent of wearing 1 to my bachelorette party and returning the others. I weigh 140 lbs at 5'3 (small chest, big butt and thighs) and it fit well. I sewed the halter top a bit shorter on my final dress (black) since my chest is small and I was worried about showing a lot of side boob.<br /><br />Don't order white unless you want a see-through dress. I have a small black tattoo on my hip and it was completely visible in the white dress. This was disappointing, as I wanted a white dress for my bachelorette party.<br /><br />The purple is NOT dark, it is a light lavender color. It was not see-through, but was so light colored that it made my fair skin look pasty so I returned it as well.<br /><br />The black is not see-through and is a nice little black dress. I ended up picking this dress, despite the annoyance that the bottom rides up on my thighs as I walk. It looks very sexy, and though the material is thin the ruched fabric hides underwear lines as well as make the booty look nice. However, that ruched fabric is probably why the dress slowly rides up. I decided that beauty is pain and I'll be pulling the dress down all night."
4.0,"These are great 'stud' earrings.  Slightly larger than a true stud but when you consider the amount of workmanship [enameling and stones], the<br />size is right and impressive.  I wear a lot of prints and florals and wanted a simple but interesting earring that wouldn't clash with an outfit.  These<br />fit the bill nicely.  Although they arrived okay, I would have appreciated heavier packaging, i.e. a box or more bubble wrap to ensure the posts<br />wouldn't be bent or the stones loosened."
4.0,Great fit and comfort. They did start to fall apart a bit at the seam after a few watches but they are still in one peice and function well.  They also delivered quickly.
4.0,"It’s a good dress however it gets dirty so easily! And I mean extremely easily, it’s frustrating."
4.0,kinda low cut so I wore another cami underneath (same exact color) and that took up for the cleavage.. pretty good stretch ordered four colors..  like them all but the yellow is definitely see through... yes I would recommend and FYI my measurements are 38DDD waist 29(ish)hips/butt 39/40-- I don't MIND tight so it was fine BUT tighter than expected so that's why 4 stars but fit like it did on the model
4.0,"The watch is a perfect addition to my wardrobe.<br /><br />However, I was surprised to find the watch provides two languages for the day of the week. My instructions came for English and Spanish which would have been great, however, I received English and Japanese/or Chinese?<br /><br />Once you set your language for the day of the week the watch will automatically skip the unselected language; however, the watch will display the second language during the hours of Midnight-1/or2am. Which if you are up during those hours could be an inconvenience.<br /><br />Best of Luck!"
4.0,"The tie is very sharp looking. It is very versitile to wear as-well. You can wear a black, red, white or grey shirt. This tie has gotten alot of compliments."
4.0,Very stylish and comfortable. Goes with everything!
4.0,Cute! Engraving is not as detailed as I would have wanted but love it! Got my sister one for Mother’s Day and she loves it!
4.0,Delivered the shirt w a few minor wrinkles.
4.0,Cute! A little on the thin side though and shed everywhere. Great for a costume!
4.0,"looks good and works well<br />sharp shiny and eye catching<br />wish it was two sided, but will do the trick"
4.0,"Love the color and the pattern on this.  Nice light weight silk like fabric.  But it does fit rather small.  Once size fits most, apparently I am not most.  This is the second one of this type I have purchased, the first one fit better.  Not sure why.  I am not liking the tie up in the front, and the top is definitely not made for gals with a large bust.  Still I like it and will wer it often this summer!<br /><br />**I received this product for free/discount in exchange for my honest opinion.

4.0,Elegant watch with the black face.
4.0,Love the hat but runs very big.  My 4 year old has an average sized head and it's almost too big for him to wear.
4.0,"I like the shirts.  Reviews were somewhat misleading or I would have gotten XL.  I'm 5'8"" 183 and XL would have fit better but still able to use at gym."
4.0,"I’m 5’6 and 207 lbs<br />I ordered a large, fit comfortably but I’m a c cup size so the top was saggy and did not feel so secure. This is definitely made for someone with a bigger chest lol"
4.0,"Initial product was a little smaller than I anticipated (L/XL) and a ring from one of the side air vents had fallen out in shipping, so Coolibar kindly replaced it with an XXL hat. The new hat had a damaged brim from shipping, so I emailed a photo to customer service at Coolibar, and they are again sending me a new hat (no additional charge). I am extremely impressed with the service reps and their handling of the situation.<br /><br />I tried on the hats and everyone at the office was impressed with the style and look. I'm excited to get the final product in.  Material is a little fragile, so you it will have to be treated carefully when not on your head!"
4.0,Do what I hoped for.
4.0,I love it but I'm returning it for a larger size.  I am 5' 9&#34; and 150 pounds and the size 8 fits but is a little tight.  The sizing says the 8 is a large but I would call it a medium.
4.0,Nice hat. Doesn't slouch as much as I thought it would but still nice.
4.0,"It is what you expect. Nothing more, nothing less"
4.0,Runs really small... This is BARELY a large.
4.0,"I love this necklace! It is lightweight and looks pretty nice when I wear it on black blouses (you can't really wear it with many colors). I get compliments every time I wear it. The only disadvantage is that it broke after I wore it a couple of times, but I was able to put it back together. The quality is not the best but the price was great, so I guess that's something you can expect with this purchase."
4.0,"Very pretty, and functional. Difficult to get off, but that is almost always true of fingerless gloves anyway."
4.0,This dress is so beautiful. I felt like i was attending a red carpet event. The ONLY downside is that it gets scratchy on the arms after dancing and moving around so much.
4.0,"I had read the reviews left by others, but didn't listen.  I ordered my usual 8.5 and found it to be at least a half size too big.  The quality and style were beyond my expectations, however, so I give it 4 stars"
4.0,A bit tight at waist and bust. I could have used more material between shoulders and waist. I do like the color and length.
4.0,Very lovely and attractive bracelet with intricate details and lots of shiny crystals.  haven't worn it yet but I'm sure it will make a nice statement.  It feels a little a large on my wrist but I'd rather it large than tight and annoying.  Would not recommend for very petite women with unusually tiny wrists.  Though it could probably be made smaller by removing a section and re-attaching the elastic cords with affecting the design.
4.0,"True to size. Decent material, not see through."
4.0,Smaller than it looks.  Molle isnt the best and the material feels too thin.
4.0,Nice dress. But is too small. Im 120lbs 5'2 34 C and fit.<br />I order a small bit is too small i'll get a Medium.<br />If you like tight fit small could be ok
4.0,I purchased the black and white as well as the pink and white pair of socks. They came faster than expected and fits well above the knee. Only thing is it can be slightly see through when stretched amd sometimes the top rolls down a bit. But they are super comfy and I love them.
4.0,"Im 5’9 bout 195lbs 36-33-45.  I was expecting a thinner, cheaper more fragile fabric.  Instead its structured, almost brushed softness on the inside and the skirt is very pencil.  It was very comfortable.  The top doesn't have an obvious front or back.  But its super cute and sexy."
4.0,"Larger than I thought, but still nice."
4.0,Love the shirt just a little longer than expected.
4.0,Gave as gift & he loved it
4.0,so far so good and easy to use..
4.0,"These are very well made! A little roomy, but I actually like that since my feet are on the larger side."
4.0,It is very nice.  No dissapointment at all.  I do wish it had a standard clasp.  Takes effort to clasp and un-clasp.
4.0,"Pretty mask and seems good quality, but a little big. Straps are not adjustable, but we will make do for the party."
4.0,Very nice also
4.0,The ring is somewhat too thick for my finger. The purple color a little lighter thn the picture. But t fit perfect and I will use it sometime
4.0,good but it came a little broken. can be fixed thou
4.0,They are cute and seem to be well made but definitely run small. Also the straps are slightly higher than some mary janes. When trying these on daughter complained that the strap hurts because it touches her leg.
4.0,"They are pretty much what I expected. They are sort of cheap-looking, but now that I’m looking at the pictures again I should have noticed that before buying. They haven’t irritated my sensitive ears yet though so an extra star for that."
4.0,Awesome watch. Face is bigger than I thought but the stop watch amd alarm features are great.
4.0,"This is a great dress for lounging on a summer day, or even as a coverup for the beach or pool. It gets even softer when you wash it. I have to admit I was skeptical, and not entirely thrilled with the awkward smell that the dress had when it came out of the bag. But no problems with washing or drying. Product does run on the bigger side."
4.0,"Gorgeous. I have to fix it though because it broke in an attempt to move the tail for proper fit. That was just me being careless though. I recommend. Just a piece of advice, be gentle."
4.0,"I really love the design on this suit. It is bright and true to the advertised picture. I really cannot give it 5 stars, though, because it did not fit my daughter around her waist. It did fit her torso length-wise, but was very loose in the back and stomach. She is pretty petite for 8 years old (46lbs and 4feet), so this might be better for a gymnast who has a little more muscle. I really wished it fit my daughter because it is such a beautiful and fun suit!"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:c8c3e64bf456ec5210f26d0d1f7d110f]] The pink turns to a more vibrant pink in the sun and the blue turns to purple.
4.0,Too tight for my legs. The design is nice.
4.0,A huge  fan of Alice in wonderland
4.0,Not specific to my head it just fits a little funny. Overall as expected for the price.
4.0,"This thing is super comfortable and I will most likely get a bunch of different colors. I'm short but curvy, so it hits me probably a little below my calf. I've got a bit of a tummy and a large-ish chest and everything is covered. The vee in the front goes a bit deeper than I would prefer, but it's nothing a tank or off the shoulder tee can't fix. I was worried I'd look like the Penguin from Batman, but nope. I look like a normal human being in a really cute jumper."
4.0,"Socks for ""men and women"" alike. I ordered size small and still to big for me, and I am size 7. The upper part feels awesome, the compression does the job.  It is a shame that the bottom part is so large."
4.0,Works great; only negative is it is a little too large for my head but that's it.
4.0,This is a gift so i am not sure how they fit yet.
4.0,Cute and super soft. Ordered large. In 5'4 and it is short. But I like it short swim cover ups.
4.0,"I work in a freezer at work. I bought this to throw in easily and keep warm. I didn't really care what it looked like as long as it was warm. It was super cheap so I figured I'd try. Honestly, it is was waaaay better quality than I expected.<br /><br />I usually get a medium in coats that I want to fit over sweaters. I figured this would be asian sizing, so I got a large. It definitely fit like an American large. So, order your normal size. But the sleeves were too short on me, which is a regular problem with coats and my arms.<br /><br />Ultimately, it just didn't fit me right, so I'm returning it. But, had it fit, I definitely would have kept it. Quality is good, just didn't fit my body right."
4.0,feet
4.0,These work when you don’t need a full knee hi.  Not as soft or flexible as other brands but they work.
4.0,"The actual guitar pendent is nice, so I was very happy with that part. The gold chain that comes with it, is very thin and had a few kinks in it, so I ordered a thicker gold chain to replace the thin one that comes with it. Also comes with a bracelet (black thin bracelet), but it was a nice little gift."
4.0,Very nicely made.  Perfect for cool weather.  Not heavy enough for freezing cold.  Love the color.
4.0,"Very comfortable and form fitting. Just had to fix the sleeves, because they were too long. Other than that, perfect!"
4.0,"Bigger than I expected, but it does block the sun and fits easily over all my glasses."
4.0,"These are a bit bigger than I like.  My Great-Niece will love them however.  They are made well, and even in the box are lovely!"
4.0,"Just received this. It fits well (slimming look) and very comfortable (light & not tight) true to size. I am worried it might shrink in the wash, will update."
4.0,"I love the shoes, normally wear size 8 but reviews stated half size larger and runs narrow. No 8 was available anyway so I ordered the 8.5 which is good in length but certainly not narrow. The heel height is great and the color is exact with my Voach chalk bucket purse. I'll have to use some sort if enhancement for a better fit."
4.0,"After reading the reviews, I ordered a 2xl, and it fit as well as a misses size 12. It's a cute novelty swim suit."
4.0,"Even though some of the reviews said the material was awful, I think this is a cute little number.  That said, the material is very sheer, but suprisingly not sheer enough that you can see through it.  It will be a great spring/ summer piece.  The only complaint I have is that it seems to be too short for me, I ordered a Medium and would have been better with a Large as I am 5' 7&#34; and being a jumper, when I raise my hands the pants come up too, not comfortable if you know what I mean!  The top part is really well designed also, you can't really see that from the image because the models hair covers it, but it has a really nice neckline."
4.0,"This is a good replacement umbrella, but it faded really quick. In less than a year and a half, it faded so bad that it was almost a gray color. I am now buying my second umbrella after 1 year and 8 months."
4.0,"the quality is very nice, and these are very soft. some reviewers said that these were very low profile, and barely passed the ball of the foot. the photo also looked like they'd be lower than ones that i already have. that's what i was looking for. they did not fit me that way, and poke out of most mules that i own. bummer : ("
4.0,"COMPARED TO OTHER PURCHASES OF SAME TYPE OF ITEM, THIS IS OVER PRICED."
4.0,Greatmaterial
4.0,I liked this outfit because it's very comfortable on. Fits great.
4.0,"Good fit, could be better. Addidas has become somewhat inconsistent in their sizing."
4.0,"I think the shoes run a little narrow. I am 71/2 Wide or 8 regular. I bought the shoes 8 W and fit ok. The shoes are comfortables if you use to go to the store or things like like that, but if you have to walk for a long time the shoes are not comfortable."
4.0,These are the best hoodies you can buy for the price. Good quality.
4.0,I am satisfied with the dress. Fits nicely
4.0,"Cute but returned. I have a large bust and the extra ruffles were a little much. Also the cut on the leg was not very flattering. Not quite boyshort, not really regular cut."
4.0,"Nice belt, good price, all black, good delivery. Must loose more weight.  Bill Anderson Waist Not"
4.0,Cute little dress my daughter wears 24month to 2t in regular clothing and this 18 month dress fit good but she needs leggings or tights under. It’s cute for the price I’m happy with it
4.0,this is a pretty nice mask and it was really comfy<br />there were no loose threads and it came in awesome<br />I recommend to buy this
4.0,Festive socks. Fun for a gift
4.0,"super cute ! definitely runs small but i expected that ,i wanted oversized , im usually a medium and i ordered and XL and this fits like a medium.  pocket ripped while i was putting it on so be careful."
4.0,Good product with nice fit. Material quality is good though I think it’s slightly overpriced compared to other similar products.
4.0,"My Boyfriend got this ring for me as a promise ring, and I absolutely love it.  I have had it for two months now and the only thing wrong with it is that the underside of the band has tarnished a bit.  The stones are beautiful and have not loosened at all.  The ring takes well to fine jewelry cleaner which I use to help keep the shine up.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"
4.0,its a hardy case. I just wish it had compartment to hold cable and charger.
4.0,I like the hat. It fits OK. The top round part sticks up too high. The band is a little too tight. It covers the top of the ear properly. There is no button on top and that is good. I am still looking for a genuine glider pilots hat but this works OK for now. I got three of them because they are the best I have found so far. I am still looking for the genuine glider pilot hat in white. If Amazon would list the genuine hat it could sell a ton of them.
4.0,"This is a very beautiful pendant.It looks even prettier when natural light is shining on it. I am very pleased with the pendant , however , the chain that came with it is rather flimsy and had a rough edge on the end that I had to clip."
4.0,"I ordered these socks because I was slipping and sliding all over the place on my yoga mat and didn't want to buy a new mat. The grip on these is great, no more slipping and sliding, but they run a little large (I'm a 7.5 or 8 in shoes and they are large on me) and they are very thick/hot. I'm hoping after a few washings they will be a little better.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review."
4.0,I purchased these boots when there were no reviews on it and honestly wasnt expecting anything great. These Boots came in 5 days. The stiching is good and the finishing is good as well. You are getting what u r paying for exactly. The fitting is great.
4.0,I ordered a medium. It's a little big on my around the rib cage area right under my chest but I am pretty small around my ribcage. For size reference I'm 5'3 160 lbs and carry most of my weight in thigh and butt area. Length is great not too long and can wear with flats and it won't drag. 34 DDD bust. I would've probably ordered a small but the medium is ok.
4.0,My younger son like these for the convenience of use.
4.0,Bought for my 9 year old son.  He has worn them while playing and for some light hiking.  The insert came out of one of them but I put it back in and have not had any further issues.  Overall a good product for the cost.
4.0,"Made for a small frame, but I love the style."
4.0,"One or both of my daughters must have purchased this. They haven't asked me to return it, so I reckon they are pleased."
4.0,My daughter wears a 5 ordered her the 4/5 was huge on her so I exchanged for 3/4 still was very big on her croch and behind area. Super cute though
4.0,"These are pretty cute, but they are a little wiggly at the joints, and don't seem to be super strong. The lens also doesn't seem to filter that much, but they are large enough to cover most angles and look nice/don't look cheap."
4.0,"The color is beautiful and the dress is super soft.  I’m large chested and it fits a little tight through the chest, not horrible though.  I didn’t realize how short this was.  I have to wear leggings but this fall it has been perfect with leggings and a denim jacket."
4.0,"I little large up top, but overall pleased with the quality."
4.0,l love the look but it was a little small. I wish they came in sizes as I do have bigger calves than the average lady.  But good quality item!
4.0,"Not as loose as shown. Prefer 2 to 3 sizes up for same look, otherwise fits true to size"
4.0,Husband loves them only thing he wished was that the gloves had size options. He would have wanted a little bit bigger
4.0,"I love the rings. I bought two for my thumb, I should have gotten a size larger as they run a tad bit small but they look great anyways. Mu only complaint is that I a stone has already fallen out and Ive only had the rings a week. But I guess for the price you cant go wrong."
4.0,"Rather nice looking, comfortable gloves.  They are easy to put on; and, more importantly, easy to take off."
4.0,These are super cute but run small my daughter is a 9/10 So I got the 10 and will probably be to small in like 3 months I'm gona get these again bit a size up
4.0,"The pants fit well - a little large in the back but not too much.  The length is good for me - I am 5'3"" and around 175 and bought a size large.  The best part is of course the wonderful wide legs that flow and move... the pants really do look like a skirt!  The first day I wore them I had 3 other women stop me to compliment me on the skirt... my husband didn't quite know what to make of it!  Giving 4 stars only because care is more difficult than my ""wash and wear"" heart likes!"
4.0,So far so good. Took away husband smelly feet smell out of the house. Dried soggy boots in about two days.
4.0,This jacket is amazing and I have gotten so many compliments.  Very classy look!!! Only gave 4 stars because it doesn't have pockets
4.0,not the size I expected after going by the available chart. It is much too tight for me so it will be a gift for someone else.
4.0,"It's a pretty dress but even the adjustable string around the neck won't lift the arm holes high enough.  You basically have a choice: to show your entire bra from the sides, or to raise the waist up to your boobs.  Otherwise it's a gorgeous dress."
4.0,"I did like the product but the material was a little thinner than my other pants, still good just thinner. They ran a little smaller than my other pants same brand. Just get your exact size it has a little less give."
4.0,"This item also fit the bill. Though the straps were a bit tight, it does fit well enough that they won't fall off my shoulders.  The wings are a decent size, definitely not too large, they could stand to be a bit larger since these were advertised for &#34;Adults&#34;.  All in all the item arrived on-time, in perfect shape, at the right price, and will serve its purpose at the Terri Brodeur Breast Cancer Walk in October."
4.0,Super cute! Thin material but it’s cute for the price!
4.0,All  the items purchased to date met my expectations
4.0,Ran a little large so far but she will grow into them. My only complaint is where some of the stitching is on a few of the headbands is right out front and not as discreet as I would hope. Very cute though!
4.0,I ordered this for summer travel. It is perfect for that. Light weight seersucker is always cool. Only one thing I found that could be better is the the top of the pocket is not stitched down.
4.0,Sooo cute.  A little girlie but an 18 month as cute as mine can get away with it
4.0,Its longer than expected
4.0,Very sexy look.
4.0,"If this is the way an official one is made then good job, a little less detailed than the elder wand i got from the theme park. Overall good though, good shipping"
4.0,The extra large fits like a medium. Could not pull it up my leg at all
4.0,"Nice leggings, just be sure to buy them in a size up. If you don't want to spend a lot these are the ones to buy. Good for the price."
4.0,The fringes are too loose and falling out. Overall the dress is beautiful.
4.0,"I love the way these look, but they're very flat. I wish there was a bit more of a curve to them so they fit my face better. Truthfully, it's not THAT big of a deal, but for some reason it's something i think about every time I wear them. If you're sensitive to sunglasses and find them uncomfortable, these might not be the ones for you."
4.0,Came with a scratch on it.
4.0,The string/bow on the bottoms was in a weird spot
4.0,My daughter normally wears a size 8 & I ordered size 8-10. These are closer to a 6-8.  I don't think these will fit a size 10.  Good quality.  Elastic waistband
4.0,Beautiful I love it. Very good energy
4.0,"Very cute and sparkly. This is my third one. They do turn color after about 6 months and start to rust at the bottom. I am at the beach year round so I'm sure that doesn't help. Wish they were a little cheaper for the quality, but I like the size and style."
4.0,nice quality but a little large
4.0,"Got it for my girlfriend without asking her size. Risky.  I know.  But she liked it, but it was just a bit too small. I think the sizes are correct from what she said, but hey, I'm a guy. Material seemed sturdy and wasn't as wrinkled as I was worried it would be coming out of the bag.  Going to return it if I can and exchange for a size up."
4.0,I was using them for shopping too....
4.0,"I bought this one because my husband likes this style on me. I have a plain blue one from another brand, and it is a large, and fits well. Not tight, not too loose....like this picture shows the fit. THIS one is the same size as the blue one, and hangs on me. It is so loose I need to wear a cami underneath because I am afraid that if I bend over the ladies will show. Not see through, but it will show lacy undergarments, so if you do not like to show what style bra you are wearing, then go with a t-shirt bra. I really like the material, it is soft to the touch, and the wrinkles come out really quickly when tossed in the dryer. Cute on its own, or layered with a cami, sweater, or shrug. I tend to wear it with my skinny Jeans, and UGG boots, and jacket for fall, or just the shirt with sandals, and shorts for summer. (I am 5'4 with 36DD chest, bought L; should have gotten M)"
4.0,"These are a nice wardrobe building linen pant with a combination drawstring and elastic waist.<br /><br />Size-wise they may run a bit small; however, because the sizing is S, M, L, XL...,<br />you could probably get away with either your regular size or a size up,<br />depending on whether you prefer a more form fitting look or a looser one.<br />If you are someone whose body changes size due to bloating or what have you,<br />the elastic waist/drawstring combination is very forgiving, so I would recommend a size up for most women.<br /><br />When it comes to care, these are pretty standard: cold wash, hang dry.<br />Because they are pure linen, you do unfortunately need to iron them if you want the pants to look their best.<br />Still, that is true of all linen pants and shirts, so it's something you pretty much<br />have to accept as part of wearing linen clothing in general.<br /><br />The length is shorter than a regular pant, but nowhere near as high as a Capri.<br />Personally, I love this particular length/style because it keeps your pant legs away from moisture and dirt.<br />However, it is a matter of personal taste and gives these pants a more casual look; although...<br />You can dress pants like this up with a pair of tall or mid-calf boots.<br /><br />My favorite thing about these is the pockets because I am partial to them.<br />These are a nice depth and do not stick out too much, which can be a problem with pockets.<br /><br />If you're someone who prefers pants to skirts and dresses, these are a great warm weather choice.<br />In my opinion, the current price is a tad high for what you get, nevertheless, they would be a solid addition<br />to a warm weather wardrobe, particularly for those who like linen clothing in general."
4.0,"The pants are great. However I'm dinging one full star for that first - thumbnail photo for being very misleading by showing FOUR models in FOUR individual pairs of pants when in fact this set only includes THREE pants. Because of that photo, I got quite the surprise when I opened up my box to find the fourth pair MIA...<br /><br />I figured that last one just hadn't made it in the order, so before processing/replacement, I double checked the listing to be sure I wasn't mistaken. Boy, didn't I feel the fool reading the title (closely this time) & seeing it say THREE pairs?! Sure enough though that photo does show four models in four pairs of pants in the main photo; it's quite the little trick they're pulling here...<br /><br />Thus, be warned. I hope that photo gets adjusted appropriately because I hate that such a silly thing has tempered my enjoyment of these very well-priced-for-the-quality flair leggings."
4.0,"this is a cute cuff. I've been waiting for a while for it to come back in stock. as soon as it was, i ordered it. i'm glad i did. fits great. i get a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"Beautiful purse, especially for springtime but I'm carrying it now because I love it so much.  The only suggestion I would have is to add a zipper or a better closure.  I am always concerned about someone putting their hand in the open purse.  Although they added a hook in the center of the purse it's just not enough.  I would have given five starts for fashion, but left one off for security."
4.0,"This dress is a little see through when you hold it up but not at all when you’re wearing it. I got a lot of compliments on it! It is pretty short, I’m not quite 5’1” and it hits mid thigh on me and I got the size L. I would say if you’re in-between sizes, order up."
4.0,Was a very popular &#34;costume&#34; at work.  Fit was as expected. Very lightweight and stretchy.
4.0,"This dress is killer if you get the sizing right. The fabric is lightweight and has stretch. It has a glitter texture. There's a side zipper. The dress is a bit small on me so you can see it buckle. I found the fit to run small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,The description on my order said 4.5 - 5mm. I think mine are smaller than that..more like 3mm? Much smaller than I anticipated. They are real pearls and so far the quality seems good.  In my 3rd picture I placed the item next to a 6mm bead for comparison. I love that they gave the silicon earring backs along with the standard backs. These are cute little button pearl earrings but I wish I’d gotten the larger set as I wanted to give these as a gift. If you like minimal dainty then these are for you.
4.0,"I really love these shoes. They are so cute, really nice but casual at the same time. They look so cute with jeans. The only thing I don't love is that they are a bit tight where the shoe hits my foot/toes on the top, my toes are obviously squeezed in there. They get a little uncomfortable if I wear them for too long, but the good thing is there are super easy to slip on and off, so if I need a break from them I just slip them off and no one notices."
4.0,"This is definitely not sweatshirt material but a silky lighter weight material. I was pleasantly surprised though as it’s super soft and comfy. I accidentally spilled coffee on it and it rolled right off and didn’t even stick to the material, so no stains or marks. I was sure glad as I love the design and colors and glad it didn’t get ruined 30 mins after putting it on. lol The size is VERY generous! I’m 5’ft 110 lbs and it’s like a large on me and goes to about 2 inches above my knees. The bottom is not hemmed and just has a straight cut with scissors but doesn’t look frayed. Overall I really like it though."
4.0,Loved the suit but was too small.
4.0,"I like the gloves, the way they feel, and toughness of the exterior.  However, it fit a little small in the thumbs.  Fingers are long enough, but my thumbs are up against the end."
4.0,"Somewhat smaller than the picture looks, but very satisfied"
4.0,I love the dress. I read the reviews and took a chance. Many have said that the dress is thin but mines is not. The top of the dress does fit a little snug though. The problem I have is that I ordered the dress in orange but the dress I received is grey. The seller was very nice about the mistake and took care of the issue right away.
4.0,Nice size and pictures are fine.  The only problem is that I will need to sew or use brads to secure the handle because it was not attached.
4.0,"I'm between medium/ large and have a large round bottom. I went for the L/XL fit, but they are a little large for me. The work just fine though, and they are very warm and perfect for winter."
4.0,Gave as a gift and it was great
4.0,They are really beautiful.  Eighteen inches is not very long but I was able to extend the length and they are so reasonably priced.
4.0,"I'm a size 14 and ordered an xl it fit perfectly. I was surprised by the quality of the fabric after reading other reviews. It's much better than expected. Only 2 small cons I can think of, the strong chemical smell that as others have mentioned that will come out the the wash and the fact that it was so tightly bundled in the packaging that the wrinkles in it are deep and will need to be pressed even after washing."
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife:) These jeans have a cute bell-bottom style.  The material is stretchy and forgiving.  I like that the waist is a bit on the higher side so I don't end up with muffin top.  My only complaint is that they run a bit long.  I am 5'5"" and these jeans hit the floor.  I have to wear boots with heels in order to wear them.  These would be great for someone on the taller side."
4.0,Pretty decent fit...especially for the price.
4.0,Nice product little light on the chain but for the cost it was great
4.0,Comfortable and good quality. The color is darker than in the picture.
4.0,Bought this dress in a small for my daughter. She is 5’3 and a size 4. It fit her good just way too long. We have that problem often so I already knew we would have to have it hemmed. It would fit someone size 8 too.
4.0,It's NOT white!!! It's more of an eggshell color
4.0,Took t-shirt  out of packaging and it is huge but nice will use as a night shirt
4.0,"I am in love with this dress! The Print is very clear and vibrant, the fit is a little baggy where it shows it’s more fitted in the picture but not an issue at all. It IS kind of see through because the fabric is thin, however it is string fabric.<br />The only thing I see as an issue or “I wasn’t expecting that” was there are no under layers at all, so the skirt just kind of hangs off my hips, and the static makes it cling to my legs. I will be trying different undershirts to see if I can get it to sit like an actual swing dress, but if I can’t, I’ll have to find a different one..<br /><br />Still, freaking GORGEOUS dress."
4.0,Loved it.. it was a little too long for my wrist but i adjust it
4.0,My neice loved it and thought they were really comfy.
4.0,I ordered a Medium based on the size chart and Amazon did not steer me wrong. It fits perfectly. It’s just the right length and the color is very similar to the picture.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars cause I’m unsure of how it will hold up with continuous washing/wearing. But only time will tell.
4.0,"If you want a more fitted fit, choose your normal size. If you want them to fit like true joggers, size up! I’m 5’9 and 140 pounds and wear a size 6 in pants, I ordered the Medium and they were too fitted for me, sized up to a large for a looser fit."
4.0,"Very cute glasses, however, the arms are too long.  Wish they fit my head! Definitely cute!"
4.0,"So I wasn't quite sold on the whole blue light glasses but decided to give it a shot since I was constantly suffering from tired eyes. There is a BIG difference between how our screens appear to our eyes without these lenses vs with them. The glasses are comfortable and are great at protecting my eyes from the harsh glare of the screen, the only thing that I would say was daunting about them is that they don't clean easily and have a foggy appearance like something's stuck on them. I'm not sure if that's because of the coating meant to protect my eyes or not, either way they're a great product if you want to help reduce some of the strain on your eyes."
4.0,Slightly large but a great looking shirt. I'll buy more of this brand/line
4.0,"The fit wasn’t great, so i returned it but i do think it’s an adorable dress."
4.0,"I'm 5' 2"" and 120 pounds. And I'm usually a small in USA sizing. But this costume in a small was way too tight because it's Asian sizing, which I didn't realize until after I ordered it....It looks so cool on, but it's so tight! Even if it was the correct size, it's still like a second skin. And you can see EVERY curve and nook and cranny! There's not much you can hide. I still recommend it though, just make sure to check the size chart first."
4.0,"cute shirt, but does run a bit on the smaller side."
4.0,Boyfriend likes this wallet but wishes it had a rubber band both ways to reduce risk of loss. That being said he is using it everyday and doesn't seem to be as messy to me.
4.0,"Material was more stiff than expected. 😕 I purchased the same exact jumpsuit, but via a different company here on Amazon that costs only $4 more and it was like night and day difference in quality."
4.0,"Good quality, but unlike the photo the lenses are not green but black."
4.0,Product looks great hopefully it fits
4.0,Great shirts at a great price
4.0,This bag was worth every penny!
4.0,"Great little rain coat.  I'm a size 4 and it fits perfectly, but someone who wears a size 6 or 8 might have a hard time.  It smelled pretty strong but after leaving it out overnight, it's not bad.  Now I just need some rain!"
4.0,There is some funky bunching around the waist line but it was a fabulous dress for a gala. I'm 38 and out of shape (size 12) but felt comfortable and feminine in this dress. Everyone complimented me but I have a low self esteem and think they were blowing smoke.
4.0,The embroidery and fabric is gorgeous but the fit is very small. I ordered the largest size and I am an XL in shirts and 14 in dresses (largest size did not fit). I would estimate the largest size fitting snug on a size 10 and nicely on a size 8. I highly recommend if you are within that size range!
4.0,a lot of bang for $
4.0,"I am 5,3” and 110 lbs. I bought it in a size small. It definitely had some extra room in the shirt however, the shorts fit perfectly. I tried to shrink the shirt a bit so it had more of the fitted style I like but it is unshrinkable lol. Not complaining, it is comfy for sleep and I really like the wine color!"
4.0,Very cute emoji party wine glasses charms! Good price and perfect on wine glasses.
4.0,Looks great on my girls pedicured feet.
4.0,"The material is great, color is perfect.  Just wish it didn't have the logo on the back of the neck."
4.0,I got this in its largest size XXL. I’m 5’5 and 264 lbs currently. It fits but is slightly on the smaller side. Going to be honest - I’m not using this as a cover up but as a cardigan haha. It doesn’t strike me as a coverup. It’s essentially a basic short sleeve cardigan I can throw on with a tank top or whatever. The material isn’t very soft. But I like the look of it.
4.0,"Looks good, nice for the price"
4.0,It fits. That is all
4.0,"This item is NOT TERRY material. It has been mis-titled. 60% cotton, 40% polyester. Fits 14 to 16, tent-like shape. Very comfyo & roomy. Material is heavier than expected but is adequate."
4.0,The bracelet fit well and I love it!
4.0,"It’s a really cute dress. Everyone that saw me and loved it. I am 5’2 and 132 pounds and the dress fit not too small  but enough in all the right places I am a girl with a little bit of a booty in the back. It will touch the floor if you are not taller like the model so just be aware, my dress fit me enough to where I could wear it with flats but it would probably be smarter to wear with heels."
4.0,Like the purse but the strap hook broke the second week i was using the purse
4.0,Cute owl earrings
4.0,I have been very pleased with these smokey quartz earrings.
4.0,"It’s a nice little wristlet, pretty much what I expected. Nice for evening or casual depending what you are wearing. It can hold my phone, id, and a bit of makeup. My only complaint is that the zipper often catches on the lining if I zipper it completely open."
4.0,looked really small but but fits just fine top and bottom.
4.0,"All of the reviewers said to &#34;buy a size larger&#34; than you would normally wear, so I did.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 120 pounds, and I usually wear an XS, so I ordered a SMALL.  I'm sure I'm the only reviewer to say this, but it looked a bit matronly for my taste.  It's a good standard cardigan, but I guess I like clothes that are more tailored.  Think &#34;church cardigan&#34;."
4.0,"While this may not be a solution for everyone, nor is it perfect for me, so far it beats any sleep mask that I have tried.  I'm a small person, so the fit is fine for me.  It provides a good amount of room darkening and is comfortable.  My problem with all the masks I've tried is that they shift when I sleep or the seams and band are uncomfortable.  I find nothing uncomfortable about this.  While it does shift when I turn, it is still big enough to cover my eyes for the most part....depending on how restless my night is.  It also keeps my hair out of my face which is something else besides the light that bothers me when I sleep.  So aside from needing a minor adjustment occasionally, it sure beats all the sleep masks I've tried or the pillow over my head!"
4.0,"Super cute!! Arrived very quickly and had to put them on right away, :)"
4.0,Great exercise pants.  Fit as expected.
4.0,"I disliked the 15 days delivery time.  However, I like the product and will be ordering more."
4.0,Nice and soft but to as breathable as the other WSS that I own...made from a different type of fiber.
4.0,They are thicker and warmer than I expected but very comfortable and easy to wear with boots.
4.0,"They were nice, but I didn't receive any 'A's, but got double the amount of 'V's other than that they are sturdy and look great imo."
4.0,"Pretty comfy and lined, helps for taking walks in Texas' winters.  Could be a linger longer."
4.0,It’s a lovely Blouse.  Material is really pretty.  Just runs a little bigger than expected.  But I’ll be keeping it.
4.0,"Order 2 sizes up. I normally wear a medium, but ordered a large to be safe and really needed an XL. However, it was still very well made and I just had to suck in my gut to wear it."
4.0,"The jacket is great, very good for Colorado winter.  It was too small for my grandson, and we seemed to have trouble returning it so I passed it along to someone who needed it."
4.0,"pUrchase for an 18 hour plane ride, worked very well.  Fits good and is comfortable"
4.0,I like it. Comfy and easy wear shirt
4.0,Good jeans comfort
4.0,Fits as expected. Very comfortable. Pretty yellow but it's a bit see through so I will be returning. It's also too long.
4.0,"No doubt the watch looks fantastic for the price, and the fact that the chrono works so well is just icing on the cake. For a budget watch, you really can't go wrong here. I'm excited to see what I can do with a couple other strap combinations. The strap they included is pretty high-quality in that it has the bit that goes under the watch itself to keep your skin from rubbing against metal, although the strap is quite short for a NATO strap. It runs smooth and quiet and does the job well. A bit large and flashy for a daily beater but fun to mix in to my normal rotation."
4.0,"Slit goes up pretty high, had to stitch it some of the length closed."
4.0,"Nice shirt, it is that soft tshirt material."
4.0,"I ordered a large, it fit well."
4.0,"These fit right, are made well enough they last well.  They do get a bit loose around the leg openings after dozens of washing and wearing cycles.  For a big man a safe and comfortable choice."
4.0,Tough material has worn well.  I cut straps off and use suspenders.  One star off for smallish pockets.
4.0,"Bought these to wear with a long shirt/sweater dress and leggings.  They are comfy but I wouldn't wear them out when it's raining, out in snow or ice - they are flat on the bottom and quite slippery!  Otherwise nice for the price"
4.0,"Cute necklace! It is cheap so don't expect to receive a beautiful golden chain, it's great for costume jewelry."
4.0,"This is a surprisingly nice trench coat. As others have noted, it’s pretty well made, but of course it might not stand up to normal wear and tear - not that I would be normally wearing this! The color is a deep red or burgundy. These things from China are always difficult to size, so here's the ""skinny,"" as it were. I ignored the chart in their pictures – whoever created it is smoking crack; none of the measurements make any sense – they look like boy’s sizes at best. The Amazon size chart is little better – it doesn’t match me in either the chest of the waist. I’m 6-1 and 210 lbs. Chest is 44-45”, waist 36 plus a fraction. Men, you and your significant others would consider me “normal looking,” and maybe suggest I lose 5-10 lbs at the most. I got the XL and it fits close to perfect in both the chest and the sleeve - I therefore marked this ""fit as expected."" I do note, as others have, that the bicep is a little tight. I thought maybe it was the corded binding, but that’s not the case. I’ve got decent but not huge biceps so this isn’t an anomaly. Although there’s decent breathing room in the chest, not sure I can wear more than a regular shirt under it (that is, no light jacket, although a vest should be OK). One star off because it’s got a somewhat rubbery smell that hasn’t faded after 24 hours out of the bag (not horrible, but something you might notice)."
4.0,"I liked this dress more than I thought I would. It is very comfortable and very stretchy in the chest area. I have a large chest and to get dress big enough for my chest, I usually look like I am wearing a tent. But not with this one, still felt that I looked like I was wearing a smaller size. Flattering for sure."
4.0,"It's of very good quality, however I am on the smaller side, and the small is very big on me, I weigh about 110, and am 5'3 and I am swimming in the dress which is super disappointing. I have washed it about 5 times hoping it would somewhat shrink, but it has not and has also not faded or taken away from the texture of the dress,  which speaks a lot for the quality.! So it's of great quality just big on the size, I recommend ordering a size smaller than norm,"
4.0,Very soft. Size as expected. Appears to be good quality and only gave it 4 stars because I’m unsure of how it will hold up.
4.0,Very comfortable and stylish.  These are perfect for me.
4.0,"This was perfect for a beachy weekend get away. the romper looked as it does on pictures and fit quite well too. The fabric was a bit &#34;plastic-y&#34; but for the price and occasion, it was great!"
4.0,"Got this as a gift for my daughter when it went on sale. She's a huge cat woman fan and loves it. She loved the design and the wallet layout except for not having a slot for bills, just the zipper. I saw it; it looks really nice. I deducted one star because it did not come with the ears. Not a big deal but that was the way it was pictured."
4.0,Nice little watch. I am using it for travel purposes. I would have given it 5 stars but no documents came with the watch ( like battery type replacement) and it was running so who knows how long the battery will last. I recommend the seller.
4.0,Sizing was a little bigger then hoped.
4.0,I ordered 1x thinking it would be a little large. It fit me. I'm glad I went with the larger size. It is comfortable.
4.0,Mala envoltura
4.0,Not leather. Decent product.
4.0,"I have purchased a few Ellazhu items and this is by far my most favorite! Colors are just as pictured as is the fit. A bit shorter on me as I am 5’6. Only drawback is it is 2 different color schemes of material sewn together but they do show that in the picture. I would have preferred one or the other. That is the only reason I am giving 4 stars, otherwise, I love the dress and highly recommend!"
4.0,"Great quality, however, size was bigger than expected, so I recommend ordering down a size."
4.0,There pretty but there huge
4.0,"I really like this hat, despite a small defect that I discussed with customer service. After admitting the defect, they were not helpful (I deducted 1 star) and instead they passed the responsibility back to Amazon(unlike most other suppliers). They also don't return email(I tried twice). Other than that it is a nice item that does send a small but cool breeze when in the sunlight. Being good with electronics I might consider installing a small battery pack with a switch to change to battery power in the absence of sun.<br />Update 07/19/16, I modified the hat by installing a battery pack inside with a switch that changes between solar power & battery power(see photo). So now I get cooling air even in the shade or inside. Also, the solar cell only puts out 1.5 volts to the fan motor(I measured it) and the battery pack using 2AA batteries, puts out 3 volts which turns the fan twice as fast and therefore moves twice as much air for much more cooling effect. In my opinion the motor will handle the extra voltage. The battery pack and switch fit neatly in the inside band within the hat. Now I like this hat much more."
4.0,Super shine and really pretty!!
4.0,I absolutely love this jumpsuit its soo comfortable and fits perfectly. The only issue is there was a teeeny tiny spot on the front that looks lighter than the rest. I was going to exchange it easily but I already wore it and washed it. It's not that noticeable but something small I noticed. Other than that I want one in every color!
4.0,"I'm about 5'3, 136 lbs. My measurements are about 39-28/29-37.5. I ordered a size Large, in the pink with white flowers. I ordered size large due to the Asian sizing. It fits pretty well! The arms were not too small, as some users here have been saying. The length reaches the floor when I am barefoot. The quality is great for the price. It doesn't feel thin, and is thick enough.<br /><br />I docked a star because when I received the dress, there was a long pen mark across the chest. It was easy to remove, just annoying."
4.0,"I’m 5’10” and 140lbs, I got a small but I should have gotten a medium since they’re a bit tight on the waist"
4.0,"I love the coat, but the zipper keeps separating. At first I thought I wasn’t inserting the end in far enough. But the zipper is dysfunctional. Of course I realized this after the return date. Now I’m going to have to find and pay a seamstress to replace the zipper. 😖"
4.0,"This is a smaller purse, which is what I was looking for. It has lots of pockets and it holds my 7&#34; Kindle. The only complaint is the side pockets are not big enough for a cell phone, although they do hold small doo dads. The leather is soft, and I love that the handle is adjustable and works both as a shoulder strap and a cross body strap."
4.0,Color is as shown.
4.0,"Just a little bit small around the shoulder and busy area, otherwise love the dress!"
4.0,"My husband has 11W feet and often does the &#34;order a half size up&#34; trick. That trick doesn't work with these shoes, they're still too narrow. We sent back the 11.5 (in the colour he really prefers) and ordered the 11W (in the only colour they make them in, black/silver which isn't ideal) and those fit fine. He's a distance runner and seemed to enjoy his first run in these shoes."
4.0,"Very pretty, but didn't fit on my galaxy watch"
4.0,"Daughter couldn't wear one of the bracelets, because it was tighter than the others.  She did like all the colors that came, which we had no choice on.  Shes happy and if 5 of 6 worked for the price, I think thats a much better deal."
4.0,Very elegant. Box could have been larger as edges of hat were rolled up due to being stuffed in small box.
4.0,"I liked the cape overall. It is not the most expensive of fabrications, but at this value, it is a trend I can try out with little commitment. I haven't worn it to work yet. But excited for response."
4.0,I like the cap but a little small for one size fits all.
4.0,I like it in that it is well made with quality material.  I wish the purple color is more vivid so that it doesn't appear brownish under certain lighting conditions
4.0,I like this product.  I’ve tried several other cork sealers for my Birkenstocks.  This is the best yet.
4.0,"I ordered this for my daughter in a medium.  She is a full 33D, 5'2 and 120 pounds.  The medium fit her perfectly and looks adorable on her.  I was really hoping this could be worn as a dress, but it is pretty short....<br />otherwise adorable.  Will probably order another color!"
4.0,"For one of the gems covering the words I think they used the wrong kind, so its more shiny and cloudier then the rest."
4.0,I love almost everything about these shirts except I wish the sleeve length was longer!
4.0,Haven't worn these yet but tried them on.  A little thinner than I hoped for but they will be good under long tops or short dresses.  Very stretchy material and I think they will launder nicely.
4.0,Kinda pricey but it's nice.
4.0,"Fits comfortably. As described. I am a satisfied buyer.<br />I am 5'4, 185 lbs. These are extremely comfortable and are great for office attire. I bought these is various colors because they are worth the price.<br />Wish I’d opted for the XXL"
4.0,"For the money, it is a great product. The material is not of a high quality, but it is light, and comfortable. The one star less is for the fit. Got an XL one for Husband, but it  is small for him. It is also short, down to just above the knees. Also, the first time I washed it, it shed, so to say, some cloth all over the rest of the laundry. No such problem anymore, though, after the first wash. I use it now, and I'm happy with it."
4.0,"Cute jeans, heavier material but still very comfortable"
4.0,SUMMER  FUN
4.0,I felt like they are too long for me. I’m 5’2” and 140 lbs and got a Medium. I wish I would have purchased the Medium cropped. But the products is good. Very soft and comfortable.
4.0,"Fun little purchase.<br />Gold tone, the leaf pendant is textured differently on each side. One side looks like a leaf and the other resembles a fat feather. The leaf was a bit wider than I expected, but still looks nice.<br />The chain is thicker gauge than I expected and include s a two inch chain extender. However the chain extender is useless because the lobster clasp is so tight I could not open it to adjust it. The trigger seems frozen. Fortunately the chain is long enough to fit over my head and I can wear it they way.<br />Necklace measures 16&#34; from leaf tip to clasp.<br /> Overall: cute necklace, good thing fit over the head because unfortunately the clasp did not work."
4.0,I almost returned these because it said XL on packaging & shorts. But they actually fit perfectly.  I ordered size 30.  Thank you.
4.0,"Very nice looking scarf, for the price this was a great buy!"
4.0,"these are good blue  light filter reading glasses. the blue light filter isn't as dark as a previous brand I'd had, but they do the job and the frame style is much more comfortable and doesn't feel like it will break in my hand every time I pick them up as my others did."
4.0,"This bag is just what I was expecting. It has a moderate size, a side pocket to put in the keys or anything that small, and a front pocket to put in a wallet or things you need at your reach.<br />The material is great, and the strap is long enough for almost everyone.<br /><br />I took it on a two-day trip to the country, and I was able to fit all the personal care objects I needed. It is very durable and resitant. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it gets dirty very easily, other than that I would strongly recommend this bag."
4.0,I used them on the end of a charm bracelet recieved a lot of compliments. Highly recommend
4.0,"Silver<br />I loved this band, it was so cute and unique. The only issue I experienced was the chain tangling regularly, which didn't bother me.<br />Got home last night and noticed when I took it off to put the watch on the charger, one of the ends was missing and the chain came thru the connector when I tried to put it on this morning.<br />I only had it a little more than a month.<br />Don't think I'll get another one"
4.0,"Quality could be better, good for price"
4.0,it fits well and lasts for several months of use
4.0,"This band was so much better than the standard silicone band that came with my Fitbit!  The silicone one was a wide band that made by wrist uncomfortable because it got so sweaty during the heat of the summer.  This band did allow my wrist to be a little sweaty, but it quickly dried out and didn't damage the band in any way.  A+ for comfort and affordability!"
4.0,Not sure how graphic will hold up to laundry
4.0,"XL, goes down to mid calf, thin material can see dark underwear through the grey ones. Other than that, great for the price!"
4.0,"Well made and very reasonably priced clip-ons. They do an excellent job of blocking the suns glare in gray or brown color. I was going to send them back because of the way they fit on my glasses. The top stuck out half an inch and the lenses went straight across my glasses instead of curving back like most eyeglasses do. They were just the right width and the lenses were the perfect size to match my eyeglass lenses but the fit to my frame was awful.<br />I decided to try and bend one pair to fit my glasses. The lenses are riveted to a small metal rod that runs through the nosepiece. It took several minutes to bend the rod but I was able to fit the lenses to my glasses perfectly. I took off one star because I shouldn't have to bend them to fit. See before and after photos below.<br />I see several comments about them being difficult to put on and moving on your glasses. Nothing could be further from the truth. These clip-ons can be attached or removed with two fingers whether on your face or off. Squeeze the clip with your thumb and forefinger and they slip on or off instantly. When they are attached, the clips hold like superglue. No slipping or sliding here. If the lenses came shaped to fit like my second photo I would give them a 10."
4.0,"I'm giving this a 4 star because the product is amazing... just not on my body!  I loved the charcoal grey one (way more forgiving)so I ordered the pink... not so great on me, even though I'm a size 6.  TO EACH HIS OWN ---  my opinion, stick with the darker colors"
4.0,"My 4 year old grandson inherited his father's obsession with transformers, and that is all he wanted for Christmas.  When he opened his Transformer watch he was absolutely stunned.  He had to have it on his wrist immediately.  I was so glad that there were enough holes in the band that it fit perfectly around his tiny wrist.  It was his favorite gift, even more than the large number of regular transformers he received.  He couldn't wait to wear it to his pre-school. The only negative is that it was hard to open the face cover initially.  We are hoping that it loosens eventually.  Grandma's gift was a hit!"
4.0,I bought this dress for my mother in law and she loved it. Runs a bit small she wears size L and bought XL .
4.0,Looks good. Fits good. Wear it to gym classes.just hoping it won't fade fast in the chorline.
4.0,"i love how soft and comfortable these shorts are! i’ll be buying more in other colors for sure. they aren’t super tight compression shorts, and they roll a bit when sitting which is why i gave it 4 stars. other than that, they are perfect!! they fit a little smaller than expected, and i went a size up!"
4.0,This thing is awesome! The only downside is that the weave is not very tight on the fabric so it is not that warm
4.0,"I like my new black sandals, they fit perfectly but I have a big disappointment regarding the way they were packed in the David Tate box. They look like they've been previously returned by somebody else, and when they repacked the sandals, they forgot to pack some important thing (to me at least), the two individual bags to protect the nubuck. The black ones have bad reviews already, because the black color becomes pretty fast kind of whitish. I had the chance to order another Nelly espadrille sandals a couple of months before, which unfortunately I had to return,  so I know how it has to look a pack made with care for the customer. So I wonder if you could send me the bags to protect the sandals, so I could really be happy with my buying.<br />Thanks,<br />Doina Boca"
4.0,"Very cute and comfy. I'm 5'10&#34; 160lb and ordered a large which is my normal size for long sleeve tops. It fits well and even the sleeves are long enough on me, although understandably it is a bit shorter on me than some of the ladies in their photo reviews. I still rock it with some thick leggings though."
4.0,These are good tights for dancing.  They fit perfectly on our daughter.  They move with her don't seem to bunch up which is much needed for her dancing.
4.0,"Reef tends to run a bit small. Order 1 size bigger than normal. I have owned a pair of reef sandals for a few years, and I really like them a lot. After a few years of almost daily wear, they are ready for replacing."
4.0,Looks like I hoped and fits well. Great price
4.0,"This fits more than just one size too small, more like 1.5-2 sizes too small.  It is tight on me in the shoulders and hips.  I am 5'4&#34; and a Medium/Large (10/12), I ordered the XL and it is tight on me.  It is also very see through, so anything you wear under will be very visible, as in they can see the patterns.  The embroidery is nice and very deep color."
4.0,Too big for my toddler but she still loves them
4.0,Loved the movie but the case is sadly a bit flimsy compared to other steelbooks
4.0,"Sweater is lighter in color than on amazon picture, runs a little big. I’m usually a medium but I ordered a small and it fits great. Also very soft."
4.0,Why are you asking this when you have to cut it to the right length?
4.0,It fits but the chest is way to tight.
4.0,"Super cute, but the color is more green than it looks in the picture. I thought it would be like a grey blue/denim blue but it has more green to it."
4.0,"This is the perfect fit. The only thing that is a little disappointing is when the material is stretched it goes lighter making it almost look like you can see through it. I use this suit for tunel flying. It has held up ok. Minus one of the seams busting l, but that was my own fault."
4.0,I bought this to wear to my sons wedding. It was 104 degrees and this material stood up to that well. It swirled nicely while dancing and the sleeves are a good size. My only issue is I wish there had been a petite. This dress is made for persons 5’5” and up. Or wear platforms like I did.
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Great cut, material & fit. Embroidery style just didn't fit my girl like I thought. Many will consider this a favorite"
4.0,Cute color and comfortable. I'm 5'4 145 lbs. Got xl and it's fits loosly but I like it that way.
4.0,They look nice and the texture is soft for the velvet. The only issue is the velvet ones slip of in his sleep and annoys him. Every day wear is good though.
4.0,"This romper ended up being better than expected! I'm top heavy with longer legs so rompers usually make me look like spongebob, but this one gave me some nice shape while also being a nice thick material. I ordered the olive green in a size small and it was a smidge big but overall A++"
4.0,"This suit is just as cute as in pictures, the only issue I have is the bra cups are a little small but I do have a larger bust."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with how nice this hat feels and looks. I ordered the light pink which was hard to tell color on the website but was a nice color in person. The flower detail is well made but comes separate and after struggling to get it to sit right, ended up placing a few hidden stitches through the ribbon and that was a simple fix. A nice accessory for a spring/summer outfit."
4.0,Great colors but very thin!
4.0,awesome hat its soft and warm and doesn't let the wind through this has become my new favorite winter hat
4.0,These are super soft. Ordered a medium but they're too small. Will have to size up which is frustrating!
4.0,Too small for me but it looks gorgeous on my daughter.
4.0,They are useful as layer pieces.  My only issue is they are cut VERY straight and have no give around the bottom where the lace is.
4.0,This mask is it!!!! It's a good fabric and cute!!! Stretchy but not very breathable for a very long time. I tend to give myself breaks to get fresh air. The material inside is warm so my face starts to sweat a little but overall its great! I also received so many compliments!! Love reppin my country.
4.0,Nice blouse but very thin and see through. I wish it was a tad bit longer.
4.0,Shipped fast. This will be gifted out. I'm sure he will enjoy it
4.0,"This bracelet comes with the nice message of the serenity prayer. It did come undone the first day I wore it, so I had to tighten it and now the leather overhangs. It's a bit overpriced, but still nice enough."
4.0,"I figured this would fit small, thankful I sized up and got a large.  These are super comfortable and easy to wear.  Needed a comfy, cute skirt to wear to work, and this does the trick.  I wash on cold and hang dry too, b/c I don't want them getting any smaller."
4.0,The dress arrived quickly and it fit as I expected it to.
4.0,"The knotted pearl set is lovely. Upon closer inspection they are not 100% blemish free (95% I'd say), but they are gorgeous. I will wear these as often as possible.<br /><br />The clasp is secure and will definitely keep both the bracelet and necklace closed. I do not fear losing them. The posts on the earrings are a bit long, but I'd prefer this to too short. The bracelet might slip off of a very tiny wrist- my wrist is 6 inches, therefore it can not be pulled off while it is clasped.<br /><br />I am so glad that I asked for this set as a gift. They are not large and tacky, but neither are they too tiny or childish.<br /><br />This set can be worn daily but it will also look fantastic for a special occasion. I am not a pearl connoisseur, but I certainly Iove classic pearl jewelry.<br /><br />Feel free to ask me questions about this set."
4.0,"This hat is so cute! I love using it for making videos and using it for cosplays, it’s a comfy fit, and the materials are super nice. :))) I do wish that I could play around with the ears more, but the skeleton inside the ears isn’t super strong and easy to manipulate. Other then that I would say this is 100% a good purchase!"
4.0,the only thing i dont like is the plugs are screw offs and dont have the rubber ring on them
4.0,"I got this because of COVID. Pros: I don’t want the security guards at my workplace going through my bag. I can finally find things easily. Con: It’s ugly (no offense to the manufacturers, as it’s well made). However it’s functional, sturdy and quite large. I appreciate it."
4.0,it a nice shirt but the large size fit as medium...
4.0,"Giving 4 stars because I really loved this necklace. I could only wear it one time because it broke so easily. But hey, you get what you pay for (shrugs)"
4.0,I like this dress!
4.0,Easier to get keys on and off than a normal ring. Feels solid too. I ordered a second set for my parents.
4.0,Cool but it ripped kinda easily but oh well it’s pretty easy to fix so 🤷‍♀️
4.0,It's a little hard to get on and off catches 70 percent of the hair It's pretty thin don't know how long it will last
4.0,"Lightweight, mostly very comfortable.  The only issue is the inside waistline is rough so I have to wear a tshirt tucked in to protect from it.  I wear the xl as swim trunks, and 2xl for around the house."
4.0,I'm 5'1&#34; and a 32A and I purchased a small. This dress fits fairly well on me. The waist was only slightly loose but by tying the ribbon it fits snug. The top part of the dress is a bit loose on me but it would fit even better on someone with a slightly larger bust. The material and stitching looks well made and the quality is good.  I'm giving it a 4/5 because I wish they made it in an xs!
4.0,"Very flattering cut. I would buy it again. I am making alterations to the wrap part of the dress. It needs ties on the inside to secure the dress. All it comes with is one cloth belt, more like a robe tie and it just doesn't feel secure enough. I wish it already dad the inside tie for more security."
4.0,They work nicely but could be a little longer around the neck!
4.0,"Cute winter, spring or fall!"
4.0,"I bought 3 shorts and 3 shirts. The shorts fit perfectly and look great, however the shirt is WAY too big. I wear large in nearly every other piece of clothing. This shirt is like a dress. Hopefully it shrinks in the wash. Other than that I'm very happy with the company."
4.0,Looks very cute on.
4.0,Just a lil bit loose from the bottle
4.0,Order a size ahead and you are ready to GO
4.0,Dainty.  Nice shape.  I would prefer a larger earring.  I wish the site had an easy way to tell how large the jewelry is.  Perhaps a photograph next to a quarter or a ruler?
4.0,These are the cutest hoops you’ll come across not to mention for the price!!
4.0,It looks flashy and it is comfortable although the material quality is not as good as expected.
4.0,My wife ordered these. Her report is that this underwear is  good quality material and elasticity.
4.0,Nice material and good quality
4.0,I like it a lot. Looks just as pictures show it.
4.0,Be sure to wash before wearing.  It is much softer after a trip through the washing machine.  I don't like sleeping clothes that are too tight and this is wonderfully loose and a good length.
4.0,Birthday gift for my husband he loves them
4.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful.  Well made. Lightweight but not too sheer.  I only wish it was a little longer to the top of my knee. I was hoping to wear this as a dress to a beach wedding. It hits me a little higher than mid thigh and covers all of my bodily insecurities. That's the magic....
4.0,Nice bag for that price.. but the handles are very stiff...that is the only thing I didn't like with it. Otherwise it is good
4.0,"Very good, they don't come off."
4.0,It’s a cute necklace for a young teen. The chain is very light weight.
4.0,"After 1 day, the cushioning sole is flattened, Other than that, they're comfy."
4.0,"Great, not for big waist though"
4.0,Nice looking shoes for all occasion. So far so good.
4.0,Very well made and they have a nice feel to them. They were to long for me. They came down below my knees so I had them altered. All instructions are written in Chinese .
4.0,"I have been running for a handful of years and only started running barefoot a month or so ago when my shoes became a nuisance in the middle of the Malibu Marathon and I was forced to toss my shoes and go natural. I ended up running about 6.5 miles bare and noticed that it was not only easier, but my body felt more aligned, and I ran faster.<br /><br />I started to dabble into barefoot running and came to the conclusion that while I am training to run bare, I needed something to protect my feet from sharp objects (e.g. glass) and to help strengthen my feet.<br /><br />I was suggested Sockwa my numerous people and ordered them.<br /><br />When I first put them on, I knew these things were my missing link.<br /><br />Running in them feel as bare as you can get and in no way hinder any natural movements or expansions of the feet.<br /><br />I strongly recommend."
4.0,"The cap portion and the front side cover appears to be thick and strong, for kids to handle"
4.0,Great just what I was looking for to replace my ps4 thumbsticks
4.0,My fiancé loves these earrings. Have that unique rose gold/ black hills gold look. Even though they are plated they must have done a good because after a few months my fiancées ears are doing well when another manufacturers plating didn't hold up over the same period and were irritating her ears.
4.0,"Works great and has a long battery life, but I added a second battery so I wouldn't have be cold on those long days outside.  I only wish that there were some warmers located in the back of the vest.  Only the front warms up."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7e9ac72fdacbbfcb8849a67fe0c7094f]] Fits well, nice for tanning"
4.0,They fit however I am concerned they may need help to stay up in the long term
4.0,"A little thin as far as the material goes, but for the price it's a great fit and not a bad looking jean either. I use them for work jeans."
4.0,Look cheap but surprisingly still love them
4.0,"The color is good, the fabric is comfortable, the size is the right size."
4.0,"Well made, goes well with any of the Alex and Ani bracelets"
4.0,"These gloves are thin and stretchy. They worked well for my 5th-grade music program. They did not react under black light, but I used laundry detergent to get some reactivity. (All Free and Clear and I didn't rinse them thoroughly) I hung them to dry in fear they would shrink. I also had my students use reactive black light tape on them to decorate. They turned out great."
4.0,"This hat is unisex but fits me better than it fit my husband. So I have a new hat, lol, It keeps your ears and neck warm. I haven't used the face mask yet so don't know if it works."
4.0,Bought the blue one & I loved it so I ended up buying the green suit & love that one too :) these look good on me I would say 5'4 110lbs<br />i& i ordered both size small :)
4.0,If you're looking for a short/mini dress this is it.
4.0,Nice looking product and comfortable. The only thing I have is that you can get a similar product that holds up just as well for less at Walmart.
4.0,"Although I wore latex gloves to wash dishes or clean the house, my decent water-resistant watch couldn't handle the moisture.  It seemed a waste to buy another $100+ watch.  Casio's watch has risen in price with inflation, but it's a more practical everyday watch for my active lifestyle- - - sports, housework, gardening, etc.  The watch is utilitarian black, with adjustable strap which fit my small wrist. I needed a Youtube video to tell me how to turn off the alarm, which is preset to sound at midnight.  Apart from that, I was able to figure out how to set the watch from the tiny, mainly pictorial manual.  I recommend the watch."
4.0,run small so buy larger other then that fit good
4.0,"I got this from my son just because. It was very sweet, they locket is pretty nice, I only dropped a star because it doesn't always clasp shut well."
4.0,"I love my rings but they are starting to change color, from silver to black. Some of the stones look like they aren't there anymore, even though they are."
4.0,"The color and look of the dress on my 9 yo daughter is gorgeous, but it did not go all the way to the floor like I expected. It could just be because she is at the age where she is skinny and getting taller. Otherwise, the dress is perfect for her school pageant."
4.0,My Daughter Love
4.0,"The fabric and details on the sweater are first rate - great style and perfect for a dress topper. I ordered 3 different colors for the price of one I might find at Macy or a mall store. I usually wear a 10 or 12 top and am a C cup, so I ordered L. I think it is a smallish Large, so exchanged for XL. The L would have been fine as long as I wanted it unbuttoned, like a shrug - or just a snug fit."
4.0,Its very expensive looking every one seems to like it wen my sister has it on
4.0,Great transition for kiddos that are used to a nose piece.
4.0,Nice hat for the price! Daughter loves it!
4.0,"Love this dress. I am 4'10 and weigh 112 pounds. I ordered an xs and a small. I had to stick with a small. Also this dress is made to fit taller people, so I had to get my dress altered. After alterations, it fit like a glove. Wore to an island theme wedding and I received many compliments."
4.0,"Yes! They were a tad too long even with my 4 inch heels. I'm 5'2 . I had to get them hemned up but other than that they are so perfect. The material, the fit, I love!"
4.0,"It's cute, but the material isn't the best."
4.0,I got this dress in a medium and I'm 5'4&#34; 134. I like the dress but the are holes do run large.
4.0,"These are adorable and fun. They do come a little small so they may not fit everyone how the picture shows but still very cute. I like the style of them very much but the metal seems to not be very strong. The colors of the silver and the teal/turquoise gems are a great combination. The thing I have to complain most about is that one of the rings came broken, which is sad because it is one of the cutest ones in the set. Other than the broken ring and wishing it was a stronger metal I am happy with the ring set."
4.0,"Very cute pin, but it is not blue as pictured. It is white & rose gold."
4.0,"This was snug on my 7 year old daughter, so the claimed size range of age 3-12 is a bit exaggerated. The material is cool and breathable, and the designs are a big hit with my kiddos. However, the filter pouch is also hard to line up sometimes as the smooth fabric slides around a lot. I haven't found filter inserts that really work in the small pouch, but one of the main reasons to use a gaiter is because you can keep it on your neck and never need to worry about forgetting a mask. This is much harder to do with a filter tucked into the pouch."
4.0,Looks great.  Has held up.  Good quality.
4.0,"- Colour is not same as in picture, it's cold white, that makes item less Vintage<br />- Ribbon Material quality could be better<br />anyway nice to have it :)"
4.0,Fit is perfect.  Style is not as mature as of like
4.0,"Great shirt, no shrinkage after washing (not that it was expected). Light weight and comfortable."
4.0,Beautiful dress but the lace was snagged/ripped in some areas so I returned it.
4.0,"The product was shipped on time. But when i received my package there were a few of the glass crystal balls were broken, other than that I love the product"
4.0,It is made in China but hasn't fallen apart so far
4.0,"I am 5'11, 160. I wear a M in just about everything. I bought a large, and it was way too short. I had my mom cut it off and make it a shirt. I get a TON of compliments on it. The ruffles are not as bouncy...definitely lay much flatter. Though, I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,I purchased these to use as slippers when previous attempts with clogs would not stay on my feet.
4.0,The pants seem a little big.
4.0,This dress was exactly what I wanted but alas I'm too big and couldn't get the zipper even kinda closed. I'm a size 14/16 in most dresses for reference
4.0,Thought these would be high waist with looking at the pic but non the less the fit and color is cute
4.0,"Very nice, but watch out for the static!"
4.0,Reasonable price and good product!!!
4.0,Cute dress but a little longer than I expected.
4.0,"For the price this is an awesome buy.  The material is kind of weird, it feels like similar dresses you'd get at Ross etc. it's pretty short but I usually wear leggings underneath dresses like that."
4.0,Beautiful colored bracelet!  Perfect compliment accessory for Summer!
4.0,Love the bag! The divided smaller compartment with the strap to attach keys makes it easy to find keys. The material on the outside of the bag is very durable. Great commuter bag that carried everything I need including my kindle.
4.0,"I like the top , haven’t worn it since weather is too hot. Haven’t washed it either. Will come<br />Back with updates in fall"
4.0,I got a 2XL it was too big for me. Plus we didn’t need this color after all. The fit was cute just not for me...
4.0,I love my outfit!
4.0,"I've only had the shirt for 5 days now, but I've worn it every day, all day, and quickly formed an opinion.  It clearly prevents me from slouching, mainly by tugging very gently whenever my shoulders shift forward, an action that is almost imperceptible.  On the downside, I can feel the shirt compressing around my chest as I move around, which is slightly annoying.  I typically wear very loose T-shirts so I suspect that I'll eventually get used to this new feeling.  Then there is the matter of zippers and chest hair, which requires no further elaboration."
4.0,"Really beautiful looking romper the color almost looks like a dark blue black instead of navy. But still beautiful. The romper fits well and is nicely made and looks as if it’s an expensive item of clothing. Their shorts so could you some work in redesign. The waistband is poorly made in the last week seems to tumble around itself making a wave pattern instead of just sticking and staying straight. That makes the shorts go up to words the waist from the hip from behind it. Since the tour is really short, you can see this if you raise your hands.  All in all still a really good buy. Fits as expected. I’m 140, medium fit well."
4.0,"I have gotten so many compliments, and it is super comfortable!"
4.0,"very soft, comfortable, well fitting. I am 5'2, 120lbs pear shaped for the moment!<br />The large shorts fit well, and the medium capris also fit well.  Hold you in so I feel there is support in all the right places. The waist band is just at the naval and wide so it doesn't pinch.<br />One pair of Heather capris had a small pull in waist band , but doesn't seem to effect integrity- yet.<br />Colors are beautiful, and the key/ phone pocket is a nice addition."
4.0,Love this dress!  Fits perfectly and very classy. The only thing that could be a problem is that the material is thinner than I thought so might have to wear spanks. I do love that the design of the dress draws yours eyes away from the tummy and creates a flattering curvy figure.
4.0,The product arrived on time and it fits great.
4.0,"Very nice.  I got the Loop and Fringe infinity style.  Cute and soft.  It's a nice size, fluffy but not too big and overwhelming.  Fits a &#34;boho chic&#34; style.  Bought for a friend as a gift but will order one for myself also.  I would rate as 5 stars but I feel it's slightly expensive for what it is.  Although cute, you can tell it's not super high quality.  I would expect something like this to cost around 10-12 dollars.  However, i would repurchase as I feel it's unique."
4.0,Fit is good. My daughter loves these for tumbling class instead of the mask. However she did not like the design of the flag one. It says 4 July on the front side. We were hoping for just American flag print.
4.0,"The dress arrived a little wrinkled and ironing the pleats was a bit of a challenge. I’m 5’6”, 135 lbs, and I got the medium. I’ve ordered other vintage style dresses and they usually fit pretty perfectly, but this one is a little big around the bust and shoulders. I think sizing down would have been too small in the waist for me. It’s not a terrible fit but a definitely a slight odd cut as “off the rack” sizes usually fit me perfectly."
4.0,"I would have given 5 stars but the shoes were too small.  Make sure to buy up at least one size maybe 2.  Other than that they are awesome!  Lights are bright, easy to use."
4.0,comfertable
4.0,I bought this for my boyfriend he loved it unfortunately it didn’t work though . But it’s a very nice watch for the most part
4.0,"It won't remember the time or the message you make it say when you shut it off and the app doesn't remember the text you input either. It defaults to ""Cool Carnival"" which is not cool at all. Bluetooth connection is really sketchy, but it gets 4 stars for the coolness factor."
4.0,Nice but kept rising up my thighs
4.0,"They look and feel high quality despite the low price, and is great for cosplay. I say give it a purchase"
4.0,"My first impression was that these were baby soft. I love the feel. My second thought is that these are way too small. It was a struggle to get them on, reminded me more of tights than leggings, but once they were on, they fit comfortably and I have no doubt that I will buy more from the company. The only reason I am rating it a 4 is because it arrived later than expected and I wish getting them on was easier."
4.0,"This shirt was a gift. Recipient said it fit fine. I thought the color was good, fabric was sewn properly, shirt was lightweight but not exactly see-through. I would match bra with fabric color for modesty. Arrived on time, in a plastic bag and wrinkly, but wrinkles should come out if hung up immediately after first washing."
4.0,"I love this robe, is very soft and cozy and the price is great. Also fit me very well."
4.0,"So far, we've found the Moosberry brand to have cute and well made dresses.  I like that they are a classic style and 100% cotton.  This style washed and dried well in the machine and was not too wrinkled.  We have this in the size 6 for my almost 6 year old daughter.  She is about 44"" tall and 40lbs.  She is thin and this is definitely baggy on her.  I found the style to be too Little House on the Prairie.  The loose fit and the neck ruffle really add to this.  I think, with accessories, it may work.  Other than the particular style preference, I have no complaints.  "
4.0,"These are good for the most part! I really like the material, I like that it’s easy to clean and keep that way. The one drawback - that makes it really tough - is that they are hard to get on and off the watch itself. Even pushing the release still makes it really tight, and it’s like that with all of the colors."
4.0,Very cute and comfortable dress. Im 5’1 and ordered the medium...it’s a perfect length.
4.0,This dress is beautiful. The only thing I didn't like was the top it's see through. My daughter usually wears a size 13 make sure you  measure before buying we end up getting a size 16 and it fits her perfectly.
4.0,No me<br />Gustan las foto
4.0,"Love the size of the bill. It does cover my whole face. Just wish it was a slide on instead of a back closure,  but that's just my preference.  It is will serve my beach life"
4.0,Really good fit and comfortable
4.0,"Nice strong magnets, clear CZ"
4.0,I’m 6’2 and 280 lbs so I ordered the 3xl ans it was to big. I never got to wear it.
4.0,The movie will never compare to what it is like wearing something that not every woman in the room is wearing.  Thank you so much for the eagerness to please the customer.  I love them.
4.0,"Very poorly made, size runs extremely small"
4.0,Love the soft silkiness of these. Very comfy yet nice looking. Good fit and good for summer weather. Will try a long version this fall/winter!
4.0,"I wear a size 12 jean. According to the size chart my measurements put me in between 14 and 16. so I got the 16. Probably should've gotten the 14 instead.<br />Lined, thick, quality material and stitching. Full-ish coverage in the rear"
4.0,"For the size of this bag, it's a good price and it came on time. I also like the size of it"
4.0,"I like the material and look...If you want a loose fit, go 1 size up."
4.0,"I got this when Amazon price was lowest. Now it costs more than what I paid.  Very beautiful design. I am enjoying the watch every day.  It looks much better than what they show on website.  It is some what heavy watch, some may not like.  It is perfect watch.  When I opened the box first time it had little scratches."
4.0,Nice but they run small to tight.
4.0,"Great casual design and fit. A size 9 fit nicely, not to tight or to loose."
4.0,These are a little on the short side. I am 5'4&#34;. They only go from the knee to top of the ankle. I like mine to go over the ankle and cover the top of the shoe a little.  They have a nice stretch though so are very comfortable.
4.0,Silver my favorite color. Love the shape and design of the earrings.
4.0,It’s nice after getting used to
4.0,Very nice. Just its all bent and I dont know how to make it firm.
4.0,"This top is super comfortable and light weight. Wore it out for goth night and got so many compliments!<br /><br />Pros: looks great no matter body size, I layered a black tank under because I wasn't comfortable showing skin. Super light so it won't have you sweating profusely. Also, great price!<br /><br />Cons: the strings constantly come undone on the hands and the fabric of my shirt basically had two right thumbs. The left hand fits awkward but you can't really tell by looking at it."
4.0,"I'm 5'8&#34; so I have long arms, because of this I decided to get a large. It fit really well and looks great. I liked that the fabric was soft and smooth, like a mixture of cotton and spandex :) definitely gonna buy more of these."
4.0,"This was not the wallet I wanted to purchase. The card slots are very tight but I am sure they will stretch. It has great space. The only thing I do not like is the cheap made leather. When I first opened the package, the ink was on my hands. After wiping off with a warm cloth, it was ok."
4.0,"It took some gentle bending to make it fit my ear, but overall, I like it. I haven't worn it much, I'm a little afraid it will fall off. Be careful bending it, its cheap metal and will break easily. Definitely worth the price."
4.0,"Wish I would have found plastic bars a long time ago for my labre peircing before my teeth got worn down. Very comfortable and easy to put on, but the gems keep falling out and one broke in half, still great value for the money."
4.0,"Beautiful.  Looks great on a fit man. Very very small. I buy my husband med to large t's, because I like the tighter fit. This was an xxl (I think), and fit perfectly."
4.0,Caps were okay and the shield on each was little too much for me. Just got to get use to it.but over all I like them.Pretty cool.
4.0,"I love these pants. Before I looked in the mirror I thought “I can feel a breeze!” The material felt a bit heavy out of the packaging, so this assuaged my worries.<br /><br />The good:  They’re very comfy. The dark gray is gorgeous. And I love the pleats on the side, it looks really funky.<br /><br />The meh:  I’m not crazy about elastic waistbands, but I can’t imagine what other type you’d have for this sort of garment. I was a bit puzzled by only one “cord” on the inside of the pant leg to adjust the height, but I tied it on itself and all was well. Do not buy this if you’re looking for a slimming  pant; that it is not. But they look fabulous nonetheless.<br /><br />I’m so excited I’ve found Mordenmiss and will be buying more lives as my budget allows!"
4.0,The necklace is very pretty.. it arrived when expected. The only criticism I have is the packaging. The chain was in a tangled knot that took me a while to untangle. But I still love the necklace. It just needs to be packed for shipping in a different way.
4.0,"The pendant seems to want to turn around, probably can be fixed with another link added to it, just need to find the time to do it as to why I only gave it 4 stars."
4.0,I do love how this dress looks though.  It was just a bit snugged but nothing a spanx can fix...
4.0,"This necklace definitely brings the bling.  When first out of the package I thought the clasp was broken.  It took a lot of force to get the male portion into the clasp.  One I got it snapped in place I thought for sure it would never get it to release again but after pulling really hard and repeatedly snapping and releasing it finally started going in and out in one smooth motion.  Brand new, to much overlay, so a quality control issue for sure.  I also found that the necklace will only lay properly with the CZ's out if attached one way.  Again I thought it was defective.  I just couldn't get it to lay with the bling side out until I turned it around and attached it.  So after all of that I'm still giving it four stars because it really is a pretty, believable looking diamond/CZ necklace.  Since the stones are only 3mm they give you shine and sparkle without being gaudy and the overlay is very well done."
4.0,"Most of the reviews on ski pants, say they run small so I ordered one size larger than I wear, and they were still too tight for comfort."
4.0,"The is dress is amazing, but in order to get it long enough, it swallowed both my girls around the bodice.  I tried to have it taken in, but due to the way it is put together (which it is really well made), it made it not easy to alter.  In the end, we left it big and made it work.  They looked beautiful for what we needed.  However, if you have a small frame kiddo as I do, this might not be a good match, especially if you need it to be tailored."
4.0,"These are awesome, but with one flaw. After wearing them for an extended amount of time, my ears start to itch. Other than that, they're smaller than I expected (which isn't a bad thing) and have about as much detail as you'd expect from Amazon."
4.0,"very cute, we are using them at a wedding reception, want to be comfortable and out of heels"
4.0,"Pretty good Carolina blue color...soft feel, warm."
4.0,Slightly bigger than expected but good quality item.
4.0,Size overall was accurate - but was a little short for my sons torso. Still good t shirts.
4.0,"Pretty good! Good quality, it’s got a slip underneath and so it’s a little heavy. Even with the slip it’s still a little see through though (I got white). I’m 5’8” and usually wear a small in things but dresses are always too short. I bought the medium and the small to see which was better and I ended up going with the medium just for the length. Overall though a super cute dress!"
4.0,"This dress is okay, but isn't a favorite.  I only took off one star because it is described well by the seller.and my criticism is more personal taste.<br />It is made well with a tiered skirt and a drawstring waist. It looks nice.  I would like it more if it was rayon rather than polyester.  I ordered the blue and it looks like the photos, but I wish it had more blue and less peach.  The colors give it a kind of country look that is not my style.  The length is a few inches above my ankles.  I think I will like it better shortened further."
4.0,These earrings are very small.  They are for a young girl but I had to put my glasses on to see them
4.0,"Very cute and sexy, fits true to size."
4.0,The chains a little small for me but its still really pretty
4.0,"Love these shirts and have bought 3, but know that sometimes the colors are not too much what it shows, the colors are just off like I ordered purple and it is more lavendar.  But shirts are great!"
4.0,Slimming because the lines are vertical
4.0,"Fit & size seem accurate, but it seems more sheer than the photo."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for a co-worker who is very ""girly"" and loves pink.  It was very pretty but looks more like something a young girl would wear.  Don't suggest you buy it for an adult."
4.0,Love it need to buy more like this in different colors.
4.0,"My daughter got this bag for Xmas, she loves it. Its durable & has lots of room. Great colors to choose from."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:8a40a74e98694ced073bfc8b0b8a3e06]] Hermosa diadema con piedras decorativas, tiene una apariencia de que está hecha a mano y se ve delicada, me encantó. La tela se siente suave y es una diadema super cómoda y queda muy hermosa."
4.0,These are great workout shirts. One is smaller in the sleeves than the other one. Not too big of a deal. I can always push the sleeves up if I need to.
4.0,"Nice tie, unfortunately it did not match the color of my dress"
4.0,Cute design and fits great though the back is a little smooth.
4.0,"I loved this dress, but it ran super small.  I ordered a XXL and it didn't even fit over my chest.  It was a gorgeous dress and I'm so disappointed."
4.0,I’ve bought other colors but this one is kind of scratchy. More of a crinkley fabric. But pretty.
4.0,"They are fun and they are cheap. AND...they are polarized! I expect that if I rough-house them that they will scratch or chip. So, I'll treat them gently and get my money's worth. Then I'll order more!"
4.0,Good simple shorts. Fits great comfortable
4.0,The glasses are very cute and come with a car case.  My grandson loves them!
4.0,I needed something to help me fly then walk around Disneyland until midnight.  Worked great up to a point but the top was so tight that it left a painful dent at the end of the day.  I would wear them again but not for 16 hours mostly on my feet.  8-10 would be fine.
4.0,"These are perfect for my little granddaughter to wear under her dresses. They are on the thin side, or I would have given 5 stars. She absolutely loves them!"
4.0,Very comfortable and a great weight. Got these for my father who has difficulty with joggers being too tight around his calf. Not a problem with the zipper being on the ankle
4.0,"I am baffled by the awesome quality of this dress for the price!!  Bought it for an upcoming party, and love that it's thick enough to wear alone but not so thick that it will be hot.  Only issue is...I'm just under 5'10&#34; and this is a SHIRT!  Haha.  Tried it on and I am now on the hunt for cute shorts or leggings to wear under it.  Definitely won't fly for a dress if you're tall at all!  I'm sure the measurements may have shown that, but thought I would let people know my experience.  ;)"
4.0,Shipped quick and fits right! Great necklace!
4.0,It wasn't as big(wide) as i thought... But it works. Got the all black one. Pretty cool.
4.0,"This watch is beautiful, a stunning piece of jewelry in a watch.  I say &#34;piece of jewelry in a watch&#34; because it is very difficult to see the hands on the crystal background to get the time.  There are no numbers or tick marks or anything on the face or the round frame to help indicate the time.  And if there were, I believe it would take away from the look of this watch and it would appear too busy.  So in summary, it is a beautiful and unique looking watch, but difficult to see the time."
4.0,Loved the shirt but it smelled like vinegar when I received it
4.0,I love this dress! I'm 5'6&#34; and 185. I ordered an XL. The dress fits perfectly. It's lightweight without being see-through. It's very soft and flowy. The only thing making it four stars for me is the stripe pattern can be seen through the seams by the shoulders. I'll be ordering another one in a different color.
4.0,Ran a bit bigger than true size. Not bad just unexpected.
4.0,Pretty lightweight material.  Comfortable.  For other buyers' purposes:  I weigh around 165 and ordered an XL.  Hourglass figure.<br />I'm 5'4&#34;.
4.0,The only downfall is you can see your underwear through them so wear a long tank top. Other than that they are wonderful. Going to order another pair!
4.0,"Él pantalon es y se ve de muy buena calidad pero él diseño no es como yo lo esperaba quizás a alguien con un poco mas de peso le quede mejor yo mido 6 pies y peso 167 libras, él ajuste en las piernas es bastante bueno pero arriba a nivel de cintura no me gusto él diseño, como digo al principio es de muy buena calidad él pantalón.."
4.0,whim doozie of a T.
4.0,Nice.  Zipper sticks a little.
4.0,"I asked my husband how he would rate them and he said a four.  That tells me that he is saying they are not perfect but they meet his needs.  He wore them the whole time we were in Gulf Shores, Alabama so they must work.  I think his only complaint is that unless the sun is bright, the sunglasses are too dark for him.  (I like really dark!)"
4.0,I like that I sweat less in this top. I don't like to sweat.
4.0,Shirt is a super cute style but shoulder cut doesn’t fall right and feels too snug.
4.0,"I am in between a small and medium but took a medium because i want to be comfy and sleep in the bra as well. It is very silky , the straps are not adjustable and are a little loose but pulling the bra down and that tightens them some. Very cute and I love it. It doesn't stretch much and the pads are a little thick so sweating is gonna happen im sure lol. I am happy with this bra for real! Ordering another in a different color"
4.0,"very cool watch. I have the rose gold color why not get the blue one. I am wearing it as I speak it's nice, very nice Casio imitation."
4.0,Love the way it fits only wish straps would stay hooked left side constantly coming unhooked from the back
4.0,I like these dresses. I own 2 of them.
4.0,"They're great, exactly as described, but the color's slightly different than any of my other sterling silver jewelry. These earrings are a cooler gray, and definitely can't be paired with older jewelry that tends to have warmer tones. But still a cute piece."
4.0,I bought this dress for my teenaged daughter. She LOVES it. The material is kinda cheap but she grows quickly so it'll do.
4.0,Not as thick as I expected but it lays nicely
4.0,Cus of material it wears down a little faster but inprefer this cotton fleece . Iys super comfy
4.0,They need to be a little wider to hold a little more
4.0,good shape and design
4.0,"I know it reflects light well, but I can only assume drivers see me at night with this jacket on. It's a comfortable jacket with two pockets on the inside and two on the outside. Good for wearing in the rain. I recommend this jacket."
4.0,"I selected these for travel to use specifically as shower shoes.<br /><br />These showers shoes are a single piece, no seams...to worry about. The soles are slightly firm, like memory foam, and raised -- to keep your feet out of the water that often accumulates in the shower.<br /><br />Highly Recommended !!!"
4.0,2 pack. Worked as it should.
4.0,These are a little stiffer than I would have expected for a pair of infant shoes but they're ok.
4.0,"This bag is really, really big! I'm short and this thing is about half of my size. I like how this bag is made as well. It's super sturdy and perfect for traveling (like flying or a bus ride) or a trip to the beach to hold all your stuff. The color is great and isn't too outlandish. Overall, I think it's a great heavy duty bag, I do wish it had pockets on the inside but that's why it includes a small pouch.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion."
4.0,If you have big head forget it it won’t fit and not a jot of give<br />If you have med to small head this will work and is great rim color scheme is great
4.0,"Not too big, doesn't expand much but for the price it serves it's purpose well."
4.0,Works well.  Don't know how long it will last.
4.0,Great purse. The only way it could be improved is if the adjustable strap were about two inches longer for cross body wear - but otherwise great!
4.0,I am 6' 175lbs and a medium fits pretty well. I use it mainly to workout and it does get a bit saggy when I sweat a lot but overall a good tank top.
4.0,"I like it, it is super pretty and looks like the picture but it is sort of weird material its not cotton like normal shirts but I still love it."
4.0,Replace for  large zize
4.0,the earrings were perfect! absolutely loved them! they look so adorable on my toddler!
4.0,"Super darling! I recently had a baby, so I’ve got that post pregnancy tummy and horrid stretch marks, and I love that the cinched sides hide all that! The shorts underneath the skirt are a nice touch, too! Be sure to purchase the next size up, though, like other reviewers recommend. I’m grateful that I did, otherwise it would’ve been too small. I’m 5’8” and usually wear size 10/12 or large, and I ordered an XL."
4.0,"Beautiful print, lots of compliments!"
4.0,Like the size and good value
4.0,Nice piece. Great price. Put it on a hemp necklace instead of chain. Looks great.
4.0,"My top fit perfectly. The bottoms fit around my butt and on my stomach but it was a little baggy around the vagina area. I am normally a 10-12 so I got the XXL but I will be returning and going one to two sizes down. Regardless of the sizing issue, the product is good quality. No hanging threads or cheap material. It was exactly as the picture depicted it."
4.0,"So, My gigantic head measures to exactly 24"", which is the stated max (7 5/8-3/4 hat size). I had low expectations, due to previous failures, but low and behold, the thing actually fits! If you had a 22"" melon, you'd be swimming comically in it.<br />Quality control is a bit lacking though. The crown of the hat is not quite  aligned with the center of the brim, and the snaps to Aussie cowboy style it are not aligned with where the snaps on the crown are. It was inexpensive, and neither of those is a deal breaker for me, so I only knocked it down 1 star.<br />Beyond that, it's actually pretty well made. stitching is good, and it's well ventilated. It even has a secondary mesh liner to keep your noggin sweat from staining the outer nylon of the crown."
4.0,Adorable key chains. A little bit on the thinner side but overall quality if fine. Had the key chains for about 2 months now. The color hasn't tarnished or changed.
4.0,"Areke Mens Wood Bracelets Fashion Unisex Link Wrist Tibetan Buddhist Buddha Beads Prayer Mala Amulet Color Black<br />I ordered several different bracelets from this company and generally I like them. They fit my wrist nicely.  They do have kind of a funky aroma though so you might want to air them out before you wear them or give them as a gift.<br />The problem I have with the one with the “Chinese coin” is that the coin is VERY thin. I am afraid that if you wore this bracelet on a regular basis it would get bent, and fast.  I am also not convinced of the quality of the elastic, but I don’t plan on showering with it or getting it wet, so no worries.<br />On the one with the wood block, I wish I knew what the Chinese symbols on the wood block said or meant. Not that they are easy to read, but I don’t really want to be walking around with “dumb elephant lady” on my wrist. Know what I mean?<br />I also don’t know what the symbol on the other side of the block is. It kind of looks like fancy shoe laces or something. Oh well.<br />As a fashion piece, this is a winner.<br />I received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I am always honest because otherwise it would be a waste of my time to write them and your time to read them. Please help me by “liking” my review below. Thanks"
4.0,Only used it once on a trip to Chicago but held up nicely with walking from the L to the hotel and no issues with carry on size.
4.0,"Love it but it is tight in my upper arms and chest area, I typically wear and 8-10 and this would have needed to be a 12 to fit without being tight"
4.0,"This sock has everything and more that one would want in a sock: plush, snug and keeps feet warm (in the winter) but never sweaty (nice ventilation). The only downside is when I am wearing it around the house they do twist a little which can be annoying. But overall great sock. Much better than I expected."
4.0,"The first thing you need to know about these wings, is that they are made of foam. You know the thin foam sometimes is used to wrap packaging? That kind, not fabric. So that was very surprising to find when I first opened the box. That being said, they are still pretty epic. There was a little blurp on the packaging that says you can use a blow dryer to reshape them. I did try that, which seemed to help a little but not to the extent of getting out all of the creases from them being shipped. Also they are a little flat, wished they had a little stuffing inside the layers to poof them out a bit. Also the tails rotate inward a bit so from the front you don't get the full length.  My pictures are blocked on here so sorry for the lack of. They photographed well and overall was happy with them but for the material the price should have been lower in my opinion."
4.0,"So, the great thing about it is it came as pictured and reading the reviews helped me decide on what size would be best. It's definitely got a quality feel especially for the price. It doesn't come with instructions on how to get the straps around the legs set up but thankfully someone else had posted a how to video, which was helpful. The only other issue I have is with the necklace that came with it. The chain is too long but I was able to find another seller who sells a replica necklace with a shorter chain for a decent price. If only the necklace weren't so long and it had instructions on how to set up the straps I'd give this 5 stars."
4.0,"I was given the locket that will hold these charms as a birthday gift and wanted to buy a few more charms for variety.  These charms are very tiny, very sweet, and I do love them.  But they are seriously over priced, and I'm not sure how to open the locket to switch out the charms."
4.0,I had seen this keychain at the Cass Scenic Railroad gift shop while visiting WV last month.  My granddaughter wanted it as a memory of our great weekend trip. There were two keychains on display and we decided that we liked this one best.  I didn't have time to purchase it as we were boarding the train and I forgot to get it when the train ride was over.  So.....I was delighted to find it at Amazon!  It arrived in less than a week.  The colors are nice and I like the description on the back.
4.0,"Size: M (5'2"", 155lbs, 36DD) The top fit well, but the shorts are a little snug; if I sized up to large for a better fit with the shorts, the top will be too big.<br /><br />Material is nice and soft. Colours are nice and vibrant.<br /><br />I would definitely buy again in spite of the fit with the shorts; if the seller allowed separate sizing options for top and shorts, I would rate this 5 instead of 4."
4.0,"I really like these and I want to hate the cheapy earring backs that are clear rubber things, but they really stay on and dont hurt me while I sleep so I can't really hate them, but the backs do look funky..."
4.0,"I love these gloves for looks, comfort, and quality. They are warm in a heated car though not for frigid extended snow removal time with below zero temperatures. I love these gloves and have bought more than one plaid pair. My only wish is that the touch tip were larger. Using a particular angle helps, but I must practice for success or experiment to find a remedy in adding a bit larger touch tip. I would not hesitate to buy more gloves from this company, and I am thankful they make them."
4.0,They are really nicely made.
4.0,Very cute but really big for newborn/infant. They will probably fit when she’s like 3-4 mths
4.0,Love it! Looks very nice.
4.0,This is such a great concept however the beannie does fit big.
4.0,"I ordered this in purple pretty much for a one time use on Domestic Violence Awareness Month's wear purple today. It's a good basic item, warm and soft. It's good quality for the price. I took a star off because while I expected it to run large (women--definitely size down one size for a roomy fit, and more for something more snug), it also is a little too roomy under the armpits (regardless of size)."
4.0,"I sent them as a gift to my Sister Ramona!  It was a sweet surprise, they arrived today!"
4.0,"Very comfortable material. Wash well too. I don't like to see underwear lines and these underwear lines don't show. Breathable too. I've been a fan of Hanes products for a long time and after buying these, not only will I buy more but I'll continue supporting Hanes."
4.0,These earrings are a little larger than I usually wear but they are very nice.  They tend to be heavy so I wear them for shorter periods.
4.0,"Bought this dress in a size 4 which is my regular size but I used the size chart just in case and I was a size 4. Dress fits perfectly, in the photo I'm holding it because I wasn't going to put all that lace which is a down side, a zipper would have been better. Another thing I didn't like is the sash because it looks cheap but that's easy to alter. I'm 5'4 and wearing a 4in. heel and I don't think I have to alter the length, so it's a little bit shorter that I would like because some of my bridesmaids are taller than me. Regardless the quality, I bought this same dress on Amazon but from a different seller and let me tell you this was so much better."
4.0,Great work out Capri but not really comfortable for lounge wear.
4.0,"Arrived on time. Band is a little stiff but is acceptable .  Color was true.  My only complaint was I struggled to secure one strap and in the process I pushed in the one button too far, so I am not able to set time"
4.0,Looks great and is comfortable
4.0,Beautiful dress. Waist is very small. The rest of the dress is loose and flowing.
4.0,Nice price for endless locking hoops.  I wear them all the time.
4.0,"A little more floppy than I anticipated, but it works well."
4.0,"Very soft, good quality.  Just a little large, but that's ok."
4.0,I love this shirt but if you're a busty gal then get a size up. I wear a large most of the time and I am a 38d. So follow their size chart as described. You can tell around the bust that going a size up is the right decision.
4.0,nice hat.
4.0,"beautiful!!!  comfy, washable, easy to breath through.  it's great on it's on just because it''s so pretty.<br />November is national epilepsy month and their symbol is butterfly or lavender flowers.  their color is purple."
4.0,These seem to help with both eczema and varicose veins.
4.0,"Worked great, but definitely not a fashionable addition to my glasses."
4.0,"I first ordered this wedge in my usual size 8, but turned out to be short. So I'd say it runs a little small, but a half a size up will fix the issue. That's what I did, I bought the wedge in 8.5 from a different store because they didn't have it here on Amazon the size and the color I needed for a while. So, this wedge sandal is super comfortable. It doesn't need to be broken in, it already hugs the foot like a glove. The leather is super soft and a good quality for the price. It has the look I was hoping for: a feminine, non - pretentious, easy to style wedge that can go from jeans and shorts to dresses and skirts with giving a little lift to the whole look without compromising the comfort and the long walks with a baby in a stroller. :) I first ordered the neutral color. It looks nice and elongates the legs. I had to return it for a 1/2 size up and so I decided to go with the dark brown. It is a nice dark chocolate brown, neutral and elegant. Also, I like that it has a wooden heel so it gives a little more to the look and the style so it doesn't look cheap. :)<br />I gave 4 stars only because I wasn't expecting that I will need to go 1/2 size up in Steve Madden Shoes wich I never do in this brand."
4.0,Nice quality and color. Like it very much.
4.0,Pretty fun scarf.  Got it as a gift for a friend who is a &#34;birder&#34;.
4.0,"Pretty good little hot for the money. Would like to have the plastic shield a bit more clear as it’s wavy in spots and a bit distorted, but overall a good buy."
4.0,Perfect high waist legging. Only downfall is the color rubs off. It stained my light gray purse and my white (dip polish) nails. Good price
4.0,It is ok.<br />Don't know how lonk it will hold up.
4.0,Suuuuper cute! I wear anything from a medium to an XL (depending on the fabric) b/c of large bust. The XL is fits true. Shirt is a little see-through but not too light. Will update review once returned to go one size down just for a little more hip-huggin.
4.0,"Great bag, lots of room, cool meshy material that dries fast & has lots of pockets. The handle could be just a few inches longer to carry on shoulder more comfortable but overall pretty great beach bag."
4.0,The dresses were beautiful but too small. I ordered the dresses for church.
4.0,"Bought two colors in this pattern. Both shirts fit perfectly. I am 5’2”, approximately 140 lbs. smaller waist but larger chest area. The small fit perfectly. It’s more of a loose, casual fit, but very comfortable. You can dress up with a cute pair of black pants or throw on some jeans or shorts and you’ll still look pulled together."
4.0,Very pretty but not quite as long as it looks in the picture. Maybe I have a larger neck...lol
4.0,"This bag is great quality. It isn't very wide but it fit a pair of sunglasses, my thin wallet, a small bottle of perfume, a couple pens, my phone, a pill packet, tampons, chapstick, lipstick and still had a little room for other important papers or knickknacks. The only issue I had with it is that it doesn't always snap shut easily (even when its empty). Overall I'm happy with the purse and I would buy it as a gift for someone too."
4.0,"this was just what I needed, love the zipper for holding my house key and phone while out walking!"
4.0,"I love these kind of bands.  If youve only ever used leather or other more solid metal bands, you will be pleasently surprised by this one.  It breathes so easily which greately reduces sweating and that unpleasent smell you can start to get on your skin because of it.  It has just the right amount of flex to make it super easy to wear as well.  And putting it on is a brease.  One side of the band has this hook that grabs a bar so you can set the latch in place.  Super easy once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />But i do have some negatives.  Ive purchased a few other chain link bands like this one, and this one is by far the thickest and stiffest.  This is compounded more by the fact that one band overlaps the other, giving it a very thic base.  If you compare it to the magnetic counter parts, the magnetic ones are way thinner.  Which is good for me as im at a computer typing all day, and having something tick pressing into my wrist is not very pleasent.<br /><br />If for some reason you cant do magnets, such as a laptop that has a magnetic sensor where you wrist rest, this would be a good alternative.  I would still shop around and see if you can find one thats thinner though.  Although that might be difficult to find."
4.0,Was way to small but pretty
4.0,I have to say that I was a little let down because they look more purple online than in person. They are lightweight but don't feel cheap. I love that they give you a soft case to keep them in.  Have already bought another style from them because I did like these so much.
4.0,"Could be a little more stretchy for so called plus size, but I’ve been ripped off far worse on clothing. I just can’t wear them up as high as the model shown."
4.0,"Debated whether to give these 3 or 4 stars. I went with 4 stars because they're great socks!  They fit perfectly, colors are bright - just as pictured, and they stay put, don't fall down.  So, overall, I'm really happy with . . . the socks . . .<br /><br />HOWEVER - the process to remove the packaging was unbelievably tedious!  Out of frustration, I did something totally out of character for me; - I actually counted the number of teeny tiny, itty bitty pieces of plastic that held each pair together, which needed to be cut  and carefully removed so I didn't rip the knit socks - then - add in the packaging at the top that held every 3 pairs together (obviously packaged this way because it's how they're sold retail), and last are the metal widgets that hold each sock to it's mate (always wondered why they did that) . . .<br /><br />AND . . . (drum roll please) THE GRAND TOTAL:  60 pieces of little things to be removed before the socks could be paired and put away.  All I can say is wow."
4.0,"These are some mid-range quality inserts. They're decently comfortable, but they could have some more give. Definitely not the bounciest, springiest ones I've ever had, but they're honestly not too bad. Definitely worth having in one of my pairs of shoes, even if they're not my main, go-to insert!"
4.0,Im usually an Extra Large but ordered Large on faith lol luckily it fit.. Very stretchy so it molds really well to your body! But if you have really big arms I would recommend a bigger size because I was pushing it! Im 6' and about 205lbs I was very happy I didnt even have to wear a body shaper because it held everything in well & the pattern kinda disguised my problem areas.. Would have givin a 5 star but the material is different from the picture the model's wearing but I read the previous reviews so I knew before I purchased. Always read the Reviews Ladies! Overall still satisfied with the product & fast delivery
4.0,"Nice plush robe, but it's more like a one size fits all (or most) that you see in stores. I've never found a men's size small in any robe in any store. Yet the label says small. I have somewhat long arms, but the sleeves completely cover my hands when standing. The material is really nice, but I picked up I don't know how many fuzzies, before and after I washed it. They stick to everything. Just a warning. But I'll deal with it since it's so cozy."
4.0,"Everything went as expected, i would recommend it."
4.0,"I like the necklace. Just know two things before buying: the chain is a long chain that isn't adjustable and the color. I was guessing it would be a little lower than normal, but it comes done to the end of my breast plate (which doesn't matter to me lol) and the color isn't a white as it looks, it's just a little tinted yellow. Other than that.... I'm happy with it and wear it"
4.0,Good quality that for the price
4.0,These were a gift for my father. They were cute. The packaging could have been better though.
4.0,"I traveled with them and this was great to organize my bags.  I traveled with a new airline and my bag wouldn't fit in the overhead compartment.  I had to take some items out.  Packing with this travel cube made it so easy to do that!  When I got to my destination, it was so easy to unpack!"
4.0,Love the way these shorts fit!! I bought 2 pairs!<br />Why in the world are they unhemmed?? Luckily I have a friend who will hem them for me with her machine!!
4.0,"I had just received this shirt today.<br />I really like this but so sad, size SMALL is too tight on me. I stand 5’1” and weigh 122 lbs. I should haven ordered MEDIUM size."
4.0,Didn’t care for it being elastic. I’m not a heavy person by any means and it doesn’t fit very well. I would not recommend this for people that have large wrists and/or are overweight. With that being said…I have several bands this brand not elastic and love them. Great quality and hold up well. That says a lot bring that I’m a stylist and it’s in water A LOT!
4.0,"Nice packaging, came in a zipper plastic pouch.  I ordered the medium and they fit nicely in my small(er) hands.  Snug, but I’m assuming they will give a little over time. I ordered the green and it’s what I would describe as a light Apple green. Can’t speak to durable or not, as I just opened the package.  If they turn out not to be for some reason in the future I will edit my review. At this point, very pleased and would buy again!"
4.0,"These fit as expected if you remember that they're men's size. :) My son who is 10 wears them, and they're just a tad too big. But not so big he can't wear them. They're not the softest socks and the image isn't very big. But they work for a unicorn-obsessed kid."
4.0,I mostly love this bag. But the bottle holder to way to small for even a water bottle. Also some of the stitching on the strap came loose but I just reinforced it myself.
4.0,Kinda cheap corners are sharp!
4.0,"I love these dainty stud earrings! They go so nicely with any hair color and style, any complexion, and  yet, they look discreet, and classic. They look like coral also, but a lot more reasonable!"
4.0,Ran big in the chest and longer than wanted.  But really cute otherwise
4.0,Nice material. Worth the price. Ordered a larger size and it was TOO big
4.0,"These glasses are cute and extravagant. I like them. The materials are so so, but that's to expect from a 10 dollars pair of glasses. They're nothing to rave about, but a cute, out of the ordinary fashion statement."
4.0,I love the message! They feel more like plastic than thin wood though. I STILL like them and plan on wearing them. I got one pair for me and another as a gift for a friend. I plan on ordering the brown pair soon as well.
4.0,"This dress fits great! The waist is almost an empire waist which is what I prefer for my body type. 34B, 5'5 115 lbs. The length is right below my knees.<br />I took away 1 star because it smelled pretty bad. I washed in detergent and vinegar. Hung to dey and then ironed. When I oronex, the smell came back.<br /> It took 5 weeks to receive I did not realize it was shipping from China. That was my fault."
4.0,"Not very nice, did not look like one in picture"
4.0,"Little bit smaller than expected, Still a quality product for the price."
4.0,"I love the fit of this flowy leopard print dress.  Right now, I am wearing it with boots and leggings but it would be just as cute with sandals in the summer.  I am 5’7”, 127lbs and the small fit beautifully.  It flows and covers in all the right places and isn’t tight or restrictive at all.  In my opinion, it’s a fantastic deal at the current listed price and I would definitely order again!"
4.0,It makes you sweat like crazy underneath it. It cinches perfectly. The only thing is that the velcro isn't has secure as it needs to be so bending makes the cincher part come undone.
4.0,It met my wife's expectation.
4.0,"My daughter is a BIG Wings fan and she loved this charm, was a bit bigger than we thought which was good :) was here as promised"
4.0,Very cute shirt. Sizes are a little small
4.0,"This was a last minute purchase, and I'm glad I was forced to change my daughter's outfit. She loves it! I only wish it was lined underneath. When taking pictures, you see the white underneath, which cheapens the look. Aside from that, amazing!"
4.0,Love them. However they are mine now since they were wayyyyy to small for my husband.
4.0,"Its very pretty and i loved the colors. I'm 5'6, 150lbs and ordered a small. I probably could've gone medium, but small still fit fine. It didn't go to floor length as pictured. It hit me about mid shin which is why i gave it only 4 stars"
4.0,"It got here WAY earlier than expected which is cool. Cool necklace too I'm a huge fan of this series, but the chain is pretty short. Luckily I have some extra gold chains lying around that I can transfer it to. But for the price it was a good buy."
4.0,Good hose. Quality seems good. They only issue I have had is the tops tend to curl back if worn without a garter.
4.0,Good for the price. The black paint is poor but I clean it. There are silver now.
4.0,"Just as described.  I do feel that it's a little over-priced, but it was for my grandson."
4.0,"Very colorful and stylish, however, the price could be lower. They need to step their game up against croakies."
4.0,Bought for a school dance.  It was a bit big but fine overall.  Made well and good for the price.  Seems like it would be easily dyeable to match any other color needs.
4.0,"I personally am not a huge fan of the material on this, but my husband did not seem to mind.  I really like the color and the fit on him.  He says it is breathable and comfortable so that it is a win.  This can also be worn with jeans or you can dress it up a little with some khaki or black pants."
4.0,"Almost perfect, but being 5'8 they didn't exactly fit all the way. They were a little short and I can't pull them up all the way. Otherwise beautiful."
4.0,Was a gift for my mom and she loved it
4.0,I thought it was a full circle. It has an open back....that is the only disappointment.  It is a pretty ring.
4.0,"First off: Rating the warmth of this type of gloves is not a good idea.<br />They could use a little more padding, but the worst part of the material used is that it faded quickly in the sun."
4.0,This is a great suit. I swim daily in a chlorine pool and they hold up better than you could ask for.  Much better than the super expensive name suits.<br />My only problem. The suit used to have a very long thin draw cord which always broke after a while. It now has a very short heavier cord. Like shoe laces. Except the cord is extremely short and will certainly pull into the suit. Never to be see again!!  I will buy again. I'm a big guy and they fit great!
4.0,Great chain for the price. Would highly recommend.
4.0,"Good fit, but pretty short in the torso. If you have a long torso be prepared for a bit of a draft."
4.0,the shirt is lovely and feels nice. after reading the other reviews I bought a large instead of my usual medium and  it fit perfectly. I plan to but in different colors and patterns.
4.0,"Fit, thumb hole, 3/4 arm, good compression.  A trifle snug"
4.0,"Color is just as shown, fits somewhat true to size but it’s kind of a boxy fit and shorter than expected"
4.0,"Fit true to size. Minimized the appearance of my belly. Didn't  completely hide my belly, but definitely made it look smaller from all angles."
4.0,The color is subtle and the frame material is comfortable on the bridge if my nose and ears.<br />I wear a hearing aid and some frames are uncomfortable on my ears.
4.0,Love it very pretty was hoping it would be smaller but I do like wearing it
4.0,"They are very nice and comfortable. They are very good at reducing glare. The only dislike is when looking to far left, or right, when driving, partial view is blocked by side of the sunglasses. With my old sunglasses I could see through the side.  I have look more carefully to side. Peripheral vision is reduced."
4.0,"These are nice boxer briefs: soft, stretchy, but they fit somewhat strangely. The leg portion hangs almost like regular boxers as opposed to stretching around my thighs. I have never had this problem with other underwear, so it may just be a fit issue with this particular brand.<br />Also, there is no fly in the front. I really prefer having that, but I guess that's just a personal thing."
4.0,"They are made well. The only problem I've had is the laces are very stiff and when laced, don't lay flat on the shoe. They stick out. Wished they would be less stiff. The quality of the laces are very good and seems they will last a long time"
4.0,"I am giving 4 star since they are super cute, but not giving 5 starts because they are a dark purple and not a pink that is displayed in the picture."
4.0,"I bought the blue and the black dress. I'd say it's true to size (it's an oversize fit). Not the thickest or most luxurious linen but light and airy which is what I wanted. The blue, and I imagine all of the lighter colors, will be somewhat see through. I'm fine with this as I can throw on a slip if I'm wearing this as a casual dress, and fine also as a swim coverup. This is nice enough to wear after the pool or beach to grab lunch in and not feel like a total shlub. This also arrived earlier than expected, as it's shipped from China and not an amazon fulfillment center in the US. I ordered in late May and it arrived in Mid June. So about 3 weeks for me."
4.0,"Love the soft material. The size however was a little big on her since she's only 4 months old and I bought a 6 month as there was now 3 month option, however it's nice quality and soft material."
4.0,This fits ok. Not the most flattering but it will do
4.0,Very happy with this sports bra. True to size too
4.0,"I love the clean look of this clip-on sunglasses and it's available in the oversized lens that I am looking for. However I wish they were available in more colors/shape (eg.Cateye) which are already in their flippable collections.  However, the clip could have a tighter grip to prevent the clip-ons from sliding off kilter.  But after I added 2 small silicon disc's at the outer top corners, the problem is solved. Thus I'll be checking to see if any new colors/shapes are made available."
4.0,nice material love the fit
4.0,....would be awesome if it illuminated.  Great details and the weight adds to the realness of the item.  Looks great with my other Marvel Legend items.
4.0,"Beautiful material and extremely soft, you can just wrap yourself up in this sweater."
4.0,Fits perfectly. Very flattering on anyone. The only complaint is a broken strap the 2nd time it was worn.
4.0,Thought the material was different but it is still beautiful and fits well
4.0,Good quality for the cost. I wish they were a tad longer but they do the job
4.0,"This was a fun and interesting way to keep my money safe from myself. I am the classic &#34;play it back&#34; girl and I'm thankful that I had it, I do wish it were a little bit bigger. Some of the bills got caught up and wouldn't allow any more to be put in..overall it will do what you want it to, if you use it. Great little bank."
4.0,"Love this skirt! The only issue with it is that it runs large - I am normally between a small and a medium and I had to purchase the extra small for it to fit well. Otherwise, super great quality!"
4.0,"Tucks all my hair neatly away. Only thing I dislike is that sometimes throught my day I have to tug it forward because it seems to slump. Could just be the weight of my ponytail, but it isn't any sort of a deal breaker."
4.0,"Overall a nice suit.<br />I personally ended up not liking the ruffles but that's a personal choice. The straps are a little wider than I would have preferred but again, that is all preference. They are very comfortable especially for supporting larger chests."
4.0,You will need a rubber backing clip to hold it securely and keep it from spinning.
4.0,"I like the long length and the weight of it.  It's really shiny, too."
4.0,They are very pretty and very rich in color. Of course they are big being a carat each. Nice to wear on occasions.
4.0,the cloth is thick
4.0,Bought this for my son to wear under his basketball jersey. He liked it very much and the price was great.
4.0,Good but for the price.
4.0,Fit nicely and was great for a luau party. I put it in a regular wash cycle though and now the ties are all twisted and won't lie flat.
4.0,The fit is great loved packaging
4.0,Very good for me.
4.0,"I usually fit in a Large size with this brand. However, I had to return that size because it was too tight. I reordered it in XL and it fits perfectly. Wish the pink and teal blue were available in XL. I would buy them all."
4.0,Awesome earrings just a little heavier and bigger than I expected
4.0,"They are indeed polarized and they’re fashionable like I wanted. I expected them to be bigger honestly, that’s what I prefer but they are my 2nd go to pair of sunglasses. Only complaint is they’re too tight above my ears and since it’s plastic there’s no stretching them at all"
4.0,I bought this for a dress for a wedding at the beach. It is a beautiful pin but too small for the dress. I still love the pin and wear it frequently. Read my story Coming Through the Fog. [...]
4.0,Exactly as described. Perfect fit and nice material.
4.0,Luckily my daughter likes a little baggy. It's hard to know the true size by looking at the models. Some times the sizes don't match
4.0,Exactly how the picture portrayed them. Good sunglasses. And they're so inexpensive I can get more colors!
4.0,Work good but are too big. It would be nice if there were a smaller size to choose.
4.0,"I really like this shirt. It's very cute, but the phrase is smaller and higher than expected. Still very cute tho! The lettering is a true red but the coloring is off in this photo."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:4990df01776e708393e737d367824caa]] I just love vintage style dresses, and wear crinoline/petticoats frequently. I needed a gray petticoat, and was looking for one that wasn’t too fluffy but has the right amount of fluff. This is a two-layer crinoline with a taffeta lining that helps protect your legs from scratching.  The product does come wrinkled and flattened from the mailing, and washing and drying is not recommended. I used my steamer on it and it puffed up beautifully. This seller has many different colors and I’m eager to buy a new color! I’m 5”3, 130 lbs and the dress I’m wearing in the video normally comes to my knees without the petticoat.<br />PROS<br />• Size is as expected, length as expected<br />• Taffeta lining to protect from irritation<br />• Color was as expected<br />• Amount of fluff/puff was as expected for two layers<br />• The fitted waist is comfortable, and doesn’t dig into skin<br />CONS<br />• Not a smooth transition from fitted waist to the petticoat, looks odd under the dress – TIP: Try wearing a belt to avoid seeing that transition<br /><br />The lack of smooth transition is enough to deduct a star, I will have to wear it with dresses that pair well with a belt. I did receive this petticoat for a discount, in exchange for my honest opinion. The opinion I’ve expressed is my own, and I am in no way compensated for it. I rely on honest reviews before making my purchases, and I have tried to provide good insight for his product. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have."
4.0,Bought size 2-3 years since my daughter is 2 years old and wears either 18 months or 2T in US sizes.  I couldn't even pull the shorts over her legs.  The seller immediately remedied this by sending a larger size.  The outfit is very cute.  The top will work better with capris since it is pretty long compared to the shorts but both pieces can be worn with lots of other clothes.
4.0,"I wouldn't consider this heavy duty, but more of a regular belt.  I do like the Cobra-style buckle.  The belt itself is just a regular nylon web belt.  It looks and feels good with no sharp corners and is comfortable for wearing all day.  But I wouldn't use it for much more than holding up my pants since it's only a single layer web.  The buckle itself is easily adjustable and another reason to only use for basic utility."
4.0,"liked that it held, wish you could hold more than one at a time"
4.0,"It's an amazing concept and I loved the art!! The only things I didn't quite care for is that the shirt behind the design is sticky and tacky after wearing it in Texas humidity (which is unfair, since that is common in Texas) and the quality of the tshirt. I mean, it isn't enough to dissuade me from buying from them again, but it might not be first on my list.<br /><br />I did receive this product in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Find large-cute dress
4.0,"I received this hoodie in three days!  My son was so excited and he loves it!  If he is happy, I am happy."
4.0,Very nice. Feels like cheap plastic but doesn’t look that way.
4.0,"I love this purse. It's worth it and it's very unique too. Although they use basic low quality zipper, I still like it overall."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:b5e806cafe826ba8facb6d4e47b289b6]] This bracelet fits well and I bought a size up to ensure the charms fit well and the slid right on. I have ordered another one because the fit was in point.
4.0,It's very pretty and delicate.
4.0,Love the necklace.  Only problem is where the chanin connects to the clasp it catches my hair and pulls my hair out!<br />Had to take pliers and squeeze around it and that seemed to help
4.0,"This was a gift for a young girl, waiting to hear if it fits…she really seemed to like it! I did not realize there were 2 bracelets. One was Stitch and the other was SpongeBob? Kind of a strange mix but nice surprise."
4.0,Soft and it fits well
4.0,Good looking dress. Size fits.
4.0,"I'd suggest thinking of these gloves as borderline disposable.  They're serviceable, but the fabric is thin and tends to tear at the seams if it's stretched too much.  The gloves are maybe a U.S. size 7, but will stretch to accommodate larger hands.  There seems to be excessive material bunched up at the finger tips.  If they were priced higher, I'd give them a lower rating.  At 50 cents a pair, they're a good deal as long as you can accept their limitations."
4.0,"Sadly the people who make clothing have no standards for the different sizes. I have found the only way to be sure you are getting a good fit is to be able to put the shirt on. The only company that is consistent is JC Penney, but they don't offer the car shirts and Hawaiian shirts that I like."
4.0,"Lots of different looks for this. You can absolutely use this as a swim suit cover or you can make this into a pretty cute outfit by wearing a neutral color tank top or camisole underneath. I ordered this in pink with teal colored flowers. The colors compliment each other beautifully. The shawl can be worn a few different ways. You can wear it with the buttons in the front or the back (the buttons cannot be undone) or you can have the buttons resting on your shoulders. The shawl is light and airy. I also have to add that if desired, you can absolutely wear this as a scarf too! This is going to be wonderful for many summer outings. I think it would protect your shoulders from the sun if you are sitting outside at the park or beach too! Can't wait to incorporate this into my summer outfit rotation!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"First of all, these are NOT greywash at all as pictured. They are jet back with a kind of faux-leather type of look. Zero grey.<br /><br />Size-wise I always wear a 10, I bought these in a 10 and they fit pretty well. If anything, they're slightly small but not uncomfortable enough to not wear them. I've only worn them twice and they're still very rigid, so I'm assuming they'll take a while to break in.. but that's to be expected with almost any boot.<br />They've got a nice rounded toe so you definitely don't get that ugly 'clown feet' look some boots give. Overall I'm really satisfied! I'm happy they're jet black, they've got cute little side pockets on each boot and the structure seems pretty sturdy so far. I'd suggest these.<br /><br />Edit: I added a picture in the 'customer pictures' section if you're curious about the color like I initially was."
4.0,It’s light
4.0,"I bought this for work, I am not actually in the field of doing physical labour to need a high spec shoe, but I do work on an industrial compound and need steel toe protection. I was shocked at how light it is and would definitely recommend for someone wanting a lighter fit. As with a few safety shoes however, I would recommend a insole pad especially for the heel, as it is a bit hard on the inside. I have not felt skiddish other than if I go past grease and transition to a tiled office. It has room in the front and back and the toe area has width for your toes. Overall sturdy shoe. We shall see how long it lasts though."
4.0,The chain could be better. It's not the best.  A friend and I used to crack out to Revenge so this was a perfect addition to her birthday gift.
4.0,"Nice shade, nice fit, and a good pattern of distressing. The rise was flattering and they felt great. Length was good as well, worked well with both flats and cuffed for boots. Overall very pleased! A great find!"
4.0,"I love this pretty bracelet. But wish it could've come in my size wrist, so it wouldn't have the dangling chain."
4.0,Awsome fit! Got my money's worth if not more! Very stylish part if my daily wardrobe. It  is a bit difficult putting it on making sure it does not rip because it is fitted on me. Make sure you get a size larger if not two sizes larger! Either way it will look great! I'm planing on buying all colors.
4.0,Great Product @ an Outstanding Price!!!
4.0,"Good , for the price"
4.0,"fabric is thin, and dress is shorter than pictured, but fit is flattering and the print is pretty."
4.0,This dress is really comfy and casual and bonus it has pockets. It fits well and I am pleased with it.
4.0,"Pretty comfortable pants and seem to be durable so far. Only real complaint, the main pockets are cut weird, the go straight up and down, and don’t extend close enough to the hip. Makes it a bit strange to get keys/phone etc in and out of the pockets."
4.0,The packaging could be improved. It didn't come in a box it came in a plastic bag-like packaging but the kimono was undamaged so I'm fine with it. It is a beautiful kimono and the color is vivid not faint. Also the belt will be hidden in one of the sleeves. It's little too long for my mother who is ~162 cm<br />B/c when I try it on it touches my ankle and I'm 170 cm. It'll be a xmas gift for my mother and I think she'll like it
4.0,"A bit Tight in underarms and shoulder straps and bust. I am very small busted, 5'9, 135 and ordered medium. Beautiful dress and comfortable with a bra top underneath. ( Can't button top 2 buttons)"
4.0,I like it though it is a little bit larger than my expectation
4.0,34C fits more like a 36B.  Cups ok but the band seems to run big.  For cheap bras I'm not complaining too much.
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, but beware - runs small!"
4.0,"This past weekend, while sitting still deer hunting for about six hours straight from about 6 am to noon, I could feel a 15-20 mile and hour wind in 30 degree temperatures on my arms but not on my chest and back. The wind chill was probably cooler than 30 degrees. It wasn't bad enough that I felt like needing to go get warmed up, but it was noticeably cooler than the rest of my body. It might have become an issue if it were about 5 or 10 degrees cooler outside. I was wearing two pair of long underwear tops and a long sleeve t-shirt under the coat. It might have made a difference if the long sleeve shirt was thicker. I really like all of the pockets and especially the magnets. I don't know if it is waterproof."
4.0,I actually bought a size smaller than normal and was happy with the fit. Very soft and fuzzy feeling. Held up well after being washed. Nice style and fit.
4.0,I wear glasses and my optometrist didn't have brown tortoise eyeglasses. So I found these and realized the lenses aren't glass they're plastic which means I would have to pay extra to get glass put in to use my prescription. It's going to cost hundreds of dollars to do that so..... Although I like the frame unfortunately they're going back. I might as well just take a pair that my insurance will pay for. You can not use these to put a prescription in. These are for people that have good vision and just want them for the blue light protection.
4.0,My son loves it. That is all that matters. He is 10 years old. However... he had to cut slit for the button to go into because the one it came with was too small for the button. And he has to use tape for some other reason. Just sayin’.
4.0,super cute but i suggest ordering a size up because it is quite tight
4.0,"I am a natural 32DD, 5'5 and 125 lbs. This bra is gorgeous. Being bigger chested, I always am looking for a good strapless bra but it's hard to find one that has enough support but still looks natural (I don't love the super padded/structured look and opt for underwire cupless bras usually. Having so many clasps in the back keeps it from sliding down and the underwires offer enough support to give me a bit of lift without making me look too ""fake.""<br /><br />The cups are a bit wider than I wish they were, so there's just a bit of gaping at the top. If you are between sizes I recommend sizing down.<br /><br />Otherwise, really pretty and practical."
4.0,"I am 40 c, 170lbs, 5'2, 3 months post baby and i ordered a 2xl due to the measurements on the site. I could have gotten away with an xl or even a large when i lose the rest of my baby weight. Its a great dress i love it. The length comes below my knees so its great for office wear. It zips in the back. I gave it 4 stars because the measurements are off but its a great material and poofs when you spin without a ruffle under it."
4.0,"This is a beautiful cross.  And, the size is very nice too."
4.0,"Compre este artículo para mi bebé de 6 meses y le quedo perfecto y cómodo , el material es muy suave ,, me encanto.."
4.0,Wore it to a concert and looked great! The only thing is the shorts are a little thin! I sized up as well due to other reviews!
4.0,Cute small
4.0,Sent these  to my daughter-in-law during Christmas and she loved them very much:)
4.0,"I got these because I wear a full beard and conventional masks won't cover it, and create an annoying dent in the hair. I can arrange my beard comfortably under these & it stays in better condition.<br />  It doesn't offer very much protection from the virus but it complies with the requirements of wearing a mask."
4.0,it was just what I wanted. i'm going to a wedding and i'll wear a vintage style dress and pearls will take it to the soft elegant place i'm seeking<br />t
4.0,Runs small but is still lovely! I have not washed or worn it yet.
4.0,"cloth is pretty thin, and no padding. There is an awkward piece of fabric sticking out by the straps. Overall very cute. Definitely will wear in warm weather. Will need a skin colored thong or white bra to wear with. Still worth the price!"
4.0,"I wasn't sure if I should purchase this, as a little soap and water would do the same thing, right?<br /><br />It is gentle, and literally one or two drops does the job. I would say that it's worth a buy, considering that the NuBra is fairly expensive and this product may add to to its lifespan! The bottle will last forever so lots of bang for your buck, even though it is a very small bottle! (About the size of a travel sized shampoo)."
4.0,This was a great deal..so I bought it..also to get more protection with the Covid getting worse this new year 2022 winter..it comes with the filters for added layers of protection.The new news is just cloth masks aren't enough.this is a really good mask!.. Fits well the ear piece works well to fit how you like ..and the filter will fit in the mask ..you have to work it in a bit ..to fit it but it's no problem.the material ..cloth is nice in my opinion ..seems well made and fits down around my chin..no complaints of any about the ear straps either..they are adjustable.the ONLY THING..for me..is the sides of the mask have a gap..or a opening just a bit so it's not completely air tight as I would like it..darn..its other wise... great!...I'm hoping when I hand wash it..and it drys that it will shrink a bit and it will fit a bit better..it maybe I need to figure to tighten the strings on the ears..? I want no gaps..on the sides ..I'll figure it out ..then I would buy more..because it is a great mask other wise.
4.0,"my daughter loves it, but then, anything with Frozen seems to be something my daughter loves.."
4.0,Would like short sleeves
4.0,This fit loose and comfy as expected & the design was exactly as pictured. The material is more like a nightgown than a cover up though.
4.0,"It's wallet! Holds my cards, ID and money! No animals were exploited or tortured to make it!"
4.0,yo yo bruh thee sunglas look rely cleean thats a bet 100
4.0,It s very elegant and has a great price. It has a more yellow shine than what I expected. Arrived right on time.
4.0,"its hard to explain exactly how i feel about this shirt. the stitching was a bit different than i expected, not that its a problem or anything, but i love the top. it is lightweight and comfortable and i would totally buy from these guys again if this is the kind of stuff they have to offer."
4.0,"Love it. Top feature not really moon phases, but that's ok because it looks neat."
4.0,This dress is somewhat thin but super comfy and was such a success for my holiday party and for being festive at work. I received so many compliments.
4.0,"Haven't worn it out yet but I think it's cute. I ordered a medium because the reviews I read said to size up, but it seems a bit big. Maybe those people like very loose clothing. The tie around the waist takes care of that though.The only thing that I don't like is that the fabric isn't sewn together right below the tie, so there is a little gap if I tighten it to fit. There are also only three little metal clasps holding the dress together above the tie. This works fine to close the dress but I'll probably have to either wear an undershirt or add additional closures."
4.0,"Great quality and not too hot, but feels cold and wet after you sweat. Dries fast tho. Doesn’t shrink in dryer."
4.0,Lots of options. Decent quality for the cheap cost
4.0,I love the color and the style. Its very cute. The card holders are snug on one side but I made it work.
4.0,"Really wish it was like 3 inches longer to fit at/just below my knee (modest & work appropriate). 5’7”, 160lb, size L fits great (except the length) - Even so, I’ve purchased a few of these dresses. The solid colors are made of different material than the pattern dresses, and unfortunately the solids show the sweat stains (*facepalm) ... but I know to buy the cute patterned dresses now ;)  Love!"
4.0,"This dress is wonderful! I'm a 34 DDD and the Large was a little big in the bust, but I made due! The bottom half is SO see through though. If I didn't have a nude slip, I would have to return this dress."
4.0,"This wallet is well built. The design is excellent. I like the fact it has the anti theft feature. The size is perfect if you like to carry your wallet in your front pocket. It has 3 dedicated card slots inside, plus 2 additional pockets on either side of he fold as well as a see through window and 1 additional pocket on the outside. I have about 10 cards including credit, debit, insurance, etc.  shipping was slow but the product seems worth the wait."
4.0,Material is very soft and comfortable. Only problem is that it runs short. I ordered an xxl and would expect more coverage. I am 5’7”.
4.0,Always in the way
4.0,But don’t like the stuff too much and fitting is good .
4.0,Fabric is nearly as heavy and stretchy as I'd hoped but it's adequate for my needs.
4.0,This ring is pretty much exactly as I expected it to be. The pearl is a little bigger in real life than it looks in the picture but still absolutely adorable!
4.0,Nice casual piece for jeans & sweaters
4.0,"Not as flows of material, but I do like it"
4.0,"This definitely does the job so I appreciate it, but the satin is definitely poor quality"
4.0,"Just what I needed - a V-neck top with 3/4 sleeves.  The fabric is very comfortable and it is not flimsy at all, as so many tops are lately.  I bought it in 3 colors and I like them all."
4.0,Husband was happy with it’s quality and had easy to follow instructions
4.0,Little light for the price but I live in Texas so that may be helpful. Love the design.
4.0,"I love these. I am usually a medium (5'3&#34; 130 lbs) and I got a small. They fit nicely, but don't offer any compression. The length from crotch to waist is very long, so there is no muffin top OR front wedgies.<br />My only negative is that these aren't completely opaque. This isn't an issue, as the fit was perfect, but if they were any tighter, the fabric would stretch and become more see through."
4.0,Cute dress but the color is not black.  It looks more like a dark maroon or brown.  Also there is a tie on the halter that ties on one shoulder not shown in the photo so was unexpected.
4.0,"Not bad, bright colored and loose. Thin but cannot see throug."
4.0,Alittle snug but fits cute dress
4.0,Didn't last long they tore
4.0,[[VIDEOID:fb572cd69c43435d968861ca1d3d0701]] It’s a great casual shirt. I love that it’s long enough to cover my butt. It’s really soft . I’m not sure it’s worth $22 but it is a great shirt. I am wearing a medium..
4.0,nice for handmade jewelry. easy to work with and looks good.
4.0,Very nice ring. Feel comfortable. Nice size.
4.0,It slightly long from bottom but if you wear heel it wl look better
4.0,Was nit impressed with my bonnet and will not order again
4.0,My ass isn't huge and they only cover half of it.
4.0,"Nice, fun tie.  Good service. Got it in time for the party."
4.0,I like it and i wish if they have a slim one
4.0,These earrings are super cute!  I did have to readjust some of the findings so the hooks weren’t sideways or backwards.
4.0,"I got the 3 pack with the snowflake, dots, and paint splatter. They are cute patterns. Overall, they are decent compression socks and a good quality sock, but the compression is not as much as I would prefer. I prefer a compression of 20-30 mmHg and these were much less than that. Also, the colors are not as vibrant as the picture.<br /><br />If you don't need/want a higher compression, then I highly recommend these socks."
4.0,"Cute dress, gonna spruce it up with a petticoat to dress up as a Halloween Ms. Frizzle and blow my toddler's mind (he's obsessed). Fabric is stretchy and bouncy, feels very thin, so expect to wear a slip underneath if you're at all busty like me, and the slight stretch in the chest reveals your bra color. I'm a size 12-14, 38D, 5'4"", the XL fits me just about right, just a little extra stretch in the bust but still comfy. Hits just at/below the knee on me."
4.0,"Great fit, true to size. Worked perfect for our Hawaii trip."
4.0,Very cute shoes. They have a slight smell to them that my wife could smell in the car.  Went away after a while.  Kind of like a rubber tire smell.
4.0,helps
4.0,Very comfortable..true to size.
4.0,"I have only worn them a few times but seem to be holding up well. I would describe them as comfortable, breathable and versatile."
4.0,"The fit was perfect with plenty of room was concerned it might be somewhat tight but not.  Satisfied, I wear it mostly to work when cold instead of a coat."
4.0,"Well-built and comfortable, with a sturdy feel. Darker than average sunglasses, but not as dark as some of the Locs I've owned.."
4.0,Like the pattern and fit
4.0,"Fun summer dress with fashionable colorful print.  The fabric is a good weight and I am happy with this dress.  It binds a tiny bit in the shoulders, but I was looking for a dress with sleeves..."
4.0,I love the look of the bracelet and the fit (even tho I have large wrists) but the wire ends poke me. I had to do a bit with pliers to make it more comfortable & it still bothers me after awhile.
4.0,"Really like these - wish they came in a slightly smaller frame size and I have a large head for a woman. Other brands are too small (narrow) for me, so I'm stuck with this, but the progressive configeration is better than the $400 ones from my eye doc :/"
4.0,I was looking for breathable shorts to wear in Florida and in summer in general and these were the perfect ones. I loved them so much I went back and ordered it in other colors.
4.0,"Looked good, but style is more like.tapered leg sweatpants, than stretched leggings. Sleeves re also very baggy. Overall, it was ok."
4.0,It's beautiful! Very delicate
4.0,Straps were just a little long on me
4.0,"**Update**<br />Worn dress 3 times. On 3rd time noticed the seam came apart in armpit....<br /><br />Dress is really cute, however, sleeves are little short and the dress length requires leggings or shorts under. Due to sleeve and dress length i should have upsized but then the neck and chest would have been huge.<br />I do love the look and pockets though!"
4.0,Very nice product and my daughter love the material.
4.0,It is a beautiful dress. I think the sizes run a little big.
4.0,"The gloves are constructed with quality material and stitching, creating a classy look for a relatively inexpensive price. The liner is soft and warm, but the gloves seem more intended for keeping hands warm while driving or walking in the city rather than protection from intensely cold climates.<br /><br />Generations of women in my family have worn ISO Isotoner gloves of a similar timeless style. The gloves last years and are classic enough to pair with dressy outfits, but do take care to avoid snagging the glove fabric on Velcro coat closures."
4.0,I like this a lot. I had a different one but it wasnt sterling silver so it turned. I got this one so I would still have something similar. Much smaller than I expected but I still like it. Fits my pandora.
4.0,A very nice dress my daughter looks very nice. I thought at first that my order was going to be delay but the seller came through with everything on time
4.0,Nice jacket but larger than expected
4.0,"Nice material, came with the belt, very stretchy and comfortable. Only complaint is that the zipper sucks, It sticks right above the  waist when zipping up and down so I have to just leave it as is and put it on from over my head rather than stepping in and pulling it up from the waist. A small issue so keeping it."
4.0,"Nice jacket but runs  WAY large.  I'm a size 10-12 on top, and the size Large was huge on me.  In fairness, the Janska website does say that a Large is more for a 14-16 size, but the size chart on Amazon's website reflects 10-12 as a typical Large.<br />I'm returning and ordering a Medium to see if the fit is better.  Material is super soft and the design is pretty.  Great red color...slightly brighter than the picture.  Good light/medium weight jacket for a California winter.  It's not lined on the inside, so it's just one layer of fleece material, but the material is warm, and the neckline makes it feel like you're wearing a scarf."
4.0,good size but not enough pockets
4.0,Very nice suit. It may however be too short length wise for very tall women.<br />The quality is good and it is flattering. I am 5'4 and weigh 145 lbs. Normal size is a ten or 12. I ordered XXL which is the 2XL. I am glad I did because it fits perfectly.
4.0,I gave it 4 stars because the glasses are great. I was disappointed to receive the wrong case and it was too much trouble to send it back for replacement.
4.0,"These are some very cool shades, I just got them in the mail today. Everything looks more clear with them on."
4.0,It’s been awhile since I’ve tried one of these on so it was quite a feat slipping these over my shoulders then adjusting everything to cover correctly. The pair I received is just ever so slightly off center in the front but that can be accounted for by my body not being perfectly asymmetric. The pads protect modesty and do not move or shift. The bands were tight enough to keep everything in place with no slippage. Wore these while doing household chores and never had to readjust all day. Very comfortable.
4.0,Very thin plastic feeling product.
4.0,Style and comfort.
4.0,I think the dress fits well- I ordered a small. it came with a few quirks like the hole the waist tie goes through is visible and the button on the chest is too high so the fabric pops open. But other than that I feel the dress is very flattering and the material is soft. I will keep it for the price.
4.0,"This women's round neck from pleated chiffon cami tank top by JJ Perfectionis a cute accessory to add to any wardrobe, I just wish it fit a little better.  The shirt itself fits, but the arm holes are huge and you can see my bra and the side of my boob right through it.  The shirt itself is very soft and flowing, and looks great on.  It does have 2 layers of light material, and you are still able to see dark colors through it, but if you wear a tan or white bra you can't really tell.  The front is pleated and so it falls nicely down the front.  It also has a key hole cut out in the back of the shirt which is cute and comes with an extra button in case you lose the one on it.  The length of the top is perfect and it falls right at my waist line.  Don't order it though if you are the kind of person who likes long tops.  The layer underneath is actually shorter than the top layer which creates an illusion of a light blue stripe at the bottom of the shirt, it doesn't bother me though, I think it looks nice.  I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,very cool and pretty but the 6 is a bit small.....and tight...but very stunning...............  i would def. reccommend it for a friend
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this purchase. It looks a lot nicer than the photo. It is extremely pretty, especially in the evening. I wish the skirt was a tad long but it is still very appropriate and lovely. I'm a size 6-8 and it is true to size. The quality is very good the price."
4.0,Good bracelet but it arrived scratched up.
4.0,I LOVE this sweater it's so cool. The image on it is perfect. My only complaint is that it's a bit snug I got a large and so jm thinking its not a true large. So if you like youjackets bigger I'd go a size up. Other than that I love it!
4.0,This item fits small and shrinks easily. Ok for a couple of wears and nothing moee
4.0,"These pj's are made with a thin, stretchy and smooth material. They fit good. I just wish they had pockets. If you are looking for more cozy and warm pj's these might not be for you."
4.0,"I was looking for a light weight parka especially for the less than $20 price.  This is a much heavier winter coat, I'm guessing for colder climates (Florida here.)  Despite that I'm keeping the jacket because I was impressed by the quality and fit as expected--I just don't know when I will use it. The zipper is slightly wonky but the jacket provides buttons that can be used to close it in place of the zipper.  It is fur lined throughout the inside.  I thought the fur on the hood could be removed but it is the entire hood can be unzipped off."
4.0,"So this is my favorite swim suit buuuttttt, I have DD and if I'm not constantly on alert then the public pool will definitely get a surprise. Also the top breast parts do not come together at the band like in the picture"
4.0,"Really great face mask! I bought this in July of 2020. Writing this review in February of 2021. I love the fact that it has replaceable filters without the vent thing. I also like the ear loop system. The only 2 things i would change, is some sort of stitching on either side of the nose wire to keep it centered in the mask. I ended up stitching with some black thread and it did the job. I also would change the loop adjuster design. They have split slightly up the side but are still totally functional. I take the rubber things off and wash mine in the washing machine on gentle cycle 1x a week. Held up really well. Still use it on a daily basis. Comfortable and hasn't fallen apart."
4.0,Looks like photo except it doesn't drape quite as much on me.  I have not washed it yet so don't know if it will shrink.  Colors bright and not washed out looking.
4.0,"The glasses came immediately and in perfect shape.  I actually did not order the correct glasses, but that was not the fault of this company.  I just didn't know that the new 3D movies use a different 3D technology so the old red and blue 3D glasses don't work.  Not sure what kind I should have gotten.<br /><br />These are great for the old stuff though."
4.0,"Good for its price, you het what you pay for"
4.0,"The paint chips quite easily, but the case itself works great. I dropped my phone down a flight of stairs and onto concrete, and the phone was perfectly fine."
4.0,"Very comfortable and warm, yet I can easily breath when it is across my face."
4.0,"Light weight, but definitely size up"
4.0,"I like this hat alot, but I had to give it 4 stars because it is somewhat large on my head."
4.0,It is a great blouse. It can be dressed up with slacks or skirt or dressed down with a nice pair of jeans. I like the lightweight feel and its loose fitting which i always like. For $12 it was a good deal for me.
4.0,"Got this colorful bands for my Apple Watch series 5. They are durable, nicely made, compatible and fits perfectly. Easy to put on and take off. Wearing this band for long time gives little irritation to skin if tightly wore I keep it little loose and take it off in the evenings. This are unisex and can be great for ladies to match the colors with their dress. Nice alternative at affordable price."
4.0,Really cute and warm but very easy to snag on zippers or jewelry.
4.0,"This is probably my own fault but I didn't realize this was a wrap around dress.  It makes it hard to tie in a proper way but it is beautiful.  I am keeping the tags on and debating back-and-forth whether or not I'm gonna keep it. I kind a like a dress that one little knot keeping on my body, and one that fits more because it's not just tight where it's tied, but it is a beautiful dress."
4.0,the color as described
4.0,For the price the hair looks nice but is a little rough and gets tangled. I am trying to loc my hair but it is short.  I’m not an expert braided but the final outcome was great and lasted long! Will order more for refreshing my style!!!
4.0,"Giving this 4 stars because it's soooo cute!  The top is too big both in cup size and around, the bottoms is two sizes smaller!  I should give less but again so cute.  Guessing if you're top heavy with a boy tiny butt this is made for you.  Good luck picking a size...."
4.0,Nice a little but love them.
4.0,Even nicer in person !!!!
4.0,I purchased these swim shorts for my son to wear to the beach on his July 4th to show his patriotic side and look nice. They fit just as expected and the color is just as pictured in the photo.
4.0,"This arrived promptly,  It doesn't look exactly like the picture the color was lighter and does not vary in dark or lightness but it is nice.  The fabric is  light weight and not the best material but it's still nice .  I ordered a small and it fit perfectly because I read the reviews and ordered another  one which was a medium and it was way to big. It is a bit longer in the back even  with the pannier full hoop.I still like it. the only reason why I did not rate it 5 stars was because it arrived quite wrinkled.  So yes, I would buy it again."
4.0,"Great price. Pretty vibrant colors, but very cheaply made. I bought them to be worn at a wedding during the grand march. They worked great for that. Broke a few weeks later but they served their purpose."
4.0,I just got it today and it's pretty.  I will wear it in the cooler months.
4.0,Super short but I enjoy this robe immensely.
4.0,Looks like dog hair on garmet when I opened it.
4.0,Loved this top I always get so many compliments on it. The only thing is that it is much too short when tied to be worn without pants. And I'm 5 foot 2 lol.
4.0,"I just received this bracelet in the mail today.  I was very shocked when I took it out of the package. This actual bracelet is way better than the picture.  It is quality and fairly heavy.  My wife loved the looks also.  This is definitely a great buy so if any of guys are looking for a great bracelet to wear, you will definitely like the fine piece of workmanship and the way it looks.  I am really glad to own and wear it.  You guys better buy this before it goes away!"
4.0,"I am highly sensitive to metals and usually get a horrible rash of I wear anything other tha. Sterling silver or gold. I have been looking for sterling silver hoops for ages but they are usually flimsy and expensive. These earrings are a substantial weight, a flirty size and most importantly don't cause me to break out. The product itself is worth five stars, but I rated this four stars due to shipping delays.<br /><br />As a side note, if you need to get these earrings within a short period of time, I recommend that you upgrade to something other than standard shipping. It took two weeks to receive these earrings (a week behind the expected delivery date)."
4.0,The waist trainer fit just as expected! Comfortable enough to wear under your clothing if you want to wear it all day.
4.0,"I love wearing these. They shine, sparkle and get many compliments. I'm a sucker for sparkly things to the point of tacky, but I make no apologies that Elizabeth Taylor and Anna Nicole were fashion icons to me ;) People look at my husband as though he is some kind of millionaire....."
4.0,"Beautiful skirt, too small my coworker bought it from me"
4.0,I like it but it's a weird material almost like spandex and it makes it super hot. Also the strings come way too long so you'll have to cut them.
4.0,Very nice quality hat and looks great! The only drawback for me is that it seems rather large on me.
4.0,"Cute and stylish, Useful for flats."
4.0,"Beautiful tiger eye stones with gold and rose gold layers, characteristic of Silver Forest. They should have arrived on Jan 23, but arrived on Jan 24."
4.0,"I bought this pouch for my mom who has some mobility issues due to a stroke.  She really likes it for transporting her cell phone from place to place in the house.  With her phone case on, however, her phone barely fits into the bag - something I hadn't thought about!  She has an iPhone 5c."
4.0,"Its really chic and goes with a lot of things. It is kind of pointy so it will poke you, but I recommend it for the price."
4.0,"I love the feel of this dress, the length and sleeves are just right. The material is almost see-thru."
4.0,"Great quality Leather and hardware.  Midsize Purse with a simple design.  Lightweight, considering its Leather.  The interior is roomy with a zipper section and two pockets.  Comes with a full strap as well.  I use this purse as an everyday bag.  Only one con:  Does not have an exterior pocket.  With that being said, I have purchased three Bostonian purses and two wallets.  Bostanian has many styles and sizes available on Amazon.  I am surprised that the price is not a lot more!"
4.0,Using for normal time ID .
4.0,"The cat ginger snap is nice, but I didn’t feel it was as sharp in person as it looked online.<br />I am giving this item as part of a birthday gift."
4.0,Great! Just the material is all right
4.0,"I love these boots, the are perfect for a casual look, and look great inside your jeans or a legging. The mix between the leather and the suede is perfect, and the heal, not too high not too low. I have them in black and grey, and the grey one dont come with the suede."
4.0,Very soft and comfortable. I am 5ft 3 and they are not too long
4.0,"Not bad, it’s very thin but it seems to be made well, there weren’t any stray strings or tears. Most of the design is printed on, the sleeve cuffs and bottom band were made out of a thicker sweater type material which was nice, the pockets were real and deep enough to put my hands in, the zipper was decent and didn’t feel too flimsy. I got an XL and it fit me fine, I’m about 5 foot and it almost came down to my knees"
4.0,"Super cute & the adjustability is great. I knew I wouldn't be getting anything super high quality when I saw the price, but the rose gold color will rub off within a month or two, and one of my toe bean ""stones"" (I know they're not real stones) fell out upon dropping the ring on the floor. Still, it is a very cute accessory and it will be impossible for anyone to tell if the color has worn off until they bring it up to their eye. Just be careful with it!"
4.0,"It is very snug fitting around the head and the back part, the slouchy part, is not yet very slouchy.  I suspect it will as I wear it more.  It is very warm."
4.0,"These are too cute, I remember them from way back when snap bracelets were cool. I cannot honestly rate them because it's only the 15th of December, and it's a Christmas gift for my seven year old granddaughter. However, without a doubt, this old granny would wear them. I love the colors and the sequins. Knowing my granddaughter, she'll be totally distracted when wearing them to her second grade class. They'll probably secretly be passed around the classroom. Then, she and all her classmates will receive a conduct mark, and she'll send an email explaining the distraction created by these bracelets. Every student why participated in the ' bracelet testing' group will receive a conduct mark and parents will receive the dreaded teacher email in their in-boxes. My granddaughter will surely blame me. If this review has helped in your decision-making, please click the 'helpful' button. Thank you."
4.0,Very pretty. Will look really nice with my sister's dark hair.
4.0,This bag is pretty big and it works best as a travel bag and if you like to carry alot of junk. Its a pretty bag in terms of color and fabric. The only reason that kept me from givibg this bag 5 stars is because of the strap and the clips on it. I feel like the strap should be a bit more wider and thicker because of the bags size. Plus the strap you can clip on either the sides or diagonally but when you do it kind of feels like the weight isn't being distributed properly. Overall its good bag.
4.0,Nice glasses.  Like the look
4.0,"Fits okay, but would be better on a less curvy figure.  No good way to hang this sweater."
4.0,I've had it for about a year and it's still going strong. The one thing I don't like is how the silver part isn't aligned perfectly. It sticks out
4.0,This is super cute and is just as pictured.  It is on the short side so I will probably end up wearing a cami under it if it shrinks.  If you don't mind showing a little mid drift then this will be fine as is for you.  I love the shoulders.  I can forgive the shorter length because the shoulders and sleeves are so cute.  It is a nice medium weight with a soft feel. I like it.
4.0,Very good quality. I like the adjustable nose piece. My glasses don’t fog up as much.
4.0,"These brand laces are pretty cool. They are very nicely detailed and fit my converse almost perfectly. If you are looking to lace up high-tops though, I would get a longer set.<br /><br />The Good -<br />Nice colors, stiff/don't stretch (wont ruin the pattern), very shiny and nice gold endcaps. Medium width laces, thin material.<br /><br />The Bad-<br />The are slick and sometimes your knots come loose. Both my sets had the golden lace-caps fall off, which I super-glued back on."
4.0,It's nice but it runs a little small
4.0,Beautiful. Look real.
4.0,They were too big for my 7 month old but she is on the smaller side. She's still able to wear them because they're tight enough at the ankle they stay on. This way I'll get an extra years use out of them. Used them for the first time today and once we got onto the splash pad they didn't come off once (they did a few times before we got there. I like how thick the sole is. I don't have to worry about her getting hurt if she steps on something. They also have great traction.
4.0,"I’m not a fan of horns but I want to comfortably stretch from a 2 to a 0g. I put the pink pair in before taking a photo of the others, using a key for size reference. The quality of these are really nice especially for the low price but I’m really disappointed that my black pair (the ones I wanted to stretch with) came in all wonky..."
4.0,The cost of the product is too high for a couple of bungie cords and plastic balls. It's also annoying that I have to purchase a replacement it when I only need one item out of the entire kit.
4.0,"This is a beautiful robe. The fabric is silky and just as shown in the pictures. It is a single layer of fabric with no lining. The seams are strong with 4 threat serging (if you know sewing terms). All of the seams look well done. I do have some problems with this robe though. I weigh 230 pounds, and I'm a size 18. I bought this in a 2XL. It closes around my torso just fine, but it gapes below my thighs, so its not quite big enough, but it would work if I really needed it to. The biggest problem is that the loops for the sash and the inner ties are sewn at hip level instead of waist level. I don't know if every size is like this, or just the big sizes. Perhaps the designers think that the bigger you are, the lower your waist is. If I keep this robe, I would have to rip out the ties and the belt loops and reattach them at least 6 inches higher in order to be able to close the robe properly. I'm not sure if its worth it. If you're looking for a cheap, lightweight robe, and you don't care if its proportioned properly, then this robe might work for you. Or even if you're good with a sewing machine and can fix it yourself, then this might work. I think I'm just going to return this, as pretty as it is, and get something different."
4.0,"Sizing is a bit on the small side so be sure to go up at LEAST one size. Other than it not fitting... The materiel is really nice, fleece lined feature is nice as well, pockets and stow able hood is also really great to have."
4.0,"Comfortable, work well.  DO NOT WEAR IN SWIMMING POOL"
4.0,Nice quality and great tie!!
4.0,These were purchased to replace a pair we lost on vacation. Still awesome as ever. Four stars because the anti fog feature doesn't last long. Still these goggles are killer. Would buy them again.
4.0,Cute and seems to be decent quality for the price though it leaves a small rash around my neck. To be fair my skin is sensitive and the collar I have to wear to work also irritates the skin around my neck.
4.0,A little short for my fat head
4.0,I ordered a M as my boobs are rather large and Amazon suggested a sm/med. it fit my skinny ma link twelve year old daughter. I’m disappointed because I love the shirt but O fear it won’t come in my size. Beware it is extremely small. I’m 5’2 about 145lbs. I am by no means fat. It didn’t even come together across my hips.
4.0,"Fits well. The hood slides around and comes to the front a lot, but if its buggy on the trail it’s nice to have to keep the gnats and flies off."
4.0,"I'm a big fan of closing that is made of 100% cotton, so I was happy to have this option for my son. It fit him well, the color is great. If it were slightly cheaper, say 3 or 4 more dollars less, I would buy a number of these. Still even at this price it is a pretty good buy. The long sleeves are great for transitional seasons."
4.0,"Far exceeded my expectations. Quality frame, good lenses, light weight."
4.0,Love it...Very great product.
4.0,My 12 year old son loves amd uses this cool mask. 😎
4.0,It is great looking but the odor of latex is bad. Just be sure to order well in advance (2 weeks) to allow it time to air out. I received it 4 days early and the latex smell was still strong despite airing 3 days and then soaking all night before I wore it.  Couldn't keep it on for more than a minute or two.
4.0,"The goggles fit good, the only thing that would be better if it would cover your nose."
4.0,This well-detailed dress fits and flatters as expected!
4.0,Comfortable and nice material
4.0,"This band is exactly what I was looking for. It’s lightweight, breathable, and doesn’t make my wrist sweat like the band my Fitbit Alta originally came with.<br /><br />The band also stays on very well. It clasps with Velcro and one of the ends that connects it to the Fitbit is free floating so it’s adjustable. Total length is almost exactly 9”, with the Velcro taking up about 2” of that.<br /><br />I like that I can wash it under the faucet with soap and water, and that it air drys relatively quick.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is with the color. I ordered ‘seashell’ which is a grayish color with white plastic ends. For some reason I feel like it just looks dirty all the time. It could be because the ends are white. Regardless, I wish I had ordered a different color."
4.0,"I'm normally a small but after reading the reviews I ordered a medium. Happy that I did so because it fits me just perfect. However, even with slight movement the Velcro in the back comes undone. Had to put in bobby pins halfway through the day and going to be adding buttons long-term. Same story with the belt they included. Okay for a seasonal outfit but have to add alterations to make it work.."
4.0,Love everything about it just a little tight for me..
4.0,"The size did fit just right, but it wasn't as long and baggy as it appears in the picture. It is a pretty gray cardigan though, and I do still wear it."
4.0,Cute pendant has a little weight but over all a nice piece my daughter just ardors it .
4.0,"I usually wear a large sized shirt and this shirt fits a little snug in the belly area.  Not bad, I usually tuck it in though.  It has held up well to washed & the color is just like the picture."
4.0,It's very comfortable it's a lil thick but even that's ok and u can even size down! I  will order one more soon
4.0,"The pendant itself is 1 3/4 inches in diameter, is brass in coloring, and has Ubi Workshop stamped on the back.. It appears to be made of die cast metal (the same as old Hot Wheels toy cars) and is very light weight. The clasp from pendant to cord is a little cheap, it looks  to be maybe a piece of aluminum. The cord is a molded plastic designed to look like braided cording. The cord clasp is typical costume jewelry style. I wouldn't put much faith in the durability of the clasps or plastic cord and if I were to plan on wearing it, I'd replace them with a strip of leather cording. The overall look of the piece is great. The pendant really stands out and would be good to use as a cosplay costume piece. I got it for my Assassin's Creed collection so won't be wearing it. Nonetheless, for four dollars, it's totally worth it and is molded even better than I expected."
4.0,This is a cute dress. But is actually shorter than the picture. I am returning it because it is too short for me.  I would recommend that you go up a size or two for those dress.  It is designed to cling.  The dress is very well-made and the lace is sturdy.
4.0,Loved this dress! I loved the fact that it was comfortable and had pockets. However be careful of your undergarment selection because it’s a little see through
4.0,"Gave as a gift and have not heard that it does not work, so assume all was good.  It is very stylish and pretty"
4.0,"The picture of the model wearing this kimono is accurate.  It's cute and fits like a sack, everywhere except at the waist.  The quality is good for the price point.  The colors are subdued and it looks good to wear on the beach.  This cover-up is definitely something to only wear by the pool or beach."
4.0,"I live in Hawaii, so I am very sensitive to the cold. I live in a chillier part of the Island, so this hoodie is perfect. It keeps me warm in the low 60s. The part that I didn't like is that the inside looks different than the picture. It's actually white inside and leaves a lot of lint on dark clothing despite repeated washings. I plan on ordering another one and hope it looks like the picture. I am 5'4"" 127lbs. I ordered a large but could fit a medium easy."
4.0,These look great but are way too big for my small face.
4.0,"Bought them for the wife. Sadly now they go to the kid. They are unisex, but about 16 inches long. Barely goes from my wrist to my elbow."
4.0,Very pretty but a bit flimsy and fake looking. You get what you pay for though.
4.0,The size is fine but they are pretty narrow. They won't fit well if you have wide feet. Other than that they are cute and my daughter loved them.
4.0,"Overall an okay product, but the title is misleading. I thought I was getting a cozy sweatshirt, but it's a long sleeve shirt with a hood."
4.0,"Got these for my son, he loves them."
4.0,"This charm is very cute. It looks exaclty like what you would expect it to. The only thing is that the Oriole is only on one side of the charm. Other than that, it is perfect. Also, it is so much cheaper than getting it through Pandora."
4.0,Great for dresses etc. Adds glamour and fits really well for a variety of waist sizes. I shared mine with my friends and they all loved it. I wouldnt wear it on pants as it just scrunches up on them.
4.0,Color is off looks more like gray tye dye than black. Lighter in color than in the picture.
4.0,Very lively made! Quick service and great price.
4.0,"NICE! Surprised by these Silver Hoop earrings, I really like that there isn't a stem sticking out the back. They &#34;click&#34; closed, and are sturdy."
4.0,This is a really nice piece of jewelry but the gold is a little too yellow to be really pretty.
4.0,"I love these shades the gold color  is not as bright as in the photo it's more of a dull gold look ,but I like that I don't have to explain they are not really gold ."
4.0,I love these cute fruit bicycle pajamas. My 14 month old wears them and they fit well (not sure how well they will fit at 18 months). Bright colors; perfect for a boy or a girl. Makes me crave  Fruit Stripes Gum everytime he wears them. 😊
4.0,"Nice length chain and antiqued finish. o one would mistake it for a real gem, but I get compliments when I wear it."
4.0,"The watch arrived promptly and was in working order; however, I didn't really like the face of the watch.  I'm keeping it because the shipping was very expensive, there's a 15% restocking fee, and I'd have to pay return shipping.  Those costs almost total the price of the watch.  For that reason, I won't order except directly from Amazon in the future.  That way I'll get free shipping and no restocking fee."
4.0,this made for a nice x-mas party shirt.  a bit thin though
4.0,These are cute.  They are a bit thinner than expected.  Great for wearing with shoes and for warmer climates.  Well made and stay on my daughters feet.  Will buy again for summer use.
4.0,Love the color and style. I ordered up because of the previous review. I think I could have ordered my size which is a medium. I ordered a large but it still fits as expected and comfortable.
4.0,Fit well and soft fabric. But the picture/words aren’t as brightly colored as the picture. Looks a tad bit faded but my daughter loves it.
4.0,The print on this sundress is really pretty just like the picture. It is a little long on me but I'm 5'5 so it would fit well on taller women. I purchased to wear as a swimsuit coverup while on vacation and it will work perfectly. The material is nice and soft and after washing it once still looks great without fading or pilling.
4.0,Works very well. Actually too well for me. I can't scan my badge at work without taking it out of the wallet and moving the wallet away. We will see how it holds up over the years.
4.0,Item wa a little too big but it was everything I expected. Material was perfect  and not cheap looking.  I would purchase again.
4.0,Great quality and color... it is hard to beat a Chatham emerald unless you go for a natural stone at many times the price.  It is petite and the white gold mounting is secure and classic in style.  It came shipped in an envelope with the origin and specifications printed on it.  Genuine Chatham at a very reasonable price.
4.0,"I have black and blue in this top. Nice material that is not cheap like rayon. My only complaint is that the sleeves are too long on me, but I have short arms. I just roll them up."
4.0,"It arrived after the event however, it was just the right size for my nine year old."
4.0,"It is a really nice shirt however, I only gave it 4 stars because it was too short for my waste. What I mean by that is that I am 5'5 209lbs and because I am taller with a broader back, its not as long at the waste. It fits everywhere else. The length of the arms a perfect and the size  I got was perfect which was a 14. If it was only made with a little bit more material so it came longer to my hips,  it  would have been  perfect!"
4.0,"not sure if he needed the medium or large so i bought both. the medium is too snug.. the large fits, but isn't snug. i am not sure how much pressure he is supposed to feel. his 2nd time trying the medium he said it was more comfortable.. at first he said it felt like it was squeezing his chest. he hasn't worn it long enough for me to gauge whether it helps his behavior. he seems to like it now though."
4.0,"Fit a little big, but shrunk a bit in the wash. Very soft, but tag bugs me. Cut it out, but little bit in the seam still bugs me. ( I have autism and sensory issues and really hate tags in shirts)"
4.0,"I usually wear a large but I ordered the XL just to be sure it fit, and it fit perfect! Very cute shirt.. Suggestion:order size up bc it runs a little small.."
4.0,This was not an x-large as fitted to tight had to give item away.
4.0,"Very nice shirt. I loved it, the teenager not so much. Sad that this cannot be returned. I didn't realize anything on Amazon couldn't be. So now I'm left with a shirt that I'm not sure what to do with. I asked why he didn't like and he just stated that it was ugly."
4.0,"Super cute, super comfy, apt he fabric is little on the thin side so I probably will only wear it at home. I worry about the knit catching and snagging easily, so I will have to be careful, which is a bit annoying."
4.0,"Although the material is obviously cheap, it's still looks cute. Very flattering on curvy gals."
4.0,"The earrings were a bit longer than I expected, but the colors were just what I wanted and they appear to be well made. One of them curls slightly, but is barely noticeable and overall, I am happy with my purchase. I was a bit concerned that they were packaged in a small plastic bag, not a box, and were simply loose in a bigger box that held other items that I had ordered. When they arrived, I was concerned that they could have been damaged, but they appear to be OK."
4.0,"It’s cute, it looks cheaper in person than the picture. Comfortable, and true to size though."
4.0,It's bulky I admit but can't help to love this retro look
4.0,"Love this hat, comfortable and cute. Great for hot days here in Florida."
4.0,These are good shorts!<br />Would buy again. I like the loose fit but also still cute. Higher waisted. And they make me look good!
4.0,Cute. Wish they were a bit longer.
4.0,"These are great value for the price. They do have some downsides, like a short battery life. My son wears 4 or so hours and then we have to recharge them. They also had some stuffing coming out of the tongue of the shoe, and the cords keep slipping into the hole in the shoe, meaning that we need to fish for them to push the button. Overall though, for the price, they are great. He gets compliments on them wherever he goes and the lights are very bright!"
4.0,"A little long which was a surprise since I am 5'8&#34;, but fine if you wear heels."
4.0,I like the dress but must have it hemmed!
4.0,very nice but the fit is small
4.0,Cute but it has no elastic or anything in it so it slips up a lot
4.0,"Beautiful in simplicity and design, I love the blue."
4.0,This is the second color that I have bought in this style. It is so comfortable and gets lots of compliments. Great price too.
4.0,"I'm very slim, and the shirt is very fitted. After I eat, I can feel the buttons tug a bit. Looks great. Feels great."
4.0,"Exactly as pictured. I didn't give it 5 stars because I haven't yet washed it, so I don't know how it will hold up. It is short."
4.0,Glad I purchased these masks. They feel secure and mostly comfortable.
4.0,I really like this style tunic from Lock n Love.  It would be a 5 star if they had more colors. There's no black?
4.0,"I really love this top!! Get a size up for sure! I typically wear a large and ordered an extra large and fits great with a bit of room. The sleeves are not the same material as the top, but still super cute! Love it! Can wear in the fall with a jean jacket and leggings and boots! My measurements for reference are 5'5, 130, 36D."
4.0,"This is cute & small. I wasn't sure this would fit, but luckily my wrist is small. The cage that holds the fit bit is magnetic. So far it hasn't come loose. This is a great price considering the name brand bangle costs $100."
4.0,I expected the material to be thicker but other than that it's cute.
4.0,"This bag is great! It’s the right size for almost anything. Change of clothes, some books, a water bottle - all fits with no problem. Tons of pockets to put stuff in, the rain cover fits over it snug so nothing get wet, and with the chest and waist straps you don’t feel the weight nearly as much."
4.0,"So cozy. Colors are awesome. Well constructed. My only criticism, which is worth the one star, the ""s"" is starting to come up, after a single wash and dry, done according to label instructions. I'm going to try some reliable fabric glue, since I've had it too long to exchange it. Plus, the hoodie is really good quality and the exact team I represent! #BearDown"
4.0,very nice and economical for kitchen use.
4.0,"I am 5f 4.5n, Bust 35.25, Waist 27in,  133lbs, I ordered both a 12 & a 10. I kept the size 10 and I still had room to wear a bulky sweater underneath it. It is not very breathable, but because of that it keeps you pretty warm. I bought this as it was rated one of the top jackets on the outdoor research website. However, I like the fit, style, and breathability of my Arcteryx Atom jacket more."
4.0,The item itself was fine- arrived a day late... needed  it for a Christmas Denim Party. Returned item.
4.0,Didn't know how small my wrist were until tried this band for watch. cute band but wish they made smaller
4.0,Super cute and light weight dress. Thin material but not too bad. Runs really big. I normally wear a 2 and got an XS
4.0,"Purchased these for a trip to Disney World and got a lot of compliments on the patterns. They are super cute and the print is very vibrant, even after several washings. It's a nice mask to wear daily and I was able to breath during our trip as the fabric is not too thick even with the filter.<br /><br />The only things I didn't like are - 1) the mask is a little big. I have an average size head and had to adjust the heck out of the masks to get them to be form fitted without gaps. Once I did, though, they were very comfortable and protective. 2) The nose wire is thin. I wear glasses so I had to adjust throughout the day a few times as the bend would loosen. This isn't a huge problem but I know it's best not to have to touch the mask, so ??<br /><br />Overall, satisfied and I would purchase from this company again."
4.0,"These socks feel really good, I love the thin feeling for summer time with my converse low shoes ! The work perfect with those! The only thing I did not realize was they need to air dry and no tumble drying, that seems odd to me since I’ve never NOT been able to dry socks! So pretty sure I will forget this so fingers crossed they don’t tear up !"
4.0,Ordered these for my husband.  Exactly as described.  Received on time.  Would order again.
4.0,I weigh 235 and my height is 5’11 the large was to small gonna try the XL
4.0,Very comfortable and you even forget you have it on!
4.0,My husband loves the way I look in this suit. It is very well made and will last years. I'm 5'3&#34; - 165 lbs and the 46 (10/12) fits mostly great. The circumference of the suit is perfect but the length was made for someone with a longer body. I have to tie the neck strap tightly to keep my chest from being over exposed. I think the back strap needs repositioned. It seems to be too low.<br /><br />I think I may make a couple of adjustments to it and keep it because it is so well made and the skirt cover just enough to be sexy with out showing my whole rear end.
4.0,It looks very nice as an extra accessory to your outfit!
4.0,"This has become my go-to top.  It goes over everything (including long tunics) and is very flattering.<br />The material will wear quickly.  It starts to fuzz after 1-2 washings (gentle cycle, hang to dry).  And, it attracts lint.<br />At the same time, it's so lightweight you can put it in your purse for those over-air conditioned restaurants.  It's perfect for plane travel.<br />Sleeves fit more snugly than they should to be true to size."
4.0,"I expected the pleats to be more pronounced than it actually is. The other customer pictures are just as expected and what they look like in actuality. I got the XL because I'm a bit big and have a bit more visceral fat. It fits just above my knee. It feels lose, but it doesn't slide like I expected. I feel like the looseness is due to the material. It is pretty thin, but not terrible. It reminds me of similar material (dress skirts, business skirts etc...). It looks flattering and I've always had reservations about skirts. It holds wrinkles very well, unfortunately, but I think it will lose them as well. I plan on wearing this to the Harry Potter midnight release, so we'll see how it actually holds up!"
4.0,"For this price, the quality could be better. But the kids love Fortnite so it made a good bday gift."
4.0,Bought as a gift. Too expensive for my taste and very stiff but she likes it so i guess its a hit 🤷🏻‍♂️
4.0,Works well. Just as described.
4.0,"I bought the white pair. Currently 150 lbs, 5’7”. Wear a 28” pant. A small was just a little too tight. This fabric is see through so I want a looser fit."
4.0,"Gloves are well-made, however, the sizing runs small so XL is a very tight fit."
4.0,It us very pretty  easy to change bands
4.0,Well built and comfortable...the size chart seems off and ran larger than my normal as size.
4.0,Fit as expected. Perfect to wear in gym shower.
4.0,"Nice watch overall, especially for the price. The face is rather large, too large for the delicate straps. Disadvantage of buying online. Otherwise, it's okay."
4.0,Quality is good for price point and I appreciate that they came with a blue light and tester card to show they work!!
4.0,"I have only had this item for about a month, way to soon to honestly rate."
4.0,I absolutely love it im 330 n it fits great omg ty ty ty
4.0,"This lens is not exactly the same as the one that came with the Bolles I bought from a national retailer in 1996. It is ~3/16"" taller than the original lens and the glasses won't fit in the Bolle case anymore. It works nicely with the Bolle frame and nose piece. I suppose you could have it tested for UV protection at an optical store if you wanted to. I was happy to find a replacement lens at all and the price is reasonable."
4.0,Cute dress but feel like it's made out of canvas for a tent.
4.0,"Cord hole defective, can't put a cord through. Sealed off... 😑"
4.0,wear carefully
4.0,"The memory wire in it makes the brim look wonky. I made a small slit, removed the memory wire and replaced it with some craft wire so<br />we could shape how we wanted it. Other than that, it is a beautiful hat and looked nice on my daughter. Got it in purple, it was beautiful."
4.0,Good  quality and good price.
4.0,very  comfortable without the sharp edges my original metal band had. It should have more adjustment notches since even at the tightest  setting it is a bit loose. (the largest setting would probably just right for bigfoot.
4.0,"More pantyhose fabric than I would have liked, but fit ok and no show, haven’t ripped"
4.0,"Great sun prtotection, reading function and style. The only shortcoming is that the ear holder screws become loose quickly"
4.0,Good buy. Ordered this as one of my birthday outfits Will update with picture soon.
4.0,Looks good! Not as see through as I thought it would be! I think it’s just my body that’s the issue not the fit lol
4.0,"These sunglasses are a bit larger than they appear on the site, so be forewarned if you're looking for a more traditional John Lennon sort of style. I've found that I like the over-large size quite well and I've actually received a few compliments on them. Despite the coloring, the lenses provide a standard grey sort of shading, but they function well at keeping the glare/brightness to a comfortable level."
4.0,Quality was good enough for the one time use for Halloween!  would but again.
4.0,"cozy, but not too hot for summer wear."
4.0,I ordered a size 16 and it fit perfectly.  I tuck the drawstrings inside pants because I wear my polos outside of pants.  The fabric is heavier for fall/winter/spring.  Too heavy for hot Louisiana weather.  Loved the color.
4.0,"First of all, it is a lovely dress, unless you have any bust at all. It seems well made, and the color is nice. However, as you can tell from the photo, not for anyone with a full bust! I wear a 40C, which I don’t think is ginormous, but I sure look ginormous in this! I would not wear this in public. It is a shame, because it is very cute. Maybe I was dreaming when I ordered it! I returned it, but wanted you ladies with a full bust to see what it looks like on. Very sad."
4.0,real nice product for a nice price.shipping was good no complaints on anything would buy again
4.0,"I like the material, the length is good...I should have ordered a larger size....however, that is my fault not the makers....All in all a nice pair of trousers for any occasion."
4.0,"I ordered an XL and it fits just right. I am 5'3&#34;, 138-140lbs (depending on the day haha), my waist is 33&#34;, bust is 36C (in Victoria Secret) and shoulders are 16&#34;. The XL had a little extra room in my shoulders as well as my mid section but my bust fit almost a little snug.....not too tight but right how it should be I think....so if you are larger than a 36C then you might be in trouble. I like the material it's quality is not bad, the workmanship is also very good but the scarf is so so....looks a little cheap. Sadly I was not impressed with how it was packaged...it looked like someone just shoved it in the bag and didn't even bother to fold it nicely so now it's very wrinkled and the pleats in the skirt are not straight (due to being just waded up and not properly folded) so I have to take it to the dry cleaners to figure out how to get all the pleats straight as well as get the wrinkles out (since it says &#34;no hot iron&#34;.) Pretty much the way it was packaged and/or stored is my only complaint and that is why I give it 4 stars...otherwise the quality and the look is awesome!!"
4.0,Nice just pricey.
4.0,"If you're looking for a cute some what flowy dress to go with your curves this is not it, but it's very cute and light to wear.  In 100+ degrees it's worth it."
4.0,"Nice flowy dress, true to size 👌🏽"
4.0,Not quite wide enough for my head
4.0,My son really likes this to wear with his uniform.  Can't beat this necklace for the price.  I recommend it!
4.0,"After a year of carrying my cards and checkbook separately, both in rubber bands, I purchase this wallet in navy blue and I am not disappointed! It fits all of my cards, check register, checks and pen. With that being said, with my register, checks and cards in their place, i chose not to double up any cards in the same slot since it made the wallet bulkier. Also, I feel as if a light colored one would get dirty faster than a dark colored one.<br />I recommend this product!"
4.0,"These are thin but comfortable. Can't really wear them when it's cold out unless you plan on doubling up or wear those fluffy fuzzy socks over them. I like having a variety of socks so I don't mind them- not the best, not the worst."
4.0,"I got loads of compliments on this dress! It's cute fabric, great fit, and good fit and make. I only gave 4 stars because the fabric is cheap...but it's not an expensive item. It's completely synthetic...like I fell like it would melt if I ironed it. But if you can get past that, its cute!"
4.0,Looks cheapy
4.0,kids sizes! not adult
4.0,hurt my daughters feet after a while but she likes them.
4.0,I like the make and model and it was very well made
4.0,"Dress is beautiful but just a little tight across tummy . Good length and fit every where else. Too low in back for foundation garment I am planning to wear. My fault, not the dress's."
4.0,Comfortable but looks like you are just wearing an oversized stretched out t shirt.  The material is cheap tshirt material.  But that is what is advertised as.  It looks better on the woman in the advertisement than it does on me.  I do like the pockets.  It is very wearable for a very casual day.
4.0,It's very cheap and really a good deal and a nice watch for the price that I paid.
4.0,These are tiny. Very flimsy as well.  Overall they worked great but definitely throw aways.
4.0,It works great with my Nintendo switch game .
4.0,Super soft love it kid wears it soon the time bit big and I ordered his usual size but he has room to grow
4.0,Love it. I used for my work bag
4.0,Cute and the quality is amazing. I keep getting a compliments because of this everywhere I go in my hospital. Some of my co-worker bought one for themselves ❤️
4.0,It was a little to drab so I had to add sparkle. I’m very crafty so it has what it needs.
4.0,Too small but look nice
4.0,Ordered it for a bachelorette party in Vegas. Shorter than expected but still covers what it is supposed to cover.
4.0,"For the price, you can't beat the watch. I've had it for over a year and it works well.  The finish has not deteriorated.<br />The bezel did get scratched, which could have been prevented with a more durable material."
4.0,this came in a cute little box. At first I was disappointed that my iPhone 6+ didn't fit in the middle pocket. However it slid nicely into the side pocket. The middle zipper pocket is perfect for cash and change. All my credit cards and license all fit in the card slots. This is a wallet I will use often.
4.0,I love these crystals but the chain choice is odd. I re did all the chains and switched them to a more dainty chain. Love them.
4.0,good cleaning shoe cloth
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress, I got the Navy Blue and absolutely love it. The only complaint that I have is that the top (bust area) is a little tight. I typically buy my clothes a size large but bought this dress in an extra large and I'm glad I did"
4.0,Nice colors.<br />Thought bags would be bigger .
4.0,"The plastic thing at the end of the cords that tighten the hood came off immediately, no way to put back on.  Very lightweight."
4.0,"The fact that they are sized a bit small.  I regularly where a XL but the XL I received was too small.  So if you are an XL make sure you order an XXL, etc."
4.0,It feels warm and soft but an extra foot longer would be better.  Also the opening in the front does not make sense as it makes me feel cold.
4.0,Love this top. It very pretty. I usually wear an xl but this top is small for someone who’s busty like me so I’ll exchange for a size up and hope it works out
4.0,Nice heavy duty strap. Good leather. I like the light gray with black edge fade
4.0,"True color, fit perfectly, only complaint is there are no elastic loops on the inside so dress must either be folded or hung by lace sleeves which could stretch the fabric. Would have given 5 stars but for that detail."
4.0,"It's a little short, but otherwise cute."
4.0,I bought this for bow hunting.  It is build well and fit very comfortable.  The only draw back that  I can see is that I wish it open foward and not towards the rear. Other than that a solid product.
4.0,I would suggest ordering a size bigger than you usually wear. I am giving it four stars for this reason.
4.0,Works well for hanging from a backpack.
4.0,"This cropped shirt is as pictured, but just keep in mind that it is a little high, so if you have large breasts or a wide torso, it may ride up more than desired. It is comfortable and as pictured and not transparent black."
4.0,Sleeves are a smidgen short but still gonna rock it.
4.0,"Sturdy cap.  The material is very cool.<br />Design-wise, it has a bit of trendy stylishness, but<br />not up to brunch in the city.  It is excellent for<br />yard chores."
4.0,The gloves didn't keep my hands that warm.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:5b9a9bc1e9e3abdfee6163fe2b5c04ab]] I felt so comfortable and cute as hell. The orange was so vibrant and all eyes were glued to this fit. Only thing is that the pants were really long and I’m 5’7. Other than that definitely a great buy.
4.0,"This is a good looking peice of jewelry, and it look great on my daughter's ankle."
4.0,"Bought for my preteen, she can’t stop talking about how comfortable and soft it is and how cute the back of it is. She wants it in more colors and prints now."
4.0,"Samjok o , I love this image of truth , please make in Silver , and in Gold , Thank You Korean trends !"
4.0,nice but hard to snap closed.
4.0,"I was thinking the sizing would be a more straight fit as the sizing is unisex. However, it is more form fitting - i suggest going up a size if you want a looser fit"
4.0,"Everything it is great, but the hood just slipped down. Too small.  :/"
4.0,"For great going by the sizing guide. The red had adjustable straps which was nice. Looks pretty cute on too with a flowy, loose, twirly kind of flair to it. material is like a chiffon with a lining of cheap poly most likely, static cling but feels soft enough. However...if you said this was lingerie I would believe you. My husband loves it but he's bias towards it ;) Debating if I should keep it or not because it is actually flattering but not sure if it's the look I need right now."
4.0,Nice bag.  Good pocket size.  Bought 2 of them.  Only flaw (kinda major).  The second zipper broke on both them after only 1 trip.  Both garment bags were lightly packed.  2 suits in each.
4.0,"It’s beautiful but too small, for me. I didn’t search the description well enough. I cannot find a length listed in the description"
4.0,Obtuve mi producto
4.0,"Stretchy, a little too big, but works"
4.0,Looks like it should have cost more- absolutely adorable charm. Only drawback so far is the chain tarnished in the first few wearings. Hopefully the owl will hold up quite a bit longer.
4.0,This is a nice knitted set that keeps you toasty during chilly weather. It’s soft and comfortable to wear but not in freezing conditions.
4.0,I love the hat it's has  cool mesh so it breaths and dosent let your head sweat up under neath and it has my favorite CNC brand on it the only  problem is that its a bit snug and its the M/L size  if only there was a L/XL size if there is I couldn't find it here on amazon
4.0,Nice abaya to tight in arms but comfy material. Too short for my tastes above the ankle
4.0,"This is a very attractive watch! I received the watch and was very excited to check it out. The first thing that I noticed was how beautiful the watch looks. It is very fashionable and it appears to be well constructed. Aside from the eye appea, the face is large and easy to read and the window for the date is large enough that its also easy to see.<br />As for functionality, the movement is butter smooth and seems very accurate. Setting the proper time and date was very easy.<br />The watch band was too large but all watches come with a large size band so its quite normal, for me anyway, to have some links removed for a better fit. I absolutely love that this watch came with a simple tool so that I could remove the links. I was able to wear the watch immediately rather than wait for a jeweler. Huge plus in my book.<br />Finally for the review rating. I would have given the watch a five but I find the watch band to be very noisy. It clunks and rattles terribly. I do worry how well it will hold up. At the price point of this watch the lower value of the band is a fairly minor issue. I will revisit this review after I wear the watch awhile."
4.0,Nice hat.  Good price.
4.0,"Nice to lounge in or run quick errands in. Very cute set, but it's a bit short in the legs."
4.0,"Absolutly love this sweatshirt. Im 5'4"" 135lbs and a medium is perfect as I like to wear my sweatshirts a little baggy. I gave it 4 stars only because the weird lining it came with but I cut it out."
4.0,"Extremely tight on my stomach, but I have until August to slim down. Very pretty"
4.0,"Quality of the product was Genuine, the price reasonable for a Ralph Lauren item. It was actually gift for my wife."
4.0,vary nice and the grips are nice
4.0,This shirt is a lot of fun to wear and very comfortable and looks great.  The only objection I have to this is the thin fabric  which makes it comfortable and fun looking also created a fabric string after just one trip though the laundry.
4.0,Fits good except at the top area… arms n chest … it’s wearable just alil tight<br />Super cute 🥰
4.0,"It’s a cheap suit, so I didn’t expect too much. However the fabric and seams are all holding up after many days swimming and many washes. It’s not lined and the size proportion are off a bit. But for my 5 year old to use in our own pool, it works just perfect!"
4.0,"I have tiny hands so this bracelet was far too big for me, but it's still stylish"
4.0,These fit as expected and look like photo shown. Good for the price
4.0,"Fit true to size for an American extra large. Overall it is flattering and fits nicely on my body type. That said, it doesn't flare from the waistline as much as you would expect from an A-line cut. It hugs the midde of the torso further down. This worked out fine for me, but if you were buying this cut specifically to conceal a rounder midsection this probaby would not work. Ordering a size up to accomplish this wouldn't work either, because it's pretty generous in the chest/underarm area."
4.0,"Good hat for the price.  Very satisfied, except for packaging.  Box was too small.  Hat was crushed in order to make it fit the box."
4.0,"This jumpsuit is beautiful! Unfortunately, I have to return it because I have wide hips. I ordered the medium and it would have fit but the waist has a tight band that I couldn't even fit past my thighs. If you have bigger hips it will not go on. Super sad cause the material is super nice and it is very cute! Just needs a zipper or maybe a stretchier waistband​."
4.0,"I think these earrings are very pretty and look very nice on.  Very light and feel light when wearing them.  They actually do look better in person than in the picture.  You could wear these to work or out to dinner since they are pearls.  Pearls are classic.<br /><br />My only concern is that it put them on, you need to make 100% sure these are pinched tight through the hole.  I thought I had pinched it tight enough but it fell off my ear twice.  So be very very very careful to make sure it’s good before you head out because it might fall off."
4.0,"So far, I’ve just tried them on. I really like the COLOR and the depth of the pockets."
4.0,Product was enjoyed by kids
4.0,I noticed as I wore these (I ordered 5) the padding inside the cup should be lower... it sort of defeats the purpose of a lifting bra if it is pulling the breast down to fill the space beneath the padding. Otherwise I like the style of it. I am going to have to sew something into these so they have the sort of lift I was after.
4.0,"I purchased this Sak handbag for its large size.  It works well, but I was not happy with the straps that came with it.  The crossbody strap is a cheap plastic, so I took it off and put on a colorful camera strap and now it looks great.  The shorter braided strap looks nice, but is too short for my liking.  I only paid 39.00 for the bag, so am happy with the price."
4.0,It was supposed to have kiss me on the inside well i look on the inside of it no kiss me besides that I like it
4.0,Great waders for the price!! Only have taken them out 2 times but have hiked to fishing spots and been in rivers no problem!
4.0,The bar was so pretty ... didn't realize how frail the chain was
4.0,"(Wife writing) a little tight, definitely size up unless you're looking for compression. Color is as shown. Feels comfortable even if more compressing than expected."
4.0,It has a nice fit and has good quality fabric but there was a lot of loose strings. Overall it was a very nice product!
4.0,It fit as expected and was cute but it's a good thing it didn't need to last more than a few hours because the snap buttons fell off.
4.0,Great tunic. Covers the rear well so you can wear with leggings.
4.0,"Perfect size and holds a lot of cards, zipper sticks a little so 4 stars instead of 5"
4.0,Runs very small and not much give in the fabric. (I dont need a lot of support so I prefer comfort over stability)  constructed well just not comfortable to me.
4.0,I purchased this for my brothers Nook HD 7 and it holds the device well. He likes how it this case securely holds his Nook in one hand freeing up the other.
4.0,"Love it! Perfect color, it is small... But that is what I wanted. Ordered another for Christmas gift!!!!"
4.0,"I've gotten this for a dear friend<br />Holds up well , a great price, also very nice looking on. Very pretty and affordable !<br />But do keep it this out of your shower room or out of areas of high humidity or something his turns quickly - worth the investment"
4.0,"Waist elastic somewhat tight, otherwise perfect."
4.0,"thin, flexible, and durable wedding ring ! i got this ring, in black, for my husband. he hates that while hunting or working on the car that he has to take his ring off, he normally wears a ceramic ring. the ring is thinner than i expected it to be, but it doesn't seem to be flimsy. the black isnt shiny, so it doesnt look like a piece of plastic. he normally wears a 10.5, but this ring only comes in whole sizes, not half. we decided to go with the 11, and its a perfect fit. so if you are looking to purchase, but wear a half size, i would recommend going up, not down. i received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Cute but I received the wrong size
4.0,"These are really beautiful earrings, however they were not as translucent as the picture shows. They are well designed, and the color is beautiful no matter what light shows through. If sunlight happens to be behind you, the green is quite luminous, like in the picture. Green onyx is generally opaque unless it is a very thin piece. I'd rather have these sturdy earrings than something that might be prone to break. I have gauged ears and wear plugs, but I can still wear hook earrings. I love the way these look paired with my other ear jewelry. The bail around the stone is S925, meaning that it's a little more strong than regular 925 sterling. This does not take anything away from the earrings. They hang beautifully, and I slept with them in too and had no problems with comfort. There is one picture below where I'm holding a light almost directly underneath, only then do you see the luminous green color. I did receive these earrings at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased, honest review."
4.0,"This skirt is very pretty and the fabric is good quality for a reasonable price; unfortunately it was not the size I needed for my daughter since the length was too big for what we needed, other wise I would have kept it."
4.0,"Good fit, very cute"
4.0,It's nice at least received it
4.0,Love it. Cute outfit
4.0,"I was wearing this when a friend came over, and he instantly noticed and commented that he liked it. It's a simple necklace with a lobster clasp. My ball has a lot of ""clouds"" in it, but what I don't like is where the clouds contact the inside of the sphere. The touch points look like little bits of bright white paper stuck against the plastic. While I do like this necklace, I think it's more appropriate for younger women. I think a young teen would love it because it's so different. The length is also adjustable, because the manufacturer has added a 2"" length of chain with larger loops in which which you hook the lobster clasp."
4.0,The ring and the bone are of high quality but the dog charm broke off after a short period of time. I've used the ring/bone daily for over two years and there are just some minor pock-marks on the bone now - it's still structurally sound.
4.0,Happy looks great! Good quality.
4.0,The cart always pulls to the right.  i have adjusted the front wheel to the max to try and correct and the cart still pulls right.<br />MFG wants me to alter the frame by torquing the major components without a fixture to control the adjustment.  I'm not going to do that.<br />Would suggest you test the tracking of the cart in the store before you spend your money.
4.0,looks nice.
4.0,"These are more like a man's foot width than a woman's.  Good for sneakers or work boots,  but not a woman's average shoe,"
4.0,Good basic glasses. Frames could be somewhat stronger.
4.0,"Fit was as expected, maybe a tad on the bigger side. Colors are much more vibrant in person, and makes the shirt very eye catching. the flowy bottom is flattering and concealing. if you are large busted, this may not fit correctly though. my only complaint is I wish the seam under the bust was a bit tighter or had a little elastic to it. it's a little too large for me so it doesn't emphasize my waist as much as it could, so I do wonder if maybe I should have gone down a size"
4.0,"Feels sexy at the gym, kindof weird neck, smaller than expected but perfect for the gym. Not something I’d personally wear out casually as a 27 year old."
4.0,truly hugs your curves! I love it
4.0,"i do like this dress for 1 reason 1 reason only, the length. i’m 6’1” and i’ve never found any maxi dress that is this long. i wish it came in solid colors.<br />update: i was able to get ahold of a solid color dress in my size. sadly it was a full 6” shorter then the prints i previously bought"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:1b83f6b1c047ec5b4e2c12625c66c2]] The glasses look nice overall and are indeed polarized. I was almost in love till I cleaned them for the first time and noticed how flimsy the lenses are. They pop back and forth with very little pressure. I normally like thicker lenses for my sunglasses I have found that normally the thicker lenses are a lot more durable.
4.0,love the shirt but unfortunately it's a smidge tighter and I would've liked
4.0,I bought this for my granddaughter and it fit well and is just the right style for her dainty wrist.
4.0,"It's a nice looking watch band, but you can't adjust the size!!  I've worked for three days, using two different methods to remove the pins and after bending and breaking what I have, only one pin has come out!  I would really like to use this band, but with no way to adjust it, I think I've wasted my money.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After spraying it down with WD40, I finally got the pins out.  There are two pins in each hole, I guess that is why they are hard to remove.  I gave it one more star because now that I can wear it, it is a nice watch band."
4.0,"Love, love, love this dress. I'm a big girl, and it's nice to find an on-trend dress that fits. Is a little low in the neckline but I added a cami and coordinating jewelry and voila! Tons of compliments EVERY time I wear it. Washes and hangs dry beautifully. Can't wait to add boots and accessorize this beauty for fall!"
4.0,"I like everything about this shirt - color, design, sizing, quality of material/seams, etc.  The only thing that kept me from rating this a 5 star is the weight of the zipper.  If you don't have the zipper mostly closed it pulls on the collar due to the weight of it.  It is also noticeable while wearing so a lighter zipper would be more comfortable.  Other than this minor issue I'm sure I'll enjoy wearing it on the course during the summer heat once I've washed it.  I purchased my standard size and it fits as expected."
4.0,"Was hoping this would be a little stretchy for comfort, but no such luck. Looks exactly like pic. If you're looking for a little give, make sure you order a size up"
4.0,An easy dress for a casual summer night if chesty size up .
4.0,Nice colors. But it wasn't my style so I gave it to someone who loved it.
4.0,"Everything was a perfect fit except for the stockings and the bra. Bra was kinda big (my fault, I'm flat chested) and the stockings were so short I swear they were designed for a toddler. Love the lab coat! Perfect for my costume idea"
4.0,got my sister the blue one it looks very nice.
4.0,"Not much to say, it's a little folding toiletry bag. The mesh zipped portion can hold your shampoos, etc. The main section zips open and although you sort of have to dig around inside through the zipper opening, it's roomy enough. If you use small, flat bottles to store shower gel, shampoo, etc, the bag will fold nicely."
4.0,So far so good.  It was as advertised and delivered in a timely manner.
4.0,It’s good for the price pretty thin but nice for a hot day. Runs true to size order medium for a 8 year old.
4.0,I’ve used this brand for years. My only issue was that I received the wrong color frames. I opted to keep the brown frames vs the black frames I originally ordered.
4.0,"These are great goggles but they don't fit over my prescription eyeglasses. To be fair, the seller never said they would but I took a chance because of the low price. So as a point of reference, my eyeglasses are 5.5"" wide and 1.75"" tall and they will not fit inside these goggles. Again, the seller did not represent that they would. They are great goggles for the price and my wife can wear them over her much narrower prescription eyeglasses."
4.0,"Should have gotten a medium, oh well, can always adjust the fit by sewing.. the breast area was a bit loose"
4.0,Very nice and fit great but would be perfect if they had a crotch zipper.
4.0,I like the length. I’m 5’ 7” it is a little tight in the arms but other than that it is just what I expected.
4.0,"I am overall pleased with these disco ball stud earrings. They are great for everyday wear. I did find the bottom two colors shown are a little closer than color than I expected. However, still beautiful. They seem to be good quality and don't look like cheap earrings when they are on. I like the size of these earrings as they are able to be worn comfortably to sleep. They are a good item for children and adults.<br /><br />My only con with this product is that one of the pairs matching stud back had the post hole in the completely wrong spot and it was not functional. However, I felt this to be a minor production flaw as all other pairs backings fit just fine. I was able to just use one of the other colors backings for the earrings. This was no problem at all, because lets face it... my jewelry box is full of earring backs but the earrings themselves always end up missing.<br /><br />I have gotten many compliments on these sparkly gems and currently the silver ones are my favorite to wear! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to have pretty stylish earrings at a very affordable cost. Also, any ladies with sensitive ears... These are non-irritating! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"Love the fabric, so super soft and very comfortable cut. The fit is not compression but is a great first layer."
4.0,"Like the pants.  Fit great!  I would definitely buy them again.  Only problem I have is the pricing of one pair vs. another.  That is why I only bought one pair.  If they had all been priced the 19.99 AND had the size I needed, I would definitely have bought more than one pair."
4.0,I love this outfit on me
4.0,"This is my daughter's review.  "" I love that they make loud sounds"".  She then went on to show me her dance moves.  She is 3 and loves them."
4.0,"I like these shirts and they are very comfortable. Yet, I washed them and one shirt already has a hole and snag in it. I cannot find the information to contact the supplier."
4.0,"I usually wear size XL, but I ordered 3XL, based on the reviews that this shirt ran small to size. It’s a bit more snug than I would like, but do-able. It fits more like a size Large. The fabric is the quick-dry polyester and a bit shiny, but I like it. The sleeves fit snugly at the biceps. I can see how this isn’t a shirt that will fit everyone’s taste, but I like it. Just wish it fitted a bit more loosely."
4.0,"Item is just a described, but are a bit heavy for me."
4.0,"they are a little hard to get on, but once you do they are easy to walk in, but not an all day on your feet kind of boot. I have a wide calf and these fit perfectly, there is even room to wear them with jeans, definitely for girls with big legs and calf's"
4.0,Es un jacket muy comodo y caliente y a un buen precio
4.0,"The material is super soft, and comfortable. It fits my hips, but they are extremely long. I am 5'2 so I  short, but they pants were 9 to 12 inches too long. Will be heming them to fit, just frustrating."
4.0,looks beautiful but somewhat small
4.0,cute and soft little key chain
4.0,Doesn’t match well
4.0,"Great costume necklace! Loved wearing it to a Gatsby Party. It would have 5 stars but one stone fell out of it before the night was over. I also took off the chain and replaced it with elastic leading to a perfect comfortable fit.<br /><br />BUT FYI, it is not like the one shown in the pic. It is completely flat meaning it is not bigger on the bottom and smaller at the top. Still was very satisfied"
4.0,Very nice Capri leggings. Especially if you're a tall girl like me (5'7.5&#34;) they are actual Capri leggings that go about mid calf. But I ordered a M/L and I have a very small waist but big hips& quads & glutes so it fits everything but my 28&#34; waist.
4.0,"The reason I am giving it a 4 I because it did not come with the sash and the fit wasn’t the most flattering on me. I believe this dress looks more attractive on a woman whose a little taller and smaller chest. The measurements were accurate. Normally I wear a size 6 in dresses but ordered an 8 due to bust. I’m 5’3, 130, 38 bust, 28 waist, 34.5 hips. Hope this helps."
4.0,"These are super cute. I do love the color and I thought I’d like the pockets but they fit different than other versions of these pants without pockets. Also, if you have issues with thighs rubbing beware it will cause like rough patches where the thighs rub."
4.0,It is a little too big on the top but I guess it can ne fix.
4.0,"This is a great base. The neck collar needs to be redesigned. The front height is the same as the back and it has a choking feel like the shirt is on backwards. Otherwise, it is fine."
4.0,"It's OK, but fits big in my waist.  Nice skirt though."
4.0,I got this for my granddaughter that just passed her State Nursing Licensing Exam. I think she will like this little charm.<br />It is very cute.
4.0,Bag is smaller than I wouldn't have like and I wish there were more pockets But the bag is made well and looks as though it will last a long time. I am considering another style in the same brand And will still use this one.
4.0,Don't know about the fit yet. Love the design. Nothing ever gets 5 stars.
4.0,Feathers are great... nice buy
4.0,I love this earrings I think it beautiful and I love the Rhinestones it came in mail a little late but it was pack nicely and I wear this a few times outside people's says how beautiful they are and look and I'm so happy I have this earlier rings I would buy another one again the only problem is u need to be careful because it can easy brakes but other then that I would definitely recommend this
4.0,Quality is great but runs very small. I am small framed and busty.
4.0,"Happy with the product, unfortunately was a little too small for my son's shoes"
4.0,"Love the pattern. Super excited to wear it , the arms are a little bit tight but I think it's just the type of material. For reference im 5'5 ,160lbs 38b. Told everyone I got a new dress and showed them the pic they already love it and are dying for me to wear it."
4.0,"I love these! I bought a full costume for Harley a while back, but have been wanting to replace the bottoms because the ones she wears are sparkly and not just shiny like the ones I got with the costume. I ordered a size bigger because I expected them to fit small, and I was right. I am a medium and I ordered a large. At first when I saw them I thought I'd made a mistake because they looked a little big for me but once I put them on I breathed a sigh of relief because they fit perfectly. So the reason I selected that they fit as &quot;somewhat small&quot; is because I anticipated they would and ordered a size larger, which I would recommend for you to do as well. They are a bit scratchy, but that's to be expected. They look great, though! I can't wait to cosplay her at comicon this year now!"
4.0,the reason that I got these earrings was because of the gold part I can hardly fine these kind of earrings with gold  thank you
4.0,Good dress for the price. I received a lot of compliments when I wore it. It rides up a bit so I kept having to pull it down because the split in the back would show too much of you don't. I'm 6ft tall. It looked nice for work.
4.0,This was a gift and was priced decent was exactly as advertised
4.0,"They are comfortable, lightweight and stylish to dress in casual or sports.<br />I liked and recommend.<br />It can also be used for running."
4.0,These are very cute but I wore them for about a week and they’re already dull and not shiny anymore. Boo :(
4.0,"I have not worn these socks yet. However, I am a big octopus fan and and I'm looking forward to wearing these.<br />  The Crazy Sock Lady of Cheyenne"
4.0,Works better than others I’ve tried. While skiing my sunglasses stay dry if I’m moving or there’s a breeze. Otherwise they get wet instead of foggy.  Enter than being blind  and they clear up when I get off the lift.  Still wish there was something better
4.0,"Not a bad keychain, a bit small but it works!"
4.0,This is my second Mordenmiss dress. Beautifully made and the fabric is wonderful. I do wish they would make more dresses with 3/4 sleeves
4.0,Love the comfort of the material and fit
4.0,"Super comfy, but cups are set a tad narrow for me. Still fits, just not a perfect fit. Love the stretchy lace."
4.0,"I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I really like this bra. It's cute, comfortable, fits well for the most part. This bra is absolutely NOT a bra that I can work out in. I am a 34 E. It's comfortable to lounge around in or to wear under a strappy shirt, but I would fall right out the bottom of this bra. I'm glad I bought it, but I don't think I would've if it wasn't discounted because of the support issue. Please be advised that if you are a larger cup size (I would say anything larger than a large C), it's not really a good bra to work out in unless you are doing yoga or something low impact."
4.0,"It's very pretty, looks very nice. The straps broke almost immediately - but I was able to fix it. They were also too long so I had to make them shorter."
4.0,"Usually a medium, but ordered a large. Definitly go a size up. It's good for its price. The colors of the words are not as bright as shown in the picture. That's mainly my only complaint. They are kind of hard to see because it's very bright. Not like shown in the picture. Slightly wrinkled around the letters because of how they were placed on the shirt. I tried ironing it (ON LOW!!!), but still couldn't fix it. But I'm not too worried about that! Not super noticable. Like I said, good for the price. Overall happy. Will definitly be wearing to the concert I am going to."
4.0,"fairly firm sole, easy to wear, comfortable.  arch support is middle"
4.0,The only thing I didn't  like about these glasses was that the top right and left portion  of the glasses had a section  that jutted out.  They reminded me of glasses women wore in the 1950s.
4.0,Looks exactly like the picture & came earlier than expected. Could have been a little smaller but over all its nice.
4.0,"Cute, fits nicely, only reason 4 star is I wish it was a little longer other than that great buy and a very nice print!"
4.0,"I'm 5'7 and 185lbs and ordered an xl- pear shaped. Throughout the day this was constantly riding up and I was adjusting. I was in constant fear also that I would rip the seam that holds the front together each time I had to use the restroom which is a whole other story within itself. I feel like the bottom was snug, and the top was almost too loose (38d). Weird fit for my body."
4.0,Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!!
4.0,"The front is sparkly, kind of cheap material. Perfect size for a toddler, would like the handles to be more sturdy. Was using it for school, but I’m reconsidering it."
4.0,The goggles is very nice especially with the ear plugs attached. But the cap is bit too small for me.
4.0,I liked the Colors! Also love that it has back details too!  it is eye catching! However I am a bit tall and despite getting my size I felt it could be a bit bigger or at least longer for torso! Overall it was a good costume! I added an led tutu which made it more fun! Kids loved it.
4.0,This top is appropriate to wear to work (business casual) or for a night out with the family. It's comfortable and stylish and I'm thinking about getting another one in a different color.
4.0,The top fit perfectly. The bottoms were way to tight. Very revealing as far as the bottoms go. I just tossed them aside.
4.0,"Too casual for my event. This is made of a stretchy tshirt material. It’s cute, but not what I needed, so I returned it."
4.0,These are nice and large but I was given another pair from a friend so I will wear these next Halloween.  they are a soft rubber material.
4.0,The plate is on is a little on the small
4.0,High waistline hides muffin top.  They do seem to attract pet hair.
4.0,"4 stars bc they look very nice, they were too short and I went with my normal big size. I wear 8-8,5-9, 9 usually being too big. Shoes fit width wise, but felt very short so I would be snug if I had ordered up. Seller is good, showed up sooner. Will sell or give away."
4.0,Very nice orange and adjustable. Goes well with many outfits. I suggest you get yourself one and expand your wardrobe
4.0,A little on the right size but could be my fat head 😏
4.0,Love the belt - second one I’ve bought.  Only thing that I would change is the extra material that needs to be looped to stay in place - it sometimes bunches up.
4.0,Sleeves where too long and too large!  Body and waist where good.
4.0,"My son likes it and it arrived undamaged, unlike some other reviewers' experience.  The lightening bolt don't stay on very well, we may end up gluing them on."
4.0,"These socks are very thin but the patterns are crisp and clean. I could see my red toenail polish through the solid black sock, if that gives you a better idea. I was disappointed that one pair came with what looks like a manufacturing flaw in them (small hole near top). Not bothering to return them as I need socks badly! If they wash well would purchase them again. Will update post after I do."
4.0,"While the hat looks exactly like the picture it has an odd fit. It is a very deep cap so it can bend your ears if u have a smaller head. Plus the bill is oddly long compared to other adult size ball caps. Love the design, dislike the fit. Thankfully, I purchased while on sale and only paid $23 instead of the full price of thirty-something. Otherwise, I'd have probably returned it. If you have a bigger noggin, it'll probably fit fine and perhaps the bill won't seem so weird."
4.0,"Overall I think this is a good addition to my jewelry collection, therefore it's a keeper"
4.0,I didn't like how easily and how fast it started to fall apart.
4.0,I like the different skull designs but the bandana's themselves are very thin.  You can pretty much see through them.  I haven't washed them yet so husband hasn't used them but hopefully they work well for his headbands for work.
4.0,It is nice quality and a nice price. I would recommend this item.
4.0,"The product is made out of stretchy material and its not sown good because when I tried to put it on it stretched and the seams started coming part. Also, since it is made out of a cheap material, since im a bit more busty, its super stretch out and is white in the middle....I don't like and It looks cheap....<br />Update...<br />The seller was kind enough to offer to send me a replacement or a refund, which they did not have to do. I thank them for taking the time out to reach out to me based on my initial dissatisfaction and was willing to make it right! I got a replacement and I am so grateful! Thank you Lookatool!"
4.0,"These sleeves are a God sent. My arms are always burning while I drive, even when I do apply sunscreen. Most jackets are way too hot and I don't have the money to tint my car windows. These sleeves are the perfect solution to my problem! The only issue is the I have orangutan arms, so the sleeves are shorter than i would like. Also, I expected these sleeves to be white. The turned out to be an ugly gray color. They work well, but I was expecting a slightly different product."
4.0,Bought this for my wife.  Fits perfectly. She loves it.
4.0,"Fits really nicely, material is thick, be careful with size because there is no stretch. Pockets would make it perfect!"
4.0,Not a good quality plastic like some others I've purchased but they are spring loaded.
4.0,They are all very nicely made plugs but are just small looking. At first I thought they had sent me all 2’s instead of 0’s but they work.
4.0,"Really cute remind you of Pandora bracelet, only thing I don't like when take off all beads fall off on floor of not careful."
4.0,They fit my rx glasses well. As you can see the second picture with sunglass clip does not cover a tiny portion of the lower glass but we were on a 18 hour road trip and I felt no impairment because of it. Not too dark. Easy to clip over my frames
4.0,Really pretty color. A little smaller than I thought but great for an undershirt.
4.0,the band around the waist is thicker right at the bottom of the band. Enough to stick out and look like a small belly pooch when you wear it with a loose top. If you plan on tucking your shirt in should be fine. I kept mine. Colors beautiful and great for Zumba class.
4.0,"These earrings were exactly what I was looking for, as well as being priced well. I will likely continue to shop here for my everyday earrings instead of going back to a department store."
4.0,"The design and size of this product were both really nice. However, after I wore this bracelet somewhat regularly, after about a month, part of the chain broke, making it unusable."
4.0,"This sweater is a good buy.  The sleeves are a little shorter than I expected by looking at the picture and sizing chart but overall, it’s comfy and a good buy."
4.0,Nice color light fabric classy looking
4.0,"I have such a problem finding aviators that fit my face and my concern with these was that they would look the same. The bottom is longer which means I can wear them and it was 2 weeks of bliss - until (and this is where they loose a star), one of the nose pads got stuck in my hair and fell right out. The other one followed close behind. I still wear them every once in awhile because they still look great but without the pads they slip off.<br /><br />The finish is great! Very resilient and had I taken care of them with the case that is pretty awesome, I wouldn't have to be ordering a new pair however... I am ordering the same exact thing because of the style."
4.0,"I purchased this for bending stamped aluminum bracelets that I make. It works well for starting the shape of the bracelet (in my case cuffs), but its hard to get a perfectly asymmetrical shape using this alone. I get the basic shape with this bar, then put the bracelet on a mandrel and hammer to get the final, finished shape.  In my opinion, this is a necessary tool to shape the bracelet, but I also have to use additional tools to finish them."
4.0,Looks like a quality glasses case but will have to use for a while. I have owned several cases the hinge always breaks.
4.0,"I purchased the Coffee in 3XL. Approximate measurements: underarm to underarm 18.5"", shoulder to hem 23.5"". Typically I wear a M-L in tops and sometimes XL for a relaxed fit. Thanks to reading the reviews and looking at the size chart, I ordered several sizes larger. The 3XL fit like a women's size large, fitted but not tight. The fabric is smooth, thin and stretchy. The coffee color is slightly lighter than the picture and more of a dusty medium brown.  Overall it's fairly well made top and I'm considering order several more in different colors to wear as base layers under sweaters."
4.0,"I love this purse with one exception.  One of the zipper pulls was missing. I added my own. Other than that, it's a good purse."
4.0,"I recommend these as long as you are able to get the appropriate size at a favorable price.  At the current price of $14.99, they are a reasonable buy (not a deal).<br /><br />Size: I received the XXL (Adult M/L).  They are much smaller than M/L; the fit is more like XS/S.  I am 5'4"", 110 lbs and they are snug at he waist (so they should stay put well).  I'm glad I didn't get the the next size down.<br /><br />Style:  These do not have a contoured foot as some tight do.  They also have a seam at the end of the toes, so expect to adjust it to avoid having it rub on the end of your toes.  The seam is soft, so this is not a big deal."
4.0,"It protects and puts a nice style to your key fob. Only down side is that it cuts certain distance signal to your car. But its very doable, just get closer to the vehicle."
4.0,"Size up at least once if not 2-3x if you want it to fit how it is shown on the model. It is very stretchy and more of a bodycon fit. Regardless, it is soft and comfortable."
4.0,"Just got these pendants today for my boyfriend and I, they are so pretty got a few marks on them but nothing to bad. I got them a week before I was supposed too, and even added and extra chain."
4.0,"Fingers got thinner and rather than modify the ring, I started using tape...  not great.<br /><br />These are a more permanent solution.  Easy to install and comfortable when wearing!"
4.0,Nice suit. Fits well.
4.0,Top fit just perfectly but bottoms were a little small. I'm 5'6 and 139lbs. I ordered size med which is an 8-10. The top looks great but if you are curvy at the bottom or have wide hips try and find a bigger bottom. Although I can put the bottoms on by bottom doesn't look great so I have to use different bottoms that fit better. Wish there was a way to order a different size for top and bottom.
4.0,Scarf is very pretty. Colors are prettier than pictured.
4.0,Chest part is way more open than shown in picture.
4.0,"Great value for thr money. They are easy to attach to a chain. Sturdy foe larger pieces, smaller clasps broke easily."
4.0,I was pleased with the order.  The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because 4 of the 48 were bent and wrinkled.  Otherwise I was very happy.
4.0,I really love them.  They fit comfortably. They're a little flimsy but the cuteness out weighs that.
4.0,"This dress is very cute! It is a fabric with sheen, so be aware of that. I wasn't expecting that from the photo. It will be an adorable way to dress up for Halloween parties and events without a full costume."
4.0,"Bag provides me everything i need it to do, thanks"
4.0,"Well made product.  I use it to support some of my fly rods, when going fly fishing.  So there's not much weight.  So the metal rings may &#34;bounce out of&#34; the hooks in the vehicle, on rough roads.  If you had some weight on it, such as clothing (that's what it's designed for!), I'm sure this would not be a problem. Easily adjusts in width."
4.0,Very soft and comfy. Washes up great. No shrinkage.
4.0,"I honestly didn’t care for this shirt initially. But especially considering the price point, this is a keeper"
4.0,runs maybe half size small but wonderfully playful and comfy shoes!  wish I had gotten 9 instead of 8.5
4.0,"I really like this boot bag. I invested in new boots, and wanted to be able to keep them clean. My only issue is that the bag doesn't stand up very well. It falls forward. I know that has something to do with the shape of my boots, but the boots stand up on their own. It's not idea."
4.0,They took a bit to get here (I actually forgot I ordered them) but they’re beautiful. I get tons of compliments.
4.0,Kinda works but may fall off
4.0,The item stay true to the pic. However I ordered a small and got a medium I kept it cause it did fit. I must say the finishings and quality exceeded my expectations.
4.0,"I love this idea of being able to customize your t-shirt yourself.<br />The implementation is mostly well done, an impressive first pass!<br />There are a few issues that need work to make this truly useful.<br />1. as you make revisions to a t-shirt you have received, I could not find a way to identify which iteration I was modifying, as a result, you do not get what you are expecting. In my case, I was playing with the different colors and fabric and looking for a different fit in each case, but when I was modifying it seems like it was picking the most recently delivered item... you should be able to pick an item to modify by date for order! Or even better, each item should be labeled with a unique id on the inner tag, so you can pick that id and modify it, or reorder the exact same one.<br />2. with the core fabric (the less stretchy one), I am having trouble getting sleeves that are tight, I keep going down in size, but it's the same cut, meaning that I keep having an outer flare on the sleeve, albeit it's getting smaller and smaller. you should be able to make the tshirt sleeve tight (flush all around) with a horizontal cut line... I could get that result with the stretchy thinner fabric, but not the core one.<br /><br />One final note: the adjustments inch by inch of a revision is the most useful aspect of this product, because you really get to fine tune how it looks, it's awesome! The current problem is that you can't pick reliably what you are modifying.<br />I am hoping an amazon product manager can look at this :-)"
4.0,"I am 5'8&#34;, 38DDD and usually wear a 14/16....These are good when you need something to wear underneath.... the backs are definitely racer... so that might make a difference in what you are wearing.  They are snug fitting, as these types of tanks usually are...Honestly, I use these with shorts for sleeping.  They are soft and comfortable... they washed and dried well.  I always update if there are any issues."
4.0,"This was great for my younger kids. The only issue is due to the quick release, a safety feature, if the kids pull on the elastic then the elastic comes out of the rubber stopper."
4.0,It's very smooth but pretty form fitting.
4.0,I got these for my grandchildren ages 2-14 and they fit all. I wear a size 9 shoe and they fit me and hit right about the ankle. They were the size large for kids. Super soft and whimsical. Great stocking stuffers!
4.0,"I purchased this dress for the Renaissance Festival. I chose this style as it will be easy to continue nursing my daughter with the stretchy neck line.<br /><br />I took the dress out of the delivery box and thought, &#34;oh no, it's too big,&#34; but when I tried it on it fit perfectly!<br /><br />Super excited for RenFest now and this dress will be great for a wedding I have in the fall!"
4.0,Good value 3 belts appropriate for matching with all my golf attire.  That’s the only place I’ll be wearing the white one.
4.0,"It took me a couple days to decide, but I ended up returning this. I just couldn’t get it to look good with anything I own! I also realize that I really like the way it looks from the side but not from the front.<br /><br />I do want to say that it is a nice material and fit. The shirt top is nice because it’s fitted around the chest but loose around the stomach."
4.0,This tee is super cute for the price
4.0,"Love the dress - price is great.  The bodice of the dress is lined.  The only down side is that the waist sits a little higher than my actual waist, so it feels a little short in the bodice."
4.0,"I LOVE the snugness, but these things are SHORT, when you measure from the crotch to the waistband, even for low-rise briefs. Not super into these and really can't imagine wearing them."
4.0,"So when I put that it fits as expected I mean it fits as I think a normal D cup bra would fit, not a sports bra. I bought my regular size band and size D cup bra and didn't think I would need to go down a cup size to get that good bounce control support I like but I should have. Since the description said Level 4 high impact I thought it would provide a little more support, don't get me wrong the support is good for a low impact strength training workout like I did today but when I did cardio the other day I wore my Nike Pro sports bra that I bought in a Medium which is great for jumping or running. Now if you don't care about a little moving when running than I would recommend this bra but if you want just about no movement at all I would suggest something else. Other than that the straps and racer back are very comfortable to work out in and it's not squeezing me to death around my rib cage."
4.0,"Excellent quality, nicer even than the pix. Different and pretty."
4.0,These are lightweight and comfortable. They don’t have the little wire above the nose but the size is perfect for me so that didn’t matter so much
4.0,"This is actually a very nice dress and I decided to review it even though after trying two sizes, it just didn't fit me correctly. But it is a nice weight with some heft and doesn't not cling too much, something that is sometimes hard to find.  For in inexpensive dress there is a nice quality to the cut and finishing as well.  In my own case, I first ordered an XL and found it just a bit too clingy to my middle curvy parts.  I was happy there was an XXL but in the end,  something about the overall fit was just a bit too large. Still a nice dress for a good value."
4.0,"I love these but I have a 4 star for ONE reason....when I got them in, I wanted to put one in immediately...they are so tightly screwed on to the bar piece that I had to use plyers to undo the balls. Other than that, I had NO problems with shipping or packaging and I haven't had any break so far"
4.0,"A nice navy neck tie. It feels fairly substantial, and it is not prone to creasing. This product is made in China."
4.0,"My friend likes it.  Stiff wicker cracks, use with care.  Could be better packaged."
4.0,Love tge way this dress fits me it just recieved wrong color and didnt have to to exchange before event.
4.0,"I have several pairs of these and use them for jogging so I can carry my mobile phone in the hip pocket. They are a buttery soft, incredible fabric that wicks moisture. ADVICE: sizing is WAY OFF. By the chart, I'd be an extra small... Nope! Medium fits, but it's still tight in the waist when I sit in them (more jogging, then, lol!) Size up one size and you'll be happy with the snug fit and not struggling to breathe."
4.0,The sizing is way off. I am a large in us sizing.  This 3x barely fit me. I am 5'10 it just fee as if it was meant for short women. I still pull it off and it looks very nice. It's low cut in the back too
4.0,Fit slightly large
4.0,"UPDATED REVIEW!!<br />I have now owned and used this great bag daily for about 2 months! It is still in fantastic shape and fits just what I need, nothing more, nothing less! I had mentioned in my original review the stuff leather but I'll say after daily wear this has softened and it feels and looks fantastic! I am very much in love with my bag. I use it for daily purposes (I pack light) and for dressier events.<br /><br />Gorgeous handbag. I absolutely love the functionality of the design. Wear on shoulder, cross body or as a clutch. The color ink is the perfect navy and it goes well with the light gold hardware. Very spacious as well. I easily fit my MK medium sugar zip wallet, powder compact and a few lip products, keys, phone, sunglasses, pens and small notebook.I love the back slip pocket for my phone while shopping. The cons are the metal chain is not super nice quality but it is better than say.... a target store purse hardware. The leather also feel dry and stiff but a good leather conditioner will remedy that. Amazon's price was fantastic! Overall I am really happy with my purse. It is functional and gives me the style of a chanel without the used car price tag!"
4.0,"Such a cute shoe!  My daughter was so sad that we had to send them back!  The shoe seems to run wide and my daughter has an average to narrow foot.  Also, the shoe doesn't have a lot of support."
4.0,A little too expensive for a keychain  but it's very nice.
4.0,"Nice, soft sweater. Great length for leggings. Only wish I could machine wash & dry. Size 2XL."
4.0,"I loved the jacket material and fit, except it was quite long on the body. I’m 6’3 and ordered a Large.  Some people may want that extra length, but not what I was looking for."
4.0,A TABLE CLOTH CUT WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE FOR YOUR HEAD
4.0,"I really like the quality of the shirt,  I got a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"Great price, I'm happy with my order. I only gave it 4 stars because they're very thin, expected a little bit better quality."
4.0,For the price it's perfect...exactly what I was looking for. One size fits all....generally I'm a size 8 and this is very roomy (which is what I wanted) - would fit size 10 comfortably maybe even size 12.  It is longer on me than on model (she is tall and thin) but it's ok...I may just trim up fringe...Fringe will tangle and knot up if not hand washed .... material quick drying so hand washing and hang to dry is easy!
4.0,Nice and comfortable. Only complain is that the material has a tendency to rub off.
4.0,Great quality just to sheer for a child age ten ok for adults
4.0,"I’ve been looking for a knock off maya Brenner and this definitely does the job. I love it, it’s dainty and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments. They also sent me free earrings that were really pretty."
4.0,Cute still have from 2013 to now 2018<br />Cheaply made but the price isnt bad
4.0,"I love this handbag!!  It’s justvthe size I was looking for. The description said Grey. Mine is not grey....at all. It’s more of a brown. It’s beautiful, but not Grey.  I’m keeping it."
4.0,Super cute shoes! They are a darker orange than in the picture but still adorable
4.0,I read the reviews and ordered the small thinking that it would fit like a man's shirt. It doesn't! The medium would have fit well. I am sending back to get a medium.
4.0,I bought this item as a gift for a friend.  The prayer shawl came inside a very nice bag that matches.
4.0,Pretty good cheap sunglasses
4.0,"This dress is so cute. I got a lot of complements. Fit great and was a little stretchy which is nice for a busty gal like myself. I do recommend getting/ wearing a crinoline underneath, to poof out the skirt. I did have to pull down the skirt as it rode up, overall loved it."
4.0,"I liked the sunglasses.  I thought that the multi-colored lens was the polarized lens. It turns out it was the basic black lens.  They worked well.  The only draw back is that they seem more for a male.  When I was wearing them, I felt like it looked like I was borrowing my boyfriends sunglasses.  Other than that, they worked really well for the price.  I hope they last for a while."
4.0,Large was more like a small!
4.0,"Nice comfortable shirt, not too thick. These run in Walmart sizes not Gap sizes ie they run big. I am normally a Large but had to return it for a medium. The nice thing about it is the dual buttons on the wrist so you can get the wrist tighter fitting if you want. I also like the buttons on the collar so its not flappy."
4.0,"Not exactly how it's was pictured, the blue is much darker.. it makes it much less of a statment. Sadface."
4.0,The style is great! A bit too see through for my style.
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress that is amazing quality for the price. However, the brand's size chart was not accurate. I have ordered from Ever-Pretty before and my previous dresses from this brand all ran true to their size charts. But not this one. I ordered a US 8 according to the brand's size chart in the product photos. With my measurements (35&#34; bust, 29&#34; waist), it should have fit well, perhaps even slightly big in the bust since I wouldn't be wearing a bra with the padded top. Instead, the dress did not even come close to zipping up, and I couldn't close the hook-and-eye at the top of the zipper (around the bust) either. My US 8 measured 17&#34; flat across the bust, and 14&#34; flat across the waist - which would have been a US 4-6 according to the product size chart. I have re-ordered it in a US 10, and I hope it fits this time."
4.0,"ordered my usual size, M, and thought it was too tight in the chest area. Lightweight, cute, and otherwise."
4.0,The stone is wayyyyy toooo big.
4.0,I liked it a lot.
4.0,I was surprised at how soft the jacket is and how well it fit. My only complaint is that one pocket has a hole in that I just sewed instead of sending back.
4.0,"Stylish, warm, breathes.  A wee bit tight.  GIven to me as a gift so don't know value for money"
4.0,"I really love this dress.  Not sure why there are some bad reviews.<br />I ordered a size up, as per the suggestions from previous reviews.  I wish I hadn't.  I am 5'9&#34; and 160 lbs and ordered a XL.  I wish I had ordered a L but nothing a belt won't fix.  The XL fell about an inch or two above my knees."
4.0,"The fabric is awesome! The fit? Too tight across my shoulders. A great gift for my narrow-shouldered friend. Length is good, too."
4.0,"Was for a Father daughter dance, had to have someone take it in some at top. Will say granddaughter is on thin side. She loved the dress."
4.0,These would make for a nice gift for a young girl or to fancy up an outfit. Pretty nice quality.
4.0,"The bracelet is really cute, I love it. But, you really do get what you pay for. The gold bead is painted, and eventually starts chipping and becomes white. I repainted it with gold nailpolish! The clasp is cheap and mine broke about 5 times before I just decided to tie the bracelet closed with string. Again, for a $5 bracelet, you can't really expect much more. If you're a Harry Potter fan, and willing to make a bunch of adjustments to fix it, it is cute!"
4.0,My son's love them
4.0,"I love it!.... but I can't wear it. Maybe I'm just not using it right, but I can't get it to comfortably close enough to not eventually (or immediately) slip right off from its own weight. I don't have a cute small nose, either, so I thought maybe I would've avoided that problem.<br /><br />I was wondering how a clicker style would look, though, and this let me check that out at least. :)"
4.0,These glasses are great on my 4yo.  THey aren't too big on his face and look adorable on him.  The mirrored lenses do look a little messy when you get finger prints on them but they easily wipe away.
4.0,it’s just that I feel like I’m going to break it everytime the clay gets squished.
4.0,Used for father who has edema and we were able to get a pair that fit perfectly.
4.0,My boyfriend loved it the minute he saw it on me.  Great bra.  Comfortable and flirty. Love it!
4.0,Expected them to be more strudy
4.0,"Firstly, i love this dress and get tons of compliments on it every time i wear it. The cut is flattering and feels so comfortable. The down side is the fabric. The print is just printed on it (not woven into it), so the color is fading after only a few months.  I did order a size down and that was a prefect fit for me."
4.0,"Bought these pants for dancing and going out. For the price they are really cute and exactly the look I was going for. I love all the pockets (4 total). Some things I would say are that the pants run small and the material is not stretchy so it's not as nice for dancing. The material isn't extremely comfy but not terrible. And the straps on the bottom are adjustable if you have bigger calves. The waistband fits very tight. Overall they look cute, I got lots of compliments, and they're affordable. Order a size up if you're not totally sure."
4.0,Really cute. Great for a grumpy grandpa!
4.0,Product received corresponded to website info and so far the product has lived up to expectations.
4.0,I little too big for me
4.0,"The rubber coating at the “fork” really helps to prevent scuffing on your boots. The ridges on the main part of the jack really helps grip the boot you are using to hold down the jack. My only criticism is that the jack starts to bend under pressure of a firm fitting boot. Was afraid it might break, but it didn’t. It’s lightweight and allowed me to get off a pair of redwing Chelsea boots"
4.0,"It's pretty and curly, but sheds a lot. I've found many silver hairs wherever I wear it. Other than that, good quality for the price."
4.0,Nice made of light weight material perfect for summer.
4.0,I ordered a size 3 and got a size 4. The box says size 3 but when I opened a size 4 was in the box. Really nice slippers if I had gotton what I ordered I would've rated 5 stars but I'm a bit disappointed with the mix up. My son on the other hand is refusing to take it off even though it looks like it belongs to his older brother
4.0,"I like these - great vintage look but with a nice updated bit of stretch that makes them far more comfortable! Super cute, very casual but they seem to run a tad large. Nice full height waistline and good coverage but the slightly larger size means a little sloppiness to the fit."
4.0,"I really like this Celtic cross, great look (one sided), love the size, just perfect.  I originally liked the rope/string necklace a creative use of knots to make sizing very easy, but then the knots came undone.  I was a boy scout and can retie the notes but from the store they only lasted two days, should last much longer.  I got a chain necklace for it now, looks great."
4.0,I love love love this shirt but it’s a little tight even though I ordered a large.
4.0,"I had to set my watch to correct hour, second and minute.  To me, it was a cumbersome, time consuming process.  Also, it's advertised as a solar watch.  Instructions instruct one to charge it weekly and caution direct sunlight.  It is not what I thought it would be, but I will keep it.  It's worth the price."
4.0,I really like the way it looks on my ear (though I did have to bend it to make it fit right).<br />I can't wear it very long though because it's actually a little bit too heavy for an earring.
4.0,Easy way to turn a sweater into a multi layer and less casual looking
4.0,Bought it for my 7 year old boy.  No complaints yet.
4.0,These were smaller than they looked in picture. But they work very well as pulls on my purse and coin purse.
4.0,Cool if you like frogs
4.0,The colors are pretty. The pants are a bit too long for a petite person like me. The cotton is not very soft. Hope it will soften up after wash.
4.0,"Believe the reviews. Very cute combat shoes, but they are a rad small. Mine are still wearable, but toes are slightly touching edge on the inside. I didn't see an option for 1/2 sizes, but if there is that option for you, take it. A half size up should fit normally. Why manufacturers can't all be held to standard sizing do they're all in same page w consumers, is beyond me."
4.0,"As expected- good fit, no complaints."
4.0,"Fabric good quality but heavier than I expected. Print is great, good color. Larger than expected, and rather shapeless because of this - seriously consider sizing down from what you usually wear."
4.0,It's a cute set but just not very flattering on me. It fit fine. I think the color just isn't my style.
4.0,"I like how they look, they are great with boots, but for me I didn't care for the material."
4.0,they were great coverage!
4.0,That’s what it supposed to do
4.0,"My daughter gave me this necklace when she got married last year. I ordered another one just in case this one tarnishes. Every time I wear it I always get compliments. I gave it four stars instead of five because the clasp that connects the necklace is very small and hard for me to put the necklace on sometimes. I took it off and put on a larger one, problem solved. This necklace is beautiful and would make a perfect gift for moms and females."
4.0,I emailed the seller my measurements and requested a size 10. Seller responded that I need an 8. I can fit in the 8 but if I gain even a pound I will not be able to zip it. Should have sent me the 10 as I requested.
4.0,"Good quality,  meet my needs"
4.0,"Great band, but color seems to be fading a bit, and the magnet grabs my hair sometimes, which can be painful."
4.0,"These slippers are super comfy, cute and keep my feet warm. I wanted a pair of slippers that weren't plush or &#34;furry&#34; so they would be easy to wipe off and clean unlike my last pair. The only thing I don't like is that they are a little noisy as I'm shuffling around the hardwood floors."
4.0,"I bought this item for my rook piercing - originally 16g 10mm and it was a little too big and uncomfortable. I then bought it in an 18g 8mm which was much better. However because of the shape of this product  I have a lot of trouble sleeping on my side. I will say that the quality of the product is great. No tarnishing or wearing of the metal. I can also easily take it out and put it in myself even though a rook piercing is hard to see on yourself. I would say that if you are a side sleeper maybe buy a different shape ring for your rook or other ear piercing. But if not, this is a cute earring for sure"
4.0,"The ring is exactly as was pictured on Amazon, I have had many compliments on it."
4.0,"I'm not a busty lady, I wear 36C, I'm 165 lbs, 5 ft 5 inches, the large does not button without looking awful... like the buttons are screaming. It's cute, and I love the overall look, as I would wear it open anyhow, but still..."
4.0,"I really like these shirts.  I have seen them at the National Parks we have visited but they rarely have my size, here I can order what I want with the logo I want, been there, done that but had to get the t-shirt at this store."
4.0,Its cute pretty big. Only its vent so i had to straighthen it. Otherwise its okay....
4.0,"Perfect for all my toiletries, odds n ends for travel. Wish it were a teensy bit smaller though. But I would def buy again."
4.0,"The socks had less cotton content than I wanted.  Also, the tops of the socks were very tight...my ankles and lower legs are relatively small and they were tight on me...anyone with a larger lower leg would find these socks very binding.  Even though the socks were said to be unisex, a man couldn’t use them!!"
4.0,"In the event that this item becomes available again, it is well worth the $3.04 cost (including super saver shipping).  It is marked 925 (sterling), is 1 and 1/4 inches wide and almost 1 inch high, including the bale.  In fact, the size is such that it really works nicer on a necklace instead of a charm bracelet.  Also, the bale is large enough to accommodate sliding onto a necklace.  The picture adequately represents the charm, although I think it looks prettier in person.  The workmanship is acceptable, but I would have liked it much more with the back side finished off instead of concave to the front design."
4.0,"The blend  of fabrics in the shirt make it extremely soft and comfortable to wear. The buttons are stitched closed for an attractive look that is not an issue when dressing because of the low &#34;V&#34; cut design. I describe the fit as somewhat small, however: my personal build (slim and athletic) is between a medium and large depending on the manufacturer's style. My advice is to go with the larger size if this situation applies to you.  All in all, a well-made product that I plan to look at other designs by this supplier and purchase again in the future."
4.0,"i love the product , i have small shoulder bags , and i use it for this bags and become crossbody bag"
4.0,"These sweet little shoes look just like the picture! My baby had really long feet so I thought the reviews of too large would be ok, BUT they are reallly big. I'm going to keep them for when she fits them and order a smaller pair. :)"
4.0,"Mechanism (belt buckle) is smooth and the belt seems well made. The nylon is stiff, but somehow still comfortable to wear. Easily supports whatever you clip to it; whether it be your weapon and extra mags, a knife, and/ or even a goofy cell phone case. Lost one star because, in my opinion, the price seems high as compared to other similar products of the same quality."
4.0,nice sock had all the groomsmen and groom in them
4.0,"I'm 5'5"", 155 lbs and these fit fairly well. The navy floral print is beautiful. My one thing is that I wish they were a few inches longer. Usually leggings are too long for me"
4.0,4 stars because it's made in China
4.0,"It's a good clip, not sloppy, will work well.<br /><br />I did expect it to feel a bit less cheap, you can really tell it's just plastic, but oh well."
4.0,"Very nice, I like it!!!!"
4.0,"thick, nice belts."
4.0,"very comfortable, though a bit smaller than I expected."
4.0,"I was disappointed only because it was a day late everything else was fine. It was for a party that happened, but the mask didn't 😡"
4.0,"This is a very well made Snuggie.  It is a generous cut and length.  This will be perfect on long airline flights in the winter.  The bottom is a little restricted for taking long strides, but it can be pulled or bunched up as a long sweatshirt, and let down when the extra coverage is needed.  It is more of a sweatshirt material, but very soft like a thin blanket."
4.0,"Cute, but very light weight and a bit small."
4.0,I got the small and it was cute but to big in the waist if you have a flat stomach.
4.0,"Dial design is very beautiful and cool, but there<br />were slight scratch of cover glass from beginning. I felt disappointment."
4.0,"It's a bit big because I ordered a 1XL not knowing what to expect with the sizing, so I should've gotten the XL instead, but it's not a deal breaker and I didn't want it form-fitting anyways.I like this...just what I was looking for.  I love the ruched sleeves.  I'm going to find another color :)"
4.0,I absolutely love it. My rose was gold. Will make a nice addition to my collection. I can't wait to wear it!
4.0,Beautiful bag nice leather. Packaged nicely and for sure a great buy. If you love Nightmare before Christmas this is a MUST have fof your collection.
4.0,Reallyly liked this hat. It's a little loose on me. Thankfully it has adjustable straps on the back which makes it more snug. It's very nice and comfortable.<br /><br />***rec'd at discounted price in exchange for honest review***
4.0,Need to order several.
4.0,Got a smaller size than usual for the top. Fits well.
4.0,Perfect food themed costume for a penguin plunge for a local food pantry!
4.0,"Hello friends,<br /><br />These leggings. are. comfortable. They are not thick. I live in Minnesota, and would suggest wearing these in fall-weather (which may be other states' winter weather?). I could see myself wearing them until about 20-25F.<br /><br />So, the size. I am a 5'1 85 lb Asian female. I have the stereotypical body of the tiny Asian female (re: no curves, stick with 4 movable limbs, head attached on top). SO, the leggings are a bit long for me. They are not wide and are form-fitting (tight), but the waist goes up above my belly button, and the ankles scrunch a bit at the bottom. Because of that, the crotch area gets a little bit weird, but not really uncomfortable. And this is okay for me, since I plan to wear them only with longer sweaters and boots. However, I suspect if you are either at least 5-10 lbs heavier than me, have some curves, or are 1-3 inches taller than me, it will fit you better.<br /><br />There are some other reviews on here about the leggings being too short or showing &#34;all the curves&#34; a bit too much. I can't personally attest to that, but with my body type, I'd say it's just a bit too long for me. However, for $4/legging, I'm willing to toss around my closet a bit to wear these pants in a flattering way."
4.0,"They were too small for my head. I really like the design, and, fortunately, they fit my gf well."
4.0,Really gives you cleavage but I feel like it runs small.
4.0,Extra pocket for iPhone is especially good .
4.0,Perfect fit shirt. The cloth is little thick and not wrinkle proof but Overall it is good shirt 👍
4.0,"Pretty, good solid quality, looks even better in reality."
4.0,"Nice & satiny. wish it ""popped"" in person as much as on computer, but still nice."
4.0,they are great I use them at work and at home.  Thank You
4.0,This shirt is cute and comfy. It's lightweight and the colors are really bright. Love it. Would strongly suggest purchasing it.
4.0,Works well even with a broken clip.  It broke the first time I opened it.
4.0,"It will darken your leather and yes it will soften it. Requires very little to do a fine job. My first experience with it and I over softened the leather, but that's my fault. It will darken your leather quite a bit, so if you use it on a really dark brown or black, it'll be perfect. I would try it on a scrap of light leather first to see if it's ok."
4.0,stud on one earring was damaged by being bent
4.0,"Fits and looks great for a bikini bottom cover.  We travel to beach other resorts, this is a very nice addition for my wife to have."
4.0,Received this hat last night and wore it for the first time today. Actually like this hat fit perfectly and kept my ears warm.
4.0,Ordered my regular size of a medium.  Bottoms fit well...top is a bit tighter than I would like.  Print is pretty.  Very soft.  Just wish top was a bit larger.
4.0,I like that hat but it is a tight fit. The earrings always fall out so I’ll have to buy some backs to secure it.
4.0,"The pattern on this dress is gorgeous and the material is really nice. It fits as expected, maybe a little boxy, through the body, but is much shorter than expected. I'm 5'1&#34; 110lbs and it was almost uncomfortably short to wear to work. It's really pretty, so I'm definitely keeping it, but probably won't wear it to my office again and will reserve for fun events in the summer."
4.0,"My husband absolutely loves this robe but wishes the ties were just a little bit lower, if we could give 4.5 stars we would.  The color red is beautiful and the pictures don't do it it justice. The satin is nice and smooth and perfect for warmer weather to have a robe that isn't overly bulky. My husband likes it because he has a hard time finding robes that have long enough arms and this falls just perfect.<br />He is a size large, 5'11, 175 lbs with a 34-36&#34; waist. I would say a fairly average build. I received this item free in exchange for an honest,  unbiased review. I was not compensated in any other way."
4.0,Standard material quality you'd get in a Tj maxx or run of the mill women's clothing store. Zipper closes and opens nicely. Long cross body strap in addition to a short shoulder strap. Will need to flatten out the strap fold indentations from packing with a heavy book.overall good purchase
4.0,Cute watch.
4.0,for the price its nice and since i wanted a cheaper hat i could decorate for race day this will be perfect. the bow is just hot glued on and you know it with the glue exposed. but since i am adding my own flare no worries. the chin strap is nice and easy to just stuff up in the hat if you are like me and not going to be using. i got the blue and its pretty true to color
4.0,"I love this style of dress but this one doesn’t stretch as much as other brands. The top is more sheer than others. It faded after one wash. The print is gorgeous. It’s a tiny bit snug, too."
4.0,The shoes look great and well built but they seems to run a little big
4.0,"Would be perfect for a summer wedding.  lovely swing skirt which fell a little below the knee, but unfortunately I returned it because I was looking to wear it to a November wedding and the sleeves were too short for me.  Would buy again if sleeves were to the elbow."
4.0,Beautiful... nice hold
4.0,"I am a I cup and these don't go that far, but the F cup works, just a little more snug."
4.0,"Adorable cut. Perfect for the office, to after hour cocktails. Made incredibly well. Fits to your true size. Washes well. Must have dress."
4.0,These are a good deal if you want nice sunglasses but lose or break them easily. They are pretty thin and flexible. The only downside is that they came to be crooked and i couldn't straighten them out on my face without breaking.
4.0,These shorts are super cute! The fabric isn't the most breathable but it is soft.
4.0,Gloves are great but these are too small
4.0,These are beautiful but very small.
4.0,Very oversized to cover your face. However it is a little weak. you get what you pay for right?
4.0,Good product. They keep my hubby hands warm and dry. Highly recommended!
4.0,Slim elegant products
4.0,I have curly hair and I use this to control frizz while I sleep. It works although not as a head scarf because it comes off of my head too easily.
4.0,Surprisingly good quality for the price!! Even the chain I received wasn't flimsy. I've worn these necklaces every day since I got them (about a month ago) and they are holding up fine. Very happy with them!
4.0,"It was nicely made, not cheap at all.  Excited to now go and see the Globe Trotters with my Son.:)"
4.0,"I ordered these gloves for my son for Christmas b/c he's always complaining that his hands are cold.  He absolutely loves these gloves.  The only reason why I didn't give it a 5th star is because even though I ordered these gloves 2 weeks before Christmas they didn't come until after New Years, so I was really disappointed about that."
4.0,They necklace is exactly how it looks in the picture. It's kind of small but that's how I wanted it. Be careful when handling it though because the charm will slide off easily.
4.0,"The lenses are darker on the top than the bottom and the color of the lenses changes with the transition<br />to the lighter bottom of the lenses. They are nice glasses and seem to have a multicolored appearance<br />when viewed by someone else that's looking at you, If you want these glasses as they're described as<br />black, these aren't the glasses for you. I wanted dark glasses, but still like them a lot."
4.0,These aren't what I expected and took way too long to receive. I wish we would be warned it was coming from China
4.0,I think it will work
4.0,Good quality - fits tight on my head. Only reason I gave it 4 stars
4.0,I love the belt!!!
4.0,"I love that it holds 2 pair of glasses, I wish there was room to hold the eye glass cleaner rag and spray.  I always keep my glasses cleans<br />O"
4.0,I t nice but too short
4.0,"Exactly what I needed: an attractive, easy to use, soft case to carry my reading glasses in my purse. I have full size glasses and they fit beautifully; Even enough room for a cleaning cloth. It has a strong leather smell at first, but it dissipates quickly. I ordered the brown/burgundy/rust color and it is just as pictured - I would describe it as mahogany."
4.0,"Pants are comfortable, great price and doesn't quite resemble the look from the picture but similar."
4.0,Love it in the front.....absolutely perfect. It has an overlay in front and not in back which is fine I'd just prefer the back to be looser. It's more fitted than I imagined.
4.0,I liked very much. I use it to wear when I go out
4.0,"These socks are adorable but one pair was oddly smaller than the rest. Otherwise, very happy and my toddler enjoys making a matching game out of them when doing laundry!"
4.0,It needs a different chain.
4.0,"Pretty nice quality fabric material used, definitely not “costume like” cheap material as many other private brands sell. I think it’s worth the price but I would go down a size, I bought a medium- you can’t tell it’s big because it’s flowy but I could have purchased a small and it would have looked slightly better."
4.0,Very nice!  Lightweight Comfortable
4.0,I’m a plumber and use these gloves daily. Each pair lasts about a month which sucks because they’re expensive but i have to have them! I only took a star because of the price.
4.0,I LOVE MY GLASSES VERY CUTE GOT LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS
4.0,This is a beautiful purse.  I haven't used it yet.
4.0,"Love the glasses, however very fragile and seem like they can break easily."
4.0,"This bathing suit is SO cute and fits very well. The only issue is the built-in bra is pretty small and doesn't cover my DDs. I even got a size larger than I normally do based on other reviews. The material feels a little cheap, but I don't go swimming very often so I'm not worried about that."
4.0,Really nice shirt but thin material so only good for summer. Runs a tad small.
4.0,Nice costume hat
4.0,"Cute, runs large."
4.0,A little thinner material than I thought it would be
4.0,"It's not as open/sheer as the listing makes it appear, but that's okay. The zipper is the reason I took a star away. It's so difficult to use, it's even hard to put on a mannequin. Worth it tho."
4.0,"The dress is beautiful and soft. It was to large though compared to its stated measurements so I exchanged it for a size medium, which is my usual size, and now it's perfect!"
4.0,"As described, looks good. My boy likes them, but they run a little small."
4.0,"Idk what they were so expensive. It’s basically paper but cuter? Nothing wrong with them, but the ad makes them appear much more sturdy"
4.0,i love the ring it was the right size that i had ordered
4.0,"The item description says ""Slouchy"" leg warmers, but they are actually a snug fit on my skinny calves. Possible they'll stretch out and become slouchy over time? They are warm and cozy and I found that I can wear them in my boots like a boot sock would fit."
4.0,Did it’s job!!
4.0,Very lightweight summer dress. Shrank the first time i washed it which was a little bit of a bummer but still pretty comfortable
4.0,"This tank has a fun and interesting style. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. It's a tunic length, so it goes with lots of pants. I found the fit to be true to size. You can sizedown for a more fitted look.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
4.0,"The backings that I originally received were terrible.  I lost them both in a very short amount of time but luckily didn't lose the pearls (which are GREAT by the way).  The Pearl Source worked with me and was GREAT about sending me replacement backings that are tighter - have had them for a little over a months now and they haven't fallen off.  Overall, great customer service!"
4.0,Only reason is did not get 5 stars is that the sleeves feel a bit tight in the lower arm area and it is difficult to pull them up.<br />But otherwise comfortable. Very warm
4.0,These are great for keys but better for something you wish to secure longer term.
4.0,beads are small. I was expecting it to be stretchy but it was not. I can barely get it on so be warned.
4.0,The hat is very comfortable. Only disaapointment is that Peet’s Coffee & Tea is not stitched lettering.
4.0,"Fit as expected, glad they have a drawstring since my waist is smaller then my thighs"
4.0,I was pleased with the product
4.0,Beads are purple/brown (hinting of burgundy and copper). I like the versatility of the color. Snugly beaded so feels substantial. Definitely like the lobster clips holding the elastic ends as I want to change the elastic ends out right away. The elastic ends that came on it are too stretchy and have slid too easily along the frame.  The elastic ends are the only reason I gave this product a 4 star instead of 5 star rating.
4.0,"This is a cute choker, very BoHo and comfortable to wear without any pinching. Adjusted nicely to fit my big neck."
4.0,Nice and roomy and I really like the look.
4.0,"Arrived 2 weeks ahead of the estimate. Great color, solid build. I've only worn them once, but they seem to be good quality."
4.0,Cute and good fit but they do ride up while cycling
4.0,"They are gorgeous, but a lil bit wide for my 🦶. Not too comfortable for a long wear"
4.0,I found that for the price are pretty
4.0,Runs snall
4.0,I got an xl and it fit just fine.<br />The fabric is hard it is what it is for less than 10 bucks. I bought it for vegas and its pretty comfy<br />Its cute and if you have a big butt like me then you will have plenty of room
4.0,"Didn't have the stones on the body of the gown but other than that, I am very pleased."
4.0,"These are great scarves. Period. Especially for the money. HOWEVER, I bought the green one that is almost an exact knock off from Hermes as it shows in the picture and aw shucks, it doesn't have the same lettering and labels. So just beware that the picture is accurate but it may not have some of the specific details that are in the graphic like the wording or phrases you may get on a genuine Hermes. Oh well... :)"
4.0,"This is a nice shirt for fitting.  My husband has broad shoulders and the XL fit nicely.  The fabric is very thin, not as sturdy as the more expensive brands, but I bought this for him for casual wear in the summer, so it is cool.  His only complaint is the very small velcro on the front pocket flaps, but overall pleased with the purchase for the price and purpose."
4.0,Great product. Had a issue at first but the seller quickly resolved the issue. I love the movement.and it keeps good time.
4.0,"The lapel was a bit too shiny for my liking, but otherwise it was as-advertised"
4.0,They fit as expected but have a tendency to stretch out around the waist and hips and look baggy.  Throw them in the wash and they shrink back to size.
4.0,"Very cute... pear shaped lady here, 36-31-41, and it feels very comfortable and flattering.  Full coverage if you are blessed with a generously sized bottom ;)"
4.0,Plenty of room! I normally wear XL in most tops and this one still had plenty of room.  If you want a tighter fit I'd suggest a size down.  Material is slick. Buttons are cute.
4.0,I have multiple piercings and wanted some small earrings to wear.  These small earrings were perfect for just the right amount of color and size.  I've had several comments on the look.
4.0,"Cute! The tassel is a bit stiff and awkward .. doesn’t drape naturally, and the mustard color is very bold - difficult to find clothing that matches it. Not neutral at all. But cute and unique style."
4.0,"I really love the dress. I ordered a size small and I am going to wear it to my graduation. It was a little bigger than I expected, but I am very tiny. I will probably get it altered in the shoulders and waist and little. However it is beautiful and great quality."
4.0,"I ordered the brown pair, loved the look and the fit was spectacular!  They were more comfortable than all my designer sunglasses actually.  But the brown lenses were far too light for Southern summers.  I returned them and ordered the black pair.  Will update my review when they come in!"
4.0,It only has one pocket. Others I have gotten have two. A little disappointing
4.0,It's very cute but I ordered a medium and was sent a large. So back it goes.
4.0,"very cute, but WAY too small"
4.0,You can tell it's fake when you look at it. Very pretty ring tho.
4.0,Even though they are inexpensive I was impressed with the overall quality.  The only complaint is they are a bit more distracting to look through than I had hoped
4.0,Very pleasantly surprised how nice it was for the price.  My wife actually wears it.
4.0,"These are so cute! They are also very comfortable and stay on pretty well. I have had one snap as soon as I put it on and a stone fell out of one, but The price is so reasonable, I’m ordering some more.  Love them!"
4.0,I like the fabric and the fit. I just dont care for the prints at the back of the panties.
4.0,"They are really cute, so I'll just keep them and have the baby grow into them. The tipoff should have been the large age range."
4.0,I ordered a size smaller due to the comments about it running large. I’m 5’7’’ and about 160 lbs and it fit perfectly! The zipper is tricky but still functional.
4.0,"When it first came, I was blessed with the energy that it was giving. I was also really happy with the Usage Card and bag. But I was disappointing about two things -<br /><br />1. The lob (crystal ball) at the end of the chain was not there!<br />2. The chain was too long.<br /><br />I guess that you can't really blame them about the chain, but the fact that there was no lob was very disappointing. But I will buy from this seller soon."
4.0,Great product. I love it
4.0,"These shorts are a thin material but they are very comfortable and perfect for lounging around, sleeping, or even wearing over your swim suit. They fit true to size and hold up well after washing. They come with a couple of white butterfly decals and I think I would like the shorts better without that feature. But overall, these are good casual shorts to lounge around in."
4.0,"They look exactly as advertised, but they are quite heavy :(<br />still recommend though if you're just taking pictures."
4.0,It hangs a little short but I love it.
4.0,"It is adorable, but do not buy if you have a big chest - above a c cup."
4.0,"After a couple years of wear, it is pretty scratched up. For the price, it's absolutely worth it to me. My husband is not gentle with it and it shows, but it hasn't broken. It's been dropped many times and no shattering. I'd even consider replacing it with the same ring at some point."
4.0,"see my comments on same watch but with red face...... i'd rate it 3.5 stars. a bit clunky and not that shiny.... .all-in-all ok, but i might not have bought it if i'd showroomed it first.<br /><br />EDIT: revising to 4 stars... liking it more with time......... guess disappointment that it doesn't look as good as its photo on amazon. but that's true of all jewelry i think"
4.0,This is a great one
4.0,"This is a cute outfit but the zipper is shorter than desired. The zipper stops at the top of baby's leg instead of farther down so it is difficult to get baby's leg out comfortably while not having the zipper scratch his leg trying to squeeze it though. The solution may be to size up but it would still be a bit of a nuisance. Again, style-wise, pretty cute though"
4.0,These shoes are helpful for back and leg pain.  They're comfortable to wear and the option of using the supplied fillers is amazing since both of my feet aren't the same.  Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they are not that easy to get your feet into.  Hoping that gets easier as they get broken in.
4.0,"I actually love these. They're exactly what I've been looking for, as I have 8 holes in my ears. The only reason I'm taking away a star is because when I recieved them, I found that they are actually a gauge larger than your typical earrings. So in order to wear them I actually had to take a size 18 gauging needle to each hole. If it does specify anywhere that these are 18g, it wasn't anywhere highly visible."
4.0,"Nice dolly, works well but had to have McGiver figure out how to fasten it to my kayak. 12 foot included strap worthless"
4.0,"I really like the top.  I love the color.  I'm a medium, that's what I bought and it fits nicely.  What I don't like about it is it's very long in the front.  I wish it was the same length as the back.  It's not a huge problem because I just scrunch it up to where I want it and it stays put."
4.0,"The stone color was a bright blue, as pictured, and the silver fittings seemed to be good quality as well. I was surprised at how small the stones were -- smaller than they appear in the picture."
4.0,"with a cute pair of high waisted jeans or shorts, its perf."
4.0,My son likes it but unfortunately runs small. My son wears size 5 and I ordered size 6 but it was too small.
4.0,The bag is beautiful. The colors are rich and vibrant. However I did not read the dimensions correctly & thought it would be bigger. My mistake not the sellers. I would love this in a much larger bag.
4.0,The color is so strong. But the bottle dried so fast
4.0,Its adorable but I would probably order up a size- I wear it with jeans and have gotten lots of compliments on it-  Definitely buy if you like Betty Page
4.0,"Very cute bra and amazingly comfortable! It feels like you arent wearing anything! There wasnt too much support (which I expected from a bralette. The wine is slightly more purple (more the color of pomegrant juice) in person. Still a gorgeous color. My only worry is the mesh material on the edges. They dont appear to be finished ends, which makes me think they will fray pretty quickly. Im overall happy with my purchase and the price!"
4.0,I really like the fit of this top. I ordered it a size larger to not fit too tight across the mid section. The fabric is nice. I’m going to enjoying wearing this top.
4.0,Love this bag! Super cute and fits lots of stuff. Perfect for me as I am a toddler mom that carries lots of extra stuff. I will say that the metal part on the zipper came off very easily which is why I'm only giving four stars. I just got some super glue and it's all good now.
4.0,The tie is great! I returned it for the longer version and it looks awesome!. Amazon on the other hand is dreadful to work with when returning something. I have spent 3 hours of my life trying to get a return authorization for the shorter version through their system and haven't been successful yet. For that reason I won't be buying much from them in the future. But the tie is awesome (find somewhere else to purchase them).
4.0,I got this for my daughter in law who is a size medium on top and large on bottom.I ordered the size large and it looks great on her.
4.0,I did review this dress before but now after Wearing it !? I would like to say that I love it. Got so many compliments all evening. ❤️
4.0,"I usually buy an extra small to a small, and I bought these in size small and they were definitely more on the snug side! They do not, however, fit too snugly to be uncomfortable. If you go between two sizes, definitely get the bigger size."
4.0,"It’s slouchy, but I feel like it was made for slightly shorter girls. My 2.5 year old is in the 4-5t and the front bib part hangs lower than I’d like to cover her chest. It’s also like capris on the bottom, it’s cute, but she’ll grow out of it quickly, I think! She’s 34.5lbs and 3’1"
4.0,Its dark and hard to see the actual design
4.0,"Love it, looks more expensive than it was !!"
4.0,Love this tunic!  So comfortable and the length is great. I did have to take it in in top to fit better. I will order a size smaller next time.
4.0,"My other watch needed a battery but don't have anybody local, so I just went for a new watch,<br />it is much nicer than any thing from a big box store"
4.0,Received on time. Looks good and perfectly for the size. Want to order another one.
4.0,Useful for hot days.
4.0,clasps are a little tricky.  But they are beautiful!
4.0,"Beautiful color. Little to wide,  even for my big head :-) keep falling down my face."
4.0,Good quality for he price
4.0,I enjoyed the color combination with my skin tone and the quality of craftsmanship.
4.0,"These white women's casual women's office work pants are elegant and presentable. These pants look very nice, but I would say take care when it comes to washing these pants."
4.0,Usually wear 12w. The 12 fits just fine. Little snug but will break in. Grip is great. Insole has these bumps like a little foot massage thing going on. Wore them on the bike and these are good. No slipping on floorboards. Pleasantly surprised with them so far.
4.0,"I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br />This is a small cross-body bag with shallow sections so it is very good for holding your cards, a passport and your ID. If that's all you need it will work for every day. I have trouble fitting my iPhone covered in a tough cover in the pockets do I have to use the biggest main section which is slightly bigger than the phone. My key chain is too bulky and does not fit."
4.0,Like it comfy but sizes do run on small side
4.0,"They're super cute and I love the quality. I had ordered a size medium originally and I felt that they were too big, so I returned them for a small but now the small is, well..too small. But I think it's more me than them. I have wide set eyes, so if there was some sort of magical way to make the bridge of the glasses wider rather than the lenses larger, than they'd be perfect. Oh well! Chances are I'll end up buying the medium ones again as I prefer them to be a bit large as opposed to too small."
4.0,"Simple yet stylish, not too flashy, comfortable, easy to tie, runs a little short, but can be adjusted."
4.0,Decent quality for the price. I like it. Plenty of complement s.
4.0,"Cute but not as thick or flowy as pictured, size medium"
4.0,So far so good. Read washing instructions but stands up to a standard machine cycle.
4.0,"I got this item free from Amazon to rate the product!  It is a beautiful shade of blue and super cute. The rim is really soft and floppy and would be excellent for the beach. Well made with intricate stitching. It is a very large hat so if you do not like big hats this would not be for you, however if you are sensitive to the sun this is an excellent way to keep the sun off of you!"
4.0,I love this brand of glasses and the look of them. However on the side there is a mfg defect in the frame. Sad but I will still use them.
4.0,I love the look of these socks and they seem to do the job well. Better than a multipack I got in a lower compression. They are fairly thin.<br />Con- the ecg pattern stays on my legs for a while after I take the socks off. Next time I will try a solid pattern sock.<br />The thin sock does not absorb at all for those of us with sweaty feet. I have memory foam shoes contributing to this problem.<br />These socks would be better if I were sitting all day rather than standing and running around all day.
4.0,Gave it a 4 because top is too big. I ordered a size M. Besides that Great top very cute. I did contact seller they were very nice and helpful.<br />Thank you.
4.0,"Short and wide. Otherwise, cute."
4.0,"This briefcase is great looking and well-made. I love the deep black color, leather edges, and leather handles. The shoulder strap top is leather, padded and removable. The zipper is heavy duty. For the price, this is an excellent choice."
4.0,Great quality and fits like a true small.
4.0,It’s very nice and clever but my complaints are is the left side is bent by a little and that I don’t really use it that much but very nice indeed
4.0,Clips feel rather soft and easily breakable if luggage is dropped during handling
4.0,"This is a very lovely dress. I don't recommend for women with larger busts, because the buttons on the bodice kept popping open for me."
4.0,I have been having difficulty finding dresses that fit me because I am a Small-Medium but have a DDD chest.  This dress has a stretchier material which felt great and allowed me to get the dress in the size I needed because the chest was able to stretch out some.  Other dresses in the same cut but by other companies were made out of different material and did not fit me even in larger sizes.
4.0,This dress is so comfortable I sometimes sleep in it for pajamas a sadly and does not have pockets like the olive green dress has
4.0,Husband very pleased with it. Right emblem.
4.0,"Very awesome watch; very masculine - very macho.  This is my most complicated watch to date.  I just got it today, so I still have yet to learn how to use all of its features.<br /><br />One thing that I really like about I watch this complicated is the fact that the second hand for the time is not on a sub dial.<br /><br />The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the uselessness of one of the sub dials - it's the one to the upper right hand corner of the dial.  It's meant to be able to give you military / 24 hour time - however, there are no numbers or any other markers other than 24 on it."
4.0,"Like shape, not finish, and it is too big for me, difficult for me to reduce wrist size."
4.0,"I ordered these vests for the guys in my wedding. I think the sizes are a little off. The bigger the size goes, the further off it is. I ordered 5 vests and one of them was not the same type as the rest. It only had three buttons, instead of five and it was a slightly different shade of grey. I just kept it because you could barely tell the difference when all the guys were standing together in pictures."
4.0,Loved it Wore it for a Halloween party  I ordered an xxl which I usually can wear l or xl. It was still pretty snug but I think if I went up another size the top part may have not fit right.  I really liked it though. Wore web leggings  and accessories  Everyone liked it also
4.0,One off the best compressions socks I have used
4.0,"Beautifull necklace ....for the price looks great feel good and would recommend it to buy the necklace,,,,"
4.0,"MUCH smaller than I thought it'd be. But, incredibly easy to use. Built in stopwatch helps with workouts, and even has an alarm, which I was not expecting.<br /><br />Be warned. If you have big wrists, you will definitely need to look elsewhere."
4.0,love these glasses. one of the nose peices was bent a little making the glasses uneven but not bad enough to send them back. cant wait to use them!
4.0,Love the shirt but it definitely runs small. I wear a L/XL and had to order an 8xl. It's still small through the chest.
4.0,"These suits are so cute and modest. I wore this off a cruise ship for a day of sightseeing and swimming. After a lot of wears though, the skirt part had stretched to so long, it was past my knees when wet. Also the suit lost it's color and faded. Also one of the seems opened in the back.Thank goodness for the skirt, lol. If you don't swim all that much and just want to hang out by a pool or beach and give it light use, it's a great choice for anyone looking for a modest but modern suit. It is really cute.<br />I think if I had taken better care to wash it in chlorine removal stuff and not used the dryer etc. It would have lasted better. I liked it enough to buy another and I'm going to see if taking care of it better and light use make a difference."
4.0,"I don't normally tend towards a combo of stripes and floral for outfits, but I particularly liked the floral design/coloring on these. The fabric is a stretchy jersey."
4.0,Great fabric. Just fit perfectly
4.0,"This took at least a month to get to me after I ordered it. Fits great, love the pockets, but I'm a bit disgruntled at the extended shipping time."
4.0,Love the star but the chain has a weird smell
4.0,Bought it to go with a scarf necklace I have.  It looks similar to the wings on the scarf necklace.
4.0,"These are great studs! Even though the listing is noted for men, I bought this set for myself. I read the gauge size wrong and realized my mistake when I put the earrings on for the first time. I stretched my ear. It did sting but I wore them for a week and the earrings didn't make my ears infected or any other negative side effect. I really like that the backing screws on too.<br /><br />3 Color Wood Stud Earrings Set, Choosing Different Color to Match Your Daily Outfit.<br />- They go with everything! I was able to wear a pair every day of the week. Though I did notice that the birch wood set blended in with my skin tone and looked as though I didn't have any earrings on.<br /><br />Special Ear Plugs with Stylish Wood Pattern, Light Weight, Comfortable to Wear.<br />- They are very light weight. Had I not accidentally stretched my earlobes, I would have forgotten they were on!<br /><br />Size: Gague Size: 1mm=18G, Standard Gague Size for Average Men and Women.

I have busy mornings and paying close attention to my earrings when I put them on is not always an option.<br /><br />Made of 316L Stainless Steel, Hypoallergenic and Healthy.<br />- They are hypoallergenic!

However this does not have any impact on my statements above."
4.0,Larger than expected. Nice quality.
4.0,"Son loves it, but it runs a little small. I thought I was buying it big so he had room to grow in it but it just barely fits now."
4.0,Not as long as appears in picture
4.0,loved these tights. Vibrant color and just fun to wear. I am 139 lbs and 5'5&#34; tall and they were a tad bit small but overall I was pleased with them.
4.0,Very warm. Fits good. Haven't tested water resistance but it's a nice comfy hat for cold days
4.0,The hair isnt a textured look like in the picture. Its more like glitter covered in a thick plastic. I gave this four stars only because i can work with it<br /> I guess.
4.0,"Prettier than I expected, looks great with a wide range of blues and neutrals.  I did have to contact the seller for a missing connection piece that originally made the necklace unwearable/broken, but the issue was solved expediently."
4.0,"It is slightly uncomfortable because of how thick it is, and i am hesitant to wear because of fear that the blue stripes will rub off but other than that i love it"
4.0,For some reason this mask came soaking wet. Nothing else in the order was wet just this.<br />Fits well.
4.0,The bouquet was purchased for a costume. The flowers were a little smashed upon opening the package but could be adjusted.
4.0,I used the product as a gift.
4.0,"This is by far the best belt I have ever owned. It adjust so easily and is fully automatic. I have gotten a few compliments on the look and even have had someone ask me where they can get 1 or 2 of them. I enjoy the feel and comfort of it. No more worries about the darn pin or buckle breaking or coming loose.<br /><br />******UPDATE****** The Buckle fell off and on trying to put it back on the belt,I noticed that the teeth had damaged the leather and the only way I could put it back on was to cut it. Now the buckle continues to fall off every month or so it seems. I am taking a point away because of this. I have no idea if I can just get another belt to use with the buckle as it needs to have ridges on the buckle end. Will update again to fill you in on finding a replacement and where."
4.0,"Daupanzees long-sleeved gold embroidered adds a bit of elegance and splash to the classic black dress shirt. The shirt is made of 100% cotton which allows it to hold deep black dyes better than materials such as polyester. It is machine washable and can be dried in a machine as well but I often let mine air dry to preserve the color.<br /><br />What I like most about this shirt is:<br />- The golden embroidery luxury designed mandarin collar. This breaks up the all-black design with a tasteful but unique aesthetic<br />- Length. The length allows this shirt to be worn either tucked or untucked and look great either way.<br /><br />What I liked least about this shirt is:<br />- Slim fit design. I know slim fitting items are all the rage but it makes finding the right size challenging. I found the sizing chart that is pictured with this shirt neither accurate nor helpful.<br /><br />Overall, Daupanzees offers an inexpensive shirt that looks and feels good. It's versatile enough to be tucked in and worn with dress clothing yet can be untucked and worn with a pair of jeans. It looks great either way. My only gripe was with sizing. Slim fit shirts are notoriously difficult for me to size and this one was no different. Still, it's a very nice shirt if you can nail one in your size."
4.0,Got right
4.0,Beautiful but runs a little small.
4.0,"These waist extenders work very well for me.  I have used them for about 1.5 years  to enable extending the waist size of my 34"" pants to 36"".  I could go to a 38"" by using the end-most button hole but haven't needed to.  The extension is especially helpful when winter comes and I am tucking a flannel shirt and t-shirt under the waist band of the pants rather than just a light summer shirt.  The extenders are mostly hidden by my belt but, since I wear a lot of khaki and beige slacks, the extenders are not too noticeable if they do show below the belt a little.  The only downside is that they tend to fray if washed.  But I have stopped washing them -- no need to since they are covered and do not get dirty with either external dirt or body oil."
4.0,The softest burp cloths I have found. They are cozy to the touch and are still absorbent which is a must. A little on the pricey side for 3 but the quality is worth it for sure.
4.0,"I love the color and the softness of it and it fits perfect. It's a little bit on the &#34;thin&#34; side, however.  I still like it"
4.0,"Love this band, but it broke."
4.0,I love to wear these as a helmet liner or just to keep warm as a beanie or neck warmer. They're thin and stretchy but still keep you pretty warm in moderately cold weather. Seem to be made well. I appreciate they come in neutral colors as well as designs.
4.0,"these are the same SteelTime earrings i purchased from another seller last year, except these aren't bent as those were.  however, the pincatch on one earring is very tight, and hard to close.  because they are stainless steel, this is hard to correct.  can't seem to get it right with these earrings."
4.0,"Looks just like the..picture., beautiful red ..fits comfortably 👍🏻"
4.0,These earrings are more impressive on the model in the picture. The model appears larger and chuckier  than in person. I consider these earrings a knock-off Bali replica. After wearing these earrings all day and sleeping in them I reconsidered from 2 stars to 4 stars. They are very comfortable and my son the critic liked them.
4.0,My granddaughter loves them. That's good enough for me
4.0,Love it. Just the the perfect size. Would highly recommend..
4.0,I am sure my sister will like it.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, fits your curves perfectly"
4.0,One of the small jewels came lose and was lost within first couple weeks of wearing.
4.0,"These are great leggings, and I wish they were still available so I could get another pair! 4 stars simply bc the material isn’t as thick as some of my other athletic leggings, but they are still great quality (and a great price!)"
4.0,"After I sewed up the side seams 4&#34; so it wasn't like a tent, I love it."
4.0,"Flimsy, but very nice MATTE texture"
4.0,"These glasses were a little better than expected.  They are are actually made pretty well and are fairly substantial for the price.  I bought them for a costume party, so I will wear them very seldom.  They are excellent for my purpose.."
4.0,This is a good quality bag and all works well. Recommended buy.
4.0,Color and quality was great. The knots on the straps bugged my kids ears more than other masks.
4.0,"The jumpsuit fits pretty well, but I might be a tiny bit too tall for it because it kind of pulls at the crotch (I am 5'6"" and got a large). It looks like the picture, fabric seems to be good quality."
4.0,"It you have long and thick hair,  it is hard to close firmly,  but overall hat is as described."
4.0,"Attractive carrier, but somewhat small."
4.0,"Unfortunately I can't wear this dress as it is too short for me, but I'm 5'11 with big hips so it does happen with me with dresses from time to time. It's hard for me to wear short dresses. I was hoping based on the model picture that it would be a little bit longer but unfortunately not. I have the same dress from the same brand in the longer, midi length version and quite like it. The material is soft and I love the tie detail, but it can come off slightly matronly."
4.0,"I was frankly shocked that these were indeed genuine leather, considering the ridiculously low cost, but so far I have found no fault in them. It takes a while to ship from China, but definitely worth the wait."
4.0,"I know this is just a rubber ring, but it scuffed up very quickly.<br />Overall great and true to size."
4.0,"i dont get to wear this bracelet alot but when i do i get compliments on it. the rhinestones fall out however, hence why i dont wear it alot"
4.0,The price was reasonable and I love the color options that they had
4.0,I ordered this along with 3 men's bibs as a joke for our upcoming cruise.  They are well made and will definitely serve the purpose!  Nice that they are washable!
4.0,I thought I like this dress but for some reason I just couldn’t get with it. Probably because of my bust
4.0,"Cheap jet ski glasses.  If lost, no great loss."
4.0,Great costume for my kid
4.0,"The gloves are nice, used washing dishes.  The gloves need to be longer they come to my wrist."
4.0,"Comfortable, work well, look good. Only problem I had is the lens popped out after a month. Not bad for the price"
4.0,Bought this for a belle Halloween costume and ordered a large which was a little tight in the chest with a shirt underneath but would probably be fine on its own.  The dress was flattering but seemed pretty cheaply made. The thread at seams was loose in some spots but it was not noticeable to anyone else but me.
4.0,I normally wear a medium shirt and that is what I bought and it fits just right. The color is as pictured. I like the shirt and am happy with the purchase.
4.0,"I like it fine, haven’t worn it yet. Will add more when I do."
4.0,Half a size too big but still Great quality and look really good!
4.0,"Appears to be nice material and is comfortable. I wear a 34DD and the large runs a little small. No complaints about the suit, just cheeky as expected."
4.0,Perfect size. It's large enough to wrap my hair and soft to the touch so feels great. Plus it stays on my head. I will order other colors.
4.0,"These are pretty huge on my face. They came in a nice and sturdy box with a cleaning cloth. Oh, and the cleaning cloth was a $100 bills printed cloth which I found comical. The frames are a thick plastic and a pleasant color. I just wish the frames weren’t so large."
4.0,It shrunk a bit after the first wash.
4.0,"I really like the quality of these pants; soft and not see through. They were very light in color- different than the product photo- and are also mid shin length (I am about 5'4, so not overly tall)."
4.0,Slightly low cut (the robe part I mean) I expected the nightgown underneath to be loose on the breasts and allow for easy feeding. But I was hoping the robe portion would be a bit more modest. But the fabric is SUPER SOFT and STRETCHY and the robe ties are attached (which I love...kind of a pain when you wash things and have to go looking for the robe tie or untangle it from around your bra straps when you pull from the washing machine)
4.0,The hoop is great but the dangling heart probably works better for the ear. I tries to wear it in my septum and the heart was annoying. Took the heart off and it was perfect.
4.0,I feel like a ninja wearing this on the court lol.<br />Its great and does its job. The only thing is you do have to wash it after every use and let it dry. Which is to be expected for something so lightweight.
4.0,This bag is well made but I ordered the black and it looks like a deep blue with bronze strap.  This bag is much smaller than I imagined but it will do for now.  Would not purchase again just because it only holds the essentials.
4.0,Does run smaller than chart says. It's also a sweater I didnt realize that till I got it.
4.0,got what i paid for
4.0,Not what I anticipated but okay!
4.0,"The colors or as expected, and very vibrant"
4.0,No quedo en el dorso como en la foto. El estilo no es tan acampanado como muestra la imagen.
4.0,Much easier to deal with than clip ons!
4.0,"Helps very significantly with the painful blue light, it basically removes most of the blue light so if you're sensitive to it, these are a good choice. However the hinge on one side is pretty loose, but that's easy enough to fix."
4.0,Cute and different.  Arrive slight scratched on matte frame but will keep.
4.0,"Very nice comfort and material. I've tried quite a few different natos and these rank near the top. Hadley roma is my favorite, but not a lot of color combinations"
4.0,Its nice looks great just a little to thin for me
4.0,They fit as sized and are extremely comfortable
4.0,"fast shipping, very nice belt and a punch for making extra holes if you need them"
4.0,Liquid Blue is known for quality. This blanket is proof.
4.0,Bought this as an anniversary gift for my wife. Came on time was as advertised. She is tall 5 foot 11 and it fit perfectly.
4.0,Correct size and comfortable. Good price!
4.0,I thought these were solid material throughout but they have an adjustable section. I like.
4.0,"Good quality, soft fabric, comfortable, just didn't have the fit I was going for so I returned."
4.0,"These sleeves seem fine, I needed white for an all white clothing rule for tennis. They do the trick."
4.0,"A little smaller than expected. I am 5'4 and 100lbs and the small fit around me just fine, but was a little short in the arms, and too short to tuck in. So if you're are tallish, get a medium or larger. Otherwise, this is a great shirt! Fabric is thick and durable. I wear it as a business casual for work."
4.0,Not big boy friendly have to be in great shape to use this
4.0,"I ordered large, but apparently in every other brand I’m a large and with these I’m an XL. Large will Still fit, but tighter than I’m accustomed to with other brands."
4.0,These are light weight and warm.  I doubt that they have any water repellent properties though. But they would be great for wear under a pair of light weight gore tex rain pants.  The fit was very good. The waist has plenty of elastic to expand if needed.  Good reasonable price.
4.0,Not true to size but very cute. I bought it for my 4 year old. I wish they had my size! 🤔
4.0,"i have to ride through (another) hurricane to really test these, but i am happy just having these as part of my permanent rain gear. they seem to be very well built and quality product.<br /><br />Thick, quality rubber soles do appear to be solid and love lasting. Reinforced stitching and Taped seems should keep out the rain out and your dogs Dry<br /><br />Reflective highway patches in silver should help increase visibility<br /><br />Would recommend and would buy again. I will add another star after my next ride through a super-cell"
4.0,"Product is fantastic and I was really surprised with having asthma how well it helped me to breathe outside of the heat. I use mine to keep an eye out for patients at my job. The only one complaint I had was that it does not stop fog on the glasses if you get hot while wearing it because it starts sliding down your skin little bit but, other than that everything's been amazing and I would definitely recommend this mask to anybody."
4.0,Beautiful dress. Just make sure that you order at least one or two sizes larger than you normally wear.
4.0,"I'm 5'6"" and  a DDD. It is very cute, comfortable and flattering except it's really long.  I wasnt expecting it to come to my mid thigh. I read all the reviews before I got it and didnt read anything like that! But I'm keeping it anyway."
4.0,"It looks just like the picture and anime :) the only down side is the necklace is like a collar material and is too big on my neck. I did end up going a size larger than my normal, I normally do a medium/Large in clothes but did an XL in this and the fit is great!"
4.0,"This is like a Greek sailor's cap, but without the pretension. I didn’t want &#34;scrambled eggs&#34; on the visor or front, and this doesn't have them. The fabric is equally low-key. It's a good black, not just dark gray. I wish it also came in a bright red, or royal blue. (I got this to replace a red knit-fabric cap of similar construction, which I've worn for 25 years ... &#34;worn&#34; now taking on double meaning.)<br /><br />Considering the price, I don't mind that the band around the inside (which holds the rim of the cap up) is made of plastic, not leather. And it turns out that it's only 40% wool (60% polyester), but the fabric looks and feels great. Inside the hat, thin fabric covers that headband, so it's comfortable. Except, in very cold weather, it conducts cold to the forehead, and in warmer weather, the plastic collects sweat, doesn't pass it through. So I've put a bit of knit fabric between the liner and the band, which is solution enough for both issues. (With or without this addition, in my case a Large fits well, and for reference my exact hat size is 7-3/8 Long Oval.) I've seen a few similar caps with leather, some where it's directly against the head (no fabric covering it), but in one case it's a &#34;pressed leather&#34; composite (which in my experience with cheap belts is as durable as cardboard), and another is &#34;split leather,&#34; whatever that is. Ideally (if there are any manufacturers reading), I'd suggest a cloth stiffener, as with a qood quality woven, thick cotton belt. Or perforate the plastic? Or make a &#34;floppy&#34; version. (That is, with no rigid stiffener -- my old hat had none, and was thus even more pocketable in my outerwear.). The band is sewn-in and integral to the cap's constructions, so it can't simply be removed.<br /><br />One other caveat -- on opening the box, I was alarmed to find that the visor curled down severely on one side. To the vendor's credit, they were ready to expedite a replacement (here at Amazon, I can't predict who your vendor might be, so check for yourself), but they first asked me to try curling it back, which they figured should work. They were right. I suppose it could be corrected through a few weeks of fondling, but I chose to speed up the process by clamping the visor around a large dowel for several hours. Although if you happen to get a cap in this shape (from their reviews apparently it's not common), I suggest you check with the vendor first, a couple doses of this clamping did the trick, and the visor has stayed in correct shape ever since. For all I know it would have reverted to normal over time anyway.<br /><br />By the way, the distorted visor made it look as if the visor or even the entire hat was off-center. Not so. Using a tracing, triangle and ruler, I determined that the visor was PERFECTLY shaped and centered on the cap! Once the slouch was fixed, no more optical illusion. (And note that the label is not necessarily meant to be centered -- even in the product photo -- so don't judge by that.)<br /><br />I hope to wear this signature hat for many winters to come. Unless they come out with a red one."
4.0,I wore this blouse on a nighr out with friends and received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"Very nice.. get lots of compliments... Though the three lil' medallions at the bottom were off- center, it is not obvious. It DOES JINGLE quite a bit."
4.0,"A little thin and zipper sticks a little, but it does fit really nice and feels really comfy. For<br />price, I love it."
4.0,"It's pretty, and the fabric is smooth and flowy. However, it was big and baggy on me (I ordered a small). Even for a dress that's supposed to be loose and flowing, it was big. My mom (a size up from me) asked me if I had accidentally ordered her size. I wish I could have kept it, since I liked the pattern and colours, but it just didn't work for my body type (i also might just be unnaturally small: 5'5&#34;, just barely B bra size, 110 lbs)"
4.0,"Wallet is of very good quality, fits all of the essential cards and other assorted personal belongings in a small space within the wallet ,as well as on your person.  Great buy!!!"
4.0,It has pockets! But it also makes your ass look kinda huge. The fabric sticks to your cheeks so if you’re like me and it’s not rumpa smooth skin... you may want spanx before you get into that Benz.
4.0,Okay.  I’ll rank this in different categories.<br /><br />Quality of the costume.  Surprisingly good.  Looks and feels quality.<br /><br />Fit.  Not so good.  Order at least one size bigger than you think you need.  I normally wear an XL OR XXL and thr top is SNUG!<br /><br />If you have too many plates of spaghetti with maple syrup you won’t fit into this one.<br /><br />Get the size right and you’ll be very happy with this.
4.0,Really nice mask simple to operate the lights on it overall nice value for the money
4.0,"A step in the right direction to build awareness of posture habits, albeit not a total solution."
4.0,"This was purchased as a gift for my niece.  It really glows in the dark, and comes on a necklace.  It's a great small gift idea for any little girl who loves fairies!"
4.0,Love<br />Love<br />Love<br />Great quality and fit.  Wish there were more colors to buy!
4.0,"I really love this dress! It's beautiful and flowy! I'm glad I ordered the XXL though. I'm 5'7, 155 pounds, and busty. I love the way it fits! It's the perfect length. But I do have to wear a camisal underneath, or else I would be showing way to much chest area! I got lots of compliments on it!"
4.0,I like the way they look on my wife
4.0,Very nice set of signature cuff links. Worth the money.
4.0,Compact and great for easy storage.  Can pack in a travel bag or purse!
4.0,"Fits a little loose, but since the pants come with a built on belt it really doesn’t matter. The material is great and will be perfect for working in the sun on hot summer days. Very lightweight and breathable."
4.0,This is a killer looking watch but function and manufacturing is definitely what is missing but that is where you get the savings.<br /><br />4 stars goes to overall look and docking it 1 star just do to the fact it is falling apart.
4.0,"It's made of a Jersey material that almost suction cups to your body. Order a half or full size up, i almost died trying to get it off. If you're a tall girl like myself ( 5'10, 150lbs) it comes about where pixie pants would."
4.0,Loved the embroidered part.<br />Very very pretty ❤️
4.0,"Very cute, long and flows"
4.0,"This was a gift and I have never seen it in person (the reason for a 4 grade), but the person who received it said she ""loved it"" and it was very pretty. Looked good from what I saw on Amazon."
4.0,"They work great, but greener than I expected."
4.0,"I ordered XL which is my size, I could even get the dress over my head the sleeves fit bit the rest of the dress couldn’t get below my shoulders.  The dress was pretty and the last be the material."
4.0,The only flaw is the card slots work but tight an havent loosend after the normal break in period but overall a great wallet for the price expect to hold up
4.0,Very cute and the colors are very colorful; almost animated-like. My 11 year old daughter really likes 'em.
4.0,Size is way off. Saving them for next year.
4.0,Too long but good for the price.
4.0,"I got this for a pool party with Christian (conservative) attendees. I needed to be sorta covered, but still be able to enjoy the pool, so I decided to get this white/cherry swimsuit.  Good quality. HEAVY padding on breast area (I cut it out) . Not much support (if you are looking for support, do NOT buy this one - I wore mine with a black bikini top underneath and worked it out. Looks super cute on. Small fits like a medium (of sorts). For reference, I'm 36C, 32 waist, 38 hip and there was some wiggle room. I'd recommend - If you are willing to work with what you get, and what you got."
4.0,It’s a very nice umbrella the color is deep blue so far we are very satisfied with it and would recommend it to my friends 😊
4.0,"For good reason too. He prefers the dishes be hand washed. I prefer to use the dishwasher because I like my dishes clean. He doesn't seem to mind if his handwashed dishes are clean. So, if he uses these gloves, I have a better chance of getting a clean dish."
4.0,I love this dress! Personally it is short so I don't wear it alone but I love to pair it with my leggings. It is a little see through so I make sure to wear a cami underneath. Quality is decent and for the price you really can't beat it. The item also arrived much sooner than expected which was a plus!
4.0,"Very satisfied, very good completion for quantity and cost"
4.0,"This product looks even better in person, and is such a great accessory. Although I must say I would have preferred it to be bigger."
4.0,These necklaces came in a velvety drawstring bag and each one is individually wrapped so they didn't get tangled. The letter is clear and they both look like sturdy necklaces.
4.0,"Very good quality, but one size does not fit all, at least not very comfortably.  I like the product, but wish it came in a larger size.  Too tight around the head, so uncomfortable to wear for long lengths of time."
4.0,This item is really really soft. It 100% relieve feet pain and is comfortable. The stand/ heel doesn't hurt when walking and fit just right.
4.0,Exactly what you think you’re getting.
4.0,"They weren't as deep as I had hoped them to be , but still very nice"
4.0,I like the suit itself but it wasn't for me at all. I usually wear and XL. the suit fit pretty good except for my chest. It did not fit properly at that point and is obviously meant for somebody with a larger chest. Which sucks because I really really like this suit. Other than that it's super cute. Simple. And comfortable.<br /><br />I got in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,Works great and it fits comfortably! Very usable when working out!
4.0,"I ordered this for my son for his birthday and it arrived very quickly but after only one day of wear, the pendent broke off of the chain. I emailed the seller and they sent an entirely new one out immediately but the same thing happened again. Kind of a bummer but at least the service was steller."
4.0,"This was way smaller than it was listed it is a beautiful fabric, it was  lovely and was disappointed I had to send it back."
4.0,I like it and will keep it but it is a bit heavier than expected. I did get a smaller red one that is much lighter (not as &#34;thick&#34; as this one)
4.0,"This wig is pretty, but not as thick as the picture leads the customer to believe. However it is very good for the price and I would recommend it. The curls stay after many brushing sessions and it stands up to washing. Just make sure you part it correctly over your shoulders and down your back or part of the cap inside the wig will show which is a rather obvious tan lacy thing."
4.0,"Runs Small. Does not stretch, quality seems fine print also. I’m an XL I would go one or two sizes up to feel comfortable. This is is definitely tight. Fits like a small large shirt of that makes sense? Will wash before wearing it because it feels stiff."
4.0,"I love this dress I usually wear L or M in dresses but for this one a M would fit perfect , I am 5”1"
4.0,it was too tight
4.0,Fits well and love the material.
4.0,"Un poco juato, pero  me gustaron los colores"
4.0,This fits beautifully. Mine didn't come with the middle chain but I still think it's gorgeous. Everyone in my office loves when I wear this.
4.0,Great product for my biking adventures
4.0,I love it but mine only came with one seed in it
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She and I have been doing the Ren. Faire thing for a few years now, and we thought it would be fun to branch out into something new. We figured we should go for some Steampunk, because why not.<br /><br />My wife already has three corsets, of various colors, so getting her another one was a logical first step in this direction. I liked the look of it, so I bought it. Good choice. It looks amazing on her. The fit is just about perfect, a little on the snug side, but not by much. Complements her body shape perfectly, and makes it darn near impossible for me to keep my hands off of her.<br /><br />The corset actually comes with a little &quot;jacket&quot;, as well. It's more of a shrug, really, but that doesn't quite feel accurate, so I'm going to call it a jacket. It is a separate piece of the costume, and can be added, or not, depending on the look you're going for. The jacket has a choker/collar attached as well, which, along with the strap across the chest, helps give the corset a fun and sexy feel when you're wearing it. There's also a &quot;g-string&quot; included, but my wife is not a huge fan of those, so she didn't try it on.<br /><br />There's also a belt, with an attached pouch, which straps to the waist and chest. That's actually a huge help, because purses aren't exactly in keeping with the aesthetic of the corset, and it's quite a bit more convenient for my wife to carry around her own things, as opposed to me holding all her stuff. It's not super roomy, so don't expect to carry around an iPad or a book. But you can put your cash/credit card and a phone in there, along with some makeup. Alternatively, you could slide your stylishly steampunk accessories (Victorian ray gun, or small dagger, or eyeglasses) and be more authentic. Your call.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars, rather than five, is that putting it on is rather complicated initially. There are a lot of straps, and zippers, and laces, and hooks. And, without a picture in the packaging, it was a little challenging to get it on that first time. After that, my wife found it simpler to do, but that is to be expected. We had to use the product image on Amazon to get it right, so I'm just glad we tried it at home first.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this corset to anyone looking for a quality garment for cosplay. Or, alternatively, you might be looking for something to spice up the bedroom a little, it works for that too. Either way, I imagine you would enjoy it."
4.0,I bought this for our spare vehicle which happens to be a van.  ;)
4.0,Kind of hard to put together but decent quality for price
4.0,It was good size for average face. Comfortable.
4.0,"I was impressed with the quality and delighted to give it as a gift. The chain was shorter than expected, however."
4.0,Not super slouchy like I was hoping for but definitely good warm hats for winter.
4.0,Very cute leg warmers. In the picture they seem to be so long. Perhaps if you are shorter. I am 5'11 so they do not go that high on my legs. They can go a little over the knee but that is stretching them out completely and I prefer to have them a little skrunched up.
4.0,I wish this came with sizes.<br />But I gave it to a friend as a birthday present and it fit her great and she adored it
4.0,I ordered 2 pairs.  Black and gray.  They arrived in separate pkgs.  The gray pair has elastic at the bottom of each leg like the photos.  The black ones don’t. I am keeping them but wish they were the same.
4.0,"These came highly recommended by a family member. I was told to get a half size larger than I normally wear. While these work okay, I probably would have been better off just ordering my normal size. I realize I could have sent them back, but they work fine due to the adjustment strap on the heel. They are fairly comfortable (maybe I just haven't worn them enough) but I find my Keens to work much better!!"
4.0,"Buena calidad, solo fue un poco alto a lo exoectado"
4.0,Like um BUT... the gray leggings are different material than listed. I like the gray ones better. More comfy. The black are a little stiff and tighter.
4.0,"You get more than what you pay for, great sparkle to the piece. I doubt it will last forever, but then, I just wanted to tryout the &#34;rose gold and morganite&#34; trend.  All things considered, this was bigger and more sparkely than I expected.<br /><br />Just keep in mind that you're ordering costume jewelry, not the real thing and you'll be pleased."
4.0,Very dainty. Easily broken
4.0,The product was used as a party favor to female guests celebrating an 80th birthday of a lady born under the pisces sign and was well received.
4.0,"I bought this dress last minute for a Christmas party, I thought it would be green but it end up being more of a dark turquoise color. So was pretty disappointed at first but once I put it on, I felt a little better about the fit. It was the perfect length, a tiny bit loose but definitely think the small would have been too short or too tight so was happy with the medium. It was very thick material also. It came a little wrinkled from being packaged & I tried to iron it but it did not do anything so might have to take it to a dry cleaner. But other than the color being completely wrong, I’m happy with the dress. Very pretty."
4.0,The packaging is bad and product came smooshed. Was gonna return but read another post where they suggested soaking in water for one min and then air drying. I did that and they are now perfect!
4.0,"They look good, were packaged well, delivered on time, but won't fit my Costa Corbina sunglasses."
4.0,"Very cute dress.  I needed something to wear to a wedding that I could breastfeed in and this dress worked for that.  The cut of the neck was off on mine.  Instead of being a typical v-neck, it was more off an off v.  Loved the pockets."
4.0,Love the dress it is little small in bust area
4.0,I love my hair chain!
4.0,This dress looks just like the pic !  length is way too long on me will need to alter it by a few inches for it to look decent .. I’m 5’4 and 120 pounds and got the red in small.. wearable to church birthday parties and many other functions... its a fun dress!!
4.0,"It’s 45% cotton and 55% linen, so false advertising but overall nice, and because cotton is a natural fabric as well I’ll keep them."
4.0,"Nice pin for FSM ministers or enthusiasts. Metal.... Looks like picture. Pin-backs are a rubber material which surprised me, but they hold on to my chef coat through even the most rigorous, athletic shifts."
4.0,The material is pretty nice but its somewhat small. Actually kind of fitted so I won't be able to wear it to the office. But will have to find an alternative use. Beautiful rich color though (I bought the cobalt blue). Excited to wear it soon!
4.0,Shirt is baggy woth plenty of room. For a more fitted look size down.
4.0,"Added a little leather conditioner, which gave the color a little more depth. Probably would have come with age. Nice upgrade for an inexpensive Casio. Includes 4 springbars and a tool."
4.0,The lense fell out even  before I put them on.<br />I returned them and bought a great pair of glasses. 🤓<br />Lucy contacted me and tried to work it out by giving me another set of glasses. Giving them a 4 star for now if they come through with the glasses and the glasses are better than the last ones...<br /> I will give them 5 star.<br />Thanks Lucy
4.0,"It took me a while to figure out how to wear these interesting earrings. Once I did, I like the daintiness of them plus the comfort. They fit my earlobes perfectly. They are sterling silver and made in China."
4.0,"Its well made and stayed together, the only thing is I have small hands so it kept turning."
4.0,"If, like me, you own a baseball glove or leather working gloves, saddle & reins or other leather that needs softening or protecting, this is the correct and right product and this particular product makes it easy to control the application. I would highly recommend this product and this Seller."
4.0,They fit great around the legs and the folding waste was a nice support for after I had my baby. But the length is crazy long and I've always considered myself to have long legs so they would definately trip up a person with normal sized legs. The entire smiley face is crumpled in a puddle at my feet.
4.0,"Si me agradó, regalo de navidad"
4.0,I like that you don't have to wear a bra with this dress and yet it looks nice.
4.0,"Socks are thinner then the pair I got a few years ago, however they are great for out door hikes and prolonged wear. Very comfortable and breathable.<br />Reason for 4/5 I haven’t really had them long enough yet"
4.0,"the size was not correct to the size chart. I ordered a medium and it could not go over my head but I liked it, gave it to my sister."
4.0,Recap on the missing metal ring. It was intentionally left off and improved with canvas loops to hold more hangers more securely. Turns out Amazon had not put the new info up on the product yet.<br />The company's customer service did a great job.
4.0,I read several reviews and debated on sizing. I finally went with a medium. I’m 2 months postpartum so a little soft in the tummy area (typically fit). I’m currently 5’5 and around 138. The skirt fits high (real waist) and is still pretty long which I like because it still covers my shoes a bit. One side is a bit longer than the other (see picture) but not very noticeable.<br />I do have issues with the zipper. It seems to get stuck right at the seam and takes a bit of play before I can get it past that part.<br />Overall I feel it’s a good buy and I recommend!
4.0,lightweight and fits as expected
4.0,"My daughter really like the color and the size is spot on. However, the feel very firm and uncomfortable when walking in them. I think you have to break these in because they are not soft. I would purchase again though"
4.0,Very cute and a quality product for such a low price.
4.0,Love them kind of big
4.0,Straps are a little short and shredding on first wear but other than that it’s ok
4.0,"Good value, great addition for ones wardrobe."
4.0,"Cute, well made but my 4 month old can't wear it because it's a size and a half big! I would still recommend it though because it's well made and cute as a button! Buy a size down."
4.0,"If only it fit!  Dress was pretty but it was too small.  I am normally a 12, 38C and bought the XXL and it was too tight on my arms and bust."
4.0,I got this coat for my 7 year old and he loves it. He really likes that the hood since it surrounds his head comfortably.
4.0,Really cute and simple
4.0,Works well for me to just extend my bras a little due to my band size increasing from working out
4.0,Nice but hearts don’t tend to lay properly.
4.0,I don't like padding but these are very good
4.0,This is impossible to wear off the shoulder. It on the other hand is super cute and comfortable. Make it off the shoulder and Ill give it 5 stars! I cant wait to see if I love the other one I bought as much.<br /><br />Just got my other one and its vibrant and comfortable!!!! I cant wait to wear these.
4.0,"Check the zippers! Forget the hook.<br />Upon arrival, check all the zippers. Several were sewn into the seam and tough to operate.  Move them with care until they are freed up. Should be fine.  I say forget the hook because it is very small and held by a small swatch of fabric.  I wouldn't dare trust the weight of a loaded bag to that thin fabric, stitched into the seam.  Sad - because the hanging feature was what I wanted, as a space saver.<br />Yes the bag is larger than most.I am only using mid-size products like shampoo and lotions. (Not hotel samples). Still, it can fill up fast and get heavy quickly.<br />That being said, this bag is good looking and better than most.  It's a keeper."
4.0,"Both of my boys, 8 and 10, enjoy playing with these.  They are better and more fun than normal poppits.  The shape of this (more 3D) allows them to pop them out by squeezing it too which they enjoy."
4.0,The colors are bright. I have recieved many complaints on this dress. Its comfy and fits well. The material is soft. I would hand wash just to be safe. I dont want it to shrink at all. It is a wrap around dress. I bought the medium I'm 5 3 and 150 lbs my sheet is 34 DD.
4.0,"I'm a plus size and this is a very nice plus size top, looks great!!"
4.0,"Appears to be good quality, but rather large depending on the tie.<br /><br />I usually wear ties that are about 1.5 inches in width.. this exceeds them. But no big deal I guess since the price you pay is super cheap."
4.0,Really soft. Just wish there was a closure at the top. Also if the handles were to lay flat against the sides while carrying on the shoulder. It did have a smell to it when I opened the box but went away quickly.  The color is beautiful.
4.0,Dries quickly.  Cool with good ventilation for hot summer days.
4.0,Adorable design and very comfortable. Order 1-2 sizes up and it’s perfect bra!
4.0,Fits abit small
4.0,I love Mordenmiss. But this dress was just too small. It was one size so i took a chance hoping it would fit like another &#34;one size&#34; dress i got previously from Mordenmiss.
4.0,"I love this suit, with exception to the shorts. The length of shorts is great, but they don't fit snug around my legs and they flip up at the hem. I will only be wearing them in my pool at home, so it's not too big of a deal. The colors are beautiful and I like that the top has underwire."
4.0,Broke fairly quickly (they’re inexpensive) but they’re super cute and look great! Very professional quality and bright colors
4.0,Necklace arrived on time and came with little bag to store if needed. The lettering is very small but overall a cute necklace! Have received many compliments on something so simple.
4.0,Fits my 7 month old. Is a little snug. I definitely don’t see it fitting older kids
4.0,Great for under other tops but too tight material for my comfort to wear alone.
4.0,"Beautiful dress...nice feel...<br />May have to return because it is a exact fit....and I like it a tad looser....I choose a size 8...my usual size...I may return for a size 10....im 5'3"" 135 lb.  37 28 37.<br />I feel like I will have to keep pulling the sleeves down...and a size bigger I think would have a tad bigger sleeve.  This dress is made very well...I love this brand !"
4.0,Very cool and comfy. My feet don't really breath so much and I didn't get to wear them in water but I will. I wore them a lot while on the cruise ship.
4.0,Large but nice
4.0,Arrived in box as pictured in listing.  Nose piece is a very tight fit on real lenses and shouldn’t fall out.  ..didn’t need the temple pieces so I can’t comment on them
4.0,Love these mitts!!
4.0,Always get Isotoner gloves.  Love the way they fit and this color is spectacular!
4.0,A little pricey but sooooo cute!  Summer dresses here we come!
4.0,Very cute. Fits great!
4.0,"Very handy, carry my metro pass for easy access"
4.0,"For the price, it's a very nice pack. The leather is very thin, so it isn't very durable, but it looks great!"
4.0,"Truly disappointing. Children’s sunglasses are sturdier. Unfortunately, cheaply made."
4.0,"Bought this to go over leggings, but the style completely is open to the crotch so no modesty whatsoever.<br />Sad because it was beautiful and the fabric was nice.  But NOT for covering up with leggings!"
4.0,"Looking through them, you can really see discrepancies on LCD screens - my phone turns into a rainbow.  Once I wipe it clean, though, and clean these lenses, it is all very clear.<br />The cables squeeze just enough to keep the glasses in place - very comfortable.  The nose bridge is a little narrow, but, I have a broad nose, so, that might just be me!"
4.0,is as advertized
4.0,"Elegant box with a glass lid. I would give it 5 stars if the pillows were actual pillows. They are kind of hard sided forms, but they do hold their shape."
4.0,"Will last forever!  Sturdy, but a bit stiff.  Hoping as I wear it will relax!"
4.0,"Love them! Haven't worn a bra since. I work a fairly physical job (lots of walking, bending, reaching, and lifting) and everything stays in place. My biggest complaint is washing them. Due to sweating, I wash them after one wear and I'm always having to fish the padding out of the washer to put back into the sports bra. So laundry takes twice as long now. And I hate hand washing the padding. But they wash well, never dried."
4.0,"I am 190lbs and 5'3"". I bought an extra large . I had a hard time getting it on but it's not uncomfortable. It rolls down in the back for me but I think if it was a little longer it might not. Doesnt go all the way to my bra. I havent wore it around just yet, so I'll update later and let you know how it does working in it. I was worried i would be constantly pulling it up from rolling down but the front doesnt roll down at least not yet anyways<br /><br />Update:<br />It sure makes you sweat while working with it on. It started hurting in the creases of my legs at the end of the night. I couldn't wait to take it off. But I guess that's what you get when you want to look slimmer in the belly lol"
4.0,"The watch looks very nice, I would have liked the face to be bigger because that's what's in right now, big face watches.  But over the band and watch look good and appear to be of good quality.  I have received several compliments on the watch.  Glad I made the purchase."
4.0,I recieved this watch and was immediately impressed it looks great in person.  When ordering cheaper watches alot of the time the are very light weight and feel cheap.  This watch was not one of those.  It has a very solid and well built feel to it.  It is very easy to set the time which you do need to expect to do when putting it on after sitting.  The automatic winder works great and is a great feature.  The only reason for a 4 star review is the band is a little stiff.  It is almost like it needs to get broken in. But for the most great watch!  Feels great and looks amazing.
4.0,I love these! The color and fabric quality was great! Didn’t fade after washing or shrink any. My only problem is the top is a little more cropped than I expected but the shorts are big enough to make up for it! I got a medium and I’m like 5’3 and weigh 120 and they’re loose enough but not baggy!
4.0,"The push up part is not really true, the material is kinda bulky and it shows badly at the gym, but for lounging around home this is amazing, the support is great (even though I have small boobs,AA Cup)"
4.0,The posts were silver but the mini hoops were not. I don't mind since they're properly gold tone coated and the quality is quite good. Beautiful shine and real looking to the point of fooling the eye up close. Wouldn't know the earrings are fake until inspecting them. I'm impressed.
4.0,"Great quality product, I wouldn’t trust it to be fully submerged in water, but very water “resistant”. No problem with touch screen connectivity or thumb print ID for the normal people with iPhones."
4.0,"It's definitely cute, I still get compliments on it when I wear it (I bought it like 7 years ago). But it definitely is cheap metal, but it has lasted all these years."
4.0,Funny gag gift
4.0,It’s a bit big for my wrist but it’s comfy and Stylish.
4.0,Very cute hat was a little small on me :)
4.0,"Good sports bras. But never order small, go medium even if you are size32B."
4.0,I like this bag but sometimes the strapped got tangled up. In the end it god really dirty I had to throw it away.
4.0,"When exercising, the proper clothing can make a difference. I tend to just grab whatever shorts I can find and I begin my routine, but I am aware that there are better options and that was enough to convince me to get the Gafeng Mens Running 2 in 1 Shorts.<br /><br />Thin and loose- fitting, these shorts are designed for freedom of movement. They are much more comfortable to wear than regular shorts and they are useful for those who run, jog, do yoga, or for most any other type of workout. The material is slick and it helps repel moisture. It feels smooth and cool against the skin, which is what you want/need when you exercise.<br /><br />With fitting, the shorts I got are on the looser side. The drawstring holds them in place well enough, but looking at the sizing chart, my waist size is in- between a medium and large. I recommend getting them a little looser because tightness is less comfortable, but it’s a matter of personal preference. Oh, and the phone pocket is a nice addition. Even when I take a long walk/jog or hike, I need to have my phone handy and these shorts provide a convenient place for the electronics.<br /><br />These shorts come in a few different colors. I got black, which I prefer because it matches with most anything. Not that I am trying to make a fashion statement with my exercising shorts, but you know what I mean. Neutral is best when you exercise. I try to avoid dark colored shirts because they get too hot in the summer, and I live where it is summer most of the year. But with shorts, dark is okay.<br /><br />Proper clothing can make a make a major difference when you exercise. These Gafeng shorts are made for those who run or do other forms of exercise and they definitely help make working out more comfortable."
4.0,Thicker than anticipated
4.0,"it's good material, but it is kind of big, not sure if my face is small but the neck area bunches up and the eye patch covers a lot of area. It still works but it is bigger than it looks."
4.0,"The mask gets top marks for cool looks, but the functionality is not all there.<br />My mask did not come with a nose clip, so if you are wearing glasses like me, it means there is a lot of fog; be prepared to bump into anything and everything because you cannot see..."
4.0,It arrived on the day it said it would. It was really well packaged and it looks like great quality. It is for a friend's birthday so I have not handled it myself but the look of it is perfect!
4.0,Girlfriend loves it and it seems to be well made. They sent the wrong tabby color but it's not an issue. Close enough lol!
4.0,"14 karat gold filled is kind of misleading, they looked as if they are more of a light brass than 14 karat Gold."
4.0,"It’s not overbearing, but still eye catching….I really like it."
4.0,"It's too big for me.<br />The lugs hang over my arm, I have a 7.25"" wrist<br />It is very beautiful though."
4.0,Cute swimsuit. It covered the mommy stretch marks on my belly but left the back side cheeky and sexy. I like how adjustable it is cause of all the ties.
4.0,"This is a great belt and the sliding buckle is outstanding.  My only complaint is that it's a bit wider and heavier than I had hoped.  I prefer narrower belts, but for other people I am sure it is fine.  Regardless, it is definitely a very good belt"
4.0,"Good product, unfortunately it does not survive long through airports as it got confiscated by TSA after about 10 trips. Other than that, it was a quality product."
4.0,"Really love this shirt,  wished it was a little longer, order a size up."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:306605665968c9f746f70f09798078aa]] I like it the material is real good not thin at all but still breathable. However the skirt is very long so when you pull the strings it’s a lot of string left over same with the top the strings are very long so it’s many way to tie it around your body. The skirt is a lil tight around the waist if you have thicker thighs tho so I wouldn’t suggest going a size down unless you have a small waist. I’m 5’1 & 153 pounds. Also the is a lil brighter then the pic but still a burgundy shade.
4.0,They are huge on your face. So if you have a small face I wouldn't recommend. But I like them. They look good on me. Not cheaply made either. Thick plastic.
4.0,"I love this dress, it fits absolutely perfectly! One thing I don't like is that the sleeves are only one layer of material, and I think it would be better if they had a bit more to give a bit more fluff. As it is, it's basically a sleeveless dress with some extra lace or whatever attached. Otherwise, it's an amazing dress!!"
4.0,"These are really pretty and very close to the ones in the movie.  The only thing I had to do was sand down one of the areas that hook behind the ear as it was very sharp.  These are NOT gold, or gold plated, but are super easy to wear and are different than other ear cuffs.  They are pretty light as well and comfortable. The seller is honest and prompt with shipping."
4.0,"Very comfortable.  Length was just a little long for me, but not so long as it was sloppy - made it more comfortable. My height is 5'5&quot;, 126 lb and ordered a medium. Fabric was nice - not too thin. Was hoping they would be available in a dark navy."
4.0,"Very flowy and doesn't cling. I'm used to always pulling on suits because I'm self conscious, but felt comfortable in this top."
4.0,"I have an average size head and find these a bit snug. For a 30 min workout it’s ok, but I wouldn’t wear longer for fear of getting a headache. The seam runs horizontally and is smooth so it totally a non issue. They are very absorbent and seem to wash well. And the color selection entertains me!"
4.0,"Love the colors! The shorts are a little shorter than I like, since I'm 6'2, but overall good fit."
4.0,So far it has been a good fit. It is long which is what my daughter needs to have under certain shirts for school. I have not dried it as I read other reviews that the lace can get messed up if you dry it.
4.0,"I ordered a medium. I'm 5'1.5 I felt the dress was a bit long but being so tall I experience this more often then not. Landed above my knees. I'm a 36 c chest and I felt this was a little larger on top then it should have been. Flattering to my stomach. At least I thought so. Overall, I liked the dress I might buy other colors."
4.0,These are cute and just as advertised. Definitely seem to be real sterling silver.
4.0,"Nice purse, but re-read the reviews and realized l never received a shoulder strap or the small purse with my order."
4.0,"Very cute, beautiful, but way too big for a charm bracelet. Would be great for zipper pull though"
4.0,We’re half-way through the season with these boots and they still look like new! They’re cute and warm too! They could be more flexible for my 2-year-old but she still likes them.
4.0,Just what I was looking for as teacher appreciation gifts for my sons teachers (there were eleven lol). The school has done a Harry Potter themed well and these worked. I did notice that the socks were not in individual squares so as teachers choose flaps to open the socks could move around randomly as we carried from class to class.
4.0,"I liked the jacket , but the LX was to small !😂😂"
4.0,"The shirt was fine, the problem is the size.  In a number of reviews I saw where the size runs large so I ordered a size smaller than normal...didn't work out.  The sizes run true to form, order what your normally wear."
4.0,Pretty large!
4.0,"I just received my package, it is Christmas present for my daughter, I know she will love it!"
4.0,"Light, thin, inexpensive, reliable. What else is there to say? If you need a good beater watch you don't mind destroying, this is it. It even has nerd appeal."
4.0,I bought this for my son and he loves the jacket.The only thing I don’t like is it’s really thin.
4.0,I am in search of similar pre-tied for an underscarf - large with longer tails and nonslip cotton.  This was close but not quite.
4.0,Really cute but runs a bit large and isn't quite as fitted as I expected. But otherwise it's awesome!
4.0,A little thin but cute and worth the price.
4.0,"Super Cute-I typically wear a size 4 and ordered a medium and its snug but very flattering, good thickness to material not see thru looks just like the picture, this is very cute office dress"
4.0,"These are nice if you are getting a few items, but too small for regular grocery shopping"
4.0,I loveeeee it! My friend have the brown and the blue
4.0,Great affordable set of tie bars if you are looking for variety. The 2 gold tie bars are slightly gold tinted- they don't look as gold as they do in the stock photo. They are all great designs though and work great.
4.0,"they worked well for a loud concert we took our son to, I was able to wear them as well because you can adjust them"
4.0,Ordered small- fits perfect.  I am 5’5 123lbs small frame.  Sleeves perfect length- come right to end of my wrist.  Does have a chemical smell- will be washing and hoping it doesn’t shrink.  Only Other issue is the buttons are noisy.  Yes noisy.  They clack around and are loose.  Very strange.  Just appears they are cheaply made and that’s how they are.  Overall fit of jacket is true to size and for the price it’s great.  Button issue may be more annoying though.
4.0,Puffy sleeves
4.0,It appears to look like a metal accessory. The heart is a light weight metal and very durable. It is a gold plated hard plastic which should not tarnish if you wear perfumes around the neck. A definite eye catching piece of jewelry.
4.0,I am going to send it back. It was a little small. I am skeptical about ordering a smaller size. I am afraid it might be too small. The hole in the back was a little to large for my style and comfort.
4.0,"Didn’t fit like I expected but it has great material, order a size up"
4.0,The dress is very cute. The color and length are perfect. I ended up returning the dress only because I felt like the skirt part was a little too fluffy for my taste.
4.0,"The strap finally broke, also the zipper head broke. The wallet is very nice holds a small phone credit cards and some other small items. Very easy to carry<br />I will buy again"
4.0,"This a cute bag, but a little flimsy. However, my niece loves it and uses it in qny occasions. She said the color is cool and the strap's length is just perfect for her height. No need to adjust. What a girly stuff!"
4.0,This is golden *Blessed
4.0,My wife says it's just okay nothing great
4.0,"I ordered a large so it would be loose, but it fits more like a small medium. I love the print though...just order a size up."
4.0,"had to adjust the clips so it would fit, if it weren't possible to adjust the hat would have been too small."
4.0,Ugh the shoulder straps constantly get twisted or one or the other will fall down I have had to add a small cross piece of denim to make sure they stay put otherwise it's a good little jumper
4.0,They function as described and are made of durable material.
4.0,My daughter and her cheerleading friends loved wearing them at competitions
4.0,"My daughter loves her new bunny shoes.  I just want to note that they are not really pink, more of a peach color.  Still great shoes, none the less.  I would definitely purchase them again."
4.0,This is a very cool piece of jewelry. I do wish the center chains were a little wider because it doesn't hang on me the way it does in the picture. That may not be the manufacturer's fault; women with a larger chest than the model may all be in the same boat.
4.0,She loves them ! Soft too
4.0,"Very comfortable, perfect for lounging during winter."
4.0,"I can't stress how SOFT this material is. This is perfect for laying around at home and going out, however, this is NOT workout proof.<br /><br />After a workout, it traps in all the sweat and makes you feel disgusting when taking it off. So I strictly use these at home for comfort or pajamas. They are squat proof to a degree, but if you look you can totally see the seems and color of your panties"
4.0,Not so good quality but item is ok. My daughter liked it.
4.0,"Pretty, but the trim is not bright red as pictured.  It's burgundy/wine colored."
4.0,"This is a very nice style and I have about 8 of these in different colors. It is a bit tight in the back, but otherwise, I really like the style."
4.0,Very comfy.  A little loose at the top.
4.0,"Got two pair for my g/f.  MAKE SURE U BUY AT LEAST TWO PAIR!  The reason is that these hose are more durable than the average stockings, but they are alien enough that the first pair will PROBABLY get a tear because of the handling, ""learning curve!""  That being said, rips, tears and holes actually DO NOT RUN as advertised!  Lastly, in order for these to fit as many sizes as possible, there is ALOT of fabric in these hose.  That is why I suggest that these are perfect for tall and plus size gals.  Size 0-6 may want to pass on these!  ;-)"
4.0,like the style. It's a little small for a size 8 but i'm keeping them.
4.0,Great quality just too small
4.0,"The sweater was much thicker and bulkier than I expected.  It’s comfortable and on the softer side.<br /><br />For me, it seemed to run bigger, as it’s supposed to be on the loose casual side.  I’m 5’2 145 and I ordered a Medium.<br /><br />The arm length was a little to long.  I pushed it up and it felt clownish, so I ended up rolling the sleeves.<br /><br />I got the red color and the tan section hit right at my mid section (I didn’t think of it accentuating the tummy area when ordering).<br /><br />Overall, perfect for colder months.  I could see myself lounging around with a nice hot chocolate with this."
4.0,"They are sort of wide, for a more narrow face. Nose pieces take a bit to get adjusted comfortably. All in all, they seem pretty well made. The calm tint on the lense is most desirable. They are more feminine in style, and look great on my wife. Worth the cost of purchase, and arrived on time."
4.0,It's really thin and packable so it's great for traveling. But I think it's usable only on light rain. Very cute style I love it.
4.0,it's nice and cute but the leaves fall out after a while.
4.0,"Super cute! It is however darker than expected. Idk if I was sent the wrong color but it is darker than it is in the picture. The fabric is super soft and it is comfy and easy to wear. I usually wear a 9 and I got a size large and it's a little roomy. However it does ride up as you walk, so all my girls with a small waist and big backside be aware of this. I got a lot of compliments on it and I would recommend, just be aware of the color and it riding up."
4.0,"The headphones work but are not adjustable in the hat. So I can only listen to one at a time. Also they don’t come out to wash the hat. So when it gets gross you just have to replace it. Good for price I guess, sound quality is not as great as I hoped. I would recommend this for a middle schooler that would probably just lose it anyways."
4.0,"So far so good. It is a little thin, but very comfortable. It does have that distressed look that I was hoping for. I have only had it for a few weeks so time will tell on how well it holds up."
4.0,It was what I hoped it would be
4.0,Small and tight. Still dope.
4.0,"I am 5ft 100lbs, I ordered the smallest size due to other reviews, I should have ordered a medium, like in all the other patty tops I have ordered these are extremely snug! If you are close to my weight I don't recommend the smallest, unless you like when everyone can see every detail of your bod in color lol. Other than this, the fabric kind of itches even though it is soft, and the specific shape they have made this top to be makes it ride up my belly which i find super unattractive. Despite all this negativity, this is my go to long sleeve, it is cute and flattering to my figure, if I had purchased a medium this top would probably be perfect."
4.0,Convenient but not that warm
4.0,I ordered the 4-5.  Looks more like an 8.  Besides that they looked nice. We returned them without trying them on.
4.0,Girlfriend liked it and wears it often. I thought the stones would be bigger due to the picture
4.0,These are actually pretty nice and it is at a good price
4.0,"Outfit fits very nice excépt I am 5’4 and it was a little too long for me so I did a little hemming on the bottom. It accentuated my curvy body, it wasn’t comfortable and made a cute clubbinn outfit while on vacation"
4.0,Very cute! Definitely a little too big and it does stretch out as you wear it so u recommend a size down. Mines too large and I just tie the back with a tie until I can shrink it haha. Definitely recommend. I have like b-c cups and there’s extra room but I’m not worried about flashing anyone.
4.0,"This eye mask uses adjustable Velcro straps, is very light, and has molded eye cups that don't press against the eyes. Only negative for me is that the nose area does not seal out the light for me. So, I'm still looking for a mask that does it all. This one is very close. A moldable material around the nose area is really needed to close out this residual issue for me."
4.0,"Very pretty, except I don't like the clip, I think its going to break."
4.0,I love this dress  But I have to adjust the top a little big but a great dress
4.0,well made but small. Good for casual use of for use by young girls. They actually looks better in real.  Good price & prompt shipping.
4.0,It looks sooo cute on! I bought his for my cruise and liked it so much that I left this one on for the whole trip :) because it is a cheapish metal it does wear out and look sort of dull fairly quickly. I would definitely buy another one!
4.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and this comes almost to my knees. I would once have worn it as a dress. As a modest tunic it's awesome. Deduction of one star because it's really wrinkly fabric, don't pack it for a trip unless you want to re-wash or iron."
4.0,Boots are great in the snow but you must size up 2 to 3 sizes otherwise they are very difficult to get on.
4.0,"Review for: Magitaco 3 PCS Stainless Steel Love Bracelet Bangle for Women Mix Color Open Clasp with Cubic Zirconia Stones Bracelet<br /><br />These bracelets are shiny and pretty. They are solid bracelets that have a hidden hinge and latch. They are only costume jewelry but the price also reflects that. Most important, check the dimensions because these bracelets are quite small, under 7 inches. The dimensions are clearly listed on the product page.<br /><br />My bracelets arrived in a small velvety bag with each bracelet in a separate plastic bag."
4.0,"As a bonafide bunny lover, I was excited when I was searching for bunny themed socks to wear to work (I work in the Veterinary field), and came across these. It's a workweek worth of socks! They have a very cute and funky print that is eye catching, but not tacky. There are some downsides, however: They are made small, and when I'm wearing them, they are stretched out and distorted. There's also bunches of loose strings inside the sock that snag my toes every time I put them on. Otherwise, I like this product, and would recommend them to fellow bunny lovin' friends that have smaller feet and legs."
4.0,It is a little bigger than expected. Cute dress though.
4.0,"Quality decent, hips large"
4.0,"A little smaller than I thought, but I still love it! Color is a perfect mahogany brown/red. I’m still getting used to the small/tight pockets, but over all, it’s a win!"
4.0,We ordered these for kids and they were a bit too big.
4.0,Perfect clutch/cross body bag for a night out. It goes with everything.
4.0,Excellent fitting for those that have trouble finding the right leggings for your child.
4.0,"Less full than expected but flowers are as pictured and fits well (26&#34;waist, normally size 2)."
4.0,"I have been shopping for a tea party dress, finally!  I got one that fits well.<br />I am size 12, but I ordered XL...it gives more space in my chest area.<br />Lovely dress! can't wait to  wear it for my daughter's bridal shower party.<br />Thank you......."
4.0,"Pretty flimsy metal, but cute ring."
4.0,"5'2&#34; 130 lbs 34B ordered small. Fits well, just as pictured. Could live without the tie straps, takes away from the sexyness. Other than that, love the high cut side, low cut front. Material is good, this is a quality dress for the price."
4.0,"Maybe not the last watch band you will ever buy, but for $12.00 it is a great deal. Band can be adjusted down to around 6&#34; wrists by removing links that are held by pins. Clasp is easy to open but locks securely. End piece is stamped metal of strong design. Does not come with spring pins. 2.5mm spring pins will not fit."
4.0,"It ran smaller than expected, but it is a pretty shirt."
4.0,"If you are looking for a way to protect your Madza's keyfob from drops and scrapes, this cover does the trick! The silicone is nice to hold in your hand and feels easy to grip, not slippery. It has already protected my fob from a few drops at waist height. I have been using this for a week now at the time of this review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Easy to put on<br />-Comfortable and easy to grip<br />-Fits perfectly for Mazda3 2014 fob<br />-Colors match my i Grand Touring<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Attracts lint/dust very easily<br />-No cutout for &#34;PANIC!&#34; button; I've accidentally set it off as the sleeve is the normal thickness on top of the panic button.<br /><br />The cons are pretty easy to ignore, and I am glad I purchased one. In comparison to other keyfob covers I've seen, this one is built just as good as any other."
4.0,"Got these as favors/useful items for my son's birthday party where the kids made their own pizzas. These aren't heavy duty by any means, but they were perfect for that.  Aprons should hold up for several uses after that.  Hats are flimsier but still fine."
4.0,"many compliments, great price for a fad item, giving 4 starts because the ones with the jewelry  (triangle and yin/yang) are very cheap looking, I just removed them and used the choker."
4.0,This lightweight sandal is perfect for the summer. They definitely needs to be broken in before wearing them for an extended period of time. After they are broken in they are incredibly comfortable.
4.0,"Wife loved the anklet, but it arrived broken.  Sent it back with no issues.  Have not purchased a replacement as of yet."
4.0,This weather is certainly a good value. It fits as expected. The only issue with I have is that it seems to get snags easily.
4.0,COMFORTABLE AND FIT MY BABY'S HAM SHAPED FEET...LOL...NICELY!!! HE HAD NO COMPLAINTS!!!!
4.0,"Nice and thick, but not to thick to fit in running shoes."
4.0,It's pretty but looks like what I paid for ....not expensive.  Cute.
4.0,These are very cute for the cost and decent quality. Just wish they were more gold. They come off a bit more rosey
4.0,I bought this for my daughter for X-mas. Hope she likes it
4.0,This is a tee shirt like material..and thin like one. It is very nice but was expecting more thickness but it looks great with a shirt under it. Nice subdued color!
4.0,enjoy wearing  good feel
4.0,"Nice drape to the fabric & cut. Like the pockets. Waist a little undefined, & moves about. Still I like it."
4.0,"Attractive purse, but too small to use as an everyday bag. Probably use it for evening."
4.0,"Good value, soft and fit as promised"
4.0,"Pros: The texture of band is great. Fits well into watch slots. Nice color.<br />Cons: Length of band is short. Even with both sides expanded to the fullest, tight on/off. I have average size hands."
4.0,"The design on this is beautiful; however, the top is not very long (I am 5'3&#34; and the XL top does not cover my butt). Additionally, its measurement by the hip area is smaller than stated. Overall, it is a very lovely top, but I would recommend ordering a size up if you are full figured."
4.0,"This is a cute, flattering dress. It fits pretty well and is easy to move around in. It looks a bit dressier than I expected and is two layers, but I love the sleeve length and knee length. I’m 5’9 and ordered a small so I love that it was long enough for me."
4.0,"material and costume is great! however it is extremely big! needed to be at minimum 5'10"" for proper fit"
4.0,I ordered this in xl. The stomach fits however this is made for flat chested people. I am rather disappointed because I am really trying to lose some weight. The material is very nice and it seems to be durable. The company did help me out and were very nice. Just make sure if you are above B or C cup to ask them if it will fit you.
4.0,Was much much smaller than I thought.. Item on ad pic should have a reference next to it
4.0,Ordered a total of 5 and 1 of the 5 came defective and doesn’t light up. The ones that work are great.<br /><br />Reordered the one that came defective and the 2nd one didn’t work either
4.0,Just started taking flamenco lessons. This skirt fits my needs and my budget.
4.0,Good quality but runs really big. I bought the xs (I’m 5” 7’ and 115lbs) but it still did the job!
4.0,Its nice just didn't fit
4.0,Fits as it should very soft. Love it!
4.0,"I ordered the pink skirt in S and M, to make sure I get the one that fits the best. The M skirt was quite good but a little too big around my waist so I returned it. The small one wasn't the same color as the medium skirt. It was more a peach pink color. I also really liked it so I kept that one."
4.0,"This dress turned out to be way too big for me, so I returned it for a refund with no problem. The length was much longer than the one shown in the pictures. I wanted to like it so bad,  but it just wasn't a good fit for me. The fabric was a little bit heavy, which would be perfect for fall or winter wear. I think curvier girls over 5'5"" would be able to rock this dress."
4.0,"The material is great, I ordered a Large but I should have gotten the Medium for tighter fit. But overall its a great outfit can be dressed up or down."
4.0,"It's a super cute, quality swimsuit. Note: runs long on the torso and so the neck line hangs too low. We will need to shorten the shoulder straps for it to fit correctly"
4.0,"I received this bracelet about a week ago. I love the way it looks. The only thing I don't like is that it loosens up and the beads slide on the bracelet, so I find I have to readjust it often."
4.0,Came to me broken into two pieces. I was so  disappointed.
4.0,Love the look and feel of the bag. The strap is nice and long. The only thing is that 2 of the zippers for the pockets are non working. They were out into the bag and then zipper starts in the middle and the zipper is closed.
4.0,Runs small. I would size up.
4.0,Nice bra and very flattering but the comfort level is not the best.
4.0,Nice and cute ring I like it
4.0,"The gloves fit well, and I use them for taking my dog for a walk in the winter and sometimes driving my car"
4.0,"These boots are adorable. I did not notice that there was an odor like other reviews stated. I am a spot on size 6 and if I truly wanted to wear these as warm boots, I’d go up 1/2 size to accommodate a heavier sock."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:7371c1ab76d0957969dd2bbed19d5c20]] I decided to get these umbrellas because I have always wanted to get a clear on. These look really nice and have a couple great features. First off, the size of them is really nice and edges hang down so that there is a higher chance of you not getting wet. Also, they all come with a latch that you push on to open the umbrella making it a little faster to access. Lastly, since the material is plastic it makes it easier to shake off the water when you are done using it. I would say about 90% of the water slides right off if you give it a few good shakes do you don’t have to worry about your car or home getting wet from it. The only downfall with these is the sturdiness. It does not fell like they can withhold a rainstorm with high winds. The material is thin plastic and feels a little flimsy. Other than that, these are perfect for normal and calm rainfalls!"
4.0,"Very comfortable, sleeves and body were a bit longer than I expected but I was pleased overall with the shirt"
4.0,"So as far as functionality goes, I think these are pretty awesome. I got them because if I'm too rough on my legs (i.e. Squats, deadlifts, running for a while etc.) my knees will start to swell. I've only worn them a few times and so far my legs feel great after a workout.<br /><br />The one downside to them is that after trying them on a second time (I didn't even work out in them or anything at that point) I noticed several small holes or tears along the seams. It doesn't seem to affect how they work but I did expect them to stay in better shape than that. Especially when I hadn't even been able to put them into action yet."
4.0,Cheap and the screws get loose overtime and the things bend if treated rough. I still like them tho. Id rather buy a bunch of these then 1 nice pair because they would outlast and be more bang for your buck in the long run. Plus you get fresh ones every so often.
4.0,"Super cute dress but way to big for me. I ordered a medium because that’s what I get in department stores but it was way too loose, especially in the waist area. I’m 5’5” 140lbs and 8 months pregnant. I returned it and got a small!"
4.0,I like the suit. Only thing is too big
4.0,"Clear bags are required for my job. This bag is no frills - no pockets, no shoulder strap, no double zipper - but it's spacious enough for all my stuff. If you need something basic, aren't hard pressed for time (delivery took 6 days) and are trying to find your least expensive option, this is it."
4.0,"The material is really good. Not cheap at all, the only down fall is does not grasp good too your neck. Other stoles have a cut out portion to your neck. Probably a little too thick, and needs adjustment around the neck area. You need to fold it so it doesn’t stand out more than your other stoles."
4.0,The shirt is very nice but I think the size is smaller then it should be for a 2x.
4.0,Super comfy and cute! I already washed it many times and still looks like new. I’ll get another one in a different color.
4.0,"fits well , not extremely breathable but works great."
4.0,"Wow...have been wanting to try compression socks out for a while.  These are working nicely.  They are snug as they should be, but , I do have wide size calfs.  That being said, to get a good fit on calf, the foot section is a little on the large size, a tad bit long.  I also do have that snug band around the top of my leg that has the indentation.  That would be the only take away for me with these socks.  I fully intend to order more!!!!!"
4.0,These earrings are so nice.  I like the smaller ones for every day wear.  The larger ones would be nice for going out.
4.0,"I owned a pair of Phoenix Short Lace boots three years ago and loved them so much I bought another pair. The newer pair doesn't have a side zip which I miss since I now have to lace them each time. I've had numerous compliments on them - the style, texture, and neutral quarry color that goes with almost everything. Thanks, Sorel for your consistent quality."
4.0,I bought this product and I had a hard time deciding on what size to purchase. I purchased a size too big but they will work for me. I just have to hope that I never truly fill them out :)
4.0,Love the color and it's exactly the way it looks on picture. ..
4.0,Boot was a little narrow. Could have went up 1/2 size. But overall I love the style.
4.0,I ordered a size up and it fit.
4.0,"This fit a bit smaller than my son preferred.  He likes hats to be a bit looser.  This fit more like a beanie style hat.  Well made, the color is as shown so still a good quality hat."
4.0,GREAT GLOVES
4.0,"Beautiful steampunk piece, perfect for any wardrobe. Company that sells them great to work with! This beautiful cream colored 3d rose on a brass setting pendant with brass chain is just perfect to accentuate any outfit in your closet!"
4.0,"I love the size. I have to put them through the wash with softener to get them comfortable on my head. Thereafter, they quite lovely. I just hope that the print will not peel off eventually or maybe they would end up having a shabby chic look. For now I’m loving them."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, fit perfect and delivered as promised. Thank you. I will buy again."
4.0,"Nothing wrong with the top, good quality, very soft fabric. Just a little shorter than I was hoping."
4.0,Exactly as shown in pic. The color is bright. The material is kinda like chiffon but they are no spilts at the sides. Tru to size. I ordered xl to be on the safe side and its a tad roomy but fine none the less. Had a slight smell when it came.
4.0,Nice but they are smaller than I thought.
4.0,Fits good but run short in legs taller people fits like capris
4.0,Nice Apron Fits Well....I Bought It For Somebody For Father's Day....They Love It....
4.0,These slippers are somewhat tight around the instep. Otherwise beautiful and comfortable.
4.0,Material is not so good
4.0,"It is nice and shiny when it is new.  The links are well polished and comforatble.  It will hold a large, heavy medallion without fear of breaking, which is the purpose for which it was purchased."
4.0,These are cute and seem to be well made however note they are smaller than the size of a dime. They would be more suitable for a preteen
4.0,These are nice little socks so I will give them four stars.  The picture shown with the product is obviously not accurate.  I'm a size 8 and they barely come over the ball of my foot.
4.0,The sleeves and fit in itself is on the smaller size... but a super comfortable adorable shirt... also they sent me the wrong strip colors... but the one I got was still cute so I kept it
4.0,They are really cute but they also are a bit cheap and easily bend.  They also don't sit quite right so fall down a lot.
4.0,"These watches are more or less the ubiquitous cheap digital watch. It's built about as well as one can expect given the price point, though I'd note in different countries the same watch is available far cheaper. A anecdote of it's cultural relevance, at one point this watch was listed as a point of suspicion for individuals detained during the war in Afghanistan. A detained individual was asked about it and replied that if that point had merit an awful lot of US soldiers would be detained as well."
4.0,This fits great under my helmet and is very warm.  Washes nicely.  hasn't stretched out yet!
4.0,It’s really cute. A bit small in size. Thin material. Not sweater like material.
4.0,He was not happen with the silky feeling/rayon on the outside.  He wished is was more cotton or soft.
4.0,My Grandma loved it
4.0,Wish it had the chain on back to hold tie to shirt but was nice the way it was.
4.0,"The bag is very cute, but there isn't much space for how large the bag is. Because the bag is stiff it doesn't allow for large wallets within the bag and stuff in the pockets.<br />Very cute though!"
4.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; and 142 lbs. I'm normally a medium but read the reviews and took the suggestion to size up. DO NOT listen to people saying these shirts run small. They absolutely do not, those people clearly are in denial about their size and wasted my time since I had to return them for the correct size.<br />Otherwise, they are very soft and show off my shoulders and sides well. Great product. Just make sure to order your normal size."
4.0,"5'4&#34; 140lbs and ordered an XL, which was the perfect size for me. The quality is not fantastic but I still really liked it and it looked adorable!"
4.0,"I love Ultra shoes. These fit great, but the reflection is a bit trippy, in certain lighting conditions"
4.0,Good hat. Looks good and feels good. Just wish it would have been shipped with something filling the hat instead of being squished into a small package leaving semi-permanent creases on the crest. A month of solid wearing they are still there. Otherwise 5 stars.
4.0,The band is nice and easy but the quality is not as I expected.
4.0,The shirt is NOT a dress. It was very short. I wore it with jeggings and it worked well though. The hat was pretty big on me but the glove fit fine. The shirt made me very sweaty because I danced a lot in it. I was relieved that there were no slits in the shirt because the previous one I returned with the slits showed a lot of skin!
4.0,"I used it for Halloween, I think right under the chest piece it could be a little smaller but for a 30 something dollar dress it is awesome!"
4.0,Wearing two of these every day now! I love how flexible it is I can still do anything and don't even feel like I'm wearing a ring!
4.0,"These are durable and well made. The only ding is that there is a thin elastic band at the waist, instead of a thick and stretchy waist/tummy area. Therefore it looks pretty obvious if you're a little soft around the middle, and it can be uncomfortable."
4.0,I love this ring. It is beautiful and elegant. I always got compliments on it! The one thing i didnt like is that the 3 pieces arent stuck together so they move around.
4.0,HAVE NOT USED IT YET BUT EXPECT IT TO BE GREAT
4.0,always order these pants and the price is good with amazon
4.0,Love that I do not need to remove my gloves to use my smart phone.
4.0,It was a Father’s Day gift
4.0,Color was unique.  Sleeve length a bit short.
4.0,Super cute! The sweater is super soft and high quality! The hood looks a bit odd maybe the way it's sewed but everything else is awesome! I recommend not machine washing it as the fur will get matted after a couple washes
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. The only reason I’m sending it back is that it fits me way to big. If you plan to buy this dress, please downsize."
4.0,The material is strange. Like I would have sweat marks if I sweat just a tiny bit. But the shape of the dress is super flattering. I’m 5’5 and 230 and I got a 1x
4.0,"This is a very nice quality hoodie! I bought a XXL for my large and tall boyfriend (6’4”and 300 lb) who loves Tapatio. The sweatshirt seemed to fit more like an XL or even an L. The sweatshirt was obviously too small on him but when I asked the seller if I could return it to them, they insisted that I just keep it and gave me a refund. Very nice seller!!!"
4.0,This is a beautiful ring. It arrived on time and soon as i saw it I knew i had a good deal. No regrets here.
4.0,"Great small wallet.. need more pockets tho, and heavier magnet for holding money.. but I use it everyday"
4.0,Fun design and well-made.
4.0,"the design and style is great but the fit is a little big. I went according to the sizing chart and although the waist fit very snuggly, the back part was very loose and I am a 36c."
4.0,Cute dress but to small on the Bust area
4.0,the price is right on this product..<br />i have a thick hair so so it's not that comfortable for me.. beanie is a little small i think..<br />but after a little adjustment.. it fits perfectly on my head..<br />now i can go and meet my homeless &#34;looking&#34; friends and tell them that i belong to with now<br /><br />don't buy this beanie if you're a meanie..<br />hipsters not haters
4.0,Have not used the bag yet.  The quality appears to be good.
4.0,Just like the picture dime size
4.0,"Nice fit and fabric. I’m about 5’1” and the legs come down to my knees.  Next time, I’ll get the shorter pair."
4.0,The sleeves are harder to get their arms in. They love the design and how it fits. It floats like a dress.
4.0,Loved this style of the shoes goes really well with everything my little guy is wearing... my only complaint it’s not as soft on the inside as the pair from year ago... ☹️
4.0,Nice fit! Worked well.
4.0,"I wear a 16/XL with a 38DDD chest. I purchased both the XL and XXL. The material is nice and soft with a nice stretch to it. The bottom fits ok. The cup of the top is probably the best out of the few different brands I've ordered from recently, however, the band is much too thin for my liking. Had it been wider, it would be perfect. It's wearable but I won't feel comfortable with the band shifting. BTW, had to lengthen the strap all the way because the band was way up in my back."
4.0,Nice watch but cheap.. have several of rocawear watches and this is a replica
4.0,"Returned. Didn't care for the fabric or cut, but just because my waist is high, and this top is for a low-waisted, small hipped lady. Not bad, just didn't like"
4.0,"Fits well, cute, soft, material is a lot heavier than I expected for a sleeveless dress (like sweatshirt material), no way to tell front from back ?, great to hang out in, will be buying again in other colors..."
4.0,Fit well. Rubbed a little bit on the top of my foot
4.0,"The Black Stainless steel band in the Large/X Large band was perfect for my wrist. I expected to re-size the band, but didn't have to.<br />The color is darker than I expected.<br />Only a few pulled hairs, nothing major.<br />I like the fit and finish of the connectors to the Apple Watch.<br />I use the Nylon Apple Band and the Polymer Apple Band and I like the look and feel of this for more formal wear."
4.0,Love it. Not bulky or stiff. Holds everything I need. Perfect for what I was looking for.
4.0,Bought this for a halloween costume but the feathers do fall off easily. I had to get the hot glue gun out to put a few on.
4.0,"So far a like it, not fancy but much smaller than a wallet but holds just as much."
4.0,Please note this shirt will need something under it as it is a little sheer. The color is great and I always get complimented on it. I got the small but I am 5 foot 110 pounds and it is a little larger than I like.
4.0,I really like the overall fit and the competitive price I found them for among Amazon Warehouse deals
4.0,Comfy and nice quality for the price. Runs VERY big. Size small fits more like a medium and slips off my shoulders a bit. But still a good buy for the price.
4.0,"Amazing quality and has padding in the boobs! it was perfect just a little too small for me, im a size 32 DD."
4.0,Little bigger than I thought but still cute. Definitely a way to support DC products! I would definitely buy again.
4.0,I really like this dress but it's TOO small.  I sent it back for a larger size.
4.0,It was ok. I was nervous to buy a white onesie I bought the 3-6 month size. My son wore it for his 4 month photo. The oneise was slightly HUGE! And he was able to wear it until he was about 8 months old. But the pants are VERY tight around the waist. Yet are long.
4.0,Can wear with a lot of different colors. Will enjoy wearing.
4.0,These lens fit well over my glasses and provide a dark protection for my sensitive eyes.  However they do slip slightly.  I do wear them often
4.0,The skirt is cute. The color is darker sky blue than the light blue that is shown or described.
4.0,good but not really 4 foks with fat feet :-(
4.0,I love miss me jeans
4.0,"It’s pretty, but you can tell it’s a cheap watch. The rose gold link band looks really cheap. I LOVE wristology watches tho and I have one of my own with a polka dot face and Grey leather band - I get so many compliments on it. And I LOVE that the bands are ingerchangable!"
4.0,"I’m usually a L/XL and ordered the large. It’s too baggy! I may return for a medium or may just return. I think this is super cute on the model but the way the stitching is near your boobs is not flattering. It makes your stomach look bigger than it is. Would be cute for a pregnant woman but I’m not pregnant and don’t want to look like I am ;) the material is very thick, there are two layers. One that hugs your body tighter underneith, and then the top layer. Took me a hot minute to get it on correctly. debating getting a medium only because it’s comfortable and easy for work."
4.0,I like this belt looks great for that BOHO or hippy look.
4.0,"Cute masks and the kids love them, but they sit too high on the kids face if you use the ear holes. There is a nice little insert for filters if you want I add a filter in there."
4.0,I really like the material and the colors.
4.0,It is a very thick material you might not want to wear on a hot day. Hugs your curves. Trying it on I stretched it and it ripped open a few places so whoever makes them doesn’t sow them secure. But other than that it is a beautiful dress.
4.0,"beautiful colors, quality material and stitching, wonderful fit/drape, silky smooth texture and even though sleeves are long I felt cool/stayed cool on a long warm/humid shopping day.  easy to match several colors of garment print with clothing pcs from my closet as well."
4.0,As far as the product goes my wife loved it ... the problem was that I had ordered it without consulting her on her exact size ... therefore I have scheduled a return and will re-order another one soon ... thanks for the service
4.0,"The top looks fine but the wires on the sides bend a little ,the bottom is a little big for me .i usually wear size 12 .iam 5 feet tall and weight 170 lbs and 38B  for bra"
4.0,It's a good wallet. Just stop messing with the airtag mount. The stitches will come off. Who you got to blame?? Yourself. It's a habit but leave it alone lol
4.0,"look nice, perfect for young grandsons"
4.0,"The neckband looked rather flimsy with liquid gel inside it, but I placed it in the freezer. I spent about 10 minutes with other matters, and went to check online to see how long to wait. I found nothing, so I went to the freezer and the neckband was frozen solid! I'm wearing it now and it does have a cooling effect, but after 5 minutes, I can see it is starting to melt in places. I am mostly satisfied with this purchase, because I only intend to use it at home, indoors, during the worst of summer's heat; my only concern is how resilient the device will be over time."
4.0,"Good little necklace for the price. It's definitely costume jewelry, but I like it!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:c2413ea80a0ceb8cbb152d84e32f778a]] I like that it's soft. I do not like how the straps are non-adjustable. It's not very see-through so that's cool, it fits me like you expected and if you're at tall this probably will be a shirt on you. Feel free to add my snap if you have questions about about anything x mrsrakks3 x"
4.0,"This dress fits exactly as the model represents it, though the color is a tad darker than I was expecting. The denim is very light, making this a good option for spring or fall."
4.0,Nice. But best time I would buy in a larger size
4.0,"Delivery were delayed, but they are cute and practical for the summer"
4.0,"I originally got these to bend onto my resin drops. They are way too thick to bend! However, they are very nice and sturdy as links or charms. I can definitely use them for lots of cool things."
4.0,These do run a little narrow but they are well made good sunglasses.
4.0,"Great belt! Really nice design. Sad thing is I either bought the wrong size myself, or was sent the wrong size. I believe I ordered a 38 waist size... but my belt says 52” to 54” waist. I have to return this. But will be ordering a new one with the correct size hopefully. But the quailty is really great. Far better than the $25 store bought belt that I had previously.<br /><br />Update: I didn’t realize that it was cut to fit 🤦🏾‍♂️😂. So I will be giving it a full on five stars! I’m certainly going to be ordering more of these belts. Cut to fit belts are amazing! I thought it was too big, then realized it before I was going to return it. I felt dumb in the moment of not knowing. But we live and learn. Great product, and I’ve had it a few months and it doesn’t even have that ugly belt crease most belts get from wear and tear. So much durablity in this belt!"
4.0,"The bottom feels like it’ll slip down but otherwise this is a really cute swim suit. Took well over a month to get here, but the price is worth it."
4.0,"This was a bit snug in the bust, and therefore a little too revealing.  I would have kept it anyway and just  put a layering piece under it because it was very cute, but it was definitely not worth $14. Maybe half that price."
4.0,I ordered  a Large.  I'm 5'7&#34; and 150lbs.  Length wise it was okay but was to tight fitting for my liking. I suggest ordering up a size or two. For the price I was very happy and the company is easy to work with!
4.0,"I loved this costume. The size fit as-expected, fabric was soft and stretchy. The wings can be left to fall freely, or can be looped around the arms for movement. It was comfortable and cute.<br /><br />I took off one star for two reasons: first, the headpiece was cheap and fell apart immediately, so in my photo I’m wearing a headband from a different costume. Second, the seams inside the front are unfinished and very itchy, so plan your undergarments to account for that."
4.0,These came exactly as described.  They are exactly what you pay for too.  So just cheap fashion chokers to have fun with and enjoy!  So enjoy and don't expect high quality.
4.0,"Cute dress but it is too long for me.  I am 5'2, 120lbs and I ordered a small."
4.0,"I bought this dress for my senior pictures and I love it! I am 5’2” and about 170. I bought a large and it fit perfectly! It was very comfortable and a good material. I loved the pockets too. The only reason I look off a star is the straps could stand to be a couple of inches longer. Other than that, I love it!"
4.0,Very nice necklace. I love the color and luster of the pearls. I do not think that my item is graduated - the size of pearls is not visibly changing.
4.0,"I loved the colors and style of this dress.<br />I also loved how the arm holes come up higher so that you can wear a normal bra and not see the sides of the bra...that’s hard to find these days!<br />What I didn’t love was the material. It’s not a cotton dress. It’s like that silky stretchy kinda feeling material. I have big hips and that material just clings to them and makes them look even bigger. However, my husband did love the dress on me. But I wouldn’t be able to feel comfortable enough to wear it.<br />I ordered the size I normally wear in clothing. It fit, but I think a size up would’ve been more comfortable."
4.0,"Really nice looking green camo frame with a greenish rainbow sunglass mirror finish.  These are quite large, they remind me of the ones that WWF star Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage used to wear!  They are sturdy and have a good feel to them.  I would use these for bicycling or motorcycling and skiing.  I think they would offer some nice eye protection for all your sporting needs!"
4.0,"I really like these necklaces. I’ve been wearing nonstop since I received them (about a month). They’ve given me a dose of frivolity amid the dark world that is life via Zoom during the age of the pandemic. The shorter one (cz butterfly) does flip if it’s not adjusted to a choker (which if you’re not used to a thicker, metal choker, it may feel like a very skinny man is strangling your neck). I’m used to wearing chokers so it doesn’t bother me. It has unfortunately started to turn colors/show a little tarnish which is disappointing bc I love it. I took off a star bc I don’t see how it could be solid stainless steel if it’s tarnishing at this point. The longer necklace with the five colored butterflies is undeniably fun and trendy. The colors aren’t quite as vivid as the product images, but I prefer them a bit muted so they go with more clothing and aren’t quite as much of an in-your-face statement piece. The five butterfly necklace has not begun to tarnish so maybe it is stainless steel and the other isn’t? Jury is out on the material, but I will say that all five butterfly charms are hanging on and show no signs of breaking off thus far. I am delighted!"
4.0,Comfortable and cute!!
4.0,"For 19.99 this dress is worth it. However, if you are shorter than 5'6' this dress will Drag the ground. It is very long, and the fit is ok. The collar bone area will be exposed due to the fit. The fabric is thick and not sheer at all. A medium size if you typically wear a size large, will probably be ok."
4.0,I liked the earrings but they were just a tad small.  I will look again on Amazon for a slightly larger pair but they are nice.
4.0,Just received this wristband.  It is a light lavender color and appears durable.  It takes a little time to get the Fitbit One inserted but it is snug secure fit.  The band itself lightweight has a clasp to fit multiple sized wrists. I deducted one star because it is almost impossible to clip the band together without help.  Maybe it will get easier after I use it a few times.  I received this at a discount for my honest review.
4.0,"This dress is just what I’d hoped for, but it is way over sized.  I’m normally a 1X, but I ordered a size down based on reports that it runs large.  Should have gone 2 sizes down.  It is also VERY LONG.  I’m 5’7”, and it pooled on the ground.  Could also be that it was big all over.  A large would probably work.  I’m sending it back in exchange for a large.  I got the green/brown color.  It is nice, more brown than green. Fabric is not clingy and not see through,  a blessing for plus sized ladies."
4.0,"Pros:  Beautiful timepiece, standout fashion, 188g heavy & manly, alligator strap flawless, entire watch horizontal width is ~54mm.<br /><br />Cons: 188 g, sharp rivets on start/ stop buttons interfere with the crown, hands do not glow in low light, hard to see hands due to no contrast in background, crown pin very flimsy, only sapphire coating, (chronograph/ hour hand/ Tuesday) hands all line up cant see, setting day is a pain and hand pointing to day is very thin and hard to see.<br /><br />Lamborghini dropped the ball on their web site.  The web site is not complete or a user helpful site to people who already own their products (manuals, registration, helpful hints etc) its only made to sell you items.<br /><br />Overall I bought this because its a beautiful piece of man wear.  Main grip is its very hard to read the hands due to the background camouflages and you can't see the hands at low light."
4.0,They are slightly tight but that's better than them being too loose while working out
4.0,"Look good, doesn't get as dark as others which is good or bad depending."
4.0,Beautiful but don't like the chain! That's easily fixed though
4.0,Love the size and texture of the clutch.  Zipper works well and there's a lot of space inside for cards.  I just wish it was a bit larger - but that's probably not the product's fault.  Just glad my credit cards are now protected.
4.0,My only complaint is they make a lot of noise. This is the first pair of flip flops I've owned that you can hear me coming a block away. Maybe it's the material but they slap the bottom of feet like hands clapping.
4.0,"Made well, beautiful dress.  Buying online I didn’t expect the quality to be this good.  I went by the sizing chart and could have ordered my rack size due to the fact that it laced up."
4.0,"Super cute shirt. However, order a size up! I got this shirt in a medium for my moms and it fit too small. Made her uncomfortable so I should've ordered a Large to have fit okaaaaaaay."
4.0,"As far as disposable masks go, these are just fine. They are definitely not fog resistant as they are marketed, which was a bit frustrating. I am sure as all glasses wearers find, the masks make it incredibly difficult for day to to life with the fog. I like the color, although the pigment could be a little more intense as I have been told it looks like I colored on a white mask with a purple marker"
4.0,I like the grippers on them. They don't slip off my heel and they don't slip around in my shoes. Pretty nice product.
4.0,Looks nice wth my sleeveless shell.
4.0,I really like these cardigans. I have many in the shorter version in medium. The seller was great to work with. These mediums were to big they quickly shipped a small for me to try on with no charge. They made for a smooth transaction.  Very pleased
4.0,Other then big a little small my little girl loves them
4.0,"Very handsome shirt, whish it came in a 2x."
4.0,Good but tight if you got a large size head its tight as hell.
4.0,Socks are mid calf level
4.0,Very cute. A bit narrow but size seems on target
4.0,I bought the larger size hoping it would fit.<br /><br />Fits smaller than size ordered. But still great item if it fits.
4.0,"This is the shirt I chose to wear home from hospital after rotator cuff/tenodesis surgery.  Wore it for the first 3 days until I took my first shower. Snaps are tiny bit of challenge as surgery was on my dominant side and I didn't have quite the grip I needed to make all snaps work, Had to have help"
4.0,i love this... but wont wear in public...  just my back porch!!  its super cute
4.0,"I love the look of this belt, but the fit was off to me. The excess part of the belt goes UNDER the other side and not over it like most belts of this style. That causes the excess to sit right on my hip bone, which hurt. I cut some excess off and now it's good. But this could be my fault for not buying a smaller size."
4.0,I love just spinning it around my finger. I'm not a hard person to entertain so I could spin it around for hours haha. The red in the heart and diamonds and the black in the club and spade unfortunately started to scrap off of the ring but I still wear it. Still like the look of it also the spinning lol.
4.0,They are pretty good quality will have to see how long they last. Bought for my work keys. Overall good quality out of the package.
4.0,The gown fits correctly feels soft and cozy
4.0,I live in Australia and was hesitant about purchasing these shoes from overseas. I needed some pink shoes for a 'pink' party. I was not disappointed at all with the shoes. They are so comfortable and easy to wear. The size was a true fit. I would recommend them to anyone.
4.0,"Great jacket...but was WAY TOO SMALL.... this jacket runs about 2 sizes smaller than stated.  I had to return them (I bought 2) and because they were so popular, I was not about to order or exchange them for larger size.  The refund and return process took much longer than the order and delivery.  But it is &#34;all good&#34; now.  Thanks !"
4.0,"While I like these earrings, I though the stone was opaque not like a crystal. I needed an opaque stone, but they are pretty. I just have several with clear crystals and didn't need another."
4.0,"I sized up to a medium because of the other reviews and it was definitely a good idea. The suit fits me fairly well, even though I am normally a size small. However, the lace portion on the stomach kind of gets loose and crinkles up when I sit down or bend in certain ways. This is a little strange, but I will still probably wear the suit. Overall it is cute and I am definitely happy I sized up."
4.0,"These are absolutely awesome. I can't wait to wear them. They should have packaged them better for shipping. Some of the petals had broken upon arrival, but you can't tell when wearing them."
4.0,I am impressed with how nice this watch looks especially for the price. I hadn't noticed when looking online there's no day/date but that is what makes it so clean looking. I got this for my husband who loves to have unique looking watches and he is excited to add this one to his collection.
4.0,"These are spectacular boots and you simply can’t go wrong here.<br />Unless...you want a trim looking footbed.  My one gripe with this pair of cowboy boots is they don’t look like “authentic” cowboy boots in it’s STYLE.  I prefer a more narrow footbed and tighter shaft.  I realize we’re all built differently, but I have very tiny ankles and feet.  I’d have appreciated a tighter fit and wouldn’t have returned them otherwise.<br />But don’t let my stats prevent you from purchasing!  These truly are eye catching boots!!!!"
4.0,"These tank tops are described as ""long"" but they're not. Kinda short, actually. Maybe long for miniature people! Other than that they're comfortable and whisk sweat away very nicely."
4.0,"I LOVED this dress....and really wanted to keep it.  The blue is an AMAZING shade!...fits everywhere, except the chest.  Just like the other reviewers mentioned (but I reallly wanted it and didn't want to listen....lol).  If you are well endowed do not purchase this dress folks....it isn't something that even a seamstress can fix....for reference, I'm a 38 DD....fits PERFECTLY everywhere else....just too small up top, unfortunately."
4.0,The material is not as soft as I hoped it would be.
4.0,These belts are just what I have been looking for! The belts appear to be well made and good quality. The size of the belt is 56 inches and were very easy to cut to size. There were no instructions on how to do the size reduction but I have had other belts of this type. Instructions would be nice. So far the belts have kept their shape and I have not had any color run issues. They are comfortable and the buckle is easy to use. I expect to get long wear out of them. The cost of these belts was just right. The only reason for four stars instead of five is that I think it would be better if the buckle were the same color as the belt.
4.0,"The material is soft and I love the color. However,  the dress runs a little small and is too short to be a dress.  Great with a pair of leggings though!"
4.0,"Your band is first class. The buckle and pins are top quality.  BUT, the large band that I bought does not match the large band that came with my Fitbit Versa. It is shorter. I prefer a band I can adjust as my wrist swells during the day. The has no adjustments for me."
4.0,"I gave it four stars only because I had to reorder and downsize from a large to a medium.  I am 5'10 slim slender but curvy. I always wear medium or large, but this definitely runs big. Large was way to lose. I didn't realize this until other people mentioned this in their posts as well. So be sure to downsize. Overall, the dress is beautiful and I would recommend!"
4.0,"This is a good shirt for work or dressing up. It can also be dressed down to make it more casual. It fits as expected and seems true to size. The sleeves are perhaps a tad bit long, but not in a noticeable way. The fabric is a little heavier, so it will definitely be worn with an undershirt. Overall, good shirt at a good value."
4.0,"Very beautiful color.  This shawl/scarf is not too wide, so it can be used as a shawl, but not perhaps for winter.  Very nice quality, too.<br />Love it."
4.0,I bought for myself. But its very small. Can fit a very thin wrist of a 10 years old girl. So she loves it. Everybody compliments her on it.
4.0,"I had the same issue that another reviewer had. I ordered the red Santa printed skirt and instead I received a red snowman print. The skirt fits, the material and the construction are a good quality, it's just not the print I ordered. I will not be returning it because I need it for a party in a couple days and it's not a huge deal to me personally, I still think it's cute, it's just not what I ordered. So if you're in a time crunch, just beware that this has happened to at least a couple people so be prepared or order in advance in case it's wrong. Besides that, I was impressed with the quality of the skirt for the price."
4.0,Great buy! Quality of the bracelets is really good. I sold 3 of them but I wear the rest and have been wearing them for almost a year now. No breaking or damage what so ever.
4.0,I returned it because I didn't like the design of the coin area.  Since there's no pleat the coin area is very tight and difficult and uncomfortable to use. But the wallet itself is really well made and of high quality.
4.0,"Fine though looked old, and not all worked - with being that many of them already having a battery I would imagine some would die."
4.0,I never ever write a review however I absolutely LOVE this travel visor!!!!!! It’s so perfect for travel and gets lots of compliments!!! I only give 4 out of 5 because elastic that holds it together when rolled up stretches out but otherwise my fav summer accessory:)
4.0,I thought this was going to be a keeper! For reference I'm 5'3 107lbs and a 33B. I ordered a Small. There are molded cups in the suit which was a nice feature. The color is vibrant and material was a heavier weight. Great fit all over IF there was at least another 2 inches in the torso. The top of the cups made it right below my chest. I definitely appreciate the quality of the suit. Even the straps along the sides were generous and comfortable. The bottom was cheeky and I'm sure looks great on the right person. Seriously contemplated deconstructing the suit and making it a two piece because its unique. The search continues!
4.0,"It came very quickly and looks beautiful. It's a gift, so don't know how it fits.<br />My only problem was when I followed all the directions for an exchange but it was treated as a return so I had to reorder. But I would shop with them again."
4.0,Good pajama top for Hallmark Christmas movie watchers. Washes nice.
4.0,"The capri ones are pretty good for the price.  Opaque, true to size and comfortable.  I wish they came in ankle length for short sizes in a 2x."
4.0,The fit is as expected and the quality is great for the price. The color is definitely blue and not green so one star deducted for that. But still pleased with the shirt overall.
4.0,"I absolutely loved this band! I am however disappointed that the leather started coming apart almost immediately, I will have to stop wearing it in a few weeks (have had it less than 6 months)"
4.0,Basic and functional. Exactly what I wanted
4.0,The green top is pretty bright green.
4.0,i bought this mask to complete my cat costume.  It was cute.
4.0,"These are lightweight plastic, but mine arrived intact and I wore them in a wedding at a Renn Faire as intended. I keep them in a box when not using them so they aren't broken, and other than that have had no issues with them. They do look nice for the price."
4.0,Bought this to wear with my white prom dress with gold accents. I like it it but don't love it. It is indeed very bulky and the design looks just a tad awkward when it's on your ears but nonetheless it's still really beautiful. The color is true to the picture and no gems have fallen off yet so yay! Hahahah
4.0,"The look and feel pretty decent.  Only complaints are that the nose piece is screwed onto the frame, that doesn't look like it'll last.  Also, didn't realize the lenses were going to be so transparent, you can see the wearer's eyes through them.  Other than that, not bad for $25."
4.0,wears run too small 3x = 1x good quality t shirt
4.0,Good wallet and nice leather. Feels good and pretty slim. Awesome that it has rfid. Enough space for cards and money. Would definitely recommend buying.
4.0,Flexible stretchy material. Dries fast. Cool for riding. I bought two
4.0,"Awesome shoes, however the lights burn out way too quick even when they're off most of the time."
4.0,"Other than the fabric feeling a bit rough, I love the quality and fit of these socks-- the design too- If I wear the bottom of the sock on top, there is a different design showing!  Cool!"
4.0,"This was for my daughter, and though it fits her well, it was way too long, down to her ankles, and hard to hem due to the pleats. She's 5 ft tall and very slender, and I think she had an extra small or small. The color (scarlet) is very nice."
4.0,Nice costume.  Order one or two sizes smaller.  Size chart is BS!
4.0,"Nice comfy shorts to walk in, the material helps keep me cooler than some of the other shorts I’ve worn.  Deep pockets too, only drawback is when I put my phone in one it tends to rub on my leg, minor issue.  I’ll definitely be ordering another pair or two."
4.0,Really cool black on black Dodger hat. Took for ever to get it though.
4.0,So I went with this one since it was cheaper and you can feel it slightly in the material but honestly it’s not bad. I will say I measured 3 times before ordering and it did slightly fit too big but not shabby. Maybe order one size down.
4.0,"First, these fit somewhat as expected; for reference, I wear a size L gloves in Wells-Lamont, John Deere and other brand name gloves, and these in Large fit similarly in the palm, but the fingers seem tighter - mostly due to the articulation inserts sewn in to make them more hand-shaped, I suspect.<br /><br />The seam where the two middle fingers are sewn into the palm is also intrusive and makes the fingers seem tight to get into, and I worry about the bulk of some of those inside seams chafing or causing blisters when worn while working for long periods. So far no problem and the leather does seem to be softening up and conforming, so maybe not - but if you have sensitive hands, beware!<br /><br />The weirdest thing for me is how long the thumb is! The tip of the thumb extends almost an inch beyond the end of my thumb, and I don't have oddly stumpy thumbs by any means. There are times that extra length is very much in the way and annoying, although for gripping tools or steering wheels, etc, it's not too bothersome. Just weird.<br /><br />These feel like they will hold up and wear for a long time, which is good, but for the same money I can probably get 2 or 3 pairs of better-fitting gloves that will, between them, last at least as long. For my particular hand size/shape, that's probably the route I'll go, but if these fit your hands they're probably fine."
4.0,"I like the dress cute and casual. shows bra under the arm pits a little long, but still cute. I will wear it a lot. Great material"
4.0,Love them!! The only reason I have them 4 starts instead of 5 is because they aren't as sturdy as I was suspecting them to be. But they haven't broke yet! Great buy 👌🏼
4.0,"Es mejor de lo que esperaba, excelente calidad,  muy satisfecha con la compra..."
4.0,"They are all stitched the same way, still cute but could have variety"
4.0,Si es lo que esperaba
4.0,Bought for my niece. She loves it. Simply bag for carrying dolls and toys!
4.0,"These were great for the price. The only complaint would be when they arrived, there was no description of what they were, or any pictures to show what the are so that could be confusing as I was giving them as part of a gift. I outlined my hand on card stock paper so I could show that they were gloves. It was a bit hard to find the thumb hole. I liked them and bought several, even keeping a pair for myself!"
4.0,"For me I return to order up a size if you want the baggy look. The material is light weight, comfortable and breathable"
4.0,The stones were smaller and less visible than pictured. Otherwise good value for the money.
4.0,I liked the pendant but the clasp is too small.
4.0,They are very cute but I was only sent 19 crowns instead of 20.  I had a very sad little girl.
4.0,"Looks really good, and the greatest thing is, I get compliments al the time."
4.0,"I like my new clutch. It holds everything a much larger purse would. The blue color is so pretty, I'd like to get the red also. It does have a small defect on the lobster claw clasp for the wrist strap but it is not noticeable. I had ordered one for my daughter and, it too, had the same defect."
4.0,"It's a lovely bag--I like my leather a little softer, but for the price, it was well worth the purchase.  Pretty, fun color and right-sized for every day for me."
4.0,"These gloves are warm, water proof, & have a pretty good grip. But the liner seems to float around inside the glove to much, allowing the fingers to get displaced from the shell. So they have to be manipulated back into place for the glove to feel right. Otherwise, they are a pretty nice glove."
4.0,"Quality was good, bright clear prints, fun!"
4.0,good for kids
4.0,Made in China.  Not authentic.  But very pretty.  Posts were bent.
4.0,it only expand certain places.
4.0,This is a very nice pendant. Picture is a pretty accurate likeness of it.  It's a little on the heavy side because it's mostly metal. I ended up taking it off the chain and connecting it to a key ring.
4.0,"The earrings themselves are exactly how I had expected them. I ordered these for their tiny size and the price can't be beaten. They're so adorable! The color is a deep burgundy but when the light hits it, it becomes a nice red ruby-ish color.<br /><br />The reason I gave this 4 stars is that the safety backings are a bit different than pictured. They are also too long and do not keep my earrings secure when I wear them. I have been using the backings from different earrings I have in the meantime and haven't had any problems. These earring backings could be a good replacement: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B078ND9QQC/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A31ONVXAEMN786&psc=1"
4.0,"This item did not fit it was too big. Like two sizes, I purchased a size seven and that what she wears.<br />They were very pretty shorts . I wish they wouldn’t have fit"
4.0,What's expected  for the price
4.0,Needed for a costume. Product as described. Arrived on time.
4.0,Very pretty and striking. Rich color.
4.0,"I ordered XL to have it be a bit bigger.  I'm a pretty skinny guy (6'3"" 175lbs) and it was a bit more snug than I was hoping, about the width of a large t-shirt but without the ability of the fabric to stretch much.  If you want it loose I would go up 2 sizes, one size up gives a proper fit in my opinion.  The fabric and stitching is quality though so I am still happy."
4.0,My son wanted this for his birthday gift.  He really liked it and it fit him really well.
4.0,Product fits well. May have to take in the top.<br />Drapes nicely. Can’t beat the price. Will know more after a few washes!
4.0,Looks great on my guitar
4.0,A good bit larger than expected but still very pretty. Nivea teacher's gift.
4.0,"This dress/cover up is cute. It is an odd material and on the short side (I'm 5'9""), which is why I feel it's more suited as a cover-up."
4.0,Very warm jacket with nice slight waist shaping. Would be a 5 star if zipper was bottom up as well as top down.
4.0,"Flattering, tight fit. Fabric wrinkles easy. Comfortable. Hugs body shape. Love the detailed cap sleeves"
4.0,"I wish this was USCG certified and that keeps it from being 5/5 stars.  Otherwise, it's got a ton of pockets and seems to be holding up well.  The padding in the PFD is comfortable."
4.0,I feel like I got what was expected and shown in the picture! I wouldn’t say it’s meant to be the warmest socks or even that cozy. But for a more thin sock with a good print to wear with boots in the fall and winter I would say it’s over all good! I don’t think I would recommend them for keeping the toes warm on a snowy day but I think you get what you pay for here.
4.0,Love the color and delivered on time. Not a huge fan of the stretchy material and it fits a little snug for my taste. Ordered the XL hoping to be a little big but it wasn't.
4.0,Love the material and how it makes me feel
4.0,very pretty and dainty I love the veil
4.0,I love that the colors you see in person are what you see in the online picture. I wish the pendant was a bit larger though.
4.0,as depicted folds flat if needed. Sturdy when in use and nice magnetic closure.
4.0,"soft comfortable, not much shrinkage noticed nice large pockets"
4.0,"The bag is sturdy. As it’s canvas, I expected it to be a bit stiff, but this bag is border line cardboard stuff. I assume with time it will wear and become more flexible.<br /><br />I hope this means it will be durable. I put a hard time on bags and tend to go through them pretty quickly. It’s not as wide as I had hoped, I have a Nikon d750 with extended battery, 24-85 and 70-200 lenses. They barely all for inside the bag, but it works. Again, I think as the bag gives a bit more, these three pieces will fit comfortably."
4.0,"Great quality garment... I am 5'11 152 lbs and with very little body fat.  I ordered both a medium  and a large as I never know... I found very little difference in the two sizes.  The medium is just a tad tighter around the middle and Ian  am sending it back.  I also ordered this dress in a large in pink, aqua and black.  Love the dress!  It does show everything... so be ready, pubic mound shows, any panties etc.  If you don't want it to be really, consider ordering even 2 sizes up.  More of a Jr sizing to be sure than a misses."
4.0,"I bought the plus size due to the recommendations and they were still small. 5""7""/200lbs. That being said, I can wear them as pants, but the legs are short and snug. No way could this be a romper, though."
4.0,I ordered a large instead of a medium. On one hand I'm glad I did because it fits how it should in the hips. On the other hand it's much bigger up top. I like it though. It's cute with flowy pants. :)
4.0,Easy to use and fits good.
4.0,I love this jeans...
4.0,The band looks good and it did fit the watch that I ordered this for. It just took me some time to get the springs installed.
4.0,These were super easy to apply. I liked that each screen protector comes with its own application kit - included a dust cloth and application tabs.  I was able to easily apply it the first time without any air bubbles.  The only downside was that I ordered the purple ones and these look clear even after application.  Not a deal breaker though - as long as my screen is protected.
4.0,Good fit. Looks more expensive than it actually was.
4.0,"It's good for what it's used for. Very versatile in the different ways it can be worn. I like that it can be worn as a wrist band when not in use. If it had just a little more stretch to it, it would be a 5-Star. Other than that, it's a great alternative to the face mask need."
4.0,"The bag is very nice, however I ordered 4 of the SAME bags and one was totally different! I contacted seller and got a somewhat rude response back. I realize these came from another country but more tact on their part would have been nice! This was their response:Order ID 103-2886634-5388257:<br />4 of Fawziya® Big Purses With Bows Soft Crystal Evening Clutch Bags-Silver [ASIN: B00LB0VTXK]<br /><br />------------- Begin message -------------<br /><br />happy New Year！<br /><br />Are you saying that one of them will be a little bigger?<br /><br />Because it is handmade, so there will be a little different, and it is normal.<br /><br />We have checked your goods, we delivered your goods without problem,<br /><br />if you do not like it , you would be returned to us.<br /><br />Because shipping system settings reason,<br /><br />we are already selling your goods at a loss to you,<br /><br />but we have delivered to you, about your price, this bags has been well worth to buy it. Geez! I tell them that one is different and didn't say one word about the quality and they choose to argue!! Not good!"
4.0,"I would get a half size up from  your normal size. I would water proof these shoes if you want to use them for outdoor activities. The insert in the shoe isn't very sturdy. These shoes are very comfortable. Overall, for $10 it is a decent shoe."
4.0,"Love the dress, I ordered three of these dresses, each in small. They each fit a bit differently though, this one was a bit too big. I'm 5'3 134 lbs. The light blue fit perfectly though!"
4.0,"Cute, comfortable and fashionable dress. Everything ok but fabric could have a little bit better quality to be perfect."
4.0,"Good quality but not great. Fit is one size smaller than advertised. Nice, silky feel & medium heavy fabric. Wash well & very warm & comfy. I would order again but one size up."
4.0,"Cute, comfy and chic!"
4.0,short waisted.
4.0,It’s a very cute style but runs very small.  I didn’t want to guess which size might be right since I think I would have had to go up at least 2 sizes from my current size.
4.0,Great for the money. Provides sweat absorption as well as keep my hair out of my eyes during exercise.
4.0,"This shirt is super cute and fits pretty well. I got so many compliments! The only complaint I have is the peplum is pretty big and definitely doesn’t make me look skinny, but the cuteness of she shirt helps me overlook it!"
4.0,"Ordered this gear shift for my son's vehicle---he loves it.  Well constructed, very solid.  I would order again--fast delivery and product as described."
4.0,"I wanted to wear this a few times to really get a feel for it before I reviewed, I apologize I don't have a photo but I will try to be as detailed in my review as I can. For reference, I am 5'4"" 130lbs and a 32DD and I ordered a medium.<br /> So first off the material is SO soft. It is smooth and doesn't irritate my skin in anyway, breathable and comfortable for sure. However, I took the padding out of the top. It was super big and very strange. Instead of being 2 separate pads it was one long one that got skinny in the middle. The side that is supposed to be against you also has hearts (I assume where the nips go) and then little bumps under those, probably to add some lift. It didn't feel necessary for me and even my husband said he felt like the padding looked weird. I will probably swap the padding our for 2 individual pads that are slimmer if I ever want to use it outside my house.<br /> I did love the low back on this, I think it feels very comfortable and its nice that it doesn't sit on that same bra line all the time. However, I think because it is a low back and such a soft stretchy material, it makes it so the bottom rolls. It was fine and would stay in place as long as I was standing and not moving much,  but as soon as I was moving around (working out, cleaning, putting a desk together, even just sitting down) I noticed the bottom solid piece band would start to roll up. I get that because the material is flexible it causes it to move more, however I would not feel comfortable going to the gym wearing this as a top because the band rolls so much. I would rather have it not be a low back, and have the band stay in place, than have a low back with the band constantly rolling up. Maybe it is the way I am shaped, but it was a little annoying for me. That is the only reason I have docked a star.<br /> Despite that I will definitely wear it around the house to lounge around but I will likely not wear it outside of the house.<br /> I will of course update my review if my opinion changes at all."
4.0,"VERY large.  I wanted the big glasses but they were too big for me.  It might work for others but they are just a bit too large for me.  They fit ok....just the lenses that are huge.  I was contacted by the owner after submitting my review and offered a refund (months past the return period from amazon).  I actually still wear these glasses so I didn't feel right accepting the refund, but wanted to note how great and responsive customer service was.  Overall the glasses are decent, just didn't fit my face right."
4.0,There is no bottle opener or can’t find it
4.0,"The padding has stayed in place pretty well, but it is thicker than I'd like."
4.0,"My son loved this costume but be prepared for it to be an issue in some settings. He tried to wear it to a school event (he's 12) and they said he couldn't wear it because it covered his face. We also had a costume party at our house, and it just wasn't suitable to moving around in a confined area, especially with a young dog. He had to take breaks during trick or treat because he became too warm."
4.0,"Nice ring! It's very comfortable and pretty much exactly what I wanted. Just be aware that the ring is very wide, so if if you are looking for something feminine-looking and feeling then you'll want something else. I personally like that about it except my fingers and short and stubby so it looks a bit odd, but hey, that's what you get for buying online."
4.0,It’s slightly irregular but I expected that for $15. It will do the job for today.
4.0,These earrings look very nice for the price paid
4.0,"They are a floppy rubber material, and when they arrived the packaging said ""Unicorn Hooves""... and they are cloven, not horse hooves.  They look like the ones shown in the picture in every other way, but they are more like cow hooves, not horse hooves (I don't know what kind of hooves unicorns have... I would have thought like horse hooves, but maybe they are cloven too!  ;-)  )  Maybe if I'd gotten the ones that were packaged as Horse hooves they would have been solid hooves.  Otherwise they seem to be as shown.  I will use them, counting on no one to notice that they aren't horse hooves.  They are bigger than I expected, so there is plenty of room to move hands around inside, and they go a good ways up my arm, nearly to my elbow (granted.... I do sort of have T-Rex arms)."
4.0,"Well made, pretty pink color. Fabric only stretches a little. Buy up one size."
4.0,Expensive but this was the one I needed. Very pretty and well made but if you have a rounder head (like I do) it's an awkward fit.
4.0,It is as I expected it to be. The earing could be smaller so it will not dominate the look. I'm pleased with it.
4.0,Good material. Cute top.
4.0,"They are sooooo beautifu, she said. Couldn't ask for more!"
4.0,"I got these for my kids (6 & 8),  even though they are not marketed for children.  The adjustable sides make them functional, though they are a little big for their face.  They are a thicker material.  The boys like the camo."
4.0,Adorable.  Nicely made and thick fabric.  Paired with denim colored shorts (Gerber) it makes a darling outfit!
4.0,"My brother was very apprehensive about buying online. The boots fit well, I gave this as a gift. Our local Herb Philipson's closed and my brother needed boots. He said he got them out of the box they looked just like the picture. They fit well, wear good."
4.0,"They work well, they are comfortable and they look good."
4.0,Looks great especially for the price. I had a necklace like this that I purchased at a craft store and added crystals to for my bridal jewelry. Super lovely and dramatic on the cheap. Unfortunately that first one was not good quality and came apart resulting in a lost section. I was so happy to find a replacement that is heavier weight and better quality. I look forward to wearing this striking necklace for years to come.
4.0,It's really decent for the lower price
4.0,"This is a nice looking purse. There are lots of compartments so it organizes your things very well. My only complaint is that it is very heavy...empty! I will use it for an occasional purse, not an every day one."
4.0,It's great exactly what I expected.
4.0,"Cute bag, great size for a young girls or adults. My daughter loves it!!"
4.0,"This shirt is pretty, but somewhat thin, if you're not one to like your bra showing through, you'll just have to wear a lighter bra."
4.0,It is really squishy. The egg inside can dry out. Very visual so if you have trouble finding a key on a desk in a pile of other things this will work for you.
4.0,"This was a birthday  gift for my 93 year old mother.  It was a perfect gift, and she adores it.  It is very stylish, very easy to read with a nice clear face on watch.  Comes in three different colors.  Looks very elegant.  Were are very happy with our purchase."
4.0,I love the way it looks on me super flattering but the only thing is the top. Omg the top is so small and I'm getting a bit of under boob. I'm a size 38 D. Other than the top I absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it.
4.0,These are super soft and very comfortable. Great deal!
4.0,"Purchased for 2 international, and 4 domestic flights recently and it came through perfectly, no apparent scratches and definitely no damage. Very nice interior layout and served me well. Recommended."
4.0,"The material is pretty stretchy, so I ended up buying  mine a little to big. Otherwise it is a great skirt, with or without the petticoat. I plan on buying another one in a different color."
4.0,"I like it very much but I dont like the sistem to brooch to open and close, my fingernails hurts, I have to change for a magnet brooch and now I dont have problem"
4.0,I love them but I expected them to be a tad larger.
4.0,"When the weather starts to get really chilly, one of the first things I grab is a comfy beanie to keep my heard and ears warm. This acrylic beanie by Wolverine is very comfy and nicely made with no loose threads that I sometimes see with other inexpensive hats. I went with the camel color; the actual color is a bit darker (almost light olive green) versus the tan I saw on the product page. It didn’t bother me, as I like green and was actually debating between the camel and the green before going with the former. There is a Wolverine logo near the lower edge of the beanie. It looks pretty subtle and blends in well with the camel/light olive green color. There’s another small black tag on the other side of the hat. I’ve attached a couple photos so you can see for yourselves.  The hat fit very well on my average sized noggin, and the acrylic doesn’t scratch or make my ears itchy when pulled down over them. The hat is a bit lighter weight than I was expecting, so I probably will go with my other beanies that are a bit thicker when the mercury really takes a dip. I do love how comfy this feels, and it’ll definitely become part of my mild to chilly winter rotation. The price point is very competitive, especially given its quality construction."
4.0,Cute socks. Wish they were a little taller to go all the way to my knees.
4.0,"helps prolong the life of a well made Casio model watch - matches perfectly, and saves money and waste of resources"
4.0,I am very happy with these. Nice quality and fits well. I would give it a 5 star if the waiste band was wider.
4.0,"Loved it came exactly as described, it was the perfect gift."
4.0,kinda cool for the money id buy them again
4.0,"If you are buying this, make sure you size up!"
4.0,"This organizer can keep practically anything in its place, and remains compact enough to put in my lap top bag.  I can keep all those wires and connectors neat without their getting snarled and tangled.  In additon, if necessary, I can slip a CD in and away we go.  I highly recommend this item, not just for geeks, but also for those items that always seem to escape or go missing right when you need it."
4.0,I wear a 71/2 - 8 and Tge small was way to small. No medium available going to try a large and see. Got the 5mm
4.0,Pretty long for a 5 foot female. But still comfortable
4.0,Socks are great. I'm disappointed I didn't receive the blue pair and received two pairs of orange instead.
4.0,Longer than expected and also feels like a compression stocking.
4.0,"Very cute and well made, but a little on short on the length."
4.0,"Mi pie es muy delgado me quedan algo flojos , pero son de muy buena calidad"
4.0,I had orginal Fitbit bangle and it broke within 6mos.and it had a hefty price. The V-Moro bangle has a more user friendly clasp and it looks great.
4.0,"Pretty cool for a costume, but wouldn't stay on my head."
4.0,"The bag is as advertised, attractive and good quality leather so for that it gets five ***** stars. It came packaged in a large Amazon envelope without any filling paper or foam in the purse to help keep the shape. As a result the purse was smashed and has developed creases where there should not be creases. For that it gets three *** stars. Good product poor execution."
4.0,"Very cute headbands that do the job reasonably well. They are a tiny bit tight, but I expected that from previous reviews. The only thing that would make them better was if they had some silicone grip tape along the inside back to help keep them from sliding off."
4.0,"I LOVE these hats. The cream color is my absolute favorite. I just wished they had some fleece lining, that would have been the icing on the cake for them. Being outside for “mask breaks” gets very very cold! I would still ecommend them!!! I received many compliments on it!!"
4.0,Super cute! The skirt is a little high cut for me but nothing a safety pin or a few stitches can’t fix!
4.0,"I get a lot of compliments on the design of this apron. I would have given it 5 stars except for 2 things: all the leather bits mean it needs to hang dry after washing, and it's a bit short for most adults. Still, it's well made and a sturdy barrier to food and liquids. Lots of pockets and comfortable to wear."
4.0,"First thing to mention is that these socks are very slippery. When wearing them in your shoes, your feet with bounce around it constantly, as the lack of grip makes it very uncomfortable at times when you consciously notice it.<br /><br />The socks are super comfortable when off the ground without shoes on. It very breathable and perfect if you're too lazy to take them off at the end of the day when jumping into bed.<br /><br />On the ground it's good if you have carpeted floors as you may slip if you dash to the other room when on hardwood floors.<br /><br />Presentation is very good. Comes individually wrapped and aligned well in a black box. Perfect for gifting, especially for the holidays and/or father's day.<br /><br />Overall very comfortable pack of socks, but keep in mind that it may be slippery depending on the condition you're in<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review"
4.0,Excellent quality great graphics. It is a fitted cut so it runs small.
4.0,Sewing could be better
4.0,"It's a bit too bulky and the lanyard is way too long, but it is strong and hold my phone well."
4.0,Fits large and sleeves are short. Good quality and cute though. Ordered a S and I am 5’6” 125 lbs.
4.0,"cute dress. Cheaper material but a low price. I will hand wash as it appears it is pretty delicate. Cute shape and pattern. Bought for tossing on for warm, tropical vacation nothing formal or upscale. Rolls up nice to pack and use without wrinkles. Not high end but then again I didn't pay high end."
4.0,It tends to slip as you walk.  I'd suggest some double-sided tape.
4.0,"Was a hit at the holiday parties. The material isn’t the nicest, but face it, you weren’t buying this join your daily wear wardrobe."
4.0,"I love the simple design. It looks very modern and clean when worn. But I'm not a big fan of the chain because it feels a little flimsy. Other than that, this is a beautiful and stable necklace."
4.0,"The product itself is great and came quickly. My only word of advice is to buy a pair that's BIGGER than whatever size your lenses are. I have 52mm lenses in my glassses and I bought the 52mm flip downs and they are too small. I didn't see that noted anywhere which would've been helpful before purchasing. Other than that, recommend!"
4.0,It's a little thin and see- through in the tighter areas. I got a great deal on it though!
4.0,Really cute! A little small though
4.0,"Bra i good, came with an extender which i nice, butt the cup are pretty small, so bigger C cups? go for D if and when they have it."
4.0,"A good belt but not as durable as I had hoped, more of a dress belt."
4.0,somewhat large but once I purchase a nice belt it should work just fine.
4.0,El size es perfecto
4.0,It's perfect in every way but the chain length. Had to order another chain separately from a different vendor. (30&#34;)
4.0,Very good all around shoes. Easy on and easy off.
4.0,Cute dress and comfortable.
4.0,This product needs a handle.
4.0,I just wish you could get a better price for more quantity! 2pk for $10 is expensive!
4.0,really snug on the shoulders. but really nice over all
4.0,"The product fits as expected, nice fit!  Just was a bit more like a t-shirt than I had expected. Didn't fit my needs but would definitely reconsider for purchase for more of a casual look."
4.0,I think they are the best of the clip on sunglasses.  The are more versatile than most allowing you to see shaded areas more clearly.
4.0,"As many reviewers stated, the color is incorrect. These are black with blue splatter. For $15 though, I’m really not about to complain. They worked perfectly for a music video shoot. Only problem I encountered was that the headband itself pops off your head if unsecured. So I recommend Bobby pinning some of your hair over the band to secure it, as in the picture I’ve attached. The important thing for us was the silhouette which was definitely achieved!"
4.0,Buy 2 size smaller
4.0,"bought this for my 12 year old. fabric is nice and as described. However, the collar is way too big. No way this fits a child."
4.0,"Love the shirt! It runs small though. I would usually wear a medium, but need a large in this shirt."
4.0,"Nice material, stretchy and ribbed. Too big on my shoulders and rather loose. I normally get a small or medium in tops and I got a small and I probably need an extra small for it to fit right. Size down."
4.0,Hello<br />Must say it is very hard to find leggings that is  very soft and easy to pull up for an plus size person. These is the way to go  ladies
4.0,I've gotten compliments on this dress.  It was a tad longer than I like but still really cute and colorful.
4.0,I'm 5'5 210lbs and the large fit perfectly.
4.0,Great. Fits everything that I need to have on me
4.0,"I loved this suit right out of the box, until I tried it on.  I am 5'8"" and this suit was not long enough in the torso.  I needed at least two more inches in length for it to fit comfortably and not pull at the shoulders.  So sad, because it really is a lovely suit and flattering design but it does not come in Tall sizes.  For those ladies 5'6"" and under, enjoy!"
4.0,I had to replace the Emerson pajama because I totally wore it to shreds.  It was the most comfortable pj I ever wore.  My new one is much larger even tho they both were &#34;One Size fits all&#34;.  But I know it will be fine.
4.0,My boys loved it but it broke as soon as they started using it. They still loved it broken though.
4.0,Very comfortable and totally cute! Well padded to wear all day.
4.0,They work perfectly when I’m trying to get swole and want to check out my buffness in the mirror
4.0,"It works great. The bands broke while lifting, but we're cheap to replace."
4.0,Loose from waist
4.0,"I love this mask. It is very soft, incredibly so, which makes it very comfortable. I love the sequins, which are on a stretchy netting. If you are wearing this for actual protection, you will need to wear it over a surgical mask, or insert a filter of some sort. Purchased filters, tissue, coffee filter. There is a filter pocket. Without a filter or under mask, it’s just pretty facewear.<br /><br />The nose and chin do have pointed seams, so yeah, it may be less flattering than a flat mask, but better coverage. It’s a mask not a beauty contest.<br /><br />The main problem for me is the smell. It’s awful. Hoping washing it in soap then in scented water will take away the chemical smell. I can’t wear it as is. No one else seems to have noticed this, so it could be a one off."
4.0,I love these boots! But this one came with the side of the heel squished down and it rubbed against my foot. Returning- but def buying another!
4.0,Beautiful well made dress. Very comfortable. Fit my sister way better on top and gave her a great shape so she wore the dress.
4.0,"My daughters, age 4 and 6, really liked the colors and the choices. I really liked that there were enough pairs to last as rewards for quite a while. So far, and in comparison with others we've tried, they are easy to remove from the backing and they stay put! Huge plus!"
4.0,Good but...Meh...not that many uses out of it.
4.0,"I've got small feet so I never expected these to fit me right. surprisingly my shoes, put them all in 4 different pairs of shoes too."
4.0,Not quite like the picture.
4.0,Great deal. Love the highwaist. Lightweight stretch. Below knee.
4.0,"I have seen these boots in boutiques for $40+, so when I found them here for half the price, I had to snatch them up! I'm 5'10&#34; and I'm always looking for a low heeled boot- these are perfect. Not too high, but high enough to count. They aren't shiny like I thought they'd be, and they do seem to run a little large; however, if I would have gone down a size they'd be too snug. They are so cute and perfect for summer!! I almost wish I would have sprung for the blush colored ones! These are more versatile and will go with more outfits, though! Buy these boots. For real."
4.0,"I bought these for my 6 year old grandson, they’ve worked well as he’s rough on shoes. They are very similar to Crocs as far as style, look and fit. The only issue is that the holes are larger than those on Crocs so many of the jibbets don’t fit."
4.0,"Love it, so cute. Material is a little thin so I'm afraid to wash it lol."
4.0,Me agrado el color
4.0,Bought for a friend of mine. She likes it.
4.0,Great wallet with plenty of space.  It is a bit bulkier than I would have liked but the leather will thin out with use.  I would absolutely buy this again.
4.0,"I haven't quite used them as of yet, but they look good on!  Will try next time I'm on the beach."
4.0,Work great for my watch. Slightly bigger than I thought but good product.
4.0,This is a great watch so far only had it for about 2 weeks only thing wrong is the pins for the band are so week I bent them in the first 2 days<br />Otherwise great watch
4.0,This item was exactly what I was looking for!! Extremely warm!
4.0,"Packaged well but coloring is a little different.  Inside rim of eyeglass is clear, not a flush smoke color so looks like maybe the glass is not fitting correctly.  Other than that will do to keep the sun out of my eyes."
4.0,They do not keep water out which is the main purpose of wearing goggles.<br /><br />I am changing my review because of their excellent customer service. They replaced the pair of goggles that were not working due to the side straps not locking like they were supposed to. The new paid works great so far. Keeps water out.
4.0,Works great and looks terrific! So glad I ordered them in 3 metals. 👍
4.0,"The fit was good, but they were pretty long. Since they,re lined it won’t matter, I can roll them or shorten them.  I usually wear a 6, just lost 75 lbs, but I ordered an 8, because I can’t believe I’m in a six, but also with cold Oregon winters I can wear thermals if I need to!"
4.0,The bra is very comfortable and cute but definitely not supportive for high impact workouts. I was searching for a sports bra I can run in being that I have a larger bust I need something supportive and the bra was not able to hold up to my standards. I'm going to definitely continue using is but it would be for a walk or weight training rather than cardio. It fits comfortably and looks exactly like the picture.
4.0,"Fits like a bikini top, the cup size is very small. I am a 38d. The band was good, cup size too small. Very sexy."
4.0,"These are difficult to figure out at first, way to long but can be cut.  Grandchildren love them and so does grandma, no more tie your shoelaces.  Like the colors."
4.0,"I bought this ring for my daughter, she loves it"
4.0,The blouse is lovely but I ordered XL size in this blouse and another from the same clothing manufacturer and those blouse was too small but the other fit perfectly. I don't know why in different styles the fit is off.
4.0,"So far, so good.  I haven't really spent much time in these shoes, so the only thing I can say is they do fit a little more snug than my other cycling shoes.  I would almost say by a half size."
4.0,"This piece would be fine if you are wearing a jacket or a sweater over it. Or if you don't care that it is almost entirely see-through. This top would definitely require a camisole, but personally, I am not comfortable in such a sheer piece, even with a camisole. I would want the additional cover of a sweater.<br /><br />It seems to be well made. The top washed up fine, and it fits well. It is very light weight. It is comfortable under a jacket or a sweater.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you are looking for a layering piece, this is a good choice. If you are looking for a top to wear on its own, consider how sheer it is, and judge by your own comfort level."
4.0,"Cute and comfortable house dress. I’m a 10/12, 36D chest and I got a large and it’s a little loose. Could have gone with a medium for a slimmer fit. Looks exactly like the photos."
4.0,Was a great gift for my niece!
4.0,perfect for my spetum and nose piercing but too short for my medusa
4.0,Love the movie and this shirt just makes me smile
4.0,So cute just heavy
4.0,Got this for my rehearsal dinner. Super cute and flattering but quite see through. Didn't check it out before flying out for the destination wedding so luckily I had another skirt to wear under it so everyone couldn't see my underwear.  Great dress but wear a slip!
4.0,"I love this wallet. Sits perfectly in the little pocket inside slacks pockets. The only issue I have had with it so far of about a month now, is that hotel key cards get erased by the magnet so that is something to keep in mind. If it affects those, I'm sure the credit cards would be in danger, but haven't used a card by strip in a while since I mainly use the chip or Google Pay."
4.0,cute & fun
4.0,"They actually don't have a lock feature and the swing gate does not have a pin at the free end which means that strength is minimal.  OTOH, they are very cheap to buy and work well for very light tasks."
4.0,Does not fit as expected size S is loose fitting  quality ok
4.0,Nice piece for my costume.
4.0,"These pants fit really nice. I'm between sizes 8 and 10 in pants and ordered a 10 in these and they fit well. I'm 5'8"" so sometimes regular length pants are a bit short on me but these are a good length. These are made of a nice stretchy fabric."
4.0,"These are cute but the arms feel a bit cheap,  i don't anticipate they will last more than a season.  But fit is great and style is cute and classic!"
4.0,"I like the shirt, but it runs small - and it's not as soft as others I've had."
4.0,Smaller than I expected but a nice piece overall
4.0,The strap on the smaller bags is falling off after just a couple of months of use. I really like the bag still though.
4.0,"Fit perfectly, however,  the actual color is not as vibrant as in the picture. More like light blue/Navy blue."
4.0,"Well, I like it! I wear Medium but ordered Large because people whote it runs small. Large fits me perfectly. Not bad material 👍🏻"
4.0,I would probably order a size larger but they're pretty cute and don't irritate my ears!
4.0,"Super cute, but size up 2 sizes. I’m a size medium and I ordered a large. The large is still a bit too tight."
4.0,It's a nice watch.
4.0,Very comfortable. Was hoping they'd be thicker material.
4.0,These r not a all day thing. They true green after a few hours. And so do ur nose.
4.0,Great product but a bit on the smaller side.
4.0,It was a good value for the money.
4.0,"The pattern was classy, however the cut and fit for my shape was not. The fabric felt a bit to heavy for the severely hit summers we have, however it was wrinkle free."
4.0,Fits as expected. Boughtbfor paintball works well for that purpose.
4.0,The swimsuit fit as expected.
4.0,The tabi socks are good quality. I wish the sandals were better quality but not bad. Definitely must wear the tabi with the sandals due to prickly of the grass.
4.0,The size was fine.  Arrived on time.  Happy with this purchase.
4.0,These work just fine.
4.0,"Very lightweight material.<br />It’s comfortable to wear, definitely have some space to breath, however will leave some mark(from pressure of your mask) if you wear it for awhile."
4.0,The fit is perfect 👌  great for the gym
4.0,A bit heavy but I love all the compartments
4.0,The necklace flowers were somewhat larger than I expected
4.0,"These Denim Crush Women's Studded Rhinestone jeans are cute and have plenty of stretch. The fit is a girlfriend style and the bottom/legs can be worn folded up or left down. The stretch is due to the fabric content which is 56% cotton, 26% polyester, 16% rayon, and 2% spandex.<br /><br />I reviewed Denim Crush size 8 jeans that had blossom embroidery. The two pair of jeans, though both size 8, differed greatly in fit. These Rhinestone jeans were much bigger in cut. The Rhinestone jeans size 8 swam on a 5'5&#34; tall, 135-140 woman with an hourglass shape but with a wider waist who usually wears size 6 to 8 pants. So there is extra room in these jeans, depending upon your body shape.<br /><br />I like the cut of the jeans and the look on the model, but these jeans are just big. Maybe quality control is the issue."
4.0,"The plastic part that holds the arm hinge onto the frame broke after a couple years. Really liked the shades, second pair and might even buy another since finding the original purchase receipt is unlikely (supposedly there's a lifetime warranty)."
4.0,Perfect after liposuction on axillary area &#34; batwing&#34; to use as for compression garment. I irdered small because of my arms being small but I had to buy a 5 hook bra extender so it will fit under my breasts. So it works for me and ordered 2 more. Live it!!!
4.0,Sound could be better
4.0,"I love this sweater.  It is not thin.  It is very form fitting.  I have a fatty tummy that Im working on slimming before the cold weather arrives, or it will be seen (bulge).  I am 5'2&#34; and approx 134 lbs currently.  My bust is a 34b.  I ordered the medium and it fits comfortably.  Very happy with this purchase and this designer.  I have purchased 3 other tops and am equally happy with them."
4.0,"I had originally ordered an XL, (I wear a 12/14 dress).  It was a little too big, which made it look sloppy.  I reordered a large.  It fits well, maybe a tad snug, but because of style it looks fine.  Nice fabric, not a thin see through material.  Pockets are good, don't stick out.  I'm 5'5"" and this hits just below my knees.  So a good length for me.<br />Overall a good purchase and price.  Would buy again."
4.0,"This shirt is very pretty and lightweight. It arrived quickly and is in good condition, but the sizes run a bit small so order up one if you want it to be flowing like the picture shows. I bought an xl, wear about a 10, and it fits perfectly, but not loosely."
4.0,Random statement rings are awesome
4.0,"Looks beautiful on, my daughter looked like a princess! Size as expected, only thing was the fabric is a bit cheap, but its good for the price!"
4.0,"A little larger than I thought, but they are really pretty and I will enjoy wearing them."
4.0,I love this necklace & the only reason I gave it a 4/5 is because it comes on a very cheap chain which I will replace-  For the money that I spent; I feel that it should come on a better chain and I shouldn’t have to purchase another chain.
4.0,Very attractive fitted shirt. Received much sooner than expected. Fits nicely and comfortable stretch material.
4.0,They sit a little weird on the face.  They're cute but seem too high on the face!
4.0,"It's a little tight around the shoulders and the zipper is cheap, but I got a ton of compliments in it! Ordered a size up, rest of it fit great. Shoulders were just a bit tight. It does have a full back zipper, so don't purchase it if you hate or can't zip one."
4.0,"Shipped fast . Is a nice sweater . Fit as expected but haven't washed it yet , only worn twice, hopefully it doesn't shrink."
4.0,Its a beautiful top but it does come very wrinkled. It is also a VERY short crop top and looks longer in the photos. Super cute though just disappointed in the length.
4.0,"I really like this blouse, but it does run really large. I'm 5'5, and have a very large bust 38 DDD, and I weigh 175, and I normally wear a XL, and sometimes 2xl, but I'm sure glad I listened to other reviews and went smaller than I'd normally order, I bought a Large and it's almost too big, but roomy enough to have plenty of room for my waist and breasts. I'm glad I went with a large. You must order at least a size smaller or even 2 sizes smaller than you'd normally wear. I do really like the shirt. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it runs so large."
4.0,Shirt sleeves slightly 1/4 inch longer.  i could live with  everything else was fine but the shipping cost more than the items  crazy
4.0,See above. Would probably buy again
4.0,"I got a small and it was still kinda baggy, definitwlynnit the material I was expecting but overall still super cute!!"
4.0,"The sweater was just a little big, otherwise very nice outfit."
4.0,The hat was almost perfect.  Grandson wished it had traditional bottom snap adjustment instead of Velcro.  Velcro sticks to his hair.
4.0,"This is a very comfortable top made from a soft, smooth fabric (not t-shirt material).  I really like it, but it runs large.  I wear a large to extra large and ordered an extra large.  But it seems significantly larger than most extra larges and the style makes it seem even larger.  It is very long, too, and probably best if worn like a tunic.  I ordered this in Ombre Ink Green, but it is blue.  A very pretty blue, but definitely blue.  I gave this a high rating because it is a nice top and I'll keep it.  Just know that it is large and roomy and not green."
4.0,"I bought this sweater in 2 different colors, the wine and the black, both size XL.  The black one fits better.... not as tight on the chest.  I'm on the fence about whether or not to keep the red; I wish it came one size larger!  I will say that the color and the fabric is beautiful.  It's a very well made sweater."
4.0,Got these for a witch project for the outdoors works good for what I needed it was a bit small but definitely workable
4.0,This scarf is definitely interesting.  Took us a bit to figure out how to get it looking good and the material is extremely light until you bunch it up- like a shredded t-shirt.
4.0,The battery life is was great at first.... it’s health didn’t last as long I would like... however overall... it’s an amazing product! 4.6 out of 5.00
4.0,"semi see through but very deep neck line, decent material, def need to iron"
4.0,Cute shirts but ran small. They are a bit tight but I make do.
4.0,These gloves work well in snow. Only used them a few times but kept hands warm and dry so far. Works well with touch screen. A little bulky for this. Don't imagine I'll be texting while shoveling though. I received ozero leather work gloves as gift and liked them so bought these. Both fit well and seem durable. We'll see how long they last.
4.0,"They run a little big, but are super cute and great quality!"
4.0,"Nice kids soccer shoes, they feel a little bit simple material wise"
4.0,Chain was perfect length for my 3 1/2 niece . The pendant is very large. A little too large for a little girl but she loves it .
4.0,Love the quality was a little bigger than I thought but my son loves it
4.0,Was a gift.  Fit perfectly.
4.0,"I bought this hoping it would be pretty comfortable and lay well on me, but it didn't. It was a little bit too thin for my preference and I ended up getting rid of it about 6-9 months after buying it due to it. It isn't soft either as the fabric was not scratchy but not soft either. It is okay, I would recommend for a last minute type thing, or needing something cheap, but not long term or anything. I liked it when I had it."
4.0,"These were as describe but I don’t think I realized how big that meant. They were a little bigger and the “threads” of the know were a little thicker than I had anticipated, so I returned, but they did appear to be good quality."
4.0,Comfortable and can be worn with just about anything.
4.0,Cute fit and surprisingly nice fabric.  Will be great summer and vacation dress.  Ordered small (5'4&#34; at 120 lbs)
4.0,"Great for rain. Not so great for warmth. Although it is fleece lined, it doesn't retain the body heat very well."
4.0,a bit too bulky on the waist but my daughter likes it
4.0,"Fits well, the pants were a little big. They pants are a great quality and a soft denim. The suspenders are detachable which is nice. The shirt is cute but the puppy is screen printed and not a stitched on patch. That's the only reason it gets 4 starts. It doesnt look bad but not the same as what's pictured."
4.0,"The blouse drapes very nicely, and I love the color.  I did not realize the 3/4 sleeve was the type that you roll up and button; I don't like this type because it never really looks right to me when I do it.  That's not really a deal breaker for me because the color is gorgeous. The product description describes the color as rose, it looks more like fuchsia to me and did I say...I LOVE THE COLOR!"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:40fbdd86f42f5d58e113b6b60b297481]] Straight forward<br />Strap has a nice thickness, looks good on the watch But it has a lot play on the springs, I wish it had the some cylinders so the spring bars won’t move that much. Watch guys know that if used every day it will eventually be ruined soon a be just a $30 waste. At this point idk if should just returned or just keep it since it’s been used for a week now."
4.0,"My nephew is 5 and wanted some slippers to wear around the house. He loves dinosaurs and the design on them wasn't too ""childish"" for him. They fit perfectly as well! I would highly recommend."
4.0,"Perfect fit. Material is thinner then expected, needs a tank underneath."
4.0,Cute top. A tad loose but a strapless bra works well with it.
4.0,"Lots of smaller gauged jewelry (18, 20 gauge), but for the price it's an immensely good deal! It's pretty easy to strip the closure balls, but otherwise it's about the same quality that sells for a couple bucks a piece of jewelry. I would definitely recommend this if you have quite a few piercings, are looking into getting numerous piercings, or if you consistently damage/lose your pieces."
4.0,"Need to order 1 size up. I am a size 8, which is a small in American sizes. I ordered medium to allow for curves but not too tight."
4.0,I added a silver cross charm to this and I wear it everyday.
4.0,It's got a good grip on it. Makes it easier to get in and take off. I like it better than my leather strap.
4.0,"I got this belt for my husband.  I was completely impressed.  It came in the nicest box!  When you open the box, there was a nice bag that you opened to find a belt.  I didn't intend on this being a gift, my husband just needed a belt.  But after opening it, I handed it to him more so as a present.  He was pretty impressed too.  The packaging really sets everything off.  It would make a great Christmas present, and would be great to gift coworkers."
4.0,"Quality seems good.  Bought it for my pre-teen son and he loves it.  The size is a bit on a smaller side, so I would definitely size up.  My son usually wears an X-Large in boys, or small in men’s, and I got a medium which fits him perfectly."
4.0,"Lovely, but needs a little more size."
4.0,"Thought it was larger, however it is absolutely gorgeous! Quality is great! Color mates my mules exactly!"
4.0,Ok! Have to put a tank top underneath
4.0,"Nice, good material quality"
4.0,"Fits perfect, I like it and my girlfriend loves the look. Based on the construction I think it will last."
4.0,"Love this hat! It does fit a little larger than I expected, but it’s perfect for my Halloween scarycrow outfit 😁"
4.0,I like the look and feel of the jacket but it was a bit on the snug side.
4.0,"I love these leggings. They keep their shape &amp; wear really well.  The only problem I've found is accurate sizing on the garment. I bought a size small, but clearly was an XS. I bought another pair, size small, but this time they were clearly a medium."
4.0,Great hat! Looks awesome in person!
4.0,"This dress is beautiful but it runs small through bust. I am a 38C and a 16 was way too tight, like can't breathe, too tight. I had to send it back"
4.0,"Nice, soft sweater and gorgeous plum color. Haven’t worn or washed it yet to see how it will hold up. The sizing is a little off. I’m 5’2” and 114lbs and ordered the recommended small. It’s huge. Will keep it anyway for layering."
4.0,They're nice and lightweight. Really good quality 👍
4.0,"Socks are great and comfy, the size was perfect. The material was somewhat thin, perfect for summer. As a zombie fan I enjoy wearing them."
4.0,"*The design is lovely, but the stitching on the sleeves were irritating the underside of my arms till the point they got red. I glued on some felt along the stitching from the inside of the sleeves and now it’s better.<br />*The material isn’t very breathable so I only wear it on cold days."
4.0,Good product. Fits my use.
4.0,They are just like the picture and fit perfect.
4.0,They were small and the chain was to thin.
4.0,It's beautifully ornate and much larger than I expected.  The colors are exactly as pictured and the copper trim highlights the pink stone wonderfully. It is a bit heavy though.
4.0,Cups in the bra are a bit weird but overall a good buy.
4.0,"It fits great, it just wish it went up higher on the back so that all my back fat was covered. However its great quality, and doesn't hurt at all."
4.0,"These are good synthetic shirts.  Flat seams/stitching, few loose threads, reasonably well made.<br /><br />Size down if you want something form fitting.  True to size if you want something loose and comfortable."
4.0,I bought these for my 13 month old daughter and they have held up well.  They fit her foot comfortably and she can walk in them without difficulty.  I would recommend them for new walkers as a first shoe.
4.0,I used the mini cowboy hat on my dog for Halloween!!!  It was a third of the price that some places want for dog outfits. I would very much recommend this mini cowboy hat.
4.0,I like this case! I regularly had a hard time finding my other case so I wanted one with bright colors do I could find it easily! This did the trick. Also feels sturdy and will protect my glasses. Thanks!!
4.0,Nice jersey a bit way too long.
4.0,I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear this necklace.
4.0,"Thin, but not sheer."
4.0,"Good item, nice look on my gear watch!"
4.0,I have not used this yet.  I purchased Italian Charms and Bracelets for my daughters and I could not figure out how to put them all together.  I will update when I have the time to try to construct the bracelets.
4.0,"worked well for hiking and traveling, comfy and great gripping on the bottom, recommend purchase"
4.0,"These are similar to the Gymshark Vital Seamless Leggings, but not quite the same.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The fabric is soft and stretchy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's more sheer than the Gymshark leggings and the material is not as smooth as the real thing (which is more of a personal preference).<br /><br />I am a size small in Gymshark (5'2"" and 110 lbs) and bought a size small in these as well. It fits great and is a full length on my petite frame. Overall, it's a good purchase for the price and I'd stick to the dark colors if you are worried about it being see-through."
4.0,Absolutely love these. They fit my ear perfectly. Also love that the cuff part can be removed and you can wear a plain stud.
4.0,the friction fit onto the sunglasses is way too tight.  this needs to be more elastic to accommodate different sunglass sizes.
4.0,"Bought these for my daughter who is 5'2"", 125 lbs. curvy build.  I got the small.  Pants are a nice soft, medium weight, cotton material and cute style.  I do think they run slightly small depending on your build.  I am 5' 6"" 127 lbs., lean, athletic build. They fit me pretty well."
4.0,"This is such a cute top!  I usually wear a small but ordered a med due to the reviews.  It fits great, it's not a very long top but looks great with high waisted bottoms.  The green leaf print is sbout 4 inches shorter than the blk and white stripe but still great! Highly recommend them."
4.0,"Very nice pictures and low price but the chains are very poor quality. Chain broke in one day but it's ok for this low price, we'll keep the pendant and reading pace the chain"
4.0,Nice sunglasses but when I received them they were bent to hell. Took me a while to finally get them some-what straight
4.0,Runs a bit smaller than expected but it is cute and a nice shirt to wear with jeans. I like the material and other than it fitting a little close it's pretty comfortable.
4.0,Good quality but a lot pinker than in the picture.
4.0,"Great bag, but strap is short. With it fully expanded it barely fit across my chest."
4.0,"A little large for a small, but otherwise good for cool spring days"
4.0,"I like this dress and my husband really likes it.  I read the reviews and customer feedback and decided to take a chance on ordering the small.  I'm 5'2&#34; and 130 lbs.  But I'm a 34D in the bust, so there is a slight pull on the bust button (even though it's covered -- it's trying to peek out).  If you look on the size guide, you can see I was risking it with the small because I'm right on the S/M threshold.  So, I will order the medium and see if there is a difference.  I'm hoping it won't be too big.  I should have gone with my first instinct and ordered up.  I'm a busty petite, so oddly-sized.  However, I love the high belt -- perfect for petites/those who don't have long torsos.  Love the style, will keep my fingers crossed for the medium.  Update:  the medium is excellent - no pulling!"
4.0,Used the sizing measurements in the add and the description of the model who is the same size as my daughter and bought a small. Had to send it back for a large. The waist is the same size on all its just the length that is different. The large fits well but there is no way the model is the size they claim and wearing a small.
4.0,Swim suit is nice color was exactly like the picture and it fit nice.
4.0,"This key chain is so cute! It almost looks real. Very good quality, I would recommend it."
4.0,"I love it, but it was smaller than I expected."
4.0,The bottom fits well but my top is too small. Is there anyway I can send the top back for a one size larger? The bottoms fit perfect.
4.0,This necklace is very pretty. I love the way the diamond hangs there inside very pretty. Would make a very nice gift.
4.0,"Not terrible. As others have said they can feel a little scratchy. I used the size guide off their website, and ordered extra large based on that, should've just bought large. I haven't really used them enough to say much about them, it has to be pretty cold before I put gloves on."
4.0,"These are cute....What can I say, They are thin and delicate, But I like them."
4.0,Very nice charm. It seems to be authentic.
4.0,pretty but a bit heavy for my ears. Seems to be well made.
4.0,Great right from the package. Perfect fit from nose clip to under chin.  They have full coverage and don’t move but aren’t confining.
4.0,"Love the colors, Wear a cami underneath.  Very comfortable."
4.0,"I was looking for a nice dress for a summer beach wedding, and this dress will be perfect. The material wasn't what I expected, it is almost like bathing suit material, but it will travel well and hangs very nicely. The Aqua color is beautiful, adding a little lace shrug and some white sandals and done!"
4.0,Great shirt but a little small for a XXL
4.0,cute little keychain.  Makes me smile when I see it.  Don't expect it to last forever but that's ok
4.0,I am a 34A and ordered a medium. They are a bit snug so I probably would have returned them and gone up to a large but I've kept them. They relax a bit once you have them on. Material is nice.
4.0,"Too big and looses, Golfing."
4.0,Scarves add interest to more reserved clothing.  This one can be used in a variety of ways because of its coloration and length.
4.0,"This cover is sturdy, nice looking and protects my tablet. The only downside is that it doesn't stay up which can be pretty frustrating. I had to put Velcro strips on it in two places to keep tablet up when viewing in landscape mode."
4.0,I love them!!  they are comfortable and the pants don't leave sweat marks!!
4.0,"It's a good product but it was a bit large on me, I ordered a Small but it fits as it if it was a Medium.  They should add an XSmall."
4.0,It took me awhile to figure out how to wear this dress but once I got it I fell in love and received so many compliments
4.0,"At first I was disappointed because I couldn't get these to stay on my ear, but soon realized they are flexible. I have bent them to fit my ears, and love them. Super cute crawler earrings... goes great with my pixie cut."
4.0,This was super cute.  It looked exactly like the picture.  She loved it!
4.0,"Everything the others said is accurate. Tricky so best to be creative. Smaller woman won't be able to use as instructed because the ""arms"" and the scarf itself are pretty long.  Still cute, so I'm happy."
4.0,"Very good purse for those lighter load days.  The main compartment holds my big eyeglass case, small wallet, small hand lotion, and keys.  Two different outside pockets are large enough for my smartphone, though the one in flap is awkward.  Finding a good use for that one is why I went 4 stars.  I could probably fit the phone in the main compartment if I unzipped the expander, but it takes away from the otherwise good, sporty look of the purse.  I'm pleased with the purchase."
4.0,"Like the dress; however, it fits a little snug around my midsection. Still a nice dress and I love the material."
4.0,"Tinier than expected, but pretty nonetheless"
4.0,The dress is super cute but it's a bit short I'm 5'5 goes above the knees. I have to wear shorts under because &#34;little kids&#34;. I bought size large as I'm a size 12-14.
4.0,"This coat is very large, I ordered a medium, I should have purchased the small (I’m 5’ 4” 130 lbs.)."
4.0,Teacher gifts
4.0,"The pendant butterfly part of the necklace is nice but the neck chain that comes with it isn't nearly as nice, it is rather dull looking. I am disappointed."
4.0,Fine and functional.  I like that it's elastic but the negative of that is when I undo the belt it pops back through the loops that it came through.
4.0,+Great Socks! Do not slip off my heel and I always wear no-shows for the most part.<br /><br />#LMHO
4.0,good vision during cloudy days.  fit well .  For the money a good alternative to oakley lens cost.
4.0,Fits great.  Good quality.
4.0,"This is one of the most comfortable bras I've owned in a long time. I typically buy Aerie bras, but being 25 I thought I should graduate to a more mature line of bras. Buying Spanx in the past for shapewear I trusted the name and picked up the black racerback from my local Gabes for $10.00. I always gain and lose weight in my bust first and after gaining 10 pounds I went up a bra size to a 34 D. I didn't get a chance to try this bra on at the store and they only had a 36 D, so took a chance and bought it. When I tried it on at home it fit like a glove. I can see why people would say this bra runs small and I would assume it runs about one band size small."
4.0,Works great. Great show piece for all of my foreign money
4.0,"Easy to install and looks good...gets dirty easy, but it does clean up"
4.0,I enjoyed my purchase though it wasn't really set up to use on either hand or it would cut off the circulation in my right hand and fingers. Other than that I give this product 4.5 stars for  performance!
4.0,"The look of the top is great, although the stitching is a bit restrictive in the bodice.  I would have liked the stiching to have as much flexability as the fabrics themselves.  Overall however, I am very pleased with this purchase."
4.0,I haven't wore it yet but like it...
4.0,Good...but material runs on thinner side.  Lunch bag a good size
4.0,"I love the Bohemian flavor of this bracelet....would have given it 5 stars because I  thought it was wider on the wrist. Over all very nice, wish there were matching necklace."
4.0,Love love love these leggings. For the price you can't beat them. They are comfy and fit perfectly.
4.0,Still love it very Fancy
4.0,"Got it for my daughter. Fits nicely. Only complaint is that it is REALLY long: she's average height, can pull it up to her armpits like an odd dress and the bottom hem will be at her ankles. For now, until we can find a better solution (we don't have a sewing machine, so that's not one), she rolls it at the waist but if you are wearing this for several hours a day like to school or work, you'll be having to constantly reroll it. Otherwise, she does really like it and because the variety of colors, it will go with almost any tshirt she has so she can wear it to school on days she doesn't feel like wearing pants."
4.0,Very cute purse. Big enough to fit a thin wallet and some other things. The only bad thing is the inside pocket doesn't zip correctly and gets stuck alot.
4.0,"Is thin enough to wear under tight motorcycle jacket.  Doesn’t seem as warm as I expected. But only used a couple of times, so maybe still a learning curve on my side."
4.0,They are a bit hard to get on.
4.0,"They look nice but a bit big for me in the crutch and length. I have to wear high heels and the crutch seems lower down than it’s supposed to be.<br /><br />If I fold the waist band it brings the whole thing up and I’m able to use them with flat sandals. This solution limits the kind of tops to use. I’m thinking on taking it to a tailor to get it fit properly.<br /><br />So if you’re not petite and thin like me these pants will look good. I ordered my regular size XS and I’m 5’1”, 105lbs, pants 25-26.<br /><br />FYI it comes with interior shorts in a Lycra like fabric, hope is not hot."
4.0,I like them and they look good!!
4.0,Love the variation of colors. I like more bling. These are pretty neutral.
4.0,"While the dress looks quite nice on the model, it was less so on me. But one can't fault the dress on that. Seemed well made. Color was gorgeous. Return was simple."
4.0,"I really like this suit!<br />The suit is fully lined so it’s not see through.<br />The print is like a leopard and a tiger - my husband thinks it’s a little wild. I really like it.<br />I normally wear a medium - this suit in a medium is too small - seams were ripping when I tried it on!<br />I think this suit is super cute!<br />I prefer this suit with the removable cups removed - they slide all over and don’t sit where they should.<br />The shoulder strap was a little uncomfortable but I blame that on the sizing, not on the style.<br />For reference I’m 5’5” 143ish lbs and 34D."
4.0,"Great sports bra! The cups can shift around a little, but are easy to get back in place and stay in place while I'm wearing it."
4.0,I wear this vest under my work out sweats I bought it to help loose belly fat and it really helps. Makes you sweat heavier in the upper body area
4.0,This dress is soft and very comfortable. It definitely seems to run large because I ordered a smaller size than usual and it's still pretty loose.
4.0,Muy buen calidad. Las tiras son muy largas
4.0,"Liked this a lot!  Definitely, need nude undergarments under it.  Bought a large but really could have used a medium(out of stock and hasn't come back in stock, too late to exchange anyways)."
4.0,"Very cute socks for Easter and Spring season! Thin & more novelty than for warmth & function. Definitely for ladies, ordered for my nephews but are too small & femine for guys! Fun to give to girlfriends."
4.0,Nice Sterling  hoops with sparkle.  Nice size not awful big
4.0,Could do with a larger size
4.0,"Very nice jewelry. Don't get it too wet, too often; it loosens the leather. Otherwise I've worn it since the day I bought it."
4.0,"Nice soft material but fits a little snug, I don’t consider myself having a large head either."
4.0,I like it but my husband did not. He also has asthma and DOES NOT like the masks or anything to do with them He also has a big head 🤣
4.0,"Perhaps not for those who have finger dexterity problems. The clasp is very hard to open. This is why I returned it. Good product overall. Once the clasp is closed it is secure. The feel was great. I didn't test the waterproofing by showering or sweating in the gym. The necklace seemed sturdy when I tugged on the cord a few times and added my charms that weigh an ounce. I didn't test this fully by wearing it 24/7 through working, sleeping, gym sessions and showering. I would buy this as a gift for those without dexterity issues."
4.0,Very nice print material is thin great for summer however white dress is see through so need to wear a slip underneath also rubs a little big will wash and dry for a more snug fit but overall great dress can’t wait for my sons baptism to wesr
4.0,Nice dress but had to have it tailored to fit. Bought a size small. Received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"I got my neckace today! It’s quite small, smaller than it looks in the pictures—its about the length of the first section of an index finger and half that size in width. At any rate looking forward to using it for throat chakra work."
4.0,Great material and the shirt fits nicely. The back is a little long but would go great with pants or tucked in
4.0,"Very light-weight, which is not exactly what I expected. However, I got to use it in a rainstorm and the water just beaded and rolled off of it. Planning on using on a fishing trip to Alaska. Hope it holds up...Love the color."
4.0,"Wasn't really red, but I like the sweater. Nice comfortable fit."
4.0,"Great boots for my daughter, sturdy and very warm for winter. They clean up pretty well too."
4.0,It was a &#34;little&#34; larger than I expected.
4.0,Disappointed that you can hardly read the writing.
4.0,"Really nice, maybe a little thicker than expected, but I like it.  Good quality!"
4.0,"I wouldn't trust these to hold any weight, however they are very unique and look really nice. Shipping was quick!"
4.0,"This is a good quality shirt. But it does run one size too big. I normally take a 1Xl-2Xl size shirt, I ordered this shirt a 2Xl size and it’s really quite baggy and long on me. I usually like my shirts a little baggy, but this was baggier than I like"
4.0,I love these earrings only thing I wish is that they were made of some type of color or enamel. I didn't realize that they were made of all wood. But any Lauren hill fan can definitely tell what they are and love them.
4.0,They worked without being too tight. Took a long time to ship from china
4.0,"Big fan of these leggings, so is my daughter. They are super soft, like Lula Roe leggings but 1/3 the cost."
4.0,"I ride my bike quite a bit. I usually wear bibs, particularly for longer rides, but often I just want something less &#34;racey&#34; for long days on my mountain bike. I bought some nice mtb shorts on clearance, but then got home and realized they didn't come with a liner. So I tried these. So far, I've ridden in the 4 times. One of the rides was about 5.5 hours, 50 miles, and I used chamois butter. One of the rides was a little over 3 hours, almost 30 miles. On that one, I did not use chamois butter. Both of those rides had tons of climbing (the first one 7500 feet, the second 4,500 feet). With chamois butter, I had no problems on the long ride. Without it, I did get a bit of chaffing on the 3 hour ride. But overall, these are pretty good for the cost. I would think for a spin class or something less intense than multiple hours in the saddle on technical terrain, these would be MORE than enough. I haven't tried these for a road bike, but for that I'll likely just stick to my regular lycra shorts. The fit is pretty perfect - I have always worn a medium, and the medium in these fit perfect. I'm shy of 5'10&#34;, 140 pounds. Normally, I'm a bit sick of all female biking gear being pink, but I kind of like the bring pink chamois!"
4.0,Beautiful jacket.  Comfy
4.0,"My husband  has lymphoma, it was hard to find a shoe to fit his feet,I purchased  a size larger and it fits well, very happy  with this item"
4.0,Very comfortable I am 5’8 and it hit right at my feet so that was a win. Really love the dress
4.0,for the price it was worth it!!
4.0,Nice fit. Nice swimsuit
4.0,[[VIDEOID:7e19659ae83d27ab03a1b465ed655504]] Fist it looks like a kids toy. And yall put a note handed to resedent.  Was layer next to my door. No one handed me anything.  )
4.0,"it's very soft and more high quality than I Imagined! zipper seems a bit cheep but it holds together :) I can tell it's gonna be really nice and warm n cuddly. the only bad thing about it is that when I washed it the first time, the black dye in it turned the white hood a light blue /purple color, but I don't mind so much. I do suggest washing it by itself the first time. Also! get a size or two larger than you think you are, so it's nice and roomy. overall i love it and I'm glad I bought it"
4.0,grand daughter loved...  good thing she has a january birthday...  missed the xmas window!
4.0,"I purchased this 5 months ago and I have really loved it until recently. The clips on the back of the unit have broken off. I only use the light early in the morning to walk my dog so it doesn't get any ""rough usage."" I couldn't locate a number to customer service so hopefully they will see this and reach out to see if a replacement can be sent. Will update later<br /><br />UPDATE: The vendor fixed the issue and I'm up and running again. This is a great little light for early morning walks."
4.0,Very cute but a little plain. I added beads to the ties for sn extra zip!
4.0,Love the look but the part that goes into your nose came with sharp spit's on it but they came off with a file
4.0,"It's very cute!  All things are just about as expected, including colors and such.  I gave 4 stars because the ponytail part was a bit too heavy.  As long as it was wrapped with plastic, all hairs would okay.  but once that is removed (which my daughter did), hair everywhere!  but again, I can't expect any kids to use this hat gently, so overall, I'm happy with this item."
4.0,"Got a medium size, I am on the petite size so I had to cut off the bottom of the dress.  Very comfortable, I should have got a small.  Very roomy and has pockets. Bonus!"
4.0,"Excelente sudadera, muy cálida y confortable, pero la talla es muy justa. A un amigo le gustó y el fue el que se la quedó. Cuatro estrellas por que si varía ligeramente el color con el desplegado en la imagen."
4.0,"First, the seller did respond to me that this jacket was VERY small in size compared to US standards after I emailed them with my concerns.  I had already purchased so decided to just receive the jacket and give it to someone else.  Well, this jacket is VERY small.  It seems well made and looks nice.  Just know that the largest size, XXXL, is probably a US XL at best.  The description does say these are Asian sizes so if you don't get the right size, the seller does clearly warn.<br /><br />The jacket seems well made and the fabric is nice.  The only thing I really don't like is that on the front and back the word 'KELME' is printed in large letters.  It is a bit strange and I would have preferred this not to be on the jacket.  This is a nice jacket for fall and spring time.  It is lightweight and will keep you warm."
4.0,"I love 90' yoga pants... Actually have a few. Ordered these thinking they would be the same, they were &#34;ok&#34;... They were a little tighter then I was hoping for. When I looked at the label after purchasing its different then last years blend. I did wear them the other day and they were comfortable."
4.0,I just got finished taking this carry on underseater on a trip to Florida. It worked great! It fit under the seat on a Delta flight with no problems. I was in the middle seat for three of my flights and a window seat on the last one. I fit more clothes in there than I thought I would be able to. It worked well. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the zippers don't always slide smoothly. But for the convenience of not having a lift a suitcase to the over head bins made my trip so much easier.
4.0,OMG how cute!  I purchased the blue pair of shoes for my son and they are adorable.  They make every outfit!  They fit just as expected.  Bend easily when walking.  Great quality.  Easy to place on foot.  Would definitely buy again as he grows older.
4.0,Good quality hooded sweatshirt honoring one of my daughter's favorite Disney stars.  She just had to have it.  ;)
4.0,"Very lightweight, but beautiful none the less."
4.0,"I didn't expect a lot for the money, Better than I expected."
4.0,This was a birthday gift to my sister. We don't live in the same state but when I chatted with her on the phone she seemed pleased with her gift.
4.0,Super nice and soft fabric.  The only down side was that they rolled down my babies legs.
4.0,These are super cute bracelets the only complaint.... the chain to connect it on.. is super cheap. nice clasp but cheap gumball chain.. For the price its a good buy just don't pull on it to hard or get it caught on anything.. better yet have a friend put it on for you... lol
4.0,It was a little large but I am tired of shopping for suits.  It is quite pretty and flattering and has adequate coverage on the backside.  I will keep the suit and maybe buy a smaller size next time.
4.0,"I’ve been using these for my masks for a couple months now. They work really well, and are pretty versatile with my outfits. The only negative is that my favorite color, which was the multicolored on, broke only a few weeks in."
4.0,Fit as expected.  Looks great.  Takes a long time to receive.
4.0,works well with blue magic
4.0,"The delivery was fast, the packaging is great, a good instruction manual is included, the watch looks good and the band appears sturdy. The drawback is that it took awhile to figure out how to set the time - I would have had even more difficulty without the manual illustrations."
4.0,"These are nice, sturdy wings and halo.  The feathers are good quality on the wings and they fit comfortably on my very small 9 yo daughter.  The halo is cute and sparkly too."
4.0,"Really like the magnetic clasp, only thing I don’t enjoy is that the side of the band catches on clothing materials."
4.0,"Liked the fabric, however XL was the largest size available and it did not fit.  I wear a size 16 pants and thought an XL would be ok, but it was too small around the butt."
4.0,Cute but wayyyyyyyyy top big for me. I'm  140 lb small waist hips and butt and the S was still too big. Will be returning... wish they had it in XS or even XXS .... A small will fit someone one over 170 lb and look sexy... I'll  give it a 4 star for cuteness
4.0,Fits great after wearing it with a black dress after a couple hours start to see the back of the belt stained black other then that fits great
4.0,Awsome im 5&#34;10 175lb ordered a medium its mid thigh length great quality id order again 😍
4.0,"nice looking, warm runs a little small"
4.0,"I needed a dress that has easy access to nursing the baby. This dress is 10% linen and 90% cotton making it an on-trend piece that is great for the summer. My post partum weight is 115-120 lb and 34B-34D and the SMALL fits well. NOTE that there is no elasticity to the material so the fit can be tricky. The chest and waist band just fit me, so are the arms. In short,<br />Pros:<br />Good for nursing<br />Breathable material<br />Material is lined waist down<br />Hides postpartum pooch<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fit is less forgiving on the torso<br />Material is wrinkly<br />Risk of ripping due to thin material"
4.0,"I had a pair of faux leather cowboy boots I loved, but the vinyl started to peel, so I had to toss them. I wanted another pair of black boots to wear with my western skirts, jeans and shirts in the fall and winter, but I couldn’t afford to even LOOK at real leather ones, because they are SO expensive! I also don’t like glitz and glam on my footwear, so that eliminated quite a few other options.<br /><br />These boots are unique in the sense that they are made of polyester fabric with a foam lining. That gives the decorative stitching a quilted look, and it makes these very lightweight. They don’t have a lot of padding and zero arch support; nevertheless, they are not uncomfortable. They do make my feet sweat, but so did my vinyl ones. I ordered my usual size, and they fit great. The toe is more tapered than my old blunt-nosed pair, but they didn’t cramp my toes like most pointed shoes do. The one inch heel is just right, adding some height without sending me into a nose dive to the floor. The sides are a bit floppy, but they don't sag when I wear them.<br /><br />I must say that these are only cowboy boots in the fashion sense. They are not sturdy enough to stand up to real horse-riding, roping or other activities. But if you are looking for a Western look that’s reasonably priced and fairly comfortable, this is a decent choice. These aren’t currently available, so I don’t know what they’ll be going for, but I’d say anything in the $20-40 range is reasonable for these low-budget boots."
4.0,I am a size 10 and I like how it looks on me!
4.0,very cute and sexy.... love them with skinny jeans...size runs a little  big though...
4.0,"Good quality, but the large fits more like and X-large.  Hope it shrinks some in the wash.<br />Vie G"
4.0,love the boots but they are really tight
4.0,Be careful because it will scratch easy but it is easy to use it is the true measurements
4.0,"I love this band! It's heavy duty, the buckle they used makes it easy to take on/off and I've actually used the little multi-tool thing a couple times. The compass? Silly. And the whistle? Doesn't seem to work. But I don't care about those. I had an almost identical band to this that got lost a while back and I've found that it's hard to find paracord bands that use this type of buckle. I've now ordered an extra just in case something happens to the first.<br /><br />I took off one star for one reason...the band is not adjustable. My original band had a sort of thin velcro piece at one end that allowed you to make small adjustments in the length...this one doesn't have that and I wish it did so that I could fine-tune the length. But even without that, it fits my wrist pretty well so I'm happy."
4.0,They are comfortable and do the job just not very stylish looking
4.0,"Gorgeous top, but runs large. I’m 5’10” 170lbs with a 36D and the large was too big. Also it’s more of a long tunic."
4.0,"Nice dress and fit, material a little thinner than expected but still cute."
4.0,Nice quality shirt. I got a medium but wished I would have tried a large. The medium fits ok but I could use a tad bit more room in the hip area. It’s really cute. I’ll be ordering more colors soon!
4.0,Seems nice. And comfy
4.0,"Woolly's Women's Merino Pro-Knit Wool Cropped Pullover Hoodie is my third Woolly purchase. I was a little apprehensive about ordering it because of its length. It looks short on the model in the listing's photographs.<br /><br />When my hoodie arrived and I had tried it on, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not as short on me as I had thought it was going to be.<br /><br />There are no pockets in this hoodie which is a slight downer. I find myself reaching for them a lot which is something I do often when I wear hoodies. The sleeves are a bit long for me as well. Lack of pockets and long sleeves aside, this is a super cute top!<br /><br />When contemplating this purchase, I was unable to locate the manufacturer’s measurement chart in the listing so I chose a size XXL. I’m glad I did. I like the fit a lot.<br /><br />I should note that I do have sensitive skin and typically cannot wear wool without it bothering me. This top is slightly itchy but so far, I’m able to wear it without feeling uncomfortable. I should note, I have yet to put it through the wash and dryer.<br /><br />For sizing reference:<br />My Bust measures 42"", My Waist Measures 38"", and my Hips Measure 48"". I am 5’5” tall. I ordered the XXL."
4.0,"It was very form fitting, soft, but had some tightness around the ankles."
4.0,So far it’s very good.  The side pockets are a little useless but the rest is great. I would rather have a couple of molle straps so I could customize it myself.  Fits my 10x50 vortex binos perfectly.
4.0,"I received this bracelet for an honest review on the product. I came quickly with the 2 day prime.  It was in a beautiful pouch wrapped in bubble wrap.  It was in perfect condition.  The bracelet is really pretty whether it works on pain or not.  I really enjoy wearing it just for the feel and look.  I'm not really sure that it has decreased my joint pain in my wrists and thumbs though. I haven't worn it consistently long enough to really tell if it might help in the long run.  The older I get the less time I like to wear any jewelry. Also, I've just read some other reviews and maybe I haven't put it on tight enough as I've gotten no sensations from it at all. I will try that and add to this if it seems to be working better.  Love the bracelet but not so sure about the Therapy part."
4.0,"I got this shirt for my daughter to wear to Pride this year. It feels soft, fits her well, and she loved it. When she went to wash it, she was shocked to realize that the red shirt's dye ran!!! Her other clothes all had a pink tint to them!<br /><br />While it's a great shirt, be careful if you select the red color, as it is NOT colorfast! Otherwise, it's a great shirt and it was only due to the dye issue that I gave this product 4 stars."
4.0,"I like this bracelet a lot. I work in a professional environment, and I hate having a hair tie around my wrist. I also have a LOT of hair, which is curly, and I live in a humid environment. Hair ties are a necessary evil. This helps. I didn't have any problems with the hair tie slipping off of the bracelet, it stayed put quite nicely. The only thing I disliked is that the bracelet is very small. That's fine for me, I have very small wrists, but for someone with an average or larger sized wrist this could be a problem. Also, the opening is VERY large, I feel that the bracelet itself should be a little longer with a little more give to adjust it. Once I take the hair tie off the bracelet, it's uncomfortable to wear."
4.0,Very soft and stylish
4.0,"It's nice, a little scratchy feeling for chiffon though."
4.0,This shirt turned out exactly as expected.  A great shirt to dress up or down.  This was purchased as a gift and was a great fit.  I would purchase again.
4.0,"This dress fit my wife quite well, but as other reviewers have stated the top portion was a bit loose and the pleats are positioned for someone of around a C Cup or larger.  But the material and color are great and quality stitching.  My wife got compliments all day long for its look and style.<br /><br />All and all a great dress, would recommend to anyone looking for a great looking dress from days gone by."
4.0,perfect for summer.  I wear at home all the time
4.0,It's an okay hat but I'm not in love with it.
4.0,I was so excited to get this but was disappointed when I got it.  It should be label as a purse or very small tote.  There is nothing wrong with the craftsmanship or the materials.
4.0,Let's be them!! No leaks whatsoever...
4.0,Fits my diaper bag which didn't have a strap. Plastic nubs on the pad are a bit sharp. Does the job and is easily adjustable.
4.0,So pretty!! Fits a little tight around the bridge of the nose but it’s so gorgeous I don’t mind!
4.0,Very very beautiful I love these so much comfortable and affordable thank you
4.0,"Fits, but somewhat snug!"
4.0,Feels good. Haven't washed them yet but they feel good as I move in them.
4.0,Nice material. Comfortable
4.0,slightly small around the hips if you have wide hips
4.0,The fit is perfect and it's so comfortable...the color is more vibrant than how it appears online...I've received a lot of compliments.
4.0,"The product is fine, only reason I am not giving 5 stars is color.  If you are purchasing for a specific color in the product image, take your chances.  Luckily I was not but... Instead of pink, black and yellow patterned, we rec'd solid gray and yellow, and white with flowers on them.  Cute enough, the white flowered ones actually remind me of tiny panties she used to run around in at 2 years old."
4.0,I always buy this from new balance but they ran out so I bought them on Amazon good price great fit.
4.0,"Very comfortable and fit good.  Time will tell if they hold up, but so far I am pleased with the socks."
4.0,"The dress is a thick jersey material so, not really what I was expecting.  It looks really cute on, but it really hugs.  I'm thinking it's going to be almost to hot to wear on vacation because the material doesn't breathe a lot. I love the colors though.  I'm taking it anyway because I really like it."
4.0,Love the gown!!!!!
4.0,"I bought this for my sister as a gift and bought a size medium because she prefers an oversized fit (she's around 5'0"", 120 lbs). The sweater was a little more cropped than the image displays and it fits her more true to size even though I had ordered one size up. It's still cute and has the argyle design, it's also comfortable and made from a good material. I just recommend sizing up a few if you want an oversized fit."
4.0,"As well made as the reading glasses I have bought locally, but at a better price.  Now have glasses in all the places I usually forget to take the single pair I originally had."
4.0,The cuffs elastic could have been more tighter
4.0,Love the dress and can’t wear with brown boots. It does run a little big but fits great!
4.0,"Beautiful and unique!  The ear wires are a bit soft and bendy, but the rest of the earring is solid and well made.  Love them!"
4.0,"Nice show charms, two graduates charms eyes were discolored."
4.0,"I’m 5’6” and 165 lbs with a 34F chest. Although the suit fits well and is super flattering on my mom bod, my boobs are too big to do anything other than lay around. When I try to go in the pool with my littles, the straps pop off! They are just little metal clips. I tried crossing in the back to get more support - again, they just pop off. I will probably sew the straps onto the front, cut the back adjusters off, and tie around as a halter. Otherwise, I can’t actually swim in the swimsuit!"
4.0,"I did not actually wear it yet but did try them on. It is beautiful, sexy, and comfortable. I was so happy to find a bra without padded cups. However, it could use a little more support on the sides."
4.0,"Not bad actually!! A bit loose, but not anything too crazy. Hold up well in all weather and conditions! Would buy again."
4.0,I’m in communication with the seller.. his response was quick .. and hopefully I’ll receive a replacement because I really like the earring set.. very shiny and pretty.
4.0,"This is sooooo cute... it really is. I just didn’t like how wide open it is when it’s hanging crossbody... I wear my crossbodies low and you can see right into it. Like other reviewers said, it IS pretty noisy but I found s great deal and had to try it out. Sad that it doesn’t work for me!"
4.0,"It fit pretty snug. Normally I wear a medium/large, but the large was slightly small. I recommended going up at least 1 size."
4.0,Got alot of compliments on my birthday this outfit is cute but the jackets to them run big but pants fit tight two different sizes careful when picking sizes size down it could have the pants fitted tight regardless of jacket they will run big I guess that’s look it supposed to give but treated as if I was famous all the compliments on this
4.0,Great customer service resolved my issues and now they have one happy customer.  Very stylish versus the stock band that comes with the Apple Watch.
4.0,These bras fit as expected and I have washed them and hung them to dry and they have held up well.
4.0,It’s a nice dress but I prefer if it’s lined for little girls
4.0,"Gorgeous jacket, reasonably priced but the zipper does not run easily. That would be my only complaint."
4.0,"I love these sunglasses! The style is super cute, just wish they were a little darker, but I did get the pink so should've realized they'd be light."
4.0,Nice exactly what I was looking for the material is very stretchy
4.0,Moved around a little .
4.0,"Is a cute shirt. But the neck line is too big and doesn't look good, but after all is a cute shirt. My son took it to our Disney vacations and got many compliments about it."
4.0,Great price for a fine product
4.0,"Great glasses, 4 stars because I would love for the lenses to be a little darker but other than that I LOVE them! They even came in a glasses bag to clean them"
4.0,"This is a comfortable cut, although they run about 2 sizes small."
4.0,"First Things First! The physical jacket is VERY purple (#8612a1 is a more accurate depiction of what you will receive). The logo on the back has a ""platic-y"" feel to it and is more pasted on, but has held up very well against several washes and rains! The patch on the arm and the name patch on the chest are both woven/embroidered patches with thick, impressive quality! Also held up against washes/rains. The jacket is thinner, so if wearing in colder weather, a long sleeve underneath is advised (esp. if it's under 60F) but the material is very nice and sturdy without being uncomfortable/itchy. It isn't plush and super cotton soft, but it's still very comfortable. I ordered as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it, wears it almost every day! I believe I ordered a Large and it fits him just fine- not too big, not small at all. Very happy with this purchase!"
4.0,"I like the band and it is easy to take on and off, is comfortable. The reason I did not give it 5 stars was that the removal of links was not as easy as the little video on Amazon describes.  The tool I received was different and there was no little ""hammer"" to pound the link back into place and nothing to hold the band steady while doing so.  Once done, it's a great product."
4.0,Great socks. I bought them for my husband but they run small so I kept them for myself.
4.0,The pant stretchers are easy to use. They are limited effectiveness on stretch fabrics.
4.0,Very beautiful. And the people thing is very very expensive.
4.0,Perfect for our little Pinkalicious fan! It was literacy week and this is just what she needed to pull off the look of her favorite character. 💓
4.0,"Nice addition, so you can wear that very bare shoulder sexy top you want to wear but are not sure if its appropriate for the wedding or other event you are attending."
4.0,Was hoping it would be cheaper here
4.0,"My daughter loves her penquin purse! The chain did break easily, but it was easy to replace with a stronger chain."
4.0,"Several items, a little loose before first wash. Great price!"
4.0,"These are well made, but they are heavier than I expected - they pull on my ears."
4.0,I have not worn this yet. The color is exactly like it is on the photo. I would give it a 5 star if the material is not cheap looking. Too much wrinkles that I may need to iron or take it to the dry cleaner before wearing it.
4.0,Icy white and very nice
4.0,"So by no means is this a dress unless you are 5'1 or under,  unless the hoochie look is what you are going for.  I'm 5'3 and a size 6 or 8 and I bought this in a XXL.  It's a little snug still and comes down to a few inches below my butt cheeks.  I'd rather gather it up a little and wear it as a long shirt, it even would make a nice nightgown due to the soft fabric. I included 2 pictures,  one is pulled all the way down and one is gathered a bit.  I will keep it but I probably wouldn't buy another although I love the nice vibrant turquoise I bought.  I did receive this at a discount for my review but my opinion is my own."
4.0,"This fit ok. I am 5'4&#34; and the torso of the suit still comes up a little short, but I can still make it work. It's comfortable and covers everything pretty well. If you purchase this suit expect clevage. I am comfortable with the amount showing, but it's typical for me being a DD. I bought a size 24 and found it true to size, except for the length. Material is of good quality."
4.0,"This product definitely works.  It's a spongy material, so it becomes a stiff object when it dries -- like cardboard.  If you keep it moist within the ziplock pouch they provide, I anticipate it molding eventually.  So I hang it on a hook."
4.0,They are glasses that work well against blocking blue light. They fit.
4.0,Stylish and right fit. Good for the price.
4.0,A little tight after washing but still very cute
4.0,"Fits as expected, very comfortable"
4.0,I love this piercing it’s just what I wanted only down side is it is kinda long so it would catch on my belt but perfect piercing to use during summer time!
4.0,Leaving on a trip this will come in handy.
4.0,Good cut to wear and talk. Two layers and filter. Well made. Will buy another.
4.0,"Size: Small, Color: Raisin; Me: 5' 3"", 106 lbs<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Color: Let me first start by saying I LOVE the color of this dress and I am keeping it for that reason. There are so many options with these types of dresses and most come in a wine red or a very purply color - this raisin color is exactly what I had in mind.<br />- Pockets! What girl doesn't love pockets on a dress? Pockets are not too deep but not too shallow either.<br />- Scoop neck. I actually really like the scoop neck. It's not too loose to where you're having to fiddle with straps.<br />- Fabric. Material is very soft and I haven't had any issues with static. I am a little concerned about washing as it may shrink but because of the sizing issue I'm not too worried about that.<br />- Length: I'm 5'3"" so the length is floor length for me, it may shrink a bit in the wash which wouldn't be a terrible problem because of my height.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Sizing. I purchased a small knowing these dresses tend to be loose fitting and small was the smallest sizing option they had. It definitely runs big and baggy. Like, almost tent/muumuu big. If that's what you're looking for, buy it. If not, just be aware that this is not a super figure flattering dress. I'd recommend sizing down if possible.<br />- Arms/Sleeves. The sleeves do seem to be baggy along with the rest of the dress.<br /><br />I've included pictures for reference on sizing (I tried to include plenty of different angles).<br />4-Stars: Lost one star because of the fit/sizing but for the price I would definitely say it's a great value!"
4.0,"I bought this necklace as a gift for my sister after she pointed it out to me on Amazon's website. She loved it until she actually wore it and it made her neck break out in a rash. She has severe metal allergies. She is keeping it though, she will have her jeweler switch out the metal chain and parts. Also, be aware this necklace is much bigger than it appears on Amazon.com (look at the measurements and get out a ruler)."
4.0,I normally wear size 10-1/2.  Ordered size 11.  Fit is fine.  Shows are comfortable and look great.
4.0,the spring for watch band comes out easily and lose it hard to find replacements
4.0,I really wish I would have liked this romper more than I did. I bought it as a swimsuit cover-up. The material is super light and breathable but seemed a little cheaply made for me. It fit my upper half well but I felt like it accentuated my booty in a way that I didn't love. Might still wear it in the summer but it wasn't my favorite.
4.0,These collar pins were used in the promotion of one of my Sheriff's Chaplains to Asst. Chief Chaplain. They were the right size and arrived in plenty of time for the ceremony. The disappointment is that they are way over priced!  If I had more time I would have tried to find them some were at less cost. I believe half of their cost would have been sufficient and fair.
4.0,"Great belt that is very durable and comfortable. Love the color and fit. However, it is a little expensive for such a casual belt so be prepared to spend a little more if you want the Johnston and Murphy name."
4.0,They are very nice But they are thinner than I thought. I can see right through them.<br />I would have given them 5 stars if they were thicker!
4.0,"Simple, but really cute."
4.0,"Very comfortable underwear. I love the fact that they are long. I was looking for an underwear that wouldn't pull down everytime I bent over. So far, these are long enough to pull up to prevent that from happening while still being comfortable around the crotch.  The crotch is stitched to give room for all your parts. The only downside to these underwear is that it doesnt have an opening that makes it convenient to use a urinal. Also, if you're a person that works outdoors and sweats alot, your more likely to get a rash/jock itch since the material doesnt breathe like cotton does."
4.0,A little on the tight side.  Good quaility.  I'm still trying to figure out how to loosing these guys up.  They were very cute on our baby.  Lol
4.0,"The shorts are very lightweight and feel not the greatest of quality. It has a built-in soft lining that feels okay on the skin, but not sure how durable the material would be in the long term. The zipper pockets are a great bonus on the shorts as I don't have to worry about anything falling out."
4.0,These are pretty and lightweight. They are paper and one of the earrings was a bit damaged upon receipt but otherwise no complaints. Will by again
4.0,"This hat is too cute, and not too ""grandma-looking."" However, either it runs small or I have an unusually large noggin for a woman, because it's uncomfortably snug on me, sadly."
4.0,"After reading reviews, I decided to purchase a size six for my three year old nephew. They fit him nicely as an everyday T-shirt. And I do mean he wants to wear them EVERY Day"
4.0,"I really like the design of the pants. I did not notice it in the picture online, but when I received the pants I noticed it right away. The pants have a fit that is similar to stretch pants, but can be used as workout pants, worn with boots, or even paired with a blazer or a sweater. So they are very versatile. There are pockets in both the front and back which I really love. And the fit is very figure flattering. I am thinking about getting another pair. But I am cheap and the ones I purchased were a much better deal for me price wise. I would recommend these pants. I have not washed them yet, so don't know if they will shrink or not. If they do shrink I most likely won't be able to wear them, because they fit me perfectly right now. I am very curvy and short so finding pants to fit me is always a challenge. So I am very happy that these worked out."
4.0,"Cute top! The arms are a little snug, but I absolutely love this top!! It is lightweight, just the way I love my shirts!"
4.0,Dislike the straps
4.0,"the dress was somewhat large, but it's due to my wife weight loss, it's a very nice dress and she loved it, so next time we're going to chose a smaller size."
4.0,Nice looking and good quality. Just a little bit long.
4.0,"Beautiful dress, great material, except that the button immediately fell off (easy fix)."
4.0,okay for the money .
4.0,Nice. Thought the word ‘love’ would stand out more on ring
4.0,"the boots seem to be true to the size.. as expected . and they are super cute .. it took almost a month for the shipping but they where worth the long wait! because the boots come from china, I ordered a bigger size my baby is almost 9 mo. I got the 12-18 and she has about 3/4 - 1 inch of space to grow into."
4.0,"Didn’t it was too small. But, it’s still very cute!"
4.0,"It was cute, but the smallest size was too big."
4.0,very soft. light fabric. moves beautifully.
4.0,"It is well made and looks great with my Fitbit Alta, but it is a little too large for my small wrist. My wrist measures almost 6&#34; and the band is more like a bangle. I would prefer it to fit tightly around my wrist and not move like in one of the pictures, but it you like the bangle type or have a larger wrist it would be perfect for you."
4.0,"Nice and big! This purse is reversible so you can have two different looks for the price of one. I really like that it came with a smaller purse so I can keep my makeup and other small items organized so they are not all scattered at the bottom.  As you can see in the pictures, you have plenty of room for other items. As a busy mom on the go, I can easily carry an extra change of clothes and a few diapers for my little one without having to also carry a diaper bag.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about this purse, is to add a zipper on the inside and outside of the purse that away when you do reverse it, you have a easy storage place for cash and change.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,Not a bad replica
4.0,It fit as expected and I love the pockets!
4.0,Little small for XL measurements.  Based on typical sizing chart
4.0,"I can't give these a great review because I just don't like them.  They're just too skinny and already worn out.  I don't like the style and I should have known before ordering, but they don't look as bad on the model.  I'm thin, but have fairly muscular/thick legs, and these hardly want to go on, even though they are my size.  They're also a bit too worn for me - such as the bottom of the leg starting to shred - making me feel like I was cheated out of some of the useful life of the jean.<br /><br />All that said, I know that these are more or less the style now.  Quality does not seem inferior in any way (in fact, probably pretty good compared to a lot of what is available), but I won't be able to get myself to wear them."
4.0,Detail of pendant is nice but it is quite heavy for wearing. Package it came in was not suitable for gifting as the seams gave way to the heavy pendant.
4.0,I used this apron the other day.  While it is cute and made well it did not keep me from getting wet.
4.0,Very nice i recommend
4.0,Love this dress. I bought it in 2 different patterns.
4.0,"I am not going to run a blade over my hand to test them.  They are very comfortable, soft, provide a good grip on smooth surfaces, and fit well.  All the gloves I purchase are X-large and these fit as well as any other work glove I wear.  First time I put them on I was changing both a table saw and a circular saw blades.  I ended up keeping them on while cutting lumber.  They are going in the chain saw case so I have a pair of gloves for sharpening."
4.0,"I loved this dress, but couldn't keep it buttoned over my boobs. It is so cute! Had to send it back. : ("
4.0,"The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because they scratch real easy. Other than that, they are perfect."
4.0,Very practical size and leather of average quality. A very neutral piece.
4.0,not bad for the price.  A little thin
4.0,Beautiful can fit with all event
4.0,Great purchase Gave this as a gift it’s a little tight at first but worked its way and find overall he enjoys it
4.0,Nice set of packing cubes. I bought in blue as well. Compression ones work nicely.
4.0,"Although I received this at a discount price, the necklace is well made.  For myself, I would want a larger pendant. But, since this is a gift for a young girl, this is perfect."
4.0,"Great fabric and quality. Not the warmest jacket tho, you will need extra layers to keep you warm in the winter cold.  The zipper is a YYK but I have had problems in the neck part, it gets stuck from time to time. This is very annoying but except these issues, the jacket is really good."
4.0,i rated it 4 instead of 5 only because of the size.  It is so big it always tries to slide off my arm.  The bracelet is very very pretty.  Just wish it was offered in a 6 1/2 inch as well for small wrists.
4.0,"Works good, like the colors"
4.0,"The dress fit well and not too long and I was very happy. Also, it came a little earlier than I had expected. Very happy."
4.0,I love the pattern and color. This is a very comfortable cotton tank top. My only complaint is the signature at the collar. Otherwise a nice shirt
4.0,"Both a pretty and comfortable bra, but definitely double check the size. I’m between a 32/34 but ordered a 34 and received a 36. Band is too big but unfortunately I didn’t think to double check the size until after I had worn it once."
4.0,It is very pretty. I put an extension on it to keep it from being like a choker. For a small women it would be fine the way it is. Well worth the money.
4.0,I used my coat to wear for winter
4.0,"In the bag it doesn't look like much, but when it's on it is a flattering dress and I can't wait to wear it!<br /><br />The only negative is that it is a bit on the cheap side (not lined, fabric is a bit thin), but you get what you pay for and this is a cute dress for the price."
4.0,Nicely made but they run small. I wear size 7 in Uggs but 7 in these too small
4.0,"Wasn't quite what I thought it was going to be, so had to return it.  Very pretty, just not for me."
4.0,"These work great to keep my feet warm during yoga and pilates, but I wish they weer a little bigger.  My shoe size is 8.5, and the heels of these socks slip down sometimes."
4.0,"Love these, will get more uses out if them!"
4.0,My girlfriend loves it other than the bottom is small. It hard to get over her hips.
4.0,Its really cute. I bought it and I love it. Goes with any outfits that i have. Im so glad!
4.0,"I really like this shirt; however, it was not nearly as loose on me as it is on the girl in the picture."
4.0,"This jacket runs small so I would order a size up. It’s also VERY thin, like a shell type material."
4.0,"I liked it a lot and got compliments on it. I saw a few other ladies wearing the same necklace for Halloween.  Someone gave me the jewel that matched mine that they found on the floor, so I'm assuming it broke on theirs. But for what you pay for, it's to be expected. Mine is just fine."
4.0,This suit is brighter than I thought. The colors are fantastic though. The bottoms less coverage than I thought but still good.
4.0,"4 stars because they are not great quality, but accurate for the price."
4.0,"Nice fabric, comfortable and flattering."
4.0,Very cute but had to add a few more links so it would fit around my neck.
4.0,Love this product design and material. the leather part twists a lot after a couple of weeks.
4.0,"Its cute and fun! I got a lot of compliments on it.<br />The quality isn't that great.It's similar to sunglasses from forever 21 or charlotte russe.  But it is a heart shaped sunglass, it's not something I wear everyday and everywhere, so its awesome for the price!"
4.0,I really like this cardigan. its very warm and cozy. fun to wear. it does have an over sized fit- I should not have ordered a size up as I did. I do feel like the sleeves run short- bit it can be stretched some.
4.0,The back is a lil bothersome. But I like them
4.0,Seems small for a even a woman's wrist. Not certain
4.0,"This top is very pretty, just a little shear"
4.0,"The dress is thin... meaning perfect for summer! I ordered the black and navy, I typically wear a 4/6 in tops and a 4 in jeans. The medium fit perfect. I love that the dress has pockets! Neither colors are see through. Can’t wait to wear it in warmer temps!!  I will def wash on a delicate hand wash setting and hang to dry, not sure the dress should be laundered any other way due to material. Only 4 stars due to color availability :)"
4.0,I needed this for a wedding. Don’t normally wear shape wear but have been felt like I needed it with the dress I was wearing. It did run small. I am a smaller build and wear a size 6 jean and got the XL and it worked for me.
4.0,Great quality and price for a practice skirt.  Could also be used for dancing.
4.0,"The watch is beautiful--exactly the look I wanted.  However, the directions are not helpful.  I want to remove 2 links so that the watch does not roll around on my wrist.  There is a tool in the box, but the directions are not helpful.  I will have to pay a jeweler to remove the links.  Also, the beautiful band comes with a protective plastic wrap.  It took me several minutes to carefully remove it.  I had to make several snips with a scissors.  However, at the end of the chore, I discovered that the plastic wrap might have been removed easily if I had seen that it had been applied the length of the band with a well concealed overlap on the underside of the band.  Maybe I could have found the edge of the plastic and lifted it off the whole watch at once with a fingernail instead of removing it one link at a time."
4.0,feel good and fit good  thanks
4.0,"Loved this watch so much but had to send it back because the metal on the band made my skin break out....just wasn't quality enough.  It was one of the most prettiest watches I have ever seen.  Only wore it for two days and then had to have a hip replacement and was in hospital.  By the time I got home and was able to send it back however, I think because so much time went by or because what I said about the metal...I was disappointed that they didn't return my money in full."
4.0,The strings go around your neck and get annoying after awhile
4.0,"Good quality, but very small, tight fitting"
4.0,"Nice  shirt, it is as advertised"
4.0,"I ordered these because the one I was using came apart.  This set seems much better quality, but will see how long this one lasts and if it will break away completely like the one I have replaced.  I like that the plastic seems stronger and yet still stretches enough to work well.  Since this purchase has several I am assuming that eventually I will need more of them~"
4.0,"Good socks but could be a little thicker, nice to get a hat with it though."
4.0,"My daughter really like these sweep cuffs however, they often slide off her ear throughout the day. That is a major issue!"
4.0,"I needed a headband. This is a headband. So I bought this headband because it was the cheapest, much cheaper than the $14+ Under Armour headband on sale at my gym. It does what I need it to. Did it change my life? No. I mainly bought it to keep my longish hair out of my eyes and the thumbtacks were making my forehead bleed."
4.0,It was a little snug and too short so I sent back original and ordered next size up. That seems to fit a little better. Still kind of short for what I need but it will work.
4.0,"Excellent fit and finish. Athletic cut without being right, stretchy enough to provide freedom of movement. Quick drying and doesn't hold water. Great pants for warm weather hiking/backpacking, or even fishing and camping."
4.0,"Good workout shirts, especially if you want to stay covered in the sun."
4.0,"This top is incredibly soft and comfortable. I was in love with it until it made my entire outfit look like it snowed all over me. I purchased the white top and it completely sheds! I used  this under a shirt as a layering top on a cold day and there was a lint all over my pants and shirt. All over! Like a snowstorm!  I really want to like this shirt I’m hoping after washing it , that it will shed less. Otherwise I’ll have to wear all white every time I wear it!"
4.0,"Loved!! I am 5'6, 150lb and fairly curvy and this dress fit my butt just right while staying at a good length. Its strechy and super comfy, and i love the room for my 34D bust. However, i have some complaints. The lace on the back looks almost nothing like the picture- its skinny, poorly done and looks like it could rip at any second- it looks cheep and there is 0 support or structure (but i like the front so much that it isnt much of a problem). Theres also a tad bit of side boob happening and its quite baggy on the sides of the bust. However, it was easily sewn. Overall a love!"
4.0,Not a bad suit for the money. Get 2sizes bigger than you would wear normal.
4.0,"The dress was very beautiful and more poofy than expected, but the zipper is cheaper and sticky. But other than the zipper, it was great. Shipping was super fast also."
4.0,"I love the comfort, stretch and sheerness,  but I wish it created more lift ."
4.0,"What I needed, when I needed it and at the right price"
4.0,The size chart doesn’t match my true size. Love the dress and the color
4.0,"Fits well, and appears to be durable. I am happy with this product, and would purchase again."
4.0,It was a great mask for my outfit! It arrived on time and made it to the costume contest!
4.0,"Nice knock off of JeffreyC.  True to size no pinching of toes Slippery bottom and they have just a little weigh to them nothing crazy but to be expected with no ankle support bootie ,haven't worn them outdoors yet so the cut out portion and the ankle rubbing test has not been completed. The pinkish color material looks very very good.  Would not hesitate to buy considering how good the material looks,  the B minus fit and the cost"
4.0,"Awesome wallet. Look, smell, and feel of leather. Plenty of space for cards and id window is sweet. Cards fit with no problem at all. No rfid markings, so not sure if it really has the blocking feature. Still have the peace of mind that it indeed does. Price makes it a real good value."
4.0,"I bought this watch band to replace the thin one that broke on my old watch.  This is a nice band, but unfortunately won't fit my watch.  The snap (open/close) portion of the band, that secures the watch to it, is 20mm wide.  Meaning if your watch won't take a watch band of at least 20mm in width, you cannot use this band.  I like the band and found a Timex watch that fits it and am very happy.  BTW - The various dimensions of the Timex watches are provided on Amazon.  Makes pairing a watch and a band very easy.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars instead of 5 not because I have any problem with the band, but rather I was not happy that dimensions were not provided at time of purchase."
4.0,"Its a fairly decent make from Casio, and have yet to see any battery depletion on any solar models since 10 plus years of collection.  I don’t like the negative LCD.  Occasionally it doesn’t sync to atomic signal, which is strange since similar Casio(s) next to it do sync every night.  Amazon did send me this as new but I noticed it was used, since there were alarms already set and few other wear marks, and had to press them for some discount or I would return and buy from another place, finally discounted to a likable number and I kept it."
4.0,"Love the light weight Rayon material and the design. I also like the cut of the Maxi skirt on this dress. It is a little tight in the bodice, so order a size up for good coverage or the button closure will gap. It washes beautifully with other delicates and dry on extra low heat for a few minutes than hang to dry the rest of the time."
4.0,looks a advertised in picture.
4.0,Wore these to many outdoor weddings and worked great!! It's nice they are clear so they don't draw much attention.
4.0,"Very nice quality.  Much better quality than I expected, especially for the price.  Assembling the links of the bracelet is fussy but once you get a technique going, it goes smoothly.  We ended up using toothpicks; that worked better than the tool."
4.0,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it were a tad longer
4.0,"Look great, but do discolor your ears"
4.0,they are beyond what I expected. Really comfortable and perfect height.
4.0,"Very tight sleeves! To wear this garment I had to cut the sleeves off and use as a long vest. Disappointed, but fabric is nice."
4.0,"They seem pretty good for quality, but did arrive having a very strong smell of machine oil. The smell came out after washing."
4.0,I bought those for my daughter and she loves them. Very colorful and easy to install. They give to the shoes a fancy look.
4.0,Very practical and useful.  Good quality
4.0,I'm 5'7 140lb usually buy mediums but after reading reviews I ordered a small . it fits perfect. still long tunic but too short for a dress. only gave 4 stars due to the fact I wore my white jeans with it and the black came off on them and stained them ;(  I bleached them and most came out but disappointed
4.0,"My husband works in concrete landscaping and he’s gone through a few types of rubber rings, these seem to be lasting the longest. Given his line of work I’m not surprised that one of them did break after only a few months but it comes with the job and may have just been a fluke. Otherwise, lasting well and he likes the patterns, which is rare for him. Definitely recommend!"
4.0,At first it came apart but with some gorilla 🦍 glue now it all good.
4.0,"I like the softness and color-design of these socks. They are breathable, thin and very comfortable. Perfect for summer/spring. The silicone strips at the heel help the socks don't slide off and I liked it. I have never used these types of &#34;no-show socks&#34; before.and therefore I am not used to wearing low-cut ankle socks. I just wanted to give it a try. I was expecting little more height on the ankles, and that is my only complain. It is just a preference. I think wearing them with casual shoes and for sports/tennis shoes will be pretty comfortable though."
4.0,It's a nice sweater.  It's not as heavy as pictured though.
4.0,but have trouble with the pinkie fingers.  The inside seems to bunch up and really have ti push your finger in
4.0,Great fit but needed to sew down the seams to prevent unraveling.  Otherwise not a bad price.
4.0,Necklace is so beautiful I love it! Couldn't get my 2 year old to take it off when I first got jt
4.0,"The teeth are great, and look fantastic, and very realistic! My only issue is the plastic stuff that's supposed to make them attach to your teeth. I could never get it to work, and ended up not using them for the costume I bought them for, which was a real disappointment. It's entirely possible I wasn't doing it right, and after so many failed attempts, the plastic became more and more impossible to work with. I'll find a way to make the teeth work, because I love them, and I really want to be able to wear them!"
4.0,Dress is very pretty but there was no size tag to indicate what size it actually is.
4.0,I really love this shirt/ jersey I recommend it to a raider fan ... fits good and feels like a jersey too .... a big thumbs up !!!!
4.0,A little smaller than expected.  I would go the next size up. Not as flexible as expected. Great deal though.
4.0,"Nice shirt, appears as it did online. Not too heavy or too light."
4.0,niece likes it fits as size says
4.0,Very well made jacket. Would have purchased again.
4.0,Love this bra--it's perfect for hot yoga!!
4.0,"Nothing wrong with them, but they were definitely not a girls' size 4, as described. They were even too big for my 6 1/2 girl's feet."
4.0,Satisfied with garment.
4.0,These rings are beautiful and really nice. I'm not sure if I'm allergic to them or that the length is too long for when I go to the gym. I will update my review one my navel heals and I switch back to one of these pieces
4.0,Have a tear under the arm SMH!!! Other than that it was absolutely beautiful so I kept it anyway 😂
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress...IF you get the right material.<br /><br />I bought this dress and it is a thick and heavy material, buttery soft, and well made. I bought a size up, and it was a bit big, but doable, would now have ordered true to size. It is not a full maxi, I am 5'5&#34; and it came right above my ankle.<br /><br />I loved this dress so much that I ordered a second one in the solid blue. So disappointed.  :(  :(<br />Even though the tags have the exact same material listed, they were very different. The solid blue dress was slinky and full of static. It was very thin and shiny, almost what you would expect from a night gown. Completely opposite of the floral print.<br /><br />It's a gamble as to what you will get! Good luck"
4.0,These socks are very attractive. The quality is great. I have purchase a few pair of them. The only complaint I have is the that they vary in length. They don't always cover the calves.
4.0,Purchase hat for my Mom because the original order suite they did put the hat with.  she love this hat!
4.0,Love the watch but didnt care for the way it was packaged and the band one of the stichings came up i just melted it too keep it from continuing but other than that very beautiful watch!
4.0,"Not yet sure about how they will last, but they heat well and are comfortable."
4.0,Make sure to follow to the size chart on the description vs the one provided by Amazon.  I am more on the petite side so the sleeve on the jacket are a little long. I will need to get them hemmed. But the body on the jacket fit me well. The jacket it completely lined and thicker then what I thought it would be. I noticed one arm cuff was creased in an area where the fold should have been but was too long. I had to gently re-iron the fold to correct it. Overall the blazer looks great with jeans or dress slacks. This is perfect for me to wear at work for a professional look with out breaking the bank on a blazer that could easily run in the $100's. I received this item at discounted rate for my honest review.
4.0,These are great quality belts and I loved the look of them but they ran small so unfortunately I had to send them back.
4.0,"Good socks, they were just a bit smaller that I was expecting. I haven't worn them much, but they feel very thin and I'm afraid that they'll wear super fast, but we'll see."
4.0,My son loves them and they are easy for him to put on.
4.0,Its alot bulkier than the picture but its very warm so I'll keep it for function not fashion.
4.0,Came later than expected but otherwise looks really nice
4.0,"Nice Watch, is a little confused but im trying to understand it. I hope you make a tutorial for understand the hours"
4.0,"Very good quality, thank you for speed delivary, price piint excellent. Picture however shows a blouse that appears lined. THIS ITEM is not lined. A better product description should explain this. The blouse runs one size small. Were I not already small it would not have fit.  This blouse runs 1 1/2 to 2suzes small.Thankfully the material is not shrink risk."
4.0,"I don't see anything about the wallet that I would. consider protection against card number theft, but I am assuming it is there somewhere.  My only complaint is that the card slots are so tight that is very difficult to remove a credit card."
4.0,It was a little bit bigger then I expected
4.0,"Overall it was exactly what I expected. Fun and cute jewelry. Some of the balls cracked in half when twisting them on to the rod, but for the price and quantity it wasn’t a huge deal."
4.0,Very lightweight and my grandson loved that I wore them to his ball games!
4.0,The slippers fit perfectly.  The colors are bold and look great.
4.0,They seem well made but they ship directly from China and it took 2 months or so to get here. Once you order they tell you when your estimated delivery is and at that point you can’t cancel the order. If you don’t mind the wait they seem decent for the money.
4.0,Fit as it should. Pretty true to size
4.0,I ordered silver and they sent me gold ones.  I think the price is good and I love to have more than one pair in case of loss. These are very pretty. When I put them on they almost wont close on my slightly larger than average ears.  If you have large ears these will e too small.
4.0,Seems like top and bottom are different sizes.  My daughter ordered this and only wears the top.  Fine for price but bottoms seem to fit bigger
4.0,"This is a good everyday watch.<br /><br />I appreciated that they included a tool to shorten the watchband (although the instructions were not quite sufficient to explain the right way to reassemble the band after removing links. And setting the time with the double step stem is not difficult once you decipher what the instructions are trying to say. The weekday name can be shown in English or Spanish, too.<br /><br />So far, it keeps accurate time. My only complaint (other than the instructions) is the clarity of reading the luminous hands at night. The minute hand's luminous part is only marginally longer than the hour hand's, making it hard to discern their difference in the dark."
4.0,"First Galaxy Watch Active just fine. Fit is comparable with the size S bands which come with the watch. If you wear a size L band, this set of bands may be too snug.<br /><br />Colors are as shown in photo, but like all printed-on-silicone bands, the color will eventually rub off and show just the white underneath. That being said, I've worn the multi-colored tie dye band for two weeks straight, and the color has not faded or chipped at all."
4.0,"Size-wise: it fits well for me. I'm an A cup and it is comfortable.<br />Look: it does look like the image, but up close you can see that it was cheaply made.<br />Material: also on the cheaper side<br /><br />I personally don't care too much for the stitching or quality. I'm not doing anything super physical with this, so, I still like this bralette. It's probably not going to last long with constant use, so if that's what you're looking for, maybe invest in something better.<br />However, I think it is a little expensive for what you're getting. But it was on Prime shipping.<br /><br />If you are a bigger chested woman, I don't think this is very supportive. The lower band is quite relaxed and stretchy and if you raised your arms, you might get underboob coming out. But if you're not wearing this alone to go out, and have something over it or just wearing it at home, I'm sure it's fine."
4.0,"Lost a bet with my team at work, had to come in dressed as a rainbow unicorn. The visibility was almost zero, it got really hot in there, and people on the phone said they had a hard time hearing me - but everyone got a good laugh. Which was mostly the point, so the mask did it's job in that sense."
4.0,"I wore this at my boyfriend's sister's wedding and got more attention than expected! It fits all your curves well and is just above the knee. I am 5'7 and 131lbs, and I got a size 8. The only thing I had to fix was the back around my waist was slightly loose so I had to pin it up (but I usually have this problem because my waist-hip ratio is on the higher side). The lining is polyster so after hours of dancing I started smelling of sweat lol but other than that I'd definitely recommend it!"
4.0,My son loves them. Only downside is the tops have started to wear out (by the toes)
4.0,"Adorable,  but somewhat too small. Still love it!"
4.0,Im missing one but over all its pretty nice
4.0,Sooo pretty and stitching is gorgeous as well. Looks exactly like picture. I made the mistake of drying on low after washing and it did shrink some. Just hoping it will still fit my big headed baby when he arrives.
4.0,Great look. However the credit card slots are tight. I am hoping they will stretch a bit. Hard to slip CC in and out. Putting 2 CC in each slot is not happening at this time. The magnet needs to be stronger to hold your folding money.
4.0,"Cheap mechanism, but great look and nice material... Does not looks like at cheap watch..."
4.0,The septum rings aren’t like the picture they’re slightly off but they still look great
4.0,"I didn't expect much out of this dress. Mine was less than 10 bucks, and I think I got some kind of knockoff that's not like whats pictured. The listing image doesn't show a waist seam, but there is one. The image dress looks to be made of a woven material, but this is a knit. The image dress is below the knee, but mine hits above the knee.<br /><br />All that said, this is a comfortable, cute dress. I wore it with a contrasting cardigan and necklace and [[ASIN:B01IF1FTH4 FOREVER GD61 Women's Lace Up Low Chunky Heel Casual Oxford Shoes, Color:BLACK PATENT, Size:9]], and I really liked the look and got some nice compliments. For what I paid, even with the departures from what was expected, the dress deserves 4 stars. I kind of like it better than I expected to.<br /><br />I'm 5'9&#34; and 225 pounds, and I bought an XXL."
4.0,"Product - to My Beautiful Wife Necklace from Husband Love Knot Pendant Jewelry with Message Card and Box Necklaces for Women Valentines Day Happy Anniversary Present for Birthday Merry Christmas for Wife (B0BP7DR1MN)<br /><br />This necklace is OK for costume jewelry. Mine came completely tangled up and it took me at least a couple of minutes to detangle it. Upon arrival, it should to be ""assembled"" for gift purposes (e.g., take the necklace out and spread it over the foam piece.) The card comes loose - I don't know if the best presentation is to tape it to the top of the box, or to leave it loose on top of the necklace. Another alternative is to cut similar notches in the card and then you can drape the necklace over the card.<br /><br />I included a pic once it is ""assembled"" and ready to gift. I propped up the card for display purposes only."
4.0,Great value for a sweet Homecoming dress.
4.0,"Yes good robe,husband loves it"
4.0,I ordered a large and that's what I normally wear and it fit just right. It wasn't too tight or too loose. the arms were perfect.  I normally have problems with the sleeves being to small but this was perfect.  The material was good quality not thin like some other dresses.  The only thing am little disappointed with is the bow.  I thought it would be a little larger or more stiff.  it wasn't what I expected but its okay.  Overall a great dress for the price.  I will order another color.
4.0,I love the feel and drape of this shirt. I would give it 5 stars if the arm holes weren't so low.  I have to wear a black bra underneath so it isn't so visible.
4.0,"La caja estaba algo dañada, de resto todo bien, excelente calidad de anillos"
4.0,Looked and fit great on my hubby
4.0,"Good one. Product is not a shiny one, so if you like the look it is a good quality product."
4.0,"It's thin, but as beach cover that's a good thing. Liked it."
4.0,"I really like these panties. They're comfortable and don't ride up anywhere. Cotton is usually best for panties ('breathable'), but I haven't had any issues in relation to that, so I would recommend these."
4.0,Four stars because it's not D-shaped. It's a long mantilla with curved edges. I know it's my fault but everything has the same words in the name so I assumed.<br />I bought the black. It has a good weight & it doesn't feel like it'll constantly slip off my head. It looks beautiful on.
4.0,This dress is very nice. I purchased it to attend a wedding as it can be used casually or dressy. It fits as expected.
4.0,Love this bag......great quality n style at great price
4.0,I use this often to keep my hair from a cotton pillow mess up and I also use it to keep conditioner on my hair all night long. Very useful but it could be just a bit smaller. Perhaps it could be made so it is adjustable.
4.0,clamps tight and well made.
4.0,"I love the look, feel, color, and overall style of this bag. The versatility of the short straps and cross body strap is great. The color of leather is a rich brown and matches so many things. The reason for 4 stars is the small opening on top. It is just small enough to make it difficult to get your hand in and really find something. An iPad does fit in the purse but squishing it through the opening is difficult. The more you use it and the leather relaxes it does give to a bit more opening. But overall it needs to be wider."
4.0,"For a DD the cups seems small, but the compression keeps the girls pretty still when running."
4.0,"This is a very cute summer dress.  After reading the other reviews, I went up a size bigger than the size that the measurements indicated I'd need.  I think the sizes run more like junior sizing, so take that into consideration when ordering.  I'm only 5'3&#34; and the dress comes to the top of my foot.  I'll probably hem it about 2&#34; since I want to wear it with flat sandals.  I like how summery it is but also is pretty covered up for those of us trying to avoid too much sun.  If it was offered in a solid color, I'd probably pick up a second one."
4.0,"I like how this comes in 3 different smaller packages that are easier to store. This seems like a good deal for how many styles it covered from the selection. The metal feels sturdy, doesn't look too cheap. It will make a good gift between friends."
4.0,"These are decent. They were pretty heavy for my ears, but then again I don't wear earrings often. I also have sensitive ears, and these do hurt after a few hours of wear. Otherwise, nice little set"
4.0,Love it. Perfect.
4.0,"I got this necklace because it was pretty yet plain for my prom dress. The necklace was very nice and it must either be a higher quality metal or hypoallergenic, because I haven't had a reaction to it at all. The earrings were small and hard to notice though. I would recommend getting a larger pair."
4.0,I love that this is small but holds everything I need. It’s perfect size . It’s small but big enough to hold my large server book and my cell phone. I’ll post an update if things go wrong
4.0,"It's more of a bronze color than the picture is showing, but it is still pretty."
4.0,Love the fit and look of this jacket. Lining is pretty cheap and makes a noise when you move- not a huge deal but a little annoying. Still keeping- decent quality for the price paid. Love that it's longer and a little oversized. Print is beautiful!
4.0,So these are made of a light bendy metal. They are cheaply made. With that being said I’m totally satisfied with the look. They are not too heavy and they’re large and cute. I’m totally satisfied for the price of these.
4.0,"Decent, smaller than expected but definitely worth it for the price."
4.0,Love this necklace super thin line already broke
4.0,I got the 4 pack and these gloves are actually a little better quality then Walmart’s<br />Obviously I’m not outside playing in the snow getting my hands wet but they sure do the job. I’ll definitely be buying these again
4.0,Basically I order in XL for all my clothes and my ONLY complaint about these shirts is that THEY ARE NOT UNTUCK. They go almost to my thighs.
4.0,"Exactly like the picture. Run a little loosely but looks nice  i bought the 12/14 ,fit like a 16/18."
4.0,The only thing I would like better is if the turtleneck was tighter
4.0,This case was just what I needed. The only slight disappointment is that I've noticed people have a harder time hearing me with the case on my phone.
4.0,Soft and light fits as expected
4.0,"Nice, good quality, looks nice on.Ordered the medium, I am 5ft 11&#34;, and its just like in the picture. I am 36c slim and its a perfect fit in the bodice and sleeves."
4.0,Seems to be just as depicted. Nervous that the clasp felt a little weak but will follow up in a few weeks how it holds up.
4.0,A little snug but washed up good!
4.0,"Very cute dresses at a good price point. Thin material, but not exactly sheer. Got two, in the camouflage and the blue circle design. I’m about a size 16 and the XL fits well  I’m larger on top than on bottom, so the chest is a bit tighter while the rest of the dress fits as expected; a size up would be too big."
4.0,"Shear, so wear a tank or cami underneath and a bit bigger than expected.  I still wear it often and really like it."
4.0,Great shirt until I washed it in cold water & dried it on a low heat setting. Then it shrank considerably.
4.0,"Love this soft sweater! Soft, fits loose line it should and Comfy material!"
4.0,I thought it was one piece if so I would have given it 5 stars this necklace is very dainty the gold is beautiful in color and very shiny if it doesn't turn this will be one of the best choices in costume jewelry that I have made and to sum of everything that I have said It's GORGEOUS
4.0,The necklace is the right weight I was looking for 1.5 but it’s an odd color for sterling. It’s white. Makes me wonder if it really is sterling. Hopefully it’ll hold up and tarnish a bit.
4.0,"I love how light the fabric is, I wear these indoors at work both to keep the dust out of my hair, and to hide my headphones. They don't provide much warmth at all which is ideal while working inside. They also look pretty good, my only complaint is that they seem to be made in a rectangle and if put on at certain angles there are corners that look like cat ears."
4.0,"cute and comfortable, just run a little small"
4.0,"The sleeves are not as in the picture, it’s rather a normal T-Shirt sleeve"
4.0,"The newborn size is a little big on my girl's head (as of her being three weeks old). But, she will definitely grow into it! Great fabric!"
4.0,"Great look, but the fabric was not what we pictured. I would order a much larger size, because it seems to be sized for body builders. Very generous in shoulders, but narrow as it goes down"
4.0,"does the job, and the right price. they dont look cheap...look the exact same as picture<br />i still prefer the silk/cloth knot cufflinks but these are nice"
4.0,"Very unique in design and makes a very nice gift for the guy who has everything, unless he already has one of these."
4.0,"the boots were well made.. but they run way too big!! My son wears size 12.5, so I ordered size 13 from a different seller. I figured he would have some room and his feet were swimming in the boots.. so I found these boots, for half the price, I ordered size 12 and they were still too big on him. Once again, my son wears size 12.5 in tennis shoes.. I passed the size 12 to  my nephew who weres size 13.5 and they fit him well. I ordered my son size 11.5 now, let's see how they fit when they arrive. ."
4.0,I received this in the mail today. It arrived quickly and even came in a cute little bag. I've been wearing it all day and like it so far. Will update in the future about how well it holds up.
4.0,"Ordered this because they were supposed to be 12 pair of silicones, but what I received was 5 pairs of acrylics. Size was right though.<br /><br />Edited because I reordered to get the correct item."
4.0,I think the wallet is nice. I wish it had a wrist strap.
4.0,"I liked this dress from the get go, however it didn't fit me the way I wished. I am 5'2&#34;, about 120 lbs and bought a small. It seemed a little too bulky and loose overall especially around the back and neck area. My chest is size 36D for reference. I wish I went for a XS as it might have fit better. The pattern and colors are pretty in person. Cute design. Some people complained about the flowers being blurry, but you really can't tell when wearing it."
4.0,"VERY nice dress. The only thing that I would mention is even though we used the size chart and measured carefully, the large was too big. But my daughter liked it well enough to return it and we've ordered a medium and hope that it will fit.<br />Truly nice design and quality dress. It's very classy and can be worn by a 15 year old for symphony band attire.<br />I've already begun the return process, and it has been EXTREMELY easy so far.<br />Thank you."
4.0,"these gloves are made well and are soft and warm. perfect but for one less star I made due to fact one size does not Fit ALL.  they are far bigger than I had hoped for. . . so if they could make a pair just for females with smaller hands and fingers would be great!<br />these also are advertised to work with device touch screens and I found them to be not great using my phone. one the contact isn't good, but also because they are too long for my fingers.<br />otherwise they would be rated a 5 start instead of 4"
4.0,I deliver so this hat helps on those hot bright sunny days l. I button the side’s to make a cowboy hat. But... descriptions said ladies but I got a kids so the fit is very tight can’t do hair with that fit
4.0,"I was looking for a belt that I could use for shorts without tucking in a shirt that I wouldn't feel at my waist. Most belts have a big metal buckle that you can always feel, so I gave this a try, and it works. I'm not too thrilled with the way it looks - it's more of a tie-down strap for cargo with a plastic buckle. The picture shows a buckle that's different than the one I received. Mine is more plain and is something that you would find on a dog collar or leash. But it has the logo on it, and the elastic has a few logos on it, so it's kinda cool, but still not what I would call fashionable. Not for $40. But it does the trick and I like the way it feels so I'm keeping it."
4.0,"This outfit is SO cute and I was looking for a purple outfit for my son to attend my mom's purple themed birthday dinner. This was the cutest ""purple"" outfit I could find (it was a long search) but the ""light purple"" came and looked more like periwinkle blue....so my sister suggested that I dye it a tad to get a bolder purple and walla! Just an extra $2 for the Rit dye (nontoxic, baby safe) and I got exactly what I wanted. This is the only reason why I took a star off - the light purple didn't seem like an actual shade of purple (to my sister and I at least), but the outfit is super cute regardless of color, can't wait for my son to get in it. Oh, as far as other reviewers saying that the buttons fell off. I went ahead and got my needle and thread to reinforce (no biggy), don't expect any issues there."
4.0,"Nice material, and I like the design. The fit is way small , I am a regular Large and based on the sizing chart the XXL was a good fit. Maybe I should have gotten XL but I did not want a skin tight fit."
4.0,It arrived on time and the quality for the price is right on. Perfect for my son's performance.
4.0,"The earrings are slightly smaller than expected, but they look great.  They'll be my &#34;go-to&#34; choice with a wide variety of outfits."
4.0,"Good quality. Comfortable. Would have given 5 stars, but there were supposed to be 2 different Raiders designs and I received 2 of the same exact design. Still satisfied."
4.0,"Simple and cute. The zipper is great. The length is perfect for what I’m looking for. However, it’s a little tight around the arms and a little big around the waist. The simple design is a great base to accessorize and dress up into something more formal-looking."
4.0,Nice bag.  Quality seemed nice.  I returned it because it was larger than I anticipated.
4.0,I loved these. The soles were annoying though. They are only taped in. My daughter started just pulling them out and the tape dried up.
4.0,"This is a pretty cool novelty ring. I think it runs a little small though. Everyone who spots it is like, ""Is that a Flash Gordon ring?!"" Some people see this as ""The Flash"" but I'm a bigger Flash Gordon fan so this is pretty cool to show off."
4.0,smaller than it looks
4.0,"Okay so this product does look a little cheap. It isn't thick or anything like that. It's basically a sheet of fabric that you would get from Jo-Ann Fabrics stitched into the shape of a dress. I returned the dress because it fit a little bit big.<br />I read the reviews and it told me to size up. I am usually a large so I ordered an extra large. It felt too baggy not ""cute and trendy"" baggy. Almost like a short moo moo nightgown.<br />I truly do believe it would make a cute dress to walk around in on a hot summer day if you order your true size and not try to go for the baggy look.<br />If you are gifted I. The chest area, it makes your tummy look as big as your chest because it just hangs there.<br />Granted I'm not wearing my cute push-up bra or anything in this picture so it's not very flattering anyways but I still don't recommend going baggy."
4.0,"Adorable dress. Ran just a wee bit snug, but it was a great buy. I'd buy another for the recipient...she loved it!"
4.0,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS BAG TODAY AND THE BAG IS CONSIDERABLY GOOD BUT NOT REALLY PERFECT.  THE PROS ARE  GOOD SPACE FOR 2 GUNS AND 8 MAGS AND EXTERIOR POCKET IS PROBABLY WILL FIT 3 TO 4  BOXES  OF AMMO AND EYE PROTECTION GLASSES AND SMALL EAR PROTECTION PLUGS BUT NOT HEADPHONE PROTECTION (TOO BIG).<br />BUT THERE ARE 2 CONS WITH THIS BAG.  1.  THE REMOVABLE POUCH IS NOT WELL PADDED AS IT SAID IN THE DESCRIPTION BUT THAT IS OK, NOT REALLY BIG DEAL .  THE ONLY THING THAT I DON'T LIKE IS THE SHOULDER STRAP BECAUSE  ALL THE HOOKS ARE MADE OF PLASTIC.  IF YOU LOAD THIS BAG WITH 2 GUNS, 8 MAGAZINES, AND A FEW BOXES OF AMMO,  THE HOOKS WILL PROBABLY SNAP AND BREAK.  THAT IS A LOT OF WEIGHT WHEN FULLY LOADED.  THE GUNS WILL BE DAMAGED, PROBABLY DENT WHEN IT HITS THE GROUND.  I THINK THE  SHOULDER STRAP IS USELESS AND I WOULD NOT BOTHER TO USE IT.  AS FAR THE BAG IS GOOD TO HAVE AND I GOT A GOOD PRICE."
4.0,My girlfriend really liked it!
4.0,"Came nicely packaged. 100% polyester. Whenever i think if polyester I think of thick, itchy stuff for the 70s but this was really soft, almost silky. I am between an S/M and went with an S and this was huge on me, felt like a L. Buttons weren't clean, every time I unbuttoned strings were caught around each button - that was annoying. Enjoyed wearing it. Versatile. 💯 recommend!"
4.0,Very strong strap  - a bit stiff - needs to get soft  i guess over time
4.0,This beats the old nail breaking rings by a long shot.
4.0,The perfect gift for the special person in your life.
4.0,I bought a women’s  8-10 and it fit like a size 7. Super cute otherwise
4.0,"Item arrived as described.  It is slightly too small for our patio set - although it is 8' wide and angles, the sun still makes its way onto at least some of the seating.  Also, the wind swept it away once when we left it open (even though it was in an umbrella stand AND in the center of our table!) and one of the arms is now bent.  But, overall, I think that it is still a good umbrella for the price."
4.0,Like color. How do I set the three hands in center. Not the hour & minute?
4.0,Wanted a more silky feel to the tassels as they would swing more gracefully...but will do nicely for my occasion.
4.0,Little heavier than I thought it would be.
4.0,Really cool but fits smaller than advertised. Smushes your nose.
4.0,I didn't really care for the gradient in the darkness of shade.  They are darker tint on top and lighter tint on bottom.  But exactly what I expected from reading the description.  4 stars out of 5 based on personal preference.
4.0,"the color coded switch is low for red, medium for white, and blue is for high setting. Heat comes from the center only adn can take several minutes to heat up. overall I like it."
4.0,"Cute, but scratches easily."
4.0,Great for last minute costume
4.0,I really do love this dress. It flows nicely and I love the pockets :) The sleeves were a little tight but not to a point I felt uncomfortable. If they were more loose like the photo I would've given it 5 stars. Its a great dress and everyone complemented me the first day I wore it.
4.0,I like it just had to be sent back as it came damaged...so a replacement is on its way
4.0,"I like the sun protection this hat provides plus its light color.  I'm a 5'3"" woman and found this hat fits me well.  The brim is so wide that it catches the wind easily and tends to turn upward lessening its protection.  The brim feels like it lifts up about half way or perhaps a little less so it still offers sun protection.  The ties make certain that the hat doesn't blow off.  The neck flat cover does a good job of covering the back of my head and neck, including protecting my hair.  My rating is 4 stars for I'll be wearing this throughout the summer for the sun protection even though I'll be fighting the wind when it lifts the hat's brim upward.  Also the neck flat gives me a bit of a French Foreign Legion feel even though this is not an exact match."
4.0,"I think I paid under $15 for these earrings.  They are very nice, especially for the price.  They were a little smaller than I was thinking they would be, but I would buy them again."
4.0,"Just arrived so haven't worn it. It's a little lower in the neckline than I prefer, for what I think looks best at my age (late 50s). I may be wearing a cammie underneath. It is cute but the fabric is quite thin, altho very soft. I will have to treat this with extra care, meaning hand wash only, if I don't want it to shrink or pill or worse."
4.0,"For me, true to size but just a little too short<br />Would be nice if they had a Big AND Tall option"
4.0,"These fit well and seem to be lasting ok.  I have had them about a month and a half now.  They seem durable, but light and good for hot weather.  I am 5'6"" and these are very long on me, they go almost to my ankles.  I imagined them a bit shorter, but they are still fine."
4.0,"Worked great but after a couple months of wear/wash the sticky on the back wore off so they started sliding off. The socks themselves are still in great condition, they just won’t stay on anymore without that adhesive backing on the heel"
4.0,Smaller than I thought but good quality
4.0,"Nice Ring, Ruby Red and the Gold Accents Everything! I really love the size adjustable band"
4.0,great gift for those who travel long distances
4.0,I liked the leather and the finish but it was larger than I wanted.
4.0,"This would have been five stars, but the product information listed the material as rayon, but when the slip arrived it was polyester.  I think rayon would be cooler for summer wear.  Aside from that, the slip fits well and could easily be trimmed to the desired length.  It washed well, too."
4.0,Just received the brush in the mail and only used it once. It seems to work alright
4.0,I have 3 of these and each one is a little different. I ordered a medium for the first one and it fit great then the red one I got tje same and had to get a large. They are beautiful but only the top is stretchy! I would order in advance to try on for an occasion
4.0,The mediums are too big. Looks like fake glasses that are too big for my face. I suggest small ones!
4.0,"They are very nice, they would be perfect if they had a small pocket. It's very difficult to find workout pants with an easy reach pocket. The fit was just right, so I can't complain. the color was not as vibrant as appears online, but it's okay."
4.0,"These leggings are so comfortable and easy to wear with my tunics probably because they are a little big. However, people said they were thin and I really didn't think they would be as thin as they are."
4.0,The color is great and it has been very useful... the problem has been that the straps are began to unglued
4.0,Good quality piercings. They hurt a little when you first put them on but are definitely worth it. They look pretty realistic and shipped in within about 2 weeks. I intended on using them as lip rings but unless you put one of them on the middle/thickest part of your lip they are kind of big but work perfectly as a septum piercing. The part that pulls back so you can put the piercing on gets stuck sometimes but is easy to fix.
4.0,"I love this wallet, especially that the zippered pocket for the coins. I only wish that it had a couple of more card inserts inside."
4.0,"Great watch , typical eco drive. Baught as a dress watch. Did not disappoint"
4.0,Great socks but a little tight and I have skinny legs.
4.0,"Bracelet is cute itself, the adjustable part and the pretty printing card are the highlights. The pendent is somewhat light and flimsy, will work as the cheaper gift."
4.0,"Very nice earrings.  I thought when I ordered them they were ball shaped, but they are actually kind of flat and oval shaped.  I really like them any way, though.  I have a necklace they will go great with."
4.0,"Very cute and perfect for spring. The color is exactly how it appears on the picture. The shirt is VERY long though and the fabric almost feels like a shower curtain. Despite the fabric and length, I got plenty of compliments on this shirt!"
4.0,"Buy One size larger, it will fit  good then! Wonderful flowing material, very soft. Beautiful color."
4.0,"It's an excellent replacement but it just doesn't fit in quite right in the device itself, neither pair. They'll stay fine for a while but any quick motion could disconnect one side loose from the device itself. Thankfully it's a quick snap back in."
4.0,"Very nice dress. However, it did not fit my full petticoat, so I have to assume that it is not a full circle skirt. Also, do NOT dry this in the drier as mine shrunk. I only put it in there for 15 minutes to get the wrinkles out  and it shrunk."
4.0,Excelent texture<br />it feels fresh<br />Love it
4.0,Lenses aren't green like in the photo. but they are neat.
4.0,"Pretty good for the price , nice and light for hot weather,  fit could be a bit better around arm holes , will last at least 30 to 40 washes and start to get a bit looser and worn .. but overall good for price."
4.0,My wife bought these as a present for me since I am diabetic and my feet seem to feel cold all the time. These have been great to keep my feet toasty. I just recommend getting a size larger than you think you need. I wear a mens 12 and got the XL size and they have been a little snug.
4.0,This are a gift...for a Two yr. old. Im sure he will like them...will have to see how they fit him..
4.0,Necklace is pretty but ended up having to be worn as a choker if I ever chose to wear it.
4.0,"I bought these strictly as travel slippers.  For that purpose, they are perfect:  lightweight, not so puffy and not a bootie.  I have camped before but not a ""camper"".  I think the bootie style insures better warmth; these are good for high summer.<br />Also, I have a women's size 9 foot and the small is a perfect fit.  The sole is seemingly durable if you have step outside and wet weather."
4.0,It was a very cute bathing suit.  The colors on the screen are true to what I got.  But the suit was just too small for my child.  I felt she was very exposed.  Also (thought not negative) the picture doesn't shot that the bottom had fringe.  I would have sized up but I think that it would have fit a little awkwardly.
4.0,It’s a size to big. Would like a XL instead. I didn’t get a return slip is I don’t know what to do to get it returned ????? Please send me a return slip.
4.0,The colors are spot on I got the neon yellow blue and red they are comfortable and the 2nd set I’ve ordered I will definitely order more in the future
4.0,Women’s Casual Printed dress fit perfectly as expected.
4.0,"great tie, perfect for mardi gras"
4.0,"These shoes are very cute and good quality. I cannot give much opinion on durability since they were more 1 time use for a wedding. I definitely think these are better for kids with wider feet. My son has wider feet than most kids, and these shoes were great for that; however, I wish the laces were ones that could be tightened. I found that during a party, the shoes kept falling off my son's feet as he was dancing and it eventually started to become a problem. I may end up cutting the laces off and replacing them. Otherwise, I loved these."
4.0,"I bought the mermaid scales print in XL. I'm normally a large in most leggings, and a size 8 in Target and Old Navy jeans. I'm 5'4"", ~155lbs, waist is 36""at my belly button, stocky build. The XL fit perfect.<br />The fabric is buttery soft. It wants to be see through where it's pulled tighter. But I can't really see my skin. Def not squat proof. I'll wear it at home mostly."
4.0,Fitting was SUPER DUPER fast!!!<br /><br />They are super cute on. I ordered a size up for comfort and they are nice and roomy. I can wiggle my toes around :)...Haven't worn them out yet so I'll follow up with an update soon!
4.0,This band is pretty close the the original band that came with my Fitbit. Love the color. Was easy to put on. Seems a tad bit smaller than the original band. Would buy this again.
4.0,"This beanie is comfy! I like the material it's made from it isn't itchy in fact it's soft. This beanie is great for cooler days and going to be great for winter! It stays in place very well, after it's on I didn't need to adjust it any. The white goes with pretty much anything in your wardrobe."
4.0,I've worn it once so far and it looked great- bright color.<br />I'm concerned about the durability- only time will tell.
4.0,"I had to give it 4 stars because as the strings snagged and broke off, the sequins would fall off, and the material started to fray after wearing it 3 times over Halloween 2017 celebrations. But I give it 4 stars for the completion of my costume. It looked official!"
4.0,"Very nice keychain, the engraved was awsome! The only datail i could tell is they don't specify that part of your text is gonna appear in the box so make sure you know this before you buy it."
4.0,"Very cute, however you'd think with the price the hooks for the charms would be a bit more secure. Other than that, it's quite nice. The charms appear to be in good quality, no flaws/spelling issues."
4.0,"It must be reset daily even if I wear it 24 hours a day. Yes, even while I sleep."
4.0,I bought The large sleeve which feels good around my biceps and forearm but for my wrist which is 9.5 cm feels a little loose and baggy. Overall good product just it’s bothersome at times since it’s not a snug fit for my wrist at times.
4.0,"For the price you can't beat it ,unfortunately I ordered an x- large and it was too big. However making a return was so easy. I  ordered a size medium because the x-large was way too big  fingers crossed the .medium fits."
4.0,"Very cute shorts, they are just a tad snug around the waist."
4.0,"I was looking for Alice in Wonderland accessories for my daughters costume and found this. It felt like an &#34;iffy&#34; purchase, but it turned out great! It's really cute and still not broken, so I think it's well made."
4.0,"So I bought these as well as the AsaNoya crows from them, and they were precious!! My only problem was that they had couple little bubbles and scratches. Otherwise, perfect! Arrived on time too!"
4.0,"First off Id like to say that shipping was a little slow. Secondly I ordered two separate orders of these in the same color and received two different color grays (dark and Light). As far as the product itself, they are a great addition to my running shoes. I use them at the top three holes of each shoe seeing that is where I get hot spots on my feet. After installing these babies no more hot spots. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because of the mismatching colors and slow shipping."
4.0,"They were beautiful , I ordered the pink set but they look more like a dusty rose gold but still pretty."
4.0,"It’s pretty cute. The tutu is a little weird where it’s sewn on, but it’s fine for my 5 yr old who’s not that serious about dance!"
4.0,Love the material not too hot or too thin perfect.  I’m 5’5 220 pounds normally wear a XL I bought a 2XL and fit good.  Make sure you size up.  They do run short so if you are tall I would not recommend.  I gave 4 stars since not true to size and run short.
4.0,Great. covers and stays.
4.0,Great dress!! Fits great but a little long. I’m 115 lbs 5’7 ordered a small. Will have to wear wedges so I won’t step on it. But very cute dress!!! Well made!
4.0,Just what I needed to wear under my ski pants.  Much warmer than thermal underwear.
4.0,"Torso portion of the shirt fit perfectly (I'm around 5 ft 8 in/173 cm). The sleeve length is a little bit too large. The sleeve circumference (if that makes any sense) was really big. I currently weight around 195 lb/88.45 kg (and still losing weight rapidly). Size large shirts fit me well, and I got a medium here, which is what I would recommend if you have a similar body to me."
4.0,Longer than I thought
4.0,"5'6&#34; 116lbs lopsided books one b and one dd.  That being said, it's not easy to find something that does not draw attention to this.  The dress is got is a size M.  The green is pretty and reminds me of Tinker bell.  The dots are a very pale green.  The dress is 100% cotton.  I live in Florida, it's HOT!  This dress is keeping me cool.  I even washed it prior to wearing and tossed it in the dryer.  It held up very well.  The only issue is on the left seem where it is a bit defective  (see pic).  Since I use Amazon Prime, I called and explained.  They offered a refund, but I wanted to keep it, so they refunded me partial.  Amazon prime rocks!"
4.0,One of the full circles came with a different cut. Other than that they look very quality.
4.0,Very cute and worth it
4.0,"Good color assortment! The bands are made of a soft smooth material and feel pretty good against my wrist. Have worn them in the pool, no issues getting wet. Clasp setup is not my favorite since you have to go through two loops to secure the band and that makes it a little hard to do up  sometimes. But it does mean the watch is very secure and that the end of the band is tucked in and doesn't get caught anywhere. When switching between bands one or two of them had to be jiggled a little to attach to the apple watch or to lock on the magnet/latch thing. Great value for the number of bands that I got, looking forward to coordinating my watch bands with my outfits."
4.0,Wore these at my wedding and everyone thought I paid a fortune for them. They were absolutely perfect!
4.0,Very nice me and wife like this a lot !
4.0,"Absolutely love this; the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is sooooo teeny, and the Amazon site’s picture size is very deceiving, and even the measurement given is bigger than it actually is. That said, however, it is a WONDERFUL photo of Shirley, and was a very special, sentimental little gift for my dear Friend who loved and played everything Shirley Temple with me, from the time we met at age 4💗💗💗"
4.0,"I loved everything about this dress, and it killed me to return it.  I am a size 16, and the largest size (XL) is a little too snug.  If you wear a smaller size, don't hesitate, but do size up one size."
4.0,Just what I was looking for. Fit perfect.
4.0,may make to sweat leaving a mark
4.0,"Very nice quality,  nice sculpting support; Flattens my tummy! Also very warm. However, mine are very gray, they don't really look translucent except at the knees. May be because I ordered the light fleece so the material might have to be a little thicker to support it, which I didn't account for. I'm 5'2"" and these fit well length wise. Does not have fleece at the feet. There was a review about the cut off being noticeable but I don't find it so. I'm 120 lbs and these are snug but as mentioned before, supportive. 👍"
4.0,Tight in the arms. See through
4.0,"Present for the girlfriend. Took about as long as expected to get to Australia - but then that's our issue for being in the middle of nowhere not Amazon's :(<br />Jumper looks good. Nice blue colour, just like the pictures. Fits well and feels comfortable (to touch, not sure how it feels to wear it!). Cool design which is just like the pictures. All in all, happy with the purchase, as was the missus!"
4.0,"I normally wear a size 16 so I purchased and XL. Fits great. The only issue I have is that every time I button or unbutton the dress, the buttons get caught in the threading of the button holes."
4.0,It’s actually the only one I’ve ordered from Amazon that almost worked… I am a 36H and it actually fit pretty well but didn’t have much support for the girls!
4.0,I love the sleeves - super cute.
4.0,Beautiful shirt but just a tad too tight !!!
4.0,Nice comfy tank top for Saint Patty's day. Fit just right. Not a cheap throw-away.
4.0,"These were really nice glasses except for the fact that they were much stronger than the .5 I ordered.  I have had 20 odd pairs of .5 reading glasses and these were nowhere close.  They actually made me nauseous.  Perhaps they were mis-labeled. Aside from that, they were exactly what I was looking for; good size, good fit and seemed to be good quality.  Returning them was basically no questions asked for a full refund."
4.0,I am 5.5 and 136 lbs and ordered an M but it turned out too short. I reordered an L and it is much better but it is very oversized now. I kind of hoped it would be longer after looking at the pictures but it is not. But i love the color- i got orange. It is very vibrant.
4.0,"Looks great,  I received many complements one wearing this. My only complaint is that within a month the color was rubbing off."
4.0,Thin chain as expected.
4.0,"Shirt seems well.made..id say it maybe slightly bigger size wise but thats not.a biggie. I do feel the shirt I got which is a larger size,  they did make.print bigger so.I dont like the print as much as I had hoped for. But other wise its seems decent enough."
4.0,Functional with a good fit.  Not to hot.
4.0,"Absolutely love this suit. I ordered a Large because of the previous reviews on running small. I am a size 6 in bottoms and a 36D on top. The large fits great. My only gripe is that I would like the straps to be shorter, even with the adjusters because I am heavier on top. Other than that, for the price it's super cute, nice quality fabric for the price."
4.0,item is easy to install good fit and looks very stylish
4.0,Yes! I love everything about this dress!! I just wish it were a medium and not a small. I’m a large so I’m wondering how I got a small. I tried checking order history to see if I accidentally chose a sz small or if I was sent the wrong size for whatever reason but it didn’t say😕<br />I’m actually surprised it fits me 😩 I guess because of the stretchy material?  I just wish it were a little bit longer it’s right on my ankle but I like it to almost touch the floor.but thts just me lol<br />Other than tht it’s beautiful 😍 thank you! ❤️
4.0,I ordered this earring to put in my upper ear piercing as I wanted something small and simple.  I liked the design and they are very small and simple.  I was disappointed in that I thought they were 18k gold (which I need due to skin allergies) and my ear did react to this earring so I can't wear it for a prolonged period of time.  The design is cute and if you do not have skin allergies than this is a very simple but nice pair of stars.
4.0,Great tote bag with plenty of room!!
4.0,Good oversized fit. This blazer is a nice light fabric. I got the yellow one which is a perfect bright yellow. The only downside is because it’s a light fabric you can see the shoulder pads.
4.0,"LOVE the bag, but it tore on the seam the first time I used it. I think sewing the sequins/thin fabric is really tough so I'm just going to slap some crazy glue on the seam after I restitch...and will put a little dot on the other bag I got as well! But it's a great bag and exactly what I wanted."
4.0,"I typically wear a size 10 and 34 C bra. I used the size chart provided - the Medium was perfect. I bought it as a bridesmaid dress for an outdoor wedding in June. The material makes it light and airy for being outside, but still formal. And you can't beat the price!"
4.0,"Very pretty material and the pin is nice. Interesting design with the loop on the end for pull-through. Elegant, but the shine of the fabric does kind of give it a cheap look. It almost seems to contradict itself. It would be great with the right outfit though!"
4.0,Flattering to your curves but the only thing I wish was i hoped it could be a tummy tamer... But it's not. But still a great buy! For everyday work out or for outside trips (ex.disneyland)
4.0,I loved everything about the dress except the bust measure is too small- about 2 inches from the size chart for large.
4.0,"Nice, but after a while the fabric gets ripped. Even with normal wear and tear the shoe doesn’t hold a lot of use. Its comfortable a good looking but not durable."
4.0,"its a nice material and I do like it but I'm a size 14, 5'3 and big boob'd (36/38 DD) and although it fits it doesn't drop nicely like that one pictured. Hope that helps!"
4.0,It was smaller in size. I expected it to be a little larger
4.0,This bra is not padded but is built to lift and is super comfortable. It's a super practical t-shirt bra.
4.0,PRETTY NICE
4.0,"It’s a bit small on the top half. I wear a large or size 12-14. The arm holes are chest area are a bit snug. Good, thick fabric. Pretty dress!"
4.0,"The dress was a beautiful sky blue color exactly as pictured. It was perfect for my school banquet at an aquarium. It was also very comfortable and light. The only negative was the length of the dress. It was rather long and I had to keep holding it up all night so I wouldn't trip. However, this could easily be fixed by hemming it up or by wearing higher heals."
4.0,Returned it.  It was cheaply made and ugly as hell.  Was way smaller than the marked size as well.
4.0,"I typically wear a size large in sports bras. This one was roomier than I expected. I think I could try a medium but unsure about the band fit. I've gone running in it a couple of times and it wasn't as supportive as I'd like, but it wasn't horribly uncomfortable either."
4.0,these went on easy with a little isopropyl alcohol. the fit is snug and look like a perfect match.<br />only time will tell if they hold up to the sweat and grime of mountain biking....
4.0,Got it for st Patty's day. It fits alittle more snug then I like. The material don't feel bad but feels cheap. It's not bad for a one a year day shirt but not very often.
4.0,"A little bigger than i thought , But they are  Very nice , perfect for my niece ."
4.0,"This is a comfortable, durable wrist band.  The original silicone rubber band that came with the fitbit charge 4 was giving me a strange rash on my wrist with very little wear during the day no matter how much I cleaned the band.  I have no idea what kind of chemicals fit bit used in that band.  That silicone band made my wrist sweat more too because it didn't breath like a woven band.  This woven nylon band doesn't cause any issues.  I was concerned that the buckle on this nylon band would be cheap and flimsy because the nylon band was so affordable.  The buckle is fine - no problems there.  After buying one of these, I bought two more just to make sure I would have another one if I ever damaged or wore out the first."
4.0,"It's comfortable and fit as expected and the design is nice, but the fabric inside the jacket could use some improvement"
4.0,Love the look & feel of this dress
4.0,The item smelled funny when removed from the packaging and was really hard to remove the wrinkles from it.
4.0,It is a beautiful dress! It's nice and long so expect to wear high shoes. It's also alot thicker than expected so that was nice since it's cold outside. I really love it!
4.0,It does fit nicely on my Apple Watch band. My only problem is the app has glitches and it has been absolutely impossible to get someone to help me in case the glitch is operator error. I finally ended up emailing pictures to them today it normally takes about a week to get an email back so the customer service is a little bit on the poopy side also.  My 3rd email in a bit over 2 weeks. But I have medical issues and this did sync seamlessly to my apple health. So in an emergency is in incapacitated my medical history is easily available.
4.0,"By reading the comments and how this is an Asian sized coat and it ran small, I ordered a large n it was huge! I'm 5'3 125lbs 32ddd and due to people saying it was too tight on arms n chest, I went 2 sizes up as one would when considering Asian clothing, n now I must exchange it. It's a beautiful coat and warm but it is way too big as you'll see in the pics I'm attaching to this ... I would say the size fits as expected, I got a large and it fits me like a large. It's supposed to be form fitting as you can see on the model for the product, not loose."
4.0,"Definitely size down, runs a little big but other than that super cute and the quality is good!"
4.0,"I like the top. I just wish it was longer. After one wash, It shrunk and I didn't even put it in the dryer. I hung it up to dry. The material is soft. But I have to wear a tank underneath it now."
4.0,"The hat is perfect and super cute, the mittens are a little big and hard to keep on the baby (he pulls them off with his mouth) but hopefully he will grow into them and they will stay on"
4.0,"I have a 3 1/2 yr old, she is very petite and keeps getting taller and taller. I love this outfit on her, I orginally ordered a 3-4t but I did have to exchange it. I ordered a size up and it was still a little too snug around her glutes hip area and the sleeves would fall down quite frequently. The reason I rated a little higher than normal is because it does look super cute and comfortable and an easy jumpsuit for her to go potty alone rather than worrying about all the buttons and zippers."
4.0,Cute dress was for a family pic on vacation
4.0,"A little big, but nice."
4.0,"For the price this shirt is great. The material isn't quality by any means, but it doesn't look as cheap as it feels. The colors seem to be accurate and the fit wasn't bad. All in all a good buy."
4.0,Strap snapped in to when first trying it on.  But still like the hat.
4.0,The earrings are cute and light. Perfect for my niece.
4.0,"These are GREAT socks. Really comfortable, nice and supportive, with good stretch. But the medium, 8-10 is really 9-11. I'm a 9 in women's shoes, and they feel just a bit loose."
4.0,I love this dress.  it looks expensive and very stylish.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating is because the inner slip is WAY TOO SMALL.  Luckily I have one that works just fine under the dress.
4.0,"I've had the band for about a week now. Overall it's a nice product.<br /><br />It feels very comfortable. Since there is no clasp with a pin to determine how tight the band goes, you can get a very snug fit without discomfort. (It seems like heart rate measurements are more consistent now.) Since it has magnets, if you seriously flex your wrist, the magnets release for a second then return to the same position. It feels weird at first but there are no parts digging into your wrist. I used to get a part of the clasp digging into my wrist - that problem is gone.<br /><br />The magnet is quite strong. You may find yourself (or your kids) playing with it. I have no fear of this watch slipping off by accident.<br /><br />Getting used to the new band: At first I had the short side of the band positioned on the outside of my arm, but strapping the watch on was such a chore. Since the band has little hooks to help remove it from the watch, I just switched to the other side. It still took me a while to re-learn how to put a watch on.  FYI - it's totally worth it.<br /><br />When I first attempted to install the band, there were some little pits of PU Leather that needed to be trimmed off at the points of contact. It would be nice if I didn't need to deal with that, but the fit has been solid ever since.<br /><br />Also, I live in Arizona, and I have yet to have a sweaty slippery fit with the band. A nice perk."
4.0,"Nice dress, fits well"
4.0,"Purchased for my husband. The fit is right on, only the bottom legs have a strange side seam. It kind of tents out at an awkward angle. He won't wear them out in public. Says they are weird. They make good loungewear for a lazy day."
4.0,It was almost impossible to adjust the loops as the ends were stuck into the rubber loop at the end and you need to pull them through to adjust.
4.0,"The tie is a nice buy for just $12.00 but not one of my students noticed the skulls and crossbones on it. Therefore, it ended up just looking like a cheap paisley tie."
4.0,"Thick material, very pretty, shape is a little unflattering, didn't go with a lot of my tops due to the texture of fabric, but comfortable."
4.0,Looks good but almost too small.
4.0,"So cute and pretty, very flattering. Only complaint was that the strap broke before I even tried it on! I will probably resew it back on bc I love it so much!"
4.0,"The green is a bit lighter than pictured, but the dress is beautiful nonetheless."
4.0,The fit is good the light works great
4.0,Super comfy. Material is thin so I wear a cami under it. I can put it with slacks for work or jeans for casual. I definitely recommend it.
4.0,"Very good novel series, but without an English translation I can only recommend it if you speak or read Japanese. The anime is currently airing, and I’d love to read these at some point"
4.0,I ordered a size small I'm 5'3 130lbs I love it. For the price it's great and the color burgundy was like the picture. UPDATE: still love the dress but don't wear if it's windy outside. Or at least wear shorts under.
4.0,"I like the dress, however the sleeves and neck are larger than me."
4.0,The elastic on the back is real stretchy! Other than that love it.
4.0,Gorgeous watches. The men's watch fits perfectly but the women's watch would have to be fitted. But they were worth it.
4.0,"Very nice product ! I happy with my dress , it fits as expected. It was a lil longer but it's ok"
4.0,"Expected a cheap but useful product.  The glasses were packaged with care, including a rigid case, soft case and cleaning cloth.  The clips were well constructed and well designed - easy to use.<br />Unfortunately, they did not fit my Silhouette frameless glasses.  Close - but would not securely attach.  I don't think it is the fault of the clip design - just one of those ""didn't work in this particular case"" situations.  I am impressed by the build quality and careful packaging - which is why it got a 4 star instead of a reject 1 star."
4.0,"I thought the top of the glasses was open but it's a plastic piece. I didn't notice that from the images. However, love the glasses!"
4.0,Nice product but packaging was poor. USPS always jams everything into mailbox unless it's in a box.
4.0,Very pretty I bought it for my daughter and she loves it! And she is a teenager so that is saying alot! ;)
4.0,"Gorgeous in person. Nice glitter to them.  Keep in mind, the heel is not real wood therefore, not hard and stiff.  They are comfortable. I wear them all day at work and the heel itself is not tall.  Super cute and chic and affordable."
4.0,It’s alright...nothing special.
4.0,"Not the same material as the last one I ordered. The last one was more of a sweater. Thicker material and more flattering. This one is nice , however it is much thinner material and shrinks a bit. It’s not as flattering but it’s still super cute."
4.0,"Well, there is certainly a lot of them!  My daughter loves them. I won't pierce her ears just yet, so she enjoys the variety of flowers.  They are pretty sticky at first, but not so much after she fiddles around with them.  Get ready to find them everywhere.  :)"
4.0,"I am a woman with wide hips who fights with a saber. Yes, I sweat a lot while wearing them, but they have saved me from a LOT bruises. I just wish they came in solid black!"
4.0,"First, the fabric is soft and feels nice to the touch. The printing is nice and looks like a high-quality print.<br /><br />The seems are sewn well with no strings hanging or fraying.<br /><br />The problem is the fitment, or the way it hangs.<br /><br />I have fairly broad shoulders and the kimono feels off. It doesn't sit right.<br /><br />The loops are sewn so far forward that a skinny guy couldn't even tie the belt.<br /><br />The part that is not going to work for me is that it wants to open even with the belt tight.<br /><br />It might be great for wearing this Kimono open as it is pictured in most of the ad's pictures.<br /><br />I wanted it for when someone or something gets you out of bed and want a quick cover.<br /><br />It creates a V like I'm wearing a split skirt. It doesn't cover enough even though there's significant overlap on both sides.<br /><br />I've had the kimono for a few weeks trying to get used to it. I let it hang, then lightly steamed it, etc. to see if it solved that problem. Nope.<br /><br />For quality of print, it being sewn well and the softness of the material I'd give it 4-5 stars.<br /><br />Maybe it's me not quite understanding what a kimono is, but it includes ""robe"" in the ad copy. Are kimonos supposed to be worn only open?<br /><br />I give it 3 stars overall for the reasons above.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I need to keep looking."
4.0,I really like these shoes but they started wearing from the front faster than expected.
4.0,"It's more for Fall or spring. Size runs small I ordered a large my usual size. I couldn't zip it up. I ended up giving to the young lady who lives down stairs, I didn't want to exchange it because it took a long time for delivery, and I didn't want the hassle. She loved the coat and had shoes to match. I gave it 4 stars just because size runs small. It's a great product I recommend it."
4.0,Sturdy enough like it.. Starting a collection.
4.0,"Got these for Bridesmaids gifts look good so far, but they do have the threaded stoppers on the bracelet that you have to screw beads over, which is not in the pictures."
4.0,Very classic comfort and cool summer dress.
4.0,"I have worn this product at temps from 30s to low 20s. The fit is comfortable but at lower temperatures, the cold can be felt around the ears.  Similar to the Nike DriFit product but you get two for the price of one. Admittedly, I was a little skeptical because some thermal athletic headbands trap the moisture and one is left with a soggy head. With the Synergy product, my head was nice and dry.  Great deal..."
4.0,Niceeee. It’s sheer lowkey so I wore leggings under cuz it’s brick as hell in New York but I’m dead about to buy it again this year (this was last year Halloween I forgot to update it)
4.0,comy and pretty too
4.0,I am happy with my purchase the veil is soft I am pleased
4.0,I do love these. They run a little big though! I usually wear like a 12 and I think I may have to get the 8-10. But they are awesome and really comfortable.  Just get a size smaller than you think you are.
4.0,"Love the band, but a lot of work to put on"
4.0,Good fit get 1 size bigger it will help you.
4.0,I loved the style and the fit.  Would definitely buy again in a larger size.
4.0,"Okay, if you're looking for a cool beach look, this is probably closer to what you need. For that idea, which is the claim, it's 4-star shirt.<br /><br />If you're looking for something more everyday: pass. It's thin material, it's small, and if you're a middle-aged guy just going to the Kroger, you look ridiculous. At least, if you look like me you do.<br /><br />So, beach bum: great. Normal dad day: not great. But---it's described for beach bum."
4.0,"Pretty cute, sleeves are a bit shorter them if like."
4.0,I really like these and now my teenage daughter likes them.  They ran small and did not fit my face and were tight.  I do not have a very large head and tend to run small.  They are the perfect size for my daughter though.
4.0,"Great sweater,  however,  the sweater looks more like a blue heather not gray."
4.0,"I bought one of these about 6 months ago to wear at work (I'm a mechanic) and it did what I needed it to until the screen cracked all the way across. But that's why I bought an $11 watch: so I could destroy it and not feel bad about it. I wish it had lasted a little longer but the second counter, the stopwatch, and the alarm all make this not just a watch but a tool I use to make my day a little easier.<br /><br />The light is not very effective: it's not a backlight, and it doesn't illuminate the face very well, but other than that, this is a decent cheap watch that I feel like I can consider disposable thanks to the price."
4.0,Looks good.<br />But needs to be a bit longer. Say an additional 1ft with a slight price increase.
4.0,Foley feminine must have in wardrobe.  Dress up or down
4.0,Fit is nice. I am a 34DD. Needed to tie snug at neck for a fuller bust
4.0,"Works pretty good. Easy to use just spray, sit, and wipe. Definitely works best right after wiping and last for about a day maybe a little longer. I really needed something for my glasses with the masks 😷 and the spray helps just wish it lasted longer."
4.0,"Super cute but I ended up returning because the striped version of this suit fit me better. Although the top fit perfectly, the bottom was a little too large. It was too loose and I could only imagine how much more loose it would become when wet. Such a flattering fit and makes me feel better about my mommy body. I LOVE cocoship and expect to order more in the future because the quality and fit is wonderful and you can't beat the price!"
4.0,Comfortable and meets my needs. It feels a little larger than most large scrub tops I've worn but still useable and comfortable. I would buy again. (maybe in medium next time)
4.0,"Blocks the sun out great. Very stylish, lots of compliments, everyone wants to know where I got them. Fits great on the face"
4.0,"I like these sun glasses a lot, actually. They are bigger than I thought but they’re super cute tho!"
4.0,"Quite attractive and of superior workmanship, although only one of the earrings in the pair I received resembled the item pictured, with a textured surface and jeweled detail. The other was smooth and of simpler style, though equally IDIC in design. As this could be construed to further emphasize the Vulcan philosophy of infinite diversity in infinite combinations , I cannot be wholly dissatisfied. However, I do find expressing it via mismatched earrings to be illogical, when a matched pair would be equally appropriate and more aesthetically balanced. This is the only reason I did not give this product a five star rating. I will wear the earrings, nevertheless. If I am questioned regarding the discrepancy, explaining it could prove fascinating."
4.0,"Great product, fit as expected. Why 4 stars? It was a little dusty!"
4.0,"this is a nice ring but it does bend easily, it is thin. I bought it as a fashion ring"
4.0,"So cute, but a bit small. Great color and decent quality for the price."
4.0,Brought for 13 year old son and he loves it!! He states that it fits perfectly.<br /><br />To me; it fits just like the guy in the photo.
4.0,I like the dress and it fits me in the waist.  I will have to have alterations done on the bust part of the dress to be taken in.  It is two bad they can't sell the dress and the apron together and the dirndl blouse separate.  The dirndl blouse that came with the dress is 2 sizes to big.  I order another dirndl blouse from the same company as the dress in 2 sizes smaller as of tonight.  Overall I like the dress.
4.0,"Most of mine were working fine, maybe a few like 4 out of the pack were too dim. But i liked how the switch is hard to press, so it won't turn on accidentally."
4.0,"These are great luggage tags. Sturdy and a great price point. However, if you are ordering ""wine red"", the color is more like a magenta. I was hoping to use these as gender neutral for both my husband and myself, but this is a very feminine color. Ended up ordering another set in black to make tags for him."
4.0,Very soft material. Perfect for a fall day. Was shipped and delivered fast.
4.0,Was way too big and for kinda weird but the quality was good.
4.0,"I ordered “happy birthday daddy “ onesie. & “happy birthday mommy” is what I got.<br /><br />Ruined the surprise I had for my husband<br /><br />UPDATE: after review , company reached out to refund me and correct issue . :)"
4.0,"This is beautiful but instead of Kenneth, Kenny was written. I didn’t select this because he doesn’t go by Kenny. The ring is beautiful otherwise."
4.0,I love it. Just very sharp. So I don't know if the pain and swelling is from putting it . I have have allergies to costume. But I love it thus far.
4.0,"My husband like it, it’s easy to adjust the band"
4.0,"Nice chain, weigh was not as heavy as I thought it was going to be."
4.0,FELLS GOOD WHEN WEARING
4.0,I love the skirt! My only complaint is the inner lining is small. I went a size up because I had read other reviews talking about it and my husband drives a big truck plus I just didn't want it to be tight and I'm glad I did! I'm a size 8-10 and the XL is plenty big. I'm 5'5&#34; and it's pretty long too!
4.0,These look much better on a dress shirt than standard collar extenders and hold up well.  The button head is a little larger than most so it is tight on some shirts with small button holes.  I'm pleased overall.
4.0,"It's about what you would expect from a low cost pair of sunglasses. Worth it in my opinion.<br />They are definitely oversize which is exactly what I was looking for. With a few minor bends and tweaks, they fit comfortably.<br />Shipped in a zip lock bag, in a box with other items. But made it with no damage.<br />It does have the words airforce on the top of one lens, if I wasnt looking for it I might not have ever noticed.<br />Will buy again"
4.0,a litttle bit expensive but good quality and design. Thanks
4.0,Fit like a glove! Got a medium. Im 5'5 and 145 lbs. Definitely ordering more!
4.0,"Jeans are nice, but unfortunately they did not fit well so I returned them."
4.0,Recipient loves the color. The fabric is a bit stiff but I’m guessing will soften with washing.
4.0,Nice ring at a great price
4.0,"I like the colors of the masks.it is comfortable but ,It doesn’t have good texture and after using one week it gets feathers and it becomes lint."
4.0,"It is too long so will get it hemmed but I am short. I like the skirt and the color. Won't wear it until fall as the fabric is an the heavier side, which is fine with me."
4.0,"I ordered this robe to use when I color my hair. Truthfully, I haven’t used it yet but I tried it on and it’s a nice fit. Quality seems good, colors nice, closure works well"
4.0,"They fit me well, however I’m, 5’ 10” so I can see how they may be a little long for others. They are a bit thin/see-thru, so if I did happen to wear them out, I’d put on, flesh colored panties. I also do all my work-outs and yoga at home so that’s not a problem for me. Great for lounging though."
4.0,"I have the complete outfit.<br />Glasses,hat,shirt,purse,phone case,tervis cup.<br />I am living the pink camo revolution<br />I love being a girl"
4.0,"I didn't see the heart detail on the zipper, but it did say women's. Great quality."
4.0,My daughter loves these. They seem fairly durable too for an 8 year old.
4.0,I bought this for my son to wear for Christmas pictures and at first glance I thought it was way too small.  Luckily it has a lot of stretch and fits him perfectly.  I am pairing it over a buffalo red plaid shirt to add a pop of Christmas color to the photo.
4.0,"This birthday outfit seems to be made well and it's absolutely beautiful! My daughter wears a 3T but many of her pants are big around the waist, even leggings. So i was worried about the tutu being too big, but it's a great quality elastic and it fits her snuggly. I definitely don't have to worry about it falling off. I would say it's true to size or runs slightly small. The tank top runs big, but not so much that it looks sloppy, it just tucks into the tutu. But I'm sure a 2T would've looked a lot better, which is disappointing considering the price! She will have to wear something under the skirt, like some tight shorts bc it's very short and doesn't completely cover. It would be nice if something was built in. Overall I'm satisfied, but it's overpriced at $50!"
4.0,"Nice graphics. Quality seems good. Shirt is long, but would be good for someone with a beer belly. Still it does fit properly and the length is a matter of taste."
4.0,Great product but is a little long
4.0,"I can live in this robe. I enjoyed the vibrancy of the color, the feel and overall the fit was great. Thank you"
4.0,"Bigger in size than what I expected but overall they are really cute and just like the picture, just I do recommend going down a size or two"
4.0,"My earrings arrived with no backs, which is weird, but they’re cute"
4.0,They are beautiful!  Super cute and actually warm.  The zipper on my boots shredded them though :(
4.0,Nice looking glasses. Haven't worn them outside yet so we'll see.
4.0,Very comfy and well made socks. Thick and of very good quality. Very soft! Was a bit disappointed as product information says this is a pack of 3 pairs. This is only a single pair. A bit pricey for a single pair of socks.
4.0,Great quality for the price. Looks SPIFFY!
4.0,"I bought a small and it fits like it was made for me, BUT, I DIDN'T GET THE COLOR I WANTED AND HAD TO TAKE MY SECOND CHOICE"
4.0,"These shoes go nicely with a dress I recently bought, and I enjoy them. They are obviously not comfy walking shoes; I have others for more active wear. These I bought simply for dress wear when I expect to enjoy a somewhat sedentary occasion, and I am very happy with them for that purpose. There's really no reason why I would give them 4 stars rather than 5 except that I didn't know how to express the &#34;special occasion&#34; aspect of the purchase."
4.0,It was nicr but the top was too small for my boobs
4.0,This is an adorable shirt. Boxy yet girly and very comfortable! The only down side about this shirt is it will most definitely shrink if placed in the dryer. I accidentally dried mine and it shrunk to where its uncomfortable for me to wear. I am 5'2 138 lbs and I got a size small and it fit GREAT before I dried it. I may buy it again because I liked it so much --- just watch out and make sure you don't stick it into your dryer!!
4.0,I’m very satisfied with this dress. I’m 5’1” and 158lbs and ordered the large. As expected I had to take about 6” off the bottom and re-hem it but I’m short and I need to do that with most dresses. The colors are as pictured and the fit is good. Very friendly for girls with a fuller midsection.
4.0,This was a great find for my grandson. He bought them for is mother & sisters for Christmas. Their school colors are Red & white. He was excited & were love by everyone!
4.0,Good material. Exactly as describe.
4.0,I took in some of the heaviness below the waist by sewing the seems closed.  Fits much better for my size.  Comfy.
4.0,Really like earrings wish it would come with backing on them
4.0,I wouldn't suggest this for running. There's not a lot of support.
4.0,"The finished product will have you shaking your head with joy but there's a lil agony putting the ""Camaro"" sticker on. But, if you take your time and have some tweezers you can get it right."
4.0,nice bag!!!
4.0,"This is a good belt for the price. After a few months of use, the belt is starting to fall apart a bit and the screw snapped off when I was tightening it the other day. I was able to reassemble it though so that was good 🙂"
4.0,To watch GOT
4.0,"Great fit, great finish, the usual Mountain Hardwear quality. My one gripe, only because I didn't see this mentioned anywhere on any site or any review of this piece before purchasing, was that the liner is somewhat ""rubberized""? for lack of a better term.<br />The fabric is nice and thin so technically lightweight, there is a small amount of stretch or flex which is nice, and the liner is soft to the touch to slide over clothing easily, but I do believe the unique liner may have been a big factor/part of the reasoning behind the longer than necessary front zipper. I guess you can call the jacket breathable but that is way more due to venting than the actual fabric.<br />In high activity you're always going to sweat in a hardshell, I just think that may be extra true for this piece due to the liner. So again overall a pretty good jacket, just taking one star off due to the lack of clarity in the product details. Maybe i just should have done a deeper dive into the Paclite fabric...."
4.0,Was Amazing thank you
4.0,"These are very comfortable, and feel great as you wear them. The stitching around the butt it a bit weird and causes a weird feel, but still overall a good pair."
4.0,Length is much longer than anticipated. Everything else is great.
4.0,Dress looks just as advertised. Nice dress for work. Please pay attention to the size chart..normally wear a small but had to return because it couldn't fit..order a size or two up.
4.0,"Nice, cheap Jersey."
4.0,"Beautiful, but it gets caught In clothing.Just be careful when weearing."
4.0,runs short.
4.0,"The print is so cute everyone commented on my dress. The dress is very well sew, however the material of the dress is bit thin. But I had no problem with it it held up very nicely for my event . Just wash and it's in perfect condition."
4.0,Very durable but could be a little easier  to screw on
4.0,I love the chains but I wish the remaining chain that dangles was longer.
4.0,Great summer/fall dress. I plan to wear it with a cardigan when it gets cooler outside.
4.0,"Very sheer, light and breezy.  Will not be bulky around your neck."
4.0,"The watch it's self is nice, bit so big that I can't even wear it."
4.0,the strap in the back not strong
4.0,Looks nice feels very comfortable
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, well made and true to size. However, it’s heavy! I mean I could feel it like I’m having something pretty heavy on me and could not wait to take it off. I had feeling like it was pushing me down....  I love the dress itself and will definitely wear it again but not as often as other dresses that I have due to the heaviness. Other than that great purchase"
4.0,Sore calf muscle.
4.0,"Wife loves this top.  Big Halloween fan, so I got this for her to wear in October.  It seems to run a bit large.  I got the size she would normally wear and I could have gone a size down.  Other than that, top seems fine."
4.0,"I picked the wrong size so I need to loose some weight! I have large hips, thighs and butt so tight across that area."
4.0,Watch is attractive and extremely easy to read. Only negative is that it is quite large around the wrist. Just got it today and will wear it for a day to see if it turns around on my wrist. That would be very annoying and if it does I will have to return it.
4.0,its a bit big on me very nice though
4.0,"This hat is mostly a black plastic vinyl material with some insulation material between the layers and fit my head fine. Some soft, elastic material around the bottom to hold it on. It is a nice hat for times when it is a wintery mix or raining and keeps cold liquid rain off your head. This hat would probably make your head sweat if you were active or in the sun with it on, since it doesn't have any ventilation in it. It doesn't have any decorations on top, so it could easily be worn under a hooded shirt or coat hood."
4.0,"The Wise Owl Accessories Slim Minimalist wallet fits ideally for travelling use where a limited number of ID and credits are carried.<br /><br />The wallet has a lot of credit slots (a total of 9 if all are used to storing credit cards). I am not sure about the RFID feature as my understanding is that the credit cards are needed to be enclosed by RFID protective materials. The 5 credit card slots located on the outside may not be RFID protected.<br /><br />There is a small zippered case for a small number of coins. The inner slots could be used for storing currency folded. These slots are only large enough for may be a few currency bills.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice compact wallet if we only need to carry a few ID, credit cards, and currency."
4.0,"I like this. It's very pretty and it hides the parts I want hidden. I get a lot of compliments. It's a little frustrating to have to keep pulling the top back into place, but it's worth it. Good dress."
4.0,"Great quality, the printing is gorgeous. Runs larger than expected."
4.0,Works well with some tops not others. Good product for those with sloping shoulders.
4.0,Not quite the quality I expected but still good
4.0,it is so cute but it fit a little tight for a M.
4.0,"Great boot<br />Very sophisticated looking.<br />Comfortable<br />Runs 1/2 to one size too big.<br />I ordered a 7, which normally I wear a 6.5 to 7.<br />I recommend to size down 1/2 size."
4.0,They are very synthetic and a bit bright for my taste.  The patterns I received would be better for kids than adults.  They do keep the hair out of my face however.
4.0,As pictured. Thin bendable ring. Do not wear if doing anything labor work related. It pokes my finger when lifting items and working. Nice ring. For delicate show
4.0,"I have other WrightSocks and they are a bit thicker, which I like better, but these are a good alternative for the summer."
4.0,Nice way to give a fresh look..
4.0,I really like this - very cute!
4.0,I only gave it four stars because I’m tired of wearing a mask on my face. Lol. However given the nature of the emblem on this mask it should get five stars. Got many the compliment from people of my generation who recognized the symbol. Overall worth the purchase. It’s comfortable and adjustable. Arrived as described.
4.0,AWSOME backpack! Fits a ton of stuff and is so sturdy. I was shocked by the good quality for the small price I paid. Only problem is it didn't fit my extra larger binder well.
4.0,"I think for the price, you can't beat it.  The frames are sturdy and so was the build quality.  However, it didn't quite fit my face the right way so it was hard to adjust it.  It wouldn't be so bad after-all, however, as mentioned above, the built quality is very good.  So I found it difficult to adjust the glasses to my face.  Another thing that I didn't like about it was the tint.  In the picture, the tint seems very dark.  But once you put the glasses on in person, the tint isn't so dark after.<br /><br />Pros -<br />1. Sturdy<br />2. Built quality is very good<br />3. Sleek and minimalistic design<br /><br />Cons -<br />1. Hard to adjust to your face<br />2. Tint wasn't dark enough"
4.0,I used it for  work. It could have been better if they put a button on the sides.
4.0,"My face gets burnt / chapped easily by the combination of wind/sun/cold. Ihis hat is great for those cooler  in-between days in the 40's & 50's, possibly even the 30's.  I like the fact that you can stuff the face mask and ear flaps up  into the hat if you get a little too warm, then pull them out again if you turn into the wind or shady street.  I did try it on a day in the 20's and it just wasn't warm enough for my ears, even tho I had a full balaclava under it."
4.0,It is very beautiful and almost fit perfectly. Thank you.runs slightly on the bigger side.
4.0,Beautiful dress. Xxxl is more like a size us16. Very short. Good quality and color.
4.0,"Great shirt, just a little too large."
4.0,"Nice sunglasses.  They look a little high end, at least they do to me."
4.0,"We got this as a gift for our friend. We sized up just to be safe (she is a size 4 ladies, very lean) and got a size M and it was a little loose. One wash and it should fit perfect."
4.0,Super cute! Fits perfect! Yaaasss hunty
4.0,"Love this sweater, wear it all the time"
4.0,I loved the material and the city if the dress but it's just a bit small. Really adorable though and seemingly well made.
4.0,"I find them to be comfortable. I have use them for grappling Jits, Judo, Sambo.<br /><br />They have held up for a couple months so far. They have just enough grip and slippage on the mats to keep footing without injury from not slipping on throws. They do not offer any support or protection though.<br /><br />They seem to stay in place rather than bunching up or twisting around.<br /><br />Update: they shredded to pieces after a couple months of use."
4.0,Awesome! I’ve been looking for grommet belts with gold hardware forever and these are great. I’ve worn them a couple times already and get lots of compliments
4.0,Fits well. Washes well. Material is thin.
4.0,"It fits great but it's so very very thin that even the built in slip doesn't cover much. Having said that, it's terrific for tossing on top of bathing suit or when lounging around the house."
4.0,"Nice dress but it runs big. The ruching won’t stay in place over my butt, which makes it poof up and look odd. I’m 5 months pregnant, 5’4” and 115lbs and the small is still too loose. Would never work for me if I wasn’t pregnant."
4.0,great fit. color i had been looking for
4.0,I wore this shirt a couple of times last summer for some beach parties. It was fun and I got a lot of comments. The only issue I had with the shirt is that it runs pretty large. But it was very comfortable and breezy. I definitely like it.
4.0,These seem to be really good quality - much better than I expected.  I'm happy with my purchase!
4.0,"I've had this ring for the past 7 months, and it's been great so far. As if you couldn't tell from the pictures, the matte part of the ring is really thousands of very fine grooves running down the middle of the ring, which is both good and bad. Good, because it looks pretty cool how the lines reflect the light. Bad, because those grooves collect dirt (mostly skin oil from your hands) very quickly, making the ring look rather dirty. It is especially apparent after you wash your hands, the ring is very silvery and shiny, but within 5 minutes it collects dirt and gets darker and dull. Not necessarily bad, the dark look is nice sometimes, but I get tired of the ring changing colors several times per day. Another downside of the grooves is that they are susceptible to scratches easier than the polished parts, because the actual metal is thinner within the walls of the grooves. Trust me, nobody will notice except you when you examine the ring (I'm rather OCD), and I'm very hard on my hands, therefore the rings sees lots of abuse.<br /><br />Metal Masters' customer service is great as well, I am an 8 in all rings except this, so I ordered an 8 which was too big and it was exchanged for a 7.5 without a hitch. Otherwise, the ring is solid as a rock, comfortable all day (and night if you eat too many potato chips!), and is an excellent value, worth well more than the $25 Metal Masters charges for it."
4.0,"They look nice and feel warm, but may be a little small for the person they are intended for."
4.0,"The material is different than I expected, and the fit is a little snug but I read the other reviews and expected this.  Make sure you read the sizing chart and don't just go with what you would normally get. I really like the classy look of this dress!  I will be ordering it in other colors.  Dresses with pockets that don't stick out in weird ways are hard to find, and this dress does it right.  Definitely a staple to add to your closet ladies."
4.0,It look good on my wrist
4.0,I am 5'3&#34; about 190 lbs. I typically wear about a 16 in pants and medium/large shirts. I am smaller up top than on the bottom. I ordered the 12 and it fits pretty well. The cups sit kinda weird but I love it.
4.0,Too smal . I wanted a medium size
4.0,"These boots fit exactly as described. However, like many other reviews have described, they do emit a strong plastic smell. Hopefully will fade with time."
4.0,I like these glasses the only complaint would be one of the screws keeps coming loose.
4.0,As is with Affliction items the graphics are unbeatably awesome. Shirt material is kind of thin. Will be a victim of belly holes.  Good for a wear or 2. I buy for the design.
4.0,very pretty loved it
4.0,They looked dull compared to the picture but are still pretty.
4.0,"These are nice for the price. They scratch easily and get caught in your hair if you wear them on your head. They are not polarized, so if you need something to help with the reflection of water or snow.. this are not it. They are not heavy and fit well. I needed them in a crunch because I lost a screw holdin my $300 pair together before vaca. These are very cute and typical aviators, meaning if you have full cheeks, they will lift up when you smile :-) If you are on the fence and need an inexpensive pair of sunglasses, these are a good one to have in your supply."
4.0,"Love these earrings, not too big or too small"
4.0,"the dress it self is very nice, good material. But there small is still big for me, and I'm 5'5 105 pounds, but other then that its great, i still will wear it"
4.0,"It runs small, but super cute!! Nice quality"
4.0,"Nice breathable material, very comfortable. Used it under my renaissance costume."
4.0,"Adorable necklace. It came really early which was unexpected. I haven't worn it yet, but I can't wait to. My clock didn't work, but I didn't know it was supposed to. I thought it was just for style. After reading reviews I kind of wish it did though. Very cute necklace though. I love it!"
4.0,The straps were 2-1/2” too long so they had to be taken up. However besides that small flaw it is worth the price. Flattering shape and the fabric is what is expected from an amazon clothing order.<br />I have washed it twice on cold and dried it on casual and have not had any issues. I ordered the XXL but the XL would have been ok. I am a size 14 in other tops.
4.0,smaller than I expected but look great with the necklace I have. They were shipped quickly and were packaged very well
4.0,The top is very cute and i love the color. However mine does not scrunch as much like the one in the picture and i got a size small. Still a cute top and will be worn!
4.0,"There's a size chart in one of the pictures at the upper left of the main Amazon page, but it's by measurements of your ankle and calf, not shoe or sock size. Fortunately, looks like this large size is stretchy enough lengthwise to fit pretty much any foot attached to the right size ankle and calf. The foot goes from 8-1/4"" to past 11-1/2"" at a reasonable stretch (for compression socks), which corresponds to men's shoes sizes &lt;6 to past 12, women's 4 to past 13.<br /><br />The compression on my rather lean lower legs is fairly mild as advertised but definitely there. Wouldn't want to wear these when I didn't need the compression.<br /><br />The fabric is fairly thick and substantial, 68% polyester, 23% nylon, 9% Lycra.<br /><br />The toe seams are medium sized and fairly hard.<br /><br />Machine wash cold, no bleach, tumble dry low heat, no iron."
4.0,"Very pretty earrings, although larger than I expected them to be."
4.0,"These seem to be pretty good work gloves,  but not a mechanic's glove. They are too stiff. Overall they are good work glove which is what I wanted."
4.0,I ordered a size up based on reviews...I could have gone up to sizes and been ok.  They are very comfortable.
4.0,"I’m not sure what I weight, maybe 170, and I’m 5’2”, bought and XL and it fits perfectly, even the length of the pants is right and that never happens.<br /><br />Let me be perfectly honest here, this isn’t fashion, it’s not the cutest thing but it’s SO COMFY. I will be wearing it all fall and winter."
4.0,I had to go up one size due to the arms being very snug. The lace around the neck line is a little too high but other than that the blouse is absolutely stunning.
4.0,"Great fit...Great looking, thought it would be a bit bigger, would also look better with a stone at the top"
4.0,"I love this suit, I just really wish it was a bit longer! I am 5' 8&#34; and 160 lbs and got the largest size available, but it is still just shorter than I'd like. It's so cute and flattering though, it's worth constantly pulling it up to keep the girls from falling out!"
4.0,I love the way they feel and fit two thumbs up.
4.0,"The dress fits a little loose, but it is fine. The real issue is that this dress is not ivory. It is yellow. This dress will not work for the wedding."
4.0,Beautiful dress! Only issue the color was wrong. I ordered burgundy and it was red instead.
4.0,Zipper does not align and looks cheap
4.0,"Very beautiful and baggy, comes on time and i wear it non stop"
4.0,Helps keep my Casio protected
4.0,"Well, my husband LOVES what this does to my cleavage, and as other reviews say, the cups do run small by one size.  Sadly I don't think I had an option to go up a size, so I risked it.  I spill out a bit, but the nipple and areola are covered, so as long as shirts aren't skin tight, the overflow of boob isn't a big issue.  Brand isn't important to me as the product is super comfortable and gorgeous, and I feel sexy wearing it!  For the cost and how fast it shipped, it was worth purchasing and I will buy from them again."
4.0,"I was genuinely surprised by the quality of this bag. I originally bought this because I needed a messenger bag for a trip, but I will be using this more often.<br /><br />The only thing keeping this from a five star review is the the Velcro is very weak and the strap has no cushion. Both may or may not be an issue for people depending on use.<br /><br />Either way, this is a great bag for the price. I would certainly recommend it."
4.0,Pretty and unique dress. Sizing was not precisely as described.
4.0,"I love the look of this dress. It was a little frayed which I didn't care for but it looks great, received several compliments"
4.0,"This bolero fits well, but it is a little looser and longer than I was hoping for.  Some shirts and dresses just need a little extra cover to be work appropriate and this does that.  I just don't wear this one when the dress/shirt has a really pretty back that I don't want covered."
4.0,These came sooner than expected and look very nice!  They are about an inch too long for my arms but someone with slightly longer arms would fit great! They will still look great with a renfest costume.
4.0,"Got a small for my gf.  Most stuff is way too big on her but this fit nicely.  She’s a little taller than average, so it was a little tight in the crotch, but that’s what I was going for so she didn’t complain."
4.0,My daughter is a size 0 to 2 and 5 feet 2 inches. The top fit perfect the pants fit her waist good but the were long so they were dragging on the floor.  They have a slit at the foot of the pants so we tied it to keep the pants from dragging
4.0,Good size and color. Works for me!
4.0,"Maybe each color fits a bit differently but I bought up a size to an XL...and I would consider myself to have broad shoulders...and the button for the outer swoop is drooping to almost my armpit. It is super baggy, and the points in the front go just below my knees. I am about 5’ 5 1/2”. Sleeves are very big-not necessarily long. There is no way the back is longer than the front on this - mine sits just below my butt. Comfy-definitely, but I may try the size M or L instead. I am about a 38C and the front would show my chest if I didn’t wear a cami underneath."
4.0,It's a little thin but I expected that. It comes with a button and hoop. I removed it bc I have a brooch. All in all I'm happy
4.0,Looks great and Sr vice was so fast I was surprised.
4.0,"A nice plastic case, nicely lined, but kind fat. I keep it with my swimming gear when I go to the gym."
4.0,"This makes me feel extremely sexy. Even as a bigger girl. It is a bit tight around the body just under the breasts for me personally, not suffocating tight. It's beautiful and loose, but not too loose around the tummy. Not to bad, I would just MAYBE get a larger size next time but just because of my own personal preference and not because it was too small, but for the price and the way it makes me feel, it is amazing. I wear it even when I'm alone just to make myself feel good. I got some leg ribbon garters in exactly the same color and they all look great together. Also just to add, I have a strange body shape. Almost everything on me is petite, small, and thin accept for my belly. My torso is short, but my belly is definitely there. I wear children's shoes, I have small hands, small facial features, (except for my forehead, it is like half of my face, lol) no butt or hips, slightly above average, but not enormous neck and shoulder pain breasts. The shape I would say my body is closest to as far as labeling it would be apple."
4.0,Beautiful blue cotton dress....only thing is it runs very large.<br />My mom has varicose veins so she likes longer dresses and she like sleeves to hide her flabby upperarms.<br />The fabric is light and breathable.  Order 2 sizes down.
4.0,I usually wear a M/8. I purchased this in a S and it fit ok except the arms were way too tight. With 3/4 sleeves it makes it uncomforable. Pretty dress but not a big fan of material.
4.0,"I like these, they’re not too hot, i like the adjustable straps and the colors, but for some reason it hurts my nose. The wire makes it feel like you’re wearing glasses or something and it hurts after a while. I’m hoping I get used to it because that’s really the only negative thing"
4.0,I'm pretty happy with this one! The fact that it came with the tool to help you adjust the wristband is pretty awesome! It was pretty easy to adjust too. My husband did it within 20mins . Definitely a nice one to wear when he uses his formal attires!
4.0,"The shirt is super cute but does not fit as shown, I am larger chested and ordered up and is not as long as shown, but i still like the shirt"
4.0,"These do look good in the ears, adding sparkle."
4.0,"For as cheap as it is this is a great costume. The stitching was coming apart a little at the seem of one of the thumbs but otherise it was great.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this costume runs small. I am just under 5'7 and normally where either a medium or a small, but this costume was exceptionally tight on me. I fit into it, but if I was going to order it again I would get a large."
4.0,Very stylish! I was very happy with my purchase. I wear it to work almost everyday for eight hours and it is very comfortable. I will buy again if there are other colors
4.0,At first when they came in I thought they were &#34;alright&#34; but now I'm attached to them. I guess I just had to get comfortable with them!
4.0,Soo soft. bought 2 designs. I like both. Deep neck .Soo wear inner wear if needed. It has pockets.
4.0,"This a lovely bracelet that sparkles and shines. There are ten rows of rhinestones that catch the light with every movement. I received the Silvertone Rhinestone Stretch Bracelet at no cost to review and it is lovely. It would be great for a dressy occassion or formal events. The bracelet seems to be well made and with repeated stretching to put it on and remove it, none of the stones have fallen out and the bracelet hasn't become distorted or uneven. It has returned to it's shape each time. The underside of the bracelet is smooth and I haven't had any trouble with pinching.<br /><br />This bracelet is rather small and even though it has stretch, it is going to be very uncomfortable on a larger wrist. I have fairly smalll wrists at about 6 1/8 inches around on the right and just a 16th of an inch larger on the left. The outside measurement of the unstretched bracelet is about 7 1/8 inches. I can wear it comfortably on the right wrist, but it borders on uncomfortable on the left wrist and causes the veins in my hand to stand up. It would be nice if the bracelet were offered in different sizes to accomodate the different sizes of wrists out there.  I do like it though. The bracelet is very pretty and constructed really well."
4.0,"It is a bit surprise to us when the glasses arrived with gold frame, despite the pictures show a silver frame and a black frame and the description said silver frame. Gold color is not that bad. Just beware the glasses may not fits well if your head size is big (width). My wife has a small head and she say the glasses is tight but OK. The metal frame and hinges adds to the weight so it is a bit heavy compare to a non-foldable plastic frame.  The palm size pouch is sturdy and small well fits into her purse. Overall, she like the glasses for ease of carry (great for traveling), price ($15 (with tax) for 2 pairs) and great as additonal spares."
4.0,"Good quality and decent price. The gloves are a little bit smaller and I recommend to get one size up. The glove is light and fuzzy inside, comfortable to wear."
4.0,"It is a beautiful hoodie it had a little hole on the right shoulder, but nothing that I cannot fix here."
4.0,"I bought the blue and white striped dress in Large and it fits perfectly. I have found that the most helpful reviews on clothes are the ones where ladies share their size/body type, so here goes: I am 5'8 and curvy. 175 lbs with 38 DD bust, a big butt and a tummy from having two kids. The drop waist with the draw string really allows for hiding a tummy. With my height and big butt it is a bit short, but I'm ok with that. I've worn it out running errands and also out for beers with my man. It's super cute paired with a fun pair of Chucks."
4.0,Was a bit skeptical.  Received it and I'm happy with my purchase.  I like the print and the fabric.  Sometimes in looking for prints it 's not the heavy/stiff material that you receive.  This was the stiff-like material.  Its a one size fits all so its adjustable (I think) for everyone.  A good buy.  I am happy with my purchase.  I plan on looking into other patterns to add to wardrobe.
4.0,These are pretty nice but they are very very thin material bordering on see through. Other Neleus tanks I ordered were a lot thicker mesh material. The thinness of these makes you feel cooler though.
4.0,"A few of these fit perfectly, and a few feel a size too small. It is the same with other underwear from this manufacturer."
4.0,"Looks good, feels good, and worked well.<br /><br />I have a bit of a gut which put me between sizes, and I went with the larger of the two.  That was a mistake.  It was a little looser than I felt comfortable with and a belt didn't help a whole lot.  The largest size isn't always the right size, as people often said in other comments/reviews.  It still fit well enough, just required adjusting and retucking of my shirt.<br /><br />The only defect I found was the eyelets for the belt strap are metal on one side, plastic on the other.  The plastic tends to pop out easily and then the metal eyelet will fall out."
4.0,"It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. You can get a compact, lipstick, small change purse and cell phone but that is about it. I would recommend for a teenager as they don't want much in their purse or a young girl. The color is right on being a deep mustard shade which is good for spring, summer and fall. The stitches are done well and the lining is secure being divided inside. Main part is of PU Leather which is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane which results in a product that is easier to clean and maintain .This item was just on sale but no extra discount given for reviewing."
4.0,Good pair of glasses for the price.
4.0,Dress is cute very clingy and slightly see through...bought the light pink.
4.0,The socks seem to be made of great quality the only issue that I had is the ran small. They were very tight on my feet. I bought them for camp since our theme was spider man. I'm a size 9 in Womens and ended up having to take them off bc they were so tight.
4.0,"Nice color. The lens are mirrored on the inside and out it seems. I see rainbows 🌈 when there aren’t any, everywhere. Is that just a me problem, or does anyone else experience the beautiful life effect of rainbows when wearable this mirrored sunglasses?"
4.0,Product is as I spected!
4.0,"The jacket is great for not-too-cold rainy day weather. The hood is nice and big, and the jacket is a nice midi type length. - Not too long and not too short. The pockets are conveniently placed, and the the style is very nice on.<br /><br />I should not have sized up. It tents on me, so stick with your usual size.<br /><br />Nice looking jacket."
4.0,The person I bought it for loves it however it is VERY see threw so she wears a long sleeve or tank top under it.
4.0,"After reading how small this tights might be, I was a little scared. But I didn't have any problems with it. I'm 5'3 and 142 lbs, it fit me just fine. I bought the coffee color, it's exactly what I was looking for."
4.0,Nice... good balance price for quality. The rose golden color is nice. Box is not elegant but its cute for a present
4.0,"I liked it a lot, but it was just a bit too tight for me.  If I had the time for this dresses purpose, I would have reordered in a larger size."
4.0,This pendent  came as shown.
4.0,They are sort of like a bathing suit material so if you get a size larger than what you normally wear the colors will stay true and bright. Otherwise the print stretches out and you lose some of the vibrancy.
4.0,My grandson loves the flip flop. It's well made and comfortable. It is slightly too big.
4.0,"I took a chance on this dress for Valentines weekend and I'm honestly not disappointed. It's a good length for me, just a bit above the knees (I am 5'6ish) and the material honestly isn't bad. It's not see through and the bra line in the front isn't too low. It's definitely more of a deep red than is shown, not deep lipstick red but more of a nice dark red. The dress is also long enough that I don't really worry about it riding up. It seems like it'll last a while since the material is a little bit better but I can't say for sure since I got it today. There is a little bit of fraying on some of the lace, not badly like cheap lace but just like a small piece here or there on the edges. I only knock it down a star because the arms a just a little bit short, not short enough to be a real problem but enough to bug me a little bit. Also, don't buy if you are a over a pant size 18, I'm an 18 (I ordered a XXL) and yes it fit, but if I gain any more weight it would look not so good and be too snug. It is a pretty snug fitting but it did follow the size chart posted so I won't knock it down for that. Overall for the price, I would say it was a decent buy. I would buy another in a different color."
4.0,Very beautiful but very heavy as well
4.0,Felt just like original Birkenstock’s
4.0,"HEAVY, with good functionality."
4.0,"I think the picture in the add is crips, the one I got was a bit more dull. But the image is as described. It arrived before the date indicated. Glad I could find it, Amazon has is all."
4.0,"I have a semi-formal/casual wedding to go to and needed something appropriate to wear. This dress fits my needs and my budget.<br />1. The color is much brighter in person (think that trendy coral color that was all the rage not long ago) than it looks on my screen (which is more a soft pink than orangey coral). I’m fine with it as it still looks good with my skin tone.<br />2. It has a few loose threads from the lace pattern but no huge snags. I like the built in slip as well. Feels like good quality for the price.<br />3. Looks MUCH better with a belt around the waist. I imagine a petticoat to flare out the skirt would make it look better as well.<br />4. It’s not skin tight and hits just above my knee. I’m 5’5” and 108lbs and ordered the small. I would have preferred the waist area to be tighter fitting personally, but it would be inaccurate to say it’s too big."
4.0,I thought it would fit over my DD’s but it doesn’t but it’s cute material and nice for a belly shirt
4.0,Its very simple to use and set up.  The only downside for me is that the band could be a bit longer.
4.0,Wrinkles real bad when you wash. I tried the gray one first and maybe I’ll wash by hand and soak in fabric softener maybe that’ll help with the wrinkles. I would recommend these. I really like the look under my tea shirts since work requires a collar lol
4.0,"Love this shirt.... fits perfect, not too tight or too loose. I noticed after washing a few times the knot has loosened a bit, but other than that it's one of my favorite shirts."
4.0,I like unique things and this caught my eye so I decided to purchase it i am happy with the purchase.
4.0,"These Aukivon Men's Tag-Free Briefs are very well made and seem designed to last; their thick, porous, breathable and absorptive material is extremely soft and comfortable. The waistband and leg holes stretch enough to assure a good fit, and the all-important pouch is adequately sized and shaped to do its job. YMMV, of course.<br /><br />I ordered them in Medium, which the size chart says fits waists from 33 to 35 inches, so I figured my 34-inch waist would be right in the sweet spot. But they’re actually a little bigger and have a looser fit than I prefer.<br /><br />They’re also a bit too “high-profile” for my taste. I’m more of a low-rider, bikini-style kinda guy, and these don’t ride as low on the hips as the product photos imply. The waistband comes nearly up to my navel, which creates a stodgy vibe of which I’m not all that fond.<br /><br />All in all, I rate these briefs at four stars; they’re extremely soft, comfortable and well made, but even the smallest size available is a little loose on me, and their high-profile coverage is more than I prefer. They’ll serve admirably for everyday use, though."
4.0,"I am 5'11"", 170 ish, usually wear a large but love a bit of room. LOVE the RED, it was actually RED. Wanted more of a 70's slash 80's cotton fleece (smooth on outside fluffy warm on inside) and got 2020 smooth cotton inside and out but it is surprisingly nice, thick and we will see how it wears.  I will wash it a few times before I buy more colors but it is VERY promising!!!"
4.0,"Although this is a great wig and color is amazing, the part is unnatural and the curls are too, I have yet to try and put heat on it."
4.0,Nice. Buy a size up. good dress for work.
4.0,Be sure the button or snap on your shorts is very secure.
4.0,"This is an adorable and figure flattering dress, but the light fabric of the yellow dress is quite see-through. I'm sure this could all be solved by wearing a full dress slip but instead of buying a slip, I decided to return it. I do recommend this dress for the style and fit, but only consider the lighter colored fabric if you have a full slip to wear with it. As far as sizing, I ordered a medium (my usual size) and found it a hair big but the tie in the back allows you to make it a bit tighter (I'm 5'8&#34; and an athletic 155 lbs)."
4.0,"Cotton shorts, so don't expect them to be stretchy. And the sizing is wonky. I usually wear an XL or XXL, because I don't like tight clothes, and my legs are a little heavy. But with these I guessed ""3X Asian, M US,"" which turned out to be perfect. They are smaller than a US 3X, but definitely bigger than a Medium. The waist band is bulky, but I'm wearing them with an untucked tank top, so it doesn't really matter. I just wanted something comfortable to wear around the house and for gardening. I like them."
4.0,I got these sunglasses because of increasing trouble seeing at night while driving and in bright glaring sunlight. They seem to work better than dark lenses. The frames are flattering and sturdy. My only complaint is they aren’t large enough to fit comfortably over my prescription glasses. Different shape profiles would be great.
4.0,I brought these back in 2016 and still have them. They are a little too loose but I really like the color and style of these. I have them for five years now and still get plenty of use out of them. I'm glad I got them.
4.0,"purple color is darker, the size fits very well!"
4.0,These slippers are very comfortable.<br />They fit perfectly and do not slap in the back like other slippers.<br />The insides are very warm and soft<br />The hard soles are great if you need to step outside. They are also good if you walk in water.<br />Overall I like these slippers a lot. They are a great value.
4.0,"It was a little big, but that was on my part. I love the quality of everything, its gorgeous."
4.0,Would be 5 stars if this dress wasn't so hard to get on..other then that I love love this dress..im 5'1 219 42G an I got a LG I think.. fits me like a glove even hold my very heavy twins in pretty good no bra.. dress has sum give not a lot..
4.0,I am happy with this outfit.
4.0,Held up great on airplane and has plenty of room!
4.0,Wish they were a little bigger.
4.0,"I really liked it, but just this, I’m 5”2 165lb<br />XL was too large for me<br />I would try Medium or large."
4.0,Good for prize box.
4.0,"I wear a size 14 at 5'4&#34; tall. The largest size, which is supposed to be a US 18, fit me perfectly. The color is nice and the poncho itself is flattering and hides figure flaws. I only wish that the material was thicker and of better quality, and that it came in more colors."
4.0,"You get what you pay for, but I do wish they were a tiny bit warmer/better quality. But for a stash of mittens for kids who lose them sometimes daily, this was a great deal."
4.0,It showed a free cover for the watch and I bought two bands and received no watch covers.  Talk about marketing ploys...hmmm
4.0,Were a gift for a granddaughter.
4.0,looks like a fit bit.
4.0,110vac adapter to 12vdc cig lighter. Works. What else can you say
4.0,"It fits my size 9 perfectly. Print is crisp and clean, nice package. Only down side is that the print is only on the front the bottom/back is all white. Which it was all printed."
4.0,Fabric is thin! Perfect for summer heat
4.0,Pretty and good fit
4.0,"Looks great! A little loose thread, but nothing some scissors didn't fix"
4.0,"I like the case, it’s pretty and I like that. The cleaning cloth that came with it works really well! The one downside is it’s a little small. I would recommend this product."
4.0,bright blue color. larger in size than expected but worked. Can easily become misshapened and hasn’t bounced back but my daughter still loves it.
4.0,"Run small, the shirt look great just ran a little small I would get a bigger size at least one up. But looks sharp. Great deal for the price you'd pay twenty bucks a hat at the store."
4.0,Looks great but a little hard to put on
4.0,This is adorable and stretches nice in order to fit smaller and larger wrists.
4.0,"- very large, but pretty<br />- returned"
4.0,Didn’t think some pieces would be melted
4.0,"DON'T EXPECT TO SEE WELL AT ALL DISTANCES. PROPERLY SET, YOU WILL SEE EXTREMLY WELL AT THAT DISTANCE. THE NOSE PIECE IS ACCEPTIBLE BUT NOT GOOD. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER EYE PROBLEMS, YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH THIS.<br /><br />RICHARD DODSON ."
4.0,Ties in back shaped the waist well. Had to use tape to keep front top part up.
4.0,"My husband usually wears an XXL in older Russell sweat shirts. This newer version in the XXL was HUGE. I sent it back and re-ordered it in a size large. The shoulders are large in the large but around the middle it is a bit snug. He is not a young ""wedge"" shaped man body shape. He has a protruding tummy and although this Large sweatshirt fit, it is tight in the middle. Fabric is nice, washed in hot water and put in dryer and shrinkage was minimal."
4.0,Hubby wanted something other than sports hats and he likes it so we're good!
4.0,"While they came a little late, I was surprised at the overall quality of the masks. I have a small face and have a hard time finding masks that fit, but the adjustable earloop option makes them work just fine. The sequins do not hamper your breathing either, and with the material on the inside you do not feel them against your face. The sizing varied on some of them, but overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and look forward to adding a little sparkle to my day while wearing these to work."
4.0,It's so pretty and shiny! I'm a size 8 it fits well.
4.0,Color of the chain is Turning silver
4.0,"Work well for a good price.  I did not realize “anti-glare” meant a yellow tint to the lenses but, now that I have them, the photo is accurate."
4.0,I decided to go up a size due to the Chinese sizing. Should have ordered the xl instead of the XXL. Great shorts though.
4.0,So cute except it's a bit see through:/ I got the pink ones so I don't know how the other colors are
4.0,Very cute but ran small.
4.0,Very nice shoes. My granddaughter loves them
4.0,Look great and feel good when you wear them
4.0,"Very beautiful fabric! Unfortunately runs way small - I ordered up one size and it is still too tight over the shoulders and doesn't come together in front by several inches, especially over chest and hips."
4.0,Its cute. I got it for my daughter for her birthday.
4.0,This thing is so cute!! Ir broke after 2 weeks though... had to super glue it back together
4.0,I bough this bag for my 17.3 inch laptop. Laptop fits in it and also there is enough room to keep charger and Ipad. It has one pocket on side to keep water bottle. I was little bit disappointed as there is no side pocket on the other side. It has a provision to keep this bag on trolley and can be carried sideways. Laptop gets enough padding to support from hard surfaces.
4.0,"The spider is much bigger than the picture indicates, so I probably will only wear it for fun at Halloween, nit all year around,  but it's fun and cute."
4.0,Like the feel and stretch of the bands.  Colors are what was expected.  Bands were larger than expected.  Still fit but wearing them on the last few holes
4.0,"I gave it as a gift ,and he loved it."
4.0,i like overall of this product but hanging mark on the shoulder.<br />this product whould have been hung by the hanger and left hanging mark on the shoulder which looks ugly.
4.0,Great sunglasses for a very reasonable price. The quality is what you would expect. The lenses are terrific for extremely bright areas. These work extremely well in the desert.
4.0,beautiful  and modest  loved it  returned only bc 15 yo girl wanted something more &#34;modern&#34;
4.0,Nice fabic and fit. Belt is above my waist but fits nicely.
4.0,"The dress fits as expected. (5'2&#34;, 146 lbs, got size 10). Its pretty and stretchy, and the waist and length are great. The dress was deeply wrinkled when it came. I put it in the drier with a dsmp cloth and tbe wrinkles came out without ironing. I wased it in the machine though it says not to. I'm letting it hang dry. Its wrinkly,  i hope the wrinkles fall out.<br />Update***i put the dress in the dryer to get the wrinkles out, and it looks great. But smaller."
4.0,"Thermoplastic is a little tricky, and the fangs need to be filed down. After my battle, & burns with the thermos I opted for denture fixidant. Works great!"
4.0,"Awesome skirt, exactly what was pictured, the only draw back was it was a bit larger than expected. I knew it would be a tiny bit big, as they don't make my size, but this was about 1-1.5 inches larger than what the chart said."
4.0,Material is a little thin but it fits nice.  Quality isn’t bad.
4.0,Cute and decently made.
4.0,Range of sizes doesn't offer an exact fit if you are size 10 1/2. You get either a little too small or too big. Otherwise the slipper itself is fine.
4.0,Nice. not too thin. Very pretty colors.
4.0,It looks great and fits well
4.0,"My husband loves this watch, very nice!"
4.0,Fits normal sized glasses-nothing bigger. I love the duo case though
4.0,"Appear to be solidly knit.  I cut them in half to make 4 sleeves  8 inches long. More than adequate to cover my fore-arms. A little heavy for hot weather, but good for  Spring & Fall."
4.0,"I did not expect this to fit like a crop top. I really love it though so I'm not disappointed. If you have a belly that you want to hide, this is not the top for you. I don't care if my roll shows though so I rock this top!! And, I encourage all you women to rock your rolls :)"
4.0,Gorgeous but a little tighter than I expected sometimes my feet hurt if I wear them too long. If you are between a 6.5-7 like me go up to the 7.
4.0,"Love this shirt, I work on a pizza truck and it’s super fun the fabric is a little stiff but tones down a bit after washing"
4.0,Very cute top. It fits well and made well. It’s lightweight. The buttons on the back are very cute. It stretches well. Flattering look.
4.0,"I got this dress to wear for my niece’s quinceñera. I’m usually a size M or 10 but occasionally a 12 so I ordered a 12 in this based on other reviews. I’m petite at 5’1” so this dress was definitely long. I was looking for something formal that I could also nurse in and options were limited. The top part was a bit loose so I definitely had to take it to be hemmed and adjusted. I had the tailor make the top part just fitted enough to wear I could pull the sleeve down to nurse and it worked great, of course nursing under a nursing cover lol. I wore 2 in heels once it was hemmed and it was perfect then. Great dress for the price. I had to spend a little more to get it fixed but it looked flattering and definitely from a high end store. My size is 38-31-39. The skirt is lined so you can’t see through it which is great."
4.0,"As with all Helkion stuff, the quality is terrific. Length is good, equivalent to a 34 inch inseam. The Large waist is a about a 36- meaning if you're looking for UP TO a 36&#34; waist, this will fit you, with ability to go down to maybe a 33&#34; with the built in side straps. Material is pretty thick and will definitely stand up to some abuse. Only mild complaint is the with the material being full nylon with no stretch, the crotch is slightly low/long and can be a touch binding. Overall, great purchase."
4.0,"This was purchased as a gift, it looked nice wont know how it holds up was repackaged and shipped to recipient"
4.0,Nice colors<br />Prompt delivery
4.0,"I’ve had nicer waffle knits. This one is really thin, cheap feeling, and rough but not scratchy. It’s described as a sweater but this top does not protect against cool weather at all! Needless to say I was disappointed when I got it.<br />So why the 4 ⭐️?<br />The cranberry red color is gorgeous and flattering for many skin tones. I’m 5’3, 137lbs, 36C, rectangular shaped, womens S/M. This top is TTS. I went with a S and like that it isn’t as slouchy as in the promo pic; however if u want that look just size up. The top is also surprisingly comfortable and flattering on. I even chose to wear this top in our family photos and I feel like it photographed beautifully and gave me a nice shape. This top will never be a favorite but it was a surprising hit. Oh and if u have a longer torso be aware that the front might be too cropped on u unless u size up."
4.0,"I liked the pants, but too small for my kid."
4.0,This is so beautiful<br />I am a 9 and it fits perfect with no extra space left. If you want it a little spacious order a size half up or a full size up.<br />I love these. They are so pretty
4.0,"Very cute, fit true to size, but the fabric is a bit chintzy. Definitely a hand wash item. But it is adorable over skinny jeans or leggings and the belt is a nice compliment."
4.0,Much heavier that it looks.
4.0,"I bought this for my Mom for Christmas this year.  When it arrived, I was scared as I've never purchased jewelry online before, and don't know much about women's jewelry, so the bracelet looked small when it arrived (length.)  But after lot's of internet research and asking around, this is a standard size for women's tennis bracelets.<br /><br />It's so beautiful and classy and elegant, but can be worn anytime (which is what I wanted.)  The emeralds are real, thus are imperfect and have some cloudiness and such to them which is unique.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with this item, and my mom LOVED it!  And it fit perfectly."
4.0,Like it and the print is super cute it just doesn’t suck you in as much as some leggings. But for the price they’re really good quality
4.0,This is a great dress - it seems very well made and the mid-weight jersey material is perfect for spring and summer.  The fabric feels like it will be very durable.  The only complaint my daughter has is the lack of pockets.  I myself am constantly perplexed why it's so hard to find girls clothing with pockets.  If it wasn't for that oversite this dress would rate 5 stars.
4.0,"cute, but a bit tight and don't feel like cotton"
4.0,Works well for all of my purses
4.0,Have not worn but fits over my Uniqlo travel jacket so believe I will use it often
4.0,Cute and silky.
4.0,Nice practice skirt
4.0,"Durable and easy to operate. The tin they came in is great for carrying my headphones, charging cable, and OTG adapter."
4.0,I bought this for a halloween costume so for that it was perfect but I don't think I would wear it anywhere else.<br />I am 5'3 and 155 Lbs and wear a 34 DD and I bought a medium knowing I wanted it to be a little tight but I probably should have bought the large. It is a touch too tight. If I don't have shapewear on underneath This dress then my stomach shows in weird places.<br />Also. The material is thick but the white is see through. And I cannot pull off the no bra look.<br />4 stars because it is see through. I haven't worn it out yet so I'll update after that.
4.0,The dress was. Hit. Received many complements. Loved the way it looked. I am only sorry that the sizes are not true sizes. Even if you measure carefully.  I ordered XL AND XXL. The  XL should have fit because I am a size 12.  It did not even come close. The XXL fit but the bodice was a bit too large.
4.0,"A little less substantial than I expected, but it is very comfortable, and has a little more classy look than a baseball cap. I use it when driving."
4.0,"They are a little bit smaller than I was anticipating, but otherwise, they're great and really fun!"
4.0,"I'm personally not sure about the high waist-ed bottoms, they look cute from the front but look a little bit like a diaper from the back. Not sure what could have been done to change that but honestly was sold on just the top anyway which is amazing and a great compromise between dumpy grandma bathing suit and &#34;I leave nothing to be imagined&#34; skimpy bikini. Fun, young and yet modest."
4.0,"This t-shirt is so cute! I loved th Mickey print and the durability of the fabric. It looks good, not cheap at all."
4.0,Yes its worth for what you pay
4.0,"I absolutely love this jacket! It's pretty cheap material, but hey, it was around 20$, so you get what you pay for! I'll totally reorder when it gets worn out in a month or two."
4.0,"This was a beautiful dress, a little plain, but overall beautiful fit and color. I just ordered a rhinestone belt/ribbon to give it a more fancy look. It fit as expected, and I was overall please with it."
4.0,Its cute but id definitely recommend getting a size bigger. Its a little tight
4.0,The material was smoother than I expected.
4.0,"Great gift for a 40th bday! This T-shirt for my husband perfectly. A true Large. Good quality, soft material. Would recommend!"
4.0,Vibrant colors. Kinda small around bust line
4.0,Nice quality earrings.  Only complaint is the gold is only on one side.
4.0,"I got this for a costume, and it fits great.  I typically wear a 6, and ordered this in a large.  I probably could have gone for a medium, but I was afraid that would be tight in a few spots.  The length is good.  I'm 5'10 and it hits above my ankles.  For my use that is perfect, and I may even modify it to have an under skirt show.  The neck / tie area is a little awkward.  It looks kind of weird tied, so I may leave it untied, or even take out the drawstring and sew it up a bit.  The fabric is not see through (I bought wine red) and it's a nice dark red color.  I would order this again if I wanted a different color."
4.0,lots of plastic pieces
4.0,These were a gift and the person that received them really liked them.
4.0,Material is nice but a little on the heavy side. It fits well and is as described but runs a little small.
4.0,"Bought for my wife. It’s a little tight across the belly and is too small through the chest for her. It’s adorable, but if you have large splayed breasts, it probably won’t cover you. Still keeping it, maybe I’ll convince her one day."
4.0,The jersey came on time as fits as advertised. My son (and wife who is the Yankees fan) love it. FYI the Yankees emblem is sown on. The number and name is not. With that said the jersey is great. Good quality for the price. Very happy.
4.0,Fits like I expected
4.0,"The dress looks exactly like I hoped it would. Very cute and fits my almost 3yr old perfectly. The neckline is great, there are other dresses out there where the neckline is gaping. I love the green color for the skirt and the rustic deer and leaves are all perfect. She doesn't like how the waist band of the skirt feels against her skin on her stomach so we have to include an undershirt. Not a big deal to me, but might make it uncomfortable for some kids."
4.0,"Not quite as warm as I hoped.  Love the easy on, easy off the zippers provide"
4.0,"came quickly and very cute, washed well!"
4.0,Bought one size up because webpage stated that item was cut small. Have room to gain weight if needed
4.0,"Absolutely love this dress! Beautiful red color, very vintage. I am of the larger persuasion so I ordered a 2X. The armpit area looked a little ill fitting but nothing a good old cardigan can't fix. The bust was also a little odd but not too bad. I haven't thrown it in the wash yet but I hope it turns out alright! Also, shipping from China, it came a lot sooner than expected so I'm happy all around!<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"I bought my first Glo Bag 2 years ago.  I used it 3-4x per week on average, and recently one of the metal reinforcing rods started wearing through the fabric, so I decided to replace it.  The first new bag I received had a damaged zipper, and the company graciously allowed me to return it and I ordered another.  This one works okay, but I've noticed now the pockets on the outside are much shallower than they used to be, which doesn't work as well for me.<br />Overall a good concept and quality, although a bit disappointed in the outside pockets now."
4.0,"The earrings that came are bigger than I expected, so I don't use about half of them. However, the two smallest sizes I wear daily for almost 2 months now and have sees no green discoloring nor have they caused any irritation to my sensitive ears. I like them."
4.0,It worked for my Esmeralda costume!
4.0,"Really cute but I bought the one with the green fern leaves first, and loved it so much I bought this one in the same size. I can’t fit by boobs in this one. Not sure why the big discrepancy in sizing"
4.0,Fits well and super cute on my daughter!!
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is a nice blazer for the price.  It is fully lined and has pockets.  It is nice enough to wear to work but also pairs well with jeans.  The grey is a lovely shade, kind of a blueish-gray.<br /><br />However, the sizing is a little off.  I am 5'5"", 156 lbs and typically wear a size 10 in blazers.  I ordered the size large and it fits in the chest but is too snug in the hip/butt area."
4.0,Bottom of dress is to big
4.0,"Fashionable dress<br />I LOVE IT<br />The material is different than the picture<br />It is good quality and everything, it is just different than the picture<br />It is much lighter and needs to be ironed alot"
4.0,"quality US flags, a bit larger than expected, but very useful.  Quick shipping.  Many thanks"
4.0,Fits a little snug but it works
4.0,Very well made hat plus the hat design is cool
4.0,Sexy yet classy.  Fit a little small.<br />#14463#
4.0,"Nice piece of jewelry for the money, well worth it. I have had many compliments."
4.0,"The shoe looks fine, but lacks a bit of structure/rigidity. But hell... it was like $16. I can't complain."
4.0,"Its super helpful to have these if you don't want your ears pierced, but you gotta be mindful that they do irritate the ears a tad bit because of the magnet, and do fall out quicker than an earring with a stud."
4.0,i like the material and color but looks so different on me maybe cause of my height!
4.0,As per the reviews I purchased a half size larger.  I am very happy with the sandals because I keep it in my gym bag and wear in in the locker and shower area.  I wouldn't walk around with them all day.  They don't soak up any water and as a previous reviewer mentioned it is all one piece so I don't worry about pulling the top through the hole.
4.0,"It is a lovely top but the yellow is not as vibrant as shown in the photo, hence my 3 stars."
4.0,They were sorta smaller than I thought
4.0,"Waist band needs work and band not super comfortable but I love the look and the feel of the pants so I will redo the band myself.<br />I do love them and intend to keep them but buyer beware, as someone said before me the waist band has issues."
4.0,If you want a heavy duty shirt this is a good one.  I wanted something more like a regular flannel shirt.  Also I don't like the tabs and buttons at the hem.
4.0,I bought this belt as a gift for my husband. It took a while to ship to us but it was worth the wait. The belt seems to be high quality real leather but does not have the horrible leather smell. Its perfect to dress up with a suit or to wear with jeans. The belt came in a very nice tin case and even had tissue paper with the sellers name on it.  The only reason I gave this item 4 stars was because in my opinion the size ran a little small. My husband is a size 36 and I ordered a size 38 belt  which I am so glad I did because it barely fits.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,"I bought 2 of these shirts for my mother and I. Mine (a small) fit comfortably. Hers (a large) was a little snug. Regardless, they are comfortable for running, and wash well."
4.0,I got a large im 200 in curvy but i have a gut lol... a medium would be alittle sexier and in 5'3
4.0,It was exactly what I needed for my Kipling tote
4.0,Like the design from back too looks perfwct on me
4.0,"A bit wide, but very attractive for the price, and comfortable.  I would be loath to walk a long ways in them, but they are almost OK to wear &#34;out&#34;."
4.0,"somewhat cheap/thin but for the price exspected, cute in general"
4.0,pretty toe ring. a little too big for my toe but my daughter loves it!
4.0,BF liked it.
4.0,Very comfortable to wear. Long enough! But need to wear a slip underneath to avoid see through.
4.0,The dress is super cute esp for the price. I ordered a Large and it fit like a Medium. My daughter took the dress. If you order the dress you may want to size up.
4.0,Four stars only because it only came in one color and fushia doesn't go with everything...
4.0,I liked the creative item. Stone looks real.
4.0,Love the pendant.  Not so sure about the adjustable chain.  the two sides hang down awkwardly if you want to wear it shorter.  Probably wouldn't buy the adjustable chain again.
4.0,Love the bag just wish it was a little bigger.
4.0,I wear it all the time. It fits nicely on my ear and is a cute little cuff. The only thing is I have a habit of pushing my hair behind my ear and just about take it off every time.
4.0,its a little too small or snug. order a size up if possible.
4.0,If you are on the taller side this outfit won’t work. I ordered a medium and I’m 5”3 and it worked well but someone 5”10 or taller not so much.
4.0,Cute orange color. Works well.
4.0,"If you’re looking for a nice warm and cozy sweatshirt for Fall, this is the one! I love the lettering “be kind”! I’ve adopted that as my new motto lately, so I’m really loving it! I will say that this runs small. Be sure to order at least one size up - even then, it will likely still be a bit snug. This sweatshirt is so cute and would be a great gift for the holidays too."
4.0,The  sleeves are made out of a different materials and makes the feel and look a little off. Also the front of the shirt is way longer than the back
4.0,Decent quality. Took a month to get to the US from China. Ok for occasional wear.
4.0,"Love the lenses on these things, clear view and my favorite shade althought the frames are a bit flimsy but heck for the price they are just right. They look good too."
4.0,Ok. But to small
4.0,Just like the pic. Wife loves it.
4.0,I love these tank tops but they shrink quite a bit. They are also a little low cut and tend to ride down when i'm running and wear them with a non-cotton sports bra
4.0,Super cute! I would give 5 stars but is small. I would order  a size up.
4.0,"The nose is a little uneven and maybe damages, but all around a cute little bag."
4.0,I like the sock for sleeping.  I wish the material was more cottony.
4.0,"based on the reviews i knew this would be large on me, also I'm 5'4 average build girl so no matter what i figured a standard adult costume would be large on me, i got a lot of compliments wearing this, people were laughing and smiling all day. i did buy a fur boa at the craft store and use a glue gun to get the ears a little bigger and more fluffy, but i knew that would be the plan judging by how dinky they look in the picture. 4/5 only because it would be nice if the ears didn't need alteration to look right"
4.0,"If you get a size larger it will fir right, however I wish the polos were a little longer."
4.0,Loved it but I tightened it all the way and some how the top ball is missing so I’m sad :(
4.0,Wish I would have gotten a small instead of medium. It is a sexy dress and I received numerous compliments.
4.0,"Very cute! Not really wearable as a dress , but works great with shorts or a tight skirt, tie straps make it adjustable"
4.0,Good price but a lot larger then l thought they would be but if you like really large earrings they are pretty
4.0,These are very nice looking sunglasses. They are a little flimsy but you get what you pay for.
4.0,Gave this as a gift to someone who loves cats; and was thrilled.
4.0,"I will have to agree with others about the bulky area in the front, but these are still cute and fit true to size sort of- I’m eager to see how they do after a few washes."
4.0,"If you have a wide chest area, be sure to order 1 size larger than usual. Bought my boyfriend this for Christmas ended up buying a 3x and he normally wears just a XL. Stopped right at his waist and was a bit tight so not an everyday jacket to wear more so just for a photo or a Halloween costume<br />Quality was good!"
4.0,"It’s more silky than cotton. It also runs smaller than expected. The xxxl fits like a size 16.,"
4.0,"I'm 5'11 and ordered a size Extra Large. Perfectly long for a tall girl! The fabric is a tad thin,but it's great for a bathing suit coverup. I ordered it in the Coral color and plan on ordering it in darker colors."
4.0,They fit my fat head perfectly but the lenses are not red as depicted in the image. A good buy for someone who loses sunglasses often.
4.0,"I love this necklace. I am a fan of strands rather than pendants, and this necklace goes with everything. It is classy and really well crafted. Doesn't get caught in my hair or clothing fibre."
4.0,"nice fit. The brim folds up a little high, but I think I can work with it."
4.0,I like!!!!!!
4.0,I guess this is normal though? Makes sense that if you oil something it’ll become a dust magnet. Maybe this is normal maybe it didn’t absorb well. I used very little and buffed.
4.0,"Fit as expected, the bow was not that cute and cheaply made. But the rest of the outfit was incredible adorable and good. I did not use the shoes because my child's feet are a specific size. The back of the outfit is shorter than the front to show off the cute ruffle butt diaper cover. Very cute outfit.Gave four stars only because the bow was cheap and the shoes were one size fits all, but still a cute Halloween outfit."
4.0,"This dress runs a bit large. I’d say size down one size to get a really nice/sexier fit unless you are going for a looser fit. You can tell the dress is quality and the material is not cheap. It actually looks tailored in person. The dress itself is quite lovely. I normally don’t wear floral prints but picked this to try something new and to wear to a wedding. It is pretty but conservative and has a retro look to it. The colors on the dress really pop and are quite vibrant while the dress material is very soft.<br /><br />‘Personally’ I just didn’t like the look of the dress ‘on me’ as the size I selected was too loose fitting and it came off as matronly. However I still got many compliments on the dress from many people.<br /><br />Otherwise, the dress was shipped on time and the package presentation was quite nice. It is a very nice quality garment. I’d recommend ordering a size down from your actual size."
4.0,Pretty.  Thus far it has held up well.
4.0,"Very cute, but ordered a size 4 (not 4T) and it was too small for my normal sized 3 year old."
4.0,"Great curve loving fabric, just a bit too tight."
4.0,"The headbands are really soft and nice, lovey colors, just not to fussy about the knot in the middle."
4.0,"I really thought this was going to be the perfect suit as I love the top and the bottoms were high waisted, but sadly this fell short for me. I ordered a medium, but here are the issues: the top is super stretchy, you cannot adjust the front, just tie/re-tie the bow which is fine as I’m a bit busty and it still looked good however, the lapel color area just doesn’t lay right. In the picture the collar lays down like a typical shirt but in person it won’t lay down. It just folds inward towards your center chest and looks weird. I tried smooshing it down, it won’t stay.. sure I could use safety pins but who wants safety pins on their bathing suit?  So onto the bottoms, snug but good fit however the leg openings are so crazy tight on your thighs! This is such an odd fit because the rest of the suit fitting wise is fine. I don’t have skinny thighs, I’m curvy but never have an issue with any suits in the leg areas. Such a cute design, but due to the odd flaws at least on the one I received, it’s a no-go for me, I’ll see if my 20 yr old daughter can make a better fit of it.<br /><br />*****UPDATE**** so my daughter fits the suit, she’s 5’2, 138 lbs, thigh isn’t an issue for her but the top still same issue so I added 1 star"
4.0,These work well to wrap around rolls of wrapping.  Could be just a smidge longer when using on larger rolls.
4.0,"It is a little small, but it does the job!  I like it better than using toothpicks to keep the clasp open"
4.0,"It is a very warm sweater,I like the fit."
4.0,"My daughter finds these comfortable and the non-skid surface is good. However, they are too short. The cuff slips down low on the back of her ankle just above her heel. That was before they were washed so I know they did not shrink."
4.0,Super cute belly button ring but DO NOT buy if you have a metal allergy. Usually my belly button isn't so sensitive to jewelry.. But I had a huge allergic reaction.
4.0,For the price of course this isn't heavy duty. Very light weight.
4.0,"I've bought a few shorts/compression combo and these were good.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Phone pocket was plenty big<br />- Size was as expected, which sometimes compression shorts can be tricky<br />- Other pocket was nice to have<br />- Colors were awesome. Bright and stood out, which is the main reason I picked these over others<br /><br />CONS<br />- These sometimes feel uncomfortable around the crotch. After moving around enough it gets better but it's still an issue. I have fat thighs even though I'm not too fat so maybe that's an issue<br /><br />Still, overall I'd buy these again if I there was a really good deal or something. The con wasn't that bad."
4.0,"The polo shirts are good quantity, sizing seemed accurate. I would purchase them again."
4.0,"Fits very well. A little tight around the chest, but overall very nice dress."
4.0,"Only problem was that it had a missing stone. Else, it's a beautiful piece and fits nicely on the left ear. I'd say good price too. Had to return though since its damaged before even worn. I still gave it a high star rating only cause if I order another piece, hopefully would be in full stones and wont have that problem. As of now, it's not available anymore. I guess I ordered the last available piece."
4.0,"At $9.98, it certainly was value for money. If we had more choices, we certainly wouldn't have settled for a silicone strap replacement. Unfortunately, my wife's 15-year old, 21mm lug size Pop Swatch isn't terribly common nowadays and Swatch themselves aren't even supporting the range, let alone 3rd party makers. To be able to get any replacement at all was therefore fortunate. So, given the prevailing realities, and at this price point, it's good enough."
4.0,This is an awesome gift! I bought it for my husband to put along with his set of dog tags... The chain that comes with this is definitely female so that will be changing obviously. The tag actually has a little bit of weight to it and looks like the words were carved out well. The packaging was a baggie inside of a felt bag and a plastic zipper bag so it was well taken care of :-)
4.0,Great quality! Keeps head warm. Only complaint is it says for kids but it is a bit big. I'd say its perfect for like 8+<br />I got them for my 4 year old but my 11 year old and I will be sharing them.
4.0,"Sizes dont match current glove sizes I own, too large, cant do anything in them except bend the tops of the gloves backwards as entertainment. December update, customer service got in contact with me and I asked to exchange for the next size down. Instead they just sent them and I recieved them in a decent time and fit is a lot better, I can answer the phone with them but texting is a little harder, cold weather wise around 10 degrees they seem to do the trick and kept my hands warm even after leaving them in a vehicle over night. If you want a set of warm gloves that aren't bulky and still have movement these would do the trick"
4.0,Great product but I have tiny wrist so I have to wear it at the smallest. It doesn't stay tight all day.
4.0,These pants fir amazing and are such a soft material! If you are looking for something to fit tightly then i would definitely size down.  I am 5'5 and 145lb and I got a medium but I think my next ones will be a small so that they are more slim fitting. They are definitely more a silky material like leggings.
4.0,"This doesn't carry much if you are carrying groceries or other supplies, but it works very well to tote around a couple of music folders, which is why I bought it.  I like having both types of straps, short and long."
4.0,"Soft fabric, not at all thin, cute styling."
4.0,"Very cute watch especially with certain outfits. Comes with the cute little bracelet to match the watch, I got the rose gold white one which I love the color. The only thing that’s weird about it is it comes with this little screw driver thing to adjust or clip on the watch but after reading the directions and messing with it, it’s fine."
4.0,Shirt runs kind of small. I'm usually a medium but ordered a large because of reviews I read. The large fits more like a medium but it fits great!
4.0,"I was really excited to see this watch at the price listed on Amazon, I'm not quite sure if it's a steam punk watch, but that's what I think it is and that's why I bought it. It's great for my ADD because I can watch the motors going round and round and round inside of the watch while I'm at work to distract me from not getting on my cell phone. LOL.  However having a wind up watch is work. And my memory is shot. So I forget to wind it and it doesn't mean oh good because I don't have the right time on it. I you have to at least wind it twice a day full wind at least that's how mine came. But I saw where cause I think it's super cool, and it keeps me off my cell phone and distracted at work. ⌚️🚫📱🏤"
4.0,"I wear head wraps and turbans a lot. Love the color patterns, however I can do without the mask buttons I cut them off."
4.0,Nicely made just wished it was a thicker more absorbent fabric. The polyester has a silk feel and I hope sauce doesn’t slide right off.
4.0,"(Mens dress shoes) - Almost perfect.<br /><br />I got new dress shoes, and within an hour, they were rubbing the back of my heels raw.<br /><br />I bough pads from both Walmart, as well as a chain shoe store. Both were only small pads for the top/back part of the shoe. Neither stayed in place. These, with the extra bottom of heel area, make all the difference in keeping them in place.<br /><br />For some reason, one pad didn't stick as well (on the heal area) as the other. This could very well have been an issue on my end, and is why I gave only 4 stars.<br /><br />I used a Qtip to dab a little crazy glue in a couple spots to keep it in place. The other pad is working just fine."
4.0,"I love the design, the shirt itself was a lot bluer in the picture. It's actually black which was kinda a let down but the vivid pink makes up for it"
4.0,"I am very happy with my purchase of this lingerie. It's very good quality for the price and feels great on. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the shorts are definitely more so very high cut bikini style underwear. I am 5'9&#34;, so not extraordinarily tall or anything. I still loved the way it looked and have no problem with it, but it's definitely different than as shown."
4.0,Cute but very thin. They spin around on my denim jacket.
4.0,Loved everything about them will buy more
4.0,"Good quality and looks good, my only gripe is that the blue is very dark, and is not immediately recognizeable as blue."
4.0,"i love how these fit to my face, they are reasonably comfortable for long periods of time, assuming a long time is reasonable party's length of a few hours.<br /><br />a word of caution for anyone who tends to wear glasses instead of contacts these cannot be worn with glasses.<br /><br />there are two things i did not like about them.<br />first and foremost, the glitter is completely exposed and flakes off somewhat easily, and as it is glitter, it gets everywhere.<br />second there is a point at the top of the blue mask where it curves back to meet the forehead and if you are like me and have a larger forehead, it has a tendency to poke your forehead when smiling laughing or talking in an animated way.<br />there is a third thing on specifically the black mask. on the blue one there is an elastic strap that holds it to your face, but on the black one, and although it is clearly shown in the pictures it has two ribbons that are to be tied. this can pose a problem for people with lots of hair or long hair as the hair can get caught up in the knot. as well as makes it not as easy to use. i much prefer the elastic strap to the ribbon knots and i may modify my mask to have an elastic strap instead to make it just as easy to use as the blue.<br /><br />if i were the maker of this product i would make the pointy bit at the top less pointy or not as tight to the face to better accommodate more face shapes. and put some kind of thin sealant or something to make it easier for the glitter to stay put."
4.0,"It's a good price and the quality isn't bad at all, I was happy with the product . I'm size medium and I ordered L it fits perfect"
4.0,"We really like them as an indoor shoe, bought two sizes larger than the twins are wearing thinking they would fit for a bit and have to wear them now as they are a perfect fit right now."
4.0,"Nice apron, a little plastic-y though. I’m not sure if it’s machine washable."
4.0,"A pretty good pouch that will hold 4 pairs of sunglasses. The pouch is made of very soft leather (black) and has a felt interior (gray), which is also very soft. I really like that I can place 4 pairs of sunglasses into something that is portable. This pouch contains 4 pockets; the pockets ensure that the felt is the only material that touches your glasses, preventing scratching.<br /><br />Although useful, I found several things I didn't like about this pouch. Here's my list of likes and dislikes:<br /><br />Like:<br />-- Made of 1 piece of leather, which means there's not chance of leather &#34;pieces&#34; separating<br />-- The sewing used to create the 4 pockets is concise and tight<br /><br />Dislike:<br />-- Fits smaller sunglasses only. I wear average size glasses but nearly every pair I have stretches the pockets quite a bit. In addition, one side of the sunglasses is consistently longer than where the crease (fold) is. When this pouch is rolled up, it is really bulky. Please see the picture to see what I mean.<br />-- There's only 1 tie strap. It would have been better with 2 ties (one on either side)<br />-- Edges of pouch are not sewn. There's a good chance that the leather and felt will separate after constant use. I plan on storing this pouch in my car (I switch between different types of sunglasses depending on how bright it is and whether or not it's overcast). I foresee that this pouch may roll around a little and start fraying at the edges. If the edges are sewn, they won't fray.<br /><br />Overall: I do like the pouch and it will be useful for its ability to hold multiple pairs. But there's definitely room for improvement. My biggest issue with this item is that it doesn't appear to accommodate average size sunglasses very well (and forget about any over sized glasses - especially those that are popular with the ladies). This is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />I hope you found this review useful.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this item at a substantial discount in exchange for a thorough and honest review. All observations and comments are my own. Please don't hesitate to leave your comments or to ask me questions."
4.0,I love the purse but look larger online.
4.0,"I did not expect it to be rigid.  Very good quality mask, but just slightly too-large."
4.0,I like the thumb slots to protect the backs of my hands.  Overall length seems a little short.... always sliding down below my elbow.  Otherwise I'm very satisfied.
4.0,Tight outlines just wish it was tight throughout
4.0,boots have zipper not shown in photos....ordered 9.5 but think company sent  a 10 in any case because they are winter boots i'll just wear thicker socks.
4.0,"This hat is super cute and amazing quality. This is such a great value, this hat would be so expensive where I'm from. The Pom Pom on my hat is a little long and wonky but it's not big deal it doesn't look too bad.

4.0,"The designs on these pajamas could not possible be more cute. Especially the pair that makes your child look like a pirate. However I would recommend purchasing a size larger than you really need or hang to dry. When we first tried them on they fit as expected, however they do shrink up a bit after washing. Colors are bold and do not seem to have faded after a few washes and my son loves them."
4.0,"I was happy to finally order a clothing item from china that actually fits. I can't wait to lounge by the pool at Disney World in this suit.<br />As many reviewers have said, the length is a little short, especially if you have a lot going on up top but I found if I tie the halter a bit tighter it fixes that issue.<br />It isnt super high quality, however. It arrived with a hole it in. Luckily it was just on a seam so I can repair that but still disappointing enough to warrant a odd of a star."
4.0,Looks just a little different as shown on picture. I like how the white looks on the picture but not so much shown on actual shirt.
4.0,"i hope it is the same  gloves I ordered<br />my neighbor told  me they were on my  TOP  DOOR  //// NOT THE BACKYARD DOOR AS<br /> ///REQUESTED ///// THE DMN  SAGA CONTINUES ////  I GUESS IT WILL NEVER END /////<br />THEY ARE UNABLE TO READ  THE INSTRUCTIONS, AND MIND YOU THEY ARE NOT UNDOCUMENTED  ALIENS,  THESE GUYS ARE MAKING $15 AN HOUR AND CAN NOT READ SO IT SEEMS.<br />I like these gloves better than the previous I had gotten"
4.0,I've always loved airplanes and as a former Flight Attendant it reminds me of the memories... I will Never Forget 9/11
4.0,"I like it ,but too small for me"
4.0,sexy and very surprised with the comfort zone and how easy it was to walk in them with such a unique style of the heel -very sturdy... that is IF you are used to wearing heels this high. Only issue is: a bit too many straps at the top of the ankle...they are difficult to buckle if you have long nails...other than that...I'm pretty happy with them.
4.0,The quality of the material was great and the shirts fit as well
4.0,I bought this too help identify my luggage when traveling and for security in case luggage is broken by rough airport baggage handlers when I don’t carry it onto plane.
4.0,"sturdy, compact, easy to take and use.  Keeps items cool for a short time so works great from store to home.  home to friends.  picnic lunches"
4.0,I love these earrings! But they were different than the picture! They had a long chain about an inch long. But you're able to double the chain into the clasp to wear them long or short.
4.0,"I really like it, but the plastic shield is thick and it is warm in Florida. I love that I can wear a cap with shield attached ! I’d buy again and gift it."
4.0,Didn't lay straight.  Had to bend/flex it to go to straight.
4.0,I just didn't like that you could see some of my bra on the side.
4.0,I gave 4 stars just because it pulls hairs on my arm. Other than that it is a good purchase. The color matches my 42mm rosegold watch and the magnetic clasp is strong enough to hold it in place. I could not rate the durability as I have only had it for a few weeks. The other thing I am not crazy about is that the pins come separate. It was a bit of a pain to put them in and you must be careful when removing because they will come right back out.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:164584c0744232cd4684404dbca0f2b4]]
4.0,"Very pretty and well made, and stays put when you swim or work out (I use for working out). Runs a tad bit small but otherwise is a wonderful top."
4.0,"I really like this top. It's very thin so you can layer if you want. But the fit just wasn't right. I'm 5'1&#34; and 130lbs and it fit me, but it Just fit. If I raise my arms my stomach would show and when I sit down it shifts up to expose my back and middle. I like my tops long enough to cover my butt. It's small enough that I'm giving it away to a young family member."
4.0,The in between toe material is a little hard for my taste but I am break them in. Shoe very comfortable for people who need support
4.0,Pretty pattern.Small but would be perfect if It had an extra pocket/zipper. Disappointing 7
4.0,Shorts appear to be of a good quality but even after following the size chart they run large. Had to exchange for a smaller size.
4.0,"I try really hard to read all sizing info and to comb through all reviews and pics to help me decide if something will work for me and in what size.  I tried this in XL, returned it and then tried it in L... and it was still too big.  Look I'm short and almost 200lbs  (this is new territory for me), and this dress was still way too big to be flattering on me.  I almost want to try it again in a smaller size, but I'm gonna leave it alone.  It was kind of cute, but not cute enough that I'd actually wear it comfortably.  Maybe it was just the wrong style for me?  I really did want to like it, but oh well.  I will say that returns were super easy with this- both times.  no questions asked, no problems."
4.0,"Pretty colors, great price too !!!"
4.0,"These pants are very soft and similar the very expensive Barefoot Dreams. However, they are thinner, very long and the elastic in the waist twists around and is very annoying. The colors are almost a perfect match and they are half the price but I think I will be saving up for the real thing so they will last. The price of these is nothing to sneeze at and I do t think they are quite worth the price.  The cardigans are better."
4.0,I have a bad habit of pulling earring backs off.  These stay on better than metal ones (not metal locking ones) and I bought enough that I always have extra if I happen to lose one.
4.0,"Love the color of the dress, but I  believe it's not true to size. If you decide to purchase it just go up a size and you will love it."
4.0,Beautiful coat.
4.0,Like the leaf but chain is really cheap looking.  Bought it to replace one that I had bought at H&M and wore frequently and my daughter had broken.  Put the leaf on the old chain.  It also is a much shorter length on the chain than the picture description.
4.0,Haven’t worn it yet. I have to have links removed.
4.0,"This winter I was driving an hour from Orange County to Burbank, Interstate 5 the whole way, looking directly into oncoming headlights.  Much of the 5 is either decrepid or under construction.  It requires close attention and good vision in many areas.  Oncoming headlights made the drive very difficult until I purchased the night driving glasses. They made a big, big difference.  This is the only brand I have tired, so I cannot compare them against any other brand, thus I could only give a four star rating. I plan to purchase several more pair."
4.0,I like this bag; it is exactly as described.  It is especially good for the reasonable price.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the color is more of a brown than a burgundy.
4.0,"This shirt is super soft, fits well and as expected (I sized up because I am tall and needed the length to wear with leggings), and I think it's going to be one of my favorites! However, I ordered Navy, expecting navy, but what I got isn't going to work like I had hoped because it's not a true Navy. It is more like a grey-indigo. (See photos - one is with flash and one is without). I will be ordering more colors, but I would say their Navy is not navy, so if you need a very specific color, choose carefully."
4.0,Very cute.  Just what I wanted!
4.0,"It fits well and is pretty comfortable.  My daughter has already ""borrowed"" it and I don't think I'm getting it back. I would buy another."
4.0,I was so worried ordering this dress as there weren't any photos for the reviews on the long sleeved white dress. I was looking for a lace long sleeved dress for our Valentines Day winter elopement but was really not wanting to spend hundreds or even thousands on a dress I'll have on for only an hour. This dress was everything I wanted and thanks to an Amazon gift card I had laying around it was less than $100. The lace is a tab bit itchy but like I said it will only be on for an hour so its something I can put up with. I will update with photos after our wedding but please don't wait BUY THIS DRESS!
4.0,Really tight. Good thick material. It's actually surprisingly warm. I was pleasantly surprised.
4.0,The only thing is they were too big and slippery on the bottom. They gave me a blister on the outside of one of my feet from the first 30 minutes of wearing them. But I really like them!!!
4.0,Very nice material. Thin enough for hit summers yet full coverage. ❤
4.0,"The top is very weird its too tightly sewn, but otherwise super cute."
4.0,It’s great sunglasses 😍
4.0,My son’s favorite shirt! Very cool design. If anything it maybe runs slightly small but just don’t throw it in the dryer!
4.0,This is a nice and easy accessory to throw on - on its own it looks a little cheap but does look much better on
4.0,"The sweatshirts are what I expected. The fit is just right for me. The material is soft and the color selection is great. The only issue I have is the 1 inch square Russel (R) tag that is sewn in the lower front right side of the sweatshirt.  The tag stands out too much and detracts from the clean look of the sweatshirt.  I removed the tag, even though it is not easy."
4.0,I liked it but I’m a little overweight so it does make me look more chubby but NOT with a thin sweater or open top
4.0,Can be longer
4.0,Lacing is uneven.
4.0,it was a big pricey. But it looks very nice.
4.0,"The shirt fit perfectly. The dark blue embroidery of the Air Force and logo is hard to see. That is the only drawback. Great item for the price. Air Force, Fly, Fight, Win!"
4.0,"So pretty. While the materials for busy area could be improved some, the overall feel and look is very classy and pretty."
4.0,The stem is a little to long so it touches the other side of my nose. Other than that its great!
4.0,"Very comfortable, the size is perfect and they’re a great length but they’re a little thin so if you’re worried about someone seeing your bum when you bend them I’d suggest wearing them with a longer shirt."
4.0,Wish they bent a little in towards the face. But overall they are nice glasses
4.0,Just what I wanted. Looks like real fur. Easy to attach.
4.0,really cute . a little tight on arms but im battling the big arm syndrome now . the length is perfect for a cropped sweater and perfect for layering
4.0,"This is an average face mask. It washes good and looks fine after washing. I was glad I could choose a light grey instead of black because of it being so hot this summer. I would like the part that fits around the ear to be thinner, but it's okay the way it is. The price was good for a package of 5."
4.0,Fit was smaller than the brown hat I had previously purchased but I still like it.
4.0,"I like it. It’s cute. The white band is LOUD, but it’s definitely a statement. The rose gold color is everything though!"
4.0,"This is a nice twist on briefs, much better than the old ""tighty whities"" that we grew up with! They come in fun colors and are well designed to fit comfortably. The fabric breathes well, though I'm highly doubtful that it's actually 95% cotton & 5% polyester, feels much more like the other way around (which isn't even a bad thing, tech/wicking materials make great underwear). They also run a bit large, I ordered L due to a little pandemic weight gain but we're either going to have to gain a little more weight or size down to an M."
4.0,Cute necklace for $4
4.0,"OK, hard to evaluate.  This belt looks great!  However,  It is about 1&#34;+3/8&#34; wide; so it does not fit well in the loops of most of my jeans.  But I really want to use this belt because it seems so durable.  It is almost 3/16&#34; thick leather, while most of my belts are only half as thick."
4.0,Little tight but wearable
4.0,Nice dress. Too small.
4.0,"I ordered the red in M, but tag says XXL.  My usual size is an 8 or medium in tops and jackets, and this fits a little bigger than expected.  Should have ordered S, but with the 3-4 weeks for delivery it's not worth the return time."
4.0,"These are fantastic glasses if you're looking for something with an aviator style that has a bit more funk to it. These glasses are much bigger on my face and I thought they were going to be, however I ended up really loving the fan as it grew on me. The glasses are Matt black on all of the metal, and have that diamond shape cut out around the actual lenses. The lenses are much more clear than I anticipated them being. The lenses give a really weird effect to everything that I look at but I love it. When looking out the window of my car everything has a rainbow or iridescent effect to it, and all the screens like my GPS or cell phone have a blue tint to them. The glasses are not at all gray when you look for the lenses is definitely a blue sort of lens.<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me about the classes when they arrived is they are made to fit stick straight across your face. I didn't particularly feel comfortable with that, so I bent the classes in word a little bit to make them curve around my face slightly. I also curved the side pieces that hold on to your ears in word because it was a little big for my face. The metal is hard to bend so if you choose to do this like I did try to be very careful and ove with caution so you don't snap them.<br /><br />Review by P.

4.0,"BEAUTIFUL, BUT SHOE STARTED COMING APART AFTER WEARING A FEW TIMES."
4.0,"The elastic shoe laces where very colorful.  I bought them to put on my son's shoes because he can never tie his shoes right to where they won't be dragging the ground or coming untied.  This was very helpful with these.  However, I did find them a bit confusing on how to put together.  I would suggest a instruction sheet be put in the package with the laces.  Once I figured it out they work wonderfully."
4.0,I ordered xl little to big for me
4.0,"Pretty dress, nice material!"
4.0,Great quality product with a amazing price made front a great material with strong zippers tuh At will not break easy. Very nice weekend bag with plenty of space for clothes you'll need I've used this for plenty of Vegas trips and she's held up with style. The strap is very nice and  sturdy which is really nice the bank has two zippers on each side I can extend to make it bigger or collapse make a small great feature
4.0,Very nice but too long
4.0,This dress exceeded my expectations! It’s really lovely and for the price it’s great quality. I am usually a size eight and I ordered the medium/8. It fit true to size for me. It’s a bit long (I’m 5’3”) but nothing a tall pair of heels can’t take care of. I am excited to wear it for New Year’s Eve!
4.0,"flattering, gives you the look of wearing a two piece while wearing an one piece. and the built in cups help too"
4.0,"Great scarf-like necklace, not so great communication from the vendor when I had not received it.  My neighbor came home from a business trip and brought it over to me.  Now I'm a happy camper!  Love this necklace!"
4.0,"They were given as a gift to someone that loves and knows pearls, to quote her; &#34;they are quality earrings, but I especially like the posts, they are difficult to put on and more difficult to come off.&#34; She was concerned about that because she has lost several quality earrings due to the post."
4.0,Used for cycling....
4.0,"Oh I loved this dress, but it was to small I had to return it. It sure was pretty though."
4.0,"Nice quality, paint looks good."
4.0,"I couldn't use it for what I bought it for, so Iended up giving them away as gifts. They were very pretty, and not cheaply made."
4.0,"Nice color, fits as I was hoping, not too tight or too loose.  Was expecting a bit softer fabric, but it is okay."
4.0,They look great but they're rather hard to put into place. Love them though!
4.0,Loved the look and quality.  Slightly loose but the seller offered to compensate.
4.0,It has a nice finish is good on it the handle is big enough to make it easy to hold on to.
4.0,The fit is good.no complaints.
4.0,"They definitely look nicer in the pictures, my wife still loved them but they definitely aren't the highest quality. Glad I got them on sale for a low price"
4.0,"The fingers are disproportionately long, so these may be the perfect glove for you. For me, they're okay by themselves, but won't work as a liner for work gloves"
4.0,"I enjoyed this book very much, it tells the story of her ministry and gives a sense of the commitment and meaning in her life.  I have given many copies of this book to others, who have enjoyed it as well."
4.0,Super cute shoes.  Fit a little bigger than expected.
4.0,I just knew these cute little socks were going to shrink in the dryer- but they didn’t- great value
4.0,"I purchased this item as a gift for my (then) girlfriend. It arrived within a few days and I think she really liked it - because she seems to always be wearing it in the pictures that she puts online of her numerous dates, since we broke up."
4.0,Such a pretty hat with nice material. But if you have a lot of hair or a bigger head skip it lol
4.0,Great fit! Great flex! Great Moro jeans. Zipper sticks a little
4.0,"It fit fine everywhere except the bottom hem wasn’t elastic, and getting it over my chest is a bit of a struggle"
4.0,Worked just liked the one that came with my Fitbit
4.0,Bought these for my daughter as an 80s Halloween costume.  They were made sort of thin.  She did not end up wearing them and I returned them.  Hassle free returns.
4.0,"Cute shirt!! Thick, stretchy material which i like... But does fit a little small. So if your a L, definitely get XL. If you are a L and in some stores you fit as an XL, you might even go larger than an XL if you want more a loose t shirt feel.<br />Hope this helps!"
4.0,"I've now bought two different patterns of this dress style and will buy more! They are a great length (I can spin around without worrying what might show), and fit very nicely. Plus - they have pockets!! The pockets are large enough to hold my phone and keys, and the shape of the dress doesn't change dramatically when you put things in the pockets."
4.0,Love the dress. It just took forever to get here.
4.0,"I love this sweater. I was nervous ordering online and I’m pretty particular about fit. I have been looking for an oversized “cozy fall” gray sweater and came upon an article that linked to Amazon sweaters under $25. I’m 5’ 2.5” and 135 lbs; it did take a bit longer to arrive and upon opening there was an unpleasant packaging smell. I did wash on cold, and threw in the dryer *i know, big no no for fear of shrinking* but once I did so, it smelled and fit like I had hoped. Sleeves fit hitting just below the wrist, and the longest portion hits at about my knee. Very cute with skinny jeans or leggings."
4.0,We love the necklace. It’s just a little pricey.
4.0,"This is a very clever product. It stays in place and it gives you the freedom to use your hands, walking the dog, hold bags or even tuck them in your pockets.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the plastic band that holds the umbrella on your head. I think it should be made with a softer non-plastic material because this one gives a strange feeling. If they correct that I would definitely get more umbrellas like that. It would also be nice if I came in other beautiful colors."
4.0,"While I don't normally wear pins, I decided I needed one to brighten up all of my black-on-black ensembles. This pin does that perfectly. It is not TOO blingy for my conservative, suits and ties required type of job. It can help make a plain outfit look more dressy (both in a professional crisp way as well as in a day-to-evening way). While travelling, I have moved this from a pin to putting it on a chain to wear as a necklace, to fastening in my hair."
4.0,Its very pretty but too big for my 13YO.
4.0,Great with leggings!<br />Washes well
4.0,"The masks look very pretty! The give full coverage and the material is very nice— not cheap looking. The only thing is that they have a very stinky odor. I’ve put them in a delicates laundry bag and will wash them tonight on cold and delicate to see if that sorts it out. If they become ruined after that, I’ll update my review.<br /><br />The white color was very wedding-ish. I can’t imagine what I could use it for. The silver one was a bit too shiny and bright for me. But the champagne and black ones are very pretty."
4.0,fit as expected. The white shirt part is somewhat thin though. But overall a good product.
4.0,To small for Mom
4.0,I like the style and color. The dress looked longer in the photo. The fabric is soft but stiff. Not as much stretch as I expected. A little heavy for summer wear but great with leggings and boots.
4.0,"Got what i expected and i absolutely love it! It is, however, a little long so i don't suggest wearing it with a shirt that is too low."
4.0,Lightweight.  Fabric is not thick.  Handle was long enough to fit over my shoulder for easy traveling.  Nice design. Arrived quickly as I was in a pinch.
4.0,I love it!!!!°
4.0,Love these rings! They are very pretty and fit well.
4.0,I wore these to a Christmas company party and they were a hit.  The feel silky and very tight fitting but fit as expected.  Size medium: 4-6
4.0,Nice but wrinkles quickly and having to take it to the cleaners gets tiresome.
4.0,"These are fantastic. Holding up nicely after each wash. We are a one-time wear and then wash family so masks have been washed well over 30-40 times since purchase two plus months ago. Run a little petite. Great for women, teens and children. Snug fit on ear pieces, comfortable."
4.0,Love it. It beautiful and it looks like the pic
4.0,"I really liked this top. But the sleeves were about 3 inches too long!  I ended up cutting off the extra and hemming the sleeves to wear it.  Still worth it, but a bit disappointing.  i don't know anyone with arms that long too warrant such long sleeves!"
4.0,What a beautiful necklace. Pictures don't do it justice. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
4.0,I really liked these sun glasses! They are cute and fit as expected. They look just like the picture.
4.0,it was what i wanted<br />Thanks
4.0,"This is an otherwise great vest, but the zippers are complete garbage.  Out of the box the majority of them will split easily.  Definitely wouldn't leave anything in the pockets of value, as there is a great chance it'll end up lost."
4.0,Was too big in the stomach and too small on the arms. Still wear it though cause it’s so cute!!!!
4.0,"I bought a size up and glad I did. Roomy but not too big, comfortable to sleep in.  Cute pattern and soft material."
4.0,"I would have actually given this the 5-star rating, except I ended up paying more for the postage than for the keychain (My Bad!!!)<br /><br />JUST A NOTE: Also, it (Marilyn figure) is about 3-inches high. I don't think this was said on the web page, so I wasn't exactly sure how big is was."
4.0,Absolutely love!!!! Wishing for more soon!
4.0,Really nice and very comfy.<br />Had to size up half a size
4.0,This shirt is very cute and looks great - especially for a man. Runs small. Recommend ordering a size up.
4.0,"I think this shirt is really cute. I feel like I waited forever for it to come because it came all the way from China lol. I tried this on over a tank top just quickly for the pictures. It fits nice but there's a few random strings hanging off of it. Not a huge deal, I can just cut them off.<br />There is no tag at all, so you don't know which is the front or back, I guess it doesn't really matter with this stud shirt but there's also no washing instructions, they'd probably be in Chinese anyways so guess that doesn't matter either.<br />All in all, it's a cute summer shirt!! I like the color too.<br />I really hope it doesn't shrink to much!! I will update this review if I have any issues after washing.<br />I purchased this shirt at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I love this ring. It's so beautifully detailed.<br />My only problem is that the inlay of &#34;om mani padme hum&#34; is not fully attached to the ring, so it snags on clothing and the metal bends. Bummer."
4.0,Its an ok dress. It didnt work for me but overall is pretty cute.
4.0,"It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be, and my Iphone 6 plus barely fits in it.  But, I'm using it.  Hopefully the leather will stretch a bit."
4.0,"These look great, I'm a bit of a sucker for aviators. They are pretty good for the money, but I can't give them 5 stars initially. Quality is again, pretty good but, if I compare them to other sunglasses I own, they do not come very close. It's a little unrealistic, because my comparisons are to Prada, Cavalli and Versace. But I didn't get them to hold up long term like these, some of which I have had for over a decade. Just for around the yard/garden so I'm not going to damage an expensive pair of sunglasses. To that end, $10 is a great price."
4.0,A delicate gift for a delicate girl...
4.0,Very cute but not packaged well so beware of the hook when you open.
4.0,Protect
4.0,The clip holds the lens away from the glass lens quite a ways.  The lens should have been wider to fit my glasses.  There are what I ordered.  I will order the correct size next time.
4.0,The size is nice and it’s better quality than I expected At first glacé.
4.0,I was hoping for something like I used to have.  This is very close.
4.0,"Pretty bracelet, arrived promptly, nicely packaged.  A bit different than the picture - smaller pearls, and very thin silver strings.  Also took a while to untangle.  Looks nice on the wrist.  I would recommend measuring your wrist before ordering.  Its fit is quite snug."
4.0,"Looks good and feels comfortable.  Like the color as less likely to show dirt.  Minor issue is that to get a size that fits my upper body, the sleeves are a little long.  But I just roll them up."
4.0,"I think it’s a really cool dress that is actually pretty good quality.<br />It does come way too small though. I ordered my normal size, XL and it did not fit me at all. It did fit my girlfriend who is a size M though. I had to get a 4X but it fits great and I love it. They were wonderful about getting me the size I needed and very prompt.<br />There is an issue with the seams though, the thread likes to come undone. I like the more messy, punky look of it so it’s not an issue for me, but something to keep in mind."
4.0,I would have given 5 stars because it is very nice but first time husband used it the head came off. He glued it with gorilla glue and it is fine now. He loves it but was a little disappointed to have the head come off immediately.
4.0,Great rug just smaller than I expected.
4.0,Should be exclusive to women not both sexes.
4.0,"Super cute. Just wore it to my friends wedding. It was long enough for me being tall. If you are shorter it may be a bit long (below the knees). The one thing to be aware of is if you have hips and a butt but a slightly slimmer top,  the waist/bottom will fit perfectly, but the top will be open under the arms. Easy fix with a cute cardigan or throw. Would but again, maybe try a smaller size."
4.0,I'd order a size up
4.0,"Love the design, fabric & style.  Great for sun protection & very stylish. I get so many compliments."
4.0,First the good. Band is pretty and as pictured. Bad is it’s very stiff and very long. My wrist measured too big for the small so I ordered the large but this is man size! I think the small would have fit. I recommend you order the same size as your original.
4.0,"Good value for the money,  light weight fabric.  Will see over time how well they hold up.  Size seems to run small as first pair I ordered (L) is my normal size with similar products.  Had to return and order a size up (XL)."
4.0,"I really like this purse.  Its sturdy and I think the price is fair.  There isn't too much space in the 2 side pockets, but that may be a good thing.  The only thing that made the bag appear a little cheap in my opinion is that the gold painting around the name on the front of the bag dripped onto the navy blue ""leather"".  But other than that, its a solid purse that will be great for the winter season."
4.0,Casual use
4.0,The length of a shirt was a little short for my liking other than that it was perfect if you're a taller person like me you should reconsider buying this or you can wear a camisole underneath of it that's longer sub to you depends on a few Michael layering clothes on
4.0,The snoring never stopped from what I was told.
4.0,4 stars for Price...great boot otherwise
4.0,Very lightweight. Just what I wanted.
4.0,"No complaints about these yoga lounge pants. Soft 100% cotton material. Navy is a very dark navy; had to check that it wasn't my black ones. Pockets may come in handy. Wide legs at the bottom, so if you're looking for something after some kind of knee surgery, these would work well. They are certainly longer than ""capri"" on me, but I have short legs; but they don't go as far as ankle. I have not yet washed, but I think they'll shrink if I don't line dry or air dry."
4.0,These are beautiful even more beautiful in person I got the green and the red the color is very vibrant and these airings are very light weight I would’ve given it a five star because the packaging was not so great the metal part that goes in your ears was a little bit bent because they need a little bit more sturdier packaging  but I’m still getting more colors
4.0,Bag is nice. However took almost a month to deliver.
4.0,"Great backpack. I've used it for a few weeks now as a commuter bag. Lots of compartments for laptop stuff. The one thing I wish it had was a strap that went over the laptop sleeve to ensure the laptop doesn't slide out the top if the back is held upside down and then dropped (in which case, there would be nothing padded at the top to protect the laptop). But to get around this I bought a padded laptop sleeve so now I use that inside the backpack's sleeve."
4.0,"These were a bit too small for the selected size, but we’re comfortable and soft. Order a size up."
4.0,"Maybe i misread it. Its a cute dress and fits good, I think I may have ordered the wrong size. But its pretty decent quality and its cute with and without the shaw"
4.0,"I really like the feel and it does not shrink.  I think I would have gotten a size smaller if I had tried this on at a store, but it does fit just like the picture."
4.0,"We picked up a German Shepherd off the streets and nursed him back to health, except he never grew back all his hair. Some virus and bad food allergies, he is on special food. I bought this to keep him from getting sun burned and cold inside the house in the AC. There is plenty stretch around the arm and leg holes and around the neck, so he seems quite comfortable, just not sure what he makes out of it. I will get me another one in a different color, so he can switch out when it gets washed. Good quality material and light enough for the hot Texas summers for our furless baby!"
4.0,awesome !!
4.0,I like the handbag and the color very much..! I will watch your website most often now... Its a little small but over all I like the size as I need to cut down on siz anyway!..
4.0,"So I Ordered a 2x I wear a 38 C, 5'1 198bls<br />I found that the dress fit beautifully but that the cut was lower than I liked."
4.0,"This is my first Sak bag.  It's very attractive, great size, pretty colors and seems well made.  The straps are very comfortable and ironically, when I hold the bag in my hand, it's heavy even when empty but the minute I put it on my shoulder, the weight seems to just disappear.  I wear white tops a lot because they're cool in this hot weather and the bag gives my otherwise boring outfits some pizazz."
4.0,"Fits well, but still manages to catch on things occasionally. I like it a lot though."
4.0,They feel great but are ever so slightly  to small not a big deal if your ears aren't  freshly stretched.
4.0,Dress fits as expected based off their measurements.
4.0,"Hugs a bit in the chest area, I ordered a Medium and am a 34B and the buttons look a bit askew, the arm<br />holes at the end are also a bit snug, but I think that has to do with the elastic closing them off. Def wear shorts when windy though, the slits go up pretty high haha otherwise a gorgeous dress"
4.0,"I'm particular with my cargo pants/shorts. I actually use the pockets for holding books or tools, so the decorative and flat cargo pockets on most cargo pants nowadays are increasingly useless unless I'm reading something no bigger than a novella. Suddenly, I had a $25 Amazon gift card and the need to replace my latest cargo shorts. It took a while to find the right mixture of legitimate, full and deep, cargo pockets with a length of shorts that went beyond my middle school gym uniform. But Coevals shorts seemed to fit the bill fairly well. I went for it.<br /><br />Following the advice of a few reviewers, I purchased one size bigger. I don't know if the size smaller would have been too small, but these fit just fine. The cargo pockets are exceptional and useful (holding Don Quixote right now, thank you very much). The only problem was that the inside front pocket was sewn short because the back side of the top of the cargo pocket was sewn into the lining of the inside pocket. I cut the thread, but it was so tightly connected that I now have a hole in my inside pocket. I'll get a needle and thread and Frankenstein it shut, don't you worry (you were worried, right?), but it was a bit of an annoyance. Still, for how picky I am with what cargo merchandise I purchase, this was pretty spot on. The material seems a bit light, but I'm not going to be using these for construction projects, so I think they'll be fine.<br /><br />So the takeaway is that if you're a fan of classic cargo shorts, these ones might irritate you on a small scale but ultimately be worth the price. It's not like you can't say the same things about most of your friends, right?"
4.0,"Soft fabric, light weight, washes well"
4.0,These were really cute but I wish they weren't so long! I got a large and it for on the waist perfectly but just would has loved it if it was maybe an inch shorter but hey that's just me!(plus I'm a little short ha!) I'm 5'2 weight 130.
4.0,I like the shape and size of the hat.  The only negative is the hat does not have a tie so it cannot be secured and is prone to blowing off in windy conditions experienced at the beach.
4.0,"4 stars for being sexy. I don’t get the impression of durability. When you pull it out of the package, they seem kid sized, but magically, they fit perfectly. The Brave Person tag cracks me up. The mesh is see through, but there’s a liner for the front."
4.0,"Finish doesn't really hold up but nothing to complain about, just the color dull after daily use."
4.0,"Even though the hat I little large, I really liked it and I am not going to return this just because of the size. It is keeping my head really warm. I will surely recommend this."
4.0,"This is a beautiful, well made shirt. However, I ordered a large and it is way too big. Will have to go for a medium."
4.0,"The quality and size look overall nice, they do look more expensive than they are.  Mine are turquoise and only one of them has the irregularity in color I wanted (browns and white marvelozed look) , so I had to turn them backwards to their more plain blue sides.  Could be a fluke... overall very nice."
4.0,They are pretty and girly. The stitches are loose and you have to cut the excess threads.
4.0,"I hadn't known about multi focal glasses until now without a prescription.  I love mine, as I can read, drive, do yard work, and play without changing glasses.  My single focus glasses would work for reading, but anything else was a blur.  They are well made and quite attractive in my opinion."
4.0,I enjoy that it is a lightweight long sleeve jacket that will last through fall.
4.0,"One or two of the lights are out, but still works well after 6 months.  Granted, my son (he's 6) doesn't wear them everyday, and he doesn't go crazy playing with the lights (he sometimes doesn't even put them on), but they have held up well so far."
4.0,Need to exchange for the next size down....order 1/2 size below what you need.
4.0,order down a size if you want to have some sort of definition
4.0,"Ok so this is exactly as shown.<br />Cons<br />The string ripped off the moment I tried it on, so i had to sew it back.<br />The top is very tight, I got an xl and I am afraid it'll rip when I use my arms.<br />The material is very sheer and thin<br />The top is shorter than I'd like<br /><br />Pros<br />Skirt is gorgeous by itself if the top doesn't work out<br />It hit the right place in the front so it's easy to walk yet almost to the ground in the back.<br />Very cute and trendy<br />Perfect swimsuit cover<br /><br />I am 5'6"" 135lbs 38""x29""x38"" I ordered an xl. The skirt fits perfect the top is tight."
4.0,"I followed the size chart and got an XXL. In normal US dress sizes I am a 12. This dress definitely needs a slip and that is why I took off a star. I had also ordered the black one and it did not fit right and got sent back This white one surprised me as it fits better in the shoulders and the waist even though it was the same size, looked like the cut was different. It appeared to wash well, I hung it to dry. I look forward to wearing it."
4.0,Easy to put on with a couple drops of water
4.0,"I can't say anything else about how good they are, and I have only one negative: with certain plastic covers, I see a rainbow of colors that was surprising at first. When I figured out it was only the sunglasses, I was relieved to know I didn't have a defective plastic device screen, etc. Works great with smartphone cameras for an orange polarized snap of clouds, etc!!!<br />UPDATE 28Aug2020: Wear these everyday! It comes with a case but that case is never used as I have these on everyday (it's still summer)."
4.0,Well made & pretty colors. I ordered my size 1x & was disappointed. They will fit but are not loose like the model which is what I wanted. I will keep & if they shrink in washing I will update my review. Size up if you want a loose fit.
4.0,I loved the skirt
4.0,Gave to neice for graduation gift and she loved it.
4.0,"I purchased these for my son, who only has one ear pierced...perfect right! Haven't tarnished yet and the gem hasn't fallen out. He likes them, but now wants the 4mm. Would reccomend."
4.0,Very nice but too long if you’re short like me.
4.0,I love this set. I got it as a gift for Christmas for my boyfriend. The one negative is that the chains are a little short but other than that it's a great gift and conversation starter.
4.0,The cap fits fine but it's a bit big.
4.0,"I haven't actually worn this dress yet. I tried it on to see how it fits. I love it! Normally, I wear a size small, but had to get a medium in this dress. I am 5'2"", 135 lbs. The length of the dress is at my knees. The fit is very nice, just right for me. The sleeves seem a little long, but not a problem. I believe I will like wearing this dress very much."
4.0,Had a blemish on back
4.0,Could use some more detail but was very comfortable.
4.0,Great item just wish I'd noted that the chain is only 12 inches so it's unwearable. Will need to return.
4.0,"When I got the case, I was surprised at just how big it is, particularly its height.  In fact, it's so tall I could almost nestle two smaller pairs of sunglasses in there at once.  However, as with the previous reviewer, I was unable to fit one of my pairs of sunglasses into the case, because the case simply isn't long enough to hold my aviator-style glasses.  Smaller glasses fit just fine, but again have lots of unnecessary vertical room, and this would take up a lot of space in a small backpack.  It's far too big to ever think of putting it in even a large pocket.<br /><br />Despite the odd sizing, the case appears to be very well made, particularly considering the price.  The shell is very sturdy, the spring feels appropriately stiff, and the inner lining is soft enough that it shouldn't cause any scratches.  Overall, it's a very good deal, but be aware that not all sunglasses will fit despite the significant volume the case consumes."
4.0,"Soft and snuggly fleece, roomy and comfortable. She loves them."
4.0,"GOOD quality for the price but too big for me. I am 5'2&#34; and 118 lbs. Based on the size chart, I expected the small one to fit me well but it is quite large. I will definitely be able to wear a few layers if I need to."
4.0,"I used this on a 14 day Elk hunt. I loved using it, the only issue I have is the stretchable pocket on the top that holds a phone stretched itself out over a few days, making my cell fall out if I bent over too much. I had to add tissue to bulk it up so it wouldn't fall out. Other than that, I love it."
4.0,Fit as expected but the material is very itchy and hot. I would most likely rebuy just because of how much I like the fit but really wish it was a cotton fabric. Do not dry this or it will shrink.
4.0,This Aoymay women's nightgown ran a lot smaller than expected for a 2x. I dont personally like my nightgowns to cling to me. On the bright side it is well made and quite soft but I was disappointed in the sizing.
4.0,Well made and fast service.
4.0,This sports bra is very comfortable! My only complaint would be that the extra strappy part on the side sometimes gets my arm caught when I try to put in on. But this sports bra is very soft and fits very well! Perfect for running or whatever other workout you want.
4.0,"Super cute, just as described."
4.0,great logo
4.0,How it looks on me even though I'm pregnant is really complementary.
4.0,Stylish and practical!
4.0,Satisfied with this item.
4.0,"Grey mixed fiber socks with a great texture and seam over the toes. Long, about 11"" when you wear them.  However, they were too tight for my calf muscles,  so I opened the hem making them 13"" long. Now I like them. My leg muscles are developed and measure around 15"", if you have skinny legs, don't need to worry about the tight hem on top.<br />The stitches are tight and the texture smooth. My shoe size is 8 and they have the elasticity to accommodate my feet very nicely.  Very well made socks with machine technology to anatomically wear feet with style and protection"
4.0,"Although it is very cute and I got lots of compliments on this item, it is way too large. It fits much larger than it shows. I bought a small and it fit more like a large than a small. I'm hoping it shrinks in the wash."
4.0,"Pretty good wallet. The construction is done well. It is a trifold wallet there's a plasic cover for the ID case and 3 slots for credit cards. There's also a design on the back. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the design on the back to me detracts from the quality -- cheapens it in my opinion. Also the leather isn't as heavy duty as I'd like. But again, the construction is good."
4.0,"I had a hard time figuring this one out and felt like I needed a second person to help wrap me in this mummy like thing. There is ALOT of fabric to this thing! I feel like the loop at the end will eventually break bc there’s not much to it. Once you get this wrapped around your body the 215 times it’ll wrap, the comfort is what you make it.  If you like your organs smashed so tight you can’t breathe but you don’t want to wear an actual corset then tighten this baby up. If you like to breathe, loosen it. Once tightened it does give the hourglass shape with some bumps bc you’re layering the wrap on itself so no body con for you! All in all I think it does what it says.  Idk that I’d recommend this — just go get a corset. But if this is your style. I say go for it."
4.0,very nice quality would but from them again.
4.0,"Loved the stretch/very breathable… wore in Mexico… fabric super thin, so wearing a bra/underwear may not be feasible for all…"
4.0,"I bought this hat because other people posted &#34;trust me, I have a huge head and this fit me just fine!&#34; Well guess what, I really do have a huge head and this was way too small for me. I still give it 4 stars because it worked for my wife and the lights did work and it was fun. Actually the lights are super bright, she turned it on in a bar and 4 people went permanently blind. Well, maybe not that bad, but still they are bright!"
4.0,Wore them for my birthday on a brunch cruise. My only complaint is there’s no back belt loop which makes the belt rise up which was kind of annoying but besides that I love them! Got a Large.
4.0,"Es lindo, suavecito pero esperaba el cierre fuese mejorcito"
4.0,Comfort & length
4.0,Cute. A little sharp on the edges.
4.0,"These are very good cooling sleeves. While you may think the black band at the top might be annoying, it's been my experience that after a minute or two, you don't notice them. I initially ordered the XL and they were a little short on me (I'm 6'2&#34;, 185 lbs), but when I started that on a review, their customer service for in touch with me and allowed me to order another pair. I ordered the XXL and they fit great. I rated them a 4 instead of a 5 because I'm not a fan of the seam. It's not really annoying, it's just another place where the sleeve could possibly separate. I would recommend these, but I also recommend you buy a size larger than you think. BTW, if you're looking for a compression sleeve, that is not what this is."
4.0,Nice watch but i didn't like the color of the leather and my gold detailing clashed with my silver rings. I didn't think of that when i bought the watch. also i thought the face would be slightly bigger
4.0,"This is freaking great for my Ghost Recon cosplay. The material is breathable but you might need some antifog for your goggles because they might fog up. Also the desert one I had, at least, had the skull thing printed on both sides"
4.0,It's not as cute as it seems on the picture
4.0,"I would give this 5 Stars however it runs a little bit smaller than most large scrub tops run. I'm still able to wear but don't have as much room to move around in.<br />Good quality, and cute print."
4.0,Very nice my wife loves it
4.0,"Awesome blazer, great fit."
4.0,Top is tied by string and doesn’t stay tied
4.0,"The color upon arrival was more turquoise than the picture shows, and the size was a little smaller than expected.  I would of liked it a bit less form fitting."
4.0,"So I'm 5'7"", about 170 pounds. I wear mediums, but a bit on the thicker side and I definitely should have sized up. I ordered a medium and should have gotten a large. It's alright though because my daughter will absolutely love it. The material is that thick, seamless moisture-wicking type. It feels sturdy, but I had to take a star off because there is a long string hanging from the seam in the armpit. I'm afraid to cut it and ruin the seam, but I may have to try because it's over an inch long."
4.0,"What a pretty dress! However, a bit hard to fix properly in the back by yourself! 😂😂<br />It's very flattering and has a bit of a stretch. It is a wee bit see through, but easily fixed with a 'underskirt'<br />My usual size is 6-8 and I bought the Medium."
4.0,Good fit for the average size 6 month old head with room to grow. Worked great for fireworks. Storage bag is great to store in while not in use.
4.0,Compre lo q vi
4.0,It looks nice but I should get a smaller size
4.0,Very lightweight but noce quality size runs very small
4.0,"I’m 5’3”, 130 pounds and purchased a size medium. It fits great! In tops, I’m usually between a small & medium, and opted for a bigger/baggier look. It’s loose, but not ill-fitting. The length hit mid-thigh and the sleeves hit mid-hand. Nice material, good texture with the furry leopard spots, and love that it’s knit (not printed). Soft, cozy, and not itchy. The only negative, although this is a personal preference, I wanted a “messier”, edgier, or more casual look with this sweater as it is pictured online. However, it’s a bit more refined than I had expected. It’s still worth keeping!"
4.0,Arrived promptly and fits well.  Will be able to wear over a sweater or blouse without looking bulky.
4.0,Order a size or two up! Didn't quite fit &#34;shirt&#34; like.
4.0,"I like the size of this tote/purse.  The bottom is wide just like the top which is something that I have looked for in my purses. Most purses/totes have a narrow bottom and that doesn't work for me.  The inside detachable pouch is nice to have but it comes unsnapped all the time. That is a pain but I can live with it.  I don't like the tassel.  It makes it look cheap. Also, it would be nicer looking if the gold hardware was brushed nickel color instead.  I don't like the gold but for the price, I can live with it too."
4.0,Smudges are difficult to remove. but overall they work
4.0,"Nice coat, but you will need to go up 1 size from what you normally wear."
4.0,My granddaughters loved these masks
4.0,"I love it for travel is perfect, i love it"
4.0,"Love them, they really sparkle"
4.0,"Good quality; sturdy and can't beat the price. They do 'grab' the eyeglass frames snugly so need 2 hands to attach and remove. Rec 15 is a little narrow from top to bottom for me.  I should have gotten 'Rec A', but that's my bad for not understanding that spec better. A tad heavy, but that's likely due to the full frame which is an acceptable trade-off for me over frameless."
4.0,"I believe I got a large in this because the other review said that the waist does not stretch around the sequins -- SO TRUE, I wish I could've sized down because the top part is long and probably meant for people with longer torsos. I am 5'3&#34; and usually wear a 8/10 in pants and a medium/large in shirts.<br /><br />It's really cute though, I love the look of it - not SUPER flattering, and definitely will need pasties"
4.0,Fits revo bearing sunglasses just barely. Haven't had a chance to test them on the lake.
4.0,Only getting 4 stars because they do not look like the picture. Still beautiful and will still wear them
4.0,"This is a super cute dress.  The quality is good, and it is not too tight.  There are no loops for the belt, but that's ok.  It is a little shorter than I expected. I am 4'10, and ordered the medium.  If I want to pull it loose at the top to get the same look as the picture, it is shorter than I would like.  Overall it is a nice piece."
4.0,"I usually wear bangles or big cuff bracelets but this came up in my recs & I liked the look. It's even prettier in person. It takes some getting used to, though, as it goes on & wears differently than what I'm used to. Overall, it was something new & different for me. It pairs beautifully with a lot of leaf jewelry I have, so it will be worn but my first impression is that I like bangles & cuffs better."
4.0,Our grandson loves the chefs hat & apron. Looks just like what the pros wear.
4.0,"The order took well over a month and a half to arrive, but the size was perfect and my daughter loved it."
4.0,Color was perfect but when I finally tried it on Fitbit one side kept falling off so I  couldn't use it. Company sent out replacement and it fit perfectly. Thank you
4.0,Nice long hoodie however it is a bit thin.  Great for spring but not for winter.
4.0,Love these earrings definitely great to wear dressed up or down.
4.0,"It is gorgeous skirt, double layered but run extremely small and short. I read the reviews before I ordered. I order size small even though I am XS yet was very tight. I just ordered M this time, finger crossed."
4.0,"Very nice clubbing evening -ware., for young to middle aged.Does include a few rhinestones no quite finer quality of those few stones.all in all, Cute."
4.0,Very cute dress!  Big hit at christmas! Fit is as described.
4.0,The fitting is fine but i guess i made a mistake on ordering thinking that they were cotton.
4.0,Good for after ointment applications.  Saves greasy socks in the wash.
4.0,I liked the color. It was as expected.
4.0,Super static-y.  Make sure to order scotch guard as an add on.  Cute otherwise.
4.0,"Wasn't really sure what to expect. I mean silicone? It's pretty awesome though! Only thing is... If you're a half size get the smaller size, not the bigger size. These are silicone, so they're stretchy and if you go bigger they will not feel secure. Other than that, they're great! Perfect if you can't wear any type of metal at your job."
4.0,Great price for a good product!  Seems well made and arrived FAST!!  WILL DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN! ❤
4.0,Gift! She loved it!
4.0,"Really cute. Fits a little big , but better than too small. It's good quality ! It ties in the back so you can  tighten when needed. The skirt part seems a bit longer in front than in the back. But overall it's so cute and looking forward to swimming in it next week"
4.0,works as promised
4.0,Nice necklace. Looks like quality
4.0,"Runs just a little big. But it’s a great, fun dress."
4.0,"I received a discount on this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.  This top is cute and good quality.  I like it, but it runs a little small.<br /><br />Note, the collar has a leather patch, not a cut out."
4.0,Love everything about this legging... but they run big and stretch alot so they were too big for me.
4.0,Looks great! Held up well.
4.0,I love this hoodie! Only thing is it runs a little small so I recommend getting the next size up.
4.0,So far so good.. my only issue is the box lock doesn’t stay snapped together without the safety latched.
4.0,"I bought this for my niece. The color is beautiful!  It’s super soft and she loves that it has pockets!<br />The problems that I see, are that it’s a tad  see through and it’s shorter than I thought it would be.<br />If you aren’t going to be walking around in a house full of family, or you don’t care, it’s a nice, cool nightgown.<br />It would also make a great swimsuit cover up"
4.0,I absolutely love this dress. I ordered a larger size from what I normally wear (1 size up) it's a fitted dress. I'm glad I did order a larger size. It may run a little too short for some. The dress is a little bit above my knee (I'm 5'5) this was without heels.
4.0,"These shorts fit well and look good. However, what I received required me to break out the scissors and cut off multiple hanging threads. It’s not the end of the world, but I expected better quality control from Reebok."
4.0,Just wish i got a  double X instead but a great coat n style for this price
4.0,Had to replace missing collar button with the spare sewn in the shirt tail.
4.0,"The bag form is very nice, but the leather quality is really not good, especially the handle which is very thin, and look cheap"
4.0,"OLIEYE WAYFARER SUNGLASSES FOR MEN<br /><br />These are a decent pair of lower priced sunglasses. They have a plastic frame, composite lens, along with a polarized lens which cuts down on glare and haze and allows you to see better.  There are easy to fit nose pads and temples for your specific fit on your head.<br /><br />The glasses arrived in a nice snap-type black glasses case.  Also included is a cleaning cloth which is a nice extra!  They are boxed very nicely if you are perhaps giving these as a gift to someone.  Me?  I am keeping these for ME!!!!<br /><br />I always wear sunglasses in the summer and the winter months too when that sun is beating down on snow.  Wow, snow and sun combined can make you almost blind if you aren't wearing any sunglasses.  I wear sunglasses all the time when I am out, even one night when I left a friend's and couldn't understand why my dash lights were so low -- took me to almost home to realize I had my sunglasses on and not my real prescription glasses, but that is another story!<br /><br />OLIEYE makes many different types of glasses -- night vision, prescription, sports cycling, and computer glasses.  These are a little light weight, but I know by keeping them in the handy sturdy case or on my face that I will get years of good use out of them.  Nice pair of glasses for yourself or your loved ones"
4.0,Looks just like the pic. Good shirt for the price. It's loose not form fitting. Comfortable. Lace sleeves held up in washer dryer just fine.
4.0,I liked how quick it got to me. There is nothing about the order I disliked.
4.0,Very nice tie. Easy to use. Looks very professional.
4.0,"El producto cumplió las expectativas, la felpa protege los anteojos de rayones, su base es estable, el material de buena calidad, sin embargo después de un tiempo de uso la base se despegó."
4.0,"My daughter is a very slender tall 10 year old and the leotard fits well. If I would have purchased size 10-12, it would have been too short."
4.0,I really like this watch band but even though I got s/m it’s way to big. It just flops all over my wrist.
4.0,my daughter loves the set and wears or uses them every chance she has
4.0,Bought this tie in a pinch for my son's homecoming.  It arrived quickly and we were able to adjust it easily and without fuss.  It comes exactly as pictured and is definitely a gold tie….not yellow.
4.0,Good quality of fabric. Looks elegant on.
4.0,Con el tamaño todo bien.<br />El color aparenta mas puro en la foto.  Teniendo ya el sueter es un rojo estilo vintage .  Parameciera sueter viejo.  Pero asi es es estilo de este.
4.0,The eyeglasses are super light which I love about it. I think it’s too big for head. It doesn’t stay secure. I would call these red but more like a light transparent pink. The lens are transparent light brown. Glasses does come with a soft case.<br /><br />I post a photo of me in Snapchat with their glasses so you can have an idea how much bigger the are than other glasses.<br /><br />The lens are 2 1/2 length and 2 inches in width. The length of the entire glasses are a little over than 5 1/2.
4.0,Love. A little heavy and wrinkle bad. But color and fit was good. Got large 36d/ 180lb/5'7.
4.0,"This is a very pretty, pleasing necklace that will go with either formal or casual clothing.  The pearl is very small, but overall the necklace is quite attractive."
4.0,The shade it’s a little different that photo quality is ok
4.0,Love wearing every day. Good quality.
4.0,It is just the kind of hat I was looking for. I would give it 5 stars except the sizing is a bit small.
4.0,i recommend sizing up
4.0,"Cute, adds flare to my bracelet."
4.0,Fabric looks great. Its a nice oversized dress. The slit is on the sides. I got a gold belt and just bring it over if i want the slits to look different.
4.0,Soft - nice material and style. Great to accessorize!
4.0,"Love it! Right size, golden color, enough space for a cell phone."
4.0,Item came earlier than expected. The only complaint is I had to cut the button holes because they were sewn shut
4.0,"Didn't purchase.  I wanted sunglasses to fix over my prescription glasses. Otherwise, very cool looking!"
4.0,"I love this shirt... and my dumb a&& didn't even notice the pockets when I ordered it so HEY HEY it has pockets!  It does run very large.. I bought and XL because I wear a size 12 jeans and other XL shirts I've bought either fit perfect or swallow me.. it's a 50/50 crap shoot.. this one swallows... I have to roll the sleeves up twice because my arms are apparently kid length by their measurements.  Other than that.. love it.. LOVE IT.. soft, comfy.. cute.."
4.0,unless you are extremely thin with virtually no chest this doesn't fit like the picture. its a very cute sweater and still looks nice. I have a small torso and still the material at the top doesn't fold down like that.
4.0,"Love these booties! I have wide feet and I’m usually an 8.5 but the 9’s work well. I have purchased two in the last year, my only complaint is the felt rubs off the back of the heal and starts peeling in strips pretty quickly. I’ve literally spray painted them black to avoid how obvious the deterioration is. Love the shoes, but they could be constructed better."
4.0,A little small fitting but it is an official star wars item
4.0,"The vest is made well. Material is good quality with just enough padding. The only issue is that the XS is more like as small, but good enough for the look I wanted and the price, not bad..."
4.0,"I bought these to put bridesmaids gifts in for my wedding.  The quality was slightly lower than I was hoping, but I also wasn't trying to spend a ton of money on each bag, so I feel like they were fairly priced for what they are.  I bought the blue and silver ones, but the color is much more turquoise than blue as shown in the picture."
4.0,My 9 year old daughter loves her new watch!
4.0,Although I got my size and the material stretches somewhat it is smaller than expected.
4.0,They do cut the glare. Helps with night driving as well as bright lights in stores and elsewhere. They are rather cheaply made. The plastic lenses don't have the clarity I would like.
4.0,"The shorts run large. I sized down from the normal size I wear. The product page says the shorts are cotton, they feel more like a linen material."
4.0,numbers are nice and big! chain length is really short though but didn’t tarnish in sweat or shower.
4.0,"Very soft. Fit like I'd hoped. I'm 5'9 and 150ish pounds. I like my shirts roomy. I got an XL and love it. Can't beat it for the price. Shipping took forever, but it still came sooner than was said. Yay."
4.0,"I like it, but it's quite bigger than I thought it would be. Otherwise, it deserves 5 starts."
4.0,The material feels good and it doesn't obstruct your movement.
4.0,"I like these as they seem to do what they promise... screen out the blue spectrum from computer and device screens.  My eyes seem less tired, though I’ve only used them for a limited time."
4.0,"It's nearly impossible to find a size 30C bra here in the US; if you are small-boned and small-breasted it can be hard to find a bra that fits at all. After inadvertently flattening out my poor ittybitties in A cups for years, I finally found A Bra That Fits and calculated my true size: 30 C. I've been on the search for a comfy fit ever since. Thank God for Amazon, because if it were up to the USofA, I'd still be miserable in too small A cups or too big 34B bras.<br /><br />Now as for this particular bra: it fits wonderfully, gives a nice lift, and is comfortable as a push up bra can be. The straps are some of the softest, most comfortable I've found. My only small complaint, and it's one very common for me and could just be how I'm built, is that the front snap area is slightly uncomfortable where it rests on my breastbone. All things considered, I'm pretty satisfied with this bra."
4.0,Awesome coverage and super comfortable but a little warm.
4.0,They are pretty nice
4.0,Yes it's thin and not great quality but I like it. I don't like having thick bulky scarfs around my neck so this one is perfect for me.
4.0,Pretty color and serves its purpose. Bust is cut a bit low
4.0,My son loved it! It was the perfect size and fit.He has flat feet so he switches between two brands or which shoes doesn’t bother his feet the most.
4.0,Seems like it’s cropped i got a latge and its just not as ling asbi like and the arms arent long enough. Nice material
4.0,As described. Not bad for a cheaper pair of sunglasses. Polarized and wear fairly well was what we needed and that's what we got.
4.0,"Very cheap material, but for less than six bucks, couldn't expect too much.  Overall, ok."
4.0,I ended up returning this because I was expecting a terry cloth polo.  The quality was nice though with the 4 buttons and nice hippo logo.
4.0,"Boy likes them, he said their comfortable."
4.0,Different look and feels like they are well made.
4.0,It is a leather band.  Decent quality
4.0,The shirt is a lovely material and well made.  However it is not for large breasted women.  The seam for underneath the breast fell across the nipple line and the rest of the shirt flared out in an unflattering way.  Some give to the material but the seams and stitching did not.  Arms were tight as well.
4.0,Really don't need a slit but just bought wrong size love the material...
4.0,JUST RIGHT<br />THANKS
4.0,I gave to my friend as a present. She wore it just fine.
4.0,Hard to find size. Fit my small oval glasses great.
4.0,"At first I slid in the yoga pants, it fit just perfect and for right length of my legs.  I wish they come in different colors that I'd order in charcoal grey, navy blue, maroon, and olive green.  Also it would be nice they included a small pocket.  Feeling so comfortable and moving freely."
4.0,I bought this for my fiance and she looks great in it. The dress is fun and people compliment her when she wears it.
4.0,Got this set for me and a friend. Overall very cute and soft. They are a bit big and difficult for my to wear with my glasses but I still like them. It can also be a tad difficult to breath when wearing it but it’s not too bad. My friend liked them as well.
4.0,"I love these cute gauges so much! Sadly my ears got irritated from wearing them. So if you have sensitive ears, put a small coat of nail polish on it. Other than that the sizes are correct, and they do glow well."
4.0,"Good product and glad I have it, just wish it came in a woman's fit."
4.0,I like the fit and the feel of the fabric. BONUS: They just cover the muffin top too so I don’t need to constantly hike them up.
4.0,I use these all the time at work. Sometimes they don’t hold as well but I’m so glad I bought them. My uniform looks better than 80% of the other guys I work with
4.0,very comfortable to wear..
4.0,pierde el color negro del pantalón muy rapido
4.0,"Shirt cute. I Dont like the fabric the collar and cuffs are made of, makes the shirt look a little cheap."
4.0,I ordered a different pair of DeFeet socks from another seller and the size difference is substantial. These were large and the others were just right. They were both size Medium. There was nowhere to choose male or female but that's about what the difference is. If they are going to sell socks for the different sexes they should specify which you are buying. I will still wear the socks and I'm really not sure who's fault it is that the sizing is incorrect.
4.0,My husband enjoyed it!
4.0,Eh.  A little fake looking to me but they are ok for a sunny day. She liked them and they matched a necklace I got for her pretty well.
4.0,Very nice bag good size plenty of pockets. It seems to be durable padding for computer or iPad. This is not a small bag
4.0,"Very warm and pliable ski gloves that have a zip pocket for hand warmer packets. They do get wet, but are easy to dry."
4.0,"I am very sun-conscious and have a variety of jackets and swimwear that provides sun protection but I had nothing for my hands. I came home from a beach vacation with tan lines on my hands from where my long-sleeve rash guard ended.<br />A couple of things to consider:<br />These gloves tend to run small (I am a small female and the size small/medium gloves fit nicely).<br />The edges are rough stitched so that strings are visible, if that is important to you (the reason for only 4 stars and that is being picky).<br /><br />I bought three pair of gloves in order to keep one in each car and one around the house to grab whenever I might get prolonged exposure."
4.0,"Really good quality and fast shipping but god, it smelled like death."
4.0,"Good compression socks, but if you have the calves of someone who lifts, they will cause you pain if you wear them for intense workouts/runs they are so tight! I wear them for work, however, with no discomfort and have 0 swelling after 12 hour nursing shifts."
4.0,Definitely order up. I'm typically an XL (14-16) but ordered a 24 based on other reviews and it fit perfectly.
4.0,"This was a really cute dress, but it ended up being too tight across the bust. However, the main reason I returned it was the smell. It was horrible. It smelled like the strongest smelling B.O. you could ever imagine. I literally had to go take a shower immediately after trying it on because it made my skin smell, it was that strong. I don’t know if it’s the fabric or what, but I don’t know if a washing machine could get that smell out. Not exaggerating, it stunk up my bedroom to the point I had to seal it in the bag again and spray Febreze. Just awful."
4.0,"I grew up with dachshund puppies, so I've always had a thing for them. I love this ring because it keeps them in my memory very well. I also purchased the bull dog ring so how I could I not get this one as well.<br /><br />The shipping was great very quick it arrived sooner than I expected. It is not a fitted ring, it is adjustable so you can move it around to fit really any finger you would like. It is heavier than most jewelry like it but if you ask me that is a good thing rather than bad it just kind of tells you it will stand the test of time better than most like it. So far so good as far as having your fingers turn colors. Mine have not although I do not wear my jewelry all of the time but I do not see that being a problem. I really like the ring it looks just as pictured. It seems to be very durable from what I can tell thus far. I would recommend it if you are thinking about purchasing this little cutie. It is a great choice for animal lovers and it would make a very cute gift. I do want to say before you buy it make sure it will fit your finger accordingly it seems it's best for more slender fingers.<br /><br />I bought this product for a discounted price in return for my honest, unbiased opinion. This is my honest review of the product. I would like any one considering purchasing this product to have enough confidence in my opinion to make an informed decision on if this product is a good choice for you.

4.0,"I love this bathing suit but it was too big, I was going with the reviews i was reading.  The bust were just too big."
4.0,Different from other rings it was a gifth for my granddaughter she liked it.
4.0,It fit to size and wears well
4.0,Very pretty dress. Like the material and color. Quite satisfied.
4.0,"I love the sandals, but had to return the 7 for a 6.  I wish they had 1/2 sizes because I am a very true 6 1/2.  The 7's were  too big and the 6's are just a tad small - my big toe hangs over a smidgen.  Otherwise the arch support is awesome and they are cute sandals."
4.0,I love it! It's so hard to find good rhino apparel.
4.0,I LOVE this dress but the elastic under the bust made me look pregnant or maybe my big belly made me look pregnant haha!
4.0,The tie is fine.  Similar to more expensive ties.<br /><br />I don't like the flap tag on the tail.  It makes it very difficult to tuck through the holding ribbon.
4.0,"Very pretty dress and flattering. I got the dark green and I love the color. I took off a star because the material is thin and I don’t see it lasting a long time. I also wish the skirt was lined. I am 5’4” and 136 lbs and ordered a small and a medium. The small is perfect but the medium works too, it’s just a little loose. I ordered the medium in a print and I am kinda glad I did. When the print stretches out it looks white because of the way it’s printed. But, because  the medium is a little big on me, the print doesn’t stretch as much."
4.0,"Runs just a little big. But it’s a great, fun dress."
4.0,"The quality of this jacket is great and super soft. I ordered the Brown but it is not as shown. It is definitely more of a camel or burnt orange color. I still like it and will keep it, but just a heads up for those of you wanting a true brown."
4.0,The color is a little dark. The quality is good.
4.0,"Very beautiful and flattering dress - just not for daily wear.  I read someone else say that their husband thought it was a glorified choir costume.  Once I put it on, I laughed as I could totally see it!  It would be great for bridesmaid, play, choir, and performance or fancy night out. I returned because I wanted a casual or Sunday dress and the material is not that.  Bummed, because it is very flattering and such a cute style."
4.0,Fit my son
4.0,This is super cute and I used it to separate my key from my moms on my key ring. The ears quickly changed color to be dirty looking and I keep my keys clean so I guess just wear and tear. The key moves around a lot in it so you have to move it when locking and unlocking the door
4.0,Great color.  Classic key holder
4.0,The studs are really cute and we’re easy to put in. They are however very small for most of them you can’t tell what the symbols are. That’s the reason for 4 stars.
4.0,very light in weight; unable to judge Dri-Power feature yet
4.0,"A great gift for Harley enthusiast.  Cost is same as bike oil change, so bike owners would probably not buy for themselves.  Get next size larger due to very slim fit.  Good material and logo patches are subdued and tasteful."
4.0,"Great price and nice quality. I'm 5'10 and bought a small so it was just a tiny bit short for me, but perfect otherwise."
4.0,"I like it and wear it daily. It’s a little hard to adjust and the tag on my right side pokes me if I don’t have a shirt tucked in. I bought this mostly for hikes and backpacking. I haven’t backpacked, but based on my hikes, I think it will work good. (Sometimes backpacking belts and regular belts don’t get along.)"
4.0,The dress would not go over my shoulders. It fits very small. I had to give it to my daughter. She's tiny and it fit her well. The material is silky smooth and the dress looks lovely.
4.0,The size is a bit bigger than expected
4.0,Not awesome for blue violet laser
4.0,"But too small for men... When it's too small, it looks feminine instead of Ken Griffy, Jr. All-star... It's a decent CZ quality, though."
4.0,"Comfortable fit, but somewhat itchy.  Not sure if it is the material itself or just me.  But, great deal for the amount and variety received.  Nicely packaged and quick shipment."
4.0,"Nice and stylish jacket, good for spring time. For size follow the given size chart as If you usually wear small then medium will be better."
4.0,Rings feels premium but the gold might chip off after a few wearings.
4.0,Arch support is a little to high for even a person with high arches. Other than that they fit and look great!
4.0,"It's a great product, bought it before. But... they've changed the size of the case. Now all the items look like they were shoved in it."
4.0,I ordered these in medium but the inseam was only 27 inches and I need at least a 32.  They were nice quality but I had to return due to the length.
4.0,Works well. Covers what I need covered. I wish the rubber at the top was a little more tacky so it would stay on my arm.
4.0,A little too sexy for work for my taste.
4.0,"I'm 5-4, large breasts broad shoulders. I ordered the 2XL according to the reviews. It fits nicely around my waist but a little tight under my arms and doesn't quite come down to my knees. I wish it was 3 inch longer but otherwise I like it it will be wearing it"
4.0,"I am 5'5 (32DD, 27""waist, 38"" hips) and ordered a medium.  I find the top fits well but it has room to spare in the waist/hips and I probably should have ordered a small.  The should straps tie which helps give it more flexibility for different torso lengths.  I have also ties it across and such for different looks.  It is cute and I get compliments when I wear it.  I highly recommend to tie the straps or using a garment bag when washing it."
4.0,"Very cute! The collar is very stiff, almost starchy but I'm hoping after a few wears it will soften up."
4.0,Super cute and good price
4.0,Love how the fabric feels
4.0,A cool looking bag that serves its purpose.
4.0,Great keychain. Worth it.
4.0,Wished someone made a mesh type band. This one can get a little hot.
4.0,Good quality dress but the belt is very short!
4.0,"This top is cute. It’s a little boxy, maybe I should’ve gone down a size. Fabric isn’t very thick. Definitely wouldn’t pay more than the $10 I did."
4.0,Got large -X-Large pretty tight. Maybe could have gotten bigger. But they are just needed for another week.
4.0,"lovely scarf. much thinner than i had anticipated, however."
4.0,very nice but too small will reorder correct size
4.0,My dad loves it. Keeps good time.
4.0,It’s a pretty dope item. It works well def will wake you up if you have trouble with that it’s also good if you fall asleep at the wheal! It will wake you a$$ right the f$$$ up!
4.0,I usually take a large size glove in the USA.  So I ordered the XL size here.  The XL size is still tight and the fingers are a bit short.
4.0,Normally wear medium. Now going to order a pair of XX large. I did like the way they looked. Gave them to my wife. They look really hot on her.
4.0,The beads are plastic but it’s still cute.
4.0,I eventually got a bigger cloth mask which I made it fit up my nose a little bit higher so that I had more space down below for breathing out I don't think anybody can breathe with those masks even with some of that help It did help a little bit with a cloth mask the kind that's the surgical but I have a regular cloth homemade that is a little bit more breathable. I take it off anytime I can get at school it's terrible to have to wear a mask It's unhealthy to begin with
4.0,it was ok but ran small
4.0,"I know my sister is going to love this purse, especially because it glows in the dark. Wish it was a bit bigger."
4.0,A great dress to run around and do my errands in on a hot day. I took away a star because one of the pockets has a hole in it.
4.0,"I am really enjoying this new handbag.  It looks much nicer than the price paid for it.  The only complaint I have is that the center zip pocket is half way down from the top of the purse and can be hard to find when you can't look which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  (I am one of those people that constantly digs around it my purse so I have that problem with all handbags!)  This handbag goes with the Your SMILE silk like scarf in the green chain print.  The combination is stunning.  For the price, the handbag is a steal!"
4.0,"Exactly what I wanted.  Have had it for about a month, wear it almost daily & it is holding up well!  Would buy it again!"
4.0,"Looked great, great price, but my husband jumped in the lake with them on...they dont float f.y.i...so they were good for the week they lasted."
4.0,Dress fitted great.  Also great minds think alike.  Someone had the same dress on.  I ordered two sizes up scared that it would look tight.  I had to wear a belt because it was too big.  The size chart is right.  Order your size.  Overall a great dress.
4.0,A little too long
4.0,"Nice looking, a little heavy.<br />The rose gold color doesn’t match to the watch"
4.0,"I love the ring, sadly its a little too small because it fits but its so snug that it cut off circulation"
4.0,Cute but very very very small! Wont hold wallet or anything - more like a change purse
4.0,Love it<br />Ordered and paid for two. Only received one
4.0,"It's not as big as I imagined, but it's gorgeous and looks exactly like pictured. It is my fault I didn't take the measurements into consideration. I do love it though, and my mom should too!"
4.0,runs a little short.
4.0,"These are the cutest shoes. The blues are bright and vibrant, the beige matches everything. Stylish and practical. They run a little small."
4.0,Size XL fits my 38ddd bust with no gaping but seems tight by waist and back and I am not really big there.  But the material is so soft and comfy that I kept the large I bought so as I lose more weight will still have one to wear.  Also my trucker arms fit in both sizes.
4.0,"Worked great. Easy to use. Perfect for a party, rave, Halloween or any fun gathering."
4.0,"Probably the best dress I’ve ever ordered from amazon. I love the fabric, it doesn’t feel cheap at all.<br /><br />The zipper in the back is also a small golden heart, it’s a very cute touch.<br /><br />The tip is so opaque that no one could tell I was wearing a black bra with this dress! However, the bottom of the dress is completely see thru which is the only reason it has 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Overall, I’d recommend!"
4.0,"Though on a picture it might seem that there's a rubber on the inside, there is none. My hair is really slippery, so I lose these headbands while working out. But that's just me."
4.0,My lens popped out fairly easily after only wearing them for a month or two but I fixed it. Otherwise I like them!
4.0,"It is a nice dress.  The material is the stretchy clingy type that I'm not particularly fond of how it looks on me, but it is comfortable and it is not thin.  The hems are well done, the neckline gives more coverage than I thought that it would.  I still like the look of a lace cami under.  I am 5'6&#34; and on me the skirt length is just to my knees.  The sleeves are a bit small, but that stretchy fabric is good for something."
4.0,Good fit and comfortable!
4.0,Have not seen my daughter wear it yet but she said she liked it
4.0,This leather and copper bracelet is reputed to have medicinal or healing properties. I'm not sure I believe that.<br />I like the natural smooth leather paired with the shiny copper at each end. It is handsome in its simple design.<br />This bracelet is marketed for either men or women.
4.0,Used the buttons to decorate a backpack and they show well.
4.0,"A very pretty dress. I’m not a ruffle person, but I like the stress despite the ruffle straps. It’s a little more formfitting than I’m used to but slimming at the same time."
4.0,Very nice holds more than I'll ever carry in  my wallet.
4.0,It runs really small but it's cute as a button! I wear it with a minimizer bra and a think tank underneath and get compliments on it all the time.
4.0,Like the patterns
4.0,"Thick t shirt material. Not sweatshirt, like I expected. I love how the “sleeves fall. They are comfortable. Only really complaint is that the hood on one of the two shirts I bought is not centered and messes with my OCD."
4.0,Seem pretty rain proof but I don’t know a 12 year old that would fit this. I’d say the age range is from 6-10 at the most.
4.0,"Very comfortable, wish the lining under the dress was longer. If your have a bigger rear the lining can get a little short for the behind."
4.0,I bought it for my mother and it is really nice. Material is a little slick but breathes. However would have preferred snap buttons instead of regular buttons and button holes.
4.0,Love Tilley quality. The only drawback is that it doesn't have the deep fit of the other Tilley hats we have purchased.
4.0,"Fit very big, in addition it has no shape...was just like a large sheet.  It was okay just not what I was looking for"
4.0,"As other reviewers stated, the color of the sweater is off a bit (it is darker) and the material is a bit thin.  And even though it is a bit big, I actually like it like that and am keeping it.  Wouldn't mind having in other colors too."
4.0,"We loved these socks, we got them for crazy sock day at my sons elementary school.Yes, they are mens socks so they qere a bit big, but they worked, he is in 1st grade and wears a 5. I wish the stitching matched a bit better, the main part of the picture was on the inside of the legs. Other then that, super cute!"
4.0,Very nice. I like the fact it is adjustable to hold multiple cards. I only wish it came with a money clip on one side.
4.0,Nice socks and fit well.
4.0,"Think they would be better if they were a post-backing versus French wiring.  But, very nice.  1928 makes costume jewelry look classic."
4.0,They are good but small.
4.0,"deducted a star because some of the finishing was not great, in some areas you could tell the stitching missed the mark"
4.0,Collar is weirdly tall but nice shirt.
4.0,"The watch was very nice. unfortunately, I will be returning, it was not as thin as expected and the weight was too heavy for my 88 year old 100lb dad.  His wrist are small, someone with larger wrist I recommend it. The quality is great for the money."
4.0,It's still a little early to give it a rating but it seems to be okay for now
4.0,Color is actually white with champagne accents.  It appears to be more champagne in the picture.  Nice quality!
4.0,"My glasses are about 4 years old and apparently the newer styles are smaller because most of the overgrazes are not large enough.  These are.  Also my regular glasses are shaded and my old, gray shaded over glasses often made seeing difficult.  This new pair lends a sort of 'golden glow' that brightens what I am viewing while negating the glare.  It's difficult to express what I mean but I recommend them for people who have 'problem reading glasses.'  They come with a fabric case that doesn't amount to a lot but is better than nothing."
4.0,"Lenses are very big for someone with a small face. The wire frame is uncomfortable on my ears. Overall a very cute pair of glasses, and they are made well."
4.0,"They fit good. I didn't give it a 5 only because, they do not have different lengths. They are way to long."
4.0,"Item was nice, material is sturdy plus it has an inner liner i like it. Price could be a bit cheaper."
4.0,I think the size is smaller than expected. But they are comfortable.
4.0,"Love, love, love these sandals.  They are comfortable, really cute, and the color is perfect. These are going to be my &#34;go to&#34; shoe all summer."
4.0,I normally wear XL so based on other reviews I ordered XXXL and it fit my daughter who wears a womens medium. They are super cute so I gave it 4 stars.
4.0,"These work very well for me.  The fabric is comfortable and washes well.  I am a small woman and the fit is just right.  The only thing I don't like is with the individual finger holes, it is a little harder to put on and take off - just need to allow for that."
4.0,Got four stars because zipper broke after first wear.  Nice jacket though outside of that.
4.0,Love everything about this dress. Size small fit well and bmthe best feature is the pockets.....wonderful purchase.
4.0,Seem good for at home IPL I have!!
4.0,"This necklace is beautiful. It sparkles bright. It’s the perfect size and length. It’s not to heavy on the neck.<br /><br />It is pretty hard to clasp, though. I have a lot of trouble with it, as does every single person that has ever helped me put it on."
4.0,"I got these for climbing and they work well - they block the sun, fit my face well and feel pretty good quality. So overall, I'd recommend them for sports/active stuff."
4.0,"Ok product, gets the job done"
4.0,"My husband loves these but I've had issues with them leaving a red ring around my finger. I'm allergic to latex but not silicone so I'm not sure why it happens. I would be cautious if you have a latex allergy but otherwise, they're fine."
4.0,Color is not as vibrant like the pic...material is excellent but is see thru unfortunately. That's why is 4 stars.😕
4.0,"I'm not sure if it's just the series 5 but the band connecter pieces don't match at all. They are much more purple-ish pink than rose gold. That being said, the rest of the band matches so nice that I've chosen to overlook that. the band fits me perfectly without a need to adjust but I have thick wrists and use the M/L band that comes with the watch. The band just looks really nice and I've been wearing it all weekend comfortably and without complaints."
4.0,"Nice pair of shoes.  My son has worn this for several months, and they still look great.  My son has no complaints."
4.0,"Nice, medium weight scarf. Definitely a &#34;go to&#34;."
4.0,Very cute.  Just fits alittle big on me
4.0,"Very cute shoes but they run small, not for wider feet... and they're really stiff, i try to loosen them up but it's painful when they're just too small :/ but good quality!"
4.0,"Nice shoes, very cute"
4.0,Ordered my child's size and they barely fit. I suggest ordering next size up!
4.0,This dress runs a little large
4.0,Very nice!  Good quality/value. Arrived quickly.  Just a tad too delicate ( little details/beads have a tendency of getting loose) but overall very satisfied and I really like the style of the dress.
4.0,"This top did not come with a built in bra but just the tank itself. The material is soft and lightweight, so it is a good workout shirt."
4.0,"I bought these for my Halloween costume as Android 21 from DBZ Fighterz.  They are great! Stitching is good and I wear them just in general, not just for a costume, since they are cute and comfy."
4.0,Was a bit small in the shoulders for me so I gave it to my mom. She absolutely loves it.
4.0,"Definitely fit as expected and are mostly waterproof! They did come squished and required a small dish towel shoved in them for 2 days to regain shape. I deducted a star for this as they could add paper to the shoes prior to shipping. I would definitely buy again,"
4.0,"It’s a beautiful hat, but the size is for adults. I thought it was for kids, I wanted for my 2 years old boy, for a special presentation in his preschool and it was big. But it look cute and he wears even if he can see foward.<br />But it is a good product, It keep the shape and the delivery was perfect on time.<br />The color is brown dark."
4.0,"I have several of this type of bandana. This one is made a bit different with slit for the ears rather then loops for the ears. While this one is completely wearable, it is a little more snug across the mouth  than the loop kind. That makes is just a little bit annoying to wear.<br /><br />It still is an easier option than a basic mask, at least for me. It does not offer the same protection as an N95 mask of course but sometime you don’t need that, you just need to be compliant."
4.0,"I am happy with these sunglasses. I ordered the pink version and they look just like they are pictured. They are, however, a smidge too big for me in terms of fitting on my face, however, nothing too bad and that I can't live with. I do wish there was something on the over ear part so that it is not just straight metal, but again nothing I can't live with. Overall, would recommend these glasses and have been happy with my purchase."
4.0,These bracelets are super cute. Just remember you're not paying a chunk of money for them so don't place over blown expectations on them. That said they're actually made pretty well for just a cute little summer fun bracelet. I got a few for my daughters who're in their early 20's and they loved them. They do take a while to get them so of you want in a hurry...forget it! Otherwise if ya want something cute and inexpensive for summer accessories ya can't beat it!
4.0,"worked for my Wednesday addams costume, fit well, but not for every day use, it doesnt look very real"
4.0,I've never worn a silicone ring and actually liked it.  It was a little thicker than my other rings I've worn so it took a little getting used to it but overall I liked the fit.  It was a little loose but not enough I'd want a smaller size so I'd say it's pretty true to size.  The colors were bright and true to the description picture. I love having a few options to wear depending on what I'm doing/wearing.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  The opinions stated are 100% my own.
4.0,"They work for spa shoes, but they run a little big.  I am keeping them anyway."
4.0,Really like the pendant. Disappointed with the chain. The chain is very thin and weak looking. Purchased another thicker chain.
4.0,Arrived when they predicted. It's very pretty and just what I wanted! :)
4.0,Love the glasses.however the screws came out after wearing a short period of time.
4.0,"Love these for the winter, although this particular item was smaller than i expected, so its a little tight but still great quality, soft and comfortable<br /><br />I would buy this item again"
4.0,My son’s Christmas present. He hasn't  taken it off!
4.0,I ordered a size XL and I honestly wish I had went up a size. It's not overly right it just shows my fupa. I'm not too worried because when I wear it out I'll have on control tights cause it's cold ass moose balls. Overall this dress is amazing I will definitely be ordering other colors. There negatives that list a star are the length though if I go up a size I should be fine. Also the particles. It seems to attract them but a good long brush will fix that. It's an $11 dress it's not gonna be perfect.
4.0,I am 5'2 155lbs i ordered a xl since alot of shirts are smaller than expected. This shirt fit great everywhere except the boob area. My girls want to pop out the sides.
4.0,"I'm really happy with this dress. Fabric is good, and the fishtail train is gorgeous. The color is vibrant too. I purchased a size small for a gala. I'm 5'0&#34; under 110lbs. The shoulder straps are a little too long. The dress fits me well in the torso, although I wish it was a little tighter. Obviously I'm going to have to get it hemmed but a GREAT address for the price. Going to jazz it up with a statement necklace for the event."
4.0,"Good quality, just the price keeps creeping up????"
4.0,Good but too loose
4.0,"This is not Rose Quartz, just fyi. Very pretty but not rose quartz."
4.0,"Great bikini! I ordered it in white. I am 5'8&#34;, 145lbs, 34DD, and normally wear a size 4/6 for pants, and I ordered a large for full coverage on top. The only minor complaint is that my bottoms do not come up AS high on the hip as the picture."
4.0,"I can't wear this skirt because I have birthing hips and they really shine when I slide this on, but my skinny teens really look good in it.  It's not for those with junk in the trunk or birthing hips, but looks great on skinnies with narrow hip structure.  The skirt is very soft and a deep black.  I haven't washed it yet but will place it in a mesh sack and then lay it out to dry.  I think it will shrink just from looking at it.  I will update this review after washing it if it goes wonky in the laundry."
4.0,Cute dress but wasn’t as true to size. I ended up having to get the dress altered because I ordered right before an event. I wish I had ordered a size smaller.
4.0,"Very warm and constructed well.  I would have given it 5 stars, except that it runs a little small and sleeves are  short.  If you're in between sizes, go up."
4.0,I have gotten X large from Amazon before and they fit fine in fact I'm wearing a pair right now but these are much much tighter. I managed to get them on but they're not comfortable.  Colors nice and price good.
4.0,"When I saw these pants, I thought how cute! Not to mention they were a great price so I thought what do I have to lose. They look just like the pair shown, but run super small. I usually wear a medium and ordered a size up and they still looked like they could fit my 10 year old daughter. With that said they do stretch pretty well and I am able to wear them but I would have like them a little bigger. You really can't go wrong for the price!"
4.0,Good shorts but received with one pocket sewn shut.
4.0,"We just received it and wore only once. My toddler loves it. Its easy to put it on and take off. Its warm shoes. Very light weight. What I do not like is that the shoe toungue of only 1 shoe, keeps sleeping to the side. And velcro on one shoe keeps openning. Maybe just unlucky pair."
4.0,Looks very good when you want to dress it up.  Looks good with my watch and when wearing dresses.  Lots of compliments.
4.0,"Item is just as described and works great, only wish there was another vendor<br /> other than the useless company Amazon to purchase from"
4.0,"I love this hat -- not because it's a good hat, but because my wife looks super-crunchy in it when she's pushing our stroller around the neighborhood.  Yeah, I bought it for myself, thinking I'll have myself a nice sunshade that I can fold up in my pocket and OR stuff is the bomb, but in reality, I looked like a chick with a chick hat and a beard and was informed of such by said wife.  She thereafter commandeered it and rocks it out like every single day."
4.0,"pretty cute  looking, however, one button fall off before even trying it on"
4.0,"this is a great all around boot. It looks great with jeans, long skirts or short skirts. the heal is a nice height; high enough to give you some height, but not so tall your feet hurt by the end of a long day. the only thing i would say is a ""con"" is the leather sole... it is a bit slippery on wet ground/floors."
4.0,"A little skimpy on the sides - a little more on 'display' than<br /><br />more visible than<br /><br />More skimpy than I like  --more skin showing on the sides than I anticipated from the description and pictures.  They will suffice for day to day, undies.  The  price was  right and the quality of the fabric is fine....<br /><br />i"
4.0,"This is a really cute dress! I thought the gold buttons made it look cheap, so I took them off and put in different ones."
4.0,This tee shirt washes and dries well on a low heat setting it is true to the size my grandson loves this tee shirt he wears it all the time. It is of good quality materials.
4.0,"Very cute shirt just a bit large at the bottom, I would say maybe go a size down and it might fit a little bit better at the bottom. Overall good product for the price!"
4.0,"Was a gift from my husband, simply beautiful"
4.0,true to size nice look.
4.0,"I would have given this 5 stars, but I had to remove the tags due to them being hard and scratchy. This was a problem since the front and back look the same, so I sewed a line of thread into the back neck area that only shows in the inside, so I can tell front from back. That was a hassle, but otherwise the shirt is cute and comfortable. I am about 5'1"" around 115 lbs. The arms are long, as expected from  PattyBoutik. I wish they would put thumb holes in the sleeves for us petite women, so we don't have to roll the sleeves up."
4.0,"This bra is really great quality. I went ahead and picked one cup bigger and I usually wear B36 or C36, so I went with C38. It fits pretty well besides the shoulder straps. They make my neck so tense and I loosened them as much as I could. But I think you're in the clear if you just go a size up."
4.0,This pick was for my Dad on his 70th Birthday.Its was a great gift it was in a nice box an the pick was in a clear package.It put a smile on his face to for him that is a hard thing to do.I would recommend if you need a great little gift to buy it
4.0,I used this as my one personal bag for a 10 hour flight and it worked out great!  You can fold the top half over so it take sup less room so it fit perfectly under the seat.
4.0,"loved, thank you!"
4.0,These socks were very helpful in preventing shinsplints. After looking at the best way to prevent shinsplints these have slaves were cheaper cute with their pink stripes.
4.0,"These are well made but I had to return them because the buckles hit my ankle bone at just the right spot to rub them. After one day of wearing, my ankles both had raw spots to the point of bleeding. I'm still giving 4 stars because it may just be the way they fit me and they may not be that way for everyone. The reason for losing a star is they have very, very little traction on the bottom. Return was accepted and was simple."
4.0,After working out in these a few hundred times between the 3 I can say they are nice . They do get heavy when sweating. The material is durable and breathable. Not stretchy at all. They retain all the sweat
4.0,"These are lightweight and adjustable. They cost as much for two pairs as most other products cost for one. I did not find the nose piece comfortable because it is slashed so it grips. Instead, I pulled those off and then found the glasses to be quite comfortable. I need the reading pane while I'm wearing these and that works perfectly. I'm glad I was able to adjust them, as a result I feel this was a good purchase."
4.0,Looks like a bag
4.0,que no es bueno tiene que cortar la falda Pra uma persona basa
4.0,"Works very well, as expected."
4.0,As expected. Good pair of polarized glasses for the money.
4.0,"Nice looking case, but it doesn’t hold very many business cards."
4.0,"Very cute and have had several compliments. Did have an odd smell when I opened the package, but nothing different than other packages I have ordered. My only concern is how the two smaller straps are sewn into the purse. I'm not sure of how durable they will be or how 'heavy' my bag can be without putting too much stress on the straps. With such a large bag you tend to want to stuff everything in it! ;)<br />The bag does come with a shoulder strap which would work better for those 'pack it full' kind of days. Overall, I am pleased, especially for the price! Would buy this product again."
4.0,"Okay Santa brought these for my 3.5 year old who is above average height. The shirt fits fine and he loves them! The pants, however, are weird. I don’t know if I’d even call them pants. They are like capris; like shorts that are too long or pants that are too short. I’m probably going to have my mom hem them to shorts. He loves them so it’s a win!"
4.0,Super cute shirt and quality fabric.  It runs large so I have to return it.  Too bad they don’t have a smaller size.  I’d snap it up in a heartbeat if I could get it in a medium.
4.0,"I was delightfully surprised when I tried these MAREINE Vintage Cat Eye Sunglasses. I have a long narrow face shape and have difficulty finding frames that look good. Large framed sunglasses usually make me look like a fly. However, these trendy sunglasses look chic and almost very Jackie O. The frames are well made and the hinges are solid. They open and close tightly and smoothly. The polarized lenses offer substantial UV protection and eliminate glare. That is a 5600K LED light behind the lens in one of the pictures. They arrived with impressive packaging, so these would also be suitable as a gift.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you 😊 **"
4.0,"works well, biggest part for me is the hypoallergenic nature. I am allergic to all but a few metals, and have issues with belts touching my skin. this is all nylon and plastic, no issues. Seems to be holding up well."
4.0,"This is a lovely, feminine bracelet. The color is rose gold and is so delicate. It seems more appropriate for a young girl though as it is very small."
4.0,"for the price, is some very cute lingerie. i ordered the small and the cups of the bra were still too loose, so if you have b cups, i wouldnt recommend it.<br />i love the bottom though"
4.0,Good gloves durable to withstand a lot of abuse
4.0,"A very nice addition to my Detroit Apparel collection. The shirt runs slightly large, but not so bad that its an issue. Very soft material. I would buy this product again."
4.0,My first impression of the boots is that they seem very well constructed and are very comfortable. I haven't used them yet because still been a bit cold for myself. But I'm excited to try them.
4.0,Very cute addition to boots
4.0,Fits and looks great but it's mostly rubber and will get hot fast!!
4.0,I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding. I got the purple one and its really pretty. The color is close to what is pictured. The dress is really really comfortable. I got a 2xl It fit true to size maybe just slightly a little big. It fit a little bigger in the arm pit area for me and I'm a 38D.
4.0,So. back story. I got my septum pierced a little more than 3 months ago now. the place I went put it piercing up too high so while it hurt less because they didn't go through cartilage its also up just high enough that typical piercing hurt to wear for longer than 2 seconds. I'm learning that most septum rings have a Diameter of 8mm. some have a diameter of 10mm which is slightly more barable but still not perfect so I started my search for something bigger. that's how I got here. I don't hate these. They are comfortable and get the job done of being super simple. The reason its got a 4 star is because they are hard to close to the boing that I have been wearing it for 3 days now with the hinge in the slip of sin in my nose because that's the only way I can get it to look like its closed. Its annoying but 100% better than wearing a 8mm ring.<br /><br />Update. I got it to close.
4.0,"I am 5 foot 6, 130-135.  Bought a large just to be safe, from advice on other reviews. That seems to be a good size for me. I want my clothes to be  comfortable, this fits the bill.  It is super cute, as pictured. I like the material. The material is a stretch dress shirt type blend. I would expect it to wear well.  I did buy petticoat to go under it for fullness, it would be ok without."
4.0,"Very pretty earrings, but larger than I was expecting so pay attention to the dimensions. Because they are so large, I won't wear them all the time! But they are very pretty and very very light!! I was going for a &#34;Joanna Gaines&#34; aesthetic and I think these fit the bill!!"
4.0,"It actually looks like the picture! The beige underneath the lace is a bit see through, but overall it wasn’t too bad, although for the price I expected a little more."
4.0,"The bust sizing was too tight but the overall dress was amazing. I was so bummed it didn't work for me. I got a large. I'm 5'3 and 170#. I usually wear a 36dd bra, large in most all tops or XL for loose fit, and med bottoms.<br /><br />I would order a XL but by the waisting notes the waist would be too big though the length wasn't much longer."
4.0,Love the way this is made.  It is very pretty and easy to wear.
4.0,"I bought these for both of my daughters - one medium, one large. Neither fit, despite my daughter's being very different shapes. The top gapes on both of them. And READ THE FINE PRINT ON RETURNS! They can charge me a 50% restocking fee AND I have to pay to ship it back. Nope. No thanks. Just steer clear unless you KNOW that this item fits your kiddo!"
4.0,It is a little too small...... otherwise great
4.0,"Good product.  Better than the short old rusty metal one I’ve had laying around for ever, especially now that my mobility and flexibility are limited.  Searched long to find my deal but this one was it and I haven’t been disappointed."
4.0,"I loved the material it's nice and thick.  The only thing i didn't like is it was kind of short, standing up it was find but once you sit down it rolls up in the back, if it was just a few inches longer it would be perfect. For reference i'm 5'3"" 168lbs 34DD, i ordered a Large."
4.0,For some reason the bed took a wild to come but once I got it and opened it it was OK. The reason why I came in at four stars is because it was a little small but on the flipside the bag is very very durable and it feels strong enough for me to use as a carry-on when I go on the plane
4.0,Really like this shoe.. Nice color- doesn't feel like you are walking on the ground. Good support for a flat. Wish you had in more color options
4.0,Good quality shirt just what i ordered fits good and good shirt for a small price. Order one you wont be disappointed.
4.0,"Very small in the boobs, even with an XL. If you have a chest, not recommended.  It was really really soft though. Very comfortable material."
4.0,Very cute. Got as gift for friend.
4.0,Good purchase<br /><br />Thanks
4.0,"I purchased this brand of open front cardigan after ordering one of the TWINTH cardigans also sold on Amazon. I like the TWINTH, but this fabric is softer and it fits a little bit better. This is a $15 top so I wasn't expecting high quality, but it's good enough for Saturday breakfast or going to the movies. Lightweight, comfy, drapes well and covers my butt. Just what I wanted!<br /><br />I've only washed and worn once so I don't know how well it will hold up."
4.0,Works well...makes breathing with a mask much easier.
4.0,"Very fashionable set that can go with with any contrasting color. The ties themselves are of an O.K. quality. They will last you a while if you properly store and take care of them. It has a glossy finish to it, and the stitching is very precise. I would recommend this set for any occasion. It comes in two compact boxes, and each item is wrapped individually with plastic. no items were damaged or wrinkled. I am very satisfied with this purchase.<br /><br />Disclaimer, I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have no affiliation with its company or any of its members. My intention was to be completely unbiased on the issue while providing a decent feedback and background on the product."
4.0,"I got this for a friend and she loved it. It's better than what I expected, given how cheap it is."
4.0,"Very cute dress. I'm 5'4&#34; 140lb 36C, and the M fits good."
4.0,Very comfortable and great value for the price I paid I will definitely be buying another pair ‼️
4.0,Not as full as I thought it would be but works under her vintage dresses to provide the fullness.
4.0,Comfy top. Purchased for jeans day Friday at work but have worm during the week with slacks.
4.0,"Bought L and S size,  S size fit as the L size"
4.0,I liked it but it didn't quite fit... The other reviewers said it fit to small so I chose a larger size than normal and that was too big. I would just go with your normal size. Other than that it's cute & I'm disappointed it didn't work out!!
4.0,"Bought this to go with some camo pants.....the sweater fits perfectly my only negative is that the sleeves are more like 3/4 length.  they are not long like in the picture.  im a size xs sometimes a s and the arms are pretty short.  But other then that, i really do like the sweater"
4.0,So stinking cute but the size says for 2-4 year old and its clearly for a 4 year old. Bottom of boot says size 8 so why not list on site as size 8?
4.0,"These seem a slight bit thin, but the size is accurate and the stitching is sturdy.  I like that the sleeves have thick elastic bands.  And the colors are great!"
4.0,nee to adjust band great watch
4.0,"Nicely made, heavy material. Very large fit."
4.0,"The leotard is nice. However, keeping the skirt tied properly is a major pain in the butt. So ultimately my daughter, who is a girly girl, gave up on wearing it at all."
4.0,"Very nice bracelet.  Heavier metal than i thought. But for larger frame people such as my self. I am unable to stretch to fit my wrist without fear of bending out of shape. So, I gifted to some one else."
4.0,"I plan to wear this dress to a wedding shower.  Soft fabric, cute, and casual.  I ordered a size up from my usual due to the size chart, and it's probably good I did. I will wear something under it to contain the jiggles because it shows every little bulge.  I think the solid colors are cotton, but the florals are a poly/spandex blend, so the bodice and waist sort of cling  to your body.  The bottom is flowy.  It meets or exceeds my expectations."
4.0,"comfortable, fit well.  great eye protection for biking.  can get fogged up on more humid days"
4.0,Doesn’t really look like the picture. But it does the job.
4.0,"Not exactly what I expected but I like it and it fits pretty well, my boobs are kind of large so the straps make them stand out a bit more but it's almost perfect. I got exactly what I paid for."
4.0,"Dress fits well. I’m 145 and 5’5. I usually wear a small. Small fit okay, but I prefer it to be a little looser so I kept the medium.<br />However, the fabric pills after one wearing.<br />Cute if you just want it to wear around the house or for errands. I bought it for work."
4.0,Great glasses great prices seems to be a little smaller than others
4.0,I really like these shirt stays. Keeps my shirt nice and tucked. However I think these would be a 5 star product if each length could be adjusted instead of only the bottom section. Otherwise they're nice.
4.0,"Fit as expected. Love the color. Material is cheap, but for the price, can't beat it."
4.0,Great hat just runs slightly small even the xxl fits more like a xl but for the money I can’t complain
4.0,"Dress for my wife , she looked very beautiful and the dress complimented her curves.. very nice dress and comfortable , plus affordable. Plenty of compliments. Thank You!"
4.0,the fit is fine  the price is good
4.0,"The glasses are good quality and delivered with a great protective boxes. The glasses are larger than expected to fit the face of a little girl, it is more suited for a young teenager."
4.0,I'm a bigger guy and it fit me almost 300 lbs. so if your afraid it's to small don't worry. Looks great also.
4.0,"I really like the shape and color, but it was too small."
4.0,"This is exactly what I wanted, a simple cover-up to wear while in the kitchen. It is not a heavy fabric, but it is pretty and practical."
4.0,"I loved this dress as soon as i held it in my hands. The dress looks amazing on my pear shaped body. I ordered small for my 125 lbs and 5'2&#34; frame. It fits perfectly.  For the price i paid its a beautiful dress with good, expensive looking material. I took away one star because the dress had a rip. Anyways, i am returning it and getting another one right away hoping that it would be perfect."
4.0,"Received my dress today, it was too small. I don't think it's true to size. I have no complaints about the dress, it's beautiful. Instead of returning it, I blessed someone with it. So all is not lost."
4.0,I ordered a small and I'm about 125 pounds. They are a little loose around my ankles but otherwise they fit well. One thing I don't like is the seam at your hips is a little too high for my body and it looks like my butt is supposed to be an inch higher since the seam is on my lower back.
4.0,NOT BAD A LITTLE TOO ORANGEY
4.0,"Super cute !! A bit smaller and flatter than expected - probably not worth 20 bucks, but a cute gift"
4.0,The style is just a tad more formal/mature than I expected but overall very happy with the purchase.
4.0,I'm giving these a four because I love the height and the material. The somewhat large comment is honestly just my body type. I a abnormally skinny so everything is large on me. But other than that I love these boots.
4.0,Very heavy for a keychain. It would be unwise to put this on a carkey with other heavy keychains as it would mess up the key slot in the car. Inscription is blurry in some places like an image that was shrunken too far. Design is legible though and would make a quality gift.
4.0,I love the colors but you should work on the fit of the cover because these make it just a tad bit difficult to turn the bevel and that is really how you control everything on the watch.
4.0,"Beautiful outfit, but it is very thin."
4.0,"If you have a larger backside, get the largest size you can get. Other than that I love it"
4.0,They are cute but they are stiff shoes. I don’t think I could wear the for more than an hour
4.0,Good quality and I liked the zip up
4.0,I just received this bra and I am wearing it for the first time.  I have never had a comfort/sports bra before so I don’t have anything to compare it to.  The fabric is  very soft and stretchy. I’m a 38 C and the fit is pretty good with the pads in.  Slight uni-boob but I think that is to be expected with these kind of bras.  I purchased this bra because I am going for a scan and I can’t have any metal in my clothing.  Hope this helps.
4.0,"They look just like the photo but are bigger than I thought.  Well, better seen that way.  They are pretty."
4.0,pretty nice very comfy.I like them a lot !
4.0,"These are pretty decent overall. I have noticed that there are some threads coming out of the ends of the fingers. They are staying intact however. I thought they were going to come unsewed, but after several washings they are holding up just fine."
4.0,"Very pretty. Colors are not really vibrant or crisp, but it isn’t very expensive. I use it for working out."
4.0,I Like the dress i should have gotten xx large.
4.0,"Granddaughter likes them. They will last about a year with casual wearing. This is the second Old West I've gotten her. Materials are embossed plastic so the surface scuffs off. Since she out grows them in about a year, okay until she can wear a pair longer. Then I will get her a real leather pair."
4.0,good undershirt for softball jersey...wears good will buy again
4.0,Really comfy. Don't dry though they shrink up after a couple of washes. :)
4.0,"These are really beautiful earrings. My only problem with them is they came with very small backs. One of them came out of my ear in the shower. Luckily, it didn't go down the drain so, I put them up until I can find bigger backs."
4.0,Very comfy. Great fit! Will probably be getting another. :)
4.0,"Nice, very thin fabric"
4.0,Fits perfectly.  I bought this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. Perfect for summer/spring weather.
4.0,Good looking and versatile! Gets compliments often!
4.0,"bought this jersey for my grandson for Christmas, it appears well made and fits a little big but with the chest plate the extra is okay. colors are bright, my grandson loved it. would buy item again"
4.0,"These are fine but, they do roll when I sit as tights are known to do.<br />Other than that annoying issue, they're good tights."
4.0,"I'm thin (5'3"", 111 lbs) but with a belly. I always look pregnant 😔 so I like flowy dresses that hides it. I read reviews & thought this would hide it. It doesn't. That's the only reason for the 4 stars, vs 5. The tie dye print is really cute, exactly as pictured. The material is so soft & It's not as see-through as expected."
4.0,Got this for my wife after she kept taking mine away from me. She loves it.
4.0,This dress fit nicely and is made of quality material. I ordered the Medium and it fit everywhere else but since I have a bigger bust it didn't hang off my shoulders quite as nicely as pictured.
4.0,"It's pretty tight to the face, the first time I wore it, I found it was a little hard to breathe. But once I stretched it out it worked perfectly. I bought this while I was unable to find facemasks during the covid crisis."
4.0,"Purchased them for my daughter. Cute. However be aware that the material is cheap. I had to repair the stitching on them, So she could wear them."
4.0,Would've preferred that the belt was wider.
4.0,Very nice product.  There is a seam but real slight. The inside is not printed.  Great color.  Already washed a few and they wash up nice.  I am happy with this purchase and thank the seller for including an extra.
4.0,"Nice overall watch! I like to have MANY different watches and shoes, since those are the finish-out items for the nearly anything you wear. I WILL absolutely use this seller again.."
4.0,"Love the size/color of this bag. Exactly what I was looking for. The only downfall is it's not for left handed people (such as myself). When I put it on and then swing it forward, the zippers are located at the bottom causing it to be annoying to get stuff out of. I have to take the bag off my body to access something. It's perfect for right handed people, though."
4.0,They are good shoes
4.0,Too short on the sides
4.0,"I like the color, fit and quality. Only dislike is back of net has to be Velcroed together. Hard to do in turkey hunting situation"
4.0,"My daughter loved it but the material is a little strange and you can’t dry it cause it will<br />Shrink, runs a little small I would size up"
4.0,Well made a very pretty bag.
4.0,It you want a different type of sunglasses than there’s are it. However I will say it does feel cheap to some degree though.
4.0,"So far, so good! Not good with glasses though, they still fog up. The mask comes up a bit higher than in the product photo. Overall, a pretty ingenious product."
4.0,Beware run a little small
4.0,The dress is really comfortable. It seems to be run a bit large.
4.0,"These are so comfortable!  But, BEWARE, don't put them in the dryer.  I ruined some by doing that.  The little rubber &#34;traction&#34; things on the bottom don't hold up so well in a hot dryer."
4.0,"This apron is quite big, thus helps in covering most of the front area of the body. The only reason I gave it four stars is that it seems to be a little big near the chest/ neck area, resulting in giving a loose look instead of fitting. But overall it serves the purpose."
4.0,It was too big and to long. The material was nice and it flowy great for the summer.
4.0,"Fit well everywhere but the cut of the bottom area. The bottom is cut like a bikini, but I got this suit to cover more in that area. I really liked the cut in the front, but sadly I returned."
4.0,Love these necklaces my only issue is length of the chain.
4.0,At 1/4 price
4.0,Beautiful earrings just too small for my ears. They almost went through my ears. If my holes were smaller they would have been good.
4.0,Nice white hat with a ton of interesting graffiti.will fit a large head easily.shippedfast came neat and clean in plastic sealed bag.
4.0,"They are a xmas gift, but as far as I can tell I like the way they look."
4.0,I thought the chain would be a bit heavier but other than that this tie chain is exactly as I thought it would be. Nice enough and you can't beat the price.
4.0,"These gloves are very nice and warm but beware, they are very small.  Originally ordered for my mother who has arthritis in her hands, she would never have been able to get them on.  They fit me but I have small thin hands and wrists.  As for the gloves, they are very warm and cozy."
4.0,"I'm very happy with them, and I love the little gift box. Not perfect, but definitely what I paid for."
4.0,The glasses are ok and they look pretty good.
4.0,Pretty much what we were looking for and expected.
4.0,"Pretty, but its too big on my wrist. Wearing as an ankle bracelet. Now i have to find another bracelet to fit my small wrists"
4.0,"It's great for going out to the could for an hour. Not as thick as I wanted though. Overall, great buy."
4.0,Color is perfect but the arm's are a little tight.  Looks well made. I haven't had a chance to wear it since the heat started up.
4.0,"I love this dress. I gave four stars because I didn't like that the pockets.  The pockets sits a little higher than I would like.  Outside of that, the dress is great. I will be wearing it."
4.0,Wish the fabric was a little softer
4.0,"A little long,  but otherwise great.  Had to have them shortened and my husband is 6 foot tall."
4.0,"I've had this dress for a couple months and have worn it multiple times. The cut off the top is a little wonky, so you might see a bit of bra. The armpit area is fairly large and does stretch a little. The dress is also on the long side and will get longer as you wear it, but shrinks back up when you wash it."
4.0,"Arrived quickly, got a day early. Too cool! Dress made well, kind of a rayon type fabric. Very long, looks like it can keep sweat away at the beach. Color is a print, inside of fabric is white."
4.0,A great hat for the price.  Don't expect it to be as nice as a 6x Stetson but price for what you get is worth it.
4.0,"Bought it for ym wife, she loves it, pretty good detail too, looks nice on lapel of her leather jacket."
4.0,"Delightful trousers... though I know cordouroy is hardly in fashion for 20 somethings these days, I've adored and admired the fabric for as long as I can remember, yet it's probably been since my age was in the single digits since I had a pair of my own! These were marked down on sale for barely $8 - how could I resist? Good length - I'm 5'7'' with average length legs, and good fit around the waist, though perhaps a slight bit larger than expected (however, this is a GOOD thing; this fabric is destined to shrink if mistreated - or even if treated right! so don't worry if there's a slight excess to begin with; with every wash they will sadly, but slightly, diminish in size.)<br />Thanks muchly to Buffalo David Bitton - new experience with this designer and beyond pleased!"
4.0,"Great shirt for the price, just size up a size or two depending on how you normally wear tee shirts."
4.0,Good product for the  price.
4.0,I bought this blouse on sammy dresses for  little over 12 bucks<br />it a nice blouse i  ordered one size up
4.0,"In Black the large was too small, in yellow the x-large was a little big. So losing a start for the awkward sizing but this suit is sexy as hell and by far my favorite suit I have worn in my adult life."
4.0,"Because this is a one-size-fits-all item, I was worried that it wouldn't fit me (5'4&#34;, 155 lbs, 38B).  I'm happy to say that it JUST fits.  Since I'm on a cycle of losing weight, this shirt will fit me for quite some time.  It hits just below my waist, which is what I was hoping for.  I'm short-waisted, though, so taller gals or those with longer upper torsos may have different results.<br /><br />The fabric is soft, nicely woven and slightly see-through.  The doubled pockets would allow one to go bra-less except that they sit too low.  So, proper undergarments of your choice are required.<br /><br />I ordered the pink one.  It is not as deep pink as shown.  Instead, it is a very delicate, powdery pink.  Very pretty.  Perfect for Spring and Summer!"
4.0,"Great color (rose), super soft and warm. The cut is a little bit bulky and short but for the price I kept it. Very cozy and toasty."
4.0,"Nice, thin and love the color."
4.0,"Perfect size, thank You again!!!!!"
4.0,It was given as a gift and I was very pleased with the jersey.
4.0,"Got it for my Mom. It runs small but as I saw that in reviews, I bought a size larger. She enjoys it and it wasn't a bad value"
4.0,"Gorgeous dress and colorful. However, the quality check did not do a great job. The sewing machine caught the side seam. It sewed it as a fold. Anyone who sews knows this can happen if both layers of fabric are not smoothed out while sewing. Great dress for larger cup sizes. I am 5' 6&#34; ad it hits my ankles. The sleeves are loose around my arms. I bought an XL. There is a slight pull at the buttons in the bodice but the bit of extra material running behind the buttons keep everything hidden. I wear a 36DD to 36G/H. I do like that the dress makes me appear smaller on top. I bought the red dress but its more of a melon color leaning to a dark coral than red. I get a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"My husband does a lot of contract work.  That means that he needs to have access to his phone quite often for business as well as personal contacts.  Let's see how these gloves worked out.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE GLOVES LIKE?<br />These gloves are black as in the photo.  They are a combination of nylon, flocked surface, and faux leather on the tips of the fingers.<br /><br />LINING<br />These are lined in a nice soft fleece type lining which is part poly and part rayon, which is very very nice.<br /><br />CLIPS<br />These have clips to put the gloves together so they can dry and not get lost apart from each other.<br /><br />POCKETS<br />There are two zipper pockets on the backs of each hand.  (one on each)  These fit a credit card in them.  The zipper is nice and seems to be water resistant, if not water proof.<br /><br />CUFF BAND<br />There is an adjustable cuff band made from a tightly woven nylon webbing.  The buckle is easy to adjust to make these tight to keep cold and snow out (although they have elastic too in the wrist).<br /><br />TOUCHSCREEN?<br />These gloves are really great until we get to the touchscreen part.  They work, but it is so much fiddling to get one process to happen, that I find that taking the glove off saves time and frustration.  In the case of my husband he had some embarrassing phone calls made by mistakes to customers trying to use his smartphone with these on.<br /><br />WARM?<br />These are very warm gloves.  They work well even in pretty cold temperatures with some wind too.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE FIT?<br />My husband has medium sized hands and these fit very well.  The fingers are not too long, but they are not too short either.  A tiny bit shorter and they would be perfect.  It is rare for a glove to fit that well though so that is not a deal breaker.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Great warm gloves which keep hands dry, have storage and a clip to keep them together when not in use, these are not too great with touchscreens.  Still a nice pair of gloves.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I prefer to say these are four and a half stars because they are not quite five due to the touchscreen lack of performance.  Just based on being a glove, they are great.  If you have to have touchscreen performance, these might not work for you."
4.0,"Very cute, got lots of good complements, but bottoms fell and breaks easily"
4.0,"Beautiful,gift"
4.0,Love these slippers my feet look like 🍕 pizza. Needs better padding on the bottom. #pizzafeet
4.0,Was good but I should of gotten a medium instead of a small but I'll work through it...... I am about 140lbs with a c Cup
4.0,"I am 5'6"", 190 lbs.  I wear a size 14 and ordered the XL, but the suit was a bit too big for me.  It also came in like a space saving bag that all the air had been sucked out of and the bottoms of the suit had weird marks from the amount of time it had been in the bag.  Overall the suit was cute and the quality was great for the price.  I'd definitely recommend but be sure to size down."
4.0,Great prop. I used this with the Horror Hood at Halloween. It helped sell the outfit and scared young and old alike. Looks real enough...in the dark. Relatively durable and the price is right.
4.0,"I love the separated compartments for money, and all the card slits. Only down side is the texture is different than what I was expecting. I bought it as a gift so, i am hoping he likes it!"
4.0,"Would have been 5 stars but the sizing was smaller than expected.<br />Actually, a beautiful cardigan type vest.  Nicely made, better than I expected BUT too small for me."
4.0,"These pearls are a lovely color, nice weight, delicate but functional clasp. They are a gift for my niece and she will love them!!"
4.0,Smaller than I realized but nice quality.
4.0,"So cozy and warm, but it hangs fairly loose around my legs. I wish the material was better, it's starting to pill. There are also two bubbly gathers in the front that I don't love."
4.0,"Size is small, looks good but material is thin. Still recommend it, 4 star only"
4.0,I am a 10 in woman ordered a large fits good.......... no support for tummy though
4.0,"This top is really cute! I normally wear a medium to large, the large is a bit big for me but it fits well without feeling too baggy. I can wear this with leggings and it covering my bum. I wear my beige bra with this shirt since it has lacy sleeves but I could still see my bra straps so I would recommend a strapless bra with this. Since the label says hand wash, I washed this wash cold cycle in my washer and hung it to dry and it doesn't appear to have shrunk at all."
4.0,worn to a convention that richard dreyfuss was supposed to attend.  got lots of compliments.
4.0,"Seems true to size, great color intensity, hopefully with soften with washings, but neck is a bit loose. I wear with turtlenecks but if it was for my hubby, he'd be disappointed!"
4.0,"Lovely casual dress!!!! Order a size down. Very classy. You can dress it up with a scarf, or keep it casual with your converse, are sandals. Great dress!!!!"
4.0,"Product worked fine, I use it to participate in Ragnar races. Light weight and easy to adjust fit. Just make sure you open it up and air it out well before using. I made the mistake of not airing it out and the smell was overwhelming while I was trying to run in it, I ended up using someone else’s for the first race I brought it to as a result."
4.0,Very attractive addition to my collection
4.0,Good wallet for the price. Functions as a wallet. It's a wallet!
4.0,These shirts are nice and what you would expect but they run small. My son is a 14 and we ordered him a 14-16 and it was too small. If we kept it and ended up accidentally drying it it would be a belly shirt on him lol and thats obviously not the were going for ha. So I would at least order up 1 size and if I remember correctly these are 100% cotton so your definitely going to get some shrinking to begin with.  Hope you found this helpful! Have a wonderful day!
4.0,It is nice. Fits well comfortable.
4.0,happy with the purchase of this dress.
4.0,The dress came looking exactly as expected but it was too small and it was an XL. I wear Lrg normally.
4.0,Pretty good but fit a lil tight
4.0,Good and smooth fit
4.0,"Pretty nifty. Quality feels cheap, the fabric is sort of thin plastic-y and crinkley, but they get the job done. I like that the bags are water resistant, good for carrying wet items or toiletries that can potentially spill."
4.0,Dress was too tight across the chest and I couldn't go a size up cause it was already too long in the sleeve and length
4.0,Love this jacket. Great for fall weather
4.0,"Pretty ring wanted a little bling, not too much this ring fit the bill. Wish the rings came in half sizes, as it's a little big.<br />Still will wear and enjoy."
4.0,"Me quedo un poco grande pero fue culpa mia pues queria que me quedara un poco suelta y pedi una talla mas.  Pero realmente se agradece la tabla de medidas que tienen, ayuda mucho."
4.0,This was exactly as pictured and expected.  It looks great on my new red SUV.
4.0,arrived later then expected. very thin material but fits and as described. not absorbent at all
4.0,A little big and material is really thin
4.0,Perfect scientific ugly sweater for party!
4.0,"these are super comfortable, but on the left boot the heel guard (no idea if this is the right term, but basically the piece that goes around the heel to keep it upright that is covered in fabric) sticks out too far and rubs on my ankle. kind of bummer because these boots are so cute and comfortable except for that. the right one doesn’t have it, though, so i’m not sure if this pair is just defective or what."
4.0,"Very soft, basic sports bras.  I love wearing them for running."
4.0,I ordered these in a small for my daughter. 110 lb. 5ft<br />They are definitely high waisted which is great ( no butt crack shows). They aren’t see through from being too tight. She said they are soft. She complains that they hurt her stomach and my complaint with the pink ones is that from a distance they look like body paint. 😂
4.0,"This is a really nice tote.  It's strong enough and big enough for me to add my laptop, my lunch, a book or two and some folders.  The design is really pretty too.  It's a good quality bag, the one drawback for me is that it is floppy.  I would have like it better if it could stand up on its own."
4.0,Great product for true to size just didn't work for my body type.
4.0,"Purchased this to try for a little white elopement dress. It fit great and was very comfortable, but in white it was super see-through and I would not recommend unless that's the vibe you're going for. I'm pasty white colored and even with ""nude"" undies it wasn't gonna work for me. I am a little more modest than that and didn't have time (or the desire to spend the money on a $25 dress) to have a thicker slip sewn in. Quick return though!"
4.0,Comfortable and looks good. Runs a little short.
4.0,Awesome for the price. There is a very strange machine oil type smell to it though and it is pretty itchy.
4.0,I do like this watch a lot. It has a larger face than I expected. I suspect I should have measured or paid more attention to the description. It is easy to read and rather stylish.
4.0,"I wore these for kickboxing.  I like the fit and length when you first put them on, but they definitely ride up when you move (though I haven't found any that don't yet).  The material is fairly thin, maybe even a bit see through, but I still felt comfortable wearing them as a short.  They are comfortable except for the riding.  The waistband was a bit high in front (though still below belly button), but perfect in back.  I'm 5'6, 130 lb and got a small.  Wondering if an extra small would be tighter and prevent the short riding up.  They aren't perfect, but for $25, they are probably the best you will find."
4.0,"Liked that it fit based off the size chart, however would have like more color options."
4.0,"Comfortable special event dress. Love it. Looks much more expensive that it is. Has a very feminine silhouette, great way to show off curves."
4.0,"Its hard to get this material just right in every area, but for the most part its wearable."
4.0,"It's VERY thin, but not see through. I am not blessed in the chest area and it's not too low, I was worried about that. It's a great, simple, every day dress! The color and shape was as expected. It does not stretch though, so size up if you're concerned."
4.0,Great fit very comfortable!
4.0,"I bought the grey at a great price.  While they are a little large in the waist, I'll be taking them in.  The fabric is thick and not see through.  Even though they are more $ I'm ordering the navy."
4.0,LOVE IT USA
4.0,The tights came promptly and we're as expected.
4.0,"I love the coat, it is very pretty, the design is lovely I wish it was wool or cashmere since I generally prefer higher quality fabric than polyester, but the design was irresistible to me so I got it anyway and I'm happy I did. It is heavy, I guess because it is fully lined and a thick fabric which gives it a nice hang, but beware that it has substantial weight even for a coat. The sizing seemed true to size. I'm usually a Medium or Large depending on the brand and I ordered a Large. It fits nicely in the waist with a bit of extra room, and while I can fasten the top over my breasts it leaves unsightly gaps over my chest area which is not flattering at all. I would love to be able to fasten it up all the way, but I will have to wear it either completely open or only fastened at the waist. I realize this may not be an issue for a lot of women as I am quite busty, but I thought it was worth warning other busty ladies to watch out for that when deciding to purchase or not. As for warmth I don't think I would trust it to keep me toasty in freezing weather, (perhaps with layers of warm sweaters) but if you're dealing with somewhere around 45-60 degree range without strong wind you will likely find it suitable for keeping you from getting a chill it hasn't been cold enough here yet for me to give it a test."
4.0,The quality of this item for the price is spot on. It's durable but lightweight. I would give five stars but I feel life the sizing is a little off. I ordered the largest size and it's still a little narrow in the bust/chest. Someone with a smaller chest or narrower bust area would likely find the fit is perfect.
4.0,my only problem wiz those till now that the last part of the chain near the fluffy ball  is silver not gold like the rest of the chain
4.0,Good quality for the price- feel a little fragile. Hard case was a nice add-on. I intend on using these for occasional night driving and expect them to help with glare.
4.0,Love the material. It feels high quality and wicks sweat in the Louisiana heat.
4.0,A little big but otherwise a nice warm Halloween costume for my kid.
4.0,"just as my expectation, $1 each, not so bad. if you looking for gift for your friend, just order it online. simple, you don't need to come to NY  to buy them :)"
4.0,"It's more of a wallet for me. I alreesdy have a smartphone Wallet I paid a lot for, I'm not ready to put it away yet. I bought it because I loved the colors and the designs on it. Arrived quickly, doesn't seem like it's made out of real leather for the price, but it has a nice fabric cover on the inside and looks pricy. it's very pretty. I like it very much."
4.0,"Used this as an accessory for my dress that I bought from angel fashion for my prom, btw check them out! 😂 Anw, this necklace is visualy nice, but it is too lightweight, I was expecting it to be heavier. It actually feels a bit cheap, but looks nice. I just don't feel like it's worth 11$  anyway, still THANK YOU!💓"
4.0,"I bought jacket for my trip to Alaska. Have not used it yet, but it fits good. Very comfortable and nice pockets!"
4.0,Works well as described but sizing is a bit off for me but this totally depends on hand size.  However in retrospect I would go down a size from what you measure if you are really using this as a driving glove rather than a fashion statement.
4.0,Good quality shirt and great print.
4.0,"The purse is pretty and functional. My only complaint is that the shoulder straps edged started to unravel. I did try to glue them back but they did not hold up to the heat or rain. The purse lasted for 5 months before this happened. Very cute purse though. There must be some kind of protectant to apply to prevent the targeting of the shoulder straps. With all of that being said, I will most likely but another."
4.0,"These are bold and fun! I love the Cateye look of these. I only wear cateye style, so it was fun to find something a bit more oversized. The price reflects the quality... cheaper and thinner than most sunglasses I own. But I don't think that affected the fit or overall look. I love them!"
4.0,Seems to be well made but a bit bigger and too shiny for my wear. I gave it to a family member.
4.0,Too small for my husband's feet. He's a size13 wide and the size 13 we received is definitely too small. Feels more like a 12 or 12.5 size. His heel was out of the shoe.  Had to return. Other than that the shoe is very nice looking. We wanted an easy shoe to put on and off while camping and that was more supportive than sandals or flip flops.
4.0,"Everything was great, except the zipper for the largest pocket is difficult to close and open completely. A little redesign of that area would be better."
4.0,"My older daughter love it I just add one more line of black material cause was somehow short,otherwise dress is exactly like in the picture ."
4.0,runs small but is a really great glove...returned and will order another size.
4.0,stone catches on things sometimes
4.0,"Decent jewelry for price, used for my wedding."
4.0,I love mine! The only thing that isn’t great is cards are a little hard to get out of the slots. I struggled HARD CORE to get my drivers license out at the airport...thankfully they lady was nice and patient. I’ve stretched it out since then and don’t really have that problem anymore
4.0,Great shirt<br />The sizing is a bit off<br />I had to order a size up<br />Looks and feels great
4.0,"wanted something that could be dressy or casual, fits the bill"
4.0,"When I saw it online, I had to have it. I knew that ordering  a dress online without being able to try it on was a bit of a gamble, but it wasn't terribly expensive so I ordered it based on the photos and reviews that other girls had posted. So now that I've received it, I can tell you that I still love it, it's beautiful and very ladylike. The fabric is in no way stretchy, and I was surprised that getting over my head and shoulders was difficult. I was able to get it down over me though and it fit pretty well, once overcoming the initial difficulty of getting over my upper half. I added a belt, although a belt isn't necessary and I now feel like it looks better without one. This dress could easily be dressed up or down. I really like it even though the fit for me is not perfect. I ordered a size large. Lately in clothing I find I'm somewhere between a medium and large. I'm between 5'3 and 5'4 and I weigh around 155. I'm smaller up top, and bigger on the bottom. This is why I was surprised the upper half of the dress seemed a little hard to get on. I'm overall happy with my purchase. My family loves it and I got compliments right away. Smiles."
4.0,Good quality and fast shipping for the price. Colors are also good and the purple and black blend well together. You really cannot go wrong at this price
4.0,Bought for one occasion and it worked nicely for it.
4.0,Love it! just wished the little side chain that's for design was shorter because I would step on it sometimes.
4.0,"It is simple and compact though a bit small.  It has a great time display but a weak light.  If you are looking for a retro watch that is a good time keeper, this is the watch for you."
4.0,Fits very well bought for my mother's Funeral
4.0,Came very quickly.  I got a 5X (I can where 2x) and it is big but....I didn't want to chance it.  It fits around my knees (5'6&#34;) and will be great to go out with my best friend in matching butterfly dresses!  The material is a little rough but nothing I wouldn't get use to wearing.  I would recommend this to someone looking for something fun.
4.0,I love this one got it just as told
4.0,"Absolutely perfect for my wedding day. Only bad feed back is it does have a &#34;aged&#34; look than in the picture, but for me this is perfect!!! Also loved the little information on the line that comes in the box as well as the presentation put into your packaging thank you so much!"
4.0,VERY Beautiful outfit but it runs VERY LONG and one size larger. I had it altered to fit me.
4.0,"I really like the design on the mask, perfect for Christmas. This isn’t a very snug fitting mask, even with the metal piece on the nose. A plus is it uses a filter."
4.0,Runs large and the material is on thinner side. Looks good though.
4.0,"I love it, but gave it a 4 because it doesn't want to stay on my shoulders very well."
4.0,I got this shirt because I didn’t want to pay $70 for a name brand. Overall love this shirt but it did shed on my shirt I wore under it
4.0,"The fabric isn’t the softest, but not bad. I love the fit. It is long enough to cover my bum, but not frumpy. It will be a great quick layer to add to multiple outfits."
4.0,Only thing is the strings I restrung with different ribbons which looks better
4.0,Im happy with the product. I appears to be sturdy and will last me a while.
4.0,"Soft material and looks pretty.<br /><br />Sort of 'over-sized' so not really sexy, but the point is to stay warm without the old fashioned flannel PJ look"
4.0,"This night gown is incredibly soft. The light weight fabric feels great on your skin. However, this is not a gown I would wear around anyone but a spouse or lover as my daughter would not like to see my figure so we’ll outlined."
4.0,"Beautiful, Elegant, looks hundreads $$$.<br />Lovely dress that I got my wife for a Christmas dinner, BUT if you are a M/L, get XXL. They run very small."
4.0,Very high quality rich looking earrings!  They are bigger than I expected and fairly heavy.  They are beautiful and look great and I would definitely purchase more items from this seller.
4.0,"Really cute, but didn't fit my smartwatch"
4.0,Just what I wanted.  Looks great and easyh
4.0,"This is a pretty nice light weight coat.  I would say it runs a little large, I ordered a small and it feels big on me, not too big to wear, but it would have been nice if it was a little more fitted.<br /><br />The material is very soft and comfortable.  The coat itself is lightweight and perfect for spring.  It does not have any buttons and can only be closed when tied. It has ample pocket space and  I really like  the two inside pockets also.<br /><br />I think the only down side to this is it is a dog hair magnet so get your lint roller ready if you have pets.  It also gives off a very bathrobe vibe when tied."
4.0,I bought the xxl because i heard it shrunk i wear a xl normally it fits a little big but not to bad.  I love pink floyd so can't complain.
4.0,"I needed something that could tolerate every day stuff, cleaning kids pets work etc..  so for the price and you get more then one, I figured why not try it? Glad I did, I just wish there was half sizes"
4.0,"These do fit over my glasses well and are not heavy on my nose. I live out in the country our roads are two lane roads mostly so the light can be blinding ... these really help with that ... also, I am developing cataracts and have noticed that there are less halos around lights at night."
4.0,"Very soft. It fits like an old school sweatshirt. I haven't shrunk it yet so I hope it the size aligns more with a medium and not a large.<br /><br />UPDATE! Since a run through a wash and dry cycle, this sweatshirt fits perfectly. It's now a proper medium!"
4.0,Good quality but runs a little small.
4.0,Warps easy
4.0,Very pretty earrings.  They are a little heavy but when using a back that will support the stud it looks nice.
4.0,"These earrings were definitely a worthwhile purchase.  They arrived right before Christmas like I was hoping they would.  While wearing them, I have received many compliments and they really do look great.  I would definitely purchase more jewelry again."
4.0,"Nice casual top. Not too thick or too thin. I got a large . I am 5'7"", 160 lbs. Is not clingy."
4.0,"Not the most flattering of dresses but I am also pregnant. It is super comfy and thicker than I thought. The tie does not have any hooks to loop through which makes it a bit of a pain. The sit fine for me since I’m pregnant.<br /><br />The color isn’t my favorite (yellow/beige). Lengthwise, it is pretty long. Great for a spring dress to wear with tights/leggings"
4.0,"They were just fine. The last time I ordered these they were a much thicker of a weave, these are just like regular briefs. Would have<br />liked the thicker one's but I guess you don't carry those anymore.  Most places doe not have a size 5, so I am glad I could get this<br />smaller size."
4.0,It is a nice ring . It only comes in one size that is a size 13. The line in the middle of the ring is thin . But over all he liked it .
4.0,Dainty beauties
4.0,Item as stated...thanks again!
4.0,They do run slightly large but that's a plus with growing kids
4.0,"Good quality for the price, nice design, fit was stretchy- zipper was a bit tricky, and length was a bit too long."
4.0,"Clear vision on both snowy and sunny days, no foggy itself. But using as OTG, my glass is foggy sometimes"
4.0,Very cute set. My boyfriend's 5 year old son loved them and they looked fantastic.<br />They stayed on well and stayed in place. The only downside is that everyone of them has white on it so they must be cleaned after 1 use.
4.0,Like it. The material is slightly sheer.
4.0,"It was a gift, but they said they looked forward wearing it on the tennis court"
4.0,I knocked off a star because the layers are cut so unevenly; it’s all my OCD can notice. But I’m keeping them because you can’t beat the price point and let’s admit they’re pretty stinkin cute.
4.0,"I wish it stayed on my ear better, but I get loads of compliments on it!"
4.0,Nice brush. Keeps my tan Herschel looking like new.
4.0,Very nice shirt. No complaints
4.0,I usually wear a medium but got a large and it fits great!  I like a little more room in the hip area. It is very comfortable and I love it!
4.0,I really like my shoes very nice and comfortable thank you
4.0,"I really like these shirts and have one in every color! The only complaint I have are the buttons are not secured very well, a thread only goes through two of the holes, so they fall off very easily.<br />The color and the fit are excellent.<br />Received code for discount"
4.0,Nice backpack for laptop and other portable devices. Tested it in rain and no water goes through. It sits nicely on back. Space is kind of limited though to carry books and notes.
4.0,"very comfortable and cute. Not sure how long they will last, but can't complain for the price. I would buy like 10 more, all different colors."
4.0,This is a very pretty design looks exactly as it does on the picture it looks even better on the hand
4.0,Someone gave this to us as a gift. We love it and it fit well even with cloth diapers. The legs are a little short and it does roll at the ankles and wrists after washing. We hang dry our kids clothes so we did not have any shrinking.
4.0,"The Orchid Row's Lightweight Lace Trim travel scarf is a very lightweight wrap, but it is really large, much larger than a standard scarf. It is so large that I used it as a ""wrap dress"" for my daughters when we played dress up. It is a bit thin, and can be easily hung on something, but the lace trim is very nicely sewn and the texture is soft and light. It's not as comfortable used around the neck as a scarf because of it's size, but it's also usable as more of an over-the-shoulder wrap or around the waist as a swimsuit cover."
4.0,Love this clutch
4.0,"Nice cute hat but not adjustable and color look on the greenish side , but for the price it is not bad."
4.0,great gift for my niece
4.0,"I had to return these because I couldn't get the collar to lay down,  the collar is cute up, but it drives me nuts.<br />The tops are really well made, I bought blue and red, I wish they had worked for me"
4.0,"I prefer a relatively loose fit, so I usually order a M/L at 5'5 and weighing 150lbs. But I ordered a XXL in these shirts to get the loose fit I wanted. I'm satisfied with that fit and the material is light and stretchy to accommodate intense workouts."
4.0,Long enough she can wear without shorts underneath if she chooses. She liked the bird pattern on the dress. The red color makes it a great addition to her school wardrobe. This will get a ton of wear Spring to Fall.
4.0,Nice appearance. Shipped in plastic bag but arrived undamaged. Good buy for the price.
4.0,Serviceable hat. Keeps the sun out well. I didn't like the little metal tag so I cut it off. Now there are just a couple pointless little decorative rivets there.
4.0,Good evythight
4.0,Silky look. Fits nice
4.0,awesome just wish my doctor could have filled them.
4.0,"Love the design and material.  However, after first wear, on the 2nd wear the seams under the armpit came apart.  Luckily it is under the armpit so did not show.  Have to note that I ordered 4 others sweaters from Patty Boutik as well they they DO NOT have the same problem.  All well made and good design.  Just this one (the best looking one actually) did not hold up as well.  But overall I'm satisfy with the products I purchased."
4.0,So far they are great
4.0,I did the universal cup calculator it was larger around the band than expected. Other than that very cute
4.0,The quality was less than I expected but it’s a very cute gift for a little girl
4.0,I like it overall the only reason I can't wear it comfortably is that it's a little too big
4.0,Bought this for for our son and 2 son-in laws.  All were very pleased
4.0,SIZE XL!!! I'm normally a Medium!  I love this! It keeps we warm! And it's long enough to cover my butt :&#62;  I should have order a Large since I'm not layering much.
4.0,"Glasses are Stylish and look wonderful,<br />can't beat the price! Fast Delivery but could have been packaged better, came in a box no case, no wrapping<br />that's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5!"
4.0,They are cute. I like them a lot!
4.0,I ordered size 3T for my 3 year old daughter. She’s slender. Super cute. Shorts are a bit tight.
4.0,Cute but straps are tight. For narrow feet.
4.0,Fits great! High waistband and great material
4.0,"I have ordered a few items from Zenergy, I live every piece I've gotten. The black Onyx, I love, just as described in picture. And the bonus crystal pieces, are nice too. When I charge in the evening,with the selenite gem from order, I notice the difference. Thank You!"
4.0,This are true to size.  Very comfortable.  So comfortable I bought several.
4.0,The material could be a little better quality.
4.0,"I would not suggest to wear this in the late spring or early fall as I expected to due to this being warm, this is meant to be worn when its cold. Between 55-35 degrees. However this still a very solid bomber and it looks nice, feels nice, and fits nice. Perfect for use during the school year."
4.0,Case is awesome. Phone was dropped and unharmed so did it's job. Case is broken not though so have to order another.
4.0,"Good gloves, keeping my hands warm"
4.0,Great small bag. Only criticism would be the strap has some pretty terrible stitching. Not a huge issue but worth noting.
4.0,Asian sized so I bought a 5X. It's a nice blouse for the price.
4.0,My nephew loved this and it is a durable material
4.0,The prior reviews indicated a somewhat small fit so I ordered a Large.  The Large works well for me and I usually wear a Medium.  The design is very nice and the colors are vivid.
4.0,Cute but definitely not 35 mm. Much longer.  My hair is getting caught in it.
4.0,"Very stylish, however one of the clasp is difficult to remove from the Fitbit once it's on. Otherwise from that small issue. I am so in love with this bangle"
4.0,"The bands are great,sometimes they unsnap by themselves but overall they look pretty!"
4.0,"Nice surprise!  I was looking for a lightweight blue purse that would fit everything I carry.  This is exactly what I wanted.  Lightweight, holds large sun glasses, kleenex, wallet, pills, pen, small notebook, a bottle of water and a bag og munchies.  The only thing that has annoyed me is one zipper is constantly getting the material in it and then it's difficult to zip up.  I've learned to put my finger under it when zipping and that seems to work."
4.0,"loved my first strap, and bought another for a vacation, took out of package and ends were sewn almost shut, that I could not get sunglasses into them! tried to cut ends and it ruined them!"
4.0,Ordered these for my daughter and she wore them every single day! Good quality and go with anything!
4.0,Great accessory to my daughters steam punk outfit. One of the spikes did fall off but it was not a big deal but is why it didn't get a 5 star.
4.0,I'm not used to wearing a girdle but it is comfortable and fits good. It fits just like shown in the picture. I've tried it going out for 3 hrs and had no trouble at all. Not an everyday garment for me but on occasion the extra support is good.<br />I ordered one size larger than belly measurment
4.0,"These are fine and all, I guess.  The waist on them are REALLY HIGH.  I'm 5'2 and 90lbs; the waist fits almost all the way up to under my boobs!  It's a ""whatever"" for me since I just wear them with a loose and long covering shirt.  The length is fine (a bit on the long side, but I'm short so that is expected).  They are soft and the material isn't see through.  Overall, they're a good pair of leggings, just that high waist isn't ideal and a disappointment."
4.0,The edges of the pendant are a bit cloudy. I can scratch it away so it's not too big of a deal. Package came with a nice little bracelet and a note! Would buy again!
4.0,"Nice bracelet but does bend, it is not as sturdy or as thick as the pandora.  On other reviews there are complaints about the clasp this is for safety.  It will become easier or rub it with a little bit of Vaseline.  I do like that the clasp looks like a charm."
4.0,Bought these for my husband's Halloween costume. They're big (almost too big) but they fit his head perfectly. Would but again.
4.0,This dress extremely comfortable and exactly as is in the picture. I do wish the length was a little shorter but for a last minute dress it was amazing!
4.0,Great product for post surgical use in the first couple of weeks in particular. Runs somewhat large and is a little expensive for what it is. Overall a good product though.
4.0,"They are too tight, not really one size fit all. I need them a little looser. Do you have some I can buy that fits looser or size 13?"
4.0,They were good for the price.<br /><br />Nothing special.<br />Sure i would buy it again.
4.0,It makes llookibg for my keys easy enough
4.0,"they fit, they came as expected and they highlight some of the better assets.  all in all very happy buy, and for the cost the quality is pretty spot on."
4.0,"I've ordered the exact same thing previously. The label is different this time. Same soft material. Length is good in body and arms. This time it's just a bit too snug. The old one still fits, just wanted black. Weird."
4.0,The sleeves are a bit short
4.0,"It's cute, hope it holds up for a while!"
4.0,It's comfy and kinda cute. I got the grey and white but the grey is kind of hunter greenish - i was going to return but it would cost to ship it back so I kept it. I wear it with sweats or leggings and lounge in it
4.0,smaller than i wanted but very well done
4.0,"Very cute tracksuit and I'm tall, so I absolutely love the length; However, the zipper is cheap and silver, not the zipper in the photo. The zipper on the picture advertised is the same color as the tracksuit. When I zipped the zipper (before even putting it on) the zipper split and was very difficult to even move. Returning it for a replacement and hoping to receive the correct item."
4.0,"Very good product and worth the money, an exceptional bargain"
4.0,Wish they had an xl or xxl.  Very cute and seemed well made. Sad that I had to return it
4.0,"For the price it works, kinda cheaply made but itll work nice for my loki costume"
4.0,the material is soft and they held their shape after laundering i would buy again
4.0,Ordered a large and they are a little snug but I think that’s how they are supposed to fit.  Short cut on the thigh
4.0,fit smaller than expected. Other than that product was as expected.
4.0,"Nice tie, not great but nice."
4.0,Nice quality earrings that are judt the right size for everyday use. Clasp is secure and i wear these to work daily.
4.0,"Very cute and comfy, but sizing runs small. Definitely size up. I usually wear between a small and a medium, and I should have gotten a large."
4.0,These pants are comforatable and are not see through (a big plus!). I do wish the rise was a little lower. I'm tall (5'11) and they come up to my belly button. But they are solid quality. Comfoatable for wearing around the house and Going to hot yoga.
4.0,I love the design of this top. but somehow I feel a little bit of itchy on it. I would buy it again if they have more soft design.
4.0,It's a bit larger than I expected nonetheless I fell in love with it. It's beautifully made and sturdy!!
4.0,"Very cute, toddler loves it:)"
4.0,"I have ordered this item 3 times, and received an item similar to what I was looking for. I take away a star not for quality of product, but for the Russian roulette style of ordering. If there was some way to find a piece that matches your vision I'd recommend this to all. The piece is well fixed to a weight enabling it to stand very well. It is also packaged decently enough that I didn't have broken branches in my orders."
4.0,"The shirt I received was the wrong color then ordered but still cute. I ordered my normal size, it was more fitted than loose as described so I'd order a size up."
4.0,It's a lightweight cotton which comes just a bit smaller than what I am used to wearing. Ink has an aged appearance.  Your Delta Tau Chi name is:
4.0,Has adjustable size band.
4.0,"This wallet has a place for everything, including coupons. The leather is soft, and it looks very nice. Not too big, not too small. I got it in red, and the color is a muted red perfect for the fall and winter months. Overall, very pleased with my purchase."
4.0,Everything was fine about this blouse! Beautiful!
4.0,Its very cute but runs small.
4.0,"Good quality, but too big.."
4.0,Fits Great = Just Like The Model.
4.0,Looks great but clasp is easily disengaged whenever hand is bent inwards
4.0,"Very cute, but beware of stray wires that poke out. I bought the turquoise and the white. I'd still recommend them though because it's easy to fix with a pair of pliers."
4.0,"These are great sunglasses!  Love the frames and very happy with the quality.  The shape and size are just too big for my face, but for most people would be great.  I love the sun protection and color of lenses.  The case they come in is huge, too big to keep in your purse.<br /><br />I received these at a discount for a review, but this is 100% my opinion."
4.0,"Was not sure what size to order, so I am returning it for a different size.  It looks like it will be a good top layer while running."
4.0,Durable and warm and comfy but they pill because of the elastaine (or whatever is strechy) in them. Older woolen socks did not pill if they only had elastic top bands but were all wool otherwise.
4.0,"Very cute tutu, fits my 2 1/2 year old just right."
4.0,I really like this bag! Definitely smaller than I was anticipating but it's still a decent size.
4.0,cute but a little small
4.0,The bottom (skirt) of the t-shirt is a bit looser than I like but It fits my skinny 10-year-old very well. It seems to be very well constructed. I put it through a washer/dryer cycle and it came out in good shape and with vibrant colors.<br /><br />Although they are made of cotton the fabric has a linen-like feel to it which is a bit stiff which my son found to be uncomfortable.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that you would find my review helpful.
4.0,"This is a very nice watch band. It's made out of heavy, solid metal in a very nice brushed black finish. The links all fit together exactly as they should, and movement between the links is smooth.<br /><br />Seriously, I can't say enough about the high quality finish on this band. I got the black version, and it feels like it should cost many times as much as it does. It's a really, really nice brushed finish that has some grip to it and isn't slippery,. I don't know how well it'll hold up to scratches over time, but initial impressions are extremely good.<br /><br />It's not shiny, either, and matches the finish on my LG G Watch R almost perfectly. It looks like the watch and band were made to go together. I really like it.<br /><br />The band is heavy, solid metal. If you're coming from a leather or rubber watch band, you will absolutely feel the extra weight of this metal band. It's not uncomfortable, but you'll feel it. It looks killer and is as heavy and solid as you'd expect a metal band to be.<br /><br />As you move your wrist around, the band does make a little bit of clinking noise, but it's not bad at all. It's actually a pleasant metal clinking sound and isn't loud enough to even notice unless you're in a very quiet environment. I've certainly heard much louder bands that clink loudly when moved. This is a very subdued sound.<br /><br />The quick-release mechanism on the bottom is nicely designed to blend seamlessly with the clasp, so nothing protrudes wider than the clasp itself. The latch holds very firmly and I'm not worried about it coming off at all.<br /><br />Personally, this band is too big for my wrist, so I'll have to adjust it. This is easily accomplished with a cheap tool, or by taking it to any watch repair place.<br /><br />One note about smartwatches. If you use this band on a smartwatch that requires regular battery charging, this band might affect how that works. With watches that have a docking station like my G Watch R, you'll probably have to turn your watch upside down and place the charger upside down on top of it for this to work. Since the band doesn't open all the way, it's not going to be easy to rest it on the charger. This isn't a big deal, but worth mentioning.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this band. It's kind of crazy that it's so cheap for something that feels so high quality. This is among the cheaper bands available on Amazon, and I totally recommend it.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Looks fantastic<br />- Great brushed metal finish<br />- Easy to attach to any 22mm watch<br />- Matches black watches perfectly<br /><br />CONS:<br />- May affect charging placement of smartwatches"
4.0,Very comfortable and elegant!
4.0,"Very soft, color is bright and didn’t fade after first wash. Bigger then I expected. Size small."
4.0,The fit was a little cheap feeling. The tie kept falling off I guess it wasn’t glued on? Besides that it got the job done for his First Birthday. He’ll probably wear the pants again.
4.0,"Little confusing to adjust the straps, felt like I was outsmarted by a bracelet. But it looks nice, I like it."
4.0,It’s cute but it’s a little wider than I thought it would be.
4.0,Cool sunglasses. Look just like my real oakley's. The tint is dark and with a tight fit around the frame. I had them for about a month and dropped them by accident and scuffed the lens. I don't think they have a scratch guard.
4.0,it worked.
4.0,Loved these tops. They look great over a sports bra or regular bra. Very comfortable.
4.0,"Beautiful piece that worked perfectly for my Viking costume!! I’m a DD, 170lbs, and the XXXXL fit perfectly and was very flattering! The bodice is very adjustable and even comfortable, did not dig in or make me feel like I couldn’t breathe. The only flaw is the halter neck strap, which is not adjustable and an inch or so too short. It does weigh on your neck heavily if you don’t wear the bodice high, but I wore and danced in it for 6-7 hours and it wasn’t enough to make a mark or have a lasting effect. I love the complex looking design and straps to hold weapons, but very easy to put on and adjust. I got a ton of compliments!"
4.0,"Not as cute as I thought it would be, but still a good purchase. It fits right and it does look like the picture."
4.0,Cute. I'm happy with them. 😀
4.0,"I am 5’5” 160lbs and usually wear M. I ordered this shirt in M and it’s too big, way too big. It’s loose around my body which is OK but the arm openings are big and look like I am wearing somebody’s else’s shirt. It shows my bra under my armpit. Now that we determined it’s big I think the look is cute. Front is shorter while back is longer and the shape is like a bell. It’s wider on the bottom. I think if I had ordered this in Small I would enjoy it. Definitely good model for me, I am mommy with a pouch I would like to cover up. Unfortunately, this one is just too large."
4.0,I like that you get a decent amount of tritium tubes for the price especially when you can pay a whole lot more for a tritium tube watches and get no tritium tube on the second hand..Some advertises as a military watch and have NO tritium tube on the second hand which if you are conducting night time opps you need to time things to the second..What I do not like is my Mastop's calender date goes from day 1 to 9 then goes to 0 to day 20..I don't know how the Chinese calender works but the date widow is so small I don't use it anyways..Next is that the online description says its water proof to 30m my watch says 200meters but with no screw down crown I doubt its ability to stay dry inside..My sons tritium tube watch of the same brand was suppose to be waterproof to I think 100 meters and he put his hand under water 8 inches for about a second and a half  trying to grab something he dropped and water got inside..Lastly the description says analog movt the watch says Swiss movt but so far its keeping good time and like I said you get a good amount of tritium tubes for your buck and I hope Amazon has corrected the product description because it completely contradicts what the picture shows. I was happy mine arrived as a bracelet watch not a strap..
4.0,"Very stylish, in a techie sort of way. The band is pretty nice. It's not my primary watch (I have a dressier one), but it's good enough to be your primary watch."
4.0,Love these head wraps perfect for newborns easy to put on no fuss. I love all the colors and the polka dots add that little extra something. Takes a regular onsie from a 1 to 10
4.0,"I washed these in the washer in cold water and dried them in the dryer and they came out fine. Someone commented that theirs had shrunk after washing and I didn't notice any shrinkage.<br /><br />I am 5'4"", weigh 147 with an apple shape, and wear a large or 14/16. I got these leggings in a large and they fit good except that I have weirdly small calves and ankles, and they are loose in those areas. But that's my fault, not the pants🤣<br /><br />I have pretty thick thighs and I don't believe the gray is the most flattering color for me. I can see a bit of cellulite when I have them on, but I planned to wear these leggings purely during workouts (which I do in my living room) so not an issue. They are pretty comfortable to workout in.<br /><br />I would wear these to run errands or for casual as long as I had a nice long tunic top or long sweater on with them."
4.0,Corre pequeño.
4.0,"Its pretty damn good for the price. So far no rip or tear, holds alot. But it makes this terrible squeaky noise if you use the shoulder strap."
4.0,Good basic tunic. Like the ruching on the sides. It is thin material but is not see-through (I have it in black). I just wish it was a little more fitted though. It runs a little big. I would like it much more if it fit my hips better.
4.0,"I love my cheap work gloves, which aren't so cheap anymore. These are triple stitched, great for a glove, but run small sup order up sized"
4.0,Me gustó el artículo...Felicitaciones
4.0,I I usually wear a medium so after reading the reviews I ordered an XXL. It fits perfect! Looks as great in person as in the photo.
4.0,This shoe is a hit! It’s easy for teaching a toddler to take off her shoes and put them on. The black is a good basic that goes well with most outfits. The only issue I have is that after a little while they smell. My toddler is not in them all day long but after 3 hours or do of errands or appointments they get stinky and my daughter wears socks with them.<br /><br />Overall I would buy these again and will buy them in different sizes as her foot grows.
4.0,"The wife Simple loved this shirt, Fit very good and Very comfortable, Great T if you love the SHOW!"
4.0,"Cute inexpensive dress! The material is thick enough that it hides all undergarment lines. It is form fitting but still flattering. I am 5'2&#34; and 130 lbs and the medium fit great. Hit right at my knees. Only issue was a little gapping in the armpit area but not a deal breaker. Overall, nice dress especially for the price!"
4.0,"Right size for everything water bottle, glass case, wallet phone. It all fits with room to spare."
4.0,Sleeves a little long but super comfy
4.0,The frame feels flimsy and weak.  Decent for the price.
4.0,"I bought the light pink pair in a medium. I'm 5'3 and 152 lbs at 17 weeks pregnant. These are comfy and SUPER stretchy! They will fit me well throughout my pregnancy. The only reason why I give it 3 stars is because they are borderline too big (I started my pregnancy at about 139, so I gained weight fast) and they are SEE THROUGH. Guys, I may as well not have been wearing them at all. You could see eeerrrythang. So, I'm exchanging them for a Black 2 pack (P.S. Why do they not have black in a single pair option??). Hopefully, the dark color will be better. I'll update how that goes. So, for sizing, you may want to stick to your pregnancy size otherwise it might be too big. I'll share if the black follows the same sizing."
4.0,"These tabi socks are comfortable, easy to wear. They come out of the laundry looking like brand new. I love them!"
4.0,"If the sizing was correct, I would give it 5 stars.  Bought several sets to give as gifts to men and women in the family, but the even the Large is more like a small-medium. Great for a couple of women, but the guys didn't get them because of the sizing being so off.  if you wear a women's small, order Medium.  If you wear women's Medium, get a Large. If you wear a women's Large or for medium to large men, don't get it at all."
4.0,I really liked the dress because it fits well and was true to size. I also really liked the colour I got which was olive green. It turned out perfect.
4.0,I got this free for ordering a purse. But the color is not the same and doesn’t go together at all. My iPhone 13 Pro does fit inside.
4.0,"Very beautiful vest, im usually a Medium but this was a little to tight. Go a size bigger."
4.0,"I LOVE the boot, BUT it’s just too short in the toe. It would have fit better with 10 1/2. I would suggest if at all possible to make a size 11. And yes there is a smell to them."
4.0,Quality flannel. Im 6'4 210lb and the waist and arm length are perfect. They are not kidding about the slim fit. The shirt is too tight to put over a hoodie but fits well over a t and long sleeve.
4.0,"I love the way this purse looks and how much it holds. It is a stiffer purse, so it retains it's shape really well, which is the exact opposite of what I had before it (saggy, baggy, and hated it). My only complaint is that I wish the handles were stiffer. I'd like them to kind of actually stay the way it looks in the picture--upright."
4.0,I wanted something different for myself and this was just it.  I remembered that these were made without clasps or prongs to open and close so it was very easy to slip on and remove.  My arthritist fingers don't have to worry about taking this on and off.  I really like it.
4.0,"I find work-out style shorts to often be on the short side and more form fitting then I want. I'm 5'1 and 140 lbs and received the size large, which fit loose but not baggy.  The shorts are well made and I liked the length.  They were above mid-thigh, but well below the butt.  Even if doing actual yoga bends, you're not exposing yourself in the rear while wearing these.  The material is thick but light and comfortable and you can move very freely.  They could easily go over a legging if you wanted to wear them in cold weather (although I'm not sure why you would).  I will definitely wear these once the weather warms up for hanging out around the house or for working out.<br /><br />I will say, it, if you're looking for something super stylish - this is not it.  They are practical, well made and modest.  If you're looking for something to make the most of any figure, then keep looking."
4.0,I bought this for my daughter for cheerleading. All her stuff fits perfectly and the water bottle holders are fantastic.
4.0,It’s a decent cleaning product. It didn’t get all my scuffs out but it’s a decent product.
4.0,"The packing cubes have a zipper that goes all the way around to compress the cube once you've filled it.  They are well made though there are 2 points. 1 is that the inside seams are covered with a non woven fabric rather than a nicer ribbon.  The 2nd thing, and the reason I dinged it a star, is that the zipper that you use to get access to the  packing space only goes around the top.  I prefer to have the cube open all the way around so that I can fold and place the clothes in more easily."
4.0,"This slinky satin slip dress is not the highest quality construction, but nonetheless quite interesting and fun to wear. I got this dress in the rust color medium size (I am 5'7"", 150 lb, size 8), and it fit very well all over. But before wearing it I had to wash it because it arrived stained!!! Luckily Oxi-Clean was able to remove the stains and I could wear the dress. It is very roomy in the bust in case you have a large chest. The spaghetti straps are adjustable, as is the ruching on the side that controls the length of the dress. The satin material is very very lightweight to the point that it hugs every little curve (even my belly button!). It is also completely unlined. I would perhaps wear this dress with shapewear underneath to smooth everything out. On the plus side, the material is very silky and soft, and - thank goodness - is not prone to wrinkling. Overall this isn't a very high quality dress, but I did enjoy wearing it and think it would be fun for a night out."
4.0,Have other Champion shorts.  These ran a little small.
4.0,"The dress in Cowgirl print is super cute and fits well. Once again the measurements on this Grace Karin dress are just what the chart says they are. The fabric is a nice medium weight cotton blend with a slight stretch. The top back has a bit of elastic for better fit. The straps are one size with a button, you will have to move the button yourself if you want to change the fit as there is only one each on the straps. I plan on sewing them to the dress myself. The only thing I wish the dress had was the pockets that Grace Karin adds to the skirts."
4.0,"Very pretty on, but the fabric is a littler thinner than the same item in brown."
4.0,I love the colors and they fit the phone. I got them for gifts to family and friends. Also I can change them to match my outfits
4.0,This is a very nice strap and I almost kept it.  The reason for return was the reddish color on the edges.  It is very nice though
4.0,If you like thicker straps...you might like this one. I purchased one for my Casio Protrek PRW-60. I wanted a canvas strap like the Barton one I had on my Ball Fireman Nightbreaker (love that strap). Unfortunately I needed 24mm and Barton doesn't make one that big. I found the canvas to be soft as opposed to the denier feel of the Barton ones. The canvas feels more cottony than nylon to be honest. The buckle is fantastic! its chunky and made of brushed metal with a slight chrome accent.
4.0,I wear medium everything but this is a little snug on the belly...not terrible but a large would work better so it's not so form fitting. I'm 5'6&#34; 148lbs. Is a little short but material is stretchy and soft. Quality feels good but haven't worn yet just tried on.
4.0,These boxes were as described and made the perfect box for necklaces I had purchased that did not include a box.
4.0,"*PLEASE READ*<br />So I’m giving four stars because I can wear it and it’s awesome fabric however there are cons to the dress.<br /><br />1. It was too small. Smaller than I had expected and too small to wear out on its own without something underneath. They ARE Asian sizes that are clearly for the typical Asian body (short and very thin)<br />2. Too short. Like I previously said, can’t wear without something underneath. Seldom is something too short for me because I’m already short and my legs are shorter than my torso lol.<br />3. Took a while to get here but that was expected. Just something I didn’t like. Not too long but I’m spoiled with this prime 2 day shipping.<br /><br />But, if you plan on losing weight or don’t mind if things are a little snug I’d say go ahead and get it. I did. No harm in trying it out.<br />Also, it looks like it fits a seven year old. Just put it on. Because it’s not TOOOOO small on me, just pretty snug."
4.0,Nice embroidery.  Baggy around butt. Comfortable
4.0,"This is a cute set. Runs a little large but for the price I got it for, I'll keep it."
4.0,it is cute and soft although the shorts are too big.  your child's size should be smaller than normal
4.0,"This rain jacket fits nicely. I ordered a size medium.<br /><br />When the jacket is unzipped it looks perfect. However when I zip it up I kinda have to fold the bottom under as I can’t zip it otherwise. This may be due to the fact that I have a lot of booty and thighs.<br /><br />I don’t feel I necessarily should have ordered a large as I feel that a large would have been too big. It’s just that my top proportion is smaller than the bottom.<br />Although I have not worn it in the rain, it does seem as if it would keep me dry. I liked the striped inner lining of the hood. The inside lining of the jacket is the same as outside.<br /><br />Overall I am really happy with this rain jacket. I would recommend to others. 👍🏾"
4.0,I bought two in two sizes. One too small. This one has extra long sleeves.
4.0,these are great. I use them to speed up leg recovery after I run. does the job. loses a star for not being warm at all. especially the toe area. there is nothing there. I have to put another pair of socks over them to keep my toes warm in the winter.
4.0,"Pretty , fun to play with different styles"
4.0,Nice color of green but fabric is a bit thin and clingy. I’ll keep it and wear with leggings.
4.0,I liked fit me big
4.0,"Love the shoe. Size is a little off though. Ordered these for school shoes, but are bigger then expected. Should fit him by Christmas time."
4.0,"Order two of the bracelets, they are cute but they the colors are different from what's shown on the picture. But all in all they are cute for the price."
4.0,"These are not the normal type of earring that I'm used to seeing, so I figured I'd get a set for my wife to try out. She likes them. They're light, and are noticeable. She's not sure about the 'C' going on the ear, as it might be bothersome over some time, but she can deal with it. I think they're cool looking, and sexy. You don't see a set of these very often, so they catch the eye."
4.0,"These were super comfy and didn't shed like some of the other slippers I've tried.  Unfortunately, they only lasted about a month before one came apart.  I do wear them a lot since I'm working from home but I don't do anything crazy with them to create wear & tear.  For the price, I guess I'd buy it again."
4.0,Ordered for my granddaughter and she liked both necklaces.
4.0,Dress was beautiful! Fit was good except for the back. I would have kept it but something was wrong with zipper. It bubbled in the back. Like there was a hump.  Did not lay flat. Disappointed.
4.0,"extremely pretty , a bit larger than I like, and heavier than I anticipated. But, I do like it"
4.0,"I like the set, definitely size up for this one! I usually wear a EU size 38 in my clothing, got a Large for this set but it’s pretty tight at the arm area! the pants are super cute though"
4.0,"Nice shirt, just like picture but does run big."
4.0,"I like this item. However, my glasses fog up too often while wearing it. Not sure if it's the material. Also, I wish the inside was black because my makeup rubs all on the white & it shows really bad inside."
4.0,Looks good and very soft!<br />makes a great gift.
4.0,"The color and pattern of the dress is beautiful! To wear it, there's a hole to feed one of the ties (the longer one) through the dress so that you can cinch the dress around your waist.<br /><br />My issue is that the wrap part of the dress means that you'll need to manually pin down the slip every time you wear this, unless you're ready to show off your panties whenever you're walking forward or you are standing in windy weather. This dress might work a lot better as a swimsuit cover-up for this reason."
4.0,"Granted I have larger than average &#34;assets&#34; but as long as you remove the small padding in the bra, way to small for the large I bought, it fits fine."
4.0,Very cute clothes I’m not sure how I like it on me but it is extremely cute brings me back to the 80s when I used to wear stuff like this all the time
4.0,I like this was just my size and could be use for a child!
4.0,"Much larger than I thought it would be.  Ordered the xl because I thought the large-14 would be too small.  Boy was I wrong, the dress fit like a smock on me, so returning and ordering the large. Nice dress, was worried it would be thin but not at all.<br />It has a little stretch to it too."
4.0,"I usually order a medium, but ordered a large after reading the reviews that the dress runs small.  I can fit into the large, but it's a little too snug to be flattering, so I've had to order an extra-large!  But it's a pretty dress, and well worth the price."
4.0,Looks good. I have not wore it yet
4.0,"Great glasses for the price, I wish the plastic was slightly more flexible, so far they seem to be fairly scratch resistant. These offer good slightly polarized protection from the sun. Love the color!"
4.0,"The fabric of these pants is soft and comfy, and they are relaxed in the legs, which is what I wanted. As I am a size 18 in jeans, I figured I would order an XXL. It says size 20 on the label, which is about right when you let out the drawstring waist. They are not particularly petite in length. They are not as long as most pants, which is a plus, but they are still too long for me, and I'm 5'4&#34;."
4.0,"I bought this necklace about 2-3 years ago and I pretty much wore it every single day, never taking it off.  It just now broke and I am back to get another one :)"
4.0,This shirt fit as expected. Not too long but not at the belly button. A little see through at the top of the shirt but very comfortable.
4.0,"Beautiful pattern. Lots of complimients! I wish these came in flats, not very comfortable if you will be standing for a long time...i.e concerts, and such....but love the look"
4.0,"I really like this top, and it is almost perfect.  Unfortunately,  it has a weird stretch to it. Because of this, it is a little thicker and could possibly run a little small. I wanted this to be more flowing and light. I still like it though. For reference,  I am 5'4"" and 140 pounds."
4.0,"This is such a cute dress! I love the puff sleeves and that the tie is completely removable and adjustable so you can tie it off on the front or the side or wherever you like. The denim is a thick but not bulky and it really nips in the waist with the tie. One thing to note is when you are sitting in this dress it does bunch up, but standing it looks really cute."
4.0,Very comfy pant but a little short for my son.
4.0,I like the fact that it stretches well according to my wrist size.<br />Pros<br />This bracelet is bright and is pleasant for the eyes.<br />The elastic band is strong enough to hold all the boho cowrie shell pieces together without breaking or falling apart.<br />The blue and white color goes well with aqua beach theme wear.<br />It is great to wear for beaches parties and other occasions
4.0,"I bought what I expected was a dark mustard yellow but I got chocolate brown which I obviously can't argue is technically ""khaki"", not the reason I gave it 4 out of 5. I left out a star because its not as thick and warm as I expected but for the price, it'll do. Might get more colors!"
4.0,"I like it however, you definitely have to wear a shirt under it"
4.0,"I bought these gloves because my sister had gotten some from Costco that she loves. I tried to get some there, but Costco decided to put out swimming suits in January, so I turned to Amazon. I got a size medium. I wish I could have compared a medium and a large because they are a little snug, but I think they are good enough. I'm excited to finally have a good warm pair of gloves. I love the little pocket and the fact that you can cinch the gloves down at the top!"
4.0,"Pretty good, comes with cleaning cloth and case is a plus.  Looks a little cheaper in person. I think its the random designs on the ear pieces."
4.0,"I like this pretty shirt, but it is not quite as flattering on me as the shorter style tees from this same company."
4.0,"I bought these for my 2 year olds birthday. Dits fine on him, but way too small for any adult."
4.0,"This UA hoodie is pretty good ...<br />It has three things I like; it's  a hoodie, it's a 1/4 zip and it's made of a mid-weight polyester fleece  (somewhat thicker than your typical poly 1/4 zip).<br />It provides adequate warmth on cool days and overall, this is a well-made hoodie.<br />With that said, this would easily be a 5-star hoodie in my book. However, the loose fit is a bit too loose.<br />I am 5'10&#34; 175lbs and got the large (the recommended size for my build per UA's site). The arm length is just right with a little bit of slack. The body and length are what makes this cut seem somewhat large. For someone with a larger/ taller frame than I, the large would probably be perfect. A medium might be a better cut for some with a slightly smaller frame than I.<br />Otherwise, this is a good looking hoodie.<br />Would highly recommend for those who prefer this style of hoodie. And, if you get the size/ cut that suits your frame, you'll be a happy camper."
4.0,my daughter loved these!  they are nice colors and made well. perfect for dressing up a dress with a skinny belt. Only complaint is the gold buckles.  It would be nice to have the same colors with the option to have silver buckles.
4.0,Good quality of shirts
4.0,I live that it has stretch and isn’t a stuff skirt . All the pockets work as well :) just wish it was more fitted at the bottom
4.0,Like the colors. A little small but stretching. I wear a 10.5 and ordered an 11. Warm and easy to walk around in
4.0,"Edited September 2019: I contacted the seller and told them the problem. They sent a new one, free of charge! It's been working just fine for the past 2 months. Thanks for great customer service!<br /><br />Used at camp by my teenager. Worked great for just over 1 month, and then the display stopped working. It fit his wrist nicely and seemed comfortable. Wish it had worked longer!"
4.0,I'm short with small calves so fit well.  Wished they offered more mmGH options though.  I would like it to be tighter.
4.0,"The colors (teal and magenta) are exactly as depicted, and this is a very showy necklace set.  The metal is not a true black but more of a gun metal finish.  It has a rich, opulent effect, and it will absolutely get you noticed.  The stones are just glued onto the chain, so be very careful how you handle it.  I would also avoid extreme temps because that could break down the glue.  I took some black silk embroidery thread and &#34;stitched&#34; each piece onto the chain, tying it off in back.  It's pretty invisible, and at least if the glue fails, the thread should hold it into place until it can be reglued.  Each jeweled section is stitched independent of the others.  The earrings are post and clutch, and not very heavy.  They come with a disc-style clutch, so they sit properly in your ear.  The necklace has a lobster claw clasp, so it is easy to adjust.  The four star rating is because of the glue, otherwise it would have been five stars.  A fun, dramatic piece at a great price point."
4.0,"I really like this band. It is soft, and the colors are great. However, for me, it is too big. My watch slides around on my wrist, which is obviously not ideal for getting accurate readings. It's too bad because I love this so much otherwise."
4.0,"Good Day Class! Today we are discussing Nose Jewelry...It's Fake! #TheyreNotGonnaKnow #TakeNotes<br />1. The nose septum cuff rings come in four colors (Rose gold, silver, black or Yellow Gold) Insert right over the septum, gently push in as comfortably as possible...done.<br />2. The fake piercings cuff to the rim of the nostril. Again, insert cuff over the rim, push in as comfortably as you would like and position the ""nose ring"" where you would like...done.<br /><br />What do we like? There are many choices of septum and nose rings with silver or gold wire, and simple to extravagant designs, although some designs seemed repetitive. There are some other stones for decoration...pearls and crystals....lots of designs to choose from. The septum rings were pretty and looked real... even from the side (My fave), and the four colors gave a little variety to the otherwise repetitive design.<br />Room for improvement....I think there should be a way to shorten the upper wire because my small nose doesn't need so much wire leading to the design. Also, many real nose rings are just one diamond stud. Some of the fake nose ring designs could use some rhinestones. A minimalistic design could be just one or a trio of rhinestones.<br />My recommendation is to TRY IT!!! I am a newbie to nose rings and these are cute. It's a great kit with 25+ pieces to use on girls night out, or for a bridal shower. They are so easy to use, and fun! So, #Who'sAddingToTheCart #LetsHeadToCheckout #ClassIsDismissed!"
4.0,"My fault for not being able to wear it till 2months later...<br />I'm in between small and medium so I ordered the medium, unfortunately it onLy just ALMOST fits.<br />The length is fine but the arms are tight. Fabric seems a little thin. Can't wear it but can't return it either. Got spoiled by Macy's where I can return it whenever, w/ receipt."
4.0,When I got it was impressed it's pretty and heavy but not sure if how long will it last especially the color my Dad didn't wear it yet.
4.0,Great feel and flow. Comfy. Made big you can order a size smaller than normal if you like.
4.0,I love the color.. It was a present for one of my girls... She loves it too but time will tell how well it performs..😏
4.0,"Necklace is beautiful and made of shiny gold. The downsides is that the chain is very thin and small and doesn’t seem substantial. That said, beautiful, simple design. Just wish it were a sturdier thicker chain."
4.0,nice go to outfit for going out. I purchased this for my son's kindergarten graduation.
4.0,There cool slippers
4.0,These are very comfortable maybe a little tight around the crotch but that's because I should of ordered a size larger. I love the fabric these are made from it is very soft.
4.0,Slightly thin but good for fall chilly days with a light layer underneath. I have a long torso and this comes to the top of my jeans. I prefer something a bit longer but that is difficult to find no matter the company.<br /><br />I’m 5’7 athletic build. 155lbs. I ordered a medium and it’s a good fit. Not too snug and not baggy. If you’re looking for a relaxed fit maybe go a size up.
4.0,These bracelets are very nice I love the way that they connect with a magnet
4.0,Very Warm jacket and not heavy at all I were this in 30 ° weather and was plenty warm
4.0,It's not as fitted as I was hoping. It's kinda loose on me through the waist.
4.0,Nice overall.. would buy again
4.0,"The dress feels good on, am 5'7&#34; with ample hips. I ordered a medium but wish I'd home with a small. The skirt on the dress has a lot of fabric and it was big in the waist and chest areas for me"
4.0,Super cute dress! My daughter loves it!
4.0,These fit as expected. They are slightly see through outdoors. Don't recommend for working out. After 8 months of washing and wearing they have holes along the seams
4.0,"These glasses work well for me. I've purchased several pair (too many) from Eyekepper but at this price point it's hard not to be a slave to fashion. They are exactly as described. My only complaint is that they cannot be returned. I ordered the wrong pair, absolutely my fault, but now I have 2 pair of the exact same glasses! I would gladly exchange them for the pair I wanted but I am stuck. VisionKr has all the EXACT same styles that Eyekepper has. I have several pair from them too. I will check out their return policy."
4.0,This outfit looked adorable on my daughter for her birthday!! Bought a 2T which is normally a little big on her and the skirt was very tight on her stomach and luckily the shirt was stretchy or it wouldn’t have fit. Looked more like a 12 month. But it was adorable and quality was great.
4.0,"I want to give it a perfect review I really do, but the advertising is misleading. It’s not a crisp white like it claims or picture shows it’s a greyish off white and the logo is just different and not as vibrant. But it’s so soft and fits so good. I love wearing it on and off stream. I hung dry it to avoid shrinking. Now mind the review i still love the hoodie regardless of the color flaws, just allow me as the consumer to choose if I want the color difference or not"
4.0,"High quality polarized sunglasses.  The glasses are well packaged , comes with lens cloth and fitted case.  The frame and glasses feels ""heavy"" and well constructed.  It is a little bigger than I expected.  I have a rounded face and usually fit most regular sized adult sunglasses.  For me, it was still a little loose and the lenses are on the larger side.  It could probably use some adjustment to fit better to my face.  I tried it out while driving and it is very comfortable on my eyes and shaded me from the afternoon sun glare without reducing visibility.  There are 2 shades going on though.  Top is more rose tinted and bottom half is bluish tinted, which give better visibility to look at LCD screens in the car.  My kids thought it's too cool for me, but I feel like an extra on Top Gun Maverick. :-)"
4.0,My daughter loved them they are really cute!
4.0,Same material as LuLaRoe!  Beautiful pattern!  I only took off a star because I don't really like the elastic in the waist band.  Otherwise a great alternative!
4.0,They are nice  and at a good price. They actually work. Hope they wont tarnish
4.0,Bra size very small
4.0,"Its a very cute necklace, even a little larger than I expected. The chain is a good quality. The large stone (which is painted plastic) had fallen out when it arrived. I just glued it back in place. Also the stone has already peeled some of the blue revealing the clear plastic gem underneath. I do realized that I paid less then ten bucks for it, so I got what I paid for. It's still very cute and i wear it often."
4.0,I haven't had a chance to wear the bike shorts yet.  I wish I had bought a smaller size because it was a little big on me.
4.0,my son is very happy with his necklace.
4.0,The sizing is a bit confusing. I ordered a size small and lucky for me it's a size 8 which is what I was hoping for.
4.0,"Fabric is thin, cut runs loose/big"
4.0,"My husband is 6'5"" tall, and so we sometimes have issues finding pants that are long enough for him. Even if he is okay with things coming up a little bit higher on his ankles and he would prefer, very frequently pants don't work out on him because of the length. However, in the past we found that brands such as Joe's jeans have a little bit of extra room at the bottom of the leg so that the pants can have a fashionable rumple at the base.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these jeans were just too short for my husband's legs. They came up to the low or midcalf on him, and while they were comfortable, stretchy, cute and super stylish, there was really no way of adjusting the hem or the styling to make them work for his 34 inch inseam.<br /><br />The most similar pair of jeans he owns is by Joe's jeans, which is also supposed to be a super stretchy, and super soft denim. These jeans from genuine assembly are more stiff, less soft, and overall seem more like a regular pair of jeans, but just have that little bit of added stretch and softness like most women's jeans have nowadays. I think that the claims of being good for working out are probably overblown, unless your workouts do not include a lot of big movements or sweat. However, for lounging around the house, these seemed exceptionally comfortable around the waist and in the fit. I also appreciated that they didn't seem like they wanted to fall down on my husband's backside, like so many modern jeans seem styled to do.<br /><br />Overall these are of very good quality and are truly nice pair of slightly stretchy, slightly soft jeans, as long as your inseam is fairly short, I would say these would be best for 30 to 31 inch inseam length."
4.0,Ran into a couple of problems but they contacted me and resolved the issues. Just one tip don’t wash! 💙
4.0,Nice but runs a tad big
4.0,Solid. Work well for golf. No visible distortion of depth perception issues which was my concern. Only knock is that they don't quite wrap around far enough to truly fit over your hat above your ears. You can still wear them that way ( I do) but what can you expect for less than $10. Solid product.
4.0,"I am a skier, monoskier, and snowboarder.  I needed some padded shorts with a drawstring and this was the only one I found that had that feature.  I hate that padded shorts can slide down so easily, so the drawstring is a top feature.  I received these today in the mail and tried them on.<br /><br />They fit a bit smaller than their guide says, but I knew that already from reading the reviews, so did buy one size larger.  It's a good fit, so thanks to those who pointed this issue out.<br /><br />Next, the tailbone padding is going to be hit or miss whether it actually protects your tailbone at all.  It's going to totally depend on fit.  If you're buying these specifically for snowboarding and tailbone protection, be aware that this design has a 50/50 shot at fitting you just right to offer the tailbone protection.  For skiers and monoskiers looking specifically for hip protection, I think these will do the trick nicely.  I have owned 3 different pairs of padded shorts in the past, and these seem to be a better design to me.<br /><br />Be aware that these are made from a thinner neoprene-type material so they may be HOT on warm ski days.  They also feel a tiny bit restrictive in movement, but for skiing, it's not exactly like you're breakdancing, so I think the shorts will work out just fine, and the neoprene will only add to the extra protection of the integrate foam pads in the hips and tail.<br /><br />I think these are a good value and should work out nicely...too bad they are not available in XL and XXL...or maybe they are just out of stock right now...but I really could use an XL to give as a gift to a family member."
4.0,"These are great.  Comfortable, versatile design from casual to noir-so- casual. Feminine but not frilly.<br />I have three.  I may get more.  Great value, great look."
4.0,"I like the color of the actual product better than the shade that appeared on the picture. Not a lot of difference, but just a tad."
4.0,"This item is beautifully crafted, but delicate, very very delicate. Detail is amazing, but it broke just trying it on! Very disappointed cause beads went every-damn-where... LOL. I have children so was more concerned for choking hazard and stepping on them as well on Hardwood floors, not carpet. But would buy it again and just be super super careful."
4.0,"Great earrings, but can't really see the purple"
4.0,Bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. Only complaint is that it was a little bit bigger than what a normal small should be.
4.0,"It is somewhat large but looks great with a wide green belt worn as a shirtdress and when worn as a duster it can be shortened a bit for my proportions (5'1&#34;). the coloation and the striping &#34;freaked&#34;me a bit when I saw it in my hand because of the culture I come from, Austria and the horrors of the Holocaust, the camp wear. The strong green or any other color takes ot away from that nightmarish flashback. I would love to have pockets sewn into the side seams or green/blue/red/mustard pockets sewn on top of the stripe pattern."
4.0,"Love the material. I ordered a 16 (originally a 14) because the last pair (different design, same brand) was a bit too snug. So I decided to go with the 16. Bad idea, now these are loose. These pants have and elastic waist band, so the 14 would have been perfect for me."
4.0,"It’s a cute dress, I bought it for a “Western” holiday party. I got this in a size large, I didn’t want it to be too tight, It was pretty loose in the mid section, so I added a belt to define my waist a bit. I’m 5’2 and my measurements are 35-29-42"
4.0,Looks great! Fits great! Vary dark but ya can still see just fine.
4.0,This is a cute shirt.
4.0,Comes a little big and gold scratches off a little.
4.0,"Nice fabric and closure device however, it needs a logo/label to give it a more “finished” look."
4.0,Item was received as expected in good timing. The Key ring is fairly heavy duty and the material used for the pick is light.
4.0,"I should have gotten a small but I got a medium. They're not like your average yoga pants that are tight and really hug your body they're VERY stretchy and loose. For that reason I should return them but its not worth it, if they're too big on you, you will need to keep pulling them up while exercising but if it's the right size I'm sure they would stay snug."
4.0,"They are great for reading, love the slim style and flexibility of the frame.  I like that they come in more powerful lens strengths than most over the counter reading glasses."
4.0,Beautiful! Wear it everyday!
4.0,Im 5'2&#34; 110lbs  34DD (athletic build). the dress was not as form fitting as I had hoped and a tad long for my taste. I prefer it to hit at or above the knee but I am short after all.<br />Ill keep it and have it hemmed. I bought it for work (I should have gotten the navy - more business like).
4.0,Bought this for me and my hubby when we purchased our first home. I liked the size of the writing in the key chain and the elegant look. I have only had it for a couple weeks and it’s been great. Got many compliments when I posted photos online. Just hoping the little house doesn’t fall off.
4.0,"These sleeves are great, but a bit tight and the thumb hole is too small."
4.0,"They are very dangly, light and very pretty, loved the shape.<br />but also very fragile.<br />Not good for bouncing around the workplace or the helmet chin strap<br /><br />Easily tangled in long hair"
4.0,Used it for a wedding. It was nice and traveled in the airport well the next day
4.0,Purchased for Cosplay.
4.0,"I love this watch!. I love the pastel pink color it comes in. The silicone, like one of the other reviewers mentioned, has a hint of metal to it. So while the strap feels soft like silicone, it looks clean and sheen. It doesn't look rubbery at all. The display is reasonably large so the digits are legible. I wish it were a little brighter though, because I sometimes have to tilt the watch towards the light to read the time clearly. It does have a light function but I don't like having to use my other hand. I however expected this from the images here, so it's not a disappointment at all. It's great if what you're looking for in a watch is time, date, stopwatch and alarm functions. Overall a wonderful product for the price. I've just received this and I'm very happy so far. I look forward to seeing how the watch holds up.<br /><br />Three months later:<br />The color on the silicone fades off ever so slowly, but the watch is still in good condition. I've ended up really appreciating the light feature. I can't read my other digital watch in the dark."
4.0,"This is a very useful insert for my large bags.  I have 3 that I switch between and this is a great time saver. I just grab it out of one ppurse and stick it in another. No issues ..... except one.  The reason for my 4/5 rating.  The middle insert  is held on by velcro.. and thats great. it works and stays put.  Hoever, the bottom of the  velcro additive is open onthe bottom.  My wallet, which is relatives thick, still manages to fall through the bottom and ends up underneath the middle insert.  So do my lip glosses that I stand up on end to fit in there, and my pens and other items.  So while it is still containing all my items in my purse, it isnt veery organized.  Wish the bottoms were closed off."
4.0,"Not a bad shirt for the price. The only problem is, if you have larger than normal arms/biceps or are buff, this shirt will feel tight around your chest, shoulders, and biceps. I guess if you have a slim physique, it shouldn't bother you. I'm 5'10 ~170lb - the medium was WAY too small, and even the large was a bit too snug, so I ended up returning them. But like I said, if it fits you, it's not a bad deal"
4.0,"These shorts fit good. More like booty shorts or cotton spandex lol. I'm 5&#34;1' and about 125 pounds and I ordered a medium, they fit well. I would recommend."
4.0,IM 228 LBS. AND I BROUGHT A 2X FITS ME TIGHT BUT I LOVE THEM
4.0,"As long as you use the measurements they provide you will get the correct size.  So make sure you measure correctly.  It was well sewn and a good value for the price that you pay.  The blue color is beautiful but didn't look right on my skin tone.  Overall, I liked this very much but it was also slightly too &#34;shiny&#34; for my taste.  It was extremely comfortable and I almost kept it but I am not sure how often I would actually wear it so I returned it.  I may buy it in the black because that would be more versatile."
4.0,I liked that it fit perfectly and my grandson loved it
4.0,Great for dress up. After lots of use the seam is fraying near the elbow opening.
4.0,Size ran small.  Had to return.  Seller was very accommodating.
4.0,These run HUGE. My baby is average size. at 14 months she’s about 20 pounds. In the typical baby brands like target or carters she fits perfectly in 12 month and can wear 18 month with maybe the sleeves rolled. These overalls are HUGE i had to roll them twice and cross the back straps. I’m a bit bummed the wraps aren’t thicker the rest of the pants are great quality. She could have easily been in the 6-12 month size. Return is a pain for me so I’m going to just have her wear them 🤷🏼‍♀️
4.0,"I originally ordered a small, and returned it & bought an extra small. I absolutely love it! The fabric is beautiful, but thin & a little seethrough. I might sew in a liner, or I’ll need to buy a slip."
4.0,These glasses work really well.<br />My only issue with these glasses is that the frames are a little larger than I would like.<br />The glasses are well made and packaged.<br />These would make a nice gift.
4.0,I like it because it is Grimm.  The key doesn't open all the way.  It is kinda flimsy.
4.0,Just needs a tiny bit of adjustment
4.0,Perfect shoe except that the toe area is a bit too tight.
4.0,A good size.
4.0,"This is wonderful, soft, substantial material, as was promised.  I love the colors, and depending on how you fold it, you can have different colors as the main color.  It is a larger size than I would like.  My only complaint is that I would rather not have the blue border."
4.0,"The only thing that I have to say is the fabric it's little strange isn't soft, but in general it's ok"
4.0,"Love the hat and am really excited to wear it for the Kentucky Derby.  However, it could have been mailed in something sturdier where the delivery people would know not to put it in the mail box.  Disappointed and not having much luck getting the creases out from this, but hopefully I will have it out by the Derby."
4.0,Easily wrinkles but looks so pretty! I wore it with jeans shorts. Im usually a size small. It fit loose on me.
4.0,If you are tall these run on the shorter side.
4.0,This is value for money. Not the highest quality but holds up well and makes any outfit more appealing
4.0,"I took me a little bit to get used to it. My arms are big and it was cutting off the circulation. I think they stretched out or my arms got smaller not sure, but it works well for the purpose I purchased them for. I bought 3 packages."
4.0,"I just love this bracelet so much !! I am a huge butterfly lover and this bracelet is just perfect. I like how light weight it is and how dainty it is, Great quality however I do find it kind of annoying that the butterfly doesn't lay flat but I still love this bracelet !! So cute"
4.0,They fit well and match almost everything. Side zip makes it easy to take off.
4.0,"Sadly the large case was damaged upon arrival. The zipper was not sewn in properly and the contents of my luggage would’ve been all over baggage claim, had I not noticed before our trip.<br />Annoying to have to send back & try to find better luggage.<br />Update:<br />Customer service reached out and were on top of it. Willing to replace bags free of charge. So because of that giving 4 stars"
4.0,Loved this dress. I ordered it in a xxl.  Fit was perfect.  The arms/shoulders were a bit tight.. Yet manageable.  I added a white tutu to.have more of a flare.
4.0,The front was a little low but pretty nice of that’s what you want. Very nice thin material perfect for summer and hot weather! Love it!
4.0,Color combination
4.0,I really like the way it looks and feels and how  modest it is.
4.0,"Cute and petite, just what I wanted but it's difficult to bend and put in some piercings"
4.0,"I'm a size 12 and usually take a medium or large in sweaters. I ordered the apricot in size Large. I was not very impressed with it when I tried it on out of the bag. It was too loose, felt a little frumpy, and the strap across the back of the neck felt awkward, but I really liked the color, so I decided to see what a wash and dry would do.<br /><br />It helped greatly. The sweater came out very soft and fits in a more flattering way now. I still have to roll up the sleeves, and the back of the sweater is just a tad longer than I'd like, but I thought it looked nice with leggings and boots. And I still don't love the strap, but it's a solid four stars."
4.0,A bit snug on my fingers and short on length
4.0,The sizes do run small. I ordered my two year old boy who wears 2T a 5T and it just fits him. But over all very nice product.
4.0,"This quickly became my new favorite work shirt. It is perfectly feminine and flowy. The light fabric is great so I don't get too hot. Perfect style for a professional outfit. My only issue is that it is semi-sheer, I have to wear a tank top under it, which slightly defeats the purpose of it being so light for me.<br /><br />Ordered size XL. My measurements are B: 39&#34; W:31 H: 42<br /><br />Pro: great for the price<br />Con: not enough lining"
4.0,"Nice color,  stones stayed intact after process. However,  wax stuff to form onto teeth didn't work well.😐  only the bottom piece stayed in place.  Need a stage gum  paste of some sort to insure it would adhere.  For the price, not bad item! I will buy again from seller!"
4.0,"They are winter motorcycle gloves,  comfortable, still have plenty of feed back from the bike. Wind chill is a thing so if your planning on doing 70 on the freeway when it's 45 degrees. Get some hand warmer pads to toss in the gloves and your boots and you will be fine for a good long ride."
4.0,"I got the red/ grey/ black and it is very comfortable. Does run small... I usually wear a medium, got a large and probably would order an xl"
4.0,"Hermoso, me encanta"
4.0,Recommend half size up
4.0,Not quite as warm as it could be.<br />Like satin because it doesn't get Tangled when I roll over.
4.0,"The jewelry is really nice, but the length of the bar is shorter than I expected. I haven’t tried to put it in yet, ‘cause my piercing is still very fresh and it’s really tender at the moment. 2 comes in the package so, that’s a plus. Can’t wait till my piercing is healed so, I can wear it."
4.0,"My daughter weighs 10 pounds and is 22 inches long. She fits perfectly in 0-3 months clothes. This is definitely too big. Material is nice, its really cute, I'm excited for her to grow into it but miffed because I can't use it for photos in 2 weeks."
4.0,My friends kids were impressed:) OK for the children.
4.0,Nice and fashionable and good for the money.  The only not-so-good thing in my opinion is that it looks somewhat inexpensive.  I've gotten other pieces of jewelry before that were inexpensive but yet looked like more!
4.0,"Buen producto al que espero sacarle mayor provecho on la nueva actualización del sistema iOS, compre este ya que son 3 por un precio similar al de 1, así mis hijos también pueden usarlos"
4.0,"It’s made of quality material, very sturdy but a little too big (about 4 inches) and heavy for my liking. However, it does its purpose and I just keep my car with me and store my other keys in bag. No biggie!"
4.0,These are good quality glasses. The only reason that I returned them was that they were too big for my face. If they maybe had a smaller size I would consider buying them again.
4.0,Good product for the price. Found similar accessories at Claire's for far more dollars. These are better
4.0,I would have liked them better if I purchased the right size. I attempted to buy a size up thinking that they would shrink after washing.
4.0,"These underwear have a good feel to them.  Soft, and stretchy.  The underwear is light and a little lower at the hip that I prefer.  Nice quality!  Good colors.  Good feel.  I will update when I do the wash and see how they stand up to washing."
4.0,"I love this purse... I only have one complaint, the arm strap is smaller than it appears in the picture. I am hoping in time this will stretch out to make it a bit longer but other than that I love it!!! I have gotten several compliments on it already!<br />I loved this purse but in the last 2-3 months it's already falling apart. The pockets came unsone no I'm just very disappointed."
4.0,I just received them yesterday. I did not expect a criss cross back. The fit is true. I thought they’d be thicker. They’ll serve the purpose. Thank you
4.0,"On 10/18/2017 I purchased the ""Fire Orange Mirror"" lenses for one of my sets of 5-squared frames. They look great, and to date have had zero issues with defects. My only gripe is that they smudge easily. I have another set of 5-squared frames which needed replacement lenses, so I ordered the ""Ice Mirror"" lenses on 8/6/2018, and received them three days later! I expect these lenses will perform similar to my other set.<br /><br />Clarity is great, I will caution that their performance on the golf course is not as good. I seem to have depth perception issues when addressing the ball, easy fix, I simply remove them when striking the ball.<br /><br />Would be 5 stars, but they tend to smudge easily, and cleaning them is a bit of a hassle.<br /><br />All in all, I will continue to purchase Ikon replacement lenses as long as their quality remains the same."
4.0,"High end bra for low price. Panties run very small, but for the quality of the bra, I don't mind."
4.0,It’s kinda hot for an all day wear. Thick as well if you are going to be working outside in the 90 degree weather. I wore it 10 hours straight and I was ready to rip it off after the 8th hour  it held  my babies up and not bounce around good padding too.
4.0,"Very cute ,soft fits great"
4.0,the white band is a lil than expected its right on the top panty line
4.0,"nice band replacement, has a softer band than the original, but it works. nice packaging. will buy again but a different color."
4.0,"They are great shoes but order 1 size up. I returned the 1st pair I ordered, way too snug/uncomfortable."
4.0,The slip is short.
4.0,This cowboy hat is a beautiful color.<br />It was a little big and the tie inside helped a little.  It worked perfect on my friend.  It’s not hers.
4.0,"I like them, my fault because I wanted them to be baggy on me."
4.0,Very cute! My kids love it!
4.0,"This is a very pretty little kimono but it’s kind of short. When I think kimono I think longer, like past my bottom or even longer.I’m 5’8 and if it were any shorter i’d Send it back. The color is lovely. It’s darker than it appeared on my screen but still nice."
4.0,"I love this dress! The pattern is super cute and it fits beautifully.  My only complaint is the length.  I ordered a large and if I went a size up it would be too big but the length probably would be more comfortable.  I'm going to get a pair of spandex shorts to wear under it though, so I won't flash everyone every time I bend over! For size reference, I'm 5'7"" and weigh about 205.  I usually wear an XL too and size 14.  I went with the smaller size based on other reviews though."
4.0,The colour is a little brighter and shinier than I expect but the pyjamas are soft and comfortable.  Also not too clingy which I think is more flattering in my size.
4.0,"Great everyday tees! Good materiel, although they did shrink a bit in the wash so we hang dry now."
4.0,"This is a fine vest: soft, well-made, not bulky. My only complaint is that it’s SO LONG. It comes to my mid thigh, which makes me look frumpy. I wish I could find a petite length vest."
4.0,Not form fitting but complimentary fit. Would by again.  Shall see how it washes up.
4.0,Looked like a nice shirt ... but way too small.  Returned it.
4.0,purchased as a xmas present
4.0,Love the color and style. Well made
4.0,"I ordered a size small, I’m 5’6 and this dress fits just right. I wouldn’t mind it being a inch longer, I just won’t be doing any crazy dance moves in it."
4.0,"A well-made and attractive product but too big for me to carry around.  My old wallet was getting full and bulky with credit/debit cards, membership cards, discount cards, ID's, etc so I thought I needed a bigger wallet.  Turns out I just needed to downsize and only carry the cards I use the most.  I got a smaller, ""front pocket"" wallet for my main cards, and I'm just keeping my secondary cards concealed in my vehicle in the larger wallet and I just pull out those cards when I need them."
4.0,"Sturdiness for sunglasses, value"
4.0,"My daughter loves it.  Its a bit thin for winter, but overall very cute."
4.0,the tiara is wonderful the sash is too long and pinning it was a hassle.
4.0,They shed and the elastic wristband started to separate from the rest of the glove. But they served their purpose for Halloween.
4.0,"Actually it's perfect fit the style of dress it is, definitely hides my big belly"
4.0,Fit was too loose - Fabric was not as heavy as I expected
4.0,It was a little thinner than expected but the refectory for the price.
4.0,The top is a little too big. I have very large breasts but this was still a little loose for my 42e. I love the bottoms. I tightened the straps and tried to toe the back tighter still a little room left. But love this anyway. I wear 18 bottoms and 2x top on normal clothes
4.0,Love this top. Fit is great. I have this In 2 colors. I wear a tank underneath. Naturally falls off one shoulder.
4.0,"I ordered the Allimy women's summer casual v-split neck chiffon blouse based on Amazon reviews and found the blouse pretty and decent value. Usually, I wear XS clothes. I had ordered Small in this blouse, based on reviews. It fits but it's slightly snug in the shoulders. I have slightly muscular arms from lifting weights, but overall, I look very, very slim. I am 5' 5'', 112 lbs. I recommend this blouse and advise prospective shoppers to order a size up."
4.0,para jugar golf
4.0,"The bra is super comfortable and supportive, but the phone pocket doesn’t feel as secure as I hoped it to be. The wire holes make me feel a little better that my phone won’t fall out, but I’ll probably stick to using this on a treadmill/elliptical as opposed to securing my phone for long rides outside."
4.0,Nice but have to return them they send wrong size
4.0,My daughter really likes the ethnic look of these earrings.  They are very appropriate for New Mexico.  They echo a theme very appropriate for the southwest.  They are lightweight and easy to wear.
4.0,This tiara is a gorgeous gold color and have lovely flowers. My only problem with it is I was expecting it to be a headband and it wasn’t so unless you have it pinned into you hair it doesn’t stay on well. It’s extremely flexible and bendable which I guess is a positive and a negative depending on what you’re using it for.
4.0,"These are pretty tiny.  I expected them to be small, but was still surprised at how small they were.  They seem like nice quality though."
4.0,It's a little larger then I expected. But overall not bad!
4.0,"It was a bit on the small side for me, but I loved the detail on the top. A little tricky to not get tangled in all those strappy details in front, but they were cute and it was very supportive."
4.0,Smaller than expected. No elastic on the hood. Thin materials
4.0,"If ordering, choose 1 size larger. If you wear a Large, or 1X..."
4.0,I went with a size medium in the white top after reading these reviews (I’m a 34D / size 8/10 / 140lbs). It is nice and flowy and a perfect spring top. Washes well with no shrinking. The material feels like a Jersey t shirt kind of material and it lays nicely. Would also make a great maternity top. I want to buy the black one as well! Great price!
4.0,Grandes
4.0,Mine arrived before the estimated date  It is of top quality but sadly it is too small for me  So a fortunate granddaughter will get it
4.0,"4 stars because of the quality and it kept me warm & comfortable in 7degree weather. I dropped a star because of the sizing/shape. I'm 5.4/5.5 usually a size 8 and I bought a medium based on reviews that it runs small. The length of the sleeves was OK-ish (fit just to the base of the thumb which was OK but rode up to the wrist after a while), shoulders are a bit wider than I liked, and jacket length was good. I think a small would have been a better fit in the body (it also means the sleeves & jacket might have been too short). Be aware this is not a fitted jacket as the image may imply. It fits quite square so perfect for bulky clothing underneath - if that's what you intend to do the medium is perfect - but I wanted a fitted look. Anyway, as I said, good quality, quite warm and comfortable so I would recommend it anyway."
4.0,I wore this dress while on vacation. Shockingly it fit very well. I wear a size 36 DD in bras and it supported my boobs very well. When I first received it I tried it on and a small hole appeared in the seam out of no where. The material is really odd. Good thing I knew someone who could sew it up quickly.
4.0,I really like my slippers. They are comfortable and warm.  Only thing I would change is the bottoms.  They are not waterproof and cannot be worn outside.  They took at least a week to break in and during that week I was concerned I might roll an ankle (they were very fluffy on the foot pad.) Now that I have worn them to my foot I love them for puttering around the house.
4.0,"Overall good dress, nothing it is nice :) fits a little bigger than medium but is cute!"
4.0,I  wear these a lot. Very comfy. I don’t like stuff around my waist so this works great. Wish it had more/bigger
4.0,For my trip to Hawaii
4.0,Great compression qualities without skimping on comfort!
4.0,shirt no included
4.0,"I like the fit okay, but expected it to flare out more from the waist. I have a pear shaped body and hoped it would fit a bit looser in the hips. I would buy again in a size up. I must also complain about the length, I wore platform wedges to offset the length. Purchased a large, 38b, 235lbs, 5'2"
4.0,"These panties are great!! My daughter loves the designs, and I love the quality and thickness so much better than the thin panties you find in most stores. They also wash well. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of five is they run small. My daughter currently wears 4t but after reading the reviews I sized up to a 5/6. They fit great but the 4t would definitely have been too small. I will definitely buy these again."
4.0,"These leggings were so unbelievably soft and comfortable! I only gave it 4 stars because it runs somewhat smaller than the leggings I'm used to. If I was another size up I don't think the plus size would have fit comfortably and while i am definitely plus size, I am not beyond plus size - sized. For another company I fit perfectly in their PS. I can even squeeze in their OS but they are tight. Wish it was labeled roughly what pants sizes fit into each size. But overall I really loved them!"
4.0,Fabulous find look and feel great
4.0,Very Hot
4.0,So far my husband like it :)
4.0,"Just perfect for the ballet lesson of our 4 years all, but not for an older girl, too small"
4.0,Compact with multiple compartments. Worth buying
4.0,but I think washing it more will help with the stiffness. Having said the negatives I do like the look and would not be opposed to buying more.
4.0,"Nice feel, pretty. Don’t bring near water or wear every day."
4.0,"I will definitely be wearing this during winter time. It is definitely a fashion statement, bigger than expected, and great material. Although I liked the text size and material I did not like how easily the faux fur transferred to my shirt. Perhaps the materials together conflict. Either way it is a lovely fashion statement piece!"
4.0,"Great gloves, but the 2 count is misleading. I always purchase gloves in pairs, so when i only received a right and a left glove i was kind of disappointed."
4.0,"Great item and arrived as pictured. Only four stars because all I really needed was the clasp part but the pin would not budge to remove it, so I had to replace the whole link."
4.0,"It's super cute but definitely too small for my chest. I ordered a medium. I wear a 34D and they were hanging out of the side, but everywhere else fit. I ordered the large and it comes in today so I am hoping this works because it's soooo cute!"
4.0,"Great price. Not too snug. Feels like too much padding in the crotch.<br />Today I’ll try them with relatively thin CompressionZ shorts underneath.<br /><br />If that’s the ticket for me, I might come back to update this…"
4.0,Very cute outfit. Fit was true to size. Stinger is hilarious.
4.0,"I love the belt, but it did fall apart after 2 months"
4.0,"This was more comfortable than the similar sports bras I've gotten from SYROKAN; the fabric is thinner and more flexible but still provides great support. It's my favorite sports bra now. I'm a 34DDD/E and ordered a large - it fits perfectly. Only complaint is that the seam under the arm rubs a bit after extended wear. Other than that, its a great sports bra."
4.0,"A nice design, but the quailty could be better.  Personally, I wouldn't mind wearing these wearing them on an everyday basis. But depending on the recipient, it might not be gifting quality."
4.0,It is fun active wear.  Wicks sweat.
4.0,Love the swear shirt.. nice fabric vibrant colors..<br /> It was just too small. I should of ordered a size or two up.. other than that cool sweatshirt..
4.0,Not exactly what I was looking for in a jogger. But they are very nice.<br /><br />Very comfy joggers.
4.0,Wish it had a tie to tighten hood...
4.0,this hat was recommended by a friend... I saw it and ordered one for myself
4.0,being all leather my feet slide in them a little.  May get better with wear.
4.0,I really liked it and wore it for a work event. Looked very simple and classy. You can dress it up with jewelry.
4.0,the men liked the wallet
4.0,"The bracelet is very nice & it was inexpensive.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the charm fell off & I lost it the first time I wore it.  It is not a major problem tho because I make jewelry & I have those charm & just replaced it.  Otherwise, I love it!!"
4.0,Perfect lightweight hoodie for trick or treating with the kids.
4.0,"I loved the color and I loved the fit of the waist but the length was tricky for me to figure out I initially ordered a small and the length came above my Ankles I then ordered the large and it barely touched the floor (barefoot) I'm 5'5 and normally wear a size 0 or 2 in pants, I could have probably pulled off an xl but I decided to keep the large, I really liked the skirt though"
4.0,"When it arrived one of the ends was broken but, I tied it off and now i wear it all the time."
4.0,"It’s very fitted and short in the torso.<br />Order a size up, otherwise well made."
4.0,These are well made and sturdy but don’t cover the wings like advertised.  Great for the backs !
4.0,The dress fits prefect
4.0,These slacks are okay.<br />They do seem a little small for the size listed.<br />Stretch is minimal (so don't rely on them fitting you).<br />The fake pocket is just weird.
4.0,The sleeves are a little bit too long on me but might be ok for people with longer arms
4.0,This was a pretty nice costume piece. Quality is pretty good and I'm glad I bought it. I swapped out the chain for another as the chain that came with it was way too long for me.
4.0,"It looks so fancy, I love it. I'm a size 6 and it fits me perfectly."
4.0,"I love these panties, but should have gotten the smalls instead of mediums. I'm a size 8 jean and they are a touch too big for me. The cotton is soft and the lace is a nice touch for the detail. Quality of the panties is great!"
4.0,"Bought this because of the ponytail “hole” in the hat! Good coverage, the hole is a bit small for an average ponytail but workable. The fabric is a bit thin. Would have liked it to be a bit heavier."
4.0,Very good quality but was a little too snug.
4.0,"This suit is really nice. The material is thicker than some cheap suits that you find and it feels like a very nice quality suit. The fit was perfect for me, which was a total shock.  I am size 16/18 40 DD and it fit great. I will put an inch dart in the back because it is slightly loose but other than that...I am 100% pleased! And for $21...you just cannot beat that. I ordered red and the color is beautiful."
4.0,Little bit too hevy
4.0,"Nice quality shoes, but they ran very big. I had to return mine for a smaller size."
4.0,"very nice structured watch,nice lock, but was advertised to keep working for 36 hours after you take it off,it only work for 8 or 9,so you will have to adjust the time every time you use the watch,but for the price can not expect more."
4.0,It's difficult finding GMU items on the Internet.  Glad I found this travel mug and love the color.
4.0,"The fabric doesn't feel super high quality or anything, but they're cool to wear and the pockets are pretty great. Very comfy."
4.0,Grandson loves this raincoat. The raincoat and rain boots was two different color green
4.0,Like. Ordered a bigger size. Tight in the upper arm/shoulder area. Tore up on my first day of wearing it.
4.0,"I like that they get darker and lighter, but they have met my standards"
4.0,Love the charm.  The chain broke the second time I wore it.
4.0,Clips are working good for me. I attached them to pilgrim clips for trolling Lake Erie.<br />Time will tell if the springs will hold up.
4.0,These are really shorts like named in the title (the actual name will have the review rejected).  I am plus size and the 2X fit.  However; they are a little too high for me personally to wear out in public. I am wearing these for sleep though and they are really comfortable.
4.0,I thought they would be bigger but they are detailed and beautiful
4.0,I like how it is made its very pretty color but shows every roll around my back .
4.0,fairly good quality though fabric is prone to pulls (don't let it contact velcro!)..  Daughter does not wear is on hot days; not enough ventilation. would buy again.
4.0,I wore this for Easter Sunday because I was directing the choir at church. I received many many compliments on this dress. It is a bit small in the bust area. i am a DD and had to safety pin the gaps closed. I also wore it without a bra. I have to say it was very supportive. It is flattering and forgiving through the waist. The skirt is nice and full. I am 5'1&#34; and it hit right bow the knee. Modest yet flirtatious.
4.0,"Bought this for my mom for a Kentucky Derby party....she was one of the best dressed at the party. The dress fit her nicely and she said the fabric was decent, but could have been a little softer."
4.0,Husband loves watch. I'm not in love with the band but still a nice looking watch.
4.0,"Christmas Gift for a friend who either walks to work or ride his scooter. (20 miles @ 4:30 a.m. 5 days/week)  He is always concerned motorist will not see him in the dark at a such a early dark hour, but with lessen concerns he continues to wear these vest in the afternoon.  The price for multiple vest was the best price and gives him greater confidence for such a long endeavor."
4.0,"**EDIT**<br />In my original post I issued 3 stars, because one of the chokers arrived defective (oxidized). However, their customer service was quick to contact me for assistance. I'm adding another star, because I do appreciate their concern and customer service."
4.0,these are for a gift
4.0,"This sweater is perfect for casual wear. It's synthetic, so it's easy to care for and the tri-color lets me wear turtle necks inside that matches one of the stripes or I can go without an inner layer. It's relatively warm, I was able to wear it outside w/o a jacket (until the sun went down). For the price, it's a super deal!"
4.0,"I had another hoodie, that fits me perfect, and used that one to measure this one. When it arrived, the measurements are slightly smaller (about 2 inches smaller). So take than into consideration when selecting which size to request. Other than that, when hoodie is perfect and comfortable."
4.0,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the dress runs a little large.  I am 5'5 and a small was the perfect length for me."
4.0,"These feel great! The pouch inside cradle my manhood just right, without riding/bunching up. Only reason I’m not giving a five star is because I do not know how long they will last."
4.0,"It's a cute little pendant. It doesn't look TOO cheap but I mean, it's like $15 so whatta'ya ganna do?"
4.0,"My 2 yr old loves it. Holds a bunch of toys, snacks are separate and fits on her back."
4.0,"I liked theses glasses very much, fit perfect. I needed glasses that wrapped around my eyes, because I had eye surgery."
4.0,"This dress has a retro charm with the lace neck and wood look buttons. The fabric is thin and stretchy. The pockets, while useful, protude adding unwanted width to the hips. It is comfortable. I am not a fan of 3/4 length sleeves but overall the dress is cute and decently made."
4.0,Tight on larger calves
4.0,I love this dress!! Very flattering too.
4.0,gave it to my granddaughter for her birthday.  likes it very much
4.0,"These are nice chunky boots they look their picture and seem to be pretty sturdy! The only qualm I kind of have is that they come pretty tightly strung so if you have thicker calves it might be an issue.  I know it's possible to loosen them to accommodate for that, however the lace that comes with these boots is already kind of short so the amount you can loosen it while still being able to tie a decent looking knot is fairly limited. Overall a decent boot but you might want to bring your own laces!"
4.0,"First of all... I wear to rings currently 5 of them... year round.  As a result I look for items that will never tarnish or turn my skin colors.  i leav them on for all swimming, beach, home, and work activities.  This purchase was to replace one that was very similar that broke after 10 years.  From the top it is visually identical.  It is shiney and frome experience can tell you it will get a lot of compliments.  It stacks nicely with other rings on the same toe and does not snag clothing or sheets with the prongs.  Shipping was incredibly prompt.  I downgraded to 4 stars as the gold side bands are thinner than my previous bands.  I do not expect this one to last as long as the last one.  Overall, if you are looking for a 10kt toe ring that is comfortable to wear,  not seen frequently on others, and will get lots of compliments... then this is just the ring for you."
4.0,I always wear large and this fit in a large. So it’s true to size I would say. Nice comfy T-shirt material. The “red” is a purple like color. (Like it looks in the picture) Very cute and fallish!
4.0,"Solid product, only had to touch up mistitching in one or two areas. It is made in China, after all."
4.0,fast delivery service and price is reasonable. unfortunately the resin trout is very brittle and fins crack easily. one of the trout's belly fin had already cracked off before it was shipped to me. I didn't bother to return it because of the return shipping cost.
4.0,"This piece is more beautiful than the picture! It's good quality, beautiful design. Some gems had fallen off through the trip, however easy fix with some glue."
4.0,Good leg support for varicose veins
4.0,A bit different than description. But I'm very happy with it
4.0,I loved this nose ring. It’s so dainty and pretty. 8 mm is just too big and 6mm too small but they don’t make a 7mm.<br />Returned and Hoping….
4.0,"No issues in quality, just a bit small."
4.0,family tradition to give these types of pins to all of the women in the family and they are getting harder to find every year.
4.0,"These are very nice, lightweight reading glasses.  However, the gunmetal coating started pealing off of the flexible bridge after a couple months of use, so they are no longer really suitable for wearing in public.  However, I mostly use them in my home office so I will continue to use them as a backup pair."
4.0,Nice compact leather crossbody. All leather which is great for price. Only issue is that the Rose color specifically does not have the credit card slots and is not RFID.
4.0,"This is my first clothing purchase on amazon and it is an experience. By looking at the ones that posted pictures, I loved the pants. However, reading the reviews, which were plentiful and thanks, I was conflicted on what size to order.<br />I took heed to them running small and ordered a large.<br />I am a thin build with no real shape so looking at the pics where the pants looked big on some made me laugh once I tried on mine. These pants run super small. They are super cute though. I have other skinny pants but they don't fit right. They bag some.<br />I guess this is how my other pants are suppose to look on. It actually makes me look like I have a butt. I wonder how the ex large would fit but I will keep these and be self conscious on my first wear out. They are definitely not gym pants on me.<br />The are skinny pants so be mindful when ordering. I am tall and slim with no hips. They are cute on. The bottom hits the top of my ankle. I am 5'7 @ 150 lbs. with skinny trim and fit legs."
4.0,"Like 'em a lot. I wear a 9, so not a small foot. These r shaped like paddles, so in white and on a sz 9 foot they look somewhat like snow shoes! I have other Tevas w a more narrow sole.  There is just something about the shape that looks paddle-like.  But they r comfy & I like them."
4.0,"really pretty color and feel, too small for me."
4.0,Buy a few sizes up. Shrinks a lot when washed. Otherwise amazing pair of loose linen overalls for lounging around. Loved them but after the first wash lost the loose fit. Might order another pair xxl so they are loose and comfy after washing.
4.0,"Where are the backs to the earrings??<br />Other than that,  beautiful."
4.0,Not meant for long torsos. I bought this and ended up giving it to a shorter friend. It was meant to be a dress but was definitely barely longer than a shirt. She looked cute in it but on me it looked like a potato sack.
4.0,"Lovely dress, nice thicker fabric so I don't need to wear a slip if I dont want to. Honestly would have given 5 stars but the second button on the dress was missing when I got it out of the packaging and there is not a replacement or spare button in the packaging."
4.0,still nice for price
4.0,"Cute hat, you will definitely be getting compliments if you decide to get it. The only thing is that the black studs were chipped and someone went over it with a black marker, wasn't noticeable at a glance but I pay meticulous attention to all my statement pieces.. I didn't bother to return it cause it wasn't that serious. Great fit and actually came a day earlier than the time it said it would if my memory serves me right."
4.0,"Very boho chic coverup. I'm petite (5'2&#34;) and it's quite roomy & long, but I love it. The unfinished edges are part of the design. It comes with a nice cloth bag for storage."
4.0,"My daughter normally wears a 4T so I went w the 3/4 bc she’s on the smaller side, only 33 lbs. The dress fits and will work great for her preschool graduation that is royal blue themed. There are missing sequins, bad stitching at the zipper and plastic string sticking out of the bottom , but it fits and I’m on a time restriction so it will work.<br /><br />Update : I washed this once on hold and hung it dry. The clear ""fishing wire"" that is around the tulle of the dress completely came apart and the tulle ripped in many places. I ended up cutting off a few tulle layers. Luckily graduation  is over and any wear from here would just be for play."
4.0,"Thin, very cute and comfortable. I did not size up. Some reviews say they do sell but initially I ordered a size larger and it was huge!"
4.0,"I love these slippers! Initially when they arrived the slippers seemed to small. So I spent the first few weeks stretching them out. Now, after 4 months they fit very well.<br /><br />The hard sole makes walking around outside for quick things like getting the paper or checking the mail more convenient then changing into shoes.<br /><br />Great product!"
4.0,Works good and easy to use when I need to
4.0,Its a little snug BUT still fits and totally sexy!
4.0,It's very comfy but i ordered an XL really need L . hoping once i wash and dry it will shrink some. You may need to order a size down. Over all its worth the money.
4.0,"As others have noted - this bra runs SMALL.  I run between 32 and 34 DD, and went for a 34 F - and it is a bit snug on the last fastener, but I figure it will stretch, so not a huge issue there.  The cup size is about right going up one cup size.  So - all in all, reading the reviews helped me size correctly .  In my experience, you go up a cup size and a band size, and you should be OK.<br /><br />So - the bra itself.  It is not a hugely supportive bra - you won't want to go jogging in it, but as a wear around the house, or wear out, it is fine.  I found it more supportive (and way less $$$) then the Cosa Bella bras, AND with a better range of sizes, and adjustable straps.  It is a pretty bra - lacey and elegant.  Make sure you have the tag laying flat, or it is rough, but as long as you smooth it flat, it is fine (and I'm pretty sensitive to that kind of stuff).<br /><br />I would consider buying again, although I might go up a band size."
4.0,Nice  cushion
4.0,"The product itself was beautiful as in the picture, but the gift packaging could be much better than a cheap cardboard box. I used a Pandora box from a previous purchase at a jeweler."
4.0,fits cute
4.0,"It took me a few tries to get it on correctly, but I do like the design. I am a 36D and it holds my girls up pretty well! I’m pretty surprised at how much I like this bra"
4.0,This bag looks great and cute but it's quite heavy than I thought. but generally it is a good quality and good looking bag!
4.0,They straight 👍👍👍
4.0,It fits well and doesn’t fog up my glasses
4.0,Super comfortable. A little bit more elegant that I expected. But it really beautiful.
4.0,"i like but i have to return, have loose a something"
4.0,"I exchanged this for a small and at first I bought a large per the size chart but way to big. super cute though cant wait to get the small in. definitely size down 1 size as least. I am 36D 5'6"" athletic build 150#"
4.0,I usually wear medium so I bought it and had to return it n now the small fits perfect.
4.0,Small Around the arms
4.0,I love these shades!! I get a lot of compartments when I have them on. A like of people tell me that I look like a celebrity! : - )
4.0,"I would prefer an elastic waist, rather than a drawstring. Other than that I love these jeans. Comfortable and nice looking."
4.0,Like the skirt a lot except for the short liner underneath. It doesn’t have as much give as the skirt so it kind of rides up. I may just cut the liner out so I don’t have to pull it down.
4.0,"This is a comfy, soft casual shirt.  In the photo it looks like it might be more like a sweatshirt than a shirt.  It is definitely made of soft, nice, tee-shirt material.  Very comfortable to wear and I am happy about the longer length than most t-shirts."
4.0,"Very cool, funky look. Lightweight, and a little bigger and a lot darker than I thought they'd be, and a little difficult to adjust the nose pieces for a good fit. Four stars for the look and the price, but don't expect B&L quality. That said, I wore them all day today driving in bright sunlight and didn't notice an aberrations, color shifts or distortion. One last thing: Mine came thrown in the box with a pair of shoes, so the lenses had a very small scratch. Not a big deal but thought I'd mention it."
4.0,I love these. They are not huge but a really good size. Lots of compliments. I should also note that I have sensitive ears and these do not bother me.
4.0,"These socks are so soft & comfy, my child actually kept them on his feet and he’s not a fan of socks lol. Looks thicker to wear for more colder weather though."
4.0,Very pretty and warm scarf! I’m wearing it today!
4.0,"Good product for the price. If you're looking for a cape that closes in the front, this ain't it, but it hangs well and I got a lot of compliments on it."
4.0,"Good fit, flowing like you want a cardigan to be. The print is nice and also slimming. Lightweight fabric. Not the best quality but...not even close to the worst. I think it’ll make it through a few seasons and it laundries well with no shrinking that I noticed."
4.0,I love owls the color is nice and I love the set
4.0,"Got this for my wife. Fits well, looks good, but one of the pockets started to come loose in a relatively short amount of time."
4.0,"Long dress and bodice are more suitable for large breasts.  The straps cannot be tightened so that it fits under a small chest.  Very beautiful color, material and sequins on the bodice, but chose another dress for guest wedding"
4.0,"The print is very cool and so far they are washing and wearing well, but they are BIG. I have a smallish head and they pretty much slide right off my head. I would recommend them for a larger head for sure."
4.0,Great sweater! Perfect for work
4.0,really cute!  I have ordered several of these tiny cheap watches.  Be prepared to have to replace the battery right away.
4.0,This is very nice but I am sending it back I read where you needed to buy two sizes larger because it runs small it was too big for me so I would suggest to buy the size that you wear
4.0,My daughter loves her boots. She wears them all the time. I almost wish I bought her a second pair.
4.0,My wife really likes this piece as an adornment on her purse. She was a little worried about losing some rhinestones even though they seem well placed and bonded.  She does tend to sling her purse all over the place banging it into things so I simply sprayed the flower with a couple of coats of clear lacquer to help bond the stones in place. Happy wife.
4.0,"I bought this watch several months ago and am very happy.  The watch is stunning.  Other reviews indicated some brittleness issues which have not occurred with mine, and I  am not easy on the watch. Customer service has been excellent with a small problem resolved quickly and completely  to my satisfaction.  Appearance is awesome.  The only downgrade is the watch is on the small side.  I'd buy it again."
4.0,"My daughter thinks there is not enough room between each end of ring, however this may be user error :-) ."
4.0,"Just received and started wearing the belt.  The belt appears to be of good quality, but it is really too soon to know how it will hold up."
4.0,Its difficult to tell what the sizes are they come so jumbled and i think i got 1 6g and 3 4g. Im not sure but it
4.0,As expected from most other CUPSHE suits this does have Asian sizing so size up!
4.0,They were delivered fast and everything I thought they would be
4.0,pretty and fun
4.0,The cost for a three-pack is awesome.  Not so awesome is that the medium runs small.  I returned for larger size.  Package was delivered in a timely manner.  Returning and getting a refund was easy.<br /><br />Good for cost and feel of material.  Bonus is the pocket to put my cell in while working out.
4.0,They are cute and look just like pictures didn’t give it five starts because the size are a little off. But overall great product
4.0,"This was extremely pretty on. Only downfall don't get it wet, will stretch out. Besides that, a must buy!!!"
4.0,"Soft, thin, fit well inside of other gloves. One of the seams sits on the inside of the thumb and is a little annoying, but not bad."
4.0,Very cute but it was quite small on my head. Then again I was wearing a wig and I just have a naturally big head lol. Good quality though!
4.0,These are absolutely adorable! They look just like the picture & feel like they are durable (not super thin yet also not too thick for warmer weather). If you are taller than 5'7&#34; they may not be long enough.
4.0,"Cute but way too big,  I don't like how the stitching makes a line directly down the front so I will not be exchanging for another size"
4.0,Came as described and fit well. My only complaints is the collar is too low and wide/open. I prefer a bit more neck coverage. Especially to je worn hunting.
4.0,"Fitted but other reviewers said to order up a size  - glad I did. Color is pretty, looking forward to wearing it"
4.0,They are great glasses just a little big for my face I still wear them and the look great.
4.0,"Not bad for an inexpensive watch.  The vinyl band (it's not leather as another reviewer stated) feels solid if a bit cheap. Don't expect it to last long, but for an inexpensive watch you could do worse."
4.0,"I bought these for my sister. She ended up leaving these at my house. Pro, tons on variety. Cons, yiu get what you pay for. Do these leave your ears green sometimes? You betcha! Is there an easy fix for that? Yup! Overall, not bad. I've used these a lot surprisingly."
4.0,"I really love these socks! They are super cute and look great with boots. I have found that I can’t wear them alone, like around the house because they tend to twist around the food and the heel part ends up on the side of my foot. I’m not really sure why. Still worth the money though!"
4.0,"What a gorgeous shoulder wrap! There's just a few improvements that can be done on this.<br />1) The slot used to slip one end through the other, is not wide enough. The end that slips through, appears bunchy, and odd. It was better off being held on both ends.<br />Other than that, its a beautiful wrap, and it made my birthday photo shoot complete!"
4.0,Great hat! So warm and soft. A bit expensive but worth it when it is -15` outside. There is a fur-like material inside the rim of the hat that is just so comfortable/ luxurious.
4.0,Good price and polarized!
4.0,"My wife loves charms and loves Broadway, so this was a great Christmas gift for her. Arrived earlier than expected, and the quality is good to excellent. There are mini Playbills and a little charm related to the show. Most of them are very apt, for example, the Beauty and the Beast playbill has a charm depicting the rose under glass from the show. The Joseph...Dreamcoat charm is Joseph’s coat. However a couple of them are puzzling: the charm for School of Rock is a violin, and the charm for Newsies is the Bible (?)... For this reason, I’m giving it four stars instead of five."
4.0,This was a cute and inexpensive costume. 4/5 stars because it did fall apart after 2 washes.
4.0,This item was on my daughters wish list.  It shipped fast and the price was perfect.  I like that it is small and no piercing.
4.0,After 5 years I am buying a new one. It no longer comes clean when washed but it had a good run. My suitcase still looks new after at least 20 flights.
4.0,I have not had it on in the water yet but so far it’s super cute and comfy!<br />I love the tie back actually meets almost together so covers but doesn’t cling!
4.0,"Mixed feelings about this watch. It seems to be well made but I find very few vendors selling this watch online and can't find any info about it on hamilton's site. I have doubts if this is an authentic Hamilton or a good looking knock off.<br /><br />My only complaint about the actual watch is that the second hand doesn't align well with the minute markers on the dial. I've read this is a common issue with quartz movements, even on more expensive watches."
4.0,Bought these has a gift for my sister. They are light and can be worn with any outfit. Simple and stylish at the same time :-)
4.0,Very comfortable. Little wide.
4.0,super cute! Plan to wear it as a tunic
4.0,"great quality, front gets a little stuck together when folded."
4.0,"I love them! I have a small waist and large hips and they fit beautifully. Minus one star because they are not true to the color in the photograph, the tie dye is blues, brown and white as opposed to blue and purple. Still, they're shift and we'll made and I'm happy to keep them as is."
4.0,It's very cute! Just a little long but she'll grow into it.
4.0,"I used them mostly for work as I'm on my feet 13 hrs a day.  They are hard to get on, but that's the point. My legs didn't feel as tired or achy after wearing these socks and they're cute!"
4.0,Looked great. Gift for my grandson. He hasn't received it yet but sure he will like it
4.0,"I like the material. It’s very soft and stretchy. The length is good too, down to my ankles. However, the waistline is a bit loose on me, but it can be fixed with a tucked-in blouse or a thicker top."
4.0,Im 5'3&#34; and about 118 lbs. I'm usually a small but ordered a medium since it said &#34;Asian sizes&#34;.  The medium is too big.
4.0,"This dress is beautiful and was of better quality than I was expecting. The material has a good thickness to it along with a bit of a texture. It lays well against the body. I ordered a Large. My dimensions are approximately: Bust 36"", Waist 32"", Hips ""42, Height: 5'4"". I was glad I ordered a Large for the hips. The material is very stretchy and I am glad I did not order a smaller size. The dress hits me about mid-knee. The top still fits well even though the sizing indicates it may be a bit big.<br /><br />Where the proportions are off are in the arms and shoulders. Typically, I never wear 'Large' tops. I typically only wear mediums or smalls. Even with the Large size, the shoulders are a bit narrow for me. The arm holes are a bit small. I am worried that the small arm holes and shoulders will cause bunching in shoulders. The head hole is a bit tight, but is fine on the neck once on. The rest of the dress is fine, but the shoulders and arms seem a bit small by comparison to the rest of the dress.<br /><br />In general, the dress is very nice. I recommend ordering according to hip size if you tend to have wider hips."
4.0,Looks great and fits perfectly and held in place with a screw which is fantastic... Only issue is the case and the handle appear to be 2 different colors and grains of leathers. Other than that I am pleased!
4.0,Get lost of compliments on this dress but a bit small in the chest area have to readjust a lot.
4.0,The only issue I had with these gloves is that they wore down pretty quickly. I do merchandising for a beer company so I’m constantly using the gloves and needing them to stack up cases of beer. It on average one pair would last maybe three weeks. Which kind of sucks so I wouldn’t recommend them for every day use but they did fit my hands really really well and I have a small hand.
4.0,"Nice soft feel, hangs nicely and I'm a phat girl so that's not easy to do.  Thin, but expected that."
4.0,"Expected a bit thicker material, but it's ok. Came with a belt. Nice color."
4.0,"Great little poncho, very attrative. I gave this as a gift to my MIL in OKC and she loved it. About the quality of Maurices, or ShopKo."
4.0,A bit more thin than what I expected. Still wpuld be good for summer.
4.0,Super cute. The leg holes were a little large for my daughter but she wear shorts over it.
4.0,"Was hoping they would be a shade lighter brown like the Maui Jim version, but functionally they work great."
4.0,"I was torn on getting a L or XL, to be on the safe side I got an XL. It's kind of big, but I can tie the front of the shirt and it looks cute like that. Material is soft and comfortable."
4.0,"These are great socks. I don't find that my legs feel better after a workout compared to wearing regular socks, but these are still good workout socks. I revived them for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I think that the fit is very very tight (and I have slim legs) so they may not be comfortable for someone with thick legs. I found that it required a bit of effort to get them on, but they were comfortable workout socks because they don't fall down, they are cushioned enough to make my feet comfortable in my shoes, and they absorb lots of sweat. I would recommend them."
4.0,"I love it and it’s cute, but the chain keeps opening up and my key falls off. Literally all the time. I ended up using superglue to keep the chain from popping open anymore."
4.0,Great product. Was as listed in the add.
4.0,These earrings are very nice for the price of then. They are classy and pretty. I rated them a 4 only as on one of them the plating has started to chip slightly and I’ve had them for several weeks.
4.0,I wished these boardshorts would have fit because I love the style.  They are not for a curvy pant size 10 woman.  I am pretty normal sized at 5&#34;6&#34; 145 lbs. athletic build but I do have a booty.  The two piece look is really different and I really am disappointed that the large short was too small for me.  If they were to rethink the sizing and possibly expand their choices more women like myself could enjoy their product.
4.0,"Great deal and roomy. Wish it had a little more structure, but it’s nice."
4.0,"They work perfectly, The color seems much brighter than I expected.  They do the job."
4.0,Evening event
4.0,"Pretty bracelet, especially for the price! The only reason I wasn't totally happy with it, is because it is advertised as adjustable, but it isn't. It's not closed, so it can be stretched open, but I have very small wrists and was under the impression that it could be shaped/ adjusted small. It is way too big for me, so I had to return it."
4.0,After a few wears the charm pops off and the bracelet falls off but they are very pretty and good for the price
4.0,"Good quality, but they definitely run small. I'd recommend buying a size up, even after measuring and determining that the right size for your child."
4.0,"I am a musician and occasionally like a little more bling... I have worn this twice, have gotten compliments. It's a nice looking bracelet, a little flashy but not over the top for my needs. I think it could also be work for an evening at a dance club or other outing. I don't know how well it will hold up over time, but no more than I will wear it, for the price I think it's a winner.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/2018: I have worn it 3 times. The last time, it turned my wrist green. It has never gotten wet and has always been stored properly. So, it definitely is not durable!"
4.0,The skirt doesn't match its like a bright red color but it's still a cute outfit I just wish whatever the model wears they ACTUALLY SELL THAT'S ALL
4.0,"Really cute ring. First I was worried that it may be to big, but the elastic band stretches and is small enough to fit my 8 year old."
4.0,Look ok
4.0,So the bottin wholes were to small and I had to cut them into size so the bottins could fit.There we’re some  lose steching and it was I little to big but other than that it has been my favorite cosplay out of all of the ones I’ve had.
4.0,picked these glasses up today to put on and the frame broke and the lense fell out
4.0,"It is adorably tiny. Still a crystal though, I think."
4.0,Very pretty and great earrings for the second or third whole
4.0,"They look great, my wife is passing them out to her friends, but they need a filter insert to be more functional"
4.0,"I like you products, keep up the good work."
4.0,"I really like the material this is made of: soft, smooth, and moves nicely over your skin. I have athletic shoulders, butt, and thighs so I ordered a large knowing I could always have a tailor take in the waist (which I'll definitely have to do). The top is cut conservatively, perfect for the office. It can be worn year round, just add a cardigan or blazer if it's chilly. For reference, my measurements are 38-29-41, 5'7"", usually a size 6 in pants, medium top."
4.0,Its too thin for the price. But very nice so far.
4.0,"Fabric is kinda cheap but what you'd expect for the price. Fits great, and is super cute on. Picture in the listing is pretty accurate."
4.0,"Comfortable and good quality. I ordered these for post breast augmentation.  I ordered the 3 pack of nude, grey, and black. The black and nude fit much looser than the grey. It’s like they are a size larger than the grey. I needed them to fit pretty snug like the grey but Imgood thing I’ll ‘grow’ in to them. They are made well and very comfortable material."
4.0,"Nice, stylish product, good red color.  It ran just a bit on the large size for me, and I returned; however, I may look for a smaller size in the future and order it."
4.0,"Really cute, well-made bag, thoughtful storage pockets, padded protection, seems waterproof, easy to carry. Unfortunately too small for me. If you go by the stated dimensions 11.8&#34; x 8.3&#34; x 4.7&#34; (W x H x D), it's somewhere around there, but don't go by the stated volume (12L) because it's much less than this. Also the side pockets barely fit a water bottle. I like to stay hydrated so I tend to carry a behemoth thermos around, but even my blender bottles didn't fit. I have a small water bottle that does fit, but I can only use one side pocket at a time while carrying a couple small notebooks and my kindle inside. Great organization for all the little things I need, but ultimately not enough room for my purposes so it's going back. May be perfect for your needs though."
4.0,"I usually wear a small and I got a small but it fits like a medium. I wish it were a bit more slim-fitting. I took a big gamble and decided to wash it, hoping it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't at all so now I cannot return it either. I guess I'll find a way to make it work somehow by compromising on the size. I like everything else about it."
4.0,"I really liked this coat, it looks just like the pictures. I only returned it because I needed a thicker coat. It’s very thin and light. Would be great for fall. Order a size up if you want a little looser."
4.0,Great shoes! They look much better in person than in the pictures even. I accidentally ordered a half-size bigger than what I usually wear so I did mark them as somewhat small but they would probably stretch a bit and be fine. Great shoes at a great price!
4.0,"It's good for its price, I would say. Initially I was quite disappointed by the rough surface of the hankies when I first received them. But they feels okay after washing, though one of its corner with lace is very fragile. Anyway, I ultimately decided not to return them since they are very handy after all."
4.0,Love my pair! Ive always just used regular trouser socks to work my 12 hour shifts and my kegs would hurt at the end of my shift. Not withthese!! They are giving me the leg support i needed!  I still jave the energy to go to the gym nowadays after my work day!!
4.0,"A bit big, but it'll look great with leggings. And it has pockets!!!!"
4.0,Like the fact that it is loose and comfortable. Somewhat pills up after several washings. Gets very wrinkles after being in the suitcase.
4.0,Wish I would have gotten a size smaller but still looks adorable. Numerous compliments and the material is so amazingly airy.
4.0,They work very well
4.0,"So far they are more than expected, have neuropathy in hands and they are helping to keep them warm but still able to get fingers out when necessary"
4.0,it was okay.
4.0,High quality products. I really enjoyed them
4.0,Other than plugging the shoes into a usb... They are pretty great and we get compliments wherever we go!
4.0,"I was very pleased with these charms.  The only thing I didn't like, it did not have the true Autism colors, green, blue, yellow and red."
4.0,I’m a caregiver so these were the perfect addition to my badge!! My clients loved them
4.0,This was a gift to my eight-year-old granddaughter and all in all it’s an excellent product. I was surprised at how well the Cape was made but she was disappointed that the white rabbit was not included.
4.0,It’s exactly whA I wanted and expected
4.0,"ORDER A BIGGER SIZE! I had read the reviews and comments on the size and ordered up 3 sizes. I am glad I did because anything less, the dress would not have fit. This dress is BEAUTIFUL and even flattering on my bigger size. I didn't feel self conscious or uncomfortable at all and I actually thought I would because it is form fitting. You can wear this dress with sandals and make it casual or put on a pair of heels and make it classy. The material is soft and does have some stretch, but not enough if you don't pay attention and order accordingly. This is perfect for a night out with friends or to wear to a wedding. I am happy to have this dress in my closet.<br /><br />**Disclaimer- I was offered this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review**"
4.0,"Love the product, I ended up ordering a size larger than normal. I'm glad I did because it allows me enough space to wrap comfortably over my shoulders in order to use it both ways. My only complaint, the length is standard and I'm short. It drags on the ground when worn over a skirt unless I hike it up or wear tall heels. Still beautiful though."
4.0,Didn’t realize it was dri fit
4.0,"Had some issues with the solar lights but the issue was finally resolved.  In regards to my comments on May 7th,  everything is to my satisfaction.  The umbrella is great for the price. Suggestion, keep the umbrella part out of outdoor elements when not in use to preserve the life of material."
4.0,"Just received this. It's a bit looser than I was expecting. I have a smallish head...5'3&#34; female with fine hair. However, it's not too loose and the silicone/rubber on the inside seems to keep it in place and It's not so tight as to cause a headache. Glad I got it."
4.0,"Beautiful shirt, soft and supple. I had to return however due to the arm/sleeves being to small"
4.0,It hurts a little but I luv the style
4.0,"UPDATE: One wash on delicate and air dried and this frayed and tattered and looks like it’s 10 years old.. ugh, junk.<br /><br />This is an inexpensive bralette and I like that it's padded so that the girls don't poke through. I am 34C and got a medium and it fits perfectly. The lace is pretty, but I thought I was getting pink and it's def more peach."
4.0,Amazing price and quality. Nephew loved them.
4.0,"It's a good shirt, but a little on the small side. I decided a medium would work much better for me.<br />Material is good and quite comfortable."
4.0,my sone loves it and it can also be worn as pj's.
4.0,The glasses are light weight and look good. The bifocal line is a little high for me but i make it work. Great value!
4.0,"Really cute, and fits well except in the chest. I got my normal size, but this thing crushes my chest and doesn't have much support (no other bathing suits do either, but this is a bit uncomfortable)."
4.0,Cute but doesnt hold up heavy stuff. My strap broke after having it for 2 days. ill have to sew it my hand but its still really cute and goes with my outfits well
4.0,"A most interesting bra. The fit is a little too tight. The fabric, a very pretty black lace with subtle green thread running through it is a trifle scratchy. Some of the decorative edging is out of whack. More to the point, the bra has a standard back closure with two additional panels almost identical to the back attached to the outside of the cups that fasten in front with the same sort of hooks-and-eyes closure as the back. This does hold things snugly, adding cleavage but who wants the back of the bra in front? There is no panel or tag to conceal this strange apparatus, which derails somewhat the foo foo lace and frippery of the bra's face. Whoever designed this is conflicted between function and intention. I am keeping it as I find it something of a lingerie wonder of the world..."
4.0,I really like it. It's easy to hold. You have to get use to using it though--it takes some practice but once you figure it out it's really easy. I use it for coins and its better than the other one I bought that came with a light.<br /><br />It also literally arrived the next day after I ordered it.<br /><br />It lost a star with me because the plastic case broke.
4.0,More sheer than expected
4.0,It is really cute.<br />We've be collecting them for years.<br />Same durable quality as the rest of ours.
4.0,"This bracelet is absolutely beautiful and a lovely simplistic yet meaningful piece of jewelry. The printed words are good and the metal is mostly even, there is just one raised bump but it is not too noticeable. The reason I marked it four stars instead of five was that you cannot open or adjust the bracelet. It goes on my thin wrists but it sometimes falls off. I still like the bracelet and it is good quality for the price. Its is very meaningful to me as someone who suffers from mental illness."
4.0,Great sneaker! very comfortable & stylish. I get a lot of compliments.
4.0,"Beautiful, however hair catches around the clasp."
4.0,"Super cute dress! I wore it to my dad's wedding and got a lot of compliments. It was a little shorter than I anticipated and it's pretty low cut, but nothing obscene. Size up if you're large chested"
4.0,This is a really cute top.  The waist is a little narrow but not so much it keeps me from wearing it.
4.0,Works well for mustache & goatee. The extra hold does work better to last throughout the day.
4.0,"I love this dress! Every time I wear it I get constant compliments from complete strangers. I love the fabric, but the stitching of seams were not good. I washed it once and wore it yesterday to find some seams opening already. I love the dress so much that I will get the sewing kit out to fix it! That’s big for me because usually I just donate at that point."
4.0,"It was a bit thinner then I would have liked but it did look great and the person I but it for was extremely happy with it, I definitely recommend it but I will caution it's definitely more of a hooded T-shirt LOL"
4.0,Bought this item to start piecing together a black spiderman costume. Got em at a great price. .. they fit perfect.  Now just need the rest of the costume. Ty.
4.0,I bought this for a little 7 yr old girls birthday.  She seemed to love it.  (hahaha - She also loves water; I hope she doesn't give it a bath)<br />The watch arrived on time as promised.  It was packed well.
4.0,Design looks very good but it is a very light jacket
4.0,"I bought these for my daughter for homecoming and she loves them. They are different from standard earrings which provides a more unique look but they are also clean and elegant looking. They worked well for her desire to look young and modern but classy and elegant as well. The only complaint is they can slip a bit, which is why we gave 4 stars instead of 5"
4.0,"These were adorable, and very soft in the inside. However, they were way too small. The sizing says 8, but my 7.5 feet couldn't comfortably wear these. They may stretch out after a time, but I'm not willing to try. I wish that they came in larger sizes."
4.0,"Great buy for the money. Took a chance with this dress. Purchased for 13yo daughters first communion. She is very petite, and the small was perfect. I did however took it in on the upper chest and sleeves to make it more fitted, otherwise it had a little room but not too much. The waist fitted perfect with no room to grow but that's fine. I purchased a crinoline after reading other reviews, without it, the dress will be very flat. She also wore a white under shirt. Material feels good, Mother in Law said it looked just like her own wedding dress from 1960 and was also surprised at the &#34;quality&#34; for the price and super fast shipment. The color is not true white, but very close to the true white dresses her sisters wore. It was a challenge finding affordable communion/confirmation dresses for my teens, and this was really a life saver. I saw the exact same dress at a &#34;bridal&#34; store (mostly Chinese products) on &#34;sale&#34; for 85 bucks. Glad we got her this one!!"
4.0,"This jacket is true to size, and it fits well. The material is lightweight and comfortable. I didn't notice the ""line dry"" instruction and put it in the dryer, but it came out fine."
4.0,I like the teal/green/blue color. It caught my eye immediately.
4.0,Fits great and would buy again.
4.0,"Great product. It took me a little time to figure how to get a good seal on the ear plugs, so maybe they should do a youtube video on that. Fortunately for me, I found a youtube on some other ear plugs and tried it and it worked. Would have given a 5 star if they would have given more specifics on the ear plugs. Goggles are great, not in to the nose clip so can't speak of that."
4.0,"I like this a lot, I think it's going to be really warm in the winter. But one problem I do have is the chin strap. It's way too big. Otherwise, it looks super cute on me (and on all cute girls) and it's going to be great for riding my bike on wintery days."
4.0,"Beautiful, but a bit large, I will have to adjust."
4.0,"I ended up loving the dress.  I was disappointed at first because the wrong color was sent.  I ordered pink for a beach wedding, but received a copper orange color instead. (The lighting in the wedding pic does make it look more pink)  I was going to return it, but had a Fall wedding in early October I saved it for instead.  I received a lot of complements.  It’s flattering and gives your body a good shape.  I’m about 5’5”,  38 DDD chest,  I usually wear a size 10-12 in pants and orders the XL.  If you follow the size chart it fit like a glove.  The back went to about mid claves."
4.0,It's cool Bracelet and  made well
4.0,"I've been buying and wearing these for years I like the style, nose cushion, and how they block out the sun from the sides. I'm usually buying them over and over again because I leave my glasses places or sit on them or whatever. For $20-$25 a pair I could care less right?  They are not meant to last. I don't spend much time in the sun I don't leave my sunglasses sitting in the sun. They're good for driving, good for losing, good for breaking, and a quick replacement fix. I've had worse, way worse"
4.0,I like it and it fits good
4.0,"This is a great, sturdy umbrella - automatic open and close is a real advantage."
4.0,"The coat is very warm, but can be worn 3 different ways as described. Zippers are easy to use and seem durable. Has a good amount of pockets. The outer shell is a nice water repellent material with vivid color. I gave this 4 stars because the inner fleece is a dense, non-breathable material that I'm not crazy over. Although, it's very similar to the fleece material used for some Columbia and Old Navy fleeces. The actual quality of the material is fine. That's just my preference. The biggest flaw is that the corners of the velcro are very sharp and can scratch you and the velcro sticks to EVERYTHING. Other than that, this is a great jacket that was well worth the price."
4.0,Very nice gloves I wish I they had them in a small or medium.
4.0,"Super cute and comfy. Washes well. Wish it were flannel vs cotton, but would still buy again."
4.0,"I was pleased by this pendant necklace.  The scarab was nicely done, and goes with everything I wear.  The scarab is not 'buggy looking' but more stylistic.  That is something that I do like."
4.0,.ok
4.0,"This maxi dress is just as my title describes:<br />▪︎Cute; typical ""Spaghetti straps"" style maxi dress w/ adjustable straps to customize to YOUR height AND bust preference placement; as in low cut for maximum ""cleavage"" OR higher up for ""modesty"" YOU decide, YOU adjust accordingly ▪︎Comfortable (actually Uber comfortable; soft material, stretchy, not too restricting - allows you room to move, and is very ""flowy"" at the bottom ▪︎Colorful; Nice & vivid ""tropical"" print; not too bold, not too boring, but juuussst right! (Lol) Rich tones; deep blue(s) & green(s), a smattering of pink, other light colors to balance the print. (Eye-catching and Eye-candy to those that have complimented me in it; yeah, even my ex! Shocker!!😲 Lol)<br /><br />So, WHY did I deduct one star?<br />Because the pockets (did I mention it has wonderful, glorious pockets?!🤗 Lol) ""placement"" is quite LOW on this dress. I kinda have to lean to that one side, or the other, to put/retrieve things in the pockets. NOT a deal-breaker, but just odd that they were sewn so far DOWN on both sides of the dress. (Orrr... maybe I have SHORT arms?!!😄) You'll be happy to learn that the pockets do NOT add to your hips, making you look extra ""hippey,"" I hate when garments do that! My hips DON'T need any MORE help, thank you very much!!!<br /><br />Great lil maxi; I can highly recommend! TWO Thumbs-UP!!! 👍👍<br /><br />P.S. I have a forth ""C,"" but perhaps I shouldn't mention it bc IF (BIG ""IF"") the price changes, it'll just make YOU mad!!😤 Like I get, when someone's Review says: ""Great (product) for $x.xx"" (whatever price that person paid), but when you're thinking of buying it, the CURRENT, listed doggone price is like double or even TRIPLE what that other person paid!!! 😡..Grrr! (Lol)<br /><br />Oh, what the heck, I'll mention it, bc I appreciate it when OTHER ppl ""educate"" or ""inform"" me...<br /><br />My fourth ""C"" is: Cheap...<br />Absolutely NOT in quality bc it's well made, well designed, well sewn, (& did I tell you it has: POCKETS?!!🤗 Lol), but rather, ""cheap,"" in the way of PRICE; I got it at what I consider a ""steal!"" I paid $9.99 for it. One of my BEST purchases for UNDER 10 BUCK$!!! Especially when I get compliments when I wear it! It's worth every 9,999 pennies I paid for it!!!😁😍<br /><br />HAPPY WEARING!!!🤙<br /><br />[Oops! I almost forgot! (Because I abhor/hate when ppl forget, or DON'T list theirs on purpose! It DOESN'T help others who are vacillating & struggling to decide to get it, or not, bc they DON'T have ENOUGH info to make an ""informed decision!!""😠) So, here ya' go, for YOUR reference:<br />▪︎I purchased a Medium ▪︎5ft 1in ▪︎Approx 125 - 130 lbs ▪︎Bust: 36""(b) x Waist: 30"" x Hips: 38""<br /> Yes, I'm short & petite (not bragging, just trying to help you decide! Lol) and wear 3"" heels w/ this dress; there's still about an inch to 1½ "" at dress length that kinda semi-drags on the floor. I don't mind bc I'm usually JUST ""sitting"" ALL day at my desk. I usually just lift the bottom of my dress when walking. The straps are at their highest adjustment point, fits my top half perfectly; Goldilocks: does not come up too high, nor does it hang too low. My 38"" hips @ sz: Med, sorta, kinda ""swims"" in this dress; quite roomy. The/My 30"" waist in this dress is a NON-issue, lots of room. Same w/ my bust in this dress; NON-issue. Remember in the beginning of my Review? That's what I meant about THIS dress being: UBER COMFORTABLE! (I probably could've purchased a sz: Small, but I'm NO Spring Chicken, so not in need of stuff having to look ""tight & sexy"" on me any longer. Probably would NOT have been as roomy also, and length would've been shorter & more conducive to my height, but oh, well... like the song says:<br />🎶""Love the dress you're with!!!🎵"
4.0,"Great presentation and overall look. There are two little scratches on the lens I’m a little bummed about, but these are for work and reasonably priced so I’ll work with the scratches 😔"
4.0,"Not too bad, love the cut, but don’t love the fit. The “bummer “type style is as expected, but I don’t like the way the color looks. I ordered the off-white, cream color and it sort of looks just doll and dirty from far away. The fur is fine, but nothing special. I might have ordered and enjoy the black, but it wasn’t in my size. I ordered a medium and now I would order a small I believe. Runs a little bit big. More comfortable than I thought. Zipper cheap healing. Inside better quality than I thought."
4.0,"Nice looking belt, but they must measure the buckle also as it only fitx me at the last hole.  My pants are usually 38 or 40 depending on brand."
4.0,They're very warm and mostly comfy but the waist band is too tight and I'm very thin.
4.0,"Nice quality and fits very nice, just not the color in the picture is more like a baby yellow"
4.0,"Fits well, looks strong, sits comfortably on the nose. The reason it did not get a five star, it did not come with a protective carrying pouch."
4.0,I got the lg/x lg cause it says runs small and they are still tight. Not sure what to do now. Love the look and all but tight
4.0,Adorable but had to return it because the waist came up too high. Fuller busted individuals might need to size up.
4.0,Fun shirt.  My daughter loves it.  Not the softest shirt.
4.0,I ordered this watch because it was advertised with a bracelet band ...It arrived with a expansion  band . The seller gave me a refund because there were none available with a bracelet band.....Just a beautiful watch with  the wrong band ..
4.0,I bought it too big!
4.0,"I want to start with, I love vintage cut dresses.  They really match my body shape.  I have defined waist but I have a tummy and a larger backside. I normally wear a 16W.  I ordered a 14-16 plus and it fit perfectly.  The 3/4 sleeve plaid patchwork dress does the trick and pulls in at my waist and flares out to hide the tummy and the backside.  The style is unique compared to most of the other vintage dresses available and is absolutely adorable.<br /><br />I think this dress is great.  I will end up wearing it around the house but probably not out and about that much.  The fabric is thinner than I like, and seem to get in most of the other dresses I buy.  The belt is absolutely useless. It is cute to put on and look at in the mirror but then just take it back off and throw it away.  Where the two fabric types meet the seems pucker, a lot.  The worst part is that the collar doesn't lay down. Both the collar and the cuffs are going to need to be starched and ironed every time I wash it.  This is what has turned it into a house dress instead of an out and about dress.  Why would I spend time ironing when I have a closet full of other dresses that do not take that kind of work.<br /><br />Again, this dress is so cute.  I love wearing it.  It may become one of my favorite dresses to wear around the house but it will be too much work to wear out regularly."
4.0,"I like these socks, but they're not nearly as warm as I anticipated.  I knew they wouldn't be wool socks or anything like that, but they're even thinner than my basic athletic socks. Disappointing but I still like the look of these boot socks."
4.0,"I did not realize that this belt would have a wide section in the back, but I can probably get away with just folding it down through the loops of my leather coat."
4.0,This would be a 5-star rating if the shipping method was better.<br /><br />When the Hat arrived it had very deep creases in it that could not be removed easily. Luckily it's a good quality hat with an agreeable material.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged from buying this hat just because of the creases.<br /><br />I used the linen setting on my steam iron to remove the creases over like 30-40 minutes and four attempts.<br /><br />It now looks exactly like the picture
4.0,"Husband wears a size 12 in men's shoes, the XLs were a little small on him. Other than that they worked great for his wrestler costume and were more affordable than boots."
4.0,Got these to use for my keys and other items they work good
4.0,Mom's funeral
4.0,"I love this keychain, but the whistle didn’t work. Overall I like it a lot"
4.0,Beautiful but much smaller than anticipated.
4.0,"Simply loved it. Not giving five stars as the internal fabric teared when I moved the first time. I blame this on my arms size, but I would have expected it wouldn't."
4.0,Loved it and the magnetic clasp is very secure.
4.0,They are ok.  I had to have them shortened and the fit ok other than being long.
4.0,"Warm, cozy and well fitting. I enjoy wearing this hat, and I'm not a great hat person! Try it for yourself!"
4.0,Good length. Pockets are great. Wide elastic is a little uncomfortable at natural waist. Would hav preferred waist to sit a little lower.
4.0,I really like this bikini. The bottoms are definitely pretty revealing and a little bit tight on my hips but overall it fits really well and the color is great. I would buy it again!
4.0,It is a lovely beret. The quality of the wool is good. I gave it to my beautiful daughter and it looks great on her. I wish it came in colors that look good with salt and pepper color hair.
4.0,It can't beat Lynco brandname but it is cheaper. If anyone needs more support I think Lynco brandname which is better.
4.0,It was a good product it just didn't fit
4.0,"I ordered these pants in several sizes. I’m normally a size 8, 5’10 & 150lbs.  I ordered based off the size chart available. I would say the size chart is wrong. The 8 was too tight and more like a 28” waist, the pant leg is more like 27” not 30”. It fit like a size 6.  I don’t mind the short leg as I plan to wear these for summer, but the waist size is way off. I reordered in a size 10 and hope they fit.<br />What I like: the fabric is lightweight and very soft & flowy. I didn’t find the color to be see through with nude undergarments. I like the dressy style for office setting. I’m hoping the larger size will work."
4.0,"Good construction but not for the purposes I need. Straps hard to adjust due to design, hard to make even and fit and stay on for things like sports (snowboarding)"
4.0,I like it just if u like a big hoodies on you then I recommend a bigger size but it’s supposed to be tight so you can see your face. But overall I recommend I liked it 100%
4.0,"Fits great on my petite 18 month old daughter. True to size. It works well as a warm jacket in 50-60 degree weather but I wouldn't use it as a winter coat. It feels cheap but soft, light and airy. My baby brings it to me and likes to wear it more than other jackets. It packs down well and works in the car seat fine (I don't use coats in the car seat but this is pretty thin). The flap material by the neck kind of tore off halfway and the buttons are cheap but it works. I like the elasticized hood and cuffs. My little girl looks adorable in it. I love the bear ears! I wouldn't pay more than $15 for it (I think I paid just under that). I included a photo of my baby wearing the size 12-18 months at 16 months old."
4.0,met my expectations.
4.0,There are a million compression socks out there and this is really no different than any of them.  They work effectively.  Biggest perk with this set is the green color which my daughter loves.
4.0,Not bad for the price. Falling apart after a month of seldom use
4.0,"Received this product quickly.  I love it!  Would have loved it more if it had brought more luck to my Bruins!  :)  Love the shirt, love the Bruins!  I recommend this product!"
4.0,Looks way better than expected
4.0,"This top is a true pink, which looks great. The fabric is a little stiff and feels more like linen then the cotton-poly blend that it is.  Still, I think it's going to work well in the hot climate I'm heading for."
4.0,Great little summer robe for the price
4.0,Great value and nice size.. Some socks are smaller.. These are nice size to fit a large foot.
4.0,Made in China don’t think it’s Authentic
4.0,Great colors and great price! Could be just a little longer!
4.0,"I ordered extra large and it is still too close, order a size up"
4.0,115 pounds. 5'4. Size M. Bottoms are too big so I also ordered a small. Def not high waisted.
4.0,"The watch fits perfect in my wrist, just classic enough for me."
4.0,"These lightweight socks are soft and comfortable. The fabric is thin, which works well for the hotter days."
4.0,It really does cover all bases.. you can wear it to the beach and then go straight to dinner. .. I'm not talking 5☆ ... but any mid range sit down restaurant it would absolutely pass.
4.0,"Nice watch but would say this is more for a 10 year old child and up as the face is large. I got it for my 8 year old and it is big for him, we will make it work as he really like it. I didn't get any instructions with it and will be following up to get some, but it wasn't very difficult to set the main aspects. I am having a hard time getting the instruction's would like to get the seller to please send them."
4.0,Not bad for the price i paid. Its cute
4.0,I just wished that they would not be visibly transparent through the water gels. They work great and they will be used a lot!
4.0,"This watch has its pros and cons which I will list below.<br /><br />+Nice size, Not some bulky monstrosity like so many watches today, doesn't crowd your wrist with a baseball sized gaudy trinket.<br />+Easy fast setup<br />+long battery life (allegedly, have not had for as many years as the claimed battery life)<br />+easy to switch between 12/24 hour setup (dedicated button actually)<br />+feels like a quality piece, the band doesn't feel cheap like it is going to snap in half (the buckle is a different story, I think it is plastic, it as not failed me but I question its long term durability)<br />+uncluttered display, not too much information being shown at once, just day, date, and time.<br />+Good waterproofing, easily survives taking daily showers, and the plastic band does not absorb moisture and shot never rot or mold.<br />lots of adjustment points, will fit a child's wrist as easily as a full grown mans.<br /><br />~neutral considerations~<br /><br />being made of rubber or plastic, the band will make you sweat against it, especially if it is humid like it has been around me lately.<br /><br />Negatives<br />-NOT made in the US, Made in Thailand according to the back of the watch.<br />- the lighting feature is cheesy, it only lights up one half of the watch (unless mine is broken) and it is almost unnoticeable unless you are in a very dark room, better hope you only need to know the hour and MAYBE the minutes, because the seconds are basically completely dark.<br /><br />for 11 dollars, why not, if you want or need a good budget watch that doesn't look awful, this very well may be the watch for you."
4.0,"Looked amazing and great quality, little small in the arms but great besides that."
4.0,"Super cute bag- was a little smaller in person than expected, but worth the money. Holds my essentials, including my wallet. A small wallet, but still does the job. Neutral color will go well with spring and summer outfits. Good alternative to the circle woven bags advertised everywhere- looks different but still cute."
4.0,Sooooo cute!!! They are heavier than expected though.
4.0,I love the shirt however there is a darker brown spot on shirt then the rest of the shirt. Paying$25 bucks for a shirt I'd think there would be nothing wrong with it so it gets four stars instead of five.
4.0,"First, I hope you find these pictures helpful because posting a picture of yourself in a swimsuit on a huge website like this is intimidating, but I figured if I'm wearing a bathing suit out publicly, people are going to see me anyway, and I do always find it much more helpful to see real bodies in clothes when I'm buying online.<br /><br />From the front, I think this bathing suit is as cute and flattering of a style as I can get in a bathing suit, as none are going to give me a supermodel body anyway.  I think it's really cute.  I found the neck a little tight if I want to hold ""the girls"" up at all, but not too uncomfortable to wear.  I do like that there is ""padding"" in the bra, but keep in mind that it is purely to help with nipple coverage and there is nothing here that will offer any lift or shape to help out us not-so-young women, especially post-children.  A little more help up top would help push this towards 5 stars.  The only other thing I wish were improved, though this is super common on pretty much all bathing suits, is that I think a cute or flattering style seems to only be thought of for your front, and when you turn around, while fully covering and holding you in, there is nothing to distract from every little lump or roll.  With the ""tummy control"" the suit is tight enough that it does help a bit in the back, but I'm not sure why companies can't come up with a cut, pattern, or style that offers the same flattering help in back as it does up front.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased and think this suit is well priced and will make me feel more confident to wear than most other suits.  The only one I have that I like better has a somewhat similar cut but a patterned fabric which I believe helps my back look more flattering than just a blob of one color."
4.0,"Cute top, but not light pink, more of a neon salmon"
4.0,"This dress is super cute! It fits very well and is nice and light. Since the dress has spaghetti straps that you can tie, you don’t have to worry about always adjusting the straps.  I wore it for my husband and he ❤️❤️❤️ it."
4.0,If you wear anything more than 2.75 forget these.<br />Well made and should last longer than most.
4.0,"This is a great suit! I (the wife) am 5'7 and wear a size 10/12. I ordered a 12 and it fit perfectly. The color/pattern was exactly as pictured. If you are big chested, you have to really tighten the straps for support, but that tends to be the case with any suit I find. The only reason why this was a 4 out of 5 star is only because of the shorts. In the picture, they seem like they are longer than what they actually are. I don't have big hips, and I still find them very short and easy to ride up which would not be comfortable at the beach."
4.0,The material is cheap and wrinkles really bad. It is also hard to style. It is just not my style but is super cute on others!
4.0,Straps are actually thicker than it looks in picture
4.0,"I ordered this buckle & was excited by the appearance & quality of the product. Unfortunately, the buckle was the wrong size for the belt I ordered it for, so I had to return it. The good news, however, is that the seller was so incredibly helpful & prompt with a response & refund. They were very friendly and I would definitely purchase from this seller in the future."
4.0,"Does the job well. Would be nice if the T part had a rubber/plastic coat like the clasp to lessen the potential for scratching, otherwise can’t ask for much more."
4.0,Quality fabric and appears to be well made. Very good value.
4.0,"I did not think the fabric was very soft, a bit cheesecloth feel.  One button came cracked so I had to replace all three to match.  I probably would have returned it, but since I was trying it for free I'll keep it."
4.0,Bigger then I thought but it's beautiful. And works well!
4.0,"I wore the colored ones for a few days with no problems, to the extent that they never came loose and I do play with them somewhat. I had to take them out though because the post backing is thicker than my metal ones and I couldn't get use to that. Also, my snake bites are less than a year old, and even though metal posts go in np, these bioplasty ones seemed a bit thicker and were very hard to get in, so I wouldn't recommend for someone who doesn't want to feel like their gauging their piercing trying to get it in."
4.0,"These came sealed in a large bubble envelope, separated by small plastic bags. I'd say the packing is pretty good as long as whoever handles it is gentle, and nothing is tossed on top of it.<br />The lapis and aventurine are the most flawless of the pack, they're also the most opaque.<br />The tiger eye appears like it was broken and glued together, hopefully it doesn't fall apart in the future.<br />Amethyst, quartz, and rose quartz are all very pretty but have minor chips, probably from when they were cut.<br />The pendant frame feels very sturdy, and unlikely to ever break or bend, but I'm not going to test it.<br /><br />Overall if rocks and minerals are up your alley, this would make a perfect gift for yourself or a friend.<br />Also, the &#34;green adventure&#34; is more commonly known as aventurine, seller must not be aware."
4.0,Very fall festive! Nice quality. Love the silver and gold maple leaves. One pair is a little heavy.
4.0,My hip area measures around 32 inches. I typically wear a medium but I bought an extra-large. They are a little tighter than I thought they would be.
4.0,"Bought them for my daughter , Really nice shoe but larger fit so need to let them back for a year"
4.0,"My husband usually wears a medium in shirts, but I bought this in a size large and it fits him perfectly. Somewhat cheaply-made, I don't think this is a shirt that will last more than a couple of years, but still, cute."
4.0,It's an apron... it seems to be made of good quality materials and the pockets are attached well. I would have liked the waist ties to be longer so it could be tied in front rather than behind. I don't seem to be very good at tying a bow behind me... I added small line to the existing ties so I can tie in front. But that is just my preference. It will keep me &#34;cleaner&#34;.
4.0,"Replacement was easy, packaging was great for the product everything needed was included."
4.0,Very comfortable and they stay up on the leg. Use them primarily for running. Some other compression socks made specifically for running seem to have just a little too much compression for me. These provide a good amount of compression without feeling overly tight. While I like the solid black an assortment of colors and designs would be nice. And if you notice in the pics I have them rolled over just a little at the top. Still really comfortable but I’m 5’8 so they are just a smidge long without rolling them down.
4.0,Received the T-shirt quickly & looks like good quality. Giving it as a holiday gift so hopefully it fits.
4.0,These are great. I jus hate to keep taking them off when I'm changing pens
4.0,"I really like the looks and feel of this watch, however, the links were very difficult to take out.  Even with using the tool, the tool broke.  Also, it is a bit large for a women's watch, but I will still wear it.  Seems like its a quality product."
4.0,"Very comfortable. The elastic waistline is poorly stitched. You get what you paid for,  I have purchased 2. If you wanted you could size down.<br />The only difference in the picture is that it is boot cut not wide bell and there is no white line in the inner leg area only on the outside."
4.0,It's good quality but it's not made for someone with a lot of cards (usually moms have a lot)
4.0,"Love the shirt, ordered a 2t received 18months"
4.0,Nice comfortable fit.. great for the gym or just relaxing.
4.0,"While the quality of the necklace is somewhat low, it seems sturdy enough and came with very cute card and envelope packaging. Appropriate value for money. The recipient adored it!"
4.0,"I love my bag. It carries what I bought it for, though I do wish it was an inch to two inches bigger."
4.0,"bought for the Wifey,  she's 5'4&#34; 135lbs Medium fit perfect, good material."
4.0,"Super cute and the color is fabulous, full, rich red. It was just too big for one and two, it didn't come off the shoulder as pictured, then three, it was too long so I would have to wear heels. And I purchased a large and had plenty room so it's a perfect, casual yet sexy number for the right person."
4.0,Use size M .I'm perfect! Is of very good quality. I am very pleased. Very good product
4.0,This is beautifully made ring but it didn't have a lot of gold specs in it so it made me a little curious as if it was not real or not cuz that was supposedly does have gold flake in it but my daughter loves it
4.0,"The product came from overseas so shipping took a while but that is expected. The shirt came packaged in a nice zipper type bag. The shirt label says it is Gildan company and made with premium cotton and that they are preshrunk. The shirts have a rubbery/stretch type feel to them but they are still comfortable! The picture seems a lit bigger in the picture than it does on the shirt, in fact I was disappointed by how small it was actually as it fill the entire chest area and on the actual shirt it is just a small center area of the shirt. So overall it was a good shirt, just wish the picture was proportional to the selling picture image.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount rate in exchange for an HONEST review of the product. However, the price at which I received the product has nothing to do with my review, I try to be as honest as possible in my reviews so that other customers can know exactly what they are buying.<br /><br />Please feel free to ask any questions you may have, I try to make my reviews as honest and thorough as possible, so that another person can know exactly what they would get. If my review was helped you at all in your  considering this product please hit the yes button below!"
4.0,"Well made and reasonably comfortable, but it must be filtering well because it’s rather hard to breathe through"
4.0,"Lovely Bralette, but not substantial enough to support my 32DD size."
4.0,Very nice dress but unfortunately it was to small for me.
4.0,"Good product, well made.  Fast delivery."
4.0,Love the reflector strips!  Wish it was longer though.
4.0,"Great buy!  very good construction, however it is smaller than I expected so you need to order one size larger or maybe even 2 sizes larger, especially for the band size. Very supportive at the band area, really lifts!"
4.0,GOld is different from the photo.
4.0,"So cute and comfy. But it runs large. I usually wear a L-XL, but the large fit like a XXL. I reordered for a smaller size. Hoping to have more success with the medium."
4.0,Easy to loose
4.0,Quality is v. Good. The socks look very stylish.
4.0,I like the fabric but it falls off their ears too easy.
4.0,"Bought this in Lugano a Swiss town near the Italian border two years ago at a small watch shop.  Never heard of Hanowa until then, but the shop owner convinced me.  He was right, it is a quality watch and I've enjoyed it."
4.0,"It is very nice ,  kinda darker  than the picture but  I recommend it. Good quality."
4.0,Good socks :)
4.0,"I ordered the rust size 20. I'm short and have a bigger mid section. I love the color. Length was actually good too.  I do like how it laces up the back that way can be comfortable, can go looser or tighter. I wish it was a little higher in the back to cover bra. It's just a little to low and shows bra strap. I like how liner is sewn in so stays put. I'm needing to figure out how to alter the top so I can keep it. I'm using this for bridesmaid dress in Nov. Im Needing suggestions on alterations for shoulder area, bust area."
4.0,I really like this shirt.  It's very soft but it does run a little large.  I normally wear a medium and it was quite big and I would probably size down when ordering.
4.0,Color is lighter than shown in the photo. (More of a lighter tan/ offish white) Stitching was nice. It's rather soft and warm. I'm wearing this right now. ;)
4.0,"I really like the band - it is wide (not like blood pressure cuff wide, but wider for sure than the standard Luminox band). I like the look. I wish that the non prickly part of the hook and loop (Velcro) was a tighter weave because I worry about what it look like (e.g. fuzzy and uneven) over time. Been weeks now and still looks good, however."
4.0,Perfect size to take in to arenas or stadiums that have the clear bag policy. Like the zip on top to keep everything inside. Would have given it 5 stars if the outside pocket had a zipper closure also. Works great and sturdy plastic bag & handles.
4.0,"Blouse made well for the price, nice and flowy. I order an XL"
4.0,I love these pins! The only drawback is the rubber backings rather than the metal. One has come off already but got a metal one to replace it.
4.0,Washed it and there were strings everywhere. Didn't like the way it was hemmed. A hem should be blind stiched.
4.0,Great fit and color. Starting to fray at neck seam after 3 washes
4.0,Nice going to enjoy it with the cooler weather
4.0,"Really nice shirt, but with weird fiting. You has to be very small in the chest area to have a perfect fit of this item."
4.0,"Good fit, nice summer-y pants.  They do make a little noise when you walk but not that bad considering the price."
4.0,Very thin. Doesn’t hold much more than a phone.
4.0,It's a little big don't get me wrong but it's not hard to put in and it looks nice so I don't see anything bad about it
4.0,I am 5’ tall and 108lbs usually wear xsmall but it was very small I re ordered one size up.
4.0,I like how the wallet holds cards perpendicular rather than parallel so<br />They don’t fall out.  The stitching could use a more robust thread but other than that I love it.
4.0,"I was skeptical this would fit me, as the XXL reported fits 7 3/4 to 7 7/8. And for me, I always need at least a size 8 hat. However, this hat fit & with a little room to spare; call it closer to 8 1/8. So it pretty clearly runs large, which is not quite so clear from reading the sizing chart at the top of the page. Otherwise, it's a nice quality hat for the money & was comfortable. Fine for eggiwegging & drencromming with your droogs, as me dedoochka used to say."
4.0,"Happy with the product. Fits well, comfy, just the desired light weight."
4.0,"Pretty nice quality and work, but it doesn't look like its advertised size - looks visually smaller."
4.0,"Bought these for my husband to wear with a Simpson’s shirt. He typically wears an XL, so that’s what I bought. Unfortunately they’re super small, and fit like leggings. He says they’re comfortable though, so I won’t be returning them. If I bought him another pair, I’d try to find a 3x because these fit like a medium."
4.0,Cool watch. Gave as a Christmas gift and it was a hit.
4.0,"It is a very nice casual purse, well made and comfortable"
4.0,"Like other reviewers have said, to get the look pictured you should probably order a size or two up. I wanted a loose tunic, and went up two sizes. I'm happy that I did. The arm holes are not as open as the picture indicates - they're round and a bit small. This is another reason to size up. Good quality. Not smelly. All in all, it's a comfortable and cute/subtly sexy top. It goes well with my mermaid leggings. :)"
4.0,"Cheaply made but still perfect.  I got this as a corny anniversary present for my dude and it took a couple tries to get the picture the right size for it.  It's not like real metal.  I think it has some other materials included in it so when it hits stuff or you're just swinging it you can hear this weird noise with it.  Honestly, I like it and it's not like I'm wearing the locket around my neck or anything it's hanging up with my other one.  It's good and came in beautiful colors."
4.0,"For the price I can't complain. They were easy to tie on and never broke. However, after 3 weeks the colors started fading. Alot of the beads turned white. So I ended up cutting them off."
4.0,"Very beautiful, got a lot of compliments for it. Good quality material and embroydery."
4.0,This sweater got 4 stars because I get compliments on it.  It is definitely warm.  The pockets are not real.  I like the casual look of it.  Also sweaters can run $100 plus so the price was sort of reasonable.
4.0,Not sure what size every e else ordered but I'm normally m/l and ordered 2x due to reviews. ...big mistake. .it is HUGE. Should've stuck with large
4.0,It was perfect for the use
4.0,Gives my watch a trendy look. Easy to replace my old watch band.
4.0,"Pros:<br />App is simple to use<br />Battery already installed<br />Extra battery included in box<br />Manual in English<br />Expandable band fits perfectly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Requires email to use app<br />Replacing battery requires removing tiny screws<br />Tiny phillips screw driver not incuded<br />Plastic body<br /><br />I must admit, when I first unboxed this watch I was kind of disappointed. The watch felt lightweight and cheap, almost like a toy. When I installed the app, it required me to enter my email before the app would run. I'm always wary, because some companies will sell your personal info to make money. I'm not saying this company will do it, but I recommend getting a temporary email just in case. Searching google will show you some free, temporary email websites. After it accepted the email, everything worked great. The app was easy to use, and the watch set itself. It took about 30 minutes for the time to move ahead 10 hours. The app only needs permission to use your location and bluetooth.<br />After wearing the watch, I appreciate the light weight. The main body and rear cover is made of plastic. At first, I was disappointed, but I guess plastic is better for radio reception. The face cover is made of glass. I just need to be careful not to scratch the plastic. I ordered the one with the expandable metal band. It's easy to slip on and off. I think it's made of aluminum, so it should be fairly durable. My wrist is about 6.75 inches, and this fits perfectly. If you have very thick wrists, you might want to get the buckle type band.<br />I opened the back to see how easy it is to change the battery. If you have poor eyesight, you are going to have a difficult time, because the screws are tiny. There are open holes on the back for the speaker, so I doubt it's waterproof.<br />Pressing the top button will speak the time. The female voice is loud and clear. Pressing the bottom button will start bluetooth. Pressing it again will speak the alarm setting. You can set up to 5 different alarms using the app. You can also set the watch to chime.<br />As I mentioned before, I wasn't impressed when I first saw the watch, but I like it now. The watch face is attractive, and looks like a Timex. Also, it's lightweight and comfortable, which makes me forget I'm wearing a watch. The only issue is durability. Since it's just a casual, everyday watch, I can live with a few scuffs and scratches.<br />Update: I was expecting this watch to synchronize with the radio signal from the atomic clock, but it does not. It can only update the time via the app at midnight. So, you must keep the app running in the background, bluetooth turned on, and the watch must be placed near the watch. Therefore, this is not really an atomic watch as I see it. Also, I noticed that the watch is off by 1 second every day. So, after a week it's off by about 7 seconds compared to the US atomic clock."
4.0,beautiful.  There were a little smaller then I thought.
4.0,Very cute shirt.  Washes well.  My 12 year old daughter loves it and wears it often.
4.0,Very nice and on time.
4.0,"I love the look and fit of this shirt, except that it is REALLY SHORT on me.  I am tall (5'10&#34;) but I didn't think it would fit me like a crop top.  I have to wear it with high-waist yoga pants, but it still looks super cute and shows off my cute sports bras, which is what I bought it for."
4.0,Bought this for work. Stays bunches up in my bag most of the time but works well when I’ve used it. South Florida rain so it comes in buckets. All of me inside the poncho stays nice and dry. Only problem is being 5’10’ the poncho ends just mid shin and my pants get soaked with all the run off below that. But again I it keeps the majority of me very dry for our deluges.
4.0,"i was so excited to recieve this brooch as i bought it to spice up a very boring black camera bag. it is gorgeous and unique looking. however, the inside part with the lady was a little smaller than the metal part it was to go in to. but other than that it is to die for!"
4.0,Order a size smaller made to fit over gear. Awesome jacket glad I didn't spend $450 on a brand name gore tex.
4.0,It is a value for the money paid.
4.0,"I found these jeans look and feel good when I put them on. They do have a stretch to them, maybe more than I am used to. The length comes down to below my ankles and I am ok with that. The color is a light blue, somewhat faded look. In general I like them and will continue to wear them."
4.0,Had to pay shipping so the price bumped up. But good clip.
4.0,"Cute dress. Material was different than expected...almost like a mix between a t shirt and a thin sweater. It breathes well and doesn’t keep the heat in which is nice. It does ride up a bit with the belt which puckers at the hip sometimes but as long as you’re conscious of it, it won’t cause a huge problem."
4.0,"Was curious to see how these work.  On the first day, we both noticed some itch feeling under the ring.  Spouse took it off, I switched fingers.  It's a thick ring so it took a couple days to get used to wearing it.  It's been about 5 days now and it hasn't broken.  It's a pretty ring.  Does it absorb negative energy?  Nobody will be able to tell.  If anything, it will make good conversation."
4.0,The lenses are big so they provide a lot of protection.  They feel lightweight and slightly cheap though.
4.0,For the price that I got it at it's worth it. I may never wear it but it is cute.
4.0,Not knowing how tight this was going to fit I ordered the 14 and it was way too big for me.  I'm a ten but can wear suits that are a size 12 or 14 since they usually are so tight.
4.0,"These are great light weight continuous circle headband /bandanas. The colors are vibrant (a little different than pictured but still good. I can use these folded as a band, long to cover my entire head. They wrap around my wrist or pull down over my neck or up to cover my face. They keep my hair back without slipping very much and keep sweat from running down my face. I can wet these to help cool me too. The only reason 4 stars is given is because the ends are not finished although they are clean cut and haven't frayed yet. The price and variety are great though and these is one to match any outfit. Well worth the price."
4.0,"The shirt is off-white rather than a true white color. Personally, it's too long for me even with a small, but it is cute, versatile, and layers well. The way the different materials are layered on the shirt is interesting. It's nothing bad but something to note before purchasing (see pictures)."
4.0,"My son saved up his allowance money to buy these, and he's completely satisfied. He receives compliments wherever he goes when he's wearing them. My only complaint is regarding the connectors used to recharge the lights. One seems to have been squished a little, so it's hard to connect the cable. I am really happy though that they're rechargeable, and you don't have to replace batteries."
4.0,"Love the cardigan, very cute. Sheds A LOT, so beware if you wear a dark tank or tee underneath. Carry a lint roller!"
4.0,I'm 18 and I absolutely love this beanie. The stitching could be a little better but you don't notice unless you're close up. Shipping came in a week! Fast compared to the estimated time.
4.0,"Took off one star because they are slightly large — both too long and too wide. They are super comfortable, though, and are great for spin class. Would recommend."
4.0,Great gloves and only reason I am leaving 4-stars is that the 2 pairs I ordered where different color and listed and pictured in the description which is mainly why I elected in buying these.  But they still do the job and I am not wearing them for a fashion show.
4.0,"I like the color and design, very beautiful dress but too small. The material is not the high quality though"
4.0,The shoes fit perfectly and looked amazing!
4.0,This thing must run small. I love the material though. Keeping for my kid
4.0,"I ordered these not having very high hopes for them, but turned out to be pleasantly surprised by the quality. They've held up in the wash (gentle) and in the dryer (low), and the colors are pretty funky. The fit is pretty good, if not a tad large, but that's ok, in case of shrinkage. I would definitely recommend."
4.0,"I have purchased other SYROKAN  sport bra in the past, however; this one was a different style than the ones I have purchased in the past. I like that it fits me well and give me the support that I need. Although since I am rather small chested, I don’t need that much support. I gave it a 4 stars because I find that it is very difficult getting in and out of it."
4.0,"Well made, lined, lovely design, beautiful wine color. I ordered large, up one size from my usual medium, and it's still just a bit small so that I will wear open instead of hooking it closed. Sleeves are quite long on me and will have to have them shortened, but that's the norm for me with long sleeved jackets/tops - I have short arms. In spite of minor and expected fit issues, this is a keeper, versatile with slacks, skirts and sleeveless dresses."
4.0,"Very comfortable dress, or beach cover."
4.0,If you're not a smaller or medium person these will fit VERY very tightly. Beware.
4.0,A gift for one of my sons who is short and plump.  It fit great and he loves it
4.0,Seem smaller and thinner then my last pack but still better the other brands
4.0,Loved the shirt. Just a little short for me. I have a long torso. Need to get to the gym so I can show my midriff again
4.0,Great authentic product. I only wish it were smaller.
4.0,"They fit my face very well, look good and feel good. Frame feels a bit cheap but they are cheap glasses."
4.0,"I am 5'2"" and 161 pounds but not hips at all so the fit was a little looser than I would have liked. I like the material as it is soft, and the print on the material gives it a real cute look. I would definitely recommend the seller and the product as well."
4.0,"I get grumpy when my glasses slide down or I have no good place to put them when I need to remove them for a short time.  These work just fine.  If you have a thicker neck, extending out the slightly elastic band the glasses ""ride"" just at the throat.  Some folks may want a longer strap.  I'd like one but this will work.  The material of the elastic strap is quite thin so it's comfortable, but there's no telling how durable it will be over time."
4.0,Great bag!  Sometimes struggle with straps staying on my shoulders but love it otherwise!
4.0,"I am using these in my COLD office and they are perfect for typing, writing, etc..."
4.0,"I literally had to cut a foot off the bottom and hem it up, but the dress fits nicely. Not true white, it has a slight purple tinge."
4.0,"I like the material since silicone gives me a rash but twice the metal piece broke off, once at a connector so I had to get a whole new band and the other was just the decorative edge but still. Needs slightly better construction but otherwise I like it"
4.0,"Overall, this is a pretty good product and feels really comfortable to wear around the house and when I'm out running (currently avoiding the gym during COVID).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- good feel<br />- cell phone pocket on the right leg of the attached compression shorts are a nice touch<br />- shorts are stretchy and helps me feel athletic while moving around<br /><br />Cons:<br />- shorts seem to run a bit small from my idea of the sizing chart.<br />  - So probably best to buy a size up from whatever you normally wear<br />- long-term durability may be an issue, given that after one wash my compression attachment has started to separate from the shorts itself near the waistband.<br />- the cell phone pocket on the compression shorts should be fine for lifting exercises, but anything involving cardio or higher intensity, you should avoid leaving phone in there."
4.0,Worked for a Woodstock party however the frame is silver not gold like pictured.
4.0,Top is great! Bottoms are a pretty small but wearable. Great value.
4.0,"I want to counter some of the bad reviews for this product.  First off yes it takes ages to get here, but come on guys it's coming from China...they are pretty far away so their delivery times can't be helped and should not be a reflection on the products.  With that being said, I have very small hands for an adult, as in my 10 year old nephew's hands are bigger, so these fit me just fine.  So if you are an adult with large or even averaged sized hands, they may not be very comfortable for you.  The gloves themselves are beyond cute, and they are really fury and soft.  Also the pads are sewn on quite nicely, they keep my hands warm and my fingers free, so they do their job well.  I deducted one star because they are cut weird.  Most gloves will have a &#34;sloping&#34; cut to them meaning the pinky finger is cut shorter, but with these they are all cut the same so my pinky finger doesn't really come through the glove at all.  With that being said that is the only thing or issue and even that isn't really an issue, it just looks funny."
4.0,Met expectations for quality and fit. Not 5 stars only because pockets are very small.
4.0,I love the look! It's adjustable so thats awesome but I can't wear it for more than an hour without it starting to hurt. Not sure if that's just me but I wish I could wear it for longer periods of time
4.0,"good sunglasses. good lines, look very nice and a quality case."
4.0,Look more expensive than they are and her friends all asked her about them.  Not a bad investment for cheaper jewelry.
4.0,It is very soft.
4.0,"Cute and comfortable. Like the fabric, but not in love with the lace."
4.0,"Beautiful and lovely dress. Material is ok, not very good quality. Good for summer and spring parties."
4.0,My daughter loved this costume for Halloween and received many compliments.  It was quite long so we had to pin up the legs to fit her but it was the perfect addition to her Disco Girl theme!
4.0,I like this a lot. I'm 5 ft 1in. and it didn't look too big on me. I will say it isn't made out of the best quality of fabric so don't wear a small backpack with it like I did. There is some wear on the back where my water pack rubbed on it.
4.0,"This watch is GREAT; however, the second hand broke off 4 months after purchase and is floating around in the face of the watch."
4.0,"Alright so this dress is sooo pretty. It's thick, nice stretchy material and it looks exactly in person like it does on the model. The colors and print are great. However. The neckline is so so so so low. I mean, I can tell that from the photo so I don't know why I wasn't expecting it, but it almost goes down to my bellybutton. You really must have a large bust area to pull this one off, I sure can't. It will really look beautiful on the right body type."
4.0,"Unfortunately, the socks run small.  They do not stretch enough.  My dad has narrow feet and they were still a bit tight."
4.0,"These are so cute! The colors are bright and vibrant. The leggings have great compression too. The only thing that I didn't care for was that I wish they were more high waisted and tighter in that area. If I was being very active it felt like the waist kept rolling down. Other than that, they're a keeper!"
4.0,"I purchased this for my husband as part of a costume.  We needed ankle length and he's 6'2&#34; with a 33&#34; waist. This for him perfectly and will work well for the finished piece. My only complaint is that the dress isn't as vibrant a purple as pictured. The photo suggests a color closer to fuchsia while the skirt in person is a cooler shade and darker.  Otherwise, a very nice and weighty chiffon."
4.0,"As far as I can tell these work just as good as more expensive shoes and pedals. However, I lost a screw on the second ride with them."
4.0,The pattern and fabric are great.  I feel it fits a bit snug and I'm more comfortable in a looser fit.
4.0,my grand daughter love the dress
4.0,"this is thinner than most hoodies, but that was what i was looking for. it will be a great fall/spring hoodie that i can wear with shorts and be just perfect. seems to be made of same quality as other hoodies. hood is pretty large and fits loosely just like i like it. very satisfied, great for the price."
4.0,This sweater was a pleasant surprise! I figured the price was too good for it to be nice but I was wrong! I got a medium and the sleeves are slightly tight and it would probably look too small if I tried to button it BUT I dont intend to wear it buttoned and it’s a nice fabric that I believe will stretch a little after wearing... so I’m not worried about the arms. I think a large would look too long so I’m happy with this!
4.0,"Fabric has some stretch to it and it's a great length but it rides up due to a slightly weird cut. I still really like it. Btw, I'm 200 lbs and I got the biggest size available and it fits perfectly. I'm a 14 in US stuff and got the XXXL."
4.0,Fits very good!
4.0,"Perfect top for fall. The sweater is light weight but still warm. The only issues I've had are that it holds a lot of static and it seems to collect hair everywhere we go, but it's super comfortable and is a nice addition to my closet. Fits pretty true to size. I have a large bust and typically go between a L and XL. Purchased the L and am happy I did- fits great."
4.0,My adorable granddaughter looks amazing in this.
4.0,Comfortable true to size.
4.0,quality held up
4.0,"Awesome hat.  It never even occurred to me that I would need anything other than &#34;large&#34; for my boyfriend's big head, but he has asked me to order him another in medium for a more snug fit.  I can see that the large is a bit big on him, but it still works and looks fine."
4.0,Nice tiles but did have a few that were cracked.
4.0,"He really liked it, but the spinners clogged up and it doesnt spin so nicely anymore. it was a good, comfortable fit though."
4.0,Beautiful costume jewelry. It has a lot of intricate detail and really sparkles. The only small draw back is that you may have to carefully stretch it.<br />I have very small wrists and it was a little tight.
4.0,"Beautiful dress. It didn't work for my body type. I'm 5'3 160 lbs. I purchased a large as I usually wear, but it was too loose"
4.0,Nice bracelet only thing is stones are not red
4.0,"Size was accurate and the jacket fits well, the zipper is a little difficult to pull up but all in all a good product."
4.0,I have issues with sunglasses being too tight on my temples. These are actually very comfortable. Lightweight and cute. I am also very rough on sunglasses and so far I have not had any issues with bent arms. Have had them for about two weeks now.
4.0,"I was hesitant to make a statement in this suit and go out of my comfort zone, but so glad I did.  I received a ton of compliments and was entirely comfortable in this swimsuit!"
4.0,No issues.  They are what they are described as.
4.0,Good 👌
4.0,"looks like a good product but I thought I ordered 5, now I see  there were two choices, want to return this and order the 5 pack. maybe it's just me but I found the language a little confusing & easy to make a mistake. Also trying to return it the site malfunctioned so i'll try again."
4.0,Nice quality but runs small.
4.0,Kind of lags. Needs to be readjusted every few days. Great for hands-free usage. Bought it for mom and girlfriend.
4.0,"I was  received the watch, I have to say the  build quality is pretty good clean lines what was shown on the picture is pretty accurate, The only thing  that I didn't like was the manual that came with it it really did not explain to much of the functionality of the watch but other than that I'm pretty satisfied with it I like it ."
4.0,Surprisingly nice looking watch for the price. It adjusts easily.
4.0,The sleeves are too long for me but i ecpected this because i have short arms and i am 140lb i am 5'3 and i git the medium. It fits as i expected it too i am happy with it but its also itchy when i wear it on my arms
4.0,"Love the color.  Love the pattern.  Arrived quickly.  As usual with these dresses, they are a little &#34;high waisted.&#34;"
4.0,"Great fit, my daughter is 4 and loves lol. They are soft and she loves them."
4.0,Like it very much & I use it on alternate days with my other watch.
4.0,"For me the vest fit me a little bit tight,I got size medium is my size ,it’s not too tight but I hope it look a little bit more loose.."
4.0,"After reading comments, I ordered a size larger and am happy with the fit. These are well made and comfortable. Will probably order another pair."
4.0,"Loose fit, very comfy"
4.0,Dress fits great! The only problem is it is slightly too long. I need to wear heels to not step on it.
4.0,"These are well designed. I got the choco+mint stretching kitty. I unscrewed the keychain screw, so I could rest it on a flat surface. Kittah & donut sit upright perfectly. Cheers! :3 :3"
4.0,Love the bracelet just can't put on. The material is stiff and next to impossible to hold together and work clasp. Needs  to be stretchy to get on.
4.0,Super fun for Christmas party.  My ONLY complaint was the dress is a bit long but since I was wearing it to my sons school party it was great. I got so many compliments and for the price it can’t be beat!
4.0,This looks adorable on my teenage daughter. It's soft cotton fabric and the colors are vibrant. Just what she needed for her birthday
4.0,Comfortable fit. If you are a medium or large in other clothing it's best to order this dress one size up
4.0,"cheap fabric, nice casual summer dress"
4.0,Super cute light stretchy material but definitely more purple than pink
4.0,They are a little big but maybe I just have a boney neck! lol
4.0,Great straps. Only problem I had was I ordered 22mm 7 of the 8 Straps were 22mm one is 20mm.  Thankfully it wasn't one of the ones I wanted Specifically.
4.0,Good coat for the price. Nothing of high quality fabric. But nicely made and very cute on. Just needed it for a quick trip to Ohio and for the price it was good enough.
4.0,"I’m 5’5, 130lbs. Very slim. I ordered a medium and it was still small on me. It’s very soft and comfy and good quality. Order two sizes up."
4.0,"If I had not just recently bought the best slim front pocket wallet, I would have given this one 5 stars. But after a lifetime of trying different wallets in my front pockets, only one gets 5 stars and this is the only one that gets 4 stars. Soft and supple...maybe a bit too unstructured. Love the pull tab to get the cards to stick out. Could use at least one outer pocket for quick access."
4.0,"Gives hour glass figure look, I did not care for the pointy gold 80s punk stubs on the sleeves, (easily took them off with a small nail cutter or scissor) I took them all off the cuffs and it looked so much better, Use it with very high heels or it will drag big time. Im 5'4 155 curvy hips, 34b/c cup. Wrinkle free and good material. good buy for the money. silky sleeves, V neck can be closed up more or widen up for a sexy push up bra. Use a full black panty to give a rounder bum look. highly recommend it! great suit for the money!"
4.0,"these are pretty earrings, especially with the carnelian insert.  however, i was a bit dismayed to find the carnelian to be so small. i expected a larger insert.  i enjoy wearing them"
4.0,"Returned too short, but a very nice dress, would be comfy. Sleeves are nice coverage with out constricting. It's important to note I'm 5'2&#34; and it's short in me comes about 3&#34; above the knee. Depends on your comfort level."
4.0,"Bought to wear for a Mean Girls theme party but it’s giving Clueless fr. I personally would wear tweed for a Clueless look tbh. But this is still cute, especially for the cost.  Otherwise no complaints from me. I too got quite a few compliments on the outfit. Lol I’d probably order another in a different color."
4.0,"My wife absolutely loves these, but the logo fell off one side after a couple days."
4.0,"These are very good quality for the price, sturdy and comfortable and VERY portable, easily fitting into the pen-pocket of my purse. The only reason they get four instead of five stars is that the package was mis-labeled; I ordered silver, they sent a package marked 'silver' but the glasses and case are the dark gunmetal-gray. I'm keeping them anyway because I don't care that much about the color, and I'm otherwise pleased."
4.0,Wish I'd ordered a larger size cuz this one is a but small. . . My fault!
4.0,Bought these for a neon-themed party and they fit right in.  Chunky medium-large size earrings. Plastic /lightweight.
4.0,I gave this to my granddaughter.  The only way to see the initial and year is to look up close. Very cute earrings. Just really small.
4.0,"I got an extra large cuz I wasn't sure if it was in asian sizes or not, it's definitely not asian size.  I can alter it to fit, so it's not the end of the world."
4.0,Like the necklace no so much the earrings.
4.0,"WetSox makes a quality product. Unfortunately, the sizing is not right for my body type. I wear a large short wetsuit and the med was too tight on my arms, chest, shoulders and the large was tight and too long. I’m 5’7” athletic muscular build."
4.0,Really cute and fun shoe!!!
4.0,"I loved it but the string just hung down, not sure if it was suppose to be like dat but it was. And by the end of the night my strap snap a lil"
4.0,item received as expected
4.0,"Haven't worn it yet, but seems to be well made"
4.0,Me quedo bien un poco largo pero mi altura es muy baja
4.0,Overall these are great. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was I expected them to be a thicker material. But they fit great and are very comfortable. I’m 5’4 210 lbs. wider hips and ordered an XL. They fit perfectly
4.0,"The band was very nice when I received it, and I really like the band as well. Unfortunately after about 6 months, one of the retaining straps fell off. The lining also started to fall apart, though that may be due to a new cologne. It still looks great on the watch though, and the short size fits perfectly for me."
4.0,"They look great and they where definitely affordable, but they are NOT for constant wear. Will irritate your ears if worn longer than work shifts or such."
4.0,"Beautiful bag, Very cool story about the recycled seatbealts used to make these? Brilliant! The color is more Light blue than even close to Turquoise (which was my search but I'm sure for the money (very little and the bags finished beautifully, I'll be able to find a scarf to tie! Almost PERFECT! The colorr is really a light blue. (Don't be confused by &#34;Robins Egg Turquoise &#34; & the photo is a bit dark), otherwise a great piece! Gorgeous!"
4.0,I loved the color and matched my dress perfectly. I wishe the stone on the ring had a deep green as it is on the necklace.
4.0,"The fit is as expected, slightly large but it is expected for winter outerwear to waer with layers. It's  a thick, warm wool material and loos great, especially for the price.<br /><br />Con: An important con is the belt, the metal eyelets are rough and uneven and can easily cut the skin."
4.0,Super chic.
4.0,"While the item is a big larger than I expected, I love it! It is so comfortable and cute! The color is as depicted, as was the cut of my dress. I might order every color..."
4.0,"I love this necklace with the birthday gems and heart charm.  I can switch out different gems to match my outfit, but my favorite is too put all the gems in at once.  It is so beautiful and colorful that way !"
4.0,Cute. Light weight. It shrunk a little. Ordering another in a larger size.
4.0,The skirt is super cute however the top is super cheap. I might even use one I already have and just toss this one.
4.0,"Can’t say much because I had to return mine due to size , I ordered a small , because I’m 5’7 ... & it felt like I had a sports bra on !"
4.0,it is a great purse & roomy just wish it wasn't sooo shiny looking but it is nice
4.0,"I cannot say that this watch band is completely awesome. It's good 4 stars, good for mid size watches. Average price which is 60-80$. I installed it on my Russian made Vostok watch. Acceptable and worth the price."
4.0,Fits as expected. I've gotten lots of compliments on it.
4.0,a little small. cute
4.0,I really loved the flow of this dress. The top bust was a little too tight for me and the dress is see through and too long for me. Beautiful dress but didnt fit right in me.
4.0,"great quality, shipping was a little slower than projected but I wasn't in a hurry"
4.0,I love it..would buy again
4.0,"Fits well, not crazy about it."
4.0,"This is great for me, with the amount of cards I have, it gets the job done...<br />It's very neat and slim...<br />Can't hold a bulky amount of money, but then again it's really a card holder, so it's perfect when u just want to do a little light shopping without having to carry around your hand bag...<br />It's quite convenient for me.<br />The color is PERFECT and very pretty...just like the description says.<br />It's a great buy and i'll advice anyone to get it once they're interested."
4.0,"Just so we are clear. I don't give anything a five because nothing is perfect. I would give this a 4.5 though because it seems to be well thought out and a better than average belt. Love the adjustment, smooth and easy. As with anything only time will tell."
4.0,I bought this dress for a birthday party. I was 34 weeks pregnant with my fourth child and ordered a small (I want to wear post-baby). The fit was snug across the mid-section (to be expected) hut incredibly comfortable. I never once felt the need to adjust it. Wish I had taken a photo to post.
4.0,"These are some of the best sunglasses I've owned. They fit well to my face and the polarized lenses make driving very comfortable.<br />The selling point was that they float, which they do, but the colours they come in will not be easily seen in the water. I am now on my fourth pair of these glasses having broken one pair and lost two pairs to Poseidon whilst kiteboarding. Once they are away from you in the water, you have no chance of spotting them.<br />Great product though, hence me repeatedly going back."
4.0,Way to thin. Only lasted a 3x wearing them
4.0,They are breathable.
4.0,a little more cropped than i had hoped so size up if that’s an issue
4.0,"Very comfortable right out of the box thanks to the low-density foam in the sole.  Unfortunately, the trade off is durability.  Obviously anything this soft is not going to last long and that is the case here - thankfully they are fairly cheap as I have only gotten one summer out of each pair I have bought as opposed to a normal reef pair which would last 3-5 years in most cases."
4.0,Just what I was looking for.Fit great.Thank you so much.
4.0,Love this sweater it's soft and warm! Iam usually a small I ordered a medium and it fits good Iam only 5 ft 1 so it is a longer sweater I'll wear with leggings.
4.0,"Runs a little small... I wish there was a xxxl I. The one I purchased but the xxl will do, just can’t button it.  Decent quality for the price."
4.0,The dot's leave indentations on my legs.
4.0,I thought that the material was perfect for the warm climate of SW Florida. Easily can be dressed up with jewelry. I am buying a couple more before they sell out.
4.0,"very cute! Took some work to get them to stay on,  but i think I got it. You have to put them on like regular earrings and squeeze the post once there are in the right position. This is my first time with this kind of earring, so maybe that's not a secret. They are light as a feather. Delivered early and in a cute package. Good seller, will buy from again. Good price for my first pair of ear crawlers!"
4.0,It's of good quality exactly as per description. . And so it's very big for my taste.. check the pics for size before order it .
4.0,"The dress is beautiful, but it was not for me. I am normally a size 4 or 6, so I ordered a 6 just in case. It fit great in the waist, but the bust and the shoulders were a little too bulky. It felt like I was wearing a breastplate. That aside, it was a very elegant and high-quality dress, and very expensive looking--like you would have gotten it at a bridal shop. If you also wear a 4 or 6, I would try to go a little smaller and see if the bust is better."
4.0,Silver plated ring  I believe. very Nice !  Very Unique!  different Great For the Price!!  Shiney criss cross  unique ring!!
4.0,"I bought a black set of these to test out a couple of looks, as I wanted to get my lip pierced. The delivery was quick and they came in a small plastic baggy inside a cloth bag. They're small, look real, and are well put together. A couple of people mentioned paint chipping and while I had no issue with that I did have a hard time getting them to stay in place without rubbing against my teeth or pinching my lip to the point I had to take them out.<br /><br />If your lip is not sensitive like mine I think these would be great for any costume or for anyone just wanting to change up their look."
4.0,"I got three of these shirts because I thought they would be great to nurse in, and I was right! They are great for nursing. You just pull one of the front panels to the side and nurse relatively discreetly. The only downfall is that every time you pull a side, it's loses a little elasticity. So after a full day of nursing, the shirt is a little baggy. Probably not the best shirt to have when you are nursing or pumping eight or more times a day. But a toddler? Definitely a good staple to have in the closet."
4.0,It was a stocking stuffer. worked out great.
4.0,"I absolutely love them, they are a perfect fit, I may order 8 more."
4.0,"Overall, the cosplay was AMAZING. Great stitching, the pattern was beautiful, the anemo thing also lights up! It's gorgeous!<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'4 and around 140 pounds, so I ordered a large rather than medium like I usually do.. and oh dear. The shirt choked the life out of me. The pants are a bit tight at the ends, but it's not that bad! It's still very comfy. The tights were perfect and everything else was just amazing. But the shirt is definitely too tight at the collar. It has two zippers, one on the back and one on the side. I could only zip up the one on the side.<br /><br />I'd suggest using safety pins for the cape. It has velcro but the mix of the cape and the shirt, you'll loose all oxygen left inside of your body- the buttons also are a bit loose on the shirt, but its an easy fix. Overall great, just the shirt is way too tight, so probably order two sizes up instead of one (or alter your own!)."
4.0,Another gift so I don't know.
4.0,I am so excited about getting this bracelet.  I looked for hours at charms and can't wait to start filling up my bracelet. I very seldom buy things for myself as I have a large family. I could not resist this purchase.  The bracelet is good quality and as I looked online at similar bracelets this bracelet was priced at a great bargain price. It seems very sturdy and I am hoping it will be something that will last a long time and  I will treasure forever.  It might even be something I would be able to pass down to one of my girls as a great memory of my life. I read somewhere to do a flexibility test. You wrap it around your fingers and check to make sure there is no breaks or kinks in the chain.  It passed this test. I would recommend this bracelet to anyone interested in a charm bracelet. I was given a discount for honest opinion of this product. I honestly would purchase this bracelet at full price
4.0,"Wore to a wedding and it made a splash!  Lots of compliments on how colorful and it was super comfy, even on the dance floor!"
4.0,"I'm so glad I checked the reviews for this dress. I really like the style, it is well made, but I ordered a 3X, and I  wear a 8/M. It really does run small.  For those who are not concerned about the tag size, I recommend this dress.  But size way up."
4.0,A simple top but looks and fits good.
4.0,"The socks fit great and do the job well, so for that, they exceed expectations. The toe holes are kind of long and mine don't fit all the way, but it's not really that big of a deal. Perfect for barre classes :)"
4.0,"Thin material, but love the fit"
4.0,Silicone is very hard and not bendy so it made my ears really sore and agitated when putting them in and taking them out.
4.0,Fit as expected I am a size 16 pants typically an Xl in tops and this fit great in an XL. Because this is a true wrap dress the sizing is a bit flexible and  for a smaller chested girl like me was not as low cut as pictured. While I love the print and color I do have to give this a four star because it is incredibly see through and the sleeves were a lot longer and more over sized the pictured.
4.0,"Great glasses, I love the carrying case, the cleaning wipe and the glasses themselves are quality. I got a coupon to get them a little cheaper for my mouth to be honest but no lies will leave these lips. You have my word. They block the sun nicely and work great as a headband when you are not in the sun. :) I personally like the blue and white bouncing off each other color wise it looks nice and the grip on the ear pieces keep them in place if you are an active sports person."
4.0,"I bought this saree for my 9yr old daughter, who was doing a class project on India. Since it is lower priced and I wasn't expecting a quality item, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the colors and pattern accurately reflect the picture. It's a very lovely piece of fabric. Be aware that the ends are raw and they will fray if you don't stitch them, and the 'blouse' that comes with it is just extra material on the end of the saree which you will have to cut off (Hence, more fraying). It was perfect for what I needed it for."
4.0,Just what I asked for.  Kid loves it.
4.0,"I'm a size 16 normally and I wasn't sure if the XL or XXL would fit, so I bought both sizes. The XL ended up fitting the best although the waist size seemed the approximately the same between the two sizes but the XXL had more room in the thighs down to the ankles so it was baggy on me, this why I kept the XL.<br /><br />The material is soft and I like how grey looked. I loved the side pockets and they are big enough for my LG G7 to fit easily.<br /><br />Here are my issues with these and why they got a 4 star. The inseam measurements in the pictures are wrong. They were suppose to be around 27.5 inches, but they were much longer and I had a decent amount of fabric bunched at my ankles. I measured the actual inseam and it's just a little over 29 inches. However, I can easily fold them under to get ankle length looking leggings. I'm 5' 5"" and most of my height is in my torso so I usually buy leggings with a 27 inch inseam to hit at the ankle, so I thought these would be fine, but as you can see above their measurements are off.<br /><br />The other issue is instead of the whole wide waist being compression to hold up the pants there is a singular thin waist band at the very top that sort of digs into the waist. Luckily there's enough compression throughout the rest of the waist that it doesn't do too much digging and still looks relatively smooth.<br /><br />Although I'm keeping them I probably won't buy additional colors."
4.0,"Great for the price. Super pretty colors and lace. Just made kinda cheap, but didn't expect to be super nice for $14.99. Using as bridesmaids dresses and they look cute! The top is completely see thru between lace though. Sizing up would be needed. My bridesmaids are all about the same size around size 6 and they all got larges"
4.0,"My husband bought me this dress. The shoulders don't quite sit right because I'm short, but the rest of it really shows off my figure. Husband loves it, and I like it a lot."
4.0,A little large and somewhat thin but cute
4.0,"I like that it feels sleek and durable. I just received it in today. The only issue I have is that some of my cards are a little large for it, as I planned to use it for medical cards."
4.0,Very cute! Great fit
4.0,Nice jewelry. Not gaudy or cheap looking. Good for work if you want a little accessory without making  a big statement. Doesn't change color and it is sturdy.
4.0,"Looks great, however it is a little short."
4.0,Not quite the shade of green I thought it was online but cute nonetheless.
4.0,Good fun product
4.0,Very nice quality and even better than the advertised pic but the fitting is a bit off. For wide hips and small tiny chest
4.0,Grandson was very happy and excited
4.0,The dress overall fit perfect..only thing the back of the dress is too short.. If the wind blows  you surely will  have a wardrobe malfunction.
4.0,"Love this dress. Just too big, and too long. Ordered one size up because I figured that it would run small...but that was not the case. I’m still going to keep it and try to shrink it a little. Love it though. It’s so so soft, and very comfy. Plus, the quality is great for the price. Def recommend. Just order your actual size."
4.0,"I really love these boots. You can see the glue a bit around the heel, but its not a big enough thing for me to return them. They are so cute in person, pretty comfortable as well."
4.0,Not a bad dress. It’s comfy. Color is nice. It’s not off the shoulder as seen in the photo. The electric around the color is too tight for it to truly be off shoulder.
4.0,I like it so far will see how long it will keep my cards in place!!
4.0,"Jacket looks to be well made. Fits just right. I really the brass zipper. I would not have bought it if it had a plastic zipper. And i actually like the hood. Warm, but not too much. I would recommend it."
4.0,"If you like a lightweight cotton night shirt, this is a good one to get.  I am very happy to have this one as well as another."
4.0,"[[ASIN:B004PJXCFM 10mm Tungsten Carbide Black Carbon Fiber Wedding Ring Size 9.5]] This ring is true to size and exactly as pictured.  I took a gamble because with this style ring many times it looks great but feels terrible on.  This one is comfortable albeit a tad cumbersome.  Not as much as many men's rings I have tried but noticeable all the same.  The edges are smooth and do not lead to callouses like others have.  It isn't for a short fingered person.  It is attractive, masculine and looks high end for the price.  The carbon fiber inlay in the tungsten is a unique  feature I haven't seen before and I did receive many compliments on it.  I only gave it four stars because as I said it is bulky even though it looks great!  I received this ring at a discount in exchange for leaving this review with my honest opinions of the product."
4.0,"Advertised for kids but fits big. Will need to safety pin the hat to keep it from blowing off. However, this will give kids room to grow if they want to use it later in life."
4.0,"Perfect first little beanie - they are soft, don’t fit too tight and haven’t faded when washed."
4.0,"They are stretchy and comfy.  Too bad they are not fleece lined, even though the description says the fabric is thick--it's not thick per se but they are of good quality material.  I agree with another reviewer's comment about the waist elastic that will roll and bunch.  I tacked it down by using needle and thread.  I haven't tried other skirt leggings from other merchants, but I think I will give them a try because they are less expensive.  $24 for this isn't really a steal, just an average retail price."
4.0,It’s a great purchase for me. It looks nice and goes with almost everything I wear. I’d say the zipper feels more for a lefty.
4.0,"Be aware this is WAY smaller than pictured. It's probably less than an inch tall. I don't know what product they used in the picture, but this is much smaller.<br />That aside, it's very adorable. I got many compliments on it. The chain is not long, it's hung just below my collar bone."
4.0,"Soft and comfy. A little tight at the wrists and forearms, so keep that in mind when picking your size."
4.0,Love the band. Makes it so easy to adjust for your wrist size. Only down is that the whole that gets used often the casing around it cracks. Still holds though.
4.0,"Good material,nice color.Little large for me. Should have got a smaller size."
4.0,Cute. Hubby and I each have a side.
4.0,"I definitely like this a lot! But it does look different from photos. I'm 5' 10&#34; and 215 pounds, for reference. The length only barely covers my butt and it feels a little snug around the forearms, but other than that it's a nice lightweight sweater! The material and thickness are as advertised, and it's fun to wear!"
4.0,"These are super cute and adorable. They fit perfectly and has just enough bling- it's got a cute sparkle. I don't know why people are complaining about that they don't fit or the ball doesn't come off- they are not supposed to and they are probably not wearing them correctly. My order shipped from China and they were packaged poorly.. they arrived bent. Bit I fixed that... Hence, my 4 star rating."
4.0,Fits great and super modest which was what I was looking.
4.0,"The sizing chart was fairly accurate, but the material is very thin. You will definitely need to wear something underneath!"
4.0,"These are great socks and they are aesthetically pleasing. I had been going to work without these socks (working 12 hour shifts) for a couple of weeks and my feet and legs would be so sore and a little swollen at the end of the day. After putting these socks on, I could immediately feel the difference. After a full work day, I came home and took my socks off and my legs and feet felt about 85% better than before and there was absolutely no swelling in sight. Overall, great product. Only 4 stars because they will kind of scrunch down your leg a little bit so then you end up having to pull them up."
4.0,"My daughter wears between a girls 5, sometimes 6. Small (4-6) was way too small, Medium (intermediate 6-8) was just right."
4.0,a nice simple bracelet and is exactly as it looks
4.0,Very sexy costume. Size was just right and it was very cute on.
4.0,They fit perfectly and were good quality for the price.
4.0,"Fit bigger than expected,  ordered a 2t is more like a 3t. Otherwise it's warm and comfy, good quality material"
4.0,Nice and simple with a bright color. It's easy to apply; just snap it on and your done.
4.0,This dress is very pretty. Material is heavy. It have stretch to it. I would go down one size. It fit a little large around armholes. I wear a  extra large  I am 4 ft 11 and weigh 138. The xl ran a little big. I am a 36 dd
4.0,Cute outfit but kind of cheap. No tags inside to determine front and back. Shorts are made of thin material but ok for hot weather. My granddaughter is 3 1/2 weight 29lbs and 39 inches. Ordered size 3
4.0,"Great necklace! I love to wear it. You can tell that it's not the greatest quality, but it looks nice and I'll continue to wear it."
4.0,Tamaño y peso muy cómodo! Classic Disney
4.0,The rings were exactly as described
4.0,"looks good, feels great. Just a size too small."
4.0,"The great thing about these gloves are the increased sizes and liner. I’ve worn these during the latter part of summer into winter in NC. With the correct size, these are comfortable and not stiff. There are two down sides. I haven’t had these very long and haven’t ridden as much as others probably have but there was s at least one area by between two fingers where the glove are separating at the seams. I will buy again as it’s hard to find leather gloves at these sizes with this comfort. The other is don't dryer dry. Some how in two fingers the liners just disappeared with I tried to dry them. So, don't dry but as stated, I would buy again as I just did. Buy another set of gloves for rain."
4.0,These board shorts can be worn anytime in my book.  Mostly as gym shorts but they'll work on the beach too.  They fit perfectly and are comfortable..  I don't think they're quite as long as the photo but maybe it's just me.  They're pretty nice.  No complaints.
4.0,"The chain is beautiful, very nice, very much like it. It’s the same as the picture. It’s beautiful, especially beautiful. The collocation is very beautiful. Next time we continue to patronize it. Super delicate, this price is really worth it. You can buy your favorite baby at ease."
4.0,"The thighs came very quickly, they are soft and have a good stretch (I've washed them already and they still feel like new), and they go over the knee as it says, but it seems like they are made for someone with thin thighs. They gave my somewhat huge thighs a muffin look. They do stay in place and the fabric doesn't roll because of the thickness of my thighs, which I like, so the muffin look doesn't bug me that much. Overall good product."
4.0,"I do love these earrings. They are perfectly stylish and comfortable to wear. My only criticism is that I have thick ears, the post barely fits through my piercing to attach the ball. Perhaps this is how it is supposed to be worn? I dont know, I'm new to these types of earrings."
4.0,A little heavier than I expected but fit is true to size...Love the longer length...Very pretty color.  Will save it for Fall..
4.0,"It's OK, However, I will only wear around the house, really not that cute on me as the model makes it look. It actually feels a bit awkward."
4.0,"I like the dress but the size was 2 sizes too small. It is also not flattering if you have a large behind. Other than that, thick material! Really nice for 30 bucks."
4.0,The socks were as expected.  Fit fine.  Feel fine.
4.0,Way too small for the XL mens.
4.0,"The watch is beautiful. The only thing I don't understand is, why is the 4 IIII. A roman numeral 4 is IV."
4.0,"This is a pretty little pair of earrings. The colors are beautiful and the size is perfect--I can still wear a second pair of studs (or hoops or whatever) with them. I held back the 5th star simply because they are a bit thin and I had to replace the backings with some more reliable ones...don't want these falling out! If you're thinking about getting them, do it. You'll love them."
4.0,Nice bracelet but size should have been included. Too big for me
4.0,"this is a sweet  shade of grey, and has a cute heart shaped design on top of the tank.  I felt this was a little dresser then other regular tank tops. its a cute top! but small only i feel.  I am not ok with my belly showing. (I feel i have a round tummy)  I am 5'3 and weigh about 140.#s and I am a 36D  it went a tad below my belly button.  I do believe if I had a smaller tummy it would fit much better.  It is very cute, so, i will be wearing it under something so my belly doesn't show.<br /><br />it also took a bit to get here<br />I received this product for a discount in return for my honest review.<br />If my review was helpful for you please give that little yes button below a click for me."
4.0,The bk of the watch keep fallin out it came like tht had to fix it bk in twist other than that it working great
4.0,This skirt and shorts fit great. If only it had a panty liner instead of the stitching I would have given it 5 stars. Otherwise it's awesome and I will be reordering from them again.
4.0,"This is a nice, affordable watch; very basic with no frills or anything fancy. My husband says he wishes the watch face was just a little easier to read. Since it doesn’t have numbers, those thin little boxes can blur together at first glance. It comes in a nice box, on a mini, puffy pillow, making it an easy item to gift. I’d recommend this watch if you want something very basic, functional, and inexpensive."
4.0,Luggage held up well on a two week cross country journey.  Actually got lots of compliments.  It has the look of much more expensive luggage.
4.0,seem a little short in length.  I wear a 7-1/2 or 8.  I ordered an 8 and my toes touch the end.
4.0,Dope. Super warm. It is 100% polyester fleece so it doesn't really breathe but it's so comfortable that I don't care.
4.0,I've had different sets of packing cubes but my other sets would have zipper problems. This set works well.  The second zippers compress the clothes to reduce the volume of the items in the suitcase.  The main zipper holds well and keeps items in the packing cube. This was much sturdier than the regular packing cubes I had.
4.0,"It's nice. It's handmade so it's not ""slick"". I like that. Feels more authentic."
4.0,"The hat color isn't as vibrant in color as the picture shows. Each piece is a different texture.  The necklace is felt, earrings and bracelet are faux leather and the hat is a dull looking felt. Overall it looks nice."
4.0,The sizing on these blazers is irregular. I usually get an Xl in a jacket to feel comfortable. The XL was way to big and the sleeves too long . I exchanged it for a large and it barely fits! I just wear it open.
4.0,Beautiful! However this is alittle tight and ordered a side up. Does lay funny across the chest area.
4.0,"Fits really cute, excellent quality"
4.0,Top pocket broke in about 2 months. Besides that it has tons of room.
4.0,"These are really comfortable and great quality. I’m 5’6” currently sitting at 145lbs postpartum so I bought a medium which is the size I wear in their other leggings while I was pregnant and postpartum (small prepregnancy) and the mediums are small, I’m guessing it’s due to the lack of stretch in the different material. I’m keeping these so when I am back to my normal weight I can wear them and I’ll purchase the large for now since they are really comfortable."
4.0,"Love how soft and comfortable it is, and that it has pockets!"
4.0,"Good quality, fits good and is very cute. Great for casual wear or to work out in. My only complaint is that the bottom rides up every 2 seconds, have to constantly pull it down but otherwise I love them"
4.0,"After ordering 4 blouses on Amazon and returning all four, I ordered this blouse. It is exactly as described on the Amazon page. The fiber content is rayon, as described. All of the others were described as 'cotton blend', but when I received them they were polyester. This blouse is very cute but, unfortunately, was too big for me! Since I ordered the smallest size, I will have to return it! I will purchase from this company in the future."
4.0,Fits great! True to size! Comfortable and flattering.
4.0,"Great for the money, ordered for my 94 yr old father, easy to maneuver and nice quality!"
4.0,Not fancy and stylish enough but I did like them.
4.0,it's ok not a big fan of large collars...
4.0,I like the color and it is very light weight. My only issue is it's very tight on the upper arm so I had to fold it down a little bit. Maybe it will stretch as time goes on but it will definitely help me while working outside all day.
4.0,I really like this!  I wish the sides were closed though.
4.0,"The bag is vinyl and not what I’m used to. There is not a lot of room in the pockets, but the bag has a low profile. I don’t walk with it, but probably a good bag if you did."
4.0,"I have been looking for some slimming body suits for awhile. Order up a size as the M is really more like a S.  I originally ordered M because I am 5’1 and weighed 145 and have a 36c bust. The M was slightly tight but<br />not uncomfortable. The front and back thigh areas were high on the butt and thigh area (imagine the 90’s high thigh bathing suits) but I like that because I have a voluptuous rear end and if the back is too tight, it “cuts” the cheek line. I definitely reccomendation going up a size for a precise fit. However I have been dieting and exercising and have recently gone down to 134 and this M fits perfectly and still smoothes out all my midriff lines. In the past, once I got to that weight, the M size woud be too loose in the middle and the S would be too tight on the bust. The material is firm so even the M holds me in pretty well."
4.0,"This dress was a pleasant surprise.  I had doubts about what size to order, but the sizing information is accurate and the x-large is just right for my 5'8&quot;, 155 lb. body.  The dress material is thicker and heavier than I expected, and it is stretchier than I imagined it would be.  But I'm not at all disappointed!  The peplum flare is modest, but the back slit is not!  My only criticism is that the skirt section tends to ride up.  Overall, a nice dress, especially for the money."
4.0,I like these alot but the &#34;top&#34; is a bit too big. I don't have full lips so it doesn't look great on me like it would look on a lady with Fuller lips.
4.0,"It's nice and my kid likes it. The top is fine, the skirt is the one that's on the large side. But I'm hoping she'll grow into it soon."
4.0,This i alsi bought for my coworker she loves this dress and will be wearing it to a funeral.
4.0,"These sunglasses are quite unique, although they are mirrored you can see still the persons eyes behind the mirrored lens.  They are light weight and have a great shape. I have received many compliments on them in the week that I've had them."
4.0,This little purse is cute and great for a day out. My only complaint is there is a scratch on the purse and it's noticeable.
4.0,XL was huge. I wear XL shirts and should've ordered a Large hoodie.
4.0,Nice bag to take to my son's games. I didn't want the big bag like the other team mom's were getting. This one was small for just enough items and it's cross over.
4.0,I ordered this for my daughter in blue and gray. It fits her great and stays in place! It has a grippy material along the inside that keeps it in place. I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
4.0,These were super cute! Gave them to my niece as a gift. Wish they were just packaged a little better as the fabric ones had many hard folds.
4.0,I ordered this jumpsuit about 2 months ago in size large and it fitted my hips just the way I wanted it to. Not too tight just loose and flowing. I am 5ft 6&#34; and normally wear a size 6 or medium but I wanted it a little loose at the bottom<br />So I ordered the large. The belt made the outfit complete and beautiful. The only thing is that the colors are brighter than shown on the website other than that I am satisfied with this purchase.
4.0,The quality is great not going to just fall apart. I'm a small and this felt like a large. But cute and fun as a cover.
4.0,"Love me some Contigo! Coffee stays hot for a long time. Does not spill as well. I highly recommend this travel mug. I take it with me to work everyday! No free coffee at work so have to take some with me every morning. On days when i'm busy and forget about my coffee, it is still warm by lunch time. It is a very good product! Very happy with my purchase. Totally worth it!"
4.0,Fits great and very comfy! Just like the picture.
4.0,It came about the time it said it would was very cute just as pretty as pictured the clamps were a little hard to keep on ear though
4.0,"Fabric better than most stretchy dresses. Proportions perfect.<br />Very happy with this purchase for a 1960's chic theme!<br />I got a size 10. maybe could have went down 1 size. 5'5"" 158."
4.0,Have washed and worn it.  It isn't wrinkly and is comfortable.  Would order again.
4.0,I am wearing these today.  They are working out very well.  My view is that a small shoulder pad gives a garment expression.
4.0,This is a Christmas gift; I will not be able to accurately review
4.0,"love the sweater, and bought a larger size but find it a bit too tight.  Maybe it's me."
4.0,"My husband liked it, but it has faded a little after only a few washes. Overall though, satisfied."
4.0,It is super cute but I wish I would’ve got one or two sizes smaller. I will buy another one and this one is perfect for bed.
4.0,I bought this as a gift. No where does the packaging state that it has Swarovski Crystals. The bracelet is nice.
4.0,"Well made, looks good. I got two sizes larger than normal and it's a little big. I would get one size larger than normal if I had it to do over again. It's pretty clear, though, that sizes run smaller than we're used to.<br /><br />Quality is good. It even comes with a spare button in a bag, as the nicer shirts sometimes do."
4.0,I will use this for casual wear and everyday needs.  The blue with cheery and upbeat w/o being loud.
4.0,"Im 5'6 165lbs and US size 8/10, bought a size 10 and it fits my waist and top area like a glove! I got lots of compliments. The material is thick so hides my bra line fat well! My only complaint is the bottom is a little loose and long, wish it was tighter on my legs but I can hem that and easy fix.  Wouldn't stop me from buying another!"
4.0,"They fit true to size.. I was a little unimpressed, a bit more distressing and a darker color than I anticipated. They are pretty stretchy but the material feels quite cheap.. for an amazon purchase they’re ok though"
4.0,"Ordered it a size bigger than i needed. Glad I did. Fits good. Bought others from this company I had to return due to incorrect sizing. Order a size up ladies. Overall tjough, love the dress."
4.0,"I am 5ft 10in, 175lbs and the medium was a perfect fit. It weighs 8.9oz (5.9oz of fleece material) and will function as a great active thermal layer."
4.0,The thermal underwear does have stretch panels to make it fit somewhat.
4.0,"I ordered these to wear for nighttime sleeping.  They run quite small. I ordered a Medium and I wear a medium/small. The  molded cups barely fit my breasts. I'm a 34 DD and it didn't contain me. I wish I would have ordered a larger size or two but I had already washed them.  These feel free and look great, just plan on getting a size bigger than you expect."
4.0,great belt Highly recomend
4.0,Good Quality!!!
4.0,Only dislike was the size of the chain thought it would be a bit thicker but other than that I wear it everyday I really like it
4.0,A little thin on material but who cares once you have a jacket on.
4.0,"I love it, I was worried that it was going to be linen or something that wasn’t stretchy but it’s very stretchy. The prints are sown together just a awkward like there’s a T. rex with its head cut off by the seam but for a Valentine’s Day outfit I didn’t want to spend very much and this exceeds the quality I was expecting! I ordered December 26th and recieved it January 10th! Even though it’s expected delivery was January 18- Feb 11th!!!"
4.0,Nicely made. Color not as bright as expected
4.0,Es un poco corto para hombre resto está bien
4.0,These are long!  I can tuck it in and it isn't going to slip up.  I love that!  They are super soft and clingy. I wish there was a bit less clingy...
4.0,So cute. It sticks but falls off after few hours
4.0,The unfinished hem has a tendency to fray.
4.0,"Cute, easy to use. Just wish the clasp had been in the middle of the wallet. You can't over stuff it or it wont close."
4.0,Got this for my brother in-law for Christmas. It is a good quality build and it looks great. He loved it so I can't ask for  much more.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I would recommend it to a friend.
4.0,Sleeves are a little wide for my liking but overall fits well
4.0,"The fit is great! I love the strachiness of the fabric, and the cut is extremely flattering. I also bought a bright orange petticoat for underneath, and it sets the dress off! One thing I did notice were along the seams thread was hanging out that had to be trimmed back. Only thing keeping it from a 5. Washing instruction indicate dry cleaning only, so keep it in mind."
4.0,"Nice and cute T-Shirt, just run small"
4.0,"These aren't the best quality, but they definitely aren't bad!! They take some ""fluffing"" when they come out of the package, as they are really matted at first, but once they sorta come to life theyre not too bad!<br />I ordered these last minute for a rave, they were cheap, shipping was fast & they got the job done! I can't complain!<br />Bonus points for the elastic being good enough to hold these up all night!! Lots of dancing and they stayed on my little legs all night! :)"
4.0,Great item but was too big for my nephew.
4.0,"I read several reviews before purchasing this. I went with what majority said, and went up a size I'm usually a medium, so I went with a large. Bottoms fit well, but as expected the top was tight. I can still wear it though and I was expecting so since the reviews! The material feels like any other bathing suit for this price. I mainly ordered this for the bottoms anyways :) can't wait to wear this out by the pool!"
4.0,I brought the wallet for my dad after reading the positive reviews online. I received it today and gave it to him. I and my dad agree the wallet is a very nice color and and has the built in RFID protection feature which everyone SHOULD HAVE especially nowadays! The only reason I did not give it 5/5 stars is because the wallet--although looks beautiful and is made of good quality nappa leather---seems kind of light weight. Maybe for some people this is a positive feature but my dad and I agree that we wish it had more of a substantial heft to it like old fashioned wallets. In terms of how it holds up in the long term we shall have to see since we got it today. The fit and finish seems to be good but it is to early to tell now. I will post an update in the future
4.0,"these sunglasses are good if you are NOT in the desert sun. comfortable, cute but have metal frames which warm up when its 115 outside lol"
4.0,The sleeves are just a bit short when he lifts up his arms. Not a huge issue though! The material is so soft and he says it’s warm enough in our 36 degree WA weather!
4.0,The goggles help to stop the smoke but not completely. Pretty handy eye protection for weed trimming.
4.0,I found them not to be light filtering enough..but helps a little
4.0,I like the rainbow color with bigger lenses it is cool and light weight when we wear it doesn't feel like we are wearing a glass. So light weight and also UV rays protection. So this glass is so cool and extra. I as very much satisfied with this product.
4.0,Great dreas and very cute but runs too small.
4.0,Love the glasses---But the frames are too &#34;showy&#34;
4.0,"Perfect fit, loose and comfortable great for holiday season as the extra pounds come on. Decent quality, comfortable, washes and wears well."
4.0,"Looks and holds well. Get the next size up, they run small."
4.0,Little slow on delivery for amazon.  Great product...buy with confidence.
4.0,"I am 5’6” and about 135 lbs.  The Medium was too tight, but I like my tanks to be a little loose.  These were skin tight.  Returning and ordered a Large. Hope the Large works"
4.0,"I ordered this because I thought the Snow Leopard pattern was cute and noticed that this had a fastening button as well as a small zippered pocket that I thought could be handy.<br /><br />I received an a longer fur in an Ocelot pattern rather than the Snow Leopard pattern. The fur is soft and the liner is kind of a velveteen which feels nice. Mine did not have either the fastener or the pocket. I still like the item I received so not going to send it back, but it was not what was displayed on the sales page either so it wasn't what I was expecting."
4.0,loved it but didn't fit right was too small and they didn't have a bigger size :(
4.0,Love the material and the style and the quality.  Fits OK  but is a little more snug than expected for size ordered.
4.0,"They R Very Pretty & Alot better than I expected,I got them for my 2 Granddaughters,Thinking that they would be able 2 play dress up,But they R much nicer than for Play,,My daughter only allows them for church 💒 & special acacations❗ They R definitely worth the small price❗ 💒💎"
4.0,"Sent it to small, but it's nice"
4.0,Super cute design and love all the sparkles and lights. They are just kinda shaped weird like a clog. Maybe that was intentional?
4.0,"The Hugitout Women's Natural Cowrie Shell Bracelet is a charming little shell bracelet made with natural Cowie shells and a single gold plated shell in the middle. This fun, casual look that will remind you of a seaside vacation and is a perfect accessory for your summer wardrobe. I have small wrists, and I was able to adjust the sizing to fit, so this would also be an excellent gift for a young teen."
4.0,We like this dress but the fit was not right for my niece. The material and style is very nice. We had to return it.
4.0,Love the dress but it runs large<br />I’m a true small and this was so loose around the back. Fit fine everywhere else
4.0,Good padding. Comfortable fit. No complaints.
4.0,For Xmas for my sister and she absolutely loved it
4.0,It is quite roomy but I expected it to be. Wanted it for lounging outside after the pool while in Italy.
4.0,Loved this !!
4.0,I love the shirt! It was a hit with my science fiction loving colleagues! It held up over many washes. Colors are still good.
4.0,Just a little small but still fit good
4.0,Only thing I dislike is the cards stick a lot at first. After a few weeks it’s much easier
4.0,il me fait tres bien et confortable
4.0,Love bonnets and this is a nice one.
4.0,I typically wear a small/med and ordered a large based on comments and really happy I did! It fits great but for sure order up on sizing.
4.0,"These came a bit large, and aren't as circular as they are elliptical and stretch your ears horizontally."
4.0,"Although the skort is really cute, it does not have the side pockets needed to put your tees, ball markers, divot repair tool.  The back pockets are okay to place your glove. Also, the size chart is misleading, I ordered a small and when I tried it, it was way too large. I had to return it. So sad."
4.0,"cute, comfy"
4.0,Ok quality for the price
4.0,"cute, purchased as a prank, but they're proving useful."
4.0,This is so pretty and I love how it looks but the bottom got caught in a rolling chair when I'd sit down and now it's torn. :(<br />I've only worn it twice.<br />Be careful if you suit in chairs with wheels!
4.0,"Great quality and soft.  I am still deciding whether to keep it or not though.  It has no shape to it, so it doesn't really flatter my body."
4.0,"Soft, Comfy and great for indoors!"
4.0,They fit great for yoga
4.0,"Nice shirt, not as fitted as picture shows."
4.0,"I bought them as a gift, they are really cute and fun!"
4.0,Pretty pattern -  7X fit my Size 20 American body.  Had some very prominent round pads in the chest area - glad they were removable!  Otherwise would have looked like I was trying to smuggle 2 turtles into the pool.
4.0,"It's VERY good for it's price. 20 tongue rings were all there. Some of the tongue rings are piercing rings, so they're WAY too long to wear. I just use the balls from them on the bar that I had already been using. The holes in the balls are a liiiiittle wonky, but it works out anyway."
4.0,"From someone who works from home and often walk around barefoot, these slippers are a revelation. Great comfort, great construction and decent looks are the high points. Slippers have fairly decent arch support (would have preferred a touch more though - that's why 4 stars instead of 5). Surprisingly by wearing short athletic socks with these, my feet stay much cooler and don't sweat. The lining can be fairly warm (especially living in FL), but the socks do actually help."
4.0,"Fits well every where but the rear end, that's a little bit snug. Otherwose perfect!"
4.0,"As advertised, good for price. Agree with other reviewers that it shrinks significantly. Ordered a size up, washed it once and it was perfect."
4.0,I'm 66.5 inches tall. I ordered a size small and they were a little long on me.  I was able to pull them around enough to remove any runs and folds.  They were very comfy and warm.
4.0,It is cute and has plenty of pockets and space.  Only complaint is it is a little too soft and floppy.  Hard to find divided sections and what is inside.
4.0,"This is a beautiful cowl.  Love the layering and everything seems well made.  Can't complain about the material as it is common stuff.  Actually, this is just what I was expecting and I did order a size up.  I think in these it is good to do."
4.0,"I like it, it's a little big but I do enjoy the look and affordability"
4.0,"Very cute costume, however the eyes do not stand up as shown on the photo. We had to use pipe cleaners to sturdy up the antennas and that seemed to work."
4.0,The fitment on this is a little bit small when compared to the size chart however not that small as to go up a complete size. More or less wife sucked it up for it anyway and had an amazing night doing so. I've been provided a discount in exchange for my honest review of this item provided here.
4.0,"Love the shirt! Soft and comfortable, however,  size came in a little to big. Ordered a large, should have gotten medium. Still looks cute with Jeans or leggings!"
4.0,"I wanted a casual black skirt for a tropical vacation and this was perfect.  I originally ordered the Large based on other's reviews (I didn't want it skin-tight), but ended up exchanging it for a Medium which is what I normally wear.  The large added excess fabric to my hips which I don't need and the Medium fit fine.  I wore a pair of Jockey Skimmers underneath for some light support.  The fabric itself is a bit thin, and I wouldn't recommend it for a work environment but it was great for my purpose."
4.0,Nice costume fits to size however the side items to wrap on legs did keep falling off that’s my only complaint either then that was very different.
4.0,The material is thinner  than  I expected. If you compare  them  2 Under  Armour or some of the other  name  brands  you will be  disappointed but they are usable. I bought  XL size
4.0,"solid colored dresses are a little larger than the prints.  So, slightly longer and looser than expected,  but flattering none the less"
4.0,This is some beautiful ice!!! It looks rich and expensive. It fulfills my bling requirement perfectly. The only reason I am giving this a 4 out of 5 is because the clasp was difficult to unfasten when I tried to take it off.<br /><br />The seller has excellent customer service skills. I have my eye on two more pieces already.
4.0,"A little smaller than what I expected, but work well."
4.0,"Really pretty and breezy. Just a little too big for me. Overall, I like it"
4.0,Sizing chart is off. It was bigger than the chart says.  It’s cute but a little big.
4.0,I love it. Only complaint is the coins come out.
4.0,"Glasses fit and feel really nicely. Nicely built and the matte feels great. Quality glasses for really cheap.<br /><br />Only downside is that the lenses are so dark its almost hard to see if its not super bright out. Eyes need time to adjust just like seeing in a dark room, after a little while you can see better."
4.0,Beautifully made and a little Snug for curvy girls like me
4.0,This is the only duster that I could find in the style that I wanted. A little see-through but very cute and fit well. I am 5'6&#34; 125 lbs and ordered a small.
4.0,"It fits a little tight, but over all, I love this shirt! Very soft and buttery smooth. Almost like LLR."
4.0,Great case! Fit my phone perfect. The only thing is that it doesn't activate (or wake up) my phone whenever I open the case. Other then that perfect case!
4.0,Love the socks but they are medium weight not thick.  They are shorter in height than I expected.  They are very cute.
4.0,I liked this purse because of the chain with the heart it showed and it didn't come with it 😳
4.0,"the size is perfect, think for the price, it's a nice belt."
4.0,"So this coat is super warm, it fits well. The only issue is the zipper. It is constantly separating at the bottom. If it had a better quality zipper, I would give this 5 stars."
4.0,I will give it 5 star if the straps didn't loose on both sides. But easy to fix though. Just sewed by hand. All in all it was perfect!
4.0,My son loves it. Warm and toasty. But fit a bit small. Would get a larger size next time.
4.0,"These boots are very cute/stylish.  They run a little small; I normally wear 7 ordered 7.5 and they fit perfectly.  They are definitely not boots you can do a lot of walking in, but overall a good buy."
4.0,"I like these a lot, just wish the post was in the middle of the back instead of on the side.  They hand slightly awkward because of this."
4.0,So far so good.. Only con it had two air bubbles on the out side of case as if its metal contact paper but looks nice not noticeable and my husband loves it...it has weight too it also very sturdy..
4.0,"My wife bought these for working our and hot yoga.  She likes them.  Nice colors, light weight, wash well, and are not too tight."
4.0,I bought these pants as a gift for my son and they fit him just fine.  He enjoys wearing them. Happy with the purchase.
4.0,I bought several of these for christmas present and everyone really liked them.  There's a dozen different versions to fit different personalities and it's a good price.
4.0,Way warm
4.0,I really love the look and feel of this outfit. I will definitely order in different colors.
4.0,I ordered an XXL and it the fit was a little snug. Other than that I really like the dress.
4.0,These are great except they pill.  A LOT
4.0,"Very sheer. Material is somewhat rough, but for the price, I like it."
4.0,"My daughter wore this for Halloween. The costume had a slight flaw, which someone repaired with a type of fabric tape. It was serviceable and there were some nice details like glittery eyes on the skull borders in the sleeves. Hoped it would at least come with the eye patch, but we were able to find one at Target on clearance."
4.0,Great Christmas gift...
4.0,"Shipment was fast, received it in less than 2 weeks. The top runs a bit small but is very pretty! If you have large breast do not buy it. I wear a 34b and it fits perfect"
4.0,"Nice materials, really pretty top. Sleeves are wayyyy too long though. Also wish it was a bit longer. I’m 5’2” and 110lbs and got a small. It’s definitely the right size but fits a bit funky. May keep it and hem the sleeves."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:bd9e6271701df4b7671307e9e7dfa2f0]] Bueno llevo un día con el anillo espero que me aguante antes que se ponga negro supongo 😅
4.0,I really like how warm these are and they fit great but they bunch up behind the knees and the coloring is a bit weird. It’s patchy in places. Overall I might try a different brand but these work for now.
4.0,I wore these with turquoise earrings and red lipstick. Perfect combo.
4.0,Very nice fit strong magnet clasp
4.0,"My boys love these necklaces. They are 8 and 11 years old and athletes. My only criticism is that some of the clasps have broken over time, but can't beat the price!"
4.0,"Order 1 size up. So if you're a medium buy a large. I purchased this shirt for my husband and he loves it, but needed 1 size up for his shoulder width, so I've stolen it :) The color has faded ever so slightly but the design is still vibrant."
4.0,"I needed a bra/cami combo for a dress I wore to a gala. The dress was sheer and I needed something with a relatively deep V. This worked great! There was no need to wear a bra underneath as it is padded, but speaking of padded. The WHOLE thing is a thick padded material. Do not expect to get something thin with just bra cup inserts. The entire thing is a thick squishy material. It did make my girls look great so no harm done. It pulls you in without squeezing you to death, there is no saggy material.<br /><br />I rated this 4/5 because of how thick it was overall (may be a turn-off for a heavy sweater), and that I wish it was a little longer. I felt the need to pull it down all night. But it 100% did it's job I'm just being a brat. It was inconspicuous, you could hardly see it in the V area, and it blended right in under my dress."
4.0,"They are super cute I just didn’t order the right size, that’s my fault but they will get worn until they no longer fit her!"
4.0,Thin fabric so not too hot. Super comfy. Bathroom not super easy since it’s a button and not string tie. Otherwise love
4.0,"The built, quality and the connectors are good and easy to work with.  There's room for improvements.  As this board would probably be designed into a system, CF card could be the storage and the power source would probably be hooked up to a switch.  Upon power cycle the music always plays from the first song in the CF card,  This is not ideal.  It should remember which song it was playing when the power is interrupted."
4.0,"i like it, the flat bits on each end are very small. i don't know why but i was expecting them to be bigger but thats probably my fault because they look exactly like the photo. its very light"
4.0,"I received my packet of 40 finger lights today, and while they are fun for the kids, not all 40 worked.  Some were low on battery, a few were out of batteries, and some were smashed.  Since they're cheap plastic toys, I didn't expect them all to work.  But just make sure to inspect and test them before handing out to the kids.  My 5 year-old thinks they're quite cool!"
4.0,It has more space that other wallets I have tried in the past and like the design.
4.0,Love the bracelets.  The black one had two more beads than the white which made it too big for my daughter's wrist but we removed two beads and restrung the bracelet and now it's perfect!
4.0,"Love the dress, however the zipper placement is off. It's a side zipper but it's too far towards the back of the dress to zip it up on your own."
4.0,great cheap sunglasses.
4.0,Love the hat. The gloves are not good for snow.
4.0,Nice light weight hoodie. Fits as expected. My daughter loves it👍
4.0,"The style is pretty funky, but they're comfortable and do reduce eye strain at the computer! The yellow tint of the lenses is very unflattering (makes one look like one has liver failure), so just keep that in mind."
4.0,If the shoes are really dirty it will not clean it properly.
4.0,"Great value for the set of bras.  Not very supportive if you're larger chested, but good enough."
4.0,"My son played the Grinch in a Haunted Hayride scene. The mask is exactly as pictured & the price was perfect & arrived on time.  I gave it 4 stars as I needed to cut bigger openings at the nose, mouth & eyes & cut openings at the ear because the kid wanted to see & hear & breathe easier."
4.0,Great material great price. It wasn't as forgiving as my mom bod needs tho.
4.0,Very please with this piece. I thought the earring were going to be too small but they are also great. It is a nice size not as large as I thought (prefer larger) but it is a nice size. It is plastic but it looks more on the expensive side. I have ordered lots of jewelry and some of them are so cheap looking that I was a little worried when I ordered this. But I am happy with the quality of this.
4.0,I bought an XS. My bra size is 38B and it's not tight in that area. The material is good but the color isn't the same as the picture.
4.0,"I got a medium but I was swimming in it. I loved it enough to replace with a small. It's a beautiful, flattering dress.<br />Update after a few wears & washes: the fabric is pilling/fuzzy where my purse and seatbelt rubs against it. The other fabric is fine. So it's cheap, but so is the price tag. I don't think this was a smart long-term investment, but I still love the dress."
4.0,Appears cheaply made
4.0,"It's exactly what I wanted, and a good weight.  But it fits very large.  I should have gotten one size smaller.  (And if I hadn't needed it quickly, I would have exchanged it.)  But I like the shirt."
4.0,Every thing I expected. Note the sleeves didn’t want to cover shoulders. They are more off shoulder.
4.0,The numb that clasp them doesn't stay and pops off a lot
4.0,A little bigger than I thought they would be but I do like them.
4.0,"It's pretty, it sparkles. For me it is a bit to big for me though."
4.0,"Took really long to come I guess because it's coming from China , but I like the rings to avoid color change put clear nail polish on it .."
4.0,The shirt is good quality. I love the choice of both white buttons and or black. It was a bit small. Hoping it doesn't shrink when washed. I normally wear a small and I purchased a medium to make sure I had room for moving around while working. The medium fits like a small. I would order up a size just to be on the safe side. Other than that it is a great shirt.
4.0,"Fits great, not see through at all but will show all your curves and imperfections. I bought these to layer under some running shorts for colder season so works out great for me! also great with my long sweater shirts."
4.0,They were a gift for grandson needed for boot camp.
4.0,Warm and comfy.  Just wish they were slightly wider for me.
4.0,"If you need to dress nice this is a great skirt to wear.  This is very versitile to wear.  If you don't want to fold it over, you can wear a &#34;high waisted&#34; skirt.  One could even wear this as a dress.<br /><br />This is made with the softest material ever.  My husband's grandma really loved the feel of this. To me, it's almost too soft. Almost makes 1 feel naked it's so soft.  It is very form fitting.  I ordered a large, since I'm pear shaped.  I almost wish I ordered an extra large.  It's not tight tight, but still leaves nothing to the imagination.  It begins to flare out slightly above the knees. It doesn't flare out a lot, but the bottom is at least twice the size as the top.<br /><br />It does not restrict movement in any way. If I didn't pull it up more and fold it, it would drag the ground.  It's way too soft and could easily snag/rip if care isn't taken to ensure it doesn't drag the ground.  I'm not sure I would wear this in cooler weather without leggings or the such.  It could easily be worn with flip flops, sandals, boots, heels, etc.  I'm positive this could be worn for the nicest events to dress up for.<br /><br />☆☆DISCLAIMER: I did receive this MsBasic Modal flared Maxi skirt  at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest, unbiased, and own original opinion. However, I leave ratings based on the product and NOT the price."
4.0,"Little smaller than expected but not too bad. It’s extremely soft. I got the lime one and it looks a lot more like highlighter yellow than lime. Little bummed about that, but life goes on."
4.0,"The small size is WAY to small!! I am 5'3"", 130 pounds and 34A cup who wears a Small top in everything but this did not fit.  It was skin tight and I could barely get it over my head. The tank top itself is very nice, made out of great material and has a built in bra top. I'm going to exchange for a Medium and hope it fits because I really love this top!"
4.0,"Color is spot on, fits the watch perfectly, has been more durable than the original so far, I've been wearing for a few months now."
4.0,"Mom loves it, got it for her 50th birthday celebration. Could’ve gotten away with a smaller size, but it’s okay she’ll be comfortable."
4.0,"should have listened to the other review, it did turn out smaller then expected."
4.0,"I like just about everything about this, other than having to remove the one side every time I change my pants, (daily). All in all great product, looks sharp, super comfy, price point is perfect."
4.0,They're socks ...
4.0,"Nice pj's, but top is a bit small."
4.0,"sturdy, as expected."
4.0,A little small but so soft and loose I love it.
4.0,"These goggles are ok. I might look for another pair in the near future.<br /><br />- As other reviews mention, these goggles are anti-fog only for the first couple of swims. I haven't owned these long and they are now just like any foggy pair of goggles out there. This wouldn't bother me as much if they didn't claim to be anti-fog. Now when I have to tilt my head awkwardly to read the timer I get annoyed that these goggles aren't doing what the name intended. People are suggesting spraying anti-fog solution to &#34;fix&#34; the issue, but that doesn't fix the goggles directly. Just be ready for the same fogged up lenses you would expect with other goggles.<br /><br />- I'll probably never use the clip in the strap since goggles don't need them and I'm not used to it. I don't see it as a value-added feature.<br /><br />- The nose bridge is also detachable as 3 sizes are provided with the product. It's good to have this option. I switched to the middle size and felt the bridge prongs poking into my nose, especially when pressing the lenses onto my face. I then switched to the larger size and I can still feel the bridge when I press on the lenses. It's not distracting while swimming, but I never had this issue with &#34;normal&#34; goggles.<br /><br />I'll still rate this product at 4 stars. It's a bang-for-your-buck pair and perhaps buy some anti-fog solution like you would do for any other pair of goggles. I do like the case, which does have small holes on the bottom for aeration. UV protection doesn't hurt either."
4.0,"Great shirts, great quality. Fit was right on. They took a little longer to arrive than expected."
4.0,The small one is cute and pretty. The larger one is too big
4.0,"The material is very soft and it’s definitely stretchy. They fit very snug and feel pretty breathable. I haven’t washed them yet so I’m not sure how the fabric upholds, but with how soft it feels you might want to put these in a delicate wash instead of just a normal cycle."
4.0,Has an adjustable strap but if too tight will mark the nose but not fall.  Comfortable to wear around neck and bring up as needed.  Good quality for the price.  Took a bit too long to get considering its prime.
4.0,They don't look like the picture
4.0,"Perfect for under my scrubs!  Soft and thin. Fits as expected.  I ordered a medium and I am 5'3&#34;, 127 lbs, 34DD."
4.0,Really runs on the small side.
4.0,Fits nice and fabic is nice and drapes nice
4.0,"Wife liked it and when she is happy, I'm happy."
4.0,"Nice necklace. It is made from plastic. The color looks orange, Not red. I wanted a red color. Again, it is nice if you want an orange-ish - gold colored necklace. It's cheap, but no one has to know. I recommend it. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the color."
4.0,"I like the material which is sturdy and comfortable. The sleeves are a little long, but I wear them pushed back without any issues. This was a nice addition to my casual clothes."
4.0,"The gray and olive ones perfect! The pink one ended up being a little ‘tighter’ or had less give. The black the hem was completely uneven, 4” longer in one spot! They are comfortable, just inconsistent."
4.0,"This is a well made locket. It is big though, keep that in mind. Good for pics. Unfortunately, the warning is to keep it away from sweat. I wear my lockets 24/7 outside of the shower so it doesnt match my lifestyle. Great statement piece though"
4.0,Looks great with my bracelets hope they stay shiny silver and don't tarnish
4.0,"My only con is that it is a BRIGHT red, not this subdued burgundy in the photo.<br /><br />But im very chesty and this fit wonderfully."
4.0,"great fit, very comfortable..I am a little overweight and the fit was very flattering"
4.0,"These are quite the bargain for FR pants, the only issue I have with them is the fabric is quite rough and chaffed my skin in places that I wasn't used to .<br />The quality of these seems to be very good and they should last quite well."
4.0,"Very cute necklace! I have issues with cheep metal and this didn't break me out! I couldn't wear the earrings tho, gave them to my teenage niece. This looks very real and great with most work outfits. Would def recommend this to a friend and try other products from this seller."
4.0,Birthday present for my daughter. She loves them.
4.0,This covers my back fat - what I wanted. Adjustable at shoulders and in front center. I like the large complete coverage I got with this bra. The fabric is slightly stiff that’s why I only gave 4 instead of 5 stars. I am hoping it will soften up as I wash it.
4.0,Comfy without being lumpy- Nice form fitting. My only suggestion is better quality stitching. Waist band tends to get loose threads after a couple washes.
4.0,These were a gift for my grandsons. They liked them but I don’t know if they used the Bluetooth yet.
4.0,Beautiful purse. It looks much better in person. Very fancy and elegant
4.0,nice skull cap
4.0,"A little more plastic-y (and fake) than I expected, but It still looks pretty sleek and there are plenty of compartments. If you use it to hold 2 passports, though, you don't have too much room for anything else."
4.0,Pretty but returned.
4.0,"This was exactly what I was looking for,,,if only they fit!  I ordered up a size from my usual Large to XL. They did not have that loose casual look I was hoping for and they do not sell an XXL. Disappointed.<br />5'6', 168 lbs"
4.0,This was just for the one lightweight navy cardigan with flowers that are pictured. It's very pretty but keep in mind that it's very lightweight so wash it carefully.
4.0,"So - if you're taller and wear this as a dress, depending on how you're shaped, you may not like it...I have smaller chest and larger rump...it's way cuter on me as a skirt"
4.0,"At first looking at it, looks big. But when I try it on its was kinda to small. Even though I bought size M. But anyways it's comfortable."
4.0,"The scarf is beautiful and the pashmina and silk combination is very soft. One side is mostly white with black designs while the other side is the opposite being mostly black with white designs. I chose this color combination because it can go with nearly any outfit. The quality is excellent. I was surprised that with so much fabric there were no snags in the material at all. There were a few loose threads hanging from the fringe, but nothing that compromises the design or quality. My scarf measures 31 inches wide and 75 inches long (not counting the fringe), which is a few inches wider and longer than the listing states.<br /><br />There are so many different ways to wear this scarf. The listing shows it used as a shawl in 3 different ways, as well as one scarf position. I research online and found multiple other ways to tie it to get different scarf affects. I even saw people using similar scarfs as shirts and skirts. I wish the company would include instructions on how to do some of the different ties or make a product specific video and include a link with the purchase though. I do sometimes find it hard to wrap/tie the scarf where the tags aren't showing. It will just take some practice I guess. Overall this is a great quality scarf that is beautiful and very fashionable.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced."
4.0,It arrived in a timely manner. The product matched the pictures perfectly. Priced nicely. I plan to purchase 3 or 4 more shirts from this seller. Great experience
4.0,I liked the watch band look but was by far not leather which I was a little disappointed
4.0,Love the dress but larger than expected
4.0,These are ok but was expecting better quality.
4.0,A lot bigger than expected but nice so far
4.0,I've tried several and now I'm happy. Fits comfortably and breathing holes make a difference by not fogging up sunglasses as much. The velcro adjustment in back allows it to ride where you want it. Finally a mask that protects the back of your neck beyond the shirt line! I only wish it covered the bridge of the nose for complete protection. Still the best out of 6 masks that I've tried.
4.0,i have had one slip off when cleaning my glasses but never when im wearing them. ill add an update if that ever happens. nice easy slip on.
4.0,The metal piece could have been a bit bigger
4.0,"Incredibly cute! Top fit perfect, but bottoms were way too big. Wish I could get a different size for each. Also, color is more brown than expected."
4.0,Love this. I use it on all the vacations I take where I have to fly. It keeps everything together in ine plac eand has lots of pockets.
4.0,I purchased this watch band but it’s just ok. I look nice but it get dirty easy
4.0,RECOMMENDED<br />The included pouch is a nice idea but with its long length any tool you put in it will either be top heavy and topple over when worn or repeated smach the user in the thigh. It needs a bottom anchor point.<br />Well constructed. Nice material.
4.0,These are too cute but they were too little for me
4.0,nice but not good size
4.0,Nice item. True to size with quality bandage material.
4.0,Very cute and flattering :)
4.0,"Love this sweater! It is a bit wide but it's long enough and drops off the shoulders nicely. I am 5'6, 150lbs and I ordered a size Large."
4.0,"These work well and are sturdy.  I only wish the lenses were not plastic, because I don't see as sharply through plastic."
4.0,"I bought these for my mom. She really likes them. Many of the reviews here complain they don't have the fur on the bottom so they aren't as warm, we are from California so this is actually a positive for us. We can wear them longer! The look and feel was great. They must have been stored funny so there was some matting and funny spots on the shoes when I got them but the shoe brush I had took care of it. Keep in mind these are &#34;big kid&#34; shoes so if you are adult they might fit a little odd. For my mom they were very tight, she took them to a shoe repair and have them stretched a little and they now fit perfect! She loves them."
4.0,"I like these shorts because they're soft and they fit around my booty pretty well.  However, I call them my &#34;EllieMae shorts&#34; because they are short.  I doubt I'll be wearing these outside much but they're comfy for lounging around the house on lazy days or as a cover up for swim suit bottoms.  They are made of 55% cotton and 45% modal.  What is &#34;modal&#34; you ask?  It is  is a type of rayon, a semi-synthetic cellulose fiber made by spinning reconstituted cellulose, in this case often from beech trees. Modal is used alone or with other fibers (often cotton or spandex) in clothing and household items such as pajamas, underwear, bathrobes, towels, and bedsheets.  So, they shouldn't shrink much, if any.  I like the drawstring around the waist - just like sweat pants have. These are similar to cut off sweat pants but lighter and prettier.  And these have a cute pocket on the backside."
4.0,"I love the cute pup; however, within one week the Coach tag fell off.  The ring is tight and almost wouldn't fit my key.  I had to use a screwdriver to hold it open enough to squeeze the key on."
4.0,"Bought this item for my husband and he loves it; the only problem with it is that it’s not well put together, as far as where it glows, it’s sloppily put together in those areas . Another problem is that it doesn’t glow bright, but it’s still a nice piece and my husband still enjoys it ."
4.0,Shirt was perfect but pants were a little on the big size but they still fit... overall im pretty impressed... except for the bow.... im not fond of the bow...
4.0,Greeat! But it wasn’t burgendy like it was shown there it was red but regardless good & comfortable
4.0,"Very nice product. Al though is not real leather, it has a very nice feel to the touch, and a cool look!"
4.0,"More warmth than i expected, the brand is a great one for its price ."
4.0,Fit nice. Was disappointed the zipper served no purpose and lacked at least a pocket.
4.0,"My wife's choice of non-belted, Chenille bath robes with cotton (even a blend) are hard to find, and this one seems very nice. The robe was a gift and the opinions here are both of ours, although I haven't actually tried it on.<br />Good features: bright, vivid color; 3/4 length sleeves so they aren't always in the way; snaps rather than a belt; the robe is generously sized. There are concealed side-seam pockets for that pack of Lucky Strikes. The internet shopping experience was painless, and the shipping was fast.<br />Not so good: 70% cotton 30% polyester works, but 100% cotton would have been great.<br />The robe is an import."
4.0,"I love this hat but it is a bit pricey for an infant, but his daddy loves hockey."
4.0,Edgy and cool glasses but it arrived with a scratch on it and air bubbles on the sides.. Other than that these are awesome.
4.0,A little smaller than ones I got at Kmart year’s ago .
4.0,pretty awesome bag!
4.0,Got these for my 4.5 year old daughter and she loves them. In the picture they looked more comfortable.. the brown around the toe is a very hard material and the bottoms are also a hard material and no traction. These are definitely more of a dress boot than a play boot.
4.0,I ordered this for my 10 year old daughter who was going through a pirates of the Caribbean phase. The medallion looks like the one in the movie except much bigger than we were expecting. Good enough for costumes and play.
4.0,Bought them to use for night wear but can still go outside and water my garden in them as well. Are great
4.0,"Good quality material and looks good under clothes. However, the sizing runs very small. I am 5’10”, 150 pounds and would usually order a size medium. The medium was very small on me, I would need at least a large."
4.0,"Color, fabric, and fit are exactly as stated.  A tad too long as usual.  But very pretty.  Recommend for the price.  Diane St. John"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:e0333e0a1e8a8a06eb4f3cc9b0859040]] I love this thing! I could definitely pack it lighter by taking travel sizes of everything, but it fits more than I expected! I only had to get another small bag for my medications and one for my makeup!"
4.0,"This is the perfect summer dress! It's light and airy. I love the style and will be ordering more!! Wear to work, work, or out to dinner. Love it!!"
4.0,"I bought this ring and just like my other ring wore it and the stone fell out, but I ended up finding the stone."
4.0,Cool Bane Mask! Was a X-mas present for Brother in law!
4.0,Ok look
4.0,"This belt is exactly what I needed. Looked great with my black dress! The only negative is it would loosen itself every so often, but not too much to be a real issue."
4.0,"Great comfort, while working out,...good product brought couple more"
4.0,"good quality - doesn't hold all of my cards, phone, but will make due."
4.0,"Super cute but mine had a tiny hole on the inside of one leg, luckily my mom knows how to sew so she fixed it for me. Will probably order more!"
4.0,Absolutely love this dress. It's very comfortable and and purchasing another from the company. The fabric is very soft and comfortable and I would absolutely recommend
4.0,"Very nice quality. Have to my daughters and niece. They’ve all worn it, and liked it a lot."
4.0,"I love these glasses, exactly what I expected 😊"
4.0,"I bought these for my soon-to-be 5 year-old granddaughter so I have not given them to her as yet. That being said, they are quite cute and seem to be good quality, posts seem very sturdy. Very impressed! Could not give a 5-star as I have not given to her."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:4d1c06ec3a51e1651f862b6a65006a86]] It does a good job, but it's kind of annoying. It also takes a couple minutes to put on (these are the only reasons it's not five stars). So, if you are a quick dresser, this might not be for you. The elastic is pretty strong, which is great for the shirt, but it kind of made the legs feel like they needed to lift up in order to relieve the pulling sensation (you can get used to it, but it feels weird at first). It is totally worth it if you're having problems with your shirt staying tucked in.<br /><br />The quality was excellent. The clamps were very strong and non-aggressive toward the clothing. At first, it was a little scary to attempt lifting the arms because we were testing out the clamps. However, after a few times of doing it gently, we quickly realized that the clamps were incredibly strong and we now have no problem worrying about if they will detach.<br /><br />When we purchased the product, we originally thought they were suspenders due to our lack of knowledge about the existence of this type of product and how they were labeled. The packaging was wonderful. Nothing to complain about. They had a simple, but clear, instructional picture. It arrived in a very timely manner and we are very satisfied with this product.<br /><br />We received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"These are beautiful and a great price, but they are sooooo big! wish they were a little smaller. It fits my 2 year old thou :)"
4.0,Cheap quality but it was funny for the recieving party. From what i hear they enjoyed the laughs! Would buy again
4.0,"I really like this case, i have had it for about a year but the sides are clear and they start to get brownish. Not very protective but it is very pretty and fits perfectly."
4.0,Looks to be off white in pictures but is very white. Still very cute though
4.0,"This really isn't the best for large breasts. I could definitely see a smaller A-C sized cups to wear this, but for my Ds, it wasn't holding them up too well. Very sticky though, could see lots of uses out of them."
4.0,"I sized these perfectly! I am a 29 waist and got a 28 (Lucky’s run large). All my other Lucky Lolita boot cut jeans are 27s and stretchy. These are NOT stretchy so keep that in mind. They are great though and a nice light wash. I also ordered L (long) because I like to wear heeled boots with them and they are perfect length for that (I am 5’6”). They do hit the floor if I’m not wearing shoes. Only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because they feel fairly thin in the butt area, but we will see how long they last. Making that area thinner does provide more comfort but makes me nervous as that is where I tend to get holes in jeans. Overall great value, as Amazon has priced these at half or maybe less than half the price of what you’d normally pay for this brand."
4.0,"LOVE this shirt, it is feminine and unique.  It hides my &#34;curvy&#34; ahem, stomach, but accentuates my upper assets.  It's comfortable enough to wear while lounging at home, yet nice enough to go out in it.  Great for curvy girls!"
4.0,Perfect for boots that are a little tight along the calf for thick socks!
4.0,"Great low budget sunglasses I can use while playing with my kids, doing physical activity that could damage my glasses and i wouldn't case as much as an expensive pair of sunglasses.  They are polarized and work just as good as any other polarized sunglasses."
4.0,"The fit is nice and the quality is decent. I ordered two colors, one in black and one in red. The black shirt's fabric is very brittle and uncomfortably stiff, but the red shirt seems to be made of a regular cotton/polyester blend that is quite soft. Overall, the shirt is nice and I would buy it again in other colors."
4.0,"I wore this for graduate auditions and I got so many complements! Not to long, perfect length and didn’t wrinkle easily.  I wore them with cute character shoes. I know they would look good with a Latin shoe. Just make sure when you wear this when sitting down to really have good posture. It can make you look bigger sitting down than you actually are. But perfect standing up."
4.0,as expected. nice fabric.
4.0,"I loved them when I saw them, the only problem is that it is a little bigger than normal, I am 9 but in these shoes it should be 8.5. I received many compliments for my new shoes, even to go to the office in jeans and jacket"
4.0,"The earing doesnt always fit together that well if you dont push it in right, otherwise its really cute"
4.0,I ordered the orange in a medium thinking I could wear it into the fall with leggings and what not. What I received was a neon orange tie dye that fit my 4’10” 135 lb body nicely. It is a little clingy around my tummy but not so much to make me self-conscious. The sewing looks decent and I’ve got my fingers crossed on what I’m about to do. Will update my review if things change.
4.0,"Niece loved it, so I'm Gr8!"
4.0,"This is such a great idea.  My husband is constantly making fun of me for making a mess when we eat out.  I like the designs of these so it is not as embarrassing to pull out if you are out to eat.  This is super long, and I would prefer it to be a little shorter but that is ok.  It is also a little tight around my neck, but works."
4.0,Got them as a gift for someone so haven't tried them out but they're made solid and came in a nice box and bag.
4.0,The waist band is a little smaller than I expected. But the skirt is comfortable and looks great.
4.0,"Just returned from two weeks an a tropical island, and I put these on every morning. I could beach hop and jump in the ocean on a whim, then shop or dine on land and do that all day without changing or relying on a coverup. Super versatile, comfortable, high quality/strong material, dried quick and just really really easy. They also never felt too hot (temps were highs in the 80s, lows in the 70s). Also LOVE the pockets, which added to their versatility. (Although be sure to get in the habit of checking pockets BEFORE you jump in the ocean.) I'm 47 and found the waist and length to not be too dowdy while covering trouble spots and being appropriate for shops, restaurants. Granted, 9"" is a bit on the ""mom-jean"" spectrum for shorts, but nobody wants to see my thighs. Another plus on the 9"" is it offered coverage when sitting--so no itchy Jeep car seat material or back-thigh prints from outdoor chairs."
4.0,I loved pretty much everything about this shirt. It's cozy & just like the original. The only thing that I didn't care for was that the sleeves were slightly baggy on my arms. It isn't as taut as I'd like. But it'd be great for someone with bigger arm muscles 😉
4.0,Pretty but just a little large in the chest for me.
4.0,"I'll preface this by saying I am a big Outdoor Research fan.  From their softshells, to mittens, I've liked everything I've bought from them.  Good quality, good fit (i.e. not boxy), and lifetime guarantee all add up to repeat purchases on my part.<br /><br />My wife and I both have this hat.  She has two of them in Medium, and I wear a Large.  I've got a big head, and I was surprised at how big the Large is.  I ordered both a L and XL and returned the XL as it looked like I was a little kid wearing my father's hat.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the biggest plus is how easy it is to carry this thing and how versatile it is.  I always toss it in my backpack while hiking, I wear it while running errands on Sundays, and I always toss it in my back when travelling.  I tend to avoid it in the dead of summer as the synthetic material, while thin, doesn't breathe all that well.  Conversely, it's not warm enough to wear as a hat in the winter.  Its really best suited for fall and spring.<br /><br />I've found myself using it most when I travel.  Its light and packs easy, and doesn't look goofy.  My wife brought one to Peru and basically lived in it for 2 weeks through all kinds of weather.  It blocks the sun (as it's got an spf30 rating), fit the part of a backpacker, and was easily stowable in any just about any pocket.<br /><br />To recap:<br />Pros - Versatility, looks good, brim doesn't look like it folds while wearing it (it stays rouned), dries quickly, ideal for travel.<br /><br />Cons - Its really only suited for the shoulder seasons.  If you want a warm weather version, opt for the one with the little mesh vent panels on the sides.  Same hat, just better breathability."
4.0,She loved it.  Wish it would have had threads on both sides since it does tend to flip over.
4.0,"I really like this product, the rubber is thick and is water proof which a plus for my very active 5 year boy.  It is very difficult to get it through the shoe holes without some needle nose pliers, but other than that the end result to me was worth it."
4.0,I like it. The hat expands to allow for a bun.
4.0,Not really designed for wide calfs.
4.0,"hard to clasp together, so i rarely remove it which is annoying, but it's decent. The long chain easily breaks too, lucky i have small wrists and was able to connect the sturdier ends together."
4.0,Huge. Ordered 12 mo and probably a 2T size. Had to return but looked good
4.0,Nice shirt with very good construction. The color is much darker than the picture but I’m keeping it.
4.0,"5'3, 125 pounds, slim build. Ordered a Small and it fits lovely. I would however like to point out the zipper doesn't come all the way down so it's a little snug to get in. It's beautiful colors!"
4.0,"Decent skirt,  good price,  cheaper than Walmart.  Has lots of blue that doesn't show in the pic.  Short in front long in back.  It's cute"
4.0,Very cool pack for someone that breaks or loses their sunglasses often. lol
4.0,I liked that it wasn’t tight around the elastic bindings and that it fit as expected.  I tried a skort that had amazing padding and was a bit disappointed this didn’t have a little more as my bum was still a bit sore as a newbie cyclist for a week.  Contemplating whether to keep this as I decided ultimately to get a cushioned seat and not worry about cleaning clothes.  I like the idea of having it if ever I borrow or rent a bike away from home.
4.0,Not sheer. Flattering. Well made. Only wore once so far. Need long torso for best fit. Mine is shorter but still looks good. Doesn’t fit well if super curvy
4.0,"Kinda small, like a 6 month bib at most. But a super cute gift. Vibrant color matched a coordinating outfit well."
4.0,very stylish and comfortable.  I think they will be much more comfortable after a few washings
4.0,cute when I am a bad mood I wear it people stay away
4.0,Love them. They do however run large. I got M and could have easily worn a small.
4.0,"The dress is really pretty. It's obviously not high quality, but looks good for more casual wear. I generally wear XS (5'6, 130, 32D) I ordered this in a small, it's a little tight through arms and chest, but not enough to return."
4.0,"Fits well, fabric is a little rough in texture, but sizing worked out nicely. I’m a 32x32 and the length is good even after a few washes. Color faded a touch, but gives it a lightly worn look which is fine with me."
4.0,Got this for an everyday watch. The light is the only problem because it's not as bright as we expect but over all it's still a good watch.
4.0,"I took a risk and bought this outfit although there was only a single one-star rating and I'm glad I did. I'd been watching a similar outfit for almost double the price, so I decided to give it a shot. This little outfit was exactly what I wanted. The fit was perfect. The size wasn't included in the listing, so I thought well, if it doesn't fit, I'll just return it. This was the final piece to my vacay wardrobe, and now I'm all set and I'll be super cute on vacation!"
4.0,Nice water shoes for toddler. I don't expect these to stay in good enough shape to hand down to little brother but they are a good purchase for the price. The sole inserts will not stay in no matter how hard we try.
4.0,"I ordered two of these tops, one white and one black. Ordered small and it was too small. But my daughter-in-law said she doesn't want to show her stomach off, that she'd feel undressed, so this is not a top for her."
4.0,I love these sandles. I have a brown pair I bought last year. I just highly recommend going up a size. Normally wear an 8.5 but the 10 fits perfectly.
4.0,"Each time I wear this top, I receive compliments.  It is quite pretty, and very flattering to the figure.  The only reason I've given it four stars instead of five is due to the lace on the sleeves not being properly sewn down.  I've had to secure the lace at intervals with tiny, hidden stitches.  After reading the reviews, I ordered a size larger than normal.  I am quite pleased with the fit....accents the waist, long enough to cover your backside, and a lovely neckline.  Best feature is the lace-covered sleeves....feminine, elegant, and classy!  I wear this top with leggings or jeans, but I've also worn it with a skirt."
4.0,Nice dress trust to size..I’m 5’5 165 38C fits comfortably..ankle length..
4.0,"The packaging is pretty and giftable. I wish the chain was longer, it fits like a choker, Lol. As for the look it's REALLY gold but the jewelry is nice and appears to be good quality. So I just ordered the silver set as well in hopes it'll be a better look for me."
4.0,This is a great swimsuit for those who love to turn heads. The fit is good and shows off the assets .
4.0,"This is very comfortable bra. It looks a little complicated and if you aren't paying attention, you can stick an arm through the wrong hole. :)<br /><br />Apart from that, though, I really like it. It comes with removable padding, so if you don't like the fake cups, you can take them out. I am small chested so this provides enough support for running, but it advertises medium support and I doubt if you are a C cup or more that you could do vigorous exercise with lots of jumping or bouncing comfortably.  But mainly I use this for golf and yoga. It works great for both.  The large fits well (I'm 5'6"" and 160 pounds and generally wear 36 B). It's not too tight, but keeps everything in place as needed. It has a cool look to it for wearing as a stand alone top for exercising. I really like that there is only one seam on the elastic band and the manufacturers wisely chose to put the bumpy, scratchy part of the seam on the outside (i.e. not against the skin, where it would rub and be uncomfortable.)  Not sure why other clothing manufacturers don't do that, except that it might look weird.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this sports bra."
4.0,Bought for daughters they all like them
4.0,"I must say this bag has brought me lots of compliments. No one seems to have it. Its unique and i love the design but it is a little cheaply made for the price. Otherwise its a nice addition to your hand bags, and i hate carrying purses so as you can see this one was an exception. I just had to have it!!!!"
4.0,"The dress arrived within 2 days as a prime shipment.I think I like it so far, once I press it out I can likely make it work. I purchased a medium. I just got to figure out how to tie it; the straps are on either side of the dress. I looked at the reviews and pictures but didn't see a design among the reviews like the dress I purchased."
4.0,"The kimono is pretty at first glance. It's very sheer and feels a little bit like a bathrobe or negligee. It will serve the purpose as a thin layer, very useful for this summer. Anything I wear underneath it is visible, so I will have to carefully pair it. It is fairly short, beware that if you're a tall person. I am only 5 ft tall and it comes to the middle of my hips. I'm surprised about that. It fits like a larger medium, in that it'll just meet across my hips, but I am heavy. I normally wear 16/18 or 18/20. For what it is, a loose opened peice, the medium will be fine. The material feels kind of slick, not textured as I would expect for crepe. I will keep it, and get some wear out of it this summer. I don't know if I would buy it again, but maybe in a pattern.I don't like the look of my upper arms, so it will be a good piece to cover those up and not feel like I'm wearing a sweater. I am very pleased it got here in 2 days!"
4.0,"I unfortunately returned this dress, but because of my own personal preference and not because of the actual product. If fit a little big on my stomach and the ruffles at the bottom had me convinced I looked two times larger. The top part and sleeves are really cute and flattering and the shade of green is absolutely beautiful. It’s a great dress material wise, just wish I would have been able to keep it."
4.0,Very pretty and the chain is very shiny. Cute and dainty but chain fits more like a choker and less like a necklace
4.0,"These straps are well worth the money, but I wish they were made so that you could tighten them more. I have the strap adjusted to the tightest possible setting and it is just barely snug enough to hold my goggles in place."
4.0,"Very comfortable, high quality athletic shorts with medium-weight poly blend material, a well-made wide waistband, and nice, deep front pockets. Appropriate sizing and length--not ridiculously baggy as some shorts in this style can be. I'm not in love with the bright yellow pockets, but those are easily covered up with a t-shirt. My only complaint was the drawstring, which was too short for waistband size and partially hidden inside the waistband on one side. (I had to grab a pair of long-handled tweezers and fish the end out through the slit on that side.) I may just replace the drawstring with a somewhat longer cord on my own. Otherwise, these would rate 5 stars for sure."
4.0,"Runs very small.  I am 122 lbs. 5'4 and wear a medium Junior normally.  I bought this in XL and it fits snug.  I like the material and the stretch, it's long enough (I would prefer shorter actually).  The sleeves are a little shorter then they look in the photo otherwise a nice top for a good price."
4.0,Such a beautiful royal blue color! Fits well but the bottoms definitely aren’t cheeky at all
4.0,The dress fits perfectly to my daughter
4.0,"The bag is nice and spacious, with a lot of good pockets.  However, the color is really red, not the wine color pictured."
4.0,"The belts are very cute plus there are 3 to a pack. I understand now what other people mentioned in reviews. The buckle clasp is a little awkward. There’s 1 hook on each side of belt: 1 goes over & 1 goes under so if you man handle it & force it in, it can break. May be a little tricky. The flowers are adorable, band is 2.5” in height so not one of the wide stretchy belts if that’s what you are looking for. Synthetic faux leather behind flower but matches flower exactly. Looks great with skirts. I would give it 5 stars if not for the clasp & would have loved the band a bit taller but other than that, pleased."
4.0,Love love these boots. The only reason 8m not giving it a 5 star is because I went with the size recommendation and their still about 1/2 size too big. I wear 2 pair thick socks it's all good. I normally wear a 7. Bought a 6.5 could have bought a 6<br /><br />Other than that I love these boots!!!
4.0,"This dress is comfortable, fits great, and has hidden pockets. I am still trying to determine whether or not I love the shoulder pads but it cleans very nicely."
4.0,These are decent.  I understand that these aren't big name brand quality.  You shouldn't expect that.  All I wanted was to get a nice looking pair of decent quality shades for my son when he plays baseball.  I got that with this pair.  I don't need a $50 pair of glasses for a kid to wear and throw around during his games.
4.0,"The dress is pretty, the reason I give it 4 stars is that the material is not so good and look like sleep wearing<br />And I will recommend to the people who are in small and medium size"
4.0,"I am 5'4&#34; and 110 lbs. It definitely fits smaller than I had expected - the sleeves do not go all the way down to my wrists and it sits right at the waistline - but I still like the way it looks! It is also made of a slick, stretchy material (like active wear) so keep that in mind!"
4.0,"The only reason I don't give this item 5 stars is the color. In the ad the material appeared to be brown and black. When I received them, they were more gold and black. Still nice, just not what I expected. The quality was very good."
4.0,Fabric thinner than expected.
4.0,Love these… Elastic little tight at the top.
4.0,Overall I like these shirts and am pleased with my purchase. They show sweat more than I expected and have more compression than I thought but after returning my medium and getting a large I am happy.
4.0,Title sums it up
4.0,"These are a little snug with thick socks on so I wish I had bought a 9 instead of my usual 8.5, but they're exactly as expected. Not super great quality but the price makes it worth it. Tread on the bottom is a little slippery."
4.0,"I liked the fabric, but it was too long for my taste.  I will still wear it, but wish it were shorter.  Although, in the picture it does look long so it was my own fault.  Still, a nice shirt."
4.0,A bit heavier than expected. It has a mess lining so it doesn't fold up as small as I was hoping.
4.0,"Gave this as a gift and they were thrilled. They are a huge Stranger Things fan and also a very big fan of puns, so this shirt was fantastic for them.  The material was also very soft and comfortable."
4.0,Super cute and comfortable slightly different than the pic but all and all I like them I ordered an xl I sized up just to be safe and honestly worked out perfect  also washed before I wore they smell weird! I am 5’6 180lbs thick bottom half and I wear size 11 usually just to get an idea 🤗
4.0,"I really like the style detail of these toddler sandals.  The back strap is somewhat weak, however, and constantly slipped under her heel even though I mistakenly ordered 5/6 a size too small."
4.0,I am a 36E.  I ordered a 36E and it was way too tight in the band size.  Probably should've ordered a 38DDD.
4.0,"2nd pair right size now, comfortable. First pair lots of problems to return"
4.0,"Cute! Not exactly what I was looking for, I was hoping they would look a little different, but they were worth the low price."
4.0,The material is soft and thick. Wish the snaps were made of something other than plastic.
4.0,Nice but heavy.
4.0,"Bought this for my husband so he see the time better.  Watch is of good quality, keeps good time, and love the chain. The only thing that would make this perfect, be able to read it when you open it without turning it around.  Otherwise, I would recommend to other for the price and quality of product.  Thank you."
4.0,The straps keep falling off !
4.0,Very Happy with this top.
4.0,Es muy bello lo único es que es un poco grande .
4.0,Darling but runs super super small!
4.0,"Boy howdy, this give one a great butt.  Do like it and will wear to gym with a looong top."
4.0,"Hi,<br />The dress is beautiful and fit"
4.0,I really wanted to love this suit.  Fit well and was figure flattering however the straps and waist band are very scratchy and the side seams of the mesh are sewn with black thread on beige/gold mesh - very noticeable.  I'm returning.
4.0,"Bad picture, sorry. Smaller than I expected but that’s my fault for not looking at the size. If you do not want it the small do not get the smaller size. But very cute and very durable. Stays in my nose perfectly. my skin reacts super weirdly with some metals and this one didn’t. Great product."
4.0,"I like the retro vibe and feel of this watch. Its light and you can tell its been engineered to fit the most important features in it. There is an alarm, calendar, and stopwatch. My one complaint is I thought the face would be a little bit bigger. Ah well, still gonna use it for the gym and around the jobsite."
4.0,"Fits 5'3"" 111-lb frame"
4.0,"The top stone sticks out quite a bit more than I'm used to, so I might just not wear it regularly.  All in all, it is cute and I'm satisfied with the purchase."
4.0,"Much darker than it appears in the photo.... in normal bright indoor lighting, it looks perfectly black.  Data says that it's water-resistant to 50 meters, which implies to me that you can dive down as far as about 50 meters without much risk, but the manual that came with it says that it's okay to shower with it, but not to swim or snorkel, so I don't know what's going on there.  Looks very nice, though."
4.0,nice merchandise
4.0,It is a nice watch looks good. The wood face was a little bit darker than what I thought it would be. The band is Big so you will have to adjust it. They give you the tool to do it but it didn't look real easy.
4.0,Seems to stay on ear
4.0,Super cute but the design on arms feels like duct tape. I'll still wear it but hoping that softens after a few more warnings.
4.0,Nice sandals however I was not expecting blisters from such an expensive shoe.  I hope when I wear them again this would not happen :(
4.0,It wasn’t as wide as I thought....... for everyday use
4.0,"Ordered an xs, for reference I’m 5’1 and 110 lbs. they fit as expected and were almost a perfect fit, I only gave 4 stars because the leggings are a bit loose around the ankles. They flare out a bit. Not enough of a reason for me to return. But I do wish they were a form fit throughout the entire length of leg"
4.0,Nice bright color fits a little big mingt size down looks cute
4.0,"love the thick material, but will be sending it back, it is a lot larger than I thought"
4.0,"Ok so it’s overall nice, the balls and spikes are easy to lose, and if you wear it for to long it hurts really bad to take off but it definitely looks cool"
4.0,A little big in the boob area but over is was a nice fit
4.0,"I like the length of this and its great with leggings.  The only drawback was that it had pockets, which were convenient but bulky looking.  In order to not look like &#34;wads&#34; in my shirt, I had to keep smoothing them forward.  I might pop a couple stitches in them to tack them down in the right direction.  Other than that, it was nice and did't shrink with wash.<br /><br />Forgot to mention.  It has a clingy effect to things around you. Picks up lint and hair pretty easily."
4.0,"They're cute, and trail up the ear as expected. My only problem is that the space between the back of the earrings and the ninety degree bend is slightly shorter than the depth of my earlobe, making them uncomfortable after a relatively short time. Not something I anticipated having a problem with."
4.0,I love this top. I went by size guide next to order and was way too big even for a flowy type top.
4.0,"Nice enough work gloves, the fit is a little tight though"
4.0,Very comfortable but may take some getting used to.  Good quality leather but mine came with some glue showing on the side of the strap.  Walked a whole day in it at Universal Studio in Hollywood and didn't experience any pain or discomfort.  I would definitely recommend it.
4.0,You get what you pay for. The masks work fairly well. Not the high quality of some of my other masks but they do the job. I'm glad I got them. Cheap way to add to my collection 😁 I would buy them again 😂
4.0,Nice layering shirt .nice material . I am a small should have ordered a small. Went up a size but should not have. Need to return.
4.0,"These are very nice light weight hiking pants. I think that the cut isn't right for my figure and I need a smaller size. I’m 5’ 7-1/2” 131 lbs. and took my measurements, I could tell that the size chart was wrong. My waste is about 34” and I sure don't take size 16! I am between size 8 and 9. This pair is a 9/10 and too big. Quality of item is excellent though, nice stretchiness to fabric but also feels durable. I wish that they fit better so I could keep them."
4.0,This watch is super light weight. It came very big. It's not a big deal to have links removed but prepare yourself that it will most likely be big.
4.0,Great product. Hard to go to the bathroom. Slightly smaller than normal size.
4.0,"Very pretty stone, and I love the metal wrapped around it. The size is about perfect so it doesn't feel heavy like some can and was actually bigger than expected. I'm not a huge fan of the necklace part, but I was never sure about it and will replace it with something I do like, but the quality is decent for a fabric necklace in case whomever reads this likes it."
4.0,Goid fit
4.0,The color fades easily but it is a really fashionable and comfortable product.
4.0,"Well I liked the style but the material it wasn't the one I was looking for,I like cotton material."
4.0,Great for the price/purpose as costume jewelry.
4.0,"UNACOO Loose fiting stretch crew-neck tee is made of 95% cotton and 5% polyster and this crew neck tshirts are great for toddlers. The fabric is light weighted, stretchy and nice. Stitiching on the tshirts is good."
4.0,"The dress is very nice and flattering, true to size. The only problem with it is its very thin fabric and translucent, you have to wear a good slip underneath it. Def recommend it"
4.0,"The choker is very cute. The only drawback is that the clasp is a little stiff. If you have longer or thinner nails, the clasp may break your nail the first few times if you're not careful. Otherwise, it's great and very comfortable."
4.0,"Decent masks , the colors are very bright and look really cool in the complete dark. Downside; can’t see when wearing the because the lights are so so bright . And when turned on the battery pack makes a high pitching sound which is very annoying."
4.0,"Everything about the product is great except for the length, it’s too short."
4.0,"They got bigger the longer I wore them, white ones didn't do this"
4.0,Great for Monster Jam for my young son!
4.0,I really like this outfit it's cute and comfortable. The fit is just fine. I'm happy with my choice.
4.0,I am pleased with the quality and the fit of these gloves.  I was a little disappointed that there was no product<br />inside so when removing them hands are sweaty.
4.0,Beautiful bracelet/watch. Good value for the money.
4.0,Although this is a simpler one - it is still good quality and does the job - Thanks!
4.0,"I don't like the material as well as other dresses I have purchased from Amazon.  It looks ok, but not as nice as the picture.  The fit is fine.  I am keeping it."
4.0,"Not sure of durability with thinness, but so far (2 uses of each) so good."
4.0,"Very natural, hand-made, casual looking bracelet. Easy to put on but even at its tightest it's a bit loose on my wrist. May be suitable for a guy's wrist. Very summery, laid-back look. It's nice."
4.0,"This watch does everything that it's advertised to do. As a visually impaired senior the easily readable face is a blessing; and the ""talking time"" is great. BUT, it's very large and thick and takes some getting used to. The worst feature is the sheet of instructions [a MUST read!] which is printed in such a small font that seniors and the visually impaired , at whom this device is targeted, can't read them! A magnifying glass and a lot of patience are required to figure out the nuances of this timepiece."
4.0,Good product and lightweight with very quick shipping.  Arrived as advertised.
4.0,"I bought the light brown and though it does not look like real leather (finish needs some texture to lose the vinyl appearnace) it does the intended job. I bouth this to replace taking hadbag and laptop bag to work. I can fit a 14 inch laptop, pocket book/purse, files, cellphone and lipstick etc with ease. It would have been good to have an outside pocket for celphone, keys etc."
4.0,"The sports bra fits very well,  he pants however are quite small."
4.0,"I really like this bag, its a great size and i love the different compartments even for a smaller bag. I didn't give it 5 starts because it came with a scuff on the top that i just cannot get off. I'm not picky and will likely mark it up myself so i'm keeping it!"
4.0,"This tank is cute and has loads of stretch, but the sides are super big which makes my chest (34GG) look like I'm trying to be on Baywatch 😅 I'm going to wear it just at home."
4.0,Finally masks for Covid made in USA.  Fit well.
4.0,Not really purple as stated but ok
4.0,Ok ordered the large/extra large size and they fit perfectly. Material is a bit thin but for around the house they’re great!
4.0,some what bigger but great skirt. love the colors
4.0,"This is a basic trucker style hat (mesh backing with plastic size adjuster on the back).  But....wait for it...covered in black sequins and it has tiny ears/ poofs on the top.  The sequins cover the front of the bill and front half of the hat.  The back is a black open mesh.  The underside of the bill is in a beautiful pink color.  Also, the threading on the back is in pink.  Fits adult heads no problem.  Only issue is the sequins are heavy duty so this hat isn't fun to touch.  It's super cute and the ears / poofs are a bit smaller then I personally would want but I wear this hat all the time."
4.0,They are great for wearing with onsies as you don't have to take them off to change your little one like you do with pants. I thought they would be way to big for my little girls legs and they are a little bit but not as much as I thought and ido love the concept.  Pretty sure they will grow into them in no time at all (3 months right now)
4.0,The material is a little stiffer than I thought and you have to IRON it.But it fits good!!
4.0,"These are great socks!  I love the feel and fit.  I thought they were going to be black and red with white polka dots, but they are a bit more beige dots than white.  If you are looking for black, red and white socks, don’t buy these.  If the color does matter, buy them!"
4.0,"The material was not as nice as I thought it would be but honestly this dress was so amazing and the look was very nice and that’s all that really matters. It flowed just right and came to my mid thigh and the tie around my waist made my waist look tiny. The chest part was a little loose for me but if you like a little cleavage this would be a great dress.  For reference I’m 5’6, 32 C, and like a 4 US and got the small which says 0-2 but more like 2-4 US to be honest."
4.0,"These socks fit excellent on the calves (they end just below the knee).  They do not shift or fall while wearing.  They are nice in the winter, adding extra warmth & help reduce muscle spasms thanks to the compression.  There are a few things I don't like though.  I wear a size 7 sneaker.  The foot part of the sock is a tad too big, so they don't provide any support to my feet, my main desire on the foot is arch support/compression which I see is in the sock, but simply isn't small/tight enough for my feet.  There is cushioning added to the top of the foot/ankle area but the back of the heel needs something more.  I'm not blistering, but it isn't as comfortable as other running socks.  The seam in the toes rubbed on my left foot which became uncomfortable over time.  I have a problem with my left foot & the seam in nearly every pair of socks, so the issue might be the shape of my foot rather than the fault of the sock so I'm not knocking down the rating for it.  Overall I do like the socks.  They are a bit of a struggle to get on & off but the extra support & warmth is worth it.  I just wish they fit my foot as well as they fit my calf."
4.0,Time will tell how all works out.
4.0,Pretty close to what I wanted
4.0,"For $10, this is a decent watchband. The inner lining feels like suede leather, but I’m pretty sure the outer, “alligator” part is plastic.  Either way, for $10 I wouldn’t expect more."
4.0,"Boyfriend wears a 9.5 got him a 10 he says it’s still too small, he said the lining is comfortable and the sole of the shoe is sturdy."
4.0,"A little see-through, but shapewear beneath seems to help that!"
4.0,It was like the picture
4.0,"Overall good quality jeans made of a comfortable, stretchable material. I docked a star because they are incredibly high waisted, definitely more so than I expected. The waist reaches my belly button. I'm 5'2&#34;, 124lbs and a size small was a good fit (other than high waist). Thankfully I went by the lettered sized because the size S is more comparable to a US 4 than US 6. I am a US 2/4 and these are a bit roomy, so if they were size 6 they'd be falling off."
4.0,I ordered my usual size M in black. The stitching looks cheaply made however the dress Fits fine. Even though the straps and front buttons are a bit loose overall the dress looks cute for the price under $10.
4.0,"This product is very cute, however it runs small. I needed to go up a size."
4.0,Very cute!!! But not gold like the picture.
4.0,"Love the suit but it was way too large.  Must admit I ordered a size up because of the miracle suit fit, but I should have ordered one size down.  They did not have my size to get a better size, but they were great with customer service.  Recommend because of their customer service.  The suit itself was well made and quality material."
4.0,I suppose it works to a degree. It helps with my gynecomastia but could be tighter around the sides and belly area. I do like that it's breathable and comfortable to wear.
4.0,Its good item very good but the size litle larger than my size —
4.0,Comfy... not too thick. Price was good. fits my calves easily.
4.0,Compact.  A lot of compartments which is taking a while to get used to but works well for my needs.
4.0,"Great style, great quality, however I wish I could mix and select separately the size of the top and bottom."
4.0,It feel and looks good.
4.0,It was just as pictured and suits the purpose
4.0,A little too small but good enough
4.0,They are adequate.  The price is the most attractive benefit. I am a little concern about the holding their elasticity after washing.
4.0,"The kiss lock could be tighter....it opens on its own frequently.  Although,  I do love Lux De Ville purses, they are a bit pricey."
4.0,Despite being slightly baggy they still kept my legs warm
4.0,"I bought the pants based on their size chart, and it was a little loose on me on the waist and legs. I’m 5’3 and it was long for me so keep that in mind if you’re short like me. It has a 1 inch elastic band at the waist which keeps twisting whenever i work out. I like the cloth of the leggings very comfortable. It’s just the size and the waist band that i didn’t like.<br /><br />Update:<br />Changed stars from 3-4. After posting my review, their team was kind enough to send me 2 medium sizes. It fit better, and the length was better. However i really find the thin waist garter/band uncomfortable because it makes is roll down when I bend. But the quality of the fabric is comfy and not see thru. If you want a pair of comfy leggings give it a try. But if you’re going to workout and do lots of big movements, i wouldn’t recommend it. Kudos to the customer service though for reaching out to me and sending me a new pair!"
4.0,"Absolutely love them! I bought two pair and want to buy more. They are super soft and they look amazing. They are thinner and have a lot more compression than my other leggings so I was worried about them ripping. However, they are squat proof and are wonderful! I felt so great in them."
4.0,Fits but small for an extra large
4.0,"Very flattering. It’s obvioisly cheaply made, but well done. Nice material. The second layer under the first layer, is shorter than the top...and you can see through it...kind of weird but it’s not ugly. Elastic waste band. If you have big boobs, might come out the side...but over all I love!!!"
4.0,Bought to use as part of this year’s Halloween Costume. Did test run shortly after receiving. Tended to fall off during first hour of testing. Trying more pressure on closing did not improve staying power & was potentially like getting an actual piercing.
4.0,Stretchy so good for any size. Love the assorted colors and quantity. You can choose to wear all of them or use for anklets. Overall a good product for the price. Not sure how it will do for weight loss since it stretches but ima still wear mines to see if I notice a difference.
4.0,me encanta 🥰 las todos sus productos
4.0,Super cute but very tight.
4.0,It was just the right size - not to big or small. I replaced the chain because I wanted it to hang a bit lower. Nice display and variety of coloration.  I thought it was a great value.
4.0,"Fit as expected. Sorta light weight but cozy inside. Great weight for the cool spring air or cooler nights in the summer but not thick enough to keep warm with out layers underneath for much cooler weather. Over all, it's nice and I'll keep it."
4.0,"The bracelet was fine, however I was disappointed that a description of the beads didn't come with it. This was a gift for my granddaughter and I would have liked her to have the information about the bracelet in the box."
4.0,"I bought a net shopping back like this in France many years ago and loved it and have since lost it. I was hoping to find one of a similar size and quality. The netting on this back is slightly thinner than I had hoped, making it feel overall very light. It is a smaller tote but expands well - I have carried home vegetables, a cereal box, of a gallon of almond milk and a loaf of bread with this bag before. It was packed to the brim but did the job. The price is a bit steep considering the size and quality of the netting, but these are hard to find elsewhere (at least around here), so I will take what I can get."
4.0,Dress is great but the belt it came with seems too small for the size dress I ordered.
4.0,"When i gave this for a gift to a friend, he loved it. He loves tech stuff and unique things so yea. If you were excpeting it to be metal like its not"
4.0,"color not as pictured, was more of a coral color"
4.0,"This is made of a almost silky, stretchy material. Similar to my workout leggings. Which means it is clingy. It is in Asian sizing so size up. I am usually a medium in American shirts and ordered the XL. It is slightly loose but still hangs unflatteringly on my belly. I am quite short so the length was actually longer than I'd like. The quality seems to be good. Came sooner than the estimated shipping date. If I can lose the post baby belly, I will like this shirt a lot. But it does show every flaw."
4.0,This necklace has good weight. It is heavy. Looks amazing.. Got plenty of compliments.
4.0,"Form fitting, perfect for hour glass shape"
4.0,"4 Stars because of the poor packaging. First look, I was so disappointed and thought the sunglasses were going to look real cheap based on what I could see through the horrible packaging. But, to my surprise, with what I paid for these Celine replicas, I'm getting the biggest bang for my buck and I'm very pleased!"
4.0,My daughter was so happy when I gave her the boots.  She put them on right away.  They are comfortable and good for the price.  I got myself the women's size and she was happy that we both match.  She feels like a big girl.
4.0,Metal clasp that attaches to Fitbit  will hopefully last longer than the usual band that breaks every few months.
4.0,"Nice shoe overall. Dirt still gets in. Somewhat more difficult to clean than crocs due to texture on sole. Buying daughter new shoes now, and I ordered crocs instead. Partially because she can put the crocs on herself, but also partially because I feel like I had to clean these every night. Cleaning takes either a scrub brush or super high water pressure. It was kind of a pain."
4.0,"Very dainty so not to my liking but does its job and holds my pendant in place. But wouldnt buy again, would go with a thicker chain. Very pretty tho!"
4.0,My son loves it. He is a bigger than usual 10 year old and it fits nicely.<br />It feels sturdy and looks great.
4.0,Bonitas 👍🏼
4.0,"It's hard to find a formidable belt for work.  This navy belt has a clean look, can be adjustable by cutting off the buckle end, and supports my Otterbox phone belt clip."
4.0,Really supportive nursing bras. Latch is easy to unhook and hook back with one hand and 2 fingers and I love the bright pink one. They come with a pad that you can leave in or take out. They also come with an extender for each bra. I ordered a medium and in would say they fit true to size as well.
4.0,"Went a size up like most reviews said to and glad I did as it was still short length wise, couldn’t tuck it in (though I do have a long torso). It would be 5 star otherwise."
4.0,does what it needs to
4.0,I liked them because they are warm but they are not long enough.
4.0,Nice but too large for me
4.0,"It's a nice leather wallet.  The pockets for the bills are a bit deep for US bills.  It has a change pocket which I don''t use so it adds a bit od extra thickness to the wallet.  Nicely made, nice leather."
4.0,Great quality; odd shape
4.0,"I bought this for golf and I have to say I like it much more than I thought I would. Only reason I took off one star, I am always a medium and I bought a medium and it fit a tad tight, but not uncomfortably so. I think because of the &quot;tummy control&quot; it fits a bit snug. If this doesn't bother you, buy your usual size. If a snug fit isn't what you want, go up one size. I love the material, it is very comfortable to wear."
4.0,Shirt ran a little small for an xl
4.0,Love the sun blocking power of these glasses. They block the sun on the sides so much better than other sunglasses. It’s my second pair. They do scratch very easily.
4.0,"Feel great, reason for 4 stars one has a click hoping it will stop."
4.0,"I would order 2 sizes up! Looks great, but high waters when you sit down"
4.0,like the style but fits like extra small.
4.0,Very sweet earrings. Love owls.
4.0,"I love these glasses! They work great! Everything I expected! If something was to happen to them, I would definitely order another pair! I would recommend them to anyone!"
4.0,Not meant to be worn for more than 2 hours.  The weight of the mask starts to hurt the nose after awhile.  The quality was extremely nice.  The mask doesn't look cheap and is better than anything you can get at a local Halloween store.
4.0,"These are detailed and beautiful earrings. I especially like the fact that there are two pieces that hang down and feel like bells. However, they are much smaller than the image shows. So they are delicate rather than stunning."
4.0,"The bag is convenient, well made, and seems like it will be quite durable.  Note that the dimensions are OVERALL, and do not refer to the pockets.  I can't even get a Nook (first generation) in any of the pockets."
4.0,Cute huggie earrings with a little sparkle.  Ordered 10/31 and delivered 11/16.
4.0,"This makes any outfit works for St Pat's. I'm tired of trying to find a green shirt or sweater every year. In keeping with the price, this is not a fine silk scarf, but it's perfect for an annual holiday.  I wore it to a St Pat's party and got lots of compliments."
4.0,"Generally comfortable and good quality. I use them for yoga and just wearing around on errands, and haven't tried them doing more rigorous cardio so can't say how they hold up to a lot of sweat. I usually wear a size 12/14 in pants and ordered a size XL. I currently hold too much weight in my belly, but even so, the waistband is a little loose and tends to slide down if there's a lot of movement, but the legs fit well. I think if I were to order another pair that I'd size down to an L."
4.0,Finally got the right one.  Only disappoitment is the band didn't come with replacements pins.:(
4.0,"Finally! A sweater that is an actual sweater. After several returns of products that claim to be sweaters in their description, only to show up as t shirt material. I am so happy with this. Quick delivery. great price. Good quality. Very soft. Not to big just comfortably loose. And the fact that it was accurately described is the best. Hi lo style makes it awesome for wearing with leggings."
4.0,"Pretty good quality. Fitment was a little large but thats ok. The gray is a little on the green side. My son hates shoes but will actually wear these, and the also dry quickly."
4.0,as my daily wearer
4.0,Slightly bigger
4.0,"First the Cons :<br />Way too roomy<br />low arch to no arch<br /><br />PROS:<br />No Shoelaces<br />Soft material<br />very roomy for wide feet<br />great rubber sole<br /><br />When I bought I ordered half size bigger.  These are really roomy, so actual size would be best.  My son loved them so much he said he is going to be wearing these until he becomes an adult (ordering up a size he assured me). These shoes would have been better if the arch would have been a little higher as they seem to be totally flat inside.  Even my son commented on it. Overall, I would buy another pair of these."
4.0,It works fine does what it is supposed to do non stretch
4.0,They're a bit squeaky in the bath but they dont absorb water and dry quickly.
4.0,"This pajama sleep shirt is very, very soft.  It looks exactly as pictured.  I washed and dried it in the normal cycle and it came out a little wrinkled from the dryer but not very much.  I like the style a lot, but would prefer a little higher neckline.  I don't want to accidentally flash anyone if I bend over and am not wearing a bra.  Other than that, it's perfect."
4.0,really cute kinda disapointed i didn't get any white purple or red and almost half of them were blue
4.0,"Yep, my leather had had expanded. That happens over time with leather. This was just the thing. It brought the hat size down a notch and now the hat fits again. The backing might be better served by a hot glue gun or a different adhesive, though I didn't expect a miracle - I just wanted my hat to fit again, and it does."
4.0,"Hard to see with the light in dark spaces, only lights the left side. Strap a little too small, which is great for my small hands. A classic looking watch."
4.0,"I bought this for varicose veins and standing up all day on the job, thought this would help.  My first experience was that it was hard to put on, but it actually fits comfortably, so much so that I think that perhaps it should be even ""squeezier"" and soon you forget you have it on.  I've experimented having it on 4 days straight without showering and just leaving it on.  I guess it reduces the bulging out of the veins/areas that are kind of bad, but the bigger vein problems don't show a really big improvement, so it's certainly not a miracle cure.  Can't tell if it's better for my veins/health since I am pretty symptom free, but I think I'll keep wearing them anyway."
4.0,The top is fantastic and super comfy! The bottoms feel very cheap and a size too small.
4.0,Only problem is I ordered it in 16 in.my bad.ordered another in 20.so will tell about it...it's really nice.buy it
4.0,Beautiful cool like the way it looks represents the samurai well
4.0,Scarf is soft but somewhat thinner (quality wise) than I expected. Not too bad for the price.
4.0,Velcro wears out quickly but the hat fits great
4.0,Cute socks. Good quality and value. One sock had a hole in it. Received new socks immediately upon filling out return for defect notice. Return process convenient; just need to drop off at my nearest Kohl’s and they will process for me.
4.0,Very cute! A little bigger than I expected. But cute.
4.0,Cute. Exactly as pictured. Fits true to size.
4.0,"I was surprised when I received the envelope which contained the 2 SILO Wedding Rings because they just came in a paper envelope with the 2 rings in a small plastic bag.  If you can forget that the rings are a good quality Non Rubber Hypoallergenic Medical Grade Silicone Band 2 Set.  They are perfect for anyone who works hard with their hands or around electrical.  My guy is a avionics tech and can’t wear the metal bands and he did try this for me, but I think because he is so use to not wearing anything at all that he could not get use to wearing these.  I don’t think it is the products fault but his choice, so we gave these to my brother-in-law and he is still wearing one.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and the opinions are my own."
4.0,Its cheap but tenageer lady like it. So for my daughter is ok. I don't expect huge quality for these hucks.
4.0,"Daughter lived it, fabric is a little thin, but cute and comfortable."
4.0,Very pretty. You can size down
4.0,Nice romper. Fit as expected.
4.0,"It is okay and I will wear it, but I could have used a longer version."
4.0,Comfy and warm.... liking it
4.0,PATTERN
4.0,"No more swelling & more effective mileage.  As any compression sock, skills required to put on.  Advise = leave the sock wrong side out ½ way.  Start with toes & ball of foot.  Then unfold sock up calf working your way to the knee."
4.0,Okaaaaaaay...
4.0,They are very comfortable to exercise in the gym but give little support when running.
4.0,"I love this lightweight robe and have bought it for engagement gift boxes I put together. It did arrive with a musty smell to it which was easily solved by washing and steaming, but also not what I look for when ordering new products. It does wrinkle quite easily so if using for photos be sure to bring a steamer. One size fits all is also a plus. -@confettiandmacarons"
4.0,"What's not to like?<br />The kids loves it, and it looks great (excellent for fun photos :) )"
4.0,I mean they’re glass holders so it isn’t complex... but they do fit my regular glasses and you cannot beat the price!
4.0,Cute booties but they run small.  I would definitely recommend to order up a size.
4.0,"I LOVE this suit but it was too big - I probably should have measured properly, but I did not. I am 5'7, 135 lbs, and 34B bra - the medium was too big so I think the small would fit better."
4.0,"I can't comment on fit because i purchased for a gift, but was very pleased with the product. I plan to bling out the sole before giving."
4.0,Very comfortable and exactly the fit and length I was looking for.
4.0,"These are very nice. I haven’t officially worn them out, but the fit is great and the velvet feels lush. It won’t hurt to order a size up."
4.0,"Very cute outfit, however was really really wrinkled when taken out of the package"
4.0,The dress I purchased was very beautiful.  Only complaint was that it was very see through and not appropriate for the wedding I will be attending.
4.0,Why do plus size tope need to show so much boob?!
4.0,Very nice dress the sizing was too small for my daughter
4.0,Very low neckline. I still like it.
4.0,"Bought this for my sister, who is a first time aunt. She loves it. There was some stitching that was off (which is why I gave four stars) but it did not take away from the integrity of the shirt."
4.0,"It's a roomy well put together purse.  The smaller tote is a little smaller than I expected, but the pair is very nice and functional."
4.0,"As other reviewers have said, these ear plugs are definitely more comfortable than the foam disposables and far more convenient than ear muffs. I'm not sure I can tell any significant difference in the &#34;noise cancelling&#34; ability between these and the foam plugs however. I have received these at a discount but without any obligation to post a review. This review, therefore, is completely voluntary. It is also based on my evaluation of the product at its regular price, which in my opinion is a bit higher than I'd be willing to pay."
4.0,"Great dress, the fabric is on the thin side but overall good quality. It even has pockets!"
4.0,"Great quality, dark lenses really shield the sunlight. Only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the bottom of the glasses sit low on my face and touch my cheeks, leaving marks from where they sit. Makes it uncomfortable for long periods of time and I also don’t want them to make my face sag downwards. Plus, there’s this indentation marks when I take them off, so that’s not fun. Otherwise I wear them for short periods of time and they’re super cute."
4.0,Elastic band might be preferred alternative for securing mask; including it would be perfect.
4.0,Super cute but very thick
4.0,I generally wear a small or medium.  This small is so large that I'm giving it to a larger person as a gift.
4.0,Fit well.Do want to roll down tho.
4.0,"I was very pleased when I opened the package. Beautiful, well made, with sexy heart dangle...No rough edges, and depending on type of shoes being worn, can adjust the length. ..Thank you for an affordable piece of S/S jewelry.  The only thing I would like to see is a lobster claw for additional security. ..not a fan of spring rings. The reason  for 4 stars."
4.0,"Love these glasses, but one broke at the lenz. would buy them again."
4.0,I love this jumpsuit. True to size. Washes well.
4.0,Love this matching dresses. Can not wait to wear them both together. Does run a little big is size.
4.0,Gave it as a gift. Good price. Arrived on time.
4.0,A little smaller than anticipated but does the job!
4.0,Thin but cute.
4.0,Not dressy.  Has more of a casual feel versus after-five.
4.0,Look really cute. dont expect expensive materials but still adorable. My daughter wore them as a flower girl.
4.0,I wear a size 4 usually.  I got a size medium and its a bit snug.
4.0,"The sign isn't what I thought it was, it's flimsy and not very big. However, I found a place to make it work in the man cave!"
4.0,"I've bought a lot of pairs of readers for various tasks.  These seem to be a better quality in the lens and the frame.  Appreciate the case.  Arrived inside a very crushed product box inside an envelope.  Fortunately,  they don't look damaged."
4.0,"Got these for my wife.  She was a bit concerned about the slight heel, but said they were comfy after trying them on.  Neither of us noticed the notorious odor.  Note that the laces are strictly decorative; the boots zip on and off."
4.0,Buen diseno
4.0,The dress was thinner than I expected it to be. The color was great and it looked like the picture but the only thing I didn't like was that it was thin. Not see through thin but the layers of clothes beneath it can be seen.
4.0,Very good product for the price but was looking for a cap with less material and thickness
4.0,"A nice, light, casual dress. I have several in different colors, but this brand runs a bit too small."
4.0,good little shallow
4.0,I was impressed with this dress when I pulled it out. It's lovey it matches many colors I have gotten lots of compliments on it. It is beautiful.
4.0,Love love love this dress!!<br />I wore it today.<br />It’s soft and a bit thin but not see through .<br />Perfect around-the-house or beach dress.<br />Great for hot weather
4.0,Cool dress! Just way too big. I'm a 37-28-38 & the one size is so loose that it looks like a maternity dress. I'm going to have a friend take it in & make it a bit shorter too.
4.0,"I’m 5’4”, 175lbs, and 34DD. This dress is amazing everywhere except my bust. It doesn’t quite wrap my boobs as well as I’d like but it’s fun for weddings and what not. Definitely helps me keep my posture straight."
4.0,"The colour is pretty, the material feels nice and it's flattering from the front but the back puffs out a little too much so it looks funny from the side view."
4.0,"These are cute and comfy, but feel a bit small."
4.0,"Just  a little narrow in the fingers, but definitely long enough.  Well made and comfortable overall.  I might try the next larger size next time."
4.0,Mermaid outfit has a great graphic design
4.0,Super cute (pun intended) but definitely ran a little bigger than I had anticipated.  I'm 5'2 and I had to take up the straps by about 2 inches to fall correctly.  The material is really stretchy and I imagine would work great for someone with a bigger chest.  The cut is very flattering and the dress itself was extremely comfortable.  If you think you'll wear this dress more than once than it's most definitely worth the price.
4.0,I'm very pleased with this purchase and appreciate the promptness in delivery.
4.0,"I love this dress. It fits nicely, mostly showing only the curves I like. The only reason I didn’t give it five stars is that it is much more revealing in the cleavage area than I expected, and I ordered it to wear to work."
4.0,"Lightweight, very flattering dress. The yellow is much more golden/ mustard than the photo. Runs small ok the chest. I’m a 36DDD and the large did not fit properly."
4.0,"S-fits well. I'm 5'2&#34; 117lb wear a 32G.  I also tried on the M and I really couldn't see a difference.  Both dresses are above the knee about 2 in front. sides little longer. The M may have been bigger in arm holes because it seemed as if my bra showed more than the S. With my size chest my bra usually wants to show. but for this no big deal cuz'  it does not show alot and I really wanted the dress for just around the house in the summer time.. It's soft, comfy and cozy.  I especially like that it has pockets. I looked at other similar dresses but chose this for the pockets.  It can hold my phone, kleenex-whatever. It's thin- not too thin,"
4.0,The glasses look great.  They are polarized and it works.  They fit OK.  They feel a little flimsy but time will tell how well they hold up.  No issues so far and since they look good and are polarized that is what counts.
4.0,"I like the style, but they are a bit snug, and the material isn't what I would expect for the price."
4.0,"It is much darker is hue compared to the picture matching the top on the model. I had to go to brighter light to realize it was indeed purple and not black.  In addition to the fact that my face is much fuller than the model and with the need to wear a N95 mask under, it could have been a bit fuller. I am sure those with smaller faces will be pleased and according to different preferences some fuller faces may be happy. It is truly unique and came in a timely manner."
4.0,Not great elastic and shear but will work fine for the summer
4.0,"These are a nice pant, however long. I am 5""4, ordered a medium, fit overall is good, but I will get them hemmed at least 3 inches so they hit the ankle as described."
4.0,"If you have a flat tummy and you’re looking for a very casual shirt, this would be great. I bought it looking to conceal my tummy (my trouble area) but I just look pregnant in it. Also I was hoping it would be nice enough for date nights but with the stretchy cottony fabric it looks very casual. It should be noted that the empire waist has elastic around it, it isn’t just a seam. For people like me with sensory issues, that’s a big problem. Overall it’s a cute shirt and the fabric is very soft. True to size and color. I’m 5’7” tall, 180 lbs and got a large in the Royal blue color. I won’t be comfortable wearing it in public until I lose at least 10 lbs of belly fat, but, technically, it fits properly, it’s just my personal I security."
4.0,"They are ok, good quality materials and craftsmanship. Just the size was a bit off wrong for my foot, they ran a little shorter than I expected... In their defense I might have liked them better if I had ordered a size up but I needed them for a trip and didn’t have time to exchange them."
4.0,Pretty and cool glass....
4.0,The slit is in the backish and it's super loose.
4.0,I like it - but it bleeds color unbelievably when you wash it. Just beware not to mix ANYTHING with this when cleaning.
4.0,Color wasn't what I wanted.  Fit nice and everything else but was too bright.
4.0,Not the same color as pictured.
4.0,Helmet is nice. Good fit. Only issue is there are two pieces that keep cominf off on the front by the chin area. Easy to put back in though. So no major complaint.
4.0,"This was such a great find! I loved the look of this ring and the price so I had to buy it. It fits true to size and it complements my bridal set nicely. It did lose a stone within a couple wears but I continue to wear it because it's hardly noticeable. The little knob to the right to me seems a little random - I don't exactly love it because it doesn't contribute anything to the design of the ring. Overall I think it's great! The lines are feminine and I love the leafy, natural aesthetic."
4.0,The dress is beautiful and would’ve given 5 if it didn’t have the chemical smell which is making sick to my stomach.  It’s pretty though
4.0,Bought the ring for my best friend she loves it it’s a little bulky/thick but very good quality looks super expensive but isn’t. All in all I’m happy with what I got
4.0,My princess love it :) and i love her
4.0,these are comfortable but they stretch out a little too much for me so i don't feel any type of compression in my hips or thighs when i wear these
4.0,"Pockets in dresses are the way to a modern woman's heart. I love this dress bc it is sexy and you're fully clothed. The length is perfect, the sleeves fall at just the right length and there is also just enough loose fabric at the bottom to make it flow and sway without making it seem too cutesey. I'd Def order from them again."
4.0,Please with the quality of the scarf
4.0,"It’s very comfortable, but it’s sparkly silver in real life in the places that look white in the photo. Not sending it back because it’s so comfy, but I wouldn’t have bought it if I had known it was sparkly."
4.0,"I like bracelets that have the bolo type latch.  They're so much easier to work with - slip bracelet on and adjust to the size you want with your other hand.  The bracelet is pretty, the infinity sign could be a bit more sparkly but it's still very nice, and the bracelet does not look cheap.  It could be worn with a nice outfit for an evening out."
4.0,Very warm gloves. Only downside is touchscreen doesn’t work and they are on the small side. Order larger than usual. They are great for keeping your hands wsrm
4.0,don't look that safe.
4.0,"Sure wish it was more clear in the posting that is is for ONE shoe.  I would never have paid $17 for shoe laces....thought $8.50 would get the new shoe laces we needed covered. Cool product, listing didn't read very easily."
4.0,"Nice fit, hangs loose but a belt fixed that"
4.0,"As always Amazon did an amazing job and delivered the product on the day the indicated. The watch performed as advertised with the mobile app and the Bluetooth connection. I am a G-shock fan, so I was not disappointed in the quality. I was displeased with two aspects. The watch face is much darker than the pictures indicate. I work the overnight shift as a Paramedic and frequently find myself in low light situations. Also, the band is much thinner than previously owned G-shocks. Unfortunately, this item did not fit my needs and I returned it for a different model."
4.0,"These fit fairly well, but are cheap...as to be expected for sunglasses this price. The lenses have lines in them, just probably because they're made in China. Not bad for fashion sunglasses, just don't expect to be getting any eye protection."
4.0,"My original review critiqued the band for being too small for my wrist (I have large wrist bones).<br /><br />I was contacted by the vendor via comment and they not only informed that there were different lengths, and the specifics about each length, but also offered me a refund for my troubles. I thought this was really cool and I always appreciate good customer service. I didn't read the specifics about band length when I bought mine the first time around, just the width in mm, so in the end it was user error.<br /><br />The band colors were really nice, though. I got the red and blue stripe band and the colors were true to the picture."
4.0,Great outfit. It is not as bad large as LONG. Definetly not for 4'11
4.0,From looks and trying it on I believe it's a pretty good gift. Cheap but made nicely and has a lot of detail.
4.0,"theyre a little heavy and the screw backs are a total pain, but theyre really pretty and i had no other issues."
4.0,"Good looking and attention-grabbing pants, I have gotten several compliments on it. However,one of the back pockets appears to be improperly stitched and so I can't put anything in that pocket."
4.0,It was okay. Different feel to fabric of too than I expected. Cheaper quality.
4.0,Just again not the right size
4.0,"good for fishing easy to dry., quality required to improve."
4.0,"Bought my usual size but kinda runs slightly bigger unlike another of its kind in the same brand which I had to give to my brother in law who is much larger than me. I really like the waffle material, all in all its nice hope its shrinks a little in the washer."
4.0,"These darling shoes run a tad small, so consider going up a 1/2 size for true comfort. The best part about this shoe is that the stretch fabric upper is thick and solid and lined on the inside with leather, so it will not wear out quickly from stretching! Also, the soles are not slick like they look in the picture, but a nice suede that gives them a good grip on sleek floors!"
4.0,"The &#34;teal green&#34; belt is not teal OR green. It is blue (maybe between sky blue and cyan). The leather(ish) piece near the buckle may be a turquoise. But the elastic band is blue.<br /><br />It's a great belt, I just have nothing to wear it with because the color is nothing like I expected 💁💔"
4.0,"they are comfortable, but I can't wear them all day because I need more arch support."
4.0,"I like this dress and I ordered a size small thinking that it would fit perfectly. It's actually a little too big in the waist and bust area for me. Then I checked the sizes again and realized that there was a size x-small that I could have ordered. I don't remember seeing it before, so they might have stocked back up after I ordered, or I need to get my eyes checked. Either way, it is a pretty dress and exactly as pictured."
4.0,Very cute fits my large fit like a medium :/ will not fit a 10. I gave the large to my daughter who is 5’7 and 130 and it fit her perfect
4.0,great gift and was great in person
4.0,The waist is like a 2x instead of xl
4.0,Got lots of compliments !  Beautifully put together. I did notice some blue residue came off it a bit be careful around white stuff
4.0,I haven't seen him wear...lol but baseball season is over.
4.0,Perfect for a wedding we needed to attend. My husband usually wears a 2X but needed a 3x in this. Decent quality - good for the price! Great for a guy that doesn’t need a vest and tie often and doesn’t want to spend a lot. Knocked one star off only because a button came off when we got home that evening. Easy fix for the price but I would’ve been sad if it would’ve came off mid-event.
4.0,"Great poncho!  Warm, nice texture, looks great on!  NOT itchy!!  Collar is large as shown in photo and has buttons.  Buttons however are just for looks, so if you were thinking of adjusting the collar to open it up, that won't work.  You can still work with it but it will be up high."
4.0,"I got my slippers today and they are really nice slippers. They fit great and they seem good quality. The reason I only gave them 4 stars is because, oddly enough, even thought they are advertised as Australian Sheepskin slippers, right on the bag it says MADE IN CHINA. Not cool. They really should be more honest in the advertising, they are not made in Australia. Evidently the sheepskin comes from Australia but the title makes you believe that they are made there.<br /><br />So after wearing these for a while now, I would say I will not be buying them again. They're just ok as far as comfort. My feet still get cold sitting here working at my desk, and they are a bit hard to get on. The top edge is almost rigid, not at all like other sheepskin slippers I've had."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, he likes it a lot and it looks great - leather quality is nice and the stones are classy (I was worried they'd be cheap looking). I will say the picture shows it's a two cord bracelet?  It's actually a three cord bracelet - which I anticipated since the description says so, but they may want to update the photo.<br />That said - I was really disappointed it arrived broken. The leather was detached from the one side of the clip, I had to glue it back inside the clasp before I gave it to my husband. We still like it, and if the glue holds then all is well, but I worry about it coming loose again and falling off. Time will tell! If not for the detached clasp, I'd have given 5 stars. It does look great and I'm impressed and pleased with the quality of all the materials, if not necessarily the assembly."
4.0,My wife is an 8 to 10 dress size us and larger on top 38d and I ordered a large which said us size 14 which would normally be too big but it fit great. Not too thin of fabric and wears well
4.0,"The items are cute and I like that we can adjust them to fit each kids face; four out of 5 grand kids loved it.<br /><br />Therein lies the problem; there were only four masks, not five. I wish I would’ve counted them prior to taking them over to give to the kiddos.<br /><br />If you’re looking for five masks to be in your order, I’m not sure that you will get them."
4.0,"Good value, and they work well in rain & fog. These glasses have great lenses for cutting through the fog & mist that you get on rainy days from other cars & trucks.  They have a strong, black rims which is a look that I like."
4.0,I like this hat and have gotten complements on it a few times. The size could be a bit bigger but maybe its because of the wool and it shrinks some as I don't wear it everyday.
4.0,There is a flaw in the fabric that looks like a fold but is a much lighter shade in the fabric. Very cute I like it
4.0,I love this shirt. It's light and comfortable.
4.0,"To be fair, my 12 year old daughter is tall and a bit developed for her age. She is 5’6” and approximately 130-140lbs. Usually she’s a medium to large so I ordered a large. It was a tight fit. I then ordered an xl but my, wise Anime loving, son told me to get the biggest size. I said XX? Nah, that’ll be too big! He said trust me, then thank me. So I trusted him, canceled the xl and ordered the xxl. A couple days later, I was thanking my son. The xxl fit her perfectly. For that reason I will give this 4 out of 5 stars, the sizes are very off. Otherwise, it’s perfect! Great colors, style and decent quality. They’re happy, I’m happy."
4.0,"I am in love with my packing system for my suitcase. I was able to pack all my outfits ,shoes jewelry ,underwear ,sleepwear ,and swimwear using this system in my suitcase . I still have plenty a room to pack towels my husband’s clothes and both our toiletries"
4.0,"This is so soft, squishy, and smells amazing. It tears easily. I recommend it to people 6 and up. Overall it is great"
4.0,"I wanted to organize things with this product. it holds many items but since there's no protection, it is easy to break or scratch.<br /><br />OK to use. collects some dust from the backpack as well."
4.0,"they look great when on,,just the feel of them,,they feel a bit thin,,over all great for the price"
4.0,"Nice! Really runs small. My husband needs a 40, will have to get another cause its to small. So if you need sick 40 go up to the next level of sizes. Other then that very nice"
4.0,"Nice suit, nice price, arrived as expected."
4.0,♥️❤❤❤❤
4.0,"I saw these recommended on a YouTube channel by Alpha M.  I am a 28-year-old male, 6 foot tall, 175 pounds, with a 34 inch waist.  I tend to prefer tall slim fit shirts and a 32 inch pant height size.  I find a lot of my dress shirts that I wear on a daily basis for work come out of my waist line to easily.  Resorted to not wearing handfuls of my favorite shirts due to this problem.  I started using these if you weeks ago and really like them.  It adds a minute or two to my morning routine but no big deal.  I was much more aware of them on my body the first couple days, but now I hardly noticed when I wear them.  I would recommend these."
4.0,Very cute! Unfortunately two of the pieces were smashed and so I couldn't give five stars.
4.0,"Bought these for my grandson. He's a big boy. But going by what size he's wearing now, these fit fine. He's almost 2, starting potty training and doing great. Loves his big boy underwear."
4.0,"Fit for your chest, it is super snug in the chest area. Bought true size, but there is no give.<br />Fit everywhere else but the chest."
4.0,Thought I was ordering the &#34;Amanda Classic&#34; GV jeans but is a slimming style that is much too small.
4.0,"This is an excellent bracelet, that is very adjustable and will fit smaller woman wrists. The beads look genuine and if not real, but I had a chip on one of mine, so it was it a bit disappointed that it wasn't checked for quality control. Otherwise I had no complaints."
4.0,Bought these as a gag gift stocking filler  for my 21 year old son since the dog chewed up his expensive 'rave gloves' which he uses for his 'light shows' He thinks they are 'cool' :)
4.0,Is not high-quality
4.0,Not as soft as I’d hope. Bought an extra large as suggested by other reviewers (would normally buy a medium) and probably could have gotten away with a size large. Beware: this product is 100% cotton and will shrink when washed.
4.0,"The waistline of the dress does not hit the natural waistline is more empire height.  Be prepared to do a lot of ironing, unless of course you're into the very wrinkled look which I'm not, as the dress comes in a plastic bag extremely wrinkled.  Once ironed, the dress flows beautifully and is very feminine. Time will time how well the dress holds-up.  Should work for a summer wedding."
4.0,Very nice design on the beach towel
4.0,"ok, runs big"
4.0,I don't like the way the hem rolls up way past my waist and I'm always having to pull it back down and unroll it. But I like the color and I will wear it anyway.
4.0,Most of these are pretty cute some just look cheaply made but I got big feet so bigger ankles and these fit just right I do love them.
4.0,"I really like the material, but can't seem to find a tag saying what kind of fabric?"
4.0,So much nicer in person than in the picture! My only regret is not getting a 6 watch winder vs a 4! Love it.
4.0,"Cute, washed it once without drying and where the tag is in the back of the neck threads are already coming apart, i give it two uses."
4.0,The sleeve is too big that's all
4.0,This material is sorta uncomfortable and runs small. Love the look though very nice top
4.0,"I wear a ""D"" bra and from what was described, I thought these would fit a little bit better and be a little bit bigger. Now let me say the fit is not horrible, but when you wear a ""D"" you do not perk up like an ""A"" cup when going braless. So wearing this is like going braless. So with that said, this is the first hurdle you have to get used to when you are my size, the feeling of going braless and being a little droppier than you would normally in a regular bra. They don't fit quite like described. For those of us who are well endowed, they run a little smaller than I would like, but they cover the necessities!  So I give it a 4 out of 5 for size and description of size.<br /><br />The second hurdle is the fact that there are no straps and this is just glued on. I found myself pressing my chest all day. Now that is not to say that they ever (not once) gave up their stickiness. As a matter of fact, I was pleasantly surprised by this since at one point in the evening I started to sweat. I thought for sure I was going to be naked under my white shirt, but they really held up to what they promised!  So I give it a 5 out of 5 for holding up to the challenge of stickiness.<br /><br />The third hurdle is taking it off. OK, so it took some finessing to get them on, they stayed for well over 8 hours, but now I am home and I need to take this thing off. Holy Cow that hurt. YES, I know there is a tiny little, itty bitty spot where you are supposed to put your nipple when you put it on. But for God sakes, I am a ""D"", nursed 2 kids for a year each, and have to pick my boobs up off the ground to get them into my regular bra! So your little quarter size spot to put my nipple is not going to work. So needless to say taking it off hurts! But if you are a tiny A cup and not having to try to finesse you boob into looking like it is not touching your knees, then no problem here, I guess! Either way, even if you do not get the glue part on your nipple it still hurts. But at least you know they are not going to fall off! So for trying to get these things off, I give it a 3.<br /><br />So overall I was not as perky as I would be in a regular bra, but not horrible either. At least nobody noticed including my hubby. It took me the whole night to get used to the feeling of being (like) naked under my clothing. The stickiness really held up even if all night I was checking it. Taking it off is a little bit of a nightmare especially if you are bigger breasted and are finessing the bra to give you a lift when you put it on. I would say I would give this a 4 1/2 if I could. They lose 1/2 star due to the size description and the actual size of the bra.  I definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a braless feel or has a shirt like mine where a strapless bra just would not work, unless you were looking for that ""Hey look at my sexy 10-year-old strapless dingy looking bra everyone!"""
4.0,Good product at a great price a lil over sized so I wear thick socks
4.0,This was a great skirt I used it for a costume party and it worked fine. The material is a bit rough to the touch but it does not irritate skin nor feel rough when wearing. Would recommend.
4.0,Handsome watch! It is very simple and understated yet is an excellent statement piece.
4.0,"I did love the fit of this dress, and it got the job done for the event I needed it for but I am not sure I love it. The material is soft and comfortable but the big flowers are printed on and look pixelated."
4.0,Gorgeous ring! Curious to see how well it holds up to daily wear and will post updates if any issues.
4.0,"I love the dress but it is unforgiving. I am very skinny but because of how thin the material is, it doesn't have any structural value or help to give form to my body. I feel like you see every curve."
4.0,as described...
4.0,I love it but after a while the black the cross side started to come off.
4.0,"I love this dress, the color, the design, the fabric, but I must point out that it is way to big in the chest area.  I wear size small and 34D bra, so I can fill any dress up but in this one, I had to get creative and sew on the sides to get it not hang lose underarms.  The skirt portion of the dress fits just right not super tight, appropriate for work.  Love the slit in the front and the military looking buttons."
4.0,"My kid is 7, muscular, and wears the largest size in these. It's hard for us to find good underwear. This is just okay. I'll be adding a better waistband. The waist is loose but the legs and hips fit fine. I have made underwear for her in the past but I don't have time for that right now and she just went through another growth spurt. The only other underwear that fits her better is under armour women's XS but it's more expensive, snags easily, and is not cotton.  I'm open to other suggestions, parents of athletic kids."
4.0,In the bust area it is a little tight.  But it really is beautiful...
4.0,"These are very low price per glove. Excellent. these gloves are great for pumping gas, picking up dog poop, spraying bleach, etc. I recommend these glove for purposes like that."
4.0,Great length and easily fastens
4.0,"Finally received this from the mail! it took roughly 3 weeks to order it, so just a precaution for those who might need it a little bit earlier (shipped from Israel). Its a bit smaller than I had imagined, but nevertheless super cute. They got the names perfectly, and I ordered the 22 inch chain, which I believe is a great size for the necklace. I am never a big fan of tight necklaces that look like chokers, so if you're like me get the 22'. The only issue I have is it feels kind of cheap, just a little bit. The plates are extremely thin, and I am scared that it bends super easily so fingers crossed its sturdy! The chain also feels quite flimsy, but hey its a great price for what it is! Long story short, happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"The material they’re made of is great. The look of them and the cost are great. However, when you adjust them to make them smaller they don’t stay. They need some kind of lock to keep it in place. It stretches back out to the large size within a few minutes of putting it on a moving around. If you have a bigger wrist these might be ok.<br /><br />Updated review: Customer service reached out to me and replaced my watch bands and stated the one I got was likely defective. This seller goes above and beyond for their customers and I would buy from them again."
4.0,"This was a very well made skirt and was nice looking, it just didn't fit me very well.  I think it runs small."
4.0,Great router- much better coverage and very little dropping.
4.0,I brought this for someone. By the picture I thought I'd receive 3. I know she's going to love it. She would of loved all the colors.
4.0,"I should have known from the picture on my screen that the pink wasn't pink. But what I received is weird. It looks like it was possibly a cream color that had a tinge of pink, but not really. The khaki color looks closer to pink. This is not pink. The pink they show in the picture looks like a pinkish taupe. I was hoping it would be better, but it is worse. Other than that, it is fine. Maybe I can dye it. As for size, I am usually a large, and I got the large, and it is perfect. It even says light pink on the size tag. What they sent is Cream, not even close to pink. I am not Mark, I am his wife."
4.0,They both met my expectations and were delivered reasonably on time. Quality is good.
4.0,"This is a great bracelet. I usually wear my fitbit with a watch, and I find that I cannot do this when I wear it with this bracelet because it is too big. However, it is great for when I have a fancy occasion!"
4.0,Clasped on ..color is a lot lighter than the pictures but have received plenty of compliments. Didn't rate it a 5 because after a couple of weeks the band has loosened up a bit
4.0,[[VIDEOID:39a8b28206e87574d45b9ce51a6c74ea]]
4.0,"Material is different than typical work out pants, but I love them. These could be used as tights, yoga, or normal gym exercise. They are very comfortable and so far have held up well. They are thick (don't see through them like some) and seem to be sturdy. I have worked out in them at least 6 times and washed them with low heat tumble dry. They still look new."
4.0,Was a little too big for my 7 yr old but other than that my son loves it
4.0,"This swimsuit cover up fit as I expected it to and I really like it. The garment itself did not shrink when I washed it, but I did notice that the fringe on the bottom shrunk a little bit. It doesn't hang down as freely and loosely as it did before I washed it."
4.0,Se los compre a mi esposo y le encantaron. El problema es que pensábamos que el lente era más claro y es bastante oscuro. El trabaja en una fábrica y no se los permitieron son excelentes para trabajos al aire libre.
4.0,I LIKE THEM AND OTHER PPL AT THE GYM LIKED THEM
4.0,"My only issue was the bow and flowers are glued to a safety pin and pinned to the dress. Other than that it is beautiful, well made and my 5 year old absolutely loved it. Also, she is five and broke the bow off the glued safety pin in a matter of two hours."
4.0,Very happy with the blouse.
4.0,I love the way it fits took one star off because I wish the material was a tiny bit thicker so u couldn’t see my bra.<br />But I love it! Perfect length I’m 5’6 180 lbs It goes right to my feet
4.0,It’s a little too firm for me.
4.0,Great set of earrings for the price. Like to wear the two smaller ones on my second and third piercings. Not too big or distracting when wearing larger hanging earrings.
4.0,So comfortable but my feet/socks get wet when stepping in a puddle right away.
4.0,These are super warm and feel well made. I know that they will last for a long time. My only complaint is that these run on the large side.
4.0,I've had these shoes for about 10 years and still wear them every week. I work on my feet all day and they still hold up all these years later. I'm only writing this review because I came online to see how much I had bought them for and saw some negative reviews mentioning bad quality. I can absolutely guarantee you that these shoes are great quality and will stay together after lots of use. Sure they don't look brand new but only small bits of the PU Leather on the heels are actually rubbing off. All other seams and threads are fully intact.
4.0,It's soft & comfortable
4.0,These are a nice cowboy boot fot yhe price….  They are not leather…..  but they are comfortable
4.0,Other then being short it fits fine.
4.0,Great pair of active pants for kiddos that run true to size. They're thin so keep that in mind but well made. They are not see through
4.0,"These are identical to the photo. They are super cute. Either they run a little tiny bit large or maybe my daughter has tiny feet, either way they are still cute!"
4.0,"This is a super cute dress. For reference, I'm 5'7, 119 lbs, and my normal size small fits perfectly. I'm kind of torn on this dress because I love how the top half fits, but it's a bit too long. Again, I'm 5'7 with long legs and this covers my knees. I'd love this dress if only it were a few inches shorter. Since it is a bit longer, I think this would be a great dress for taller ladies.<br /><br />I know there are a few sellers on here with similar dresses, so hopefully this helps: I also ordered from Tom's Ware and Herou. The Tom's Ware dress is a slightly thicker material, hits above the knee, and I had to go up a size because the chest was quite fitted. The Herou dress ended up being my favorite length wise, and the material is equivalent to Fensace - lightweight and stretchy. All good dresses for the price, just depends on what fit and look you're going for."
4.0,"The dress itself is beautiful.  I loved the feel of it.  BUT, it runs very small in the bust area.  If you have any size in that area, it's probably not going to fit well."
4.0,Very cute summer cover up. I was looking for something to take on vacation with me that would not be too heavy/look bulky and this is exactly what I needed.
4.0,"I absolutely loved these jeans at first. I still love them only slightly less than the beginning. They do stretch out a bit after wearing so they get a little loose in the knee. I usually wear a 29 or an 11 and I went down a size and got a 9 and they are good! The funky smell goes away after a few washes, they are still one of my &#34;go-to&#34; jeans because they are cute and comfortable!"
4.0,Cute but didn’t last long
4.0,"The dress is perfect to dress up or down. If you are a plus size women who is currently losing weight, this dress is for you. I love how the ruching hides my stomach and hugs my curves. The green looks great with my dark skin."
4.0,"Overall, the shirts fit fine.  They offer sun protection.  Ever so slightly on the small side, but nothing major.  The shirts breath ok.  My one issue is there is no tag or writing to indicate what is front and what is back on the shirt.  That seems really odd to me."
4.0,This watch has all the numbers that are easy to read.  It looks really good and still looks good and working perfectly after 6 months.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
4.0,I like this a lot. The only thing is My baby is 8 months and I bought the 12-18 month size because he is chunkier but i think it runs small since other clothes 12 months are perfect and 18 are a little loose.
4.0,"This is a rich navy blue and cream set that is great for cold days that are also warm enough to be stylish and most importantly, NO RAIN! These gloves aren't insulated so you want to make sure they won't get wet but otherwise they are super cute and this is an affordable set that makes a great gift."
4.0,Great price and a good product.
4.0,"I've switched from using pounds of facial tissue to using washable handkerchiefs. I was particularily looking for informal, soft, cheap white 'kerchiefs. These fit the bill.  A little stiff coming out of the package, but after washing, became soft and gentle on my delicate nose. I like that they are quite thin, light and small - I tuck them into my pocket for hiking, keep some in my purse and my car.  Apparently, I blow my nose a lot!  I've washed mine several times and the hems have not unraveled - not a single one. Handkerchiefs are hard to find and these worked out well for me; in fact, I'm purchasing another packet."
4.0,TOP IS ONE COLOR BOTTOM DIFFERENT COLOR<br />FITS<br />LIKE THE SHORTS STYLE<br />BUT WANT MATCHING
4.0,I was looking for something whimsical for a very young lady in our family and was delighted to find something that was both cute and affordable. These Laura Ashley flats are precisely what I wanted and the price was a great value.
4.0,Very comfortable material ..runs a little big and nice colorful print
4.0,The bottoms are tie - so fit well.  The top was a bit small for the size.  Other than that - it was good thick material and was impressed with the quality of the suit!
4.0,"These pants are very comfy, the only thing I don’t like though is how they are baggie at the bottoms near the ankle. They are very stretchy which I would have done a size smaller since I wanted them for workout pants, but I kept having to pull them up a lot since they were very loose. Nice pants! I’d just order a size smaller!"
4.0,"A bit expensive for what it is, but way better than paying $40 on a pound of cooffe (if you use the pods)."
4.0,"Great bag but when I opened the box, it had a terrible smell. I’ve washed it and left it outside and it still stinks."
4.0,"Question: Do you like Piña Coladas? How about getting caught in the rain?<br /><br />Wear this, and experience an immediate 10%+/-5 increase in your base hip rating.<br /><br />Answer: When you get caught between the moon and New York City, the best that you can do is buy this sweatband.<br /><br />Pair with the ""gardenia"" Fila retro wrist bands and whoa now you're feeling subconsciously compelled to drink Perrier and buy some Blu Blockers. Caution: Frequent use of this product may result in riding a Craigslist 10-speed bike or buying a Karmann Ghia.<br /><br />Learn to play some lead guitar; don't get caught underage in some funky bar... WITHOUT THIS SWEATBAND!!!<br /><br />The terrycloth is a must for me, soaks up all the sweat I can muster while swinging my Wilson T2000. It's snug if you have a large head (mine larger than most for sure) but is still comfy.<br /><br />To summarize: If you will stand in the rain on the corner and watch the people go shuffling downtown, you really should own this."
4.0,"Very happy with the necklace. The quality, style and craftsmanship is excellent."
4.0,"much thinner than I thought... I hate wearing camisoles under shirts, but you kind of need to with this unless you want everyone to see the seams of your bra, every little fold of skin, etc. But it is a pretty purple color and very comfortable!"
4.0,"Very silky material and its hangs nice just the arms a longer than I would like.<br /><br />I ordered a large because I have wider shoulders and my arms are of average length, but they were still a little long. It is very classy looking and well made. I could definitely wear this for many occasions."
4.0,If you order based on the size chart or realize that you need to order up because of the Asian sizing you will love this top. Its kind of a weird material but its very comfortable and looks great. I've had a ton of compliments on this top. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I don't really care for the material but its really no big deal and it is kind of cheaply made you have to watch the seems on the sleeves. I wear it to work so just for the office or to wear out occasionally its great.
4.0,Hat is really nice. The bad part is the delivery time it took.
4.0,"Very cute watch! The only negative is that one of the watch band holders fell off after just a few days. This causes the band to stick out some when fastened. Other than that, the watch works great."
4.0,"The standard mask size really needs to come down; this one is the same as most ""standard adult"" sizes, and it can be made to fit a normal-sized person, but really a good fit for an average adult would be a bit smaller than this. On top of that, and worse, to me, is the unreasonable size of the print. This, sadly, is also true of most ""standard adult"" size masks! They blow up the image too much, so when you wear it, you can see what the image is but it's nowhere near the proportions of a true face. They need to zoom it out a bit, so the mouth would be actual mouth-sized.<br />Still, it's decent quality and a lot of fun to wear, so I just docked one star for the complaints I have, because those complaints are true of all the masks like this that I've bought."
4.0,"Birthday present for my Doctor-loving 14 year old - was larger than I anticipated, but she loves it anyway."
4.0,"We got this to replace my father-in-law's very old, and worn hat."
4.0,"But I do like them. As a 5'5&#34; person, these are WAY too long. I rolled them up, and they are cute,  but it defeats the skinny jean look. The inside of the denim has a &#34;dirty&#34; wash, which isn't very attractive, and unavoidable when you're forced to roll them. Otherwise, they seem of nice quality and are good jeans!"
4.0,"They're cute and aren't causing an allergic reaction which is nice. The metal can be a bit bendy but for the price, it's still a good buy."
4.0,"It's a  nice jacket, but I choose the wrong size."
4.0,"Basic tank top, super useful and in a very good price. Great deal!"
4.0,"Slinky material, I love the design."
4.0,The charms were cute but mixed matched and some hooks were backwards.
4.0,Shorts run z little small
4.0,"They're supposed to be the warmest gloves ever, yet in 30 degrees my hands were cold. They're supposed to allow you you use your phone and I couldn't use it at all. Not that comfortable and barely fit in my pockets. Do not buy these."
4.0,I actually am pretty happy with this caftan.  The only real problem is that I can already tell that the pompoms probably won't make it through a wash cycle.
4.0,"This shirt is very comfortable. It is soft and fits well. However, the color of the shirt is a bit lighter than the dark gray in the picture. And the buttons were light colored, not dark like the picture."
4.0,"It's stretchy material, and does show underwear lines, so you have to be conscious about that. The fit is great, though, and with the stretch, is great for those with a booty!"
4.0,"Beautiful but very silky, it’s hard to keep in hair because of how silky the material is. But other than that I love it!"
4.0,"I purchased these as a gift for my summer campers. They held up to their crazy toddler antics, and they all looked adorable while wearing them!"
4.0,"I'm snapping up as many colors of these as I can find for the right price.  Just a great all around travel and outdoor hat.  So lightweight, breathable and stow-able. My backpack never goes on a hike without on of these caps packed inside!  This is really a five star item but here's the deal why I didn't quite go there:  There is some variation in the sizing, i.e. I ordered two of these in the same size but one had to be returned because it was too large as opposed to the other one that fit.  There is also a noticeable difference in how this model fits from the Radar Storm cap.  The two caps look nearly identical but the fit of the crown is MUCH more shallow on the Storm versions whereas the regular version offers a fuller and deeper crown .  Lastly, as many of the other reviewers stated these run really big.  So to be direct, I don't think there are too many men who can realistically wear the XL unless you have really, really, super large heads.  I learned this from experience by having to return an XL for a L. The L was spot on.<br /><br />I'm not sure if OR is still making these because of the variation in availability and pricing but I'm sure glad I've picked up a few for a fair enough price."
4.0,Super cute but will not last long.
4.0,"This wasn't suppose to arrive until 11-23-15, but here we are 10-19 and I already have it. I order this in an XL and it is true to size. Very comfortable. The only thing that is weird about it, is that the pockets are all they way on the sides, not in the front like most hoodies. It is awkward to put my hands all the way on my sides like that lol. But overall a great hoodie. I was a little concerned at first because of all the negative feedback, but it worked out for me. Happy with it, I will be ordering the white one next."
4.0,"For an inexpensive wig, it is simply amazing and worth the money! However, the straps inside of the wig are like bra straps that makes at times uncomfortable in certain spots. It does come with a wig cap, but my hair is short and it isn't necessary for me. The hair does shed and once you play around with it, it will frizz. I used a flat iron on it and it did straighten but a curling iron does not make it curl. Once you straighten, that's it; that is really my own fault."
4.0,"Comes darker but a good buy, the fabric is nice and looks solid.<br /><br />About a year later they hold up well and bought this for about $5.99 cheaper than stores and easy to find and use.<br /><br />Product update.... 1/25/16 they are still around, glad it wasn't expensive and now when i need it, they are there. Would just buy the basic colors that you can match with multi things... red blue navy black ect no crazy colors like brown green ect."
4.0,"They look nice, the yellow ones look kind of &#34;eh&#34; and they didn't come with proper backs(came with the plastic type you would find on dangles) overall I look forward to wearing them!"
4.0,"Frames are extremely thin, about 1mm, and I'm concerned that they might not be able to hold my lenses in securely.  Will have to check with my optician.  Very high lenses ride well up on face and may contact eyebrows.  Will have to see how these turn out.  Edit:  Optician says 1mm rims no problem, but 53mm large size is too big for -10 lenses.  Will have to drop down to a 49mm.  Lens will definitely contact brow."
4.0,"Worth more than the price, easy to tie & stays the way you left it.😁"
4.0,"Good price. Nice material weight. True fitting.  Liked everything about the sweatshirt jacket, except the pockets weren't stitched together so hand just went straight through the pockets (both) :-(  I guess you get what you pay for."
4.0,Looks and fits as expected. Just extremely thin material.
4.0,"I loved how cute and dainty these hoop earrings were until they weren't able to close anymore. I used to wear them every day including to bed. The silver is very soft and it bends very easily. I figured I would be able to bend them back to a perfect circle but I was wrong. The clasp no longer stays shut the way it should. Great earrings if you wear them every once and a while but other than that, I wouldn't recommend them as every day earrings. I'm honestly kind of sad that I can't get the clasp to close anymore because they are super cute!"
4.0,This is one of the coolest watches I have ever seen and I love it. My only complaint is that it came a bit too small and there were no additional links included to increase the size of the wristband. Other than that this watch is super cool!
4.0,Cute and comfort but not as long as I would like.
4.0,Nice assortment but I ordered 16g and got a mixture or 14g and 16g not a big deal.
4.0,Pretty cool lightweight hoodie. The faux zippers don't make a ton of sense but they look neat. I would definitely recommend this if you are a fisherman/woman. I bought one of each color. I'm not 100% sure how well the fabric will hold up as I'm seeing little balls after washes but I still enjoy wearing it.
4.0,Pretty- BUT I am 5’5 & was expecting pants to be longer than they were. They are almost as high as gouchos or even capris. So they were way higher on the calf than pictures portray them to be
4.0,No complaints satisfied!!!
4.0,It's pretty but the key ring is small for me...
4.0,"This looks very cute on.  However, it doesn't work well for long torsos.  Seems to be decent quality.  We've only washed it a few times and line dry always but haven't had any quality issues yet."
4.0,"I love the dress, however, it seems to run a little small.  I will keep it."
4.0,Classic I used to have one and had to get one for work so I got it again. It’s half the price on amazon than you find at Walmart etc
4.0,"I like the product! The switch doesn't always work as indicated in the instructions. Had to take the device out several times to turn on or turn off,"
4.0,They hold your legs tight.  I hope they last.
4.0,"stocks dont really have a bottom to them which is wear, but love them"
4.0,These are a Christmas present so I hope he likes them
4.0,"The bottle looks good, looks like the picture. My son wanted to buy this with his own money so we ordered it. The bottle came in a silver jewelry box but no satin pouch. He was a little disappointed about that but is happy with the bottle of gold."
4.0,"Although I haven't worn these yet, they seem to be nice gloves.  The thumbs are a little short, but I can still wear them."
4.0,The picture looked like they were tan but when I got them they were a bright green ? And I was surprised to find the palm was open... I'll make them work ...other than the color they're cool.
4.0,"I didn’t see it in person, this was a gift.  It looks really nice online."
4.0,"For the price, they're pretty decent and comfortable bands."
4.0,The first  swim suit I ordered didn't fit to size. I did return and got another size .<br />Four stars because it's some what difficult to adjusted from the back.
4.0,"5'6"", 128 lbs, I bought a medium. It's not quite as form-fitting as the pictures make it look, but it's still a pretty good fit. Length and sleeves are just right, the width is fine, not a tent, just not as slim as I thought it was going to be.  Medium weight fabric, good for cool days but will probably need a layer underneath when it gets colder.  It seems well made for the price."
4.0,"I have owned a few of this Brand.  Here’s my thoughts: Weight-med heavy, not burdensome, solid feel. Size - med large -not gaudy large. Wrist strap wide, heavy and a 1/2” short.  There are double strap holders and the second slides off.  I don’t have large wrists and this would not work for someone w large wrists.  Watch’s looks like it’s $150-  $200.  Overall, solid 7.6."
4.0,Really cute shirt or dress. I pair it with leggings but really enjoy wearing it. It’s really comfortable and shabby chic! It does run slightly bigger I got a large. I should have gotten one size down to make it slightly more flattering but with this said it is really cute!
4.0,"At first I was frustrated with these because I could not unscrew the ball backs on a few of the pieces. I ended up getting creative and using a rubber jar opener to unscrew them. So after I had that bright idea, they have worked out great! I keep them in my second holes and cartilage piercings for weeks at a time and they haven’t caused any irritation. Great quality for the price!"
4.0,Very warm. Not for California weather.
4.0,"I really liked the design and the quality of the dress. I unfortunately had to return it. It was a little large...shockingly. I am a plus size women and that rarely happens. But the problem came in the fit of the bodice. Even had I had a smaller bust the bust was in a funky spot. If I had the dress as tight as it would go, no matter what I tried, I ended up looking like I had a double boob. My flattened real breasts and then the stiff formed dress breast on top of that. Needless to say it was not flattering in the slightest. As those two things are meant to line up together and look natural. No ones breast are that high. They need to redesign that. I gave it four stars because it was beautiful and well made. It just didn't work the way it needed to."
4.0,I bought this dress for a themed bachelorette party. I am 5'3 and 120 lb. and a small was fine for me. The sequence can be a bit itchy. However the dress is very flattering.
4.0,"makes things look very clear.<br />very cool looking glasses overall,<br />I like the side windows,<br />they are pretty cheapo plastic looking unfortunately."
4.0,The shamrock is beautified crafted with all the details of a real four leaf clover. The polished silver gives it a beautiful shine as it lays flat against your skin. It hangs from a very fine leather rope that is double knotted so the leaf does not twist a all around your neck and will captivate many on lookers. Wait also included is a matching pair of earrings with the same detailed carvings. They come with secured background posts so they don't slip off the ear easily. What a classic piece of jewelry you can enjoy daily or for that special holiday.
4.0,"I wanted a nice,soft and easy to clean jacket. I think this is it"
4.0,They were reasonable price and fit both of us.
4.0,The sleeves were a little short but beautiful. Loved the back. Was able to wear normal strapless bra
4.0,Had some picks in the fabric but it is soft and I uses it almost every day as a diver
4.0,comfortable nice looking product
4.0,"Made my toddler wearing his cochlear easier, however not as togjt or form fitting as i would like, very easy for my 2 year old to snatch off, but hey it works. Didnt shrink wen i washed it , kinda wished it did"
4.0,I ordered two of these for my foster grandson. He is slim and wears and 11-12. I ordered the next larger size (kids XL) to account for dryer shrinkage. The items fit well in the larger size. His size would have been too small. Hopefully these do not shrink in wash and dry. But he likes the colors and the feel. Great for school.
4.0,They are as I had expected it. I wear them to work and wore it to surgery
4.0,Really cute and very good quality fabric. Very happy
4.0,"I'm a 36D and went with the Large.  It fits well.  Full coverage good for high impact training.  Feel as though the straps are a little to wide, not a deal breaker just a comfort thing."
4.0,arrived and am so extremely pleased with this anklet!! Its so very cute and feminine.  I put it on immediately and receive several compliments by the end of the day.
4.0,Clingy but it’s what I espected. I will need to wear a “smoothing” type slip to help prevent this a bit.  Not see through .  I wear a size 14 and ordered the XXL. Length is fine for me(5’6”). Yellow is a nice “gold” that will look great with my denim jacket  Wouldn’t buy again but won’t eeturn
4.0,This romper is super cute.  It fits well and it can be dressed down or worn casually.
4.0,"Fit was generic- bit too small in the hips and too loose in the waist (ended up with that weird gap in the back of the jeans that I have to tailor) and the pocket seams make the hips not very flexible when you're walking briskly.  Took kids to the bus stop in 36 degree F/ 3 degree C German fall weather and my legs were numb after about 20 minutes.  I do not recommend for below freezing without thermals.  Nice for fall, but not something I'd wear for winter.  Description forgot to say that they're boot cut jeans as well.  Decent jeans- color is nice in that trendy slight faded manner."
4.0,Very pretty but runs small
4.0,i like this color and feel of the material but in hindsite i wished i had gotten a purse a little deeper and less longer
4.0,Just a bit too loose
4.0,It's large and a good product for the price.
4.0,"Very cute, but the arrow head and feathers are not surgical steel, so they turn green after a while."
4.0,"I get so many compliments with this purse. It is very cute! It doesnt have much room in it, like maybe enough for a lipstick and keys. Its face is different than pictured, and it is a little bit lopsided."
4.0,"Bought these for Disney and while after many wears since Disney some are coming apart, for the price and purpose we needed them for they were great."
4.0,We liked it. Expected product to run small so sized up and they fit great.
4.0,Love this purse!! A little smaller than I thought it would be.. (I love big purses) but that's ok.
4.0,They are very colorful and pretty. My granddaughter loves them. Great little purchase for a 9 year old. They stick easily and for the most part stay on.
4.0,Very nice fascinator and I do recommend to buy.
4.0,A purchase for my wife to add to her Pandora charm bracelet. She loves the charm.
4.0,It’s a quality top. but I ordered rose gold lettering and got just plain gold lettering…very disappointing…
4.0,Very comfy. True to size. I'm a 20 and hit a 2x and they fit perfect. They are really long tho! I'm short so they drag the ground when I walk. The picture makes them look boot cut but the bottoms are huge! Like bell bottoms which I dont really Care for. I'm going to have to hem them and lose like 5 inches of fabric!
4.0,"So far I don't have any dislikes with this watch, I like the magnetic band since I have a small wrist.  Liking the rose gold color and works well."
4.0,"I really like the fit (I ordered medium), however, they do tend to slide down after a couple of hours of wear and give me a saggy crotch. They are not totally not see through and the fabric feels really soft. I would purchase from this brand again. Great value."
4.0,Recently was in a car accident and broke my ankle. This has really helped with the hurting in it. The only complaint is the small is WAY above my knee so I have to fold it down.
4.0,"I ordered a small and medium. I'm 5'5"" and currently 145lbs with athletic build. Both fit just fine and are super sexy. I ended up keeping the medium since it afforded a little more room/stretch and therefore comfort as compared to the small. Sexy dress for a great price."
4.0,Cute with a summer dress
4.0,Really really oversized and the hinges are a little stiff. Does come with a bag and mini screwdriver.
4.0,"Definitely larger than expected for a jegging. My daughter loves the design and they seem to be of good quality, however. I ordered size 8 for my daughter who usually wears size 8 Tall pants, and these are too big for her in the waist and also too long for her. Order down a size or two, or be patient while your kid grows."
4.0,MUCH smaller than expected and no give or stretch to the material. It fits like a SMALL but says it’s a large. Very disappointed with this one. Ordered 3 shirts at once with different sayings on them and the others are much bigger than this one.
4.0,"If you want to wear it against COVID-19, you will need another mask behind it. However, it is not misleading, as it states it is a masquerade mask!"
4.0,I surprisingly liked this more than I thought I would. It is a little boring in the design and the yellow is much more highlighter neon than I expected but it looks nice against tan skin. One of the padding in the chest was a little wrinkled but that what fixed by stretching it out. It fit well and did not give me any sort of wedgie which is a good thing!!!
4.0,"Cute, comfy, and fit well."
4.0,"I really loved this dress and hated to return it, but I am a size 18-20 in a dress and the sleeves were too small.  The rest of the dress fit perfectly.  I thought about having the sleeves removed, but the arm holes were also too small."
4.0,Earring was great for my cosplay. Only downfall was that one of the feathers kept falling off. The appearance of it was exactly as pictured.
4.0,Attractive suit – may not be as supportive as he would like if you are buxom.
4.0,"Very pretty - a little larger than I thought, but that makes it easy to find!"
4.0,"I wish it had more pockets but other than that, really classy and sexy. I love it!"
4.0,"The sock feels great.  It is a bit difficult to get on the foot and up the calf.  Have arthritis in hands/fingers so<br />there is a difficulty in getting sock over foot, then pulling up the calf.  I have ordered a sock puller and<br />that will solve my problem.  This is the best compression sock I have ever worn and would buy again."
4.0,"Excellent value for money, good materials<br />Good finishes"
4.0,Very nice and well made. No complaints
4.0,Shipping was fast. Jacket came in clear plastic ziploc bag within a typical white plastic bag. The zipper is kind of stiff and I may return the jacket for a  12 instead of a 8-10. I usually wear a medium for jackets. It just depends on if you want it to look bigger or more skin tight. I do love the orange on the inside. There's also a little pocket on the inside for a phone or wallet.<br /><br />-- I just tried to order a larger size but it wouldn't ship until a month from now so I may be looking elsewhere. The first jacket has been returned.
4.0,Didn't dislike anything about it
4.0,I have not worn this yet but it looks cute on.
4.0,"I purchased this for a Halloween dalmatian costume, and it was a hit!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Warm<br />Well made<br />Soft<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slightly small - I think these things are popular with middle schoolers and Beiber fans<br />For some reason there is a face on the front and back of the hat.  This actually isn't a big deal."
4.0,Soft material & easy care. Just don't leave it in the dryer
4.0,They are very good for the price.
4.0,I gave these to my friends for Christmas and they are great! So cute and the packaging was outstanding!
4.0,"I love the shape of this beautiful but quirky pendant.  It's really unusual (in a good way) but very elegant and tasteful at the same time.  The cubic zirconia stones are small, but they offer a bit of sparkle that draws the eye to the pendant without being too overwhelming.  This necklace would be suitable to wear to the office or for any special occasion, but I would personally find it a bit too dressy for everyday casual wear.  The length is adjustable and falls at the point where the pendant will show when worn with most tops and blouses, but the chain is rather thin and delicate, so I worry about long-term durability if the necklace is worn frequently.  A nice piece of costume jewelry!"
4.0,Good swimsuit
4.0,It's a great purse. Only issue was I was originally sent the wrong one for mother's day.  I'm grateful I got a replacement fairly quick.
4.0,Loved the shoe but the two sizes smaller in mens trick didn't quite work for my wife.
4.0,"This pair seems to be better than the last pair that kept breaking off at the ear piece , tried super glue with no success,  finally lost the piece on the golf course,  so rating of the last pair is minus two stars ."
4.0,Velcro on straps could be better.
4.0,The cut of the jumper was off. I order XL and it didn't fit the top. Bottom was ok.
4.0,It's a beautiful hat that I am proud to wear showing that I am part of brothers and sisters that served our country and to honor those that gave all. I only gave it 4 stars as I wish the font of &#34;all gave some...some gave all&#34; would have been larger. Those of us who served in Viet Nam will forever be brothers and sisters now and for ever more.
4.0,Fast delivery. Great quality for the price.
4.0,"Pilled the first time I washed it! Also a little large on me but I am short, 5 foot 2."
4.0,Cute shorts that look exactly as they do online.
4.0,"Smaller than appears, somehow makes them even more special.  Very comfortable.  I love them and plan to wear often."
4.0,A little bulky
4.0,The color is beautiful and the words are on perfectly. The size runs small so I suggest getting one size larger if possible.
4.0,"I thought they would be longer. Otherwise,  the quality and design were worth the money."
4.0,Not as thick as higher quality leather bands but adequate enough.  A good way to spice up your watch without spending a lot of money.
4.0,Birthday gift.  It's a Tshirt not Jersey material but My child still really enjoyed it.
4.0,"Fantastic-looking watch, but a little expensive for not having Sapphire glass"
4.0,"I like a purse with a lot of room, this is not TOO big, just right. Lots of individual pockets. Nice purse, would purchase again."
4.0,"Nice band. Appeared as promised.<br />Misses 5 stars for lack of length choices.<br />Garmin bands have S/L and one size. This is almost too short for someone with large wrist.<br />That said, it fits and is comfortable. Very nice product, especially for the cost.<br />I would buy this again.<br />Pins were included and directly fit my Garmin vivomove HR."
4.0,"I'm 5'0 and 120 pounds fits perfect, but skirt is a bit long."
4.0,Bought these for a gift. She loved them!
4.0,they work well for my problem helps control swelling in my feet
4.0,would be better if the end was domed instead of rounded
4.0,I’m 5.3 and it’s pretty long past my knees had to have it hemmed
4.0,A little bit heavy but It is well made and the oval shape is charming.
4.0,They were a nice gift for students for our poetry unit. Very cute.
4.0,"I got this for my daughter to wear over her bathing suit. Last summer, she was at the beach every weekend and I thought this would be nice and lightweight, easy to put on and take off. I machine washed and dried it once, just to see how it held up and it came out perfect! I think the price (about $22) is good, and my daughter recommends this cover up!"
4.0,this is a beautiful shirt but it runs small
4.0,Love the material and the fit was great. Will purchase again
4.0,"A bit too small, would have been better a little bit bigger, but still a pretty set of earrings...."
4.0,Nice bracelet but it broke after a couple weeks.
4.0,"Love these! However, I wish the waist band was a bit more strong. Love the pocket for your phone but the phone weighs heavy and pulls the pants down, a bit."
4.0,Longer than expected but very pretty and comfortable
4.0,"It was a good dress but the open back seems to be too wide, I don't have broad shoulders so it kind of kept falling down.<br />My lats were also too small for it and it would be pretty baggy in that area. But overall it is a beautiful and elegant dress."
4.0,A little bit short in the front.
4.0,Product came with good packaging(Additionally Bubble wrapped). Worth the money except that it feels so light making me feel it is substandard.  Be aware that when temple is folded the tip of temple lands on inner side of the lens which might scratch if not handled properly.<br /><br />One other thing that i observed is the colors when viewing electronic devices/digital board. It is not natural and i could see patterns especially if the screen has white background.
4.0,"Looks just like the picture, shipped quickly"
4.0,I love this bag eventhough the strap has unhooked a couple of times causing the bag to fall and the strap to hit me in the face. Mom always said it hurts to be beautiful.
4.0,"This dress looks cheap when you take it out of the package, but improves greatly once it is on.  I did baste the lace to the liner at the leg slit because the lining will stick out from under when you are walking, sitting, etc. Wore this to a military ball and enjoyed knowing I spent a fraction of what the other ladies did."
4.0,Was a nice watch for price only thing I would change and did change was watch band was very flimsy
4.0,Strap looks nice. Leather is soft. Good quality for the price.
4.0,"My daughter has a high bridge to her foot, so I was surprised that these were still a little loose on top. They were easy to return. The quality was wonderful and the style looks just like in the picture."
4.0,absolutely love love love my ‪#‎idesign‬
4.0,"It's like you wanna like it, but it does run a bit small. The black is a little faded black. I still like it. Wish I had purchased a size up. It's not bad. It'll do its job just fine."
4.0,Comfortable. Wish they were high waist so they don't roll down. 4 star because the ankle area is loose. To make the leggings wearable I had to cut out the tags. Wish the tags were imprinted onto the material.
4.0,Love it. Fit great. Good material.
4.0,Very pretty color. Wish it was a little longer but otherwise I love this top with a blazer for work!
4.0,"Pretty but doesn't fit my ear exactly right. Overall, I'm happy with the ear cuff and plan on wearing it."
4.0,A little small but I was able to stretch it out a bit and then it was perfect.
4.0,I really like this money clip except for one small thing.  The credit card slots are a little to deep making it hard to remove a card.  If they were just a little more shallow you could get a grip on the card and pull it out.<br />Other than that it works great and the clip holds a lot of bills securely.
4.0,"Good quality dress for the price and extremely comfortable.  I bought the white for my bridal shower, it is a thin material so nude color undergarments or spanks would be needed."
4.0,"I got this product at a discount. I bought this for my girlfriend. It's a good product in of itself as the material feels good, but she doesn't particularly like the long sleeves. I think it looks fantastic on her though. Overall, not for her, but a good product nonetheless."
4.0,"Cute, but thin material and a bit see-through."
4.0,These were purchased as gift. Liked by person that received.
4.0,Very durable frames. I put them thru hell for a work party and they held up splendidly. Would definitely recommend and will be buying another pair.
4.0,"BUUUUTTT, my only complaint is that they don’t have pockets. Pockets are everything!!!"
4.0,Beautiful tie.  The zipper feature is nice.  but the tail is too short!  Be ready to tack it down with tape!
4.0,Well made very pretty!
4.0,"I like the size, however they slip off my head, don't like that about them.  Colors are good."
4.0,Nice dress but not what I expected but it's sexy
4.0,"I bought this to wear as a Handmaid for Halloween. I wouldn’t wear otherwise. Material not structured enough, thin and clingy."
4.0,They are neither the most fashionable or most comfortable boots i have ever owned. But a few weeks ago something fell at work and tore right through the leather. But the steel stopped it dead before it broke my toes. So they're alright boots in my book: they work as intended.
4.0,"Almost 5 star leggings! They are so soft and comfy to wear but their size chart is off! I’m 5’6, 28 waist and 34 hips and per their chart a medium should fit me. They are big in the hip area. You can see the extra material in the front and back :*(  My normal size is a small and that’s what I should have ordered. I won’t be able to wear these to the gym as intended but they’ll work for casual wear with a long tunic top or sweater."
4.0,Nice dupatta but I received one with numbers written on one side with red markers.  Had to send it back.
4.0,Nice outfit. Fits like a glove. I have an athletic build...5'9 & 187 lbs. The skirt rises & occasionally have to pull down for a smooth fit.
4.0,I bought them too long but still love them
4.0,"This is a cute dress and flattering fit. I'm 5'5&#34;, 125 lbs and wear a 36C bra. I ordered a medium and it fit fine. The material is light, so it was nice for a warm summer night wedding. It is lined, so you're not able to see your underclothes under it : ) My only complaint was that the seam along the lower part of the zipper somewhat bunches together, and doesn't quite lay flat, so it looked a bit odd."
4.0,First one was too small this one is right will give away the first one
4.0,"Great lens, flimsy feeling frames"
4.0,Nice watch. Built to last. Feels good wearing it.
4.0,"Bought three of this type bra on the actual website years ago. My gray one was on its way out so I needed a new one. This one is not like my others. It's not stretchy at all. Must be a different make? The numbers on the tag don't match to my others either. I prefer the stretchier type better of course, but I love these bras. Especially the thick band. It's a little tight because of the lack of stretch, but I'll deal until it loosens on its own. Cup size is perfect. Please don't stop making these! I can't find any other bra that fits me right and I bought a ton. ...oh execpt one, I also love the retro full coverage which makes a 34C! Awesome tshirt bra!"
4.0,"For a jacket used during my morning walks, it's fine. The sizing feels a bit off -- perfect hit on the shoulder, slightly snug around the torso, sleeves a tad long.<br /><br />I do like this particular heater grey."
4.0,Tried these on at a specialty store & they fit great. These are a tighter fit. Hope I can stretch them out because they are expensive
4.0,Beautiful! Fits perfect
4.0,Like the shorts. Made with heavy material.
4.0,"Fits well but the skirt wasn't all that, cute overall for ypur little one to celebrate the holiday. Bought a 12months size for my 6months old who is 18pounds. Be careful size may run small."
4.0,"Bought this for my husband, he said it was comfortable. Lasted almost 2 years."
4.0,"it's cozy and warm, the sleeves came abit short and not as long as I thought. Love the color"
4.0,"Me gustaría saber si esta correa es de hombre, quiero una parecida para mi galaxy active watch 2"
4.0,"I love it, honestly. Haven't written it in the rain yet, but I work outside rain or shine, so I need a good raincoat. I would give it 5 stars, but there are two problems which are mostly minor.<br /><br />First is that there are no pockets. Kind of a pain, but not a deal breaker. The other issue is the jacket has a left-handed zipper. Which is to say if you unzip it with your right hand you can't pull the free side of the zipper out of the catch with the other hand. So I either have to unzip it left-handed or unzip and then perform an entirely separate action to actually finish opening the jacket.<br /><br />Nothing too major, but it just can't get 5 stars as is"
4.0,Muy bien con la medida
4.0,Finally got the watch together. The band is actually nice and comfortable although it is a little tough to attach the pens.
4.0,My wife loved it it.
4.0,Lovely color and design.  My only criticism is that it needs an internal tie to keep it together due to the material type.  I'll be curious how it looks after being laundered.
4.0,"I got these for a Weird Sisters cosplay. They are very pretty, but the elastic is not very forgiving. I ended up having to cut slits in them and they still cut off the circulation to my hands."
4.0,"I love this necklace, I feel like it goes with so many outfits. It looks more scuffed than super polished but for the price seems to be good quality so far."
4.0,"Really nice comfortable dress. I’ll recommend to buy this, very comfy. I I dye my dress & it’s look so good ."
4.0,"Not a bad little strap! Leather is soft and the strap is comfortable.<br /><br />My one beef with it is the lack of distressing. Mine came out of the package as shiny black leather. Not sure how that could qualify as &#34;distressed&#34; but a quick buff on a scotchbrite pad got it looking closer to the photo. The finish on the leather appears quite nice, so it can definitely take a lot of working before blowing through."
4.0,"No incluye ningún certificado de ser perlas de rio.. o de lo que sea. no hay forma de saber que calidad del producto es, por ahora se ven muy bien fue un obsequio."
4.0,"A little thin and the neckline is really wide, but it's comfortable and cute."
4.0,extremely slim chain. defect on the pearl too. but can't complain considering it's only 50 bucks.
4.0,cute design and looks exactly as pictured
4.0,This watch is perfect!! Very stylish for the money!
4.0,Nice and comfy.  Perfect for winter
4.0,"These are really cute earrings.....They are just REALLY small.....I love to wear fun, but nice earrings during the different hollidays, but these are so small I am going to give them to my grand daughter instead."
4.0,Great bag. Well made and solid. Wish it were a little larger but it holds quite a bit. I would recommend it.
4.0,Very pretty and appears to be made well.  I love the bling it adds to the scarf and it hold the scarf in place.
4.0,Bought this as a birthday gift for my husband who owns a Corvette C6.  He likes it.  Fits perfectly.
4.0,"I love everything about these pants except the elastic waistband. They fit very well everywhere else, but the elastic cut into my waist so badly I ended up cutting it out."
4.0,suits my purposes
4.0,Love this top. Good fabric and fits well
4.0,"Pretty dress, little snug. And would look better on taller person"
4.0,"This dress is beautiful but too long ,not the exact length I want or maybe because I'm short 😂😂5:3ft.....other than that, hello spring , let's rock it and also good for winter"
4.0,I was expecting a better made product for the price. My niece likes this but it washes up terrible. Only reason I’m rating it is due to my niece having liked it so much
4.0,Really cute but way too big...  Maybe that’s the style but wow it was big on me!
4.0,"El producto es de  buena calidad,.bonito y cómodo"
4.0,Got compliments from my friend.
4.0,"Very nice! Soft leather. Color was as pictured. Generous size. I wear a size 8, which fit into their XL category. Package stated 7 1/2-8. Fits more like a generous 8."
4.0,"Super sexy dress. It comes above the knee almost mid thigh.  Although it barely covered my butt and cheeks my husband loved the dress on me. The color was accurate, the fit was okay. The material  is of good quality and not heavy or see through.  I had to readjust the metal 'V' shaped boning in the bust area.  It became bothersome after a while.  Overall I would buy another dress from this vendor."
4.0,"Thin plastic. Perfect, however, for my toddler to slip them on to go play in the yard."
4.0,Fits nice and the material is soft. If you are larger chested like me you may want to go up a size. I am a 36DD and a medium is a little snug in the chest. Perfect to wear on cool summer nights or in the fall.
4.0,"I have a hard time finding a one piece swim suit that I love.  This is a fun piece that is super comfortable and fun because of the adjustable zipper.  I plan to wear it more for water sports for the security it provides! It fits a little tight in length as I have a long torso, but it works!"
4.0,FINALLY FOUND A PAIR OF BLACK DISTRESSED JEANS THAT FIT ME RIGHT
4.0,"The hat itself is great. One star off because of the stupid, crown style that makes you have a Klingon forehead."
4.0,"Happy with quality, color and fit."
4.0,Will definitely wear a belt under my boobs with this dress to give it a little more shape.  If you want it super flowery order up a size.  I ordered my normal size and it skims over my body.
4.0,Very nice it fitted perfectly.
4.0,"The red portion of the pair was perfect for the event my husband and I were going to. The gold mask, though, seemed significantly plain in comparison and we ended up going with something else for him. The red mask though was of great quality and worked perfectly with my costume. I'd only ask that maybe an elastic band versus the tie for keeping the mask on."
4.0,"Very comfortable top, I liked the light colors but still protected from uv rays."
4.0,I love these pants & they are a perfect fit.
4.0,Nice color. Thin
4.0,The fabric is super soft! I'm 5'10 165# and got the plus size. They are a little short in the legs and high in the waist. The overall fit is stretchy and comfortable.
4.0,"The dress is really cute and I got a lot of compliments about it. It's no 100% like the picture, the skirt is kind of shorter but other than that it's a good dress for the price."
4.0,They are cute but fall off very easily if hit by glasses or mask
4.0,Only had this a week so its hard to tell.  Watch seems good so far.  Band really pulls on arm hair.  Other than that...no complaints.
4.0,I love these shoes.  So cute and we get compliments every i time!
4.0,"It’s very poofy, I added buttons and ribbon to it because I accidentally ordered this kinda style rather than ponytail style. Overall nice cap, good material."
4.0,Pretty chokers.
4.0,Cute shoe.  Love the gold wear.
4.0,It looks good and i like it only because there is a plastic flower like thing in the middle of this locket.
4.0,I got this for a really great price and I'm happy with it. The dots are really cute and it fits well. I got a small in black and I'm 36C/30/38. My only complaint is the material is a little thin and see through but I'll wear dark undergarments and it will be fine. This is a cute casual dress
4.0,"I am a medium so I bought small and it was ok but then I bought xtra small and that did the job if you have a problem with your stomach and side bulging then xsmall will tuck everything in just fine, but be aware that you are compressing your diaphragm so if your working out or doing hard work it may not be a good idea to use them under those circumstances, I’m very happy with my results and bought them in 3 different colors"
4.0,Wire was thicker than I thought it would be.
4.0,Love this it is so cute a little big but it is absolutely beautiful
4.0,Purchased two pairs for my sons.  These will work great for the amount of snow we receive in our area.
4.0,"These are very cute. Bought them for a family member who works in a veterinarian's office. The first pair I bought had a bit of a defect (the metal separating one of the ""paw pads"" didn't connect, but I contacted the seller and they said they'll send a replacement at no charge, which I really appreciated."
4.0,cute and comfortable! Pair with your favorite leggings!
4.0,"Love the outfit ...true to size, the shorts gripped my thighs just right, sleeves had me looking like the hulk tho but I know for a FACT that it won’t make it through one wash. The waistband flipped and won’t straighten back, the stitching on the collar is already about to be fraying...BUT if u want to look good just for ONE day... hopefully, prayerfully two... then this is the outfit for you."
4.0,its very delicate and beautiful and recieved before time
4.0,nice slippers for the money
4.0,They were too tight on my calves
4.0,"Nice dress, although fabric is thin, but not see through."
4.0,"beware! theyre very small, so if you have trouble putting in your piercing at a small size, this might be difficult. I wear them to work so my managers dont nag at me. small and simple."
4.0,"Nice warm light sweater.  Careful though,  snags easily because its a loose knit.  Kind of big on me as I ordered XL.  I'm 5'5  155 lbs."
4.0,This is light breathable material I would definitely size up because it was tight on my arms and I am only 5 foot two.<br />My husband being bigger than I am felt it to be very tight. If you wash it definitely air dry after.
4.0,like them a lot and out of the 4 pair only one sock slipped
4.0,Love the dress but don't dry it!
4.0,"You have the option of a safety pin on the back or an elastic strap. I think this is in the event that the strap stops working, you'll have to snip it off. The quality of the product is good, but the plastic clip on the strap is very fragile, so it'll probably break first. And a lot of these ribbons are too ostentatious, but the design of this one is just right. Not too showy and not too plain."
4.0,"I got this in a large and it does fit but it's pretty tight in the lower half. I'm more pear shaped so the top part fits me perfectly but the lower part is small for my body. The material is pretty stretchy, so it does hold me in nicely, but I just don't like tight dresses on my stomach. Personal choice. The fabric is very soft and I like it, and the print is super pretty. I think if I got a size larger I might like it more. But overall it's a pretty dress and someone who wears size 6/8 would probably fit the large just fine. I wear a 10 in pants. But the top part works great for my 34b bust. It's just the perfect amount of room for me, and the arm holes aren't tight either. I've added photos so you can see how it fits me.<br /><br />The tie is separate so you can put that wherever you want. I'd suggest putting it at the smallest part of your waist, that's most flattering :)"
4.0,"The elastic waist is a little snug and I have a pretty small waist. Other than that, I really like them. Not too short so I can wear them to work too."
4.0,"Runs small so order a size up. Nice, lightweight dress in a beautiful royal blue."
4.0,Honestly a nice pair of glasses for the price...
4.0,Very light weight nice for fall
4.0,"This dress fit like a glove. Literally. It did not give or allow for much movement. I could not take a complete walking stride. Other than that, I thought the dress looked great and was very flattering. The color is a nice mint green. Im 5'3 130lbs 34D, 27in waist, 38in hips"
4.0,"It’s a Christmas gift, but it appears to be of high quality!!!"
4.0,"I bought these rings as a temporary wedding set until we have a little more money, and I have to say I am very pleased. I do have a few issues with them, mostly the engagement ring. On one side the band is straight where it connects to the center stone, and the other side is more curved. The center stone is a tiny bit crooked, but no one will really notice unless they are seriously studying it or if I point it out. Other than that the rings are gorgeous. Much nicer than I expected them to be. I have gotten so many compliments and a friend of mine didn't believe that they weren't real. The sizing was right on. Overall I am really happy with these rings and definitely would reccommend them!! :)"
4.0,I got a size medium. Extremely stretchy material. It's adorable & the slit is extremely sexy. The part you wrap around & tie in the picture is a little awkward though but nonetheless an extremely sexy dress to wear out on the town or date night.
4.0,"I Just received this it the mail today and I absolutely love it. Its a thin material yet it is light and warm. I bought this to compliment my polka dot Neff beanie. One side is black with white polka dots and the other side is white with black polka dots so you can reverse it if you would like. Also to the person who didn't like the awkward label on the front of the scarf, it is removable. You can peel it off carefully as it is glued on with light adhesive (likely ironed on). I am only giving this product 4 stars as I was expecting this to come in the mail 5 days ago and I was considering canceling my order as it appeared this hadn't even been shipped out yet. Overall it is super soft and I am glad I ordered it."
4.0,Cool watch that will definitely get some looks and great conversation starter. Only gripe is that the wood can be a bit odd feeling at first and the size of the watch is a bit odd. Would definitely purchase again though just for the uniqueness of the watch
4.0,"I was worried to get this at first because they are not clear about the sizing of the product, but I believe it is in men's sizing since I am typically a women's S/M, and the S for this fits perfectly! Only 4 stars since it came smelling like generic costume, but other than that I love it :)"
4.0,Nice and cool pants. Breathable fit great
4.0,"This is a nice dress, but too sparkling for me. Runs large. I changed for one size down."
4.0,"If you’re been searching for large studs, then you’ve come to the right place. These earrings are quite pretty. They are a tad bit  larger than I expected but I still like them. I got the clear ones and I’m going to get the black ones next. Would recommend."
4.0,A little bigger then I usually like but I also have a tiny nose
4.0,"I love it, it's exactly how I imagined it to be beautiful...."
4.0,"Cute, thought they would be more of an absorbant fabric, very stretchy.  Also thought there would be better tummy control."
4.0,I like this dress and got a bunch of compliments.  The only problem is the top is cut pretty narrow so it shows my bra and spanx underneath
4.0,I received lots of compliments
4.0,Cute outfit but runs a little small
4.0,"I LOVE THESE GLASSES !! I get so many compliments whenever I wear them . They are not the most sturdy so I wouldn't make them my everyday glasses. Nevertheless,  I'm glad I made this purchase."
4.0,They came faster than expected and wrapped so cute I didn’t want to ruin the package. Great quality and indeed no show. The only thing I am not that happy about is I should have gone a smaller size since they stretch. I’m size 8 and purchased M/L and they are a little loose. The product cannot be returned.
4.0,Bought the band to replace rubber dive watch band ....good value
4.0,I like it except the inside isn’t soft as described. Perfect for what I ordered it for which is a family beach trip coming up. For after showers so I don’t have to run from the bathroom to the bedroom with just a towel.
4.0,"fits perfect and is easy to clean  I wish the face could be lighted in the dark,  i have toturn on light to read time"
4.0,"As soon as I took this out of the box, I thought it was beautiful. It fit really well and was comfortable too. My only complaint (and the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the top of the dress is see thru. I got a flesh colored cami that fixed that but I am glad I realized it a few days prior to wearing it for Easter Sunday."
4.0,My baby girl liked it so it’s a win.
4.0,"Very beautiful evening clutch. After the third or fourth use, some of the beads fall off but I have no regrets buying this clutch."
4.0,I really like this cape. It fits well. Comes down to just below my knees. I love the look of it.
4.0,"This was exactly what I was looking for, over time the color has faded and the color over the magnet has scratched off, but overall still looks great."
4.0,Feel a bit scratchy which didn't really surprise me and they don't stretch the same as most fabrics.  They definitely grip the mat which I will need to adjust for.  Rubber heel grips work very well through first yoga session.
4.0,"The quality is better than even some of the big brands, at least as far as comfort, and actually having pockets. There is a liner, which is important for some to note including my self. I really only wish that the XL was large enough for me. Would absolutely be 5* if it came in more sizes."
4.0,"I'm 6ft athletic built and all legs, and this dress fit me well and was surprised by the length. I had to get a bigger size for it to be longer, so it does not fit me well along the waist as I would like it, however, I would still definitely wear this out and about on a casual day."
4.0,Great product only problem I have is the spandex or elastic doesn't shrink back..
4.0,"This shirt is pretty cute, but as other reviewers have noted, it does run big.  I bought a small (5'4&#34;, 140lbs, 34D), and it fit pretty well in the chest, but it is super roomy in the flowy part.  It is pretty and comfortable, but it's not showing off your shape at all.  I subtracted a star because the trim doesn't lay flat around the neckline, which looks a little sloppy."
4.0,These were exactly what I expected.  I haven't used them enough to determine how long they will last when used.  But they seem well made.
4.0,"Absolutely love that you can in 30 seconds change the lens on these to accommodate any condition. You do have to be careful when changing the lens not to apply to mush pressure and break them. The fit is great and form the price, it's a great value!"
4.0,nats are problem hat helps alot
4.0,"Arrived on time, a fair price, and work out very well.  What else could you want?  Worth buying."
4.0,"The size of these bags is similar to the single-use plastic bags used in grocery and big box stores. This is what I wanted, but these bags are not as consistent in quality as I would like.<br /><br />1. The gray bag is made of a thicker fabric than the others. I like the thinner fabric because it takes up less space in my purse.<br />2. On two of the bags, the bias tape was not sewn properly, so I had to get out my sewing machine to fix this. While I had my machine out, I added loops to the top edge of each bag for attaching them to the frames at the store. I also reinforced the stitching at the bottom of each bag.<br />3. The bags have gussets, but the gussets are very small, only about an inch wide.<br />4. The colors are rather somber (except for the red).<br /><br />I wish that someone would make a bag in this size but with bigger gussets and the loop already installed. Another nice addition would be an elastic loop at the bottom of the bag for holding the bag together when rolled up. I find that rolling the bags works better than trying to stuff them back into the little pouches. I use a rubber band, but an attached loop would be so much better.<br /><br />The fabric is currently rather stiff, but I know from experience that the fabric will soften. I’m not sure about the gray bag, though.<br /><br />In summary, if you want a bag similar in size to store bags and don’t mind a couple of minor imperfections, you will like these."
4.0,The first one i received the headlights didn't work.i returned it and ordered another one and it was great.
4.0,"They do what you would expect.... keep water off your feet while riding. Order the next size up if you want some wiggle room/and easier time putting them on and taking them off..... THEY ARE TIGHT. I've yet to ride with them in a complete down pour, so I'm not sure how super water proof they are. So far so good though."
4.0,The skort runs large. Fabric is thin but comfortable.
4.0,"Fits small, wasn’t as big as I was expecting it to be, can’t really wear it on my shoulder like the picture. Soft material, definitely looks nice."
4.0,Super easy to wear! Love the pockets!
4.0,"I love these bras. I’ve found myself wearing them with everything. They have good coverage and comfortable material. The inserts are a bit flimsy though, but I can adjust them through the fabric so that helps."
4.0,Good dress but runs small compared to their linen dresses. It is a more fitted cut.
4.0,"The leather is soft and it has 5 outside pockets and 4 inside pockets. There are 2 handles to choose from, one short and one long. Great purse, a little pricey though."
4.0,These look nice.  I always receive compliments but one pair arrived broken.  The wire had slipped out of the acrylic.  Probably fixable with a drop of good glue.
4.0,The mask fits good on my 6 year old but slightly big on my 3 year old
4.0,This is so comfy and looks absolutely amazing! I’m very satisfied! Will be ordering more.
4.0,granddaughter really liked them.
4.0,Luv it! Its a bracelet and watch in one !
4.0,Bought as a gift I'm sure my friend will love it
4.0,Great product but battery life a bit short
4.0,They were exactly what I wanted. Great as a table decoration. I will buy again
4.0,"I love this dress! I did have to hem 8&#34; off the bottom and had to take the sides in. For a bustier lady (34D), I didn't feel that should have been necessary when I usually wear a Large top, but love the dress regardless. It is see through a little bit, so I don't recommend wearing blue panties underneath :)"
4.0,I Loved this... just a tad to small.<br />got XL and if they would have had a XXL I would have 10 of them  :)
4.0,This was a gift so I don't know exactly what the fit is...It seemed like the proper size when I held it. Again because it was gift this is all what if FELT like. It felt like a solid material. The face is super-cute and doesn't distort when stretched (I stretched it with my hands).
4.0,its a Christmas gift
4.0,Keeps your feet cool.  Good warranty and overall quality.  Somewhat tight.
4.0,"I wear a woman's size 9 1/2-10. Thankfully I ordered these in men's size 11-12, because they fit perfect! They are comfortable and I love that I can wear them outside as well. They look nice, are very soft inside (like a blanket for my feet), and the amount of cushion is just right. I definitely recommend, but order one size up."
4.0,The pendent is very sparkly and is very noticeable despite the size. The pendent itself is smaller than a penny. It is a pretty necklace.
4.0,"True color, fit as expected, but was missing a button. I wasn’t planning on buttoning it anyway."
4.0,Too small but replaced within a day.
4.0,"This bracelet is so versatile.  Wear as  a bracelet, necklace or hair band!!!  I love it's hand made look. Mostly brown beads and a few metal ones in the front.  Now I do have small wrists so, even when tightening it was still a bit loose on me, still wearable though, but not like I like it to fit!  I wrapped it twice around my wrist.  But it worked great as a necklace and a headband accessory.  It does fit my son's wrist perfect, and he liked it too!  It's versatile for either gender.  It's a nice bracelet that came in a zippered case, which was a nice surprise, it has it's own storage.  Nice handmade looking piece of jewelry.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.  This review is based on my own experience and opinion of the product."
4.0,My daughter likes it!!!
4.0,"Good material, loose fitting, good color, wears well, washed well. As good as a name brand items and far better price"
4.0,[[VIDEOID:b4e6d05054ff9bcc1cc1d320722c1b42]] The Short and Simple<br />- Fits as expected<br />- Very cool and cute design<br />- Perfect for your CrossFitter or olympic weightlifter
4.0,I love the fact that the bells ring as I walk. But my charm is starting to turn
4.0,It was really comfortable.
4.0,"First, this dress is extremely flattering and comfortable. I had a slight issue with the top not fitting properly(I am smaller chested) and needed tape to prevent it from opening on me. I bought this dress so that I could nurse while at a wedding and it was very easy. Overall I thought it ran a little big for size. I am normally a medium and I bought a small."
4.0,It was a little short/the flap had to be pinned closed at the bottom cause I wore tights. Will rub off on light colored underclothes. Wore for a wedding. I will wear it again given the opportunity too!
4.0,This dress is very cute.  I went a size up and it is a bit tight but it still looks pretty.  It is not exactly best quality it still manages to dazzle somehow. Loved it.
4.0,Cute dress. Stretchy material.
4.0,Love it! The colors are so bright and it fits perfectly. The top was a little confusing to put on though &#62;.&#60;
4.0,"Looks better than I expected! Needs a camisole, and not as full a skirt as it appears, but overall we were happy with it!"
4.0,Comfortable sandals and have had good compliments on them.
4.0,"I received my silver boots today, waiting on the brown ( charged s&h for one pair & not the other?) Anyway, their cute & my size 7 medium fit pretty good, wish I purchased a 7 1/2 or atleast a wide because my toes feel cramped. I haven't walked around really yet so maybe it'll loosen up some. Price was reasonable & just needed something cute & easy to take my dog for walks."
4.0,Fit most of the kids well
4.0,This are so comfortable and do not cut or bind like a traditional belt. These are the only belts I use with jeans.
4.0,Beautiful but ran big and way to heavy for a summer.
4.0,I really love this dress! The first time I wore it was a very hot day and it was great that it was backless. The asymmetrical pattern is very adorable! I washed it a couple times already and it’s shrink a lot and isn’t as sleek unfortunately. I still think it’s worth the price I paid!
4.0,"I gave this to a girlfriend and she had a hard time getting into it.  Usually this would be her size, but it was a little tight around the waist.  I liked the color and design of the dress."
4.0,A little to short to wear without something under it. But fits great and super soft.
4.0,The dress was ok.... The material was a little thin. But the style and fit was perfect.
4.0,It fit me perfectly and was comfortable material. I think the top wasn’t super flattering on me- it was okay- but no issues with the sizing or quality of the dress.
4.0,Not the most outstanding quality but pretty good.
4.0,"The band is fine and comfortable.  Even though some other reviewers said it needed to be replaced: it doesn't.  But like some different reviewers said of theirs, my watch needs to be wound every morning.  The self-winding feature has flaws -- so I rate the watch a 4 instead of a 5."
4.0,I’d love to give this product a 5 star but the one bracelet was in pieces when I opened the package and beads went flying everywhere. The others are a bit snug to get on my ankle but over all they look cute.
4.0,"Sunglasses and readers they do a good job what there supposed to do, nice and lite too."
4.0,"This outfit is very cute, but it is not a Romper. It is a two piece outfit consisting of a onesie and shorts. The straps/suspenders on the shirts are sewn into the shorts in the back. and the front is adjustable by buttons only. You can not get an exact fit as you would a normal pair of adjustable suspenders. This outfit also comes with a bow tie connected to an elastic band that you put around baby’s neck. The elastic is stretchy enough so as not to be uncomfortable. The onesie looked a little smaller than what I had expected, however it’s made of a very nice stretchy soft material so I can see how baby can grow a bit and still wear it. The straps were too long for my little one when sitting so I just wish that they were more adjustable as they only have two adjustment options by button in the front of the outfit. You definitely can’t beat this price, overall I’m pleased with purchase."
4.0,"I thought this dress was beautiful. It made me look thinner and it was very light and lovely. The cleavage is a little more exposed than I expected, but I didn't hear anyome complaining. ;)"
4.0,Igualito que la foto
4.0,"A little flatter that I would have liked. But made for a wide head with flexible joints. Lenses do not shade the view any color, they are only metallic mirrored on the out side."
4.0,Nice and cushy.  Seems well made.  Not giving five stars since hard to tell how well they will wear.
4.0,Love the fit. Easy to wash. Got xl I weigh 180lbs and I'm 5'5. Perfect!
4.0,"very  good  quality ,  comfortable ."
4.0,"I picked these because I didn’t want a clasp to mess with in putting the watch on each time. This turned out to be a good set for the most part. The color selections are good, although I wish there was a soft pink instead of the peachy pink in it. And maybe a lighter green. But as far as fit, they work just fine - once the band is attached to the watch, just slip it on adjust the watch face color if desired, and GO!"
4.0,Look nice very similar tint to the original but I don’t like how you can see my eyes when I wear it. I loved the original bc you couldn’t see what I was seeing. But other than that which doesn’t affect ANYTHING this Lens is perfect
4.0,"This is a nice set of inexpensive ties. They come nicely boxed. The two I received were nicely made and attractive. One was wider than the other but6 both looked nice. While not what you would see in the C Suite, they are serviceable for dressier occasions like church and date nights. Easy care they are machine washable.  There comes a time when every guy needs a tie. These are affordable, attractive and easy care."
4.0,"Great socks., The sizes tend to run a little loose... or maybe they stretch out.<br />Warm and snuggly for my wife. Got the next size smaller and she's happy"
4.0,It's extremely comfortable and lightweight. I am very hot natured so this should be perfect for colder days where I won't have to wear something so heavy.
4.0,Fits in the corner of my sink perfectly and hold the drain and sponges out of the way.
4.0,"Nice looking. Flower color is a little darker than in the pic.I would recommend to a friend. Came from China, so it took a long time to get it."
4.0,"Great fit, works, used daily since purchased, recommend"
4.0,Good safety vest
4.0,"The Strap broke after several uses, but a great bag nonetheless. I really liked the size and convenience. Washes well in washer."
4.0,I liked this product a lot HOWEVER this is very small!! I wanted to wear it as a head covering and it’s far too small to style that way. NOT A HIJAB
4.0,smelled strange for a few days as it aired out. good quality.
4.0,The watch band was way too short...need longer band...thanks
4.0,It is not one of my favorite ones but it is well made and looks good.
4.0,"I'm 5'4 128lbs 34DD. Purchased this shirt in Large for the fear that anything smaller wouldn't fit in my chest area. It fits very well and the light blue wash is perfect. I just wish it was a few inches longer to completely cover my butt, but other than that, pretty happy with the purchase and the fit."
4.0,"I am older and my knuckles have swollen with arthritis, so the fingers are a bit snug at the joints, but otherwise fit very well and keep my hands warm. Dressy looking for wearing to nights out, concerts, and holiday parties."
4.0,"I love the style. The nosepiece and earpiece are very comfortable and sit nicely on my face.  The case is very nice too.  They claim to be scratch resistant but they scratch just as easily as any other sunglasses.  I scratched mine the first time i dropped them. And the lens popped out.  Also, the polarization makes the inside of the lens blue which is kind of weird"
4.0,"5'8&#34;, 135 lb...bought size small. Taking a star off because it wrinkles far too easily, otherwise, nice shirt."
4.0,"I ordered this with the intention of giving it as a &#34;gag&#34; birthday gift to a friend. We have an ongoing gag that she's a 'crazy cat lady' so I thought this would be perfect, and it was! She actually wears it often and the fabric is nice. I gave 4 stars because the photo gives the impression that this is an infinity scarf, but it is not.<br /><br />The key chain was an added surprise, and I kept that for myself to keep our spare house key on."
4.0,It was perfect for the occasion the only thing is the a pearl did fall off when i received it.  Could be packaged a little better.
4.0,"This wristlet is super cute and big enough to fit all necessities inside. The color is lovely, very vintage looking."
4.0,"Nice handbag, color is true to what it looks like online. Plenty roomy, actually a much bigger purse than I usually carry, but I am getting used to it and like the change. Only criticism, has a strong smell I am hoping will resolve with time..... not the smell of real leather, but also, not the price of the real deal!"
4.0,"Update. The company sent a full refund.<br />Nice top very soft, just didn't like it on me.<br />Also make sure when purchasing something from this company that it says free returns. I tried to return the two blouses I purchased. I bought 2 because I wasn't sure of the size. There reply was it was to expensive to send me a return label and negotiated with me for half there value. So I basically paid for one of the tops and threw money out the window."
4.0,"Very well made but not a big enough pouch. I feel very cramped in them, which makes them uncomfortable."
4.0,"I really like the uniqueness of this top. The reason why I rated it 4 stars is because it took me a little bit to work out how to put it on properly. Also, the material, while soft to the touch, is thin (but not see through) and clingy.  I am 5’5”, 124 lbs and am 34DDD.  I bought a medium and it’s a good fit."
4.0,Looked better on line
4.0,"Not bad. The material is great, the size is great, I’m just a little nervous about how the hearts will hold up after multiple washes."
4.0,Tail Velcro's to belt or belt loop. Stays on really well.
4.0,"If it was even I would give it 5 stars. The back left side lists to the outside. Still works fine, just doesn't look as sharp as it would otherwise. Really helped me organize my necklaces and bracelets."
4.0,I got the dress with the black keyhole top and polka dot skirt. At the time it was only $15 so  the price was well worth it to me. The top and skirt portions are two different materials. The top being a soft tshirt type material and the skirt being a more textured synthetic feeling one.
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars ONLY because there are areas on the mesh that show clear glue. Also a few places on my shoes strings. When tracking my product it showed that it was dropped off in Knoxville, KY....not Knoxville, TN so I nearly had a heart attack making sure I WAS delivered to the right address. And it was! Other than that, I love the color and the fit. And the quick service!!!"
4.0,Just what I needed.  It was roomy and comfortable.  I like it for my lazy days.
4.0,"Perfect! Sure can't beat the price, either."
4.0,"This is very pretty, and catches the light well.  I bought it because it looked familiar to a wire weaving design I used to make.  This is not that.  This is made of a very light metal plated with 925 silver.  There really is not much weight to it, and it feels so light it feels a little cheap, but it is really pretty and looks great!  The clasp is pretty, and a little different, but I don't have faith in it holding if it gets pulled by a kid.  I do love the style and pattern of this bracelet, and I'm planning to wear it often when I have to dress up.  It looks great with both jeans and something dressier, the silver looks great with anything and the pattern while pretty is a little bulky so it can go with anything.  Nice bracelet.<br /><br />I was given a discount in exchange for an honest review.  I was not paid in any way and all opinions are my own."
4.0,The dress was very pretty and I did not need to wear a slip under it. It did seem to run a touch large.
4.0,Rubber sole too heavy for what we needed.
4.0,"So confused. Everything fit a chubby 8 yr old except the sleeves... Lmao it's almost like a manufacturer defect . The sleveles are about 6 inch's pluss too long, as if they were made for slender man's child! But that aside he loved them. They are soft and shipping was a breeze. He just turns each arm into a helicopter now before bed lmao"
4.0,Pricey for a China watch but my wife loves it.
4.0,"These are packaged as underwear and pretty much are. They remind of spanks or super thick panty hose with a control top. That being said they seem to fit and act like spanks, so if your in the market for those, this is an economic alternative. The only reason I took two stars away because they are not for wearing in public by themselves. They are undergarments/ underwear. The crotch especially makes them look that way. I feel if the stitching on the crotch was different and if it had pockets it might look like shorts."
4.0,"It fits perfect, bought it for my Easter Church service.  Can't wait to rock this dress."
4.0,Love the pockets! Great summer dress.
4.0,"Its super cute, im in love. But the strap around my chest is small. Plus the straps themselves are too big. Its bittersweet. Will need an extender and sew up the straps but STILL SO CUTE! Super fast shipping too! Like 4 days!"
4.0,Love it but dose not fit around the arms to tied and it is a XL. Need to make bigger size in pink keeping it never know when it may fit right.
4.0,"I love the colors, navy is my favorite. I absolutely love the placement of the layered fabric. It hides all goodies you don’t want on display in a very flattering way. It faded a smidge when I washed it so, wash it in cold water of course and hang dry for long lasting color. If you want to hide your midsection and want to look cute I recommend this top for sure! It’s a great length also. I love it and it’s girly."
4.0,"I rated this as &#34;Fit as expected&#34; only because the XL did fit as expected.  I would have given it 5 stars say for the size discrepancy but I do love this shirt. I am 5-6 and 145 lbs.typically I wear a medium (ranging 6-8). I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and went 2 sizes larger and bought the XL (it's listed as 4XL on the shirt tag!). It fits perfect! Not a lot of extra room, but very comfortable. It is very soft and the color pink/turquoise is very feminine and pretty. I live in South Fl. so we don't have freezing temps so I don't need to layer a lot. If I did, this would not be the shirt to buy, unless you perhaps went 3 sizes larger. You could probably layer it with a thin material shirt underneath but nothing heavier. That being said, I just bought 2 more. The comfort is a big factor. Even in our warmer winters, we still have cold air conditioning in many establishments, so this shirt is perfect for those conditions too. I just wear a tank top under it.  The length is close to mid thigh but looks great with jeans or even leggings with boots. The fleece lined ones come via Prime so I got it in 2 days with a free return policy. I would recommend this shirt but only via Prime."
4.0,The material is very stretchy.
4.0,"Overall, I like this dress. I kept it, and have worn it to a few wedding showers, and to  church. The bright colors on the pattern are VERY vibrant - like the light blue and pink - so it looks a LITTLE cheap; but not bad. Also, the neckline goes a little lower than I anticipated. It’s very chest-y. Not appropriate for church, that’s for sure. So I wear a cami underneath it. I wish I didn’t have to, but it gets the job done. It’s still cute enough for me to have kept it, so I’d recommend!"
4.0,"Really nice, well made, attractive, but so hard to latch."
4.0,"Good, nice design ! I like it. Thanks"
4.0,"For $44. This is a steal, with a few faults. The adapter needs some work as its slightly loose and not flush with the watch body. Also the clasp could be a little better by making it feel more positive during opening and closing. Other than that, this band makes the Apple Watch feel like a real watch. I previously had the Sport band and while its great for running because it is light. This band adds some heft to it and makes it feel like a luxury / high end watch."
4.0,I love this wallet and how big it is but my zipper broke off somehow and was unable to reattach. I've loved this wallet since I got it just sucks that I know have a broken zipper.
4.0,"Arrived with two stones knocked out, easy fix. Nice for accent jewelry."
4.0,"Bought as a present for another, recipient is very pleased."
4.0,"In love with this set.<br />Looks sturdy, is light as a feather and the color is beautiful. Will report on how well id did after my trip"
4.0,"The polo shirts are good quantity, sizing seemed accurate. I would purchase them again."
4.0,I must say that I buy this one with some other necklaces and this one was the best surprise! It's beautiful and looks more expensive. The quality it's good and now it's my favorite
4.0,"THe sleeves are always going back on my shoulders, there is no way to keep it down to the sides."
4.0,Really nice chain. My Wife LOVES it!
4.0,They could be brighter Red.  In dim light they look black
4.0,"Cheaply made, but it’s only a few dollars anyways. My husband and our son love these bracelets!"
4.0,"Lovely piece - chain very thin, stone slightly off color, but it sure looks good!!"
4.0,Not quite as thick as buffs but they work very well.  Really nice to have as backups.
4.0,"I really liked it got a lot of compliments about it, however the built runs pretty small, I got a size up and still too small. Also really hard to get out of by yourself"
4.0,The hat is nice and soft. But the problem is that every time my daughter turns to side the hat pulls up or pulls down and shuts her eyes. Maybe it will work for older kids
4.0,Very nice shirt but shrinks as you dry it.
4.0,I use it everything just a little too tight
4.0,"I love it so much I can’t stop wearing it, although I did have to bend it a little so I would fit my forehead but it worked out"
4.0,i swore from the description this would be a &#34;spinner&#34; ring. Regardless its a nice looking/fitting ring.
4.0,I really like this fashionable chain. It's pretty good quality  and doesn't look and feel cheap at all.
4.0,"The belt feels sturdy and should hold up for a while.  I looks exactly as pictured on the website. I purchased a medium... it's a little shorter than I expected, but works.. If I had ordered a large it would have been too long.  My waist measurement is 36""."
4.0,I like these earrings a lot but they are an off-white color similar to ivory.  They are not a true white.
4.0,Exactly as described and the glasses were perfect. But the only thing that made it 4 stars is the packaging the only thing that saved these glasses was the bubble wrap and plastic holding it together. The box was wet and barely intact.
4.0,Size up one size in my opinion.
4.0,"A little small on top, but fits well!"
4.0,Item as described. If you want a tighter fit order one size down
4.0,Made a 15 year old girl happy for Christmas. Probably too expensive for what it is
4.0,"Although this pin is smaller than I thought it would be, it's very pretty and I plan to use it on my work smock."
4.0,The most I like is the design and fabric the least is pockets are already coming off
4.0,Great earrings for the price. I bought them for my only bridesmaid that didn't have pierced ears. She's happy and I'm happy!
4.0,"The sweater is cute, and pretty heavy. I thought it would be thinner, so that was a pleasant surprise.  Fit as expected. It had a bad smell when I first opened it, and had to wash immediately."
4.0,"Got here faster then it said.  Looks just like the pic.  Just got it today and so far so good.<br />Update a couple of hours after wearing it. Have gotten lots of compliments on it.  It's been sliding alot.  Iam going to have to find a way to make it nonslip.  Other then that, I love it"
4.0,It is a bit smaller than expected
4.0,"Nice shirt, good cut but a little small, order a size bigger."
4.0,This is a great change from the surgical masks. No ear tugging or marks from tight masks. I can finally go out.<br />Safely to be walking around maintaining social distancing. I chose this one because I loved the galaxy print
4.0,They keep my pants from riding up when I wear in my boots.  Works better with tapered ankles than they do with bootcut jeans.
4.0,"I loved the colors in each pair in this package, they do run a little small but that is to be expected with stone sometimes but overall I loved them."
4.0,Waiting for my granddaughter to arrive any day now! Just loved seeing &#34;Nonna&#34; in a bracelet like this!! Charms are lovely but the wire is a little spotty looking. That is why I did not give it Five Stars! Otherwise very happy and wearing it proudly!!
4.0,This was purchased as a gift. Looks like the photo. Very nice.
4.0,Runs slightly large..I wish I had ordered a small instead of medium.. Overall great addition to my under garments lol
4.0,somehat larger than specified but I love it and can change it up a bit.
4.0,"The split is more to the left than center & it runs long, sort of like a dress and top in one. Perfect for taller ladies and more flattering to hippy ladies as it hides allot."
4.0,Very sophisticated looking.
4.0,Wore once quit working or never did
4.0,My fiance looses keys so the brightness is handy
4.0,"Looks exactly like the picture. Fit well. Only conplaint is it is pretty see through, wish it was lined. But the material is nice and overall quality skirt. Just be prepared to wear some nude undies. When I got the skirt my waist was a 34 but I have lost weight since and am now a 31.5. Due to the elastic waist band it still fits."
4.0,Para protegerme del sol
4.0,I normally wear medium but it was very tight around the rib cage so I returned it for a large which fit well.  Got tons of compliments.  Really fun for dressy summer party.
4.0,"Just answered a question and I figured I should write a review. These are better than regular panyhose, not as durable as standard leggings.<br /><br />Sizing up might not be a bad idea. These will take a but of effort to get into. I bought a set for me (L for about 130lbs and 5'6&#34; ish) and a smaller size for my daughter. I made my pair longer and she started hers higher on the leg. Neither of us experienced rolling and it was difficult enough to get on that I knew I would be pleased with the support. I had more trouble with my undershirt staying in place than my leggings. I felt supported the entire time, but that support meant bathroom time was a bit of a production.<br /><br />They worked for what we needed, they take effort to get on and off that may or may not be a good thing, depending on what you are looking for and if you can get into the size you ordered. We were comfortable and happy all day in ours. The reinforced (through extra woven strength, not panel) panty area, held up for what we needed and they can easily be worn again as neither of us got a snag. In fact, that would be my one concern. Once you snag these, they would be holy and unusable for many things. But if you can keep them safe, they are good.<br /><br />Took off one star because of slight sizing issues and the fact that you can tell a snag is the difference between a good time and not."
4.0,This skirt is cute but there is something I can't put my finger on that make's it look a little matronly. The fit was fine but the waist was a littler larger than expected.
4.0,I love the dress but the strip broke very easy but it’s still look great
4.0,Bought 4 of these and liked them very much. I received 1 with a hole in it and I’m trying to figure out how to exchange. I’m nervous to do a return because I feel like it’s from China. But overall I am very happy.
4.0,Great dress for my big boob sisters. I’m a DD and I don’t have to wear a bra with it! Great summer dress.
4.0,Size appropriate. Lining  inside a  little thin. But OK.
4.0,It's pretty and perfectly like the picture!
4.0,"The necklace is lovely, Unfortunately, it arrived with the Starry Night pendant unattached — I think the ring it was supposed to hang from was broken. Fortunately, however, my husband is good at fixing this sort of thing. Also: it came in a lovely gift box."
4.0,"Love this!  Coverage and support are awesome, the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the dual clasp is a little tricky to secure."
4.0,"It's cheap, but it doesn't look it. I like that I can size it. Great little gift too. I would recommend it."
4.0,"This is a lovely dress, I wear SS, s or m, depending on recommendations. Way to small a dress for an adult."
4.0,"I got a size large which I wore with a strapless bra (38DD bra). The fabric is wide enough in the bar to cover the band of a strapless bra. It’s cute and not see through,  but it feels really cheap. But it will work for a few uses at least!"
4.0,"It is a little narrower at the waist than I anticipated, but it still fits fine. It bunches a little when I move, but that's about it. The white fabric tends to wrinkle. Very sleek, however, and I don't regret buying it."
4.0,"For summer I like a thinner sock in my hiking shoes, these fit the bill nicely. The fit is great, they don’t bag around the heels or ankle and still protect my feet in the boots or shoes. Good value as well."
4.0,It was tight across my chest had to were an under shirt.
4.0,A bit thicker then what I was expecting but very cute. Soft and comfortable.
4.0,"This is a very fun, sexy, and casual summer dress that comes in beautiful, vibrant colors perfect for risk-takers and ladies with curvy bodies. Considering the low price, it’s a definite steal!<br /><br />The shipping takes a long time to North America but the dress is worth the wait. It arrived in perfect condition, without any odor even though it is imported. If you shop online a lot like I do, you know this is a big plus as most garments that are made in China have weird and possibly repulsive smells. But this dress is as described and the best quality you can get at this price.<br /><br />The sizing is quite standard. I am 5’9 and my measurements are 34(B)-23-34. I ordered it in size Small and it fits me like a glove, ending at my knees. The material is mostly polyester with some spandex, therefore, it is quite stretchy and hugs your curves well. You do not have to worry about wrinkling either.<br /><br />The dress may look a little thin in photos and when it is not on, but once you put it on, you will see that it is not so cheap looking after all, nor is it see-through. The material is super soft and skin-friendly. All of this makes it the perfect summer outfit for many casual outdoor and indoor settings, day or night, shopping with girlfriends or drinking with your date at a bar. Considering how sexy this dress is, I have to particularly emphasize on that last part. :D<br /><br />The cut of this dress is very cute and sexy. The slit is well-places and this is the perfect dress for curvier ladies. I never wear bras under garments, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it held everything up quite well! Also, the colors are very vibrant. I ordered the yellow dress even though no reviewer had and so I took a big risk. I could not be happier that I did. The color is better than pictured and very vibrant. It is very summery, hot shade of yellow. At a very low price, you get a super hot, cute, and unique summer dress.<br /><br />*** I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,I couln't believe all those beautiful earings for this price :) love them
4.0,Love the purse but it is not &#34;white&#34;.  It is a cream color.  I will keep it but really wanted WHITE.
4.0,Great quality and easy to iron out wrinkles with damage or fading. Not thin or transparent. The tie back is a little irregular but not a huge issue
4.0,"Growing up as a kid in a Christian and Catholic household, I was a big fan of the Super Natural TV show and was always drawn to pentagrams.  Until medieval times, the five points of the pentagram represented the five wounds of Jesus Christ on the Cross.  It was a symbol of Christ the Savior.  Eventually, the church chose the cross to be a more significant symbol for Christianity and the use of the pentagram as a Christian symbol gradually ceased.  Despite this, the pentagram for centuries has long been believed to be a potent symbol of protection against evil that can shield the wearer and the home.  A circle around the pentagram contains and protects.  The circle symbolizes eternity and infinity, the cycles of life and nature.  The circle touches all five points indicating that the spirit, earth, air and water are all interconnected.<br /><br />In the Wiccan world, the Pentacle is the prime energy-containing symbol depicting a five pointed star contained within a circle.  These five points of the Pentacle stand for the four directions or four elements plus the Center and Spirit, which represents the unity of all facets of the world into one expression of the Divine.  This is why a Pentacle at times is represented by a human man standing with all limbs outstretched forming a rudimentary star shape.  This human star inside the circle of the aura creates a living Pentacle.  Part of the Pentacle's power of protection relies on the fact that it is drawn with a single unbroken line.  This leaves no gateways for the unwanted energies to enter or for Power to dissipate.<br /><br />Wicca jewelry is typically worn on the Power Centers of the body, which are the key energy points that link the physical body to the spiritual or energetic realm.  Jewelry worn at these points serve both to bring focus to these areas and to stimulate these areas so that the Power there can be accessed and increased.  Wicca jewelry activates and enhances the Power Centers of the body.  In necklace form, the pendant is attached to a chain or string that often rests at the heart center, focusing particular energies that you wish to bring into yourself.<br /><br />Everything that goes into making the Wiccan jewelry brings its own energy into it.  The metals, the gem stones, the symbols and even the colors all have meaning and certain powers.  Use of silver metal represents the symbol of the Moon and the Goddess, the soul and the beauty of the Wheel of Life.  Gem stones are valued by Wiccan's for their healing properties and their abilities to hold and channel energies, which makes them so helpful in magical task and healing.  They act as containers for magical energy, making them ideal as altar tools and charms for spells.  The Power of gem stones are thought to arise from their connection with the Earth, giving them their healing power.  Gem stones are manifestations of the Earth's innate compassion.  As an example, the hematite (black gem) is used for grounding one's self, clarifying thoughts, improving memory and calming anxiety.<br /><br />I have been looking to add to my pentagram collection and stumbled upon a Pentagram Jewelry Necklace, Wiccan Pentacle charm with black Swarovski Crystal sold by Dan Jewelers on Amazon.  This fine-crafted pewter pendant is nickle-free and is about 1.8 inches in height and weights about 0.9 ounces.  When I received the pendant, I noticed that it came with a Dan Jewelers-branded black velvet jewelry bag to store your pendant and a stylish adjustable rope necklace attached to the pendant.  The pentagram is designed in an overlapping pattern on a circle with six black Swarovski Crystals in which five of these crystals outline around the circle and one crystal in the center of the pentacle.  The loop at the top of the pendant that holds the fabric necklace has a Celtic knot-like pattern just like the circle also having some Celtic-like pattern.  The pendant is fairly thick and very sturdy.  The rope necklace that is attached is adjustable and very comfortable to wear.  I have not had any problems with the necklace or pendant chaffing, irritating or causing an allergic reaction on my skin.<br /><br />In summary, overall I was please with the Pentagram Jewelry Necklace, Wiccan Pentacle charm with black Swarovski Crystal sold by Dan Jewelers.  The only complaints that I have are that the pewter metal could have been polished more, and that the glue that holds the Swarovski Crystals in there notches could have been glued in such a way as to not have it spill over on top of some of the crystals.  This obscures the shine and sparkle of the crystals.  While the glue can be gently removed one has to be very careful in doing so.  This pendant is not perfectly made or devoid of any impurities, but it makes a fine collection piece for pendant lovers.<br /><br />I received this pentagram jewelry necklace at a discount price in exchange for my non-biased review.  In doing so, I hope that this review will be beneficial to those interested in buying this product."
4.0,These shorts are great for my old bones. Helps me want to get on  my bike and ride!
4.0,"This is truly a beautiful chakra necklace,  have already ordered several...took off 1 star though because my necklace lost a stone within a week!"
4.0,"I am generally happy with these goggles. They fit well with the strap and look good. However, they do fog up at stoplights in hot weather. But as you pull away from the light you only need to lift the goggle off your face for a second and the fog clears up immediately."
4.0,"Overall I love it, but I did need to trim the inside to be more comfortable on my nose, because before I did it hurt and left a mark on my bridge. Otherwise amazing product"
4.0,Well made and pretty
4.0,"I bought this for a trip to the Bahamas. it has plenty of space, but the zippers wore out quick.. like 5 zips in and it started snagging. It is pretty big and the best use I found was around the neck. the belt loop was the way I wanted it to work, but that proved to be the most awkward way to fish out an ID or money. Looks nice"
4.0,It is okay. Thanks!
4.0,"This is a very cute workout top that is made from a nice material.  My only issue is that it is a bit on the tight side when tied, just a little too small."
4.0,"Love the material and style of this dress, exactly as pictured.  Was pleased it has length to it also, hit me just above the knee.  I'm 5'7.5"" and when dresses show they hit above the knee they usually come shorter.  It was also a little too big for me, not enough for me to exchange for a smaller size though, so I guess that's where I gained some length as well.  Would like to buy a second one  : )<br />Just for reference (since that is what I look for in reviews also), I weigh 156-160Ibs, with 38"" bust, 34""waist and 42"" hips."
4.0,"I purchased 6 of these to use for my sisters wedding. Used by Officiant, Groom and Groomsmen. They fit well on all but one uf us, due to the elastic in back of the cap. Granted my brother-in-law has a very big head, so no complaints fom others on sizing. The hats come with a silk type quilted interior with a feel of elegance. The material itself varied with consistentcy in color, we wore the charcoal gray, with some hats having very small white spots embedded in the felt material. Not a deal breaker, but not perfect either. These hats are better for use in cooler weather due to the thermal properties of the inner lining. Everyone, including the 120 guests, raved at the bling factor these newsboy caps brought to the occasion. If not for the inconsistencies in the hat material itself (small white spots), I would have rated them five stars. It is definitely a four and half star product though."
4.0,"I just received the band. It took awhile to arrive, but I was aware of that when I ordered. It’s beautiful and I would definitely order it again based upon looks. However, I docked a star because there is a black smudge on the band that won’t come off (I tried my best to capture it in the 3rd picture I posted). I’m afraid if I rub too much it may make some of the design rub off too. This seems to be fairly durable (better than expected!), but I haven’t worn it for much longer than it took to write this review. If I have anything else worthwhile to add to this review I’ll update it. :)"
4.0,"the shoes was very uncomfortable and I should have return them sooner, I like the shoe but it wasn't good fit. Not enough support and the shoe didn't fit very well. I hope you be consider and let me return them. I haven't worn them, I only walk around the house in them and I have carpet on floors. Thank You"
4.0,very cute and sits right in my navel almost perfectly
4.0,I bought them to have a low profile shoe and a no drop shoe needless to say the shoe fits both descriptions. Lifting in these is a breeze and there have been no problems during long runs but short sprints are problematic. It has treated me well so far 30 miles in.<br />PROS:<br />Comfortable on long runs.<br />The sole is strong enough to prevent penetration from sharp objects.<br />True no shoe feel<br />CONS:<br /> The only con I have experienced so far is the fabric expands with the foot while otherwise great It is detrimental to sprints.
4.0,I purchased the grey groove ring months ago and love it so I decided to get another one. I found one with a design I liked and it's completely different!  When I first opened it up I immediately saw the cracks in the design and thought it was a cheap wrap. As I'm messing with it it's become more flexible and the cracks you see in the picture don't show up while it's on.
4.0,It was tighter than I expected but its wearable.
4.0,Very pretty but stones fall out. Fortunately they are easy to glue back in.
4.0,"order a size up , runs small."
4.0,"These are cute but don't think they will make your butt look bigger. That's a lie. If you have a round and firm butt, these will look amazing. If you have a flat or jiggly butt, it will still look flat and jiggly. If you size down they will be see through. The legs are super long and the fabric bunches up in your ankles. Keep in mind these are made to look cute but the fabric is not supportive or moisture wicking. Not recommended for very active sports."
4.0,"I wear this every day. My only complaint is that the rhinestone fell out almost immediately, however, idk how that's actually supposed to work and be visible anyways so it's not a big deal."
4.0,Nice for this price...
4.0,The frames seem a little flimsy but the glasses are good.  We live along the coast and get a lot of glare off the ocean but these cut it nicely without being too dark.
4.0,"These drivers eliminated all of the noise that my printer used to make, which is great, but here's why I didn't give them 5 stars. I replaced the A4988's on my RAMPS 1.4 with the TMC2100's, being careful not to install them backwards. Then I reversed the motor connections since the DIR pin is inverted on these, turned on the power, and started a print. I spent the first 3-4 layers marveling at how quiet the printer was with the TMC2100's, then I realized I had forgotten to remove the microstepping jumpers on the RAMPS board. It was still printing at the correct size, so I was definitely getting 1/16 microstepping, and quiet enough that I had to assume that I was getting the 1/256 interpolation. I read the TMC2100 datasheet while I waited for the print to finish, and with all the jumpers installed, I should not have been getting the 1/256 interpolation. After the first print finished, I turned off the printer and removed the jumpers. The behavior during the second print was identical to the first. I think they have made this board in such a way that CFG1, CFG2, and CFG3 have no effect on the output of the driver. This means that I have no way to adjust the microstepping unless I want to start soldering to ultra tiny things. It might be set to stealth chop mode instead of spread cycle. I haven't missed any steps yet, but I haven't tried pushing the speed past 60mm/s either. Overall, I'm happy with these drivers since my printer is much quieter now, but I would prefer to have access to the other settings."
4.0,This was a gift for my husband!! He wears it to work and absolutely loves it! It has a soft feel and fits him great!!! It was a good buy!!!
4.0,"I got these in coffee and champagne. In the officials picture the champagne frame is consistently colored. The glasses I received had champagne temples and outer frames, but brown bridge and inner frame. I assumed it was a flawed pair, started a refund, and ordered a second pair. They arrived today with the same brown area. Looking at other uploaded pictures you can see what I'm talking about. It's a shame because, while it's not unattractive, it's not what I want. Wish I could get these frames in solid champagne as pictured.<br /><br />That said, I love everything else about these sunglasses. It can be hard to find oversized frames without embellishments, and these are perfect."
4.0,Very pretty bifocal shades with the sparkle on the side. They are a little darker tint than I prefer.
4.0,"Cute and nice dress but the bust line is off for me. You can see the bra below the bust line of the dress, looks not so good."
4.0,nice well made
4.0,Smaller than expected. But still a quality shirt
4.0,"GREAT LENGTH TO IT! I'm 5'5&#34;, 190 lbs, 36DD and it fits so NICELY!"
4.0,"I received this as a gift 7 months ago and still love it!  I have to carry two phones around (both full size in bulky cases), so I have a few of these mainly for work, in lieu of a purse.  It also fits my car keys and a half dozen cards (credit, debit, license, etc).  With all this stuff, it still zips easily and the handle is ...handy :)  It's not as neutral as some of my others, but it is still professional enough for the office (no bling on this at all!)  The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is because it doesn't have an interior pocket - that would be really helpful to keep the cards tucked away as they frequently get pulled out with my phones.  Overall, great buy for the price!"
4.0,"The fabric seems to be of good quality, love the smocking. It fits but I could've used an XS but it only came in a S. Can't wait to wear this out."
4.0,Really impressed!
4.0,Beautiful dress.  Material<br />Is just a little thin/sheer.
4.0,Excellent purchase.  Great with casual shorts or slacks for summer and particularly for someone who struggles with minor weight changes but looks great. Only wish there was more information on actual size ranges in inches for the belts.
4.0,Got some of the same pairs but loved overall
4.0,These were a gift. She absolutely loved them!
4.0,"Nice,  runs large"
4.0,"This bag is pretty solid.  I purchased it for a 2 week overseas trip and as a day pack it was excellent!  My only complaint it that it is not fully waterproof.  Water seemed to be able to go through the zipper to the main pocket.  I will admit, I was out walking around all day in constant rain and it took until the end of the day to finally leak through, but enough got through to wrinkle the corner of pages of a book.  Overall I do recommend, but I was a bit disappointed with the claim to be rainproof."
4.0,"Like these Christmas novelty socks pretty well.  They're well made but the material isn't especially thick or heavy, which is to be expected since they're not really everyday socks.  Best of all the colors are very bright and festive so that they make a bold Christmas style statement.  The fit is good to work with a range of foot sizes too.  I got these for my wife and daughter, who both wear a women's size 7 and they fit great, but I could also wear them on my size 11 men's feet just fine.  Very happy with them!"
4.0,Cute dress but thin material.  Will have to wear something under this
4.0,purchased for wife and she loves it..
4.0,Great belt at an affordable price.  But be careful on sizes.  Had to return one because the size charts weren't accurate.  My waist is 38&#34; and I had to buy the belt that was 31.5-34.3.  36.6-39.3 was way to big for my 38&#34; waist.
4.0,It’s not a very bright orange color and runs small
4.0,"Very cute, shows cleavage"
4.0,When I purchased this product I thought I was going to get just 8 LED Finger Lights.  Nope!!!  More like 80 packs of 4.  Good deal for the price.
4.0,The necklace came as described. I wish it was longer because the length I got is almost like a choker on me lol. I’d order again though!
4.0,"I like these pajamas, but would prefer the pants in a capri length. Or, if they would have petite sizing.  But the material is great!"
4.0,"The top fits like a large, but the bottoms are small for a large"
4.0,Robe looks great. Would be nice to have an tie on the inner side. The slick materal often allows it to slide open even when tightly tied with the sash.
4.0,"Love these! Achieved the look I was looking for. I did not get two blue charms like it showed in the picture so was a little disappointed, but other than that love them."
4.0,"These are definitely not a bad training sweatpants, there are a few things that I really like about them and a few things that can be improved in the future by the manufacturer. The fit is good, I ordered size M which I normally order for a similar style pants, I am 5 foot 10 inches tall and about 190 pounds, the waist line is perfect as for the length, they are slightly shorter, I think a half or maybe even a full inch would have made them perfect.<br />The elastic waist band is combined with an additional string for extra secure fit, the material is light so if you are planning to wear them when its really cold outside, you might be a little disappointed, but for mild weather or wearing around the house and gym they should be fine. My plan is to use them for soccer practices in the colder fall months and maybe even the winter, but I have a suspicion that the sweat dissipation might not be significant as the cotton content is more compared to the other high performance training pants that relay on synthetic materials that keep the sweat away form your body. Anyway, for indoor training or casual wear they should be just fine, speaking of casual the bottom of both left and right legs have zippers and they are placed on the medial side of them and not the lateral, which is good, it makes the for a cleaner look when you wear them with sneakers. Overall, I like those, one last note would be the price, I think if they keep the price under $20 they would be a great option for casual/gym wear."
4.0,I really like them for work
4.0,"So the product description does not match the shirt design shown.  The descriptions says, &#34;Midnight Society Charter Member&#34; but the shirt pictured says &#34;Camp Anawanna&#34;.  I really liked the &#34;Camp Anawanna&#34; shirt but, did in fact receive the &#34;Midnight Society&#34; shirt.  I love them both so  I am satisfied that I got my moneys worth=)  I would still like the other shirt though and possibly would have gotten a different color had I known I was getting this shirt but, I am still happy with my purchase.  Both of these shows were a big part of my childhood and I think it is awesome that people are making merchandise for nerds like me!"
4.0,"I like a few of the other pieces I got with this one better, but I will definitely wear it often! Enamel looks better in person. Great quality for the price! Also expected delivery was earliest April 13th and got it end of march!"
4.0,Sharp tie with a nice color contrast/combo.  It can develop small fabric pulls or snags so be careful how you handle it.
4.0,The cord starts to fray after a couple of months but still a great product!
4.0,"Quality is nice, except the color displayed is misleading.  In the picture looks more red, but what I recieved is almost brown and some red. therefore, 4 stars"
4.0,Very pretty but little small.
4.0,Love these! I can’t believe I haven’t gotten them sooner. I’m really OCD with my shoes. I’ll be ordering more!
4.0,It fits well and the zipper detail in front makes it a more unique look. Using the zipper detail you can customize the neckline. The only detractor was the back zipper is one of those tiny zippers that's hard to do yourself. Flattering on pear shaped women.
4.0,"They looks great on, but they are super fitted.  Order at least 2 sizes up, even if you want it as a compression shirt."
4.0,I got these because I realized that all of my ties were in one color area and this had ones from the other sides.  I like that they are not plain solid colored ones but are in fact textured which allows for better pairing.
4.0,"I waited 6 months for this due to Covid, not the senders fault it was stuck in customs. My daughter loves it."
4.0,Straps diameters are larger than I expected.
4.0,"Thought the chain would be longer but I just replaced it. Other then that, I loved it!"
4.0,"These are nice! The silver is not nearly as bright and shiny as depicted; however, they are well made. Given that these are a pain in the butt captive ball type jewelry, I haven't  worn them yet. They feel a bit heavy for lobe piercings and are likely more suited to helix or other cartilage piercings."
4.0,"Okay ladies lets be real. It fits! Its cofortable , nice material... just not 100 pecent sure the suppprt i need...  280 44DDD... so of course i need heavy dudy.. not hevy dutey but im glad i baught it gret deal for price!"
4.0,"I like the concept, I loved the material, I loved the support that it gives to the breasts & upper back, however - the steel boned lines in the back I didn't like. I also didn't like the way it made everything look once all fastened.  I was able to go to each level on the eyelets except the very last one. So I tried each to see what would be the most comfortable and best look.  Each pulled it all in but instead of kinda flattening the stomach, it more or less made mine look round...like flat under the breasts, round (protruding) in the middle and flat again toward the bottom if that makes sense! I'm trying to describe the best way I can, looks nothing like the girl pictured (but she doesn't need one anyway!). The length of it goes to the crack of the buttocks or a little past, which is good however, the steel boned lines in the back cause it to bulge back there right above the butt/below the waist and its not a good look.  So overall, I have mixed feelings about this garment and decided I am going to return and give up this solution.  I've tried two different brands & sizes, it doesn't work for me.  Good luck ladies!"
4.0,Runs a size smaller but very cute!
4.0,They’re cool
4.0,It did not print real dark
4.0,"Even though it fit as expected, the fabric is very clingy.  It clings to all the curves you don't want shown.  It's very comfortable and I wear it around my home but I will not wear this to work or our to a function."
4.0,"I'm a curvy size 10/12 and the large fit me great. The liners eventually come apart on these but after 6 months I still have 2 pairs that are good. My biggest complaint is that I wasn't sent the colors advertised. I got a nice nude and black pair but the rest were very loud colors like fuchsia, turquoise and bright pink. Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase and will order again."
4.0,"I flipped out a little when I first tried on this bracelet because it was just way too big for my wrist. But with some arts and crafts, I was able to just the leather band and super-glue it back together in order to make it shorter. If you are going to do this, make sure you do it near the end of the band so and wrap silver duct tape around the incision after super-gluing. This tape will blend in with the clamp, and no one will notice. I have received many compliments of this bracelet, and it looks fantastic. It feels a little cheap, and the bands are much sturdier than I thought they would be. But, then again, this bracelet is pretty cheap, and it is worth the money (if you have scissors and super-glue)."
4.0,"This dress is good for the price you pay. It is not as stretchy as it is advertised, just a simple cotton dress. It works nicely as a maternity dress and would still work post baby. I am 5'9&#34; and it goes down to my knees. Need to wear a cami underneath because it is beyond low cut. A nice summer dress."
4.0,"These are high quality, soft socks. They are extremely comfortable, durable, and thick. I don't think my feet will ever get cold again with these in my arsenal. I like the neutral gray and black colors. Even though these keep my feet warm, they do not feel heavy which makes these so great. I did have to take a star off this rating because even though these look and feel great, there is no way I can wear these with any of my shoes. They are just way too thick. Other than that, these are a nice warm pair of Winter socks for a good price."
4.0,"I’m normally a 12/14 and ordered the XL and it fit comfortably, nice and roomy. The mustard color is beautiful. Unfortunately, mine arrived with a strong chemical smell and I ended up soaking it in a vinegar wash on the gentle cycle. That did help. It does takes a few weeks to arrive so if you need it immediately don’t order here. Overall, I’m satisfied with this purchase. I will review again once I know how well it holds up."
4.0,"I have had them for a couple of months now and they work great they are holding up nicely. The lens are a little big, but they look great."
4.0,Very well fitted in finger tips. The wrist detail seems flimsy.
4.0,I liked it. A little long I’ll have to fix it but I’m short.
4.0,Very pretty. Smaller then I wanted but I do wear them. Good buy.
4.0,"I love these shorts! The stitching came loose after a few days, but that's an easy fix."
4.0,"Love bracelet, the letter was a little loose."
4.0,My son and I went shopping at Tysons mall and he got a lot of compliments from the teens; I thought it made too much noise...it is hollow.
4.0,"It's a very cute shirt, love the criss cross on top. It's very soft with some stretch. The only issue I have is that it's a little thin so I hope it holds up well in the wash. It runs a little on the small size. I usually wear a size 12, large on top and had to size up to an XL and it's snug but stretchy."
4.0,"The liner is very thin and cheap feeling, but it's an ok bag for the amount of light traveling I do."
4.0,Really like them. One complaint:slightly small and no half sizes.  I normally wear an 8.5 or 9. I would have ordered a 9.5 if they had it. The 9 is a bit snug. But I will wear nylons with them. All good.
4.0,They fit nice and are warm
4.0,I love this wearable blanket it’s very nice very comfortable I love it plus the color thank you
4.0,Too large for my watch. Good quality.
4.0,"Nice dress, but it was too tight for me.  I gave it to a friend who looks fabulous in it and she loves it!"
4.0,"This is a great pair of yoga pants. I am about 5 ft 7 inches, I found that the yoga pants didn't reach my ankles as shown in the picture."
4.0,Bought these for my girl's 08 Toyota Rav 4 with 16&#34; steel wheels. They fit fine and look much better than the stock ones from Toyota. My only complaint is that the metal ring has a groove that needs to be lined up with the valve stem when you put the wheel covers together. I looked at the pic on the directions to make sure the offset was facing the right way like in the photo but ended up cracking one of the new wheel covers because the directions did not specify that the groove was for valve stem clearance so I ended up figuring it out the hard way. I just ordered another set to replace the one I broke and have a few on hand. At $32 I really don't care considering genuine Toyota wheel covers are $80 each.
4.0,They are just ok... I wished there were more grips to the sock..
4.0,"I like this sweater - its a great weight with a shirt underneath.  The size was correct based on reading reviews. However, it doesn't look like this photo, the fabric and button placement is different than the photos.  I ordered the coffee and its similar but mine has flecks of colors in it.  It did take a LONG time to arrive but I would order this again."
4.0,"True to size mostly. Im 170lbs, 5’2” and top heavy. A large gave 1” loose room on waist sides. The sheen from the polyester makes it look cheap but it’s a nice pattern. Better if were cotton."
4.0,So cute i really Love this shoes just that are Little big for me but anyway I use
4.0,I Love the style of these shorts and ended up buying them in 3 different colors lol! My friend is now interested in getting a pair. I got them in a size large.
4.0,"Nice bag, but too small for my laptop,"
4.0,"Bought for my daughter.  Had to exchange for next size up, but made nice and looks beautiful on her!"
4.0,Looks nice and delivered quickly!
4.0,"Great hat! It is comfortable, looks good, and helps keep me warm. :)"
4.0,A little short even in a large fit like a med/small. But texture and quality are good. Color is true to pic.
4.0,"It's a great watch. The product arrived on time and, the watch keeps good time. The watch face is a little smaller than I expected, but it still fits well around my wrist. I'm showing it off with my other watches in a display box. I would definitely order from them again."
4.0,Nice workout shirts. Fit as expected. Comfortable
4.0,"They look nice but sadly I may have ordered them a bit too small so I ordered another and the new ones fit me pretty well and they’re pretty nice and comfy, so for me personally they are pretty good."
4.0,Very flattering cute fit.  I was a little surprised that the fabric is a light weight ribbed cotton.  The lace trim is very pretty & well made. Can't wait for warm weather so I can wear it!
4.0,fit as expected ang comfy to wear jreat for just a relax day.
4.0,The blue is much darker than picture. Still beautiful though.
4.0,"I’ve been using these at work for about two weeks now. They seem to be holding up well and they’re very warm. My only complaint is that they are a little tight,especially on my nose. I have the string all the way out and it kinda pulls my nose to the side when I’m wearing it."
4.0,"Cute! A little large for my 1 year old and they slip off, but she'll grow into them."
4.0,Great price and overall manufacturing on this wallet. Holds all that I need it too and still has room for more. A hard cased wallet I was carrying before this one was 1/4 bigger and could hold all that this one does.
4.0,"Very light and see thru fabric. Kinda small. But I think if I would got a size bigger it would of been to big. Had to get spandex because the shorts are super short, it's like wearing boots shorts which I'm not comfortable with but still looks cute."
4.0,"They are cute, but are so tight it cuts my circulation off... and I have small ankles..."
4.0,These are cool I didn’t get 1 of the colors I wanted but they are as described
4.0,"This dress arrived promptly from seller.  It had a scratchy feel, but after one wash, it was perfect.  It fit nicely and I received many compliments.  I would recommend this dress to large chested gals.  I'm a 38dd and a it fit me really well."
4.0,"Looks just like the photos. They are larger then I expected, larger then a quarter, all same size. Really cute filigree design and extremely light weight. Took 27 days to arrive."
4.0,The only thing is that the alastic in the waste is very annoying and tight sometimes. Don't wear for very long periods of time or the heat and moisture inside will irritate your privates. :/
4.0,"Comfortable to wear, and as of yet it's exhibited very sturdy qualities."
4.0,Beautiful pocketbook at an incredible pric
4.0,These are incredible leggings for feel and warmth but would be difficult to put on if you weighed more than 130 pounds.
4.0,Love it for beach. A bit thin to wear without a slip. Light and airy
4.0,"WRITEN by Mrs Hammond - This belt pulls a casual, smart outfit together - taking the look up a notch.  I would recommend.  They do need to add more colours."
4.0,Very pretty but it is huge.
4.0,Loved these pants and was really looking forward to wearing them.  Unfortunately the pants run large; I ordered a women's 8-10 but they are more towards the 10 size which made the crotch area extremely baggy.  I recommend ordering a small if you are normally a medium and you'll look great!
4.0,"It's very...""handy"""
4.0,The print
4.0,The product was great but I expected the rings to be a tad bit larger and the chain to be a bit longer. But not bad for the price
4.0,Very nice cord necklace. I receive one long one and one slightly shorter one and they will work perfectly for some of my casual slides.
4.0,"These are okay for the money, not as clear as I would like"
4.0,It's beautiful and the material stretches. A little snug for me in the chest but the length is great and it's great for my shape. I'd recommend a slip or something underneath if you order white like I did. Love it!
4.0,Nice dress and fits fine
4.0,Love the Bag
4.0,"shipping is ridiculous, shirts ok, I didnt realize how gang related it might look though"
4.0,My father reports that they fit well and provide adequate arch support.
4.0,Idk how to explain this but the buttons for the mask seem a little misplaced OR perhaps my head is slightly small. Either way a few extra buttons for mask adjustment would be an improvement and perhaps a little stretch would be nice. . Over all does the job.
4.0,Better than the original band.  I only gave it 4 stars because the loop that holds the flap is so loose that it easily slips off.
4.0,Very comfortable. I wear them when I go to the pool since they support my feet and I can leave them outside so I don't track wet spots through my house.
4.0,"Fits as expected.comfortable to walk in... Only issue with Nine West - the tip of the heels are plastic , come off after a month or so"
4.0,"A little small but I like it, very cute"
4.0,"very nice, haven't sported it yet but I did try it on and it very nice."
4.0,"They look adorable. Wore these everyday, consistently for a few months. They &#34;gold&#34; part discolored after a while. It doesn't bother me too much; I still wear them. Not very difficult to adjust to your ear."
4.0,The listing says leather but band is silicone. Still nice
4.0,"Works great! Yes, it can be tiring work to polish silver jewelry, especially if it's very tarnished. But this cloth di a great job of it. I had a few pieces of silver jewelry I just couldn't wear anymore because they were all black, and this cloth brought them back to life! In the photo included, you can see the difference between the tarnished earring and the freshly polished one! I prefer a cloth like this for jewels because it mush harder to keep the creams and liquids away from the stones, which are sensitive to any polishing products."
4.0,"I'll start this review out by saying I would have given this product to five star review had the first mass that I pulled out not been missing an earloop, I was a little disappointed finding that being the first one however none of the other ones seem to have any problems. They came vacuum sealed, and nicely stacked on top of one another so you can pull one right off the stack without snagging any of the other ones with it. They're very comfortable to where do they look a little silly like a beak. The triangle shaped feature of these makes them pull off of your mouth very nicely unlike some of the other ones that lay up right against your mouth and make you feel a little claustrophobic. I was worried about breathability because these kn95 masks are a little bit thicker than the blue throw away masks I usually use, however I think that the shape of them really allows for good breathability. They come in a pack of 30 which is awesome I just ran out of my pack of 50 that I usually keep in my car so I replaced it with these ones. I'm always leaving the house without remembering to bring a mask with me oh, and having a pack of these in my car has really saved me multiple times. They don't fit so well the children because of their adult size, however if you tie a little knot in the ear Loops the children can use them as well so it's saved us trips home to get their masks as well."
4.0,Daughter LOVES them. Cute color scheme and goes great with pants or dresses.
4.0,"I love these. The lace goes all the way around!!! Some I have gotten only had lace at the toe. Others my toe stuck through the lace. Nasty. But these were amazing. The reason for the 4 starts is that they are a bit on the small size. I wear a size 8, and they tend to slip off my heel and pull at my toes. There is no extra length. Just a warning for people with larger feet! Otherwise, they are perfect!"
4.0,Love it just not as manly as I thought it would be!
4.0,"My husband prefers to have shorts that are longer than these, but for doing stuff at home, they are fine. Washing the dog, vacuuming, folding laundry, etc. these work just fine. He wouldn't use them for the gym since he thinks they are too short on him. He's 6'1"" for reference."
4.0,"Good quality, no complaints on the product.. too bad they sent the wrong color, now it will have to be a late birthday present. :("
4.0,"a bit different, but look fine"
4.0,Dress is good and fits the body but little bigger in size....<br />size 6P could have been perfect fit.<br />Kindly provide more size options for such a good price : )
4.0,"This dress is really soft and comfortable. Unfortunately, while it fits well in the top and arms, the bottom half of the dress has what I think is an excessive amount of material, making it really big. I am 5'3&#34;, 120 lbs and I ordered a small. I considered returning it, but because it is so comfortable, I'm keeping it as a sleep shirt."
4.0,"You get what you pay for... However, I really love these! They are a good, dainty necklaces. I don't think they will last long, but they have held up okay so far (a month or two with regular wear). I will purchase again when I need to."
4.0,"I actually love this.  It’s loose fitting but because of the weight, still gives me shape.  The little holes and layers give it a warm, unique, character.  The color of fantastic- it matches my eyes.  I got a size large. I’m 5’5”, 185lbs, wide shoulders and large boobs<br /><br />*edit* this shrinks vertically after washes, making my waist appear even shorter.  This makes it a boxy t-shirt since the sides don’t also shrink inwards"
4.0,"purchased at REI couldn't decide between this and the $200 ozonic version.<br />the laminate feels nice on bare skin, its not chilly or clammy like previous jackets of mine. it has some crinkleness, but i've heard louder, the shell has a very tight weave pattern, no ripstop style squares.<br />Did the shower test, jogged 5 miles with a base layer and the jacket before hopping in the shower with it still on.<br />shower was 60 degrees, 1.5 gpm. stayed in for about 15 minutes (got bored, i was comfy, felt dry, the beading never stopped and there was no indication that it was going to fail anytime soon), arms down or horizontal, wiping down the arms periodically to induce water intrusion from surface tension disruption. shucked off the excess and pulled the jacket inside out.<br />dry (a tad misty) on the inside and no water intrusion, or failure spots from the high jet shower mode.<br />I did the same test on the ozonic and it started off with nice beading but failed in 5 minutes! soaked right through.<br />next test, 70 degree room, hung inside out on a jacket pole, picked it up 2 hours later and any moisture it had on the outside was gone, bone dry.<br />again, did the same test on the ozonic and it was still damp and sticky putting back on. that soft exterior fabric does no good at shedding water and ends up absorbing it.<br />the side pockets are HUGE, you could fit a 10in tablet or 2L water bladder in one. the front is actually 2 layers of the material, the outside layer and the pocket layer. it was impressive not to see any sweat buildup even in the front with 2 layers like that. plus, when you open your pocket, you won't have a gust of chilly wet air give you goose tummy. The downside though is that if they are open, water can pool up inside, there is no gusset or mesh to drain, puddle pockets.... in a survival situation this can actually be an advantage when you don't have any way of collecting water. if you have your cell phone unprotected, not so fun. The zippers held up to direct sprays from a garden nozzle so if its zipped your cool. if its raining i'd still baggie up my phone just in case i forget to zipper up.<br />the ozonic has mesh for the inner pocket layer, which solves the pooling but causes chilly wet tummy when you open or forget to zip up. thats ok, based on how poorly the ozonic held up to a simple shower, you'll be soaked soon even if you do remember.<br /><br />buy this one!"
4.0,I thought it was super cute but my wife is very particular and this just missed the passing grade.
4.0,Really cute and just like the picture. Metal not plastic. But the screws are backwards so it's pretty tricky to put on.
4.0,"The onesie and headband are high quality! The head band has a nice soft elastic band that is very comfortable for baby, though the unicorn top doesn’t bend to the curve of the baby’s head. The tutu is adequate but just pink tulle latched onto an elastic. If your baby is big there will be gaps between the tulle. Overall I’m very happy with this product for my daughter‘s 1st Birthday."
4.0,These are ever so handy when I need to sort things for our road trips. Many time I am carrying things for particular people we are stopping and seeing on our trip. These bags allow me to sort things ahead of time and hand off without worry. Having a sturdy reusable bag also makes the receiver very pleased. Love how these bags fold up nicely with its own pocket!  Definitely will recommend these!
4.0,A handful of these won't work. Still a big hit. Grown ups were taking them too. Great for travel car lights and middle of the night trips to the bathroom. The blue ones work like a blacklight to brighten glow stars.
4.0,"I thought the one tie was a little more on the red side when I got this for my hubby, but it is hot pink. Buyer beware! The silvery one is nice however. The quality seems to be decent — doesn’t feel cheap or scratchy."
4.0,"This costume is better than I expected (with so many pieces).  The only complaint I have is that the top and bottom don't seem to fit like a set.  I debated on which size to order, but went ahead and got the XL, anticipating it to run small like so many clothing items do.  My son normally wears a men's large, so worst case scenario, it might be a tad big...but I prefer that over too small.<br /><br />The hoodie looks fine on him, but the shorts were HUGE!!!  I didn't return it because I didn't want the hoodie any smaller than what we had.  Instead, I just took the waist in a few inches (...and no, I am not a seamstress!...it's a very bad job, but it works...ha!).  If the shorts had elastic, it might not have been as terrible, but it has a button and zipper.  A belt would likely have been ok for my son to use instead of taking the waist in, but I didn't want it to all bunch together in one place when he had to cinch the belt to the right size.<br /><br />For the price of the entire set (and quick shipping), it's better than I thought it would be. :)"
4.0,Would like to exchange for a bigger size. Package was sent back today
4.0,I wear a large but reviews said ran small so ordered xl. It's to big. It came with a hole in it.
4.0,"Based on the first use, it applies easily and wipes without streaks. However, it did not completely prevent fogging for me. Fog would dissipate faster than when not using it though."
4.0,It is very  good
4.0,"This cute collar is a fun accessory. The fur is soft and the rhinestones, while a tad cheesy, add some sparkle.It works well with both casual and more formal wear. Adds a touch of whmsy to the wardrobe."
4.0,"Really like the dress! Was pleasantly surprised the XL fit me because based on Amazon's height and weight estimate,it wouldn't.<br />Definitely still have some room,and I LOVE the length to cover my legs<br /><br />Excited to wear this to my friend's wedding. It does outline my belly but nothing Spanx can't fix."
4.0,It fits well. I don't know a lot about fabric but I found it a bit of a nuisance how the seams make it have to go on your head a certain way. It could probably also be a bit longer down the neck too. Other than that I do like it.
4.0,"Great looking bag, and for the majority of our Iceland trip, it held up. Towards the end, while we were at the airport, one of the strap ends broke off (not the metal part, just the fabric that was sewn onto the side where the strap would latch onto). I plan to try to repair it, cause the bag itself is very nice."
4.0,Good quality.  Good fit.  Pink color is slightly darker than picture.
4.0,They are beautiful and a greenish stone!
4.0,The high quality Persol eyeglass lens were a little small and the plastic frame seemed thicker than it appeared.  It's difficult to order frames.  I do think the Persol brand is one of the best designer frames available!
4.0,Great set of lounge wear. Also good for those who dont do costumes.
4.0,"The calves are a little tight, but overall a high quality rain boot!"
4.0,"Very nice, well made and heavy duty weight."
4.0,"This skirt is too tight.  It fits snugly all the way down to the flair.  I was expecting a slightly looser fit.  I will be giving this skirt to my niece, who will love it!  It's just not for me...<br /><br />I received this skirt at a discounted price in exchange for this honest review."
4.0,"Love that this case looks handpainted & definitely acts as a small bumper around my screen. However, there's no real coating over it. I'm sure if I scratched at it the paint would just peel off."
4.0,Glasses help with bright headlights.
4.0,"If you're looking for something unique to pair with jeans or khakis for casual outings, this traditional Chinese Henley is worth considering. The fabric (70% Cotton, 30% Linen) is light and breathable, though the Linen makes it prone to wrinkling. The cut is roomy, especially through the sleeve bottoms and waist area, but it drapes well and looks quite stylish. The fabric isn't as soft as 100% Cotton shirts, but it's comfortable enough to wear without an undershirt. The quality of the stitching is good, and I expect it to wear well. For sizing purposes, the Large fits my six-one, 175-pound frame very well, and the sleeve length seems to measure around 34 inches."
4.0,My only &#34;complaint&#34; is I wish it was lower cut.
4.0,"I've been trying to find a pair of sweats for my son who is 6'3"", however these were just too short.  Need to buy from a big and tall store."
4.0,"Its pretty much exactly as it was described. Im please with the quality, I thought considering the price that it wouldnt be as good as it is, I mean its not super high quality but its pretty decent. Its light and small, one big pocket in the middle a smaller pocket on top that pouchs out into the middle pocket and then the thin pocket at the bottom. The pocket on the strap is a little smaller than I was hoping, I can only just fit my iphone if i take off the case adn kind of force it in, i dont think its meant for phones, i think its meant for a smaller music device, it has a small hole on top for earphones. I'm pretty happy with it although like i said i would have loved if the shoulder pouch had been just a teeny tiny bit bigger."
4.0,Watch is exactly as pictured and care was taken during packaging. This is an over sized watch with good detail.
4.0,So this skirt is beautiful and would have been perfect. After reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes up with the hopes of it fitting perfectly at my waist.  I'm about 5'8 and 115lbs and I ordered a 4 I usually order a 0 or 2 in most clothes so I just knew a 4 would fit if not be a bit big.  But nope I can't even zip it all the way up.  Total bummer and since it came from China I will not be sending it back.  I will gift it to someone who is much smaller than I am .
4.0,I really like the way it fits over my thumb.
4.0,super cute!  comfy and warm.  have washed and air dried and still looks great.  didn't shrink but wish I had sized up.  it's not very oversized and the solid fabric at the top seems to make it less stretchy and a bit more fitted.
4.0,Very pretty dress although material is quite thin. It’s stretch material but you def need to wear something under it to keep all your goods from showing. But the dress is very pretty!
4.0,Looks just like pic. Arrived quickly.
4.0,"Still a good product, but not as good as the ones it replaced that lasted 10 years and were made in the USA."
4.0,"For the price, these slippers are fantastic. Too early to tell how well they will hold up, but my daughter loves them so far. Great for those chilly winter months."
4.0,"The mask fits well for a longer face. It has soft fabric. The ties are long and stretchy. Didn't like the sewn in brand name, so cut it off. You could easily cut a layer off if you can't breathe well enough."
4.0,"I absolutely loved this dress it fit everywhere except my arms, the color was perfect I was sad to have to return it."
4.0,"Bought for my friend for her birthday. Pretty and nicely made, detailed. But one of the stones is already a little loose; recommend for price and definitely as pictured"
4.0,Uncomfortable for me; due to ankle surgery!
4.0,Like the handbag but my cell phone does not fit in the cell phone pocket and it is a small iphone. Color to me is orange not brown
4.0,for our pink race coming up :)
4.0,I bought two of these one for my son and one for my daughter. They both love them and say they seem really well made and durable. My daughter loves that there is a spot for coins in it.
4.0,"Very comfortable for around the house, or even with jeans to the store. If fit just a bit too big before washing, and after one wash it does not even reach the belt line. Also if you have average to long arms the sleeves will be to short."
4.0,This is a great beach hat for a toddler. My two problems were that my 2 yr old sometimes just refuses to wear a hat and the strings are kind of long. I would have liked to see some Velcro in stead of ties but it gets hard to adjust the size
4.0,"These arrived way before they were scheduled to be delivered, which was great! They actually sent me the four pictured plus a fifth and a gemstone pendant.  They were all pretty but the only one that was real stone was the rose quartz the others were resin."
4.0,"Beautiful stones and great customer service. Only don't buy the two different colors they offer, they were almost identical. One is enought."
4.0,purchased for a friend who is undergoing Chemotherapy
4.0,"No problems, very fast service.  The quality of the watch is up to par.<br /><br />Update December 2016<br /> Croton watches are fantastic. After 8 years, my watch still looks just as great as the first date of purchase. It looks and feels much more expensive looking than what I paid. It's not available on Amazon anymore, but if you can find it somewhere else, buy it! You won't regret it."
4.0,Looks and feels great but bit too small for my Honda Pilot key!
4.0,"It's very light weight and I'm a fan of many zippered pockets in my purses, so it's great in that respect."
4.0,fits well but wish it was not so shiny.
4.0,These pants are super comfortable! I love them for that! But you’ll be disappointed if you expect tummy control!
4.0,"Love this dress and sizing is almost accurate...the only complaint I have is the neck line is very small, chokes me....I would give the 5 plus stars if it was a vnecks or scoop neck"
4.0,I ordered red wine and they are a beautiful valentine red. the strap fits comfortably and is not tight. I ordered a size 7 and it fits true to size. Notice the flowers are a lighter shade and they are not from the same dye lot of the shoe. and I will not wear them but the shoe is so pretty I will keep and enjoy them for years to come. I will be ordering a neutral shade next.
4.0,"They show in a picture a logo in back ,, but when i received without print , only front!!!"
4.0,The size was good for my skinny 8 year old. They are thin and unfortunately he has chewed holes in some. Stays up and stretch and wash well.
4.0,"This is more for a swimsuit cover up, unless you wear it with a slip underneath.  Worth the cost for the print & material."
4.0,A little cheap
4.0,It still jams some. But it is much better than the old one. It also CAN be used for cards that are slightly smaller than standard (like Skippo cards)
4.0,Does a great job and is well made.
4.0,this blouse is really cute
4.0,"I am a small and I ordered a small... it wasn’t flattering on me, although it is as pictured. Maybe on someone taller... I am 5ft, and while I could have pulled it off with some heels, I think maybe I lacked the curves to make it look flattering."
4.0,It’s nice it just is a little short.
4.0,Straps are a little weird but fits well over all. May need to pull straps up often.
4.0,Love this set!! Only complain is that the &#34;fancy&#34; piece of jewelry is HUGE and looks way too low on my face. It's definitely a chunky piece. I've been wearing the curved barbell and it's been very comfy. :)
4.0,Very sexy...satisfied
4.0,"Actually not too small -- but shorter than described. The M/L size description lists a 32&#34; inseam. My measure after washing shows barely 30&#34;  inseam.  Either major shrinkage or pants are not made to those specs. I have long legs and was looking for that couple extra inches. Otherwise, light weight cotton and a very comfortable fit for my full size 12 (woman)."
4.0,"The buttons broke, it’s not super high quality but really pretty."
4.0,"Lasts around a month each sleeve if you wear it for work.<br />I hide scars from a serious surgery from a tendon transfer after a car accident so people will stop looking at me like I tried to kill myself haha.<br />Works like intended, has cooling factor that is easily noticeable."
4.0,"So far so good, I'm using them to heal a tragus piercing,  I just pierced one last night, I will b doin the other tonight. .pleased with the first one, it's doing the job..looks pretty kinda big, but that's ok prob needs to b cz on a fresh piercing to turn it easier,  but I also made sure the bar was 10 mm to allow a lot room in case if swelling..the picture it's the top piercing not the small tunnel piercing on mY lobe, the one with the cz<br />The picture seems upside down,  again it's the cz piercing not the tunnel. The picture doesn't look positioned right it's giving u a shot from like above my head looking down..<br />Update..I pierced second tragus as shown in second photo, the second I pierced much better, the first was way to far away from my jawline, however, the bar here 10 mm just barely accomodates the intial swelling,  once intial swell reduces this bar should b fine, first picture taken the day before of first ear looked ok until I did the 2nd one correctly...if the first photo is where one would want their piercing, the bar is fine, maybe to big even for intial,  one would hv to prob go to a smaller bar after intial healing if the first photo is how one would like it..it's not bad, it's just I wanted it close to the jaw line..I may lv the hole and change out the bar here with a small hoop so my efforts don't go in vain, I can't lv it with the same bar as the 2nd photo  it would look wrong, this of course is no fault of the actual jewelry itself, I think the jewelry is fine, just maybe too small in the 10 mm if you pierce it at the jawline, it's ok, but just barely accomodates the intiAL swelling, it will b perfect for healing it I think in about a week when initial swelling goes down, i think then the 10 mm would b ideal at that point for healing, prob after healing will end up with getting a 8mm so it will b snug like it is now, so if your ear isn't bigger than average , it may work to heal as shown in second photo..if first photo is how one would like to hv their tragus pierced, one may want to go a smaller bar to heal, 8mm, then go 6mm after intial healing..<br />All in all I think the jewelry itself is fine,  one may just want to access how long of a bar they want prior to purchasing .."
4.0,Looked exactly as they were described!!!
4.0,"These are bigger than expected, I am very happy! I bought 3 of them in different colors for Christmas gifts. Can't wait to give them out!"
4.0,"Was to short, for my taste"
4.0,"WAY TOO SMALL FOR ME, ACCORDING TO THE SIZE CHART THIS SHOULD HAVE FIT PERFECTLY.  UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT, BUT I WAS ABLE TO GIVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOOKS AMAZING IN IT."
4.0,It was a great fit! A little hard to put on but worth the struggle. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the straps get very uncomfortable.
4.0,Good for the $$
4.0,"Very cute outfit but if expected to gift as a baby shower, expect the package to get to you in several weeks."
4.0,"Great quality and fit my BIG 16 month old well.  Outer shell is not water proof, but is a nylon material that repels water but allows for my daughter to move her hands easily.  Very happy with the gloves!!!"
4.0,"cute, stretchy, will last just one season"
4.0,"Cute set, but runs very small. I usually need a size small since I’m only 4’11. I gave it 4 stars though because my daughter is a size 00 or XXS at 4’9 and it fit her well."
4.0,"Love the print of the top! I wear a medium top, but this one is a little bit on the small side. I probably should've gotten a large."
4.0,A little small but great quality.
4.0,"My wife is wearing the dress. She is 5'7 and wears a size 12. The dress was a tight in the shoulders/ chest area but fit everywhere else. The material is not very soft, but not as scratchy as some synthetic materials. There is a small button at the neckline. It does prevent the neckline from opening too deep, but it does give more room in the chest/shoulders area. My wife will probably wear it open with a camisole. At least it does give option of a button, so that if it is worn with a camisole at least everyone will be able to see a bra. Overall I feel it would be more flattering for some about 5'10. I feel the end of the dress should fall at mid calf, not about an inch above the ankle."
4.0,La calidad no es muy buena pero conforme con lo recibido.
4.0,Arrived on time. Great style and fit for the cost. Ordering another pair in a different color.
4.0,Same as on picture but i wish its more thicker
4.0,Bought as a gift. Had to cut a link off to fit but my sister in law is 16 with small hands. Other than that she loved it!
4.0,Cute top. A little shorter than I would like but I will wear it.
4.0,girlfriend looks great in them!  run small.  try 1 to 2 sizes larger.
4.0,Super cute and comfy. Not for wide feet.
4.0,"Very cute top. Nice soft feel. Loose fit as expected. I'm 5'1"" 123lb and ordered small. Airy and  flowy."
4.0,Nice jeans really made my butt pop but the zipper broke the second time I wore them so I’ll have to sew  a new one in
4.0,I thought it was a black but I got a navy blue. My size is US Medium but I ordered L and it fits. No regrets whatsoever. It looks like the product will last for some time.
4.0,These shoes are pretty and glittery but definitely are on the small side and narrow too. We ended up sending them back since they barely fit.
4.0,Well made. Love it. I plan to buy more.
4.0,I love the blanket although it is rather thin. Not really what I expected. I prolly wouldn't buy it again after having it.
4.0,"I'm a curvy thick woman, especially in the butt and thigh so they are a bit snug on me but they also provide some tummy control for me.  So if you got a lot of junk in the trunk size up but overall happy with them!"
4.0,Fits like a tight stretchy T-shirt. The only complaint is the length of the shirt.
4.0,Love it it fits so perfectly feels very nice the craftsmanship is perfect no doubt I'll get a lot of wear out of it
4.0,"Gave a 4 star simply because, though they are nicer, in the sense that they are perfect in shape and size when compared to the clear &#34;glass&#34; pebbles bought at the craft store, they are pretty spendy for that slight difference. They do do a nice job magnifying the image below. The diamond glaze works really well with them. They are lighter in weight compared to the glass pebble ones. They seem more plastic-resin than glass, as they aren't very easy to clean to get the finger prints and package dust off. Another reason for lack of 5-stars. They were quite dirty for a new package of product."
4.0,Fit well a bit tight around the groin area when seated
4.0,"Beautiful, however I am apparently allergic to them as my neck and lobes swelled and got weepy. Fyi."
4.0,"Soft and cozy.<br />And you never have to worry about this kind of style slipping off of your neck.<br />It doesn't shed. Two different types of synthetic fiber give a two toned look.<br />Not a high end accessory, but looks ok and does the job of keeping you warm."
4.0,The necklace itself is nice and a good lenght but it is very easy to bend and easy to break but if you wear it around you neck and dont mess with it will last a good while mine lasted about 10 month's before the snakes head broke off .<br />So it is really a COSTUME piece and not for jewelry us.
4.0,The dress fits PERFECT!  My ONLY complaint is that it is VERY wrinkled!  Will try to get the wrinkles out tomorrow as I am planning to wear this dress for my son's high school graduation!  Word of caution though.....if you buy this dress it is heavier......it is NOT recommended for a warm weather garden party event (or an out door wedding where it is very warm).  Love it other wise!  :D
4.0,"Love the dress. Looks adorable on. BUT it did shrink after one washing. I was disappointed, but it wasn't a big deal because I have 2 daughters close in age; it then fit my younger one perfect."
4.0,"The glasses are exactly what I would expect for the price.  They are not high quality.  The glasses make good inexpensive readers. The reflective coating is purple.  I can tell that the screen brightness is decreased when I'm wearing the glasses, but I haven't noticed significant improvement in (decreased) eye strain. When I remove the glasses after wearing them for several consecutive hours everything seems to have a purplish hue that goes away after awhile."
4.0,I like this bracelet a lot and I don’t regret buying it I had no issues with it except that when you make it smaller/readjusted it there or the strings that are hanging out of it which make it less appealing. This is not a big issue but just thought that other people should know in case they do not like the look of that before they buy it.
4.0,"I ordered a large but needed an X-Large as the top fit a little tight, but the bottom fits nicely. It would be nice if I was able to pick a different size for the top rather than having to order a second one to get the top in a bigger size. The bottom stretch but the top does not."
4.0,"I wear a 34D (with breast reduction) and this fits just right. I would usually remove the pads, but there's really not much support so I have left them in. It's pretty much a fitted ""tank top"" that's great for hanging out, gardening or whatever. If you sweat? The bra will be damp and stay that way. It's not at all cooling. As others have said; not much stretch, so it may not work for many.  It's a decent casual lounge-wear bra."
4.0,Wonderful top. Beautiful pastel pink.  Good weight fabric.
4.0,"Good quality and works as well as the ones made my Fitbit.  The only drawback is, unlike the Fitbit band, it does not have a two position adjustment on the band's latch that allows a half link adjustment.  Of course this will not affect everyone."
4.0,"This is a really cute dress, although it is a little short.  It can also be worn with leggings. Be sure to by 1 size up like it says. this is not a tight fitting dress, although like a loose T-shirt type. good quality. You do have to place the safety pins on yourself which I think is a good idea so you can get them lined up where you want them. over all good quality and cute dress to wear just about anywhere.<br />My measurements for reference- 171lbs, 5 &#34;8&#34;, 38 DD  I purchased an X Large"
4.0,"Decent Star-Trek shirt.  However, BE SURE to order one size larger than you normally wear."
4.0,These look great! These are now one of my favorite pair they fit super. High waist doesn’t roll down. I have the dark green and it’s actually very pretty with a black top. Would like to buy other colors. Love them
4.0,It is starting to break down a bit.
4.0,"Soft, fuzzy fabric."
4.0,Not as flattering as the picture
4.0,"My cheating ex got these for me before we broke up, lol thanx bioootchhhhh😁. On a serious note, the light blue ones I had broke in one use but I guess you get what you pay for lol and for the price it wasn't bad at all."
4.0,"This is a really soft, comfortable shirt.  The sleeves are a nice stretchy fabric somewhat resembling pajama fabric- they have a slight sheen to them.  I was pretty disappointed with the color of the Santa hat though.  It looked sparkly in the picture, but it wasn't at all sparkly.  The red didn't even match the bright red in the stripes on the sleeves.  It was very dull and  I had to use red fabric paint to cover it.  Once I doctored it up, it looked much better.  If the hat color wasn't so ugly I would have given this shirt five stars."
4.0,"First of all the product is exactly as described and looks really good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the loop to hang it from the mirror is pretty small and with the mirror in my truck (Silverado) it was basically pinned against the bottom of the mirror stem and looked awkward the way it sat. Easy fix, I picked up a simple chain from Walmart (like on dog tags or a ceiling fan string) and cut it down to get it to hang where I want it. Just looped it through the existing nylon and was done with it. Overall good product that adds a little personalization to my truck."
4.0,Its something for me to carry around till I find the person I want to convey this message to. And then It will be just perfect
4.0,"I love them, the pendants are big enough and not heavy at all."
4.0,Did not wash well (faded quickly) but was a cute dress for our Easter Egg hunt.
4.0,I got these for my boyfriend and they’re a little long but he just rolls the waistband. The fabric is thin but comfy which is perfect for him. It has pockets which carry his cell phone well.
4.0,"This garment runs very small, I am 5'8&#34; tall and 130 pounds, and usually wear a size 8.  This coat would not be wearable by anyone larger than me.  Quality is good, the fabric is nice and I like the lining.  I wish it was just a little larger so I could wear with a bulkier sweater."
4.0,I like this hat because I have very long dreadlocks and they got perfectly under
4.0,"Tight fit for cards, but it is a gorgeous color (teal) and snaps shut well."
4.0,I'm smaller than the average bear
4.0,Runs a bit small but works as intended
4.0,So cute for teens and tweens. If it were a little bigger they would make great anklets.
4.0,"They fit nice and are very comfortable, but not very warm. I still need another pair of thick socks in my hunting boots."
4.0,This bracelet is beautiful!  The only issue is with one of the &#34;arms&#34; on the clasp.  It doesn't stay closed.  I used a tweezer to squeeze it slightly and now it stays closed!  I did not want to return it.<br /><br />Other than that issue - I love the bracelet.
4.0,I think she liked it very much! and would order another if I needed to. Thanks a bunch and God Bless you!
4.0,"These help my legs so much but I have the hardest time putting them on!!!  I guess if they had more stretch, they wouldn't do such a good job."
4.0,"I use a lot of gloves in food prep. Because the nitrile gloves are so hard to find during the Covid shortages, I am saving them and using these gloves in the kitchen. Work great."
4.0,"Beautiful purse. I love the color and the size is great. Not too big, not too small and lots of pockets. It is stiffer leather, but I like that about it.<br /><br />Definitely a shoulder strap, not a cross body bag. The strap is not long enough to be used as both, so if youre looking for a longer strap, you will either have to buy one or just go with a different purse. Especially if youre tall. Which is why I'm giving it 4 stars because even for a shoulder bag, its rather small for me. (Im 5'9&#34;)"
4.0,"Good boxers, but don't really stretch much. Still great and comfy"
4.0,"Quality is very good. However if they have photo ID display room , I ll give 5 stars"
4.0,"Just opened mine and the colors are so vibrant! I got 3 industrial bars, some nipple and tongue bars, spirals, horshoes, and even a little nose stud! I would post pics but I already mixed it in with my other jewelry ^^ I would totally buy again is a great selection! Just hoping the metal is legit and colored pieces are actually anodized. Wish I got some I saw in the picture but it is random!!"
4.0,Really good monroe rings..everything that it said it was going to be. If your lip is a little bigger it's best to go with a different post that fixs you.
4.0,"i love this piece, it's not big or bulky & is not masculine looking, but it does catch in my hair a little like other designs do. But very fair price for good product."
4.0,"They look decent but not amazing, can't stand the band that you use to keep it on. I have bought better looking ones but couldn't see very well out of them, these don't have that problem"
4.0,Costume accessory. Just right.
4.0,Detail wasn't great!
4.0,Not for tall people the torso area is short
4.0,Love these but theyre huge for just  a medium and  they faded super quick
4.0,"I bought this for my niece. She loved it , it’s very eye catching. It even comes in a gift box so they feel like they got an amazing expensive gift."
4.0,"These were exactly what I was looking for. For one of my jobs I generally use stud earrings that are larger than the gauged holes in my earlobes with the large clear, plastic circular backs and have complete coverage. Occasionally though, a stud will fall out. I purchased these plugs to insert the studs into before putting them into my ear lobes. I had to make a minor adjustment, removing one of the flared ends with a razor blade, but now they fit perfect and flush with the surface of my ear. They are comfortable enough to sleep in as well. The color of the silicone is light, but once I inserted the earring stud the silicone is no longer visible anyway. If ave 4 instead of 5 stars due to how long the plugs are and the need for adjustment. I still feel they are a great value and they met my needs."
4.0,"Very cute, but also very tiny. They fit my 4 year and, barely, my 6 year old but they don't fit over the mouths and nose of my 9 year old."
4.0,Heavy material but shrunk after washing
4.0,"Looked at a lot of umbrellas before purchasing this and it’s just what I expected. THE GOOD:<br />Good quality that has performed well. Four 20 inch pavers fit in base perfectly giving it excellent stability. Tilt adjustable to move with<br />the time of day. Love the winter cover too.<br />THE BAD:<br />I read negative reviews about the umbrella not staying open. Have used this for a couple months. The crank that opens and umbrella did not ingage the gears to hold umbrella in place once. Fashioned a short rope to hold crank in place for that reason but have only had to used it once. Overall, happy with this."
4.0,I really liked the combination on cross body colors and just the right size.
4.0,El diseno hermoso pero la tela 2 3 labadas y esta vien Canada pero por el precio me gusta
4.0,most comfortable in this Florida heat.
4.0,The gloves are exactly how described.  I love them and may be ordering additional ones as gifts.
4.0,"Bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it, the only complaint is, the links are hard to remove."
4.0,"Although they were fairly comfortable, the elastic waist band had something to be desired!  Very thin elastic and it was kind of tight, not bad enough to cause issues but for me not the greatest.  I will not rebuy."
4.0,All rasco frc clothing runs small so order 1 up from the size u would normally get and DO NOT DRY or it will shrink..they have very fast shipping i have bought several several items from rascco over $300 plus i went to the store and spend $200 so they have great clothes you just cant dry them or they shrink
4.0,"For the price the bag is nice. I like that it folds into itself. The zipper could be sturdier for a bag of this size, which is why I took off a star. It split open a couple times, but is correctable. Not bad as a back up, carry on bag for travel purchases or quick weekend trips, especially if you don't have space to store bulky luggage.  It can't really be stuffed or overloaded though due to the zipper."
4.0,Very nice long dress with a slit up side. I ordered the small and was very tight med fits good. Great for a night out with husband.
4.0,"These are huge but so awesome for cosplay!  The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because some black paint had been chipped off in shipment I assume. We just covered it in black nail polish. They look real which I love. Not cheap plastic.<br />*My daughter has a little nose, and these hold up perfect on her.<br />*Wig in another review."
4.0,"Everyone stated it was too small, I disagree. I got it for a girlfriend, (medium), she's tiny with a very big rack (huge) but the small would have fit better and showed off more."
4.0,Little one don't fit many really small
4.0,I’m 5’4” and they fit great for my short legs.
4.0,"Purchased in size 5T<br /><br />The good:<br />* costume colors are accurate<br />* costume pattern is accurate<br />* many accessories included<br /><br />The bad:<br />* the neck of the costume was far too small to fit my daughter's head. I had to cut a slit in the front (through the sailor collar and part of the bodysuit) and re-hem by hand<br /><br />* The gloves are poorly proportioned for a young child. The fingers are extremely skinny and overly long. You can wrestle fingers into them, but it's hard to avoid an inch or so of floppy fingertips hanging off<br /><br />* the ""boot"" socks don't stay up well and will likely need to be re-hemmed narrower<br /><br />Other than the gloves (which are workable as-is, if slightly silly) the costume is great with minor modifications. However, considering it was literally unwearable as shipped, I can't give it 5 stars"
4.0,I like the length of these shorts at 5’4” they fit right above my knees. A little too wide for my skinny legs but I wore them and enjoyed summer!
4.0,Very nice and classy. Designs are beautiful
4.0,My wife loves these.  She has worn them a lot already.
4.0,Para manejar.
4.0,"A bit gaudier than it appears online. Nonetheless, works well and is comfortable."
4.0,"I love these stretchers! The only problem I have with them is I had to boil them so the plastic didn’t fall off. Other than that, these are great for beginners or people like me restretching!"
4.0,So soft. I love these PJs!
4.0,This watch is really a strong and durable watch.
4.0,"I have a very hard time finding pants, one I'm tall 5'10&#34; with long legs I need usually a 36&#34; or more inseam to sit without socks showing. 2 I recently had abdominal surgery and have chronic pain in that area and can not do tight buttons on jeans. These have worked pretty well so far, they are very stretchy, ok length could be a little longer for my taste but work, they have a draw string hidden inside the waist that I found I needed as they did start to slip down as wore them. I had to wash them for a long time with extra rise with a color catcher sheet as they were very smelly and made me itchy just trying them on. They did bleed a lot in the wash, I had the black color. I guess by the end of the day they were a bit saggy in the butt, I however do not have any butt so that's pretty typical for me. I will keep wearing them before I decide if I would order another pair."
4.0,Like then very much..I ordered larger size and added a pair of suspenders.. Love the material... Only thing.. Not waterproof at all...I metal detecting and my knees get wet....
4.0,Great pattern but ear loops are too small had to sew my own on.
4.0,"Fits nicely, flattering, good material"
4.0,"If you just want a thin sweatshirt, this is perfect for you. It says it has the UV protection which is very nice. However, I typically wear a medium, so I ordered that size sweatshirt, but it runs small. The zipper isn’t the nicest quality on the pockets either so I was hesitant to put anything inside. Overall a decent jacket for the price and what you get."
4.0,"These socks do a great job of keeping my feet drier and cushioning my 2-4 miles of daily walking easier.  They do increase the functional diameter of the foot, so if your shoes are already firm/tight, then this could cause problems.  What I worked in to as comfortable shoes, I had to re-break in for a couple weeks to accommodate the extra space.  Work great."
4.0,Hangs and flows nicely. Great for travel.
4.0,"Overall okay for crafting, but not the best. There’s a few Halloween/fall pieces in there that I can’t use right now. Detail is there and a few are heavy. I will have to see how they stain and take the embossing powder. I can use 41 out of the 50 I received on my Christmas projects. A few might be too thick to mail so if you need them for card charms these charms aren’t flat. Overall good purchase."
4.0,"This review is for the Outdoor Alchemist 5 Pack Ponchos with Sleeves and Hood, One Size Fits All sold by The Attic Alchemist. I chose this variety of rain ponchos for my teen kids. I like that is has five different colors so they were able to select the one they wanted. The length is pretty long and can be worn while they are wearing their backpacks underneath. I did not like that they are so thin, but so far they are holding up and have not torn. They each came in their own individual pack so my kids can keep them in their backpacks in case of rain. The hoods on the ponchos are spacious and cover their whole heads as well. If I need to reorder ponchos for any reason I will be rebuying these."
4.0,I ordered 2 set's.  A set for my 4 yr old granddaughter (for later) and a set for me. She is thrilled and can't wait til she can wear them. I always get compliments when I wear them. People get such a kick out of them. I always welcome the laughter!!!
4.0,Very nice top.  Fitted-soft and warm.  Lightweight-has kangaroo pocket for hands in front.  Good quality-may pill in time-more synthetic than cotton. nice floral colors on sleeves and hood.
4.0,I got this for a friend who goes fishing but I tried it on and it feels very soft and warm'
4.0,"We ordered this bag as my husband was looking for something to replace his full sized satchel. He works for the Forest Service and wants to be able to carry more than he can fit in his pockets, but has little need for a full sized bag. In this respect, the size is perfect. He is able to carry his wallet, an 8 inch tablet, his smart phone, spare battery, his work phone, a small flashlight, his multi-tool, cigarettes, lighter and his stop smoking aides (lol), keys, work gloves, a few other small sundries without the bag looking overwhelmingly full. The photos attached (of the bag full) are from after nearly 3 full weeks of use, they show the items that are in the bag and how they fit in, just to give you an idea of the capacity.<br /><br />The bag has a flap over the front that uses magnetic snaps for closure. Under the flap there is a flat open pocket (slide in a notebook and pen, perhaps?) attached to a slightly larger zipper pocket. This zipper pocket is attached to the man portion of the bag, which is the largest of the pockets. This pocket has fabric and a drawstring to keep your items secure. On each side of the bag you'll find a small mesh pocket and on one side is a very small pocket with a flap and button.<br /><br />From a construction standpoint, the bag seems to be well made. The canvas fabric is nice and thick, all of the stitching is solid and all of the buckles, leather and straps are firmly attached. In the weeks we've had it, it has been used daily, taken into the forest, tossed into trucks, dropped on the ground and is holding up very well so far.<br /><br />There are a couple of things that I might change about this bag if given the opportunity. Probably most notable being the side pocket. It is quite small. Not nearly large enough for a smart phone. It works for us because the work phone being used in there is an older style phone (think small flip) but if I were relying on that space to hold my smartphone, I'd be disappointed. Additionally, I'd like to see the buckles used as actual buckles rather than as decor. The magnetic snaps are working fantastically, but I could see the buckles potentially lasting longer.<br /><br />All in all I'd recommend this bag and would certainly buy it again if we found ourselves in need of something similarly sized."
4.0,"Love this necklace! Have gotten so many compliments on it too!<br /><br />Bought two, they’ve officially just both broke. Makes me so sad."
4.0,"Very nice sweatshirt. Be sure to wash it before wearing. All the lint got stuck on my light blue shirt and looked really bad. Othet than that, very comfortable sweatshirt."
4.0,"This product does look a bit like the image, however the fabric is weird and clings to every chunk of fat I have so I returned it. However, you could make it work if you were willing to wear a slip underneath, I however am not. It was true to size also."
4.0,"Washed and tried on, but not to go out. I like the oversize look, but this one would have been ok in small."
4.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is such a cute basic top.  It goes with just about anything.  Since the description said that it is form-fitting I went a size up from my usual size and I'm glad I did.  My regular size would have been too snug for my liking.  The shape is feminine and flattering.  The fabric is stretchy and comfortable.  I love the ""Saint Patrick's Day Shamrock Green"" color I got."
4.0,belt is the perfect accessory to many ourfits.<br />Delivery was prompt and looked like the picture very pleased.
4.0,Fits perfectly & is comfortable.
4.0,A little bigger than I expected and a bit heavy. Cute though. Can't beat the price. Shipping took so long I forgot I ordered it.
4.0,They are just a bit too small as the heel  has a tendency to slide down into the shoe(not a lot)  I wear a 10 shoe .
4.0,Very functional purse. Soft. Good size. Happy with my purchase
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my niece who is obsessed with Japanese culture. The quality looked great and the necklace was a good length. My niece couldn’t have cared less, though. I still think it’s cool."
4.0,"UPDATE** I got a XXL. I'm 5'3 180 lbs size 10 jeans.. this was huge. I normally would of chose an XL to &#34;size up&#34; but everyone complained of Asian sizes so I went up 2 sizes. DONT DO IT.<br />Negatives: Chest was too long(my boobs had 2-3 inches of material underneath), so much room in the stomach area, and the mermaid tail was dragging on the floor.<br />Positives: material is super soft, zipper doesn't catch, back of mermaid tail is slightly longer and not overdone(sometimes it looks weird if it's too long), grey color is very light- identical to picture,<br /><br />XXL would fit someone who is taller than 5'5 OR wearing stripper heels if they are short. Dress came on time and in neat packaging. Just the sizing was WAY off for me personally. 4 stars due to sizing issue but overall I have no major complaints.<br />**The pictures show how much I had to get it altered. She took an inch of the chest, 1 inch on each side so 2 inches total down the whole torso and hemmed the tail so it wouldn't drag."
4.0,Not bad. The mechanism that holds it all together seems a bit large but they do serve my purpose.
4.0,Necklace is absolutely beautiful! Just as pictured but the chain isn't very long!
4.0,"Cute and comfy, but the neckline is a little weird. Still wearable though!"
4.0,I like the  clearer vision but the fit is not as good as my old one.  They leave a bit too much space  on top tp leave in light. Great with a nat or visor. But still the best singlasses around
4.0,"Just received it and it's very cute... although it took longer than it was supposed to, my daughter loved it"
4.0,Great! Just wish the black part wasnt as long (I cut it)
4.0,My butt felt great after my ride but I had to keep pulling them down so that was disappointing. Would recommend though to save your ass 😂
4.0,So comfy. Love it! One of my favorite dresses.
4.0,I like this dress. Does not look exactly like picture due to material but still nice.
4.0,I attached this case to my cross body wallet. Now I can wear my sunglasses and still have my prescription clear glasses at the ready. Very convenient. This case runs a little small so perfect for glasses of average size. Larger framed glasses may not fit. I preferred the smaller case because it is not as bulky when attached to my cross body.
4.0,"I hate shoelaces.  These work in my &#34;work&#34; shoes and look good.  They are a little fiddly to install, and I actually tried to remove a set from some old shoes so that I could reuse them, and gave up after about 5 minutes and ordered another set.  I had used the old set for a couple of years with no problems, so they seem pretty solidly made, which is unsurprising for a piece of rubber."
4.0,The watch is great but the one I ordered what's different from the one I got. It was dark silver the one I ordered was supposed to be black. Still a great watch.
4.0,The only issue was the fact that the buttons were too far back for my mask.
4.0,Good quality mask but did not show up in time for my event. I ended up buying a 2 pair of black knee high tights and sewed them together as i needed a face covering. Im sure it would have worked even better but like i said i did not receive it in time....the pictures shown is not with THIS mask underneath the Stormtrooper and Reaper mask but if so it would have the same effect....Good quality just didn't show up in time so that was a bummer :(
4.0,They make a very satisfying low pitch jingle noise when they touch. The fall back to a perfect angle when your arm is flat on a surface so they don’t interfere when you are typing. The colors compliment each other and look good with my skin tone. They are not soldered together that well but you don’t really notice that when they are all next to each other.
4.0,Sexy without showing too much. Fit perfectly.
4.0,It looks super cool! Came a bit smaller then I thought but that's alright. The side part came broken off but nothing a little glue wont fix.
4.0,"Very light material and seems to be put together well. The fit is slightly snugged comparing to other brands of the same size, so if you have thick thigh /legs, you may want to reconsider."
4.0,As described.  Came with nive gift box. Beautiful!!!!!
4.0,"I really like this necklace. I wanted to find a direwolf sigil pendant, but the other ones looked weird around the face/eye area. This one is perfect. And it faces the right direction. The back side says &#34;Winter is Coming.&#34; The chain is nothing fancy - literally just a chain with a clasp on only one end, but it works fine. The pendant is heavier than most, heavier than I expected, but the quality is good for  this  kind  of costume  jewelry, and better than a lot of the other direwolf pieces I have seen."
4.0,Sizes are irregular. I ordered 3 dresses all 3 fit differently. Otherwise nice casual dress. Fabric a bit thicker than a t-shirt. I am a 14 ordered xl. One fit
4.0,Really pretty...wish I could stretch them just a bit!
4.0,It's prefect it has one side for the cards and not only that the phone fits good I don't need to be putin it on my back packet or bein diggin in my pures.
4.0,"Nice dress...What I needed, but I ordered a small and got an XL"
4.0,Such a pretty necklace. Not as long as I would have liked but can you really complain with the price being so low.
4.0,granddughter loves them
4.0,difficult to clasp otherwise would have rated 5 of 5
4.0,"I really like this band, I get many compliments for it.  It reminds me of a Skagen watch I had years ago.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the clasp can be a little clunky at times and hard to fully engage, otherwise it's great."
4.0,"These socks are a pain in the tush to get on.  And to take off.  But when they are on, they are great.  They have enough compression to make my legs feel good all day long.  And they are cute, not like those tannish compression stockings that are needed after surgery sometimes.  These just look like sturdy long athletic socks.<br /><br />The size I got are listed as S/M.  I normally wear a size 7 1/2 shoe.  The foot of these was actually a bit big for my foot.  I had to smooth them out so there wouldn't be a wrinkle on my foot that would become annoying when I walk a lot.  I think if you have small feet, this might be a problem, but for my 7 1/2 feet, it was just something to be aware of."
4.0,"Used them at my wedding for myself and all guys in the wedding. The cufflinks themselves are really good quality.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the box (while looking really cool) doesn't have a lid that will stay on. To fix this, I just wrapped a bow around the box which worked really well."
4.0,Very Nice Blazer
4.0,"The &#34;loved beyond words,missed beyond measure&#34; bracelet arrived quickly via two day prime shipping.  It came with a small velvet storage bag that also would make a nice presentation for giving the bracelet as a gift.  The leather cord that the charm is on is easy to get on and off one's wrist via the clasp latch.  The stamped charm seems well made.  It is a decent thickness and the message is clearly stamped.  There aren't any rough edges or any other flaws with the piece.  The piece looks like the product photos.<br />I actually intend to take the stamped charm off of the leather bracelet that it comes on and use it as a charm on some beaded bracelets with clasps on both ends that I already own.  The bracelets belonged to my aunt who recently passed away and this seemed like the a nice memorial message to wear with them."
4.0,"Loved this dress. I wore  it to work and received many compliments. I'm 5'2'' 150 lbs. The dress came to just below my knees, however it was still very tasteful. Oh one tip, it is very fitting so please be careful as to what kind of panties you put on ladies."
4.0,Nice fit. Did not like pockets. Material is thin and pockets are sticking out. I asked my friend to cut them out. Can dress it up with some jewelry.
4.0,"Although not the highest of quality, it was a great price and is comfortable and beautiful."
4.0,Very sexy but casual dress fit perfect
4.0,Very pretty.  Work of art. Love it
4.0,Soft and love the color! Length makes it easy to wrap.
4.0,"These gloves worked perfectly for the Rikku cosplay that I was doing. The hand part fit perfectly, but the wrist was a little too big. Good quality."
4.0,It's likes in that model for a litte bit large  but that's right for me
4.0,These sleeves are great albeit a bit tight making them hard to pull on
4.0,"I took the advise of other posts and ordered the 3x. I am 5'5 180 and the pants fit perfect. That being said, the pants are just what I wanted. They are very comfortable and the material feels silky. I love them!"
4.0,Love the bottoms on this suit! I bought 3 different colors. It is extremely flattering for those that wanna cover up the belly area. ( I've got stretch marks from my babies )  Surprisingly very good quality for its price. Only reason I gave it a 4 star due to the top being small for larger breasted women like myself ( 32D) . I normally wear a size 0 so I went with a small.  Overall a great buy and will definitely buy again!
4.0,this pack was all i hoped for except the front pockets on the straps. They won't carry a cell phone (unless you have a tiny flip phone) not sun glasses (without damage putting them in the pocket).
4.0,Love it very comfortable.
4.0,"Correct Color, looks very cute, just not the most comfortable shoe ever. I can wear them for a few hours, but they're not meant for walking long distances."
4.0,It's really awesome.
4.0,Love the style but it fits like a shirt.  I'm 5&#34;4 and 180lbs.  I carry my weight in my boobs and butt so it's a little tight and small.  But I will definitely be wearing it over my swim suit or over a tank!
4.0,These are perfect for what we needed. Will purchase more soon :)
4.0,Decent wallet for it's price and nice little everyday gift.
4.0,NORMAL
4.0,I love the looks of the boots but I have wide feet so I could use a size up because they are very narrow so you should buy a size up for sure they are built vary well!
4.0,"Cute, sexy, holds my small number of cards and what little cash I ever carry. Definitely not for those with multiple credit cards and whatever other crap people cram into their wallets."
4.0,It is a bit stiff and hard to grab much from the middle/ main area *wish it was able to expand a little bit more.  It is very cute and I love using it as a back pack purse. I often use the little clutch handle as well. I like how different it is than most back pack purses.
4.0,"This was a great buy! Super inexpensive and I think my money was well-worth it! The quality, sure is not the greatest, but hey it does the job. Fortunately, no glitter has come off and the band is holding up pretty well. I wore this to my pep rally at school and enjoyed the look of it on me. :)"
4.0,The style was as expected but the material wasn’t. It was more of silky light material and was thinking it was going to be different. But it’s cute. I do think it runs a bit large. Does not seem like it will shrink.
4.0,I'm sure it will look good on others but not so much on me. It has always being difficult for me to find the right pair of sunglasses.
4.0,"I dislike the smell.  What kind of leather is this.  Not sure which part is giving off that smell.  I only just received my boots today (a few hours ago).  I can not evaluate the water resistance of this product yet.  The color (red) is beautiful and so is the fit.  They are soft yet they feel sturdy.  Other than the smell, I love them.<br />Hopefully that chemical smell will dissipate soon.  I'm going to give it a week."
4.0,I ordered and gave to my mom as a birthday present.
4.0,"The blouse you site is burgundy since you received the other 3 why wouldn't you have gotten this one as well... I know that I ordered 4 blouses, and returned 4 (al)l of the blouse that I ordered at the same time around the last of August!  None of them fit...so if you have billed me again for these please refund the charge. Further questions please call me at 316 618-5151."
4.0,"I love the material - it's nice and soft and silky and drapes well on the body. The armholes are PERFECT - big enough but not so big that your entire side shows. The only thing is I wish it were a little longer. It hits me just below the waist and I am not a tall person (5'2"", got size Medium). I was hoping it would fit closer to hip level, more like in the picture. If they made this exact shirt in a slightly longer style I would buy it in every color - it's so comfortable and awesome to work out in."
4.0,This case is what I needed to carry my macbook pro in style.The outside of the case is nice but it is not leather but it has a nice texture to it although<br />a little rigid but the inside has pockets and sleeves to put your extra accessories or paper also there are  straps to hold your laptop in place but I wish the velcro on the straps were little longer for a tighter fit but it gets the job done and also there will be a strong smell for about three weeks until it subsides but this is a winner in my book with few flaws.
4.0,Nice boots overall
4.0,"These are exactly like you would expect them to be except in my case a little small. If they were for me it would be the perfect size but for my husband (it was a gift), they are a bit too small. It woudl really help if there was a better description to let you know the size or picture them next to something to show scale."
4.0,"I love it,it's just as it is seen in the app,material is very thick,overall it a lovely skirt"
4.0,"I received these today and while they are pretty comfortable they run a little small and wish they would come in bigger sizes.. I ordered an XL and they fit well just a little short, one size up probably would of been a lot better, but I just bought them to wear over my bathing suit anyhow. Also they came 3 weeks earlier than expected ;)"
4.0,Super cute but heavy
4.0,"Love this dress, I purchased an xsmall and it fits perfectly and is the perfect length."
4.0,I bought this dress in white. I purchased a medium. I am 5'9&#34; and 165 lbs. The dress fit as to be expected. The material is somewhat thick but with any white fabrics certain undergarments will show underneath. The dress is &#34;lined&#34; only at the top and depending on the size of your bust just covers your breast or the bottom of the lining will cut across them. I put lined in quotations because it's really just excess fabric that is folded down. It's quite noticeable because the rest of the dress isn't &#34;lined&#34;. Throughout the night I had to keep adjusting the &#34;lining&#34; so that it wouldn't cut at an awkward place but sometimes it was unavoidable. I don't know how this &#34;lining&#34; looks on other color dresses. Because the cut of the dress is so cute and flattering I'm going to see if I can get the excess fabric removed or find an all white body shaper to wear underneath it.
4.0,"Nice dress for what you pay! I am 5’11 180 lbs I bought the XL, it fits nicely but I probably could have went with a large. The dress is on the longer side, it came to my mid thighs.  Overall great dress. Comfortable with nice stretch. Bought for a Wednesday Addams costume but honestly will wear this with my normal wardrobe!"
4.0,"The fabric was good quality, with a snug upright t-neck. Some previous reviewers had mentioned that the fabric was thin & see-thru, with a slouchy turtle-neck. Mine was not. But the sizing seems to run small. I am tall and trim, and usually would have ordered a size Medium, but due to some reviews, I ordered a Large. It was still snug and a bit shorter than usual. I would have returned it for a larger size but they did not have the color I wanted in the X-LG, so I kept it, and will wear it anyway. I took off a star for sizing issue."
4.0,Very long I’m 5’4  and it’s way long I’m chubby so thought xl would be right no I think they just make them longer not wider other than that they fit
4.0,"To big for a woman's hands, I gave them to my boyfriend. But nice gloves otherwise"
4.0,The outfit is perfect beautiful that's what I like about it the most I wear a medium I had to get a large perfect fit the least I like about it is that it's not Pure White there is a hint of off-white but other than that beautiful I was just a little disappointed but I guess it will pass hopefully lol
4.0,could a be a little more firm.
4.0,Fit as expected but far too long & hard to shorten.
4.0,"The pants are extremely comfortable and have side pockets. My only complaint is that for the waist size I needed, they are slightly long. However that can easily be fixed with some quick sewing. All in all a fantastic pair of lounge pants."
4.0,Very cute suit. Looks just like the photo. Crochet fabric is a little loose on the overlay parts but I still love it.
4.0,"The quality used to be better because the belt was thicker, now (via the last belt I ordered) the material used to make it is thinner. The length and width are perfect. Good closure. However, the thinner the material the more it twist and needs constant adjustment while wearing around the closure after wearing for a while unless you stand the entire time. The colors are deep and rich. No fraying. I hope the maker goes back to the thicker material."
4.0,"My 16 year old daughter loves this beanie and wears it around all the time, even in the house.  It seems to be good quality, and the reverse option is handy if you want a different look.  She LOVES it!  As well, kuddos to the seller.  The hat didn't show up close to Christmas time, and they super rushed another one to me so she would have it in time for Christmas.  They trusted me enough to send the other one back when it came.  And it did eventually come, and I did ship it back.  Thanks guys!"
4.0,"Color is beautifully vibrant and the fabric is smooth.  I took one star off is because there is no shoulder vest in the package.  Description clearly stated swimdress, underwear and shoulder belt vest.  Other than that, everything is exactly as described on Amazon."
4.0,Warm and toasty my friends loves it
4.0,"I am always wary of buying sunglasses online because I have a large face, and it's hard to tell if the sunglasses will be too big, too small or just right. I am so glad that theses glasses fit my  face.<br /><br />These sunglasses arrived in a microfiber bag, wrapped in bubble wrap, and inside if a soft padded envelope. These glasses are quite delicate, and perhaps there would need to be more padding or precautions taken to make sure that they do not get damaged during shipment.<br /><br />I am somewhat of a sunglasses collector, so I am glad I add these to the collection!<br /><br />My only complaint: they are a bit fragile. They are easily bendable and I will definitely be mindful of that when I wear them.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,I bought that black halter neck bodysuit in an XL in black( I ordered according to my pants size) and it fit perfectly.There are snaps at the bottom and it is secured with an extra bit of tougher fabric so they probably wont just tear off in the washing machine or something. Also It is not as low cut as it seems in the picture I showed only the top part of cleavage when I had it on. My only issue is the fact that it is a bit see through so Im worried flash photography could be an issue in this. But it is still really cute.
4.0,"This dress is super comfy and looks cute! It is not as long as I had hoped or as pictured, and I do wish it didn't have ""hippy soul"" on it, but otherwise I'm very happy with it! Color is true to picture. (Blue) I got a medium, am 5'5"" & 155lbs."
4.0,"while the sleeping beauty costume dress comes with a little gold crown, nothing makes a little girl's face light up more than a beautiful tiara. i should have bought the shoes as well...."
4.0,It's cute enough - runs a little small and the fabric is kinda cheap but it works for an everyday kind of dress
4.0,"Good for very bright day but for driving. Sides allow bright light in when out of car, distracting"
4.0,"For some reason Amazon is asking me to rate this product as a shoe. Anyhow, the leather case is great! Looks amazing and perhaps the only BUT i have is that it is a little too large for my key. Makes my key bulky but i like the protection and appearance it gives."
4.0,"I had a pair of these sun glasses before. If you don't care about brands, these glasses do what their suppose to do but also very sturdy. I ran 3 Spartan Races to avoid mud in my eyes, they're real cool glasses ."
4.0,Great product and it is held together well. It is comfortable and the design looks great. You also can save your eyes because there is no fuzzy on the mask like the cheap ones<br /> Also stays well don't rise into your eyes
4.0,"This dress was cute but fit me a little to big.  I normally wear a large in dresses but this didn't compliment my figure like I'd envisioned.  Baggy/Loose is the style so if you want it to be a little fit, I'd say order a size down."
4.0,"This crystal I was purchased as a gift, my associate said she really liked this item."
4.0,"Cute, fluffy, but not big enough"
4.0,What a great sweater for the price!  I sized up one size because I'm tall and have long arms.  I'm glad I did because the sleeves hit me just right.
4.0,You can barely set the time to the current time but its cool other than that.
4.0,"Wanted to love these! They were so beautiful and just like the picture. Sadly, my ears have small gauges and it really tugged on them. I had to return them. Very beautiful though!"
4.0,"I waited about 10 days to write a review as I wanted to have some time with the watch. Here are my impressions:<br /><br />1) It looks serious and it feels solid. In 10 days it has been accurate. The case does not feel cheap, the leather band looks and feels similar to that of other similar watches I have owned. So in this sense it is all good. And the overall look is a nice one which is a good thing as well.<br /><br />But, that is not the end of the story:<br /><br />2) This morning (i.e., 10 days after getting it) the power hand is no longer working. The watch is still working thankfully, but the power indicator is stuck on basically zero and does not move any more.  It is the least important part of the watch, but now one has no idea how much power is left.<br /><br />3) The Moon Phase complication looks nice, but it is very hard to set up properly. I had to wait for the new Moon on April 1st to have a feeling for where I should put the Moon as far as its positions goes. Does it work? In ten days it has moved, let's see if it keeps up the right pace.<br /><br />4) The numbers on the dial and all the labels look very elegant, but they are so small that they are really hard to see. And I am not even wearing glasses! To see the days for the Moon phase I had to basically were my special glasses that I use for painting miniatures (magnification up to 6x).<br /><br />Conclusion.  I am very disappointed that one complication seems to be already broken after barely 10 days.  And I have even some concerns about the moon phase complication. Hopefully it will work.  It seems to work well in terms of accuracy and it does not look and does not feel cheap. Still it feels like I am wearing a defective watch now. And that after only 10 days.  A bit disappointing, frankly. I get that for $250ish one cannot expect a Swiss quality watch, but still, 10 days is way too early to have issues.<br /><br />It goes to show that there is some merit behind the old saying ""He who spends more, spends less"".  Now what do I do? Wear a watch with issues? Send it back and wait months ?  Probably I write it down as a loss and next time will buy a more expensive but more durable watch."
4.0,Fine product for the price
4.0,"I really liked the design of the necklace when I saw it, but was unsure how it would look in person. I was honestly worrying that it would look cheap and be ungiftable. However, I was very surprised by the quality. It looks great and there aren't any imperfections that would belie what you see in the description images.<br /><br />I will however say that I was surprised by how big the middle stone was, despite having seen all of the images presented in the description. It's not a bad thing though, it still looks good. It's a bit too big for my style, but I'm sure other people would be fine with it.<br /><br />The only thing I was not happy with was the box for the necklace. It's cardboard/paper, which was fine. However, a sticker was stuck to it and it was impossible to take off without ruining it. So, if you wanted to give this as a gift, you'd have to be okay with the ugly sticker or you'd have to have a back up box or bag for it."
4.0,Fabric a little thin
4.0,"For the price, the quality and everything else was not lacking. I was told it felt a little snug, but all in all no major complaints."
4.0,"Exactly what I expected. Good price, ok quality. I'll take them to the optometrist and change the lenses with my prescription, then I'll flip and have my own personalized shades."
4.0,These are beautiful. The only thing I don't like is that the hook feels cheap and I'm afraid if I wear them too much they'll break. But I'm a book nerd and love to have items that are mentioned in the books I read and these earrings remind me of one of my favorite suspense novels.
4.0,"There are several vendors that are selling 'outdoor life' pants. Magcomsen and Naokenu are two. I ordered the fleeced lined from one and this is the lightweight form Naokenu.  The fit is exactly what others mentioned and worked well for 5'11"" 290lbs guy like me. Everything stretches, so that is helpful as well."
4.0,"There is way too much fabric in the front as some reviewers indicated. You can adjust the folds and tuck in  the excess but it looks weird. I am keeping it and using a shawl pin to pin the excess folds into place. It's a pretty shirt but unless you are a DDD, there will be way too much fabric bunching up in the front. I am 34B and the front gaps open with all these excess droops. Also, it is long. I am long waisted and it was too long for me. But again, you can adjust the folds so it's shorter but I don't have hips so I can do that. If you are hippy, it will make you look like you have rolls on your hips. Fabric is nice and the shirt was really wrinkled when it arrived but I used a steamer on it and the wrinkles all steamed out very nicely.  Due to all the folds of the fabric, this is actually not something you would wear on hot days or if you are hot flashing."
4.0,"Very comfortable and good quality. The only thing that bothers me is that the top of the boot where your ankle is. The opening is very large which means that my jeans don't go over the top of my boots and makes them a bit awkward. Still, they are incredibly comfortable and the fit is perfect."
4.0,The material was really good quality it was very comfortable i order a large and it was a little wider and not as long as i expected it to be for that reason i had to give it 4 stars otherwise i would have given it a 5
4.0,These are plastic but worked for what I needed. I used them to ship suitcases across country. They all survived. Would use again.
4.0,"I have a size 8.5 feet and these work fine for me, however i have to make sure they are on just so or my little toe might pop out."
4.0,Mask looks very nice but is not made for an adult unless your face is the size of a child's face! It's still wearable but does not fit properly around your face.
4.0,Beautiful shirt. I really like it except the upper arm part is a by small. I will have to be careful not to rip it. Silky-ish material.
4.0,"Liked the ring. Its very unique and odd. The size of the snake is perfect for my small slim hands. The only thing i have a prob with is the chain that is wrapped around the finger, is a bit big. but overall its worth the price.."
4.0,"For the most part the shoes were what I expected. They ride a little high up on my ankles, but as I wear them, they are getting more comfortable."
4.0,"I really love these.  They are perfect for many types of shoes.  I wish they had then in knee highs!<br /><br />After a few months of wear, I noticed that the big toe got little tiny holes in them.  Now, just about every sock has worn through.  They are great socks when you first buy them,  but they do not last.  I wear them everyday to work during the school year, so I didn't even wear them during the summer months.  I am disappointed and will try to find another comfortable brand that will hold up."
4.0,"Love these sunglasses and always get compliments while wearing them. However, they are hard to keep clean and pinch my nose while wearing."
4.0,I was very skeptical about this at first but am very glad I bought it. It is now one of my favorite dresses. It is a little low cut in the front but I just put a few stitches in it and now it is perfect. The material is a little see through if you wear something dark under it but I wore white and it was fine then.
4.0,Super soft and comfy!  Perfect for lounging.
4.0,"It's a very cute dress but the buttons are loose. I wore it once and a button came off, that was my only issue. I'm around 170 and 5'5 and got a Large and it fit right."
4.0,"This is a great practice jersey, fits perfect and comfortable quality material. Arrived on time. It's the simple things."
4.0,"The fit is a little off. They are very long and very wide in the leg, while kind of tight at the waist. I still think these are a good buy"
4.0,Run a little small and a little see through
4.0,"This is a good and durable mask. It is supposed to be the same filtration/protection as a N95. The advantage here is that this mask is neoprene (durable) and the filter pads are interchangeable. I've been using one for sometime now, but one of the exhalation valves fell off w/o my knowledge and I had a hole exposing me to the public/environment.<br />If you get one of these, you should also get carbon filter pads and exhalation valves as spares.  I gotta funny feeling we are gonna be wearing these things for quite awhile."
4.0,"I bought these to wear under a tutu for a couple of Christmas parties. They are super cute when worn that way, but I would caution someone on buying them to wear with just a shirt--they're awfully thin."
4.0,"A little heavier and bigger than expected, but it is a nice hair brochure"
4.0,"Love it! Thick material! Looks great with a pair of thigh highs! I also love that it can be knotted in the front or worn as a dress or long t-shirt. I m 5'4, 134 lbs, lots of booty. I ordered a Large because I wanted it more so for the long T shirt fit. It's doesn't feel cheesy at all. Came clean and in the the arrival date. Four stars because it has a really awkward neckline.<br /><br />Will post a pic once I wear it '"
4.0,This dress looks great!! It was a great fit and flattering! The color is rich and beautiful! But I had to remove a star because it shrunk in the wash. So it might be good to order a size up.
4.0,Love this! It’s so cute!
4.0,"These earrings are all so cute and I wear them every day! The backs sometimes have trouble staying on, and I have definitely lost a few without noticing since they tend to fall out if I wear them for too long. Definitely great value for the price though"
4.0,"This review is for the dark gray hedgehog mittens. They are not fingerless gloves. These are absolutely adorable, but there were a few quality control issues. I recommend that you check them over before you give them as a gift. The sizing may vary. I have two pairs and one pair is about one half inch shorter than the other - 9 inches vs. 9.5 inches. Both pairs still fit, but longer pair is a bit more comfortable. Both have a 2 inch knitted cuff.  I had to use a needle and thread to sew the warm white knit lining and fix where one part of the knitted mitten had a gap which made the lining visible. I sewed on one eye a bit better and also sewed where the end of the yarn was visible on the ears. In addition, I stitched a bit at the top where the hedgehog material is sewn onto the mitten.  Please note that you should air them out a bit because they have some chemical odor. They are 80% acrylic and 20% polyester and look like they are hand knitted. Even with all these little “improvements”, I still love these mittens! The dark gray is a lovely color!"
4.0,"Very well made, thicker material has held up well to several washing. However they do run large, normally a size medium a small fit perfectly and little to no shrinking."
4.0,"I got these in a Medium size.  My pants are generally 30/32 or 32/32, and my boxers and briefs usually a medium.  For these, I'm not sure.  They are a bit too loose, but not so much Id say they dont fit, they just..dont fit quite right.  Sadly, i think the offset is so small that if I got a small to replace them, that would be TOO small.<br /><br />These are soft and comfortable though, and I like the little breathability holes.  Do keep in mind that they are LITERALLY HOLES, so, wearing these at the gym or something where you don't want bare skin visible is not a good idea."
4.0,"This shirt is thin and clingy, showing all the imperfections (i.e  rolls) on the body. It stretches nicely. This works better on a body with no rolls, or someone who doesn't care to hide their rolls. I ended up donating it."
4.0,Not true to size but managable after a few wears.
4.0,"I like the colors and fit, I feel better that I have something to let medical responders know  about my condition."
4.0,It was of good gaulity
4.0,This looks so great! I mean it literally looks like a uniform from the movie. The dress will obviously require some ironing to get the wrinkles out but the hat is actually quality in the belt is great too. The only thing that I was slightly bummed out by was the red so-called socks. The description says their socks but they're not they are tights and they're very prone to rolling down. I'll probably end up picking up my own red socks to go with this for Halloween but other than that small detail I love this. definitely a paid attention to the size chart. I ordered a size large and I usually wear a small or even a medium at the most. So I would recommend sizing up to full sizes in this.
4.0,Would give it 5 stars except it is a little stinky.
4.0,"Soft,thick,warm and lovely socks! Definitely would purchase again."
4.0,"I wanted something very different than the million other ""boring"" watch bands out there and after spending a few hours on amazon I found this beauty. I've got to warn you though you will get very frustrated with taking out the links but I've got to tell you this link removal kit is much better than the other seller who offers the same band (his is also more money).<br />I ordered the first band and I got something to take the links out which frustrated me so much after 5 or 6 of the tips broke when I tried to make the band smaller.  If you follow the EXACT instructions you will find it goes very smoothly.... Note: If you push the pin out from the wrong side the pin will never come out..<br /><br />After I made the band smaller it was just right and it looks pretty great...Lots of compliments..."
4.0,"I'm 5'10&quot; and about 165lbs, with broad shoulders. The only thing that doesn't seem right, is that the scalloped neckline (when it stretches as I'm wearing it) rolls forward and sticks out from my chest. Other than that... the fabric feels nice, it looks put together well, it's plenty long on me, the sleeves feel nice, and it looks amazing. :) I wore it with a little petticoat to fluff it.<br />I can't wait to wear it out!"
4.0,The dress it self is nice other than the loosestrings
4.0,Fast delivery and item is just like picture
4.0,They work for what I need them for. I am allergic to disposable mask so I needed something as a barrier between my face and the disposable mask. Works pretty well except the ear loop don't stay on that part is too big so I have to keep adjusting. Other than that they are OK.
4.0,"I am 5'7'', 125 and bought a small in this dress. The slit comes up mid-thigh on me (sexy! lol), the length almost hits the floor with flat sandals on. The arm hole area was large, showed my bra easily on the sides. So I ended up wearing a fitted white t-shirt for a layering look underneath and then later a peach colored oversize sweater. Overall happy with this dress, the pattern and colors are spot on with the photo and so cute! Definitely can be used as a swim suit coverup but also looks cute with wedges/flats and for me, something under it or over it. :D"
4.0,It feels great. better check the size when you wanna buy it.
4.0,Love them very much! Should've ordered a size up but I still love them!
4.0,NICE WATCH  FOR PRICE  JERRY
4.0,love these boots. They are comfortable and wear them daily.
4.0,Can’ Beat the price for these recreational and effective sunglasses.
4.0,Fit is fine.  The screen finger pads work well even the dark black of the pads is a bit jarring against the brown glove.
4.0,Was for a 10 year old's birthday gift and she LOVED them.  Great item.
4.0,I have this dress is several colors and wear them all the time.  Great for daily lounging around or dress up a little for a casual outing.  Great spring through fall - just through a jean jacket or sweater on for a new look.
4.0,"This is a very cute outfit, and the look and feel is quality. That is why I give it four stars. There are issues, though. The first is that I cannot find a zipper anywhere. The item goes on with reasonable ease standing, but it is extremely difficult to take off. There should definitely be a zipper! I am a teacher, and I will not be able to wear this to work or anywhere I might be rushed in the restroom. Secondly, make sure you round up your measurements instead of down to get the fabric design you want. Theoretically, a large should fit me, and it does when it’s on. But again, I found it very hard to take off due to their being no zipper and probably my large bust measurement. Also, I am a little round in the stomach, and this is not forgiving on that. I’ll still wear it, though. I just can’t wear it if I’ve had salty foods. Measurements: 40-34-40. Weight: 145. Height: 5’5”"
4.0,"I literally laughed when I saw these glasses, and I had to have it. Growing up I always wanted a pair of these, these were so in style back in the days. It's certainly on brand with what was advertised. I guess these would be perfect for a costume or if you wanted to dress like Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson Y2K era. It's pretty comfortable so far for the 20 mins that I was wearing them, and it doesn't look and feel like the cheap $4 glasses you would get at the gas station."
4.0,Served its purpose and is definitely something that is a multi-function use.
4.0,"Good beanies. Thin and slouchy. The only problem I have is that they are getting a little loose around the band. You get what you pay for though, these were a good deal."
4.0,Great material runs big
4.0,"Really gorgeous scarf, perfect size, great quality and made the best gift.  Shall probably order one for myself...<br />This brand has so many great looking products, excited to try more."
4.0,"The cap is off decent quality,  not great quality.  The description fails to state if the logo is stitched or applied (not sure what that type is called) but it is applied (like screen printing). The hat is overpriced -in my opinion- compared to similar quality hats.  I think the ad on Amazon is a bit deceiving because the 2nd photo (which shows a hat from the side) shows raised stitching... but it is NOT this hat. I wish companies on Amazon would strive to be more honest in their product ads (why show a hat...in this ad... that is not this hat). This is the only Husaberg cap I have found and I probably would have purchased it (and kept it) if the ad was more transparent but,  given the addition of misleading photos,  I plan to return it."
4.0,"Great product, just wish it was thinner material. This will be great on those crisp fall morning rides."
4.0,"Doesn't have the sizes marked on the various adjustment slots like some other ties have other.  Otherwise, it looks great!"
4.0,Very nice jewelry. Very good bargain for the money.
4.0,"The amount of compression is good, but the foot part of the sock is much too large for my size 10-11 foot."
4.0,My grandson loves these tshirts
4.0,"I like this tank for the most part.  The material is nice, the graphic is great.  The fit is a bit off for me so I won't be wearing it on it's own.  The sleeve holes hang too low and show the bra on the sides, unfortunately.  However, I like the length."
4.0,"This jumpsuit is SUPER cute and such a good deal for the price. I was unsure whether I should order the 4/6 or the 8/10 as I'm usually around a size 6 but other reviews said that is ran small. I didn't think so at all. The 8/10 was a bit big, especially in the chest area but the little tie around the waist helped out a lot so that I could tighten to fit well. I really, really like this! I received many compliments and it's just such a unique looking jumpsuit. I will say, the quality isn't perfect, so I took a star away...the lining at the top of the jumpsuit is a bit flimsy. But, overall, for the price, this was an EXTREMELY good buy!"
4.0,"The grey hamster came and the strings holding his hands together are coming apart, and his foot which is apparently just glued on is coming off. I'm not returning bc I can fix both of these things myself, but of course it'd be nice to not have to. But overall they are both adorable and I'd still recommend."
4.0,Works fine to protect shirt from transfer of newspaper ink to shirt when reading the paper.
4.0,A little tight for me but it's pretty and I do like it. Purchased at discount for honest review.
4.0,"This shoe is so cute. I love the height and they look so cute with jean shorts and capris.  The only thing I didn't like was the underneath the strap across the foot scratches a little.  The fit to size.  I wear an 8 and they leave no room, getting an 8.5 would probably be too big."
4.0,Thick and a little stiff. I will keep wearing it to break it in. Very well made with good stitching.
4.0,"I love it, but they are broked after 3 months, the legs are very fragile."
4.0,"I ordered the white and blue flower suit for my 11 year old daughter, last year, June 2017. She wanted something long sleeve as she burns very easily.<br />For reference,  My daughter is 4’10” and weighs about 90 pounds. She’s in 6th grade.<br />After reading reviews and measurements,  I decided that she would likely be a size M(2-4) so that’s what I ordered.<br />The top fit/still fits her perfectly. There is padding in the bust which can be removed if needed or wanted. The colors are vibrant and it honestly is such a cute top! I will say that the suit top doesn’t go as far down as it does on the woman in the picture, it’s only just below the bust on my daughter. The sleeves were the perfect length.<br />The bottoms on the other hand didn’t fit my daughter.(( I believe that the bottoms would most likely work for an average girl her age though as her cousins that are her same size could fit the bottoms perfectly. )) They were a couple inches too short on her backside which showed off her crack! I will say that my daughter has a serious bubble butt so I wasn’t really surprised that they didn’t fit her backside. She just wore the top with a different pair of bottoms.<br />Overall we love this swim suit. It has held up awesomely for nearly a year, and it was used almost daily in the chlorinated swimming pool last summer.<br />She gets so many compliments on this swim suit!"
4.0,"Since the bloomers were from the range of 6 months to 3 years, I really didn't expect them to fit perfectly. My granddaughter is just fitting in a size 24 months. I was able to take them in on the sides. They will look beautiful under her dress at the wedding."
4.0,"Well made and pretty handbag, but a little heavy than I like. There are a advertisement and a advise for the smell in the package, it is very disgusting, I hope it dissapear with the use."
4.0,"Good material and very comfortable, warm and Stylish. Besides arrive on time"
4.0,The brim that blocks sun is flat instead of round like a baseball cap. Its also small fitting.
4.0,"Nice pretty glasses. Lenses aren't super durable, they scratch fairly easily."
4.0,"The lining inside the shoe has come off after a month wearing it, it still does wonders for my one year old who is not walking and doesn't keep her shoes on, somehow she keeps them all the time, she likes the shoes they are probably comfortable and she doesn't mind having them on. They are cute exactly what you see in the pics is what you get."
4.0,"Shipped and arrived with no trouble, very speedy. My only complaint is minor, that the jewelry is much smaller than I anticipated. Besides that, I received exactly what the picture shows, in very nice packaging. The studs are approximately the size of a pencil eraser."
4.0,Went bad in 2 months poor quality
4.0,I returned it because the color was not what I wanted.  It was overall some cute short. Very comfortable.
4.0,"I like the MAMA word, though I thought the letters and butterflies would be a little smaller and more delicate. They are not tiny letters- more medium sized, which is cute, just bigger than I was expecting. Very giftable! I really like the version with the heart in the middle of the word MAMA."
4.0,Durable didn't fade but did fade after constant exposure.
4.0,"These slippers are very attractive and warm.  I can’t beat the price.  I wear a 6.5 and ordered the 7/8.  Length is fine, but quite wide.  They have no arch, so I put one in.  Now they are more comfortable and fit better."
4.0,"The craftsmanship is good for the price I paid, however it does not have a adjustment section that you can remove to fit the watch better to your wrist. Also, the clasp is much flimsier material than the band, so if you're not careful it might break easily."
4.0,Love it can't wait to wear it!!
4.0,"Cute, lightweight, trendy, easy to insert and remove but hangs a bit loose in the septum making it feel like you have a runny nose."
4.0,"This watch band worked fine and permits me to wear my watch; BUT, it is not even close to the heavy-duty quality of the band that came with the watch."
4.0,"Pretty formal dress, but I returned it because it was too small for me. I ordered the navy color. It was tighter than expected."
4.0,I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly!! The material is a little thick and gets hot in the summer. But its good quality!!! I have a white and pink one!
4.0,"good length, a big big on the sides area. overall okay. fabric was comfy."
4.0,It’s beautiful and easy to use which is why I gave it 4 stars but did not have any kind of protective covers to prevent scratching of the tag.
4.0,"Could use a little more padding in the sole, there really is none, it feels like the ball of your foot is walking on concrete."
4.0,"Very cute, elegant dress. It flows nicely and is great for any occasion. Unfortunately, the size 4/6 is a bit too large for me. I'm 5'5'' and weigh 110 Ibs. The dress is too loose from the waist up, so I may need to have it fitted if possible. Otherwise, I really like it."
4.0,It was a bit small. I&#34;m usually a medium but I bought a large and it was still a bit small on me. Recommend going 2 sizes up if you can. The material is great and the shirt looks exactly like the picture
4.0,"Picked this up to add to a Wednesday Addams costume, and it was a great, subtle reference to the show.  Colors weren't as vibrant as I was hoping, but still captures the symbol well."
4.0,"Much more comfortable than a different brand I tried. They're more yellow than gold/amber like I was hoping, but they do the job. They came scratched, but it's on the corner of the lens out of view. Not worth the hassle to return and replace."
4.0,"Cute cat, kind of poorly painted. Little heavy for my ear, maybe my ears are too big. The post was bent when I got it but this company was great enough to ship me a new one!"
4.0,"Very nice selection of different colored soft crop tops for any occasion. Look great, wash well and are super soft cotton, so they don't ride up or wrinkle easily. For those of us lady with larger busts, it will look more like an oversized sports bra, but it doubles as extra support for any sort of jumping activity so I'm pretty happy about them. The racerback is very comfortable, the stitching is very tight, and the tops fit true to size, feel great to wear, and are super comfortable to boot. I have washed them multiple times, dried them, and worked out in them and they hold up to a lot of abuse as well. Great selection of shirts which fit and feel great for any occasion."
4.0,It's perfect for what I needed! I needed a phone case & a place for my credit cards & money. I don't carry a purse while I'm working (outdoors) so this pouch is perfect. It's well made and quite good looking.
4.0,Don't like the style
4.0,True to fit and well made!
4.0,Didn't fit but beautiful
4.0,"I haven’t had these for long and only washed them once (handwash cycle and line dry) but so far I love them!! Confortable and the pockets fit my iPhone Plus on one side, and big bunch of keys on the other side. Even on a trampoline, nothing fell out. Would but these again.<br />Not yet giving it 5 stars because I want to see how it holds up multiple washes and general durability."
4.0,They got here 10 days early. I'm 5'2 and they go most of the way up my thigh.  They're cheap so don't expect amazing things.  I got two weird cheap looking earring in my package as well??? I don't know what they are I did not order them. . . has this happened for anyone else?  Sorry if I got someones cheap earrings by mistake!
4.0,"Love the look and feel of the bag. It's just one receptacle so no extra pockets for smaller items, but it looks and feels great."
4.0,Mom really liked and anti slip a must
4.0,"i like it, its a little small but its ok. still possible to wear and it is really good for smiw"
4.0,They are a cheaper version of crocs but they do run small.
4.0,They fit as expected (I ordered an XXL and I wear an 18W) and the padding was perfect for my long training  rides (2 hours+).  My only complaint (and why I gave a 4 stars instead of 5 stars) is that there is no elastic around the legs so the shorts ride up during my ride.  Because of this - I would not wear these outside of indoor training rides.
4.0,The mask were perfect for my client’s event.
4.0,Soft and warm. 1 star less for shapelessness and drooping shoulders.
4.0,"Beautiful jacket, but had to return as it ran small."
4.0,Fabric is a light faux wool. It's nice if you come from a pet free home. If not this thing will be more work than its worth for everyday use. Pet hair clings viciously to it. I only wanted it for a witch costume/Renaissance costume so it won't be used everyday. Will try and add photos later.
4.0,descent quality for the price paid.
4.0,Nice style kids shoes and best customer service.
4.0,The sizes are off a bit and you may want to order two sizes up. I ordered it one size up and made it work but u fortunately we won’t be able to wear these again. It was adorable for a mommy and me photo session whilemin vacation.
4.0,"Loved these glasses for 6 weeks then the bow cracked and broke putting them on, I was sad"
4.0,"Nice faux jewelry;not very well suited for larger~width fingers,but was able to make some work as middies!"
4.0,I love everything about it EXCEPT it looks more like a very very dark purple to some ppl and brown to others
4.0,"Great boas! I got three of them to make a peacock skirt for Halloween and they barely shed, despite being sit on and played with all night. And they're so pretty! I gave it four stars instead of five because when I initially pulled them out of the package a decent amount of feathers came off, but those seemed to be all that really shed during the use of these."
4.0,Size 12 order a Large.
4.0,Love the design and it fits well on my putter. I wished it was a magnetic closure instead of velcro otherwise I would have rated it a 5 stars
4.0,A bit tight. Very cute and stylish.
4.0,"I really like this hat in terms of look and warmth. My only caution is the fit .... it's a bit snug and I have a small head. So just be aware if you normally get a larger size hat, this probably won't fit you."
4.0,"Be sure to buy way large. This is much smaller than expected. I'm sorry for that because the style truly is beautiful and the quality, great."
4.0,Lights up the whole room
4.0,"I am so glad I bought more than one pair. These are my favorite sweatpants because of the longer length, side pockets, lightness of material, and softness."
4.0,Good product for the money. Don't get the black one!
4.0,Beautiful case. A bit thicker than I expected but still streamlined enough to work for me
4.0,"These Retro Aviator Sunglasses for Men by DTIUGUTAE have polarized plastic lenses. It comes in a pouch. I suggest that they be kept in the pouch or some kind of glass case because the plastic lenses can scratch and get frosty. Otherwise, they are rather nice light-weight sun glasses. I like them especially when I am driving."
4.0,"Got this for my 18 month old granddaughter, got the smallest size, and my daughter said it is huge!  they will save it for next year.  She did say it was well made, sort of sweatshirt material, and nice."
4.0,Material is extremely thin and have to wear a tank under.
4.0,"Decent quality, good screen print. Cut is more on athletic side."
4.0,"Buy 2 sizes more than you use. Is so beautiful, have nice detail at the upper area.  I think the material was stretch like a t-shirt but not, but the fabric have nice and cute details."
4.0,"I really like this dress but the reason I give it 4 stars is because the length didn't work for me. In the photo that shows the woman wearing a dress and having it come above her knees. But since I'm short, for me the dress Lynx went under my knees and looks kind of dumpy. So I'm going to have to get it altered so it looks better. I did like the style of it though where it gathered at the waist and the color is perfect for wearing it to the office. This dress could be very professional-looking once the length is right."
4.0,Was as expected. Great for Halloween indoor event.
4.0,"The glasses are made well and provide good protection for my eyes. I found the bifocal reading area of the lens was too low. It worked well when I was looking downward, but looking straight forward at a computer screen or looking upward, it was of no help. I found myself frequently raising my glasses up to use the reading glass part."
4.0,Heavy. Nice.
4.0,"I really like the color and fit of this jacket, and the fabric is very soft and it moves well with you. The only downfall to it is that it wrinkles. Whether you are packing it to take on travel or simply just wearing it, the wrinkles appear very quickly and stay fairly set in. It’s nothing a steam iron over it quickly can’t take care of, but can get a little bit annoying. Overall it’s worth it though for the fit and comfort of the jacket."
4.0,"Ordered two sizes larger, XL, since I wear a medium and like things a bit loose.  It fits like it's a small in my opinion.  I can't wear it so I'll find someone to give it to as it's too much trouble to return it.  I received it in an unmarked fully visible piece of plastic that could not be reused.  Most of my prime comes in boxes, manila or prime white envelopes.  This was laying on my porch and I honestly thought someone must have dropped it.  I think the material would hold up but since the sizing is so off I won't be reordering."
4.0,Its great but very stiff. Love the pockets and zippers. They are strong.
4.0,"Comfortable,however the color is different than picture"
4.0,"Overall, these shoes were good water shoes. Worth the buy!"
4.0,"It works well, but go a size up as the tank top runs small."
4.0,Wow theeee softest pants ever !! So smooth. Very comfy. 4 starts because when moving alot like exercising they don't stay on. Look great and slimming. Not see through whatsoever. Get the size you would normally wear .
4.0,They did shrink a little in the dryer but they've stayed black and are just too fun. Comfy too!
4.0,I made a gift for my husband.  He was very happy
4.0,"It got here really Fast, But it definitely wasn't the color it has pictured. I mean this shemagh was  stark white! I was expecting more of a tanish color. But the person we got it for liked it so kudos there!"
4.0,A little on the small size. Color is nice. Would recommend. Will wear it again
4.0,"This is a nice costume but you should size up from your normal top size. I'm usually a m/l and got a XL that fit perfectly. If you're 5'10"" or over the torso part will be too short and give you extreme 🐪 toe lol. The bottom part of it is kinda see through and will hug all those curves. No hiding the belly here."
4.0,Fits well it’s a little tight in the waist
4.0,"I really wanted to like this shift, but the cut was not flattering. Maybe if my chest was smaller... considered getting a larger size but then the body would be too big."
4.0,"I have had it now for three hours, and cannot figure out how to get it open so I can wear it on my wrist! I’m hoping the seller will give some kind of instructions so that these bracelets can actually be worn."
4.0,"I'm 5'10 and dresses tend to be short on me, this one was actually a little bit too long for a summer dress, but not bad.  I already ordered another one."
4.0,"I love this shirt, it's soft, light weight, and super comfy. Based on other reviews of it running small I ordered a size bigger and glad I did. Normally I wear a medium but a large fits great. Honestly I could have even gone xl to get the more draped look like you see on the model. It could make an ok maternity shirt as long as you order a couple sizes up."
4.0,Straps don't fan out as much as the picture. But it's solid and made of stretchy material similar to a swimsuit. I wear it under low cut tops and dresses.
4.0,Pants are wider than expected in the hips and shorter than expected in length. Good quality material
4.0,I am 5'1&#34; and 150 pounds. I would say that the outfit does run small as its asian size. Be sure to oder a size up. Other than that the outfit is just like the picture and is beautiful.
4.0,It never made it to me. I am going to order it again.  I ordered two other styles like this one and the bottoms fit but the top was a little big. Over all I really liked the style.
4.0,"The fabric has a great stretch to it, but not for women with bumps and buldges.  The large looks like a junior size. I plan to give it to my daughter-in-law who usually wears a small."
4.0,"Very nice watch, unfortunately for me it was too big so... I returned it."
4.0,"Love the style,material and price"
4.0,Job related use
4.0,Color is closer to an aqua.
4.0,"First we have to remember these are a Novelty. Fish socks, no show. very soft. I washed these socks on delicate cold water and air dry. measured before and after. They did shrink a good deal. You can stretch them out a lot. They are still very soft. These are made of very thin material, but after a while they loosen out. They are just for fun. Not a heavy made sock, more novelty than everyday kind of wear. I hope this has helped. Thank You"
4.0,The blouse is really nice but does fit on the smaller side. I'm in between L and XL. I bought and L and it for closer to a Medium. I had to return it and really considering buying the XL!
4.0,"Great pants, very comfortable. They shrunk in length after the first wash but still cute."
4.0,This dress has a very comfortable feel. It’s nice for a very simple dress. Fit is as I expected it to be. My only complaint was that some of the seams were done messy and frayed quickly.
4.0,Teenage grandkids love it
4.0,really nice quality. fabric better than expected. would buy again
4.0,"This shirt is really pretty, fits perfect and I ordered it in my size and was delivered on time.<br /><br />I would recommend"
4.0,"I bought these for my boyfriend and he really likes them. They fit a little snug, overall we’re satisfied with the product."
4.0,Product is good and comfortable
4.0,"the stones both had a different cut but you could only see it if you looked really close, one was cut square with a square rise on top the other was square with an octagonal shape on top, girlfriend likes then so thats all that really matters. thanks"
4.0,seems to be made well
4.0,"Great fit, but the color was different from picture"
4.0,"Love the look however, these DEFINITELY will not fit your usual size. Why with a 33"" waist I need a 2XL is whole other review. At issue is the quality/material you get seems to depend on the color you order. I have purchased 3 pair with another on the way and they all contain different percentages of cotton and polyester. With these my experience is the higher the cotton content the likelier they are to fall apart in a year or so (as one pair have already). The velcro pocket snaps are firm in the beginning but do not last long. These are not a forever purchase.<br /><br />With that said, provided you purchase the correct size, they look incredibly nice in the gym or for a less than casual event."
4.0,"Love the hat, maybe just a bit too distressed to look natural"
4.0,Great leggings but they were a bit tight making the cinched effect not work. I got the same exact leggings in another color and they fit as they are supposed to. So I am thinking I just got a defective pair in the black.
4.0,"The bikini is cute and the quality is decent. Now, the bottom part is very small."
4.0,Bought for my husband:  he likes it!
4.0,"It’s a cute mask/hat thing. It has two light settings, one that flashes and one that’s solid. According to the three of my children it’s hard to see while wearing. I believe them, it didn’t fit my head with my glasses on and since I can’t see with them off anyway I cannot confirm. The annoying part is that it doesn’t roll to a circle. It’s definitely a triangle but honestly it still did the job and didn’t look bad at all."
4.0,So comfy and I was quite surprised. It's the first clothing purchase I've made off of Amazon and I think I shall make some more!
4.0,"Material: Polyester and cotton. Machine wash cold like colors, tumble dry low or hang dry. Bow belt short romper jumpsuit. Round neckline, Short sleeve. Key hole with button closure on the back. High waist, dark blue. Isn't overly soft.  high quality, nice stitching. Casual and basic garment, not professional jumpsuit. Could be club outfit, or casual outing.<br />Female Bell Sleeve Drawstring Waist Beach Overall with Bow Belt that comes unattached to jumpsuit.<br />I'm quite tall over 6ft, so this was short on me if it were a skirt id never wear it, but I can get away with these being shorts. self-tie belt forming cute bow knot. The loose fit gives you relaxed fit look. This is unique, but would never be a staple outfit in my wardrobe. The size chart of Women Short Jumpsuit is as follows:<br />Small(US2-4): Bust----39.0''; length----32.7''; waist---25.2''; Hip----36.6''<br />Medium(US6-8): Bust----40.9''; length----33.5''; waist----26.8''; Hip----38.6''<br />Large: Bust(US10-12)----42.9''; length----34.3''; waist----28.7''; Hip----40.6''<br />X-Large(US14): Bust----44.9''; length----35.0''; waist----30.7''; Hip----42.5''"
4.0,Great product very soft and comfortable love the pockets
4.0,"Other than the fact that it wrinkles when packed, I love it......."
4.0,"I got this gift for my friend and she loved it, got lots of compliments at church . Good quality, it didn't feel light, brilliant color."
4.0,"Very pretty and was as pictured. They were slightly larger than I would have liked, but still a nice earring."
4.0,Nice pencil skirt.  Fits well with lots of stretch
4.0,Really soft. Comfortable. Cute.<br />4 stars because the sole is really thin and will likely wear out quickly.
4.0,Like these a lot and so does my wife. Look good. They do make my wrist itch just a bit
4.0,Use the qr capability cause the jumping Jack's don't always count.
4.0,"Loved the colors, fit well, and not bulky. Not as warm as needed in cold weather and touch screen works only fairly."
4.0,"This looks so pretty, shiny, I say better than costume jewelry, food prive."
4.0,"Came as described. Looks great and stylish, the only complaint I have is that the rubber bands fall off sometimes."
4.0,"2XL Jacket is exactly what I expected.  The pink jacket color is is a 2XL fits true to size and looks great!  The draw string at the waist is a nice feature to adjust the fit as necessary for the look you're going for.  The jacket lining feels silky smooth and soft and is not padded making the jacket fit smoothly.  That's great!  It's light weight and will be perfect for the 40-60 degree temps.<br />Quality Control Dept.:  The pocket lining was not completely sewn together leaving a 1-1/2"" hole in the pocket lining.  I will hand sew this.<br />I had ordered a 2xl and 3xl unsure of the fit since this was my 1st order to this company.  I gave the 3XL to a friend."
4.0,"Dainty necklace for Summer, better suited for petite persons, well made and I really like the large pearl.  Overall I am pleased and would recommend this necklace."
4.0,Perfect for different styles
4.0,"These earrings are absolutely gorgeous!!! The price is great!! They actually look and feel way more expensive than they are, however I did give them 4 stars ONLY because the Rose Quartz color is actually &#34;half blush half clear&#34;...not very much pink in them... Not a huge deal breaker for me, but it would have been nice if they were solid blush pink like the picture."
4.0,"Great quality to price ratio. I did have to file a tiny amount from the end links to get them to fit into a watch that had previously been fitted with an 18mm band. No comment on resizing, since it happened to be already set to my wrist size."
4.0,"Used at work for books, pens, snacks. Lots of pockets, great for uses, the slide on the belt moves though so I have to tighten it throughout the day so it doesn’t fall off."
4.0,The socks are very fun colors and comforyable to wear
4.0,Love the color and style as I'm heavy in the waist.  This dress fits great on me.
4.0,Really cute but extremely see through! I really wanted to be able to wear these in the summer just running out town but looks like I'll have to keep them for Beach/pool use only. Way to see through even for white underwear. Definitely going to be a swimsuit cover. Still super cute
4.0,Light with just a bit of shine. But just a bit narrow. Length was fine but I would have liked to see another set of chiffon and shiny material.
4.0,"These are really nice socks, especially for the price. The S/M is still a bit too big - I wish there was an actual size Small. But the quality is good and they hold up well in the wash."
4.0,Cute boot!  The only thing I would mention is it is a little tight/stiff on the top of my foot.
4.0,"Nice shirt though but I ordered the largest size they had and I wear a large, the damn thing was still to tight!....Oh well,gave it to my son, at least he is happy!"
4.0,These linen shorts look and feel amazing. I recommend them. I ordered the wrong size so I'm returning them and buying right size.
4.0,I really like this swimsuit but you must remember always get 1 size larger than you wear
4.0,"I love this jacket ! Was just what I have been looking for. Perfect length, covers just enough bottom ! However, I did order 1-2 sizes larger than I normally would ... due to reviews ... and this large fits snug but just right. Not like a large should fit on me. Normally I wear s/m. This is why I give it 4 stars. Sizing needs recharted."
4.0,Very Comfortable. Purchased for a trip to NYC in October.  Kept me warm when the winds blew.
4.0,"This dress runs a little small.  I was hoping for a more lose fitting dress and ordered my size accordingly.  With that said...it isn't TOO small, I can still wear this.  The fabric is a good thick fabric looks well made... doesn't smell of chemicals like a lot of things I buy off Amazon.  This dress is definitely worth the $8.00 I paid for it."
4.0,"Love how this fits from the top. The bottom crotch area is a little snug. I was comfortable all day in it though. My daughter complimented that it makes me look slimmer, which mad my day. It does hold everything in very well. I would buy more of them!"
4.0,"The keychain was almost everything I wanted: attaching/detaching rings is easy, the chain makes it easy to pull they keys from my pocket; you have the option to connect the keyrings directly to the clasp for easy access; you may use keys without removing them from the keyring.  I rated this 4/5 stars because the chain was a little too short and the links kept getting tangled, and were difficult to untangle.  I replaced the chain with a longer, heavier one, which made it just about perfect for my needs.  I just wish there as a way to detach keys with one hand, without having to drop them to the floor."
4.0,VERY DAINTY AND STURDY!~
4.0,Great bag!!!Wish it were bigger...
4.0,"Fits my curves great but... the cowl neck is slightly off, its thin and it has this weird smell that I thought would go away when I washed it but it didnt"
4.0,"My calves measure 14.5 inches, yet these are very tight, like tight knee socks. Yes, they are very warm, however, I can't wear them over jeans as they are just that tight. They stretch enough to get them on but are tight at the top and bottom. Nicely boxed, generally well made and a pretty color. I wish they had more stretch so I could wear them with jeans, though."
4.0,"I haven't worn the tie tack and cuff links yet, but they're to go with my bright red sports jacket I bought from the Marine Corps Association. The colors look great, and the mechanisms attached all seem to work fine."
4.0,My only complaint is the shelfbra isn't quite big enough for me...making it very low cut.
4.0,Watch looked nice and functioned perfectly though the face is kind of on the delicate side. I'm a cocktail waitress and needed it to keep track of happy hour. I loved this watch but it was short lived because the face hit the corner of a table (not with much force) causing it to break.
4.0,Looks Comfortable!  It is a gift.
4.0,"This is a good dress. It's sort of a light sweater knit on top and a sort of stiff cotton bottom. It's pretty. Definitely read the other reviews about size and verify your measurements. I ordered a 3X and I'm a busty size 20 (40DD, 5'8&#34; normally size 20) and it fits perfectly. The side zipper is a little hard to get up and down, but no biggie really."
4.0,I bought to replace the ring on my key fob. The first one did not return to its original shape upon getting it on the fob. The second one worked.
4.0,I love this ring! But... it is a little smaller than most. The ring its self is just a little bit smaller but other than that I love it. It's super cute. It's not quite as shiny as the picture.
4.0,Somewhat big but i like...
4.0,"i didn't realize that the sleeves were sewn differently. I'm not sure how to explain how the sleeves are sewn. I also bought a large on accident when I meant to buy a medium. It just a bit big, but these are supposed to be flowy so i guess it's good. :)"
4.0,"I’m 5’2 and roughly 140 lbs and the suit fits very well and isn’t too small. The material feels a little cheap, but that’s to be expected because of the price and it doesn’t feel uncomfortable on the skin. A good buy all in all."
4.0,used it for a costume
4.0,This would be five stars if the wristlet strap would attach. The wallet fist a decent amount of cards and change. It wont fit into smaller purses but overall would buy again.
4.0,"For the price of the dress it was worth it.  I'm almost 5'9 144lbs, ordered a small fit very well minus it was pretty tight going over my chest. So if you have a larger chest I'd order up a size. The dress does have some stretch to it but not super super stretchy.  The only complaint I have is there was a few different strings hanging off of the edges of the dress but was easy to just cut off.  I was happy with the length of the dress I was nervous it was going to be to short on me. Pretty decent dress for the price!"
4.0,Nice Halloween mask but I was expecting a bit more of a thicker material but it's a good looking mask
4.0,much darker than shown but i still like it
4.0,It was better than expected the top were too big but the bottom fit just perfect and they were easy to put in Easy instructions easy molding.. I love mine I only use the bottom..
4.0,"A little itchy at first, but a proper wash took care of that. Perfect for working at my computer."
4.0,"This set is nice for the price, but I suggest you going down a size if you want a tight fit."
4.0,"I'm 120lbs, 27.5 inch waist. The bust was a little big (see photo from other reviewer). Aside from that, I was pleasantly surprised. It's pretty cute, and the waist fit me. The dress is cheap feelin material but the wings are so cute."
4.0,"Every girl needs a cute basic dress, and this is it. Comfy, stretchy, and not extremely short. True to size, and color. EXTREMELY nice material, and stitching! Great for winter, with boots; it's like a very well fitted sweater."
4.0,Thinner than I expected.  Really nice style. Will look really nice with skinny jeans and a nice boot.
4.0,Three pairs for price of one!  Don't let the vacuum pack scare you.  The gloves look great after a few hours.  Nice fit.  Colors true to pictures!
4.0,Cute visor a lot of stretch
4.0,"Fit me well, it does hide my mid-section very well. The only problem is the cap sleeves stick out. Navy blue is bit too dark for me. I would re-order the purple color if the sleeves doesn't  stick out that much."
4.0,"Very cute but I totally could have just Cricut’d this myself for less, haha!"
4.0,This is the second pair of Draftsmen I've owned and they work well for me. I like the leather tops because many of the synthetic ones give my feet a rash. These also last a longer than most other brands I've owned.
4.0,The boots are beautiful and appear to be well built.  The size was a little larger than I find in the store.
4.0,I ordered these as a birthday gift. I thought that they were very pretty. I waited to see what they looked like before I would order the matching necklace. I will most likely order the necklace. The price was very reasonable.
4.0,Great strap. Easy to put on
4.0,The colour is perfect. The numerals are very visible and I can see them without my glasses. Longevity and accuracy will be the key factor whether I would completely endorse this unit. time will tell. The price was very acceptable. Delivery was spot on well packaged.
4.0,"great, comfortable"
4.0,Fits great and very stylish:)
4.0,"fits, look and works as expected. nice boot for the kids to play in the mud with."
4.0,Very comfortable...not so much of a heat resistance glove but gets the job done.
4.0,Nice key blank
4.0,My son decided he wanted a pinky ring. This pinky ring. Not sure why.<br />The ring is good quality. The impression is solid and legible. Not a cheap made ring. It has some heft to it and my son loves it.
4.0,Really love this sweater. I think designed to be a tight fit. Just a little too tight for my liking but I still wear it
4.0,Great buy but I have noticed that these irritate my nose ring hole. Other than that they're good.
4.0,"Absolutely loooove this wristlet!! Good quality & very spacious. The ONLY reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 & the one negative comment I’d make is, the inside of the bag has a weird smell. You can definitely tell they’ve been packaged & sitting in boxes in some warehouse for quite some time."
4.0,Good band but the pin broke used old and its fits good
4.0,For guys with big heads who use the last strap on caps it's a perfect fit. The shoestring it came with looked used and was torn.
4.0,This is a great lightweight multipurpose face mask. I was offered this mask for free to use and review. I have to say that this mask does everything it says it does. I used it while gardening and have to say that it reduced the wind chill without making my face and neck feel too hot. This is a very functional product that can be worn by either male or female. The only reason didn't give it a 5 star review is because I don't know if it is machine washable or not. I washed it by hand & it maintained well. I can't wait to use it when traveling up North this Christmas!
4.0,My daughter loved it ... she can’t take it off .
4.0,"You can't beat the China prices, but mine came with a blue stone, not green."
4.0,I was hoping for a better form fit.
4.0,Slips off the shoulder cute style but a bit annoying
4.0,"Used this band to replace a band I wasn’t fond of on a Citizen watch I had recently purchased. Installing the band was ten times easier than getting the original band off of the watch. The tools included with the band worked really well. Doubt I would have been able to swap them out without them. The band is comfortable right out of the package and should only get better with age. Can’t say anything about durability yet, but I wore the watch all day and hardly knew it was there. If I knew it would hold up over the long term, this would easily be a 5 star product."
4.0,Worked just fine It was shipped on time .
4.0,"Just a friendly FYI WARNING: The color of the world as seen through the ""Revo Orange"" tinted glasses is actually BLUE, and NOT ORANGE. Nowhere in the product description is this mentioned, as it was assumed to be orange (like other glasses are). This little gotcha actually bummed my son out, because we bought these to replace more expensive red-tinted wayfarer Ray Bans whose as-seen color tint met expectations."
4.0,"This fit as expected, but it is so short. If you have a big butt, it makes this dress even shorter"
4.0,Excellent product. Just as I expected they would be. The box was a very damaged when it arrived because of the packaging used but the product itself arrived in great shape. No complaints. 4 stars for packaging issue.
4.0,Cute but so tin
4.0,Pretty and nice quality. Too big for petite 11 year old.
4.0,Loved the style and size of this purse but the straps are kind of flimsy. Great for the price.
4.0,"Loved fabric and design, the shirt runs bug and really long."
4.0,Fits well but kind of odd feeling. I've only had it a few days so maybe I just need to get used to it.
4.0,Ordered this for my 84 yr old dad because he gets cold easily and it is still good quality.<br />Definitely thicker and warmer than other brands. And soft on the inside.<br /><br />Ordered the medium and it fit him perfectly (still allowing him to layer 1-2 underneath)
4.0,These socks have helped keep my feet from swelling while on the job. I am on my feet all day as a waitress and these have been wonderful.  My feet don't swell and aren't as tired at the end of the day.
4.0,Looks pretty but the beads are small for my liking. Color was pretty. I did return it.
4.0,"Fast shipping but did not get the item pictured. Our strap was a thin strap with a loop. but because I needed the shoes right away, we kept them.  Size 12 seemed to run a little larger. We had a size 10 that was great."
4.0,"Good quality, beautiful colors."
4.0,"This shirt is so cute! It really shows more up top than I expected, the chest area feels like it may fall but I've warn it twice now and haven't had any mishaps. Its very cute for a hot summer day."
4.0,"Just what I was looking for:  retro style, dark lenses, weight is just right, great price.  I'll buy again."
4.0,Very pretty bag :  )
4.0,"It isn't red, its a bright fuchsia which is really pretty. My only complaint is that the top slides down on the cord, so you have to keep it tied or it will basically fall off your body."
4.0,I have been buying for sometime however this time they seem larger and a little thicker. I wish the Velcro would hold up better. After a while it doesn't stay close.  All in all it's still worth the money.
4.0,"It was a good price, it looks fine, but it has a hole, I bought it as a present for my Grandma, who visit us, from far away.I gave her mine, a beige one that I just wore once, but I felt disappointed."
4.0,"The shirt was cute overall. However, I wish the the ties (wrap) were thinner the part that hangs. For size reference:  I am 182lbs, 5,8, 32H and I ordered a medium. Fits cool but there is a slight gap in the back just have to pull the shirt down then tie so it holds in place.  It did take a minute to receive it almost a month and the color was not the color grey in photo."
4.0,"Was supposed to use these for work, but got the wrong ones. It's ok. I look like a ninja wearing these 😂"
4.0,I like that this cloth removed tarnish with a minimal amount of rubbing.
4.0,I think they will look great when you wear heels.
4.0,"Thought I'd write a review since there were only 3 so far. First of all, this is a very beautiful dress; love the cotton fabric. High quality and very flattering. I ordered the pink Medium (my normal size in dresses). I'm 5'4"", 140 lbs. for reference. I could barely get it on over my head. I had forgotten about the zipper on the side, but in hindsight, I don't think it would have mattered. It was so tight I literally had trouble breathing. I thought that was the hard part, but boy was I in for a surprise when trying to get it off. I looked like a contortionist. I actually got a little panicky when it got stuck somewhere between my shoulders and my head. I ended up having to bend over completely and let out all of my breath to contract my chest some in order to get it off. Fortunately, my 15 year old cat was the only one in the bathroom during the grand performance. Not much amuses him anymore, but I'm pretty sure this did. My advice is to order up at least a size from your norm and use the zipper on the side in case it helps some in getting it on and off."
4.0,It fits a large soap dispenser food brush and sponge.  I've been using it for a few months and still no signs of rust.
4.0,"These serve their purpose - the new community pool wasn't sanded properly before opening and my kids were getting scrapes on the bottoms of their feet. With these on, their feet were safe. They also don't complain about walking across the hot pool deck with these on. These do slow them down in the water, especially if they're oversized. I ordered two sizes for my older son, and the smaller size seemed too small at home but turned out to be better in the water. Empty space in the shoe fills with water, so the snugger the better."
4.0,The material is very comfortable
4.0,Pretty cool device. Does it hold as much as I thought. But we will use it when we travel again.
4.0,beautiful shirt.  runs a tad bit small.  Size up and you will love it.
4.0,The material is good and the sizing is right.  I would buy again
4.0,"I am really glad I bought these.  I bought them to stay warm on my runs under my PT uniform and they do they job.  On my 30 degree (-1 C) run, it was a little cold when I went outside, but as soon as I started moving, these felt great.<br /><br />I normally wear a medium for my waist size (32 inches) bought a large and the waist fits great.  The inseam is a couple inches short (normally I wear a 34) leaving a 2-3 inch space between my 1/4 socks and the compression pants.<br /><br />The compression is new to me, but has boosted my ego.  The first time I tried to put them on, I heard a seam pop as I tried to pull them up over my leg muscles.  (180 lb, 6' 2&#34; runners build).  I put the blame mostly on me trying to pull them up like a normal pair of pants pulling at the waist (instead of like a pair of socks) rather than the quality.<br /><br />Compression is much better than the other brand I had tried for a little warmer temperatures."
4.0,It was actually a bit heavier and larger then I had imagined. My fault. I do wear it every day but feel like a rap star more then a follower of Christ..lol
4.0,"I love them, but keep in mind that I have a huge head and they fall off when I bend over. Nice for someone who gets headaches easy, no pressure on head!"
4.0,Lil heavier than I expected. They are nice tho. Real sparkly.
4.0,The dress is cute and comfortable. The size does run on the bigger side.
4.0,These are beautiful shoes but they show the top of the toes too much and are a little bigger than expected.
4.0,"It was hot but I cut the mouth out, didn't hold the heat and worked great.  I was even able to drink with no problem."
4.0,It was a gift. So not sure how it fits yet. It looked good and he liked it.
4.0,The style I liked the best and was kinda upset when I washed it it did not shrink
4.0,There earrings are beautiful. Loos better than I thought. A good buy.
4.0,I love my purse - got alot of compliments.  My only complaint is that the &#34;bling&#34; on the side fell off after two days.  I fixed it but it would have been nice if it had been a bit sturdier in application.  Otherwise - LOVE IT!!!
4.0,"This sweater is cozy and warm, perfect for winter time. The material is thick and heavy. Love he turtle neck design and the “big” look. It is a little sorter on the back but other Jan that is great. I ordered size S, I am 115 pounds and 5’2. Other colors are also cool"
4.0,"Somewhat small, but great dress!"
4.0,This is a cute costume and what we were looking for.  The only issue we have is the shirt is on the small side for the size L that we ordered.  It's supposed to fit a 10 year old but it's more like a size 6-8 year old.  We had to buy another shirt.  The sizing on the pants seems fine.
4.0,"Very nice material, super soft to touch. Colors are vibrant and look just like they did on my monitor. Bought a medium as that is what usually works for me in clothing and it fits great. 5'5&#34; about 135lbs. I'm slightly heavier than usual and they fit no problem. I don't believe losing any weight would affect it much. I do believe if you have a big booty though it might be a little tight. I haven't washed yet as I am concerned with running colors but as happy with price and product. Did arrive on the earlier side of expected arrival date though know it will be a month or two before receiving product. Item arrived in a envelope bag that fit in my mailbox.<br />Small edit, colors didn't seem to run and are still as vibrant after several washes."
4.0,"Like the range of colors but, earrings could be a bit larger."
4.0,I got the green one with flowers! The model must be wearing very high waisted shorts because it definitely shows your navel. I wish it was a little longer but if i'm feeling thin I'll probably wear it with my high waisted pants!
4.0,"Item is beautiful, functional. I expect it to hold up well (if there's no update, it's holding up very well). I'm glad I chose this, though I wish there wasn't a third bird (butt only) in the image. Haha. I am surprised how many of the peacock shower curtains had this, a partially imaged bird. Anyhow, it was a breeze the hang. Out of the box I took my hand held streamer and after 10 minutes it looks fantastic. You can't really tell without touching it that is is vinyl."
4.0,Fits great and is flattering. Received many compliments. True to size
4.0,Fits as expected. I am 5/2 120 lbs ... but the breast area was small on me but i made it work. I am a 34D so fairly large for being short and small figured... however i am sure a B cup would fit perfectly. Overall great product. I used it for a Halloween costume but could def use it in the summer if i wanted to do that as well :)
4.0,"Nice , warm, and long! Hopefully they won't shri k when washed."
4.0,"Solid construction. Ran a little smaller than I thought it would, but if you buy a larger size than you think, there are instructions on how to adjust it perfectly."
4.0,Runs a little large. I wear a size 7 and that's what I ordered but it's big on me. I should have gotten a 6.
4.0,Great graphic tee for Halloween. Colors look great. Shirt is very fitted. Just be aware for sizing.
4.0,"I really like these sunglasses for everyday use, except when I have an appointment with my optometrist and my eyes are dilated it's just not dark enough. Otherwise these are great."
4.0,I love it. It is very pretty blouse the only thi g is that it runs small. I ordered a large for my Mom and it did not fit her. I am a medium so I can wear it but just to tell you I am wearibg the large and it is a tiny bit loose for me but I am a small medium.
4.0,"Way cute suit, but the bikini top runs rather small. I don't have a big bust either... I'm a full B. I spill out the bottom a little bit, but will just remove the pads and hopefully it will be fine. I'm 5'5&#34; and around 125 pounds. I purchased a medium. The bottoms fit great and the drape part of the tank looks cute and isn't too baggy. Just needs a bigger bikini top."
4.0,"Very nice earrings--the color blend is very flattering, they are petite and are perfect for daily wear."
4.0,Very beautiful! Seems like it was well made and won't break. Wish the rhinestone part was longer but will do the job for my wedding
4.0,"Nice with a bit weight which I like because it won’t bend, but runs a 1/2 size small"
4.0,"I am a Sweeney Todd fanatic, and when I found this I fell in love. I neglected to read the length descriptions, and expected it to be about the length of a typical rosary. This fits like a loose choker, but the razor hangs just right. The razor is also smaller than I expected, but it is proportional to the rest of the piece. If you notice in the picture (before I ordered it, I didn't) there is an extension of the chain with an ST hanging from it. This is not noticable when wearing the necklace, and looks rather odd. Otherwise it is a great necklace and is very well made with great detail in the razor."
4.0,OK bag but would be better with outside pocket.  Change purse is not useful.
4.0,"Unit has Clear glass and green glass lenses, housing can be unscrewed to remove lenses"
4.0,I didn’t like the cotton feel on the inside of the jacket. I was expecting the whole jacket to be dri fit.
4.0,Liked getting a lot of leggings but wanted more standard colors that could be used with a variety of pieces. The purple leggings are hard to match with other outfits
4.0,"I love the blue of these. I don't like to wear the ""diamond"" ones in my nose but with the blue they look much better to me than silver. However, the posts and rings feel a bit flimsy. They're L-Posts so they don't fall out easily at least. Worth the money. I'll toss a few of ones to keep the bulk (and there's some fugly ones in there..."
4.0,Lindo todo pero muy suelto
4.0,"The color and make are really nice.  I have not given this hoodie a higher because I want to see how well it wears and if the fur like lining lasts. But just looking at it, I feel I have made a good choice."
4.0,Queda Perfecto solo que los roll up de las mangas son difíciles de amarrar. Y la tela está muy fea
4.0,This dress is very pretty. I just wish it was lined underneath.
4.0,"If this had fit me correctly, it would be the perfect sports bra. Other reviews mentioned it running small, but I took my chances and failed. Quality appears to be great, though! I’ll purchase the correct size in the future."
4.0,"I'm 6'1, 160 and usually a 30 in pants. I ordered these in a medium to account for having more freedom and the length. They did ride up shortly after washing but not terribly noticeable. I would order a size up if you're a stickler for length."
4.0,"I’m 5’ 3” weight 135 order a medium in leggings, these fit more snug and the material is thin.  Colors as shown, but not so cute on, thin."
4.0,Need to lose some weight to really look good in this.
4.0,Purchased a small as mediums are normal a little large on me. Wish I got a medium as they are a little tight in arms and chest. They are very thin but warm.
4.0,Very cute Christmas earrings.  Good quality for the price.
4.0,Update:<br />They company is sending a new purse. I changed the start from 1-4 rating for their customer service.<br /><br />I just received this purse and love the color and space. I was walking around a store and all of a sudden my bag falls to the floor and I pick it up and the part where the strap is sewn on some how wasn’t sewn right and it came off. I now can’t use this purse at all. Disappointed in this purse after reading all the great reviews it has. I want to try to contact company but don’t know how.
4.0,The slippers was a big Hit! We feel also the price was right. Thank you.
4.0,Beautiful but smaller than I spected.
4.0,I love the material!!!
4.0,"This little keychain has worked well.  The only issue was after several drops (which I seem to do frequently), the emblem piece fell off.  I was lucky to catch it and after a little gorilla glue it is back to good as new."
4.0,"There are 6 pairs of socks but only two separate pattern options. I love the socks as they are thick, elastic and of pretty good quality. These socks feel comfortable. I am a size 10 and I had no issues putting them on. I did wash the socks before using them - this is my standard procedure when buying new clothing items. No issues noted post washing. Overall really good socks. Recommended."
4.0,Comfy tanks for hot weather. They wash well. Just hang to dry. True to size.
4.0,Good shirt. Design is a little small
4.0,It's a little bit too small for my wrist but other than that I still love it.
4.0,"I loved the color and fit. BUUUUT .. I'm so short and I thought I'd be able to tie it at the bottom. But, this is a slinky material and it doesn't stay. Other than that it's so cute and has pockets!"
4.0,"They did not fit me well, so I gave them away as Christmas gifts.  Quality felt nice.  Looked nice.  I just picked wrong size for myself."
4.0,Very soft but very small.
4.0,Makes a nice option to change the look of a apple watch
4.0,"Fits way small, ordered a 42”, when I wear a 36-38”"
4.0,"Great-looking watch - can't tell that it's inexpensive at all.  Wish the band was leather, but looks and feels great.  I had another Monument watch previously that lasted FOREVER, so hoping for the same with this one."
4.0,I love it but it's more like a choker. Wish the actual necklace was longer.
4.0,Glasses were a perfect finishing touch to my son's Theodore Roosevelt's costume
4.0,Adorable Keychain.  I bought it for my cousin who is a photographer.  I gave it 4 stars because it's so tiny.  I wish the camera would have been a bit bigger.  Other than that it's Adorable!
4.0,"Cute shirt! After reading the reviews, I ordered 2 sizes larger than I would normally wear, and it worked out great! If you know that going into it, this is a great purchase!"
4.0,Lace around armpits wide!
4.0,"I purchased 4 sets of these - 2 kids loungers, 1 women's lounger and 1 men's lounger - for Christmas PJs.  I was surprised by the awesome quality.  These won out because POCKETS!!  All pj pants should freakin' have pockets!  Unfortunately, only the adult sizes have pockets though, and the poor kids are just left with no place to tuck their wee hands... so sad.  Also, the kids tops are made of fleece, while the adult tops are made of thermal material - it would be better if the kids tops were also made of thermal material versus the fleece (it sweats alot).  So removing 1 star because of cold hands and stinky bodies on the kids side - my kids still love these, but I'm the one doing the laundry.  ;)  Overall - great value for the price, and we love the adult sets - which the kids sets were a match to the adult sets exactly."
4.0,"This costume definitely runs small! I flip flop between small and medium, so I figured I'd be safe and go with a large, just because I had seen people saying the costume ran small, and they're right! I ordered a large, I'm 5ft-120lb and have a sorta wide/heavyish chest and I was worried I wouldn't be able to get the zipper up."
4.0,"Really nice watch.  Feels and looks great.  Would give it five stars but the color is not a vibrant blue as shown.  Very dark and looks almost black until out in sunlight.  Then only looks a really dark navy not the noticeable blue as pictured.  I have many Invicta watches so I purchased this one only for the blue color.  Still looking for a blue that I like since this one did not foot the bill.  However, I kept it because I like it.  Just the color is the only negative."
4.0,"This took a very long time to reach me BUT, I love this shirt it is BEAUTIFUL!! i would gladly buy it again! GREAT WORK!!"
4.0,Bought these for a Christmas present and they are well loved.
4.0,Got them sooner than anticipated! They're super cute on me but the only issue is that they are a little tight. But still an overall quality product for a good price
4.0,"For granddaughter, she was very pleased. It's nice to see my 18-year-old granddaughter in lace."
4.0,"I love the belt and I get a lot of compliments, but it is a tight fit. I wish a larger size was available. Quality is good!"
4.0,I like it a lot.  It's a little boyish but I wanted something that was just comfortable and it really is
4.0,Bought for my sons prom prom. Nice suit. Needed alterations. Overall good for the price.
4.0,Very cool bracelet for any gender!  The only issue is that I bought this for my son so the extra string beyond where it is tightened is kinda long. He doesn't seem to mind though.
4.0,"This dress fits great, but it's pretty snug. It looks great with a pair of heels. The back of the dress isn't very flowy but it would still work nicely for my engagement  photoshoot."
4.0,It's a gift. I like it.
4.0,My son got this for a girl he likes and she loved it.
4.0,Soft and stretchy. Runs small.
4.0,good deal if you lose or misplace your glasses a lot.
4.0,"I like wearing it, it's fun and dainty.  I get asked all the time if it hurt to get it and I say no and take it off to show it is just a cuff."
4.0,These laces are fire...but a bit short for my preference.
4.0,I'm 6 ft 175 lbs and bought an XL it fits pretty well could have a little more length but I am also so tall
4.0,This shirt was exactly what I expected.
4.0,Bought to go on a cruise.
4.0,My son was very pleased he got these shoes for Christmas.
4.0,"This is a cute scarf, it is a little thinner than I was expecting. It is similar to a cotton t-shirt material. It looks cute on though and a great option for a pop of color for a casual event or occasion. I ordered the fuchsia color and the color looks exactly as pictured from the seller. For the price it is a nice casual scarf."
4.0,The style and lace was very cute!  I felt it fit a little loose.  I ordered a size biggger and should have ordered my exact size.  It was comfortable and I received many complements on it.
4.0,"I own a LOT of merino wool socks. These Socks Daze socks are not at the same quality level as my beloved Darn Tough or Cloudline socks, but they are fairly close to the quality of Smartwool socks. That is to say, they are good enough for daily use.<br /><br />These particular socks are relatively thin, so perhaps not the best for keeping warm. But still good for wicking sweat and keeping your feet comfortable during a moderate walk or light hike.<br /><br />It's also nice that these are free from any unnecessary branding or fashion statements. Just basic, good quality merino wool socks."
4.0,These all came rather tangled but besides that the person who received them really liked them.  Will update if they break but otherwise they are a great gift.
4.0,I got this item for my daughter for an Amelia Earhart book report with oral presentation. The scarf is good quality and has no flaws in workmanship.
4.0,Great for those with large hips!
4.0,Great. Fabulous.  Great for the money.
4.0,"I really wanted these to work. The girl that pierced my daith couldn't get the earring in, so I just have 3 more earrings to add to my little stash. I may try a different shop and see if someone else can get 1 of them to work."
4.0,I bought this for my mom in law who loved it. The gemstones glittered prettily and was sent in a nice jewelry box.
4.0,This is a nice little piece.  I don't think it is as pretty or detailed as the picture (unless it's under a magnifying glass).  I can't get the clasp done once it's on and I can't put it on doing the clasp first; but it does stay on even without doing the clasp.  It is a simple piece that wraps twice around; and the wire seems to hold up well and is flexible - perfect for this bracelet.  It has some shine to it; but more of an antique look.<br /><br />I'm not sure quite how to describe it - a cheap little piece; but doesn't look really cheap.  I don't think I would buy it again; but it truly is a bargain for if you're looking for something casual and unobtrusive to wear.  I have worn it several times and have had no problems with the integrity of the bracelet.  However I can't say it's my all time favorite.<br /><br />Better than expected for and worth the $3 - Enjoy
4.0,These are lightweight and have a nice breathable but almost silky feel to the fabric.  I like that you get 4 in a pack at this price.
4.0,"I love this bra. It has changed my life. Very easy to put on and easy to clean. I've worn it multiple times now and it has held up really well, even when I vigorously jump around and in fairly warm weather.<br />My only complaints are that the inner and outer parts of the bra are starting to become less sticky so I'm afraid it'll loose its stickiness eventually. And I wish this bra came in multiple colors, maybe closer to my lighter skin tone so it would be more hidden when worn under thinner material.<br />I wear a B size bra and this fits me perfectly."
4.0,They are as advertised and fit fine. They are good for light support and of course being white they become soiled quickly.
4.0,The range says 3-10 but must lean either bigger 3-5 or would work better for average 8-9 years old. It was giant my 6 & 7 yr grandkids  This was quality.
4.0,"These rings are very light & comfortable.  I hardly motice that they're there.  I wear size 5 & 5.5 on my ring fingers.  They're a little big on my size 5 finger & fit best if I have them stacked.  I also tried them on my bigger fingers, size 7 & 7.5, & they fit pretty well without being too tight.  I'd say they will fit best on size 6-7 fingers.  The colors are bright & fun but there is a visible seam down the center of the ring."
4.0,"Really loved it, had it for almost a year before it broke, my husband fixed it but I guess not tight enough because next time I wore it I lost one of the clips.  Lots of compliments on it"
4.0,"The sleeves could be a couple inches longer, I’m sure that’s why the model has them rolled up... The buttons are really small and a bit difficult to keep your grip while buttoning.  But other than that it is somewhat thick material, soft and seems to have well sewn seems.  Comfy! I love the length to wear with my black leggings."
4.0,Definitely for kids.
4.0,Love this dress except the black in the top is not the same fabric as the bottom. The black in the polka dots faded after 1 wash whereas the bottom is vibrant.
4.0,I wear an 18 & so I ordered this in a 3X - it is a bit snug.
4.0,Love this dress! Super simple and so soft. It fits perfect and true to size
4.0,The drea is a little tight in the chest area but I'm a 36DD. I like the material. It's a little stretchy.  It's very flattering. The length is perfect.  I'm 5'3 and 155lbs. Size L
4.0,The cut and style is good. The fabric is thick but not very soft. It runs small if you have a tall kido.
4.0,Love it....only reason not giving it four stars.  Is you need to be careful of the little ball. Mine slipped off while putting it on and lost it. :'(  I do like how it is a complete circle when closed so it won't hook on anything.
4.0,"The Quality was just as expected.  Only thing I didn't like was how long it took to get it, but that's okay. Overall its a solid product."
4.0,Very pretty.  Absolutely no give or stretch in the waist.
4.0,Very cute...some rhinestones missplaced
4.0,Fits great! Very happy with purchase.
4.0,My son got these as a gift for one of his friends and she loves them.
4.0,"Smaller than I’d hoped, but I have small hands so I was able to make these work. No stretch of give at all, so if you can’t get them over you thumbs you’re not getting in."
4.0,It is comfy and does as I wanted it to do which was to have it as a sleeping bra.
4.0,"The rubber fiber in the woven fails after 5 month of use, however, good for the price"
4.0,"These tights are very cute and they fit me just fine, but there is not a lot of wiggle room. I'm 5'8"" and weigh 140 pounds and it still wasn't the easiest task to get them on. That being said, they DO fit, but I would just be cautious if you're in between sizes."
4.0,"Ran a bit larger than expected, but is what I wanted. Nice and soft, warm."
4.0,"I ordered this ring to wear in place of my real diamond wedding ring while we are out of the country.  It is beautiful and sparkly.  It does not turn my finger green and is not too huge on my finger.  It arrived quickly and fits true to size.  The only drawback is that the bottom of the wring was slightly misshapen, but nothing major.  I can tell because I know it's there but no one else would notice it."
4.0,"super cute pattern and good value, but I returned it because we are flying internationally and I was sure TSA and baggage handlers would rip it open"
4.0,"Cute dress, but a little big on me. I'm 5 feet tall and it hits the floor and puddles a little. More than that, it's just too big for my small frame overall."
4.0,Love this but had to get a different necklace than the one it came with.
4.0,"Very comfortable light. I got a size bigger based on some reviews and think I could have ordered true to size. I’m 160 5-5 I got xl, plenty of room if you like very loose fit. I’m going to order another one in L for second pair."
4.0,"Didn't know it had a little bell on the side where you close it, so it jingles overtime you move. Fits smaller than expected"
4.0,should've gone a size or 2 up.  very comfy though
4.0,Top is somewhat small.  I'm hoping a little 5-10 pound weight loss will make the difference.  VERY CUTE and will be my birthday outfit.
4.0,"[[ASIN:B0047EZVIQ Men's Classic Satin Boxer Shorts, Pack of 5 Printed Boxers, Sizes Small to 3XL]]My only complaint is that the rise is a little tight, so that I find myself tugging the shorts from between my cheeks.  Otherwise, I like them just fine."
4.0,Arrived very fast and really nice looking. Our school wanted to charge us $60 for a pin but I decided to save some money and get this pin.
4.0,"The clips hold well and don't damage my clothes.<br /><br />Only problem is the straps seem to be a little too short. I am 6'3'' and when I use the shirt stays, they are pulled so tight that the shirt is pulled unnaturally and uncomfortably. I tried them again with the longest shirt I own, and pulled my socks as high as possible, and I was able to use them in the back, but not in the front. I must say, I love having my shirt stay tucked in the back, but I wish I could wear then in front and back without worrying about them tugging my shirt by the collar. All in all will probably have to search for another brand with longer straps."
4.0,"A very cute charm indeed, however it is, VERY, very, small. I honesty think these are like small earnings. I dont think these 'arent' worth the price, but I do think it might be beneficial to add a picture, so demonstrate the exact size. Im very happy with mine, seeing as size would essentially, not matter, however for a more size delicate project, I can see several people getting angry, and I cant blame them. The charm is so very cute and well made, nothing comes apart, not even a notch where it was melded together."
4.0,I really like this product and i would recommend it to everyone that I know. If this is something that you are looking for get it because it's worth the money.
4.0,I am very please with the Grey Husky animal scarf.  These are very warm and so much fun. Only one down fall for this one is the material inside the paws was not sewn down and it is hard to get your fingers in the toes.
4.0,"Very cute. The material is not cotton, but is still breathable. Super cute, and great as a beach coverup."
4.0,I've gotten a lot of compliments on it it looks very good I just wish I could find one that didn't rub the metal off onto the dogs hair making it look all dirty
4.0,"I have received it,so wonderful!"
4.0,"Great choker, takes me back to the 90's when i wore them for the first time. After a ton of uses, it still hasn't broken."
4.0,I love this band but it does tend to get stuck on things n pulls at the wrist band
4.0,Dress runs a little large.  Might want the size smaller.
4.0,Product received as described. Beautiful bracelets
4.0,"I bought them for my partner but wished they were for me as soon as I unpacked the box. Even better, they're not much money for the amount of sunglasses.<br /><br />If I find he doesn't use them I'll take them on loan and give an update but it will be better for his sake if he does.<br /><br />One more thing- I have a small (but neural connection packed) head and my partner has an unusually large head but these fit us both. That's not always the case."
4.0,Earrings are very small but cute
4.0,The socks are super cute!! Only complaint is that one pair came and the middle was too tight and you can’t really wear them comfortably.
4.0,Runs little big<br />But very pretty nice material
4.0,I love this but I would definitely size down. I always wear a medium and this is to big on me.
4.0,"These are great and Super Comfy.  They shrank a little bit in the wash, but that is expected with all shoes, just means I have to break them in again, but after wearing a couple more times they should break in nicely."
4.0,"I get a ton of comments and love this. It is lightweight, gonna order more soon! I have lost a few rhonestones, the reason for 4 stars, which sucks but i still wear it."
4.0,"This is a nice, sturdy case. It looks good, and everything lines up when it's shut. Each pocket is large enough for one or two pairs of glasses, plus a cleaning cloth.<br />Sometimes rolling and unrolling can be a bit tricky-- the glasses can fall out of their pockets. But, overall, I like this travel case."
4.0,The costume fits well and is comfortable but the collar is rather floppy and annoying. Still a very good value for what you pay for
4.0,"Nice shirt, I recommend dry cleaning because it runs small"
4.0,"The gloves were a bit small, but still looked good."
4.0,"The color was off. I ordered what looked like burgundy and got red. Other than that, it fits great and I get so many compliments every time I wear it."
4.0,"The only reason that I gave this dress 4 stars is because it's a bit see-through. Otherwise, I love it."
4.0,I ordered a size up and it fits just right. I love this dress and I get a lot of compliments on it.
4.0,It’s cute. Not my favorite thing. Would have been better in black. Seems like good quality though.
4.0,Just received these and I like them. The sizing is perfect which has been a slight issue in the past for me with stone plugs. The biggest disappointment with these is that the Howlite plugs don't have dramatic black veining throughout like the image but they are still good looking. The Tiger's Eye and Jade look amazing.
4.0,Love this shirt! The shape of the neck line is perfect for me and the longer sleeves are very much appreciated. Haven't washed it yet but am hoping it holds up well because I want to buy another!
4.0,The are large which is what I was going for. I love the array colors and they go with a majority of looks and outfits. They are stretchy and soft. I love that both my 2 year old and 10month old can wear them. The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars was due to the fact that the bows come untied. I’ve  purchased a lot of Baby bows but none have been like this. I have to physically tie them back. This wasn’t a big concern but it never looks the same as the original product.
4.0,loved it.  too small.
4.0,"I bought this bag in black first and now the brown. The colour is a nice brown and actually looks like the picture. The stitching is not the greatest but for a bag under $10 I won't complain. It does the job of  holding my cell, house keys, car keys, money and a pen good enough. I will probably buy another 1 or 2 before the end of the year."
4.0,So pretty. fits as expected but it's soooooo long!
4.0,I ordered the hot pink/purple and got pastel pink but good quality. will make do
4.0,I recieve great compliments whenever i wear this
4.0,Cute. Description said that these were keychains even though earrings were pictured (I was hoping that they were earrings but it was a risk).<br /><br />Seller should consider updating description.
4.0,"I stand 5'3&#34;, weigh 128, waist measures 29&#34; and are hips 36&#34;.  I ordered a size medium. The fabric is soft, forgiving, and not transparent. The color is rich and even. Great skirt for hot, steamy, summer weather, overall a good value especially for the price. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because I had to return the skirt due to puckering at the waist owing to poor stitching."
4.0,These leggings are made with GREAT material and are NOT see through!  The only downside to these were that I ordered a medium  and they fit kinda large.
4.0,Awesome invention. Wish they were a bit looser.
4.0,"Great looking, very comfortable but a little smaller than expected for a small."
4.0,Very slimming.
4.0,It's pretty. No complaints
4.0,"Love the pants nice and flowy but, I ordered a large and the are pretty short so I cant wear them up where they go i have to pull them down so they hit my feet about 2 inches. I'm 5'8.5"
4.0,"I really like these earrings, even more than I thought I would based on the listing photo. I have worn them every day since I got them and while I do really like them, they have started changing colors and gotten uncomfortable when I clean my ears. For the price, this is what I would expect and I would definitely buy these. If you have extremely sensitive ears, I would probably look for a different pair ."
4.0,"This cami flattens and smooths some of my flab. However, sometimes my fat rolls just bunch up in other places. Overall, though, I think it is much better than any other slimming tank I have tried. The fabric is fabulous, too!"
4.0,"Wanted to give this 5 stars but the clam really was way too big. When I put my head in, I barely touched the sides. It felt like someone had worn it before me - like it was &#34;well used&#34;. It also had a very funny smell to it.. more biological then chemical. It really was something else. The other guys at the weekly LAUGH (L.A. Underwater Guild Hall) meeting said I had the best costume though."
4.0,I would give 5 stars but waist elastic is a little tight.
4.0,It was pretty good just an obstructed view as only the top section you could see through. DO NOT leave it in the heat it melts. It also does not take to most paints very well but it is made very well and i definitely recommend it for the price
4.0,"I bought an extra large so it would fit over shirts comfortably and it fits as expected. Light weight, stretchy material. Perfect for a light office sweater for the summer"
4.0,"Really beautiful shirt. However, sleeves are short for tall women so keep that in mind."
4.0,"Nice soft supple leather, but it was too small for what I needed it for. That's not a knock on the quality...it was very well made."
4.0,"These are brilliant in design- and bad in execution. The posts are not user friendly, it took two of us to get them in, and in doing so, we feel like we could have broken them easily. I love the design- and the size. Good for the price."
4.0,"This necklace is surprisingly pretty for the price.  I live in the southwest where jewelry is a major part of our lives.  Most of my pieces are very expensive.  When I wore this to lunch with &#34;the girls&#34; last week, I got many compliments, including a compliment from a women who makes jewelry.  I highly recommend this necklace.  It is lovely.  The chain is not the best quality...it's rough and the charm sticks on it a little...but I like that it is adjustable.<br /><br />I received this piece at a discount in return for an honest review."
4.0,The skirt is not long like pictured. It is really thick nice material. I’m wearing the shirt with high waisted jeans. I ordered a small and Im 135  and 5 2”
4.0,"A little darker than I was hoping for; however, I plan to use these in my vehicle when driving near sunset and into the sun when it  is directly in my eyes. It should work well for that."
4.0,"I bought these because I swear it showed bib pants and jersey in the picture (it doesn't now).  I bought a pair of thermal bib pants and they were awesome and fit with room to spare, so I thought I'd order a ""kit"".  I ordered a 3XL, which is what I got for the bibs and they fit with room to spare.  But Itried these on and the pants are way smaller than the bibs.  I had to return them, but if these pants are anything like the bibs (and if the pants fit properly), they are very good cycling pants.  I've done a few rides in below freezing temps and my legs were very warm.  The jersey seems very nice as well.  I went ahead and ordered a jersey in blue to match my bibs.  But the quality of this gear is exceptional"
4.0,"The belt is great quality, but it is a little wider than I expected making it difficult to go through the loops easily."
4.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / ordered a large<br /><br />Still can’t decide if I like this or not. I don’t think it’s very flattering on me, the bottom was a little tight so the slit looks stretched and the fabric isn’t great quality. Straps are adjustable and the pattern is cute though."
4.0,"Good fit, quality and transaction"
4.0,Great suit for the money! I had to send back the first one because too big. I wear a size 38c bra and the right size for me was xl. Ans definitely big enough.
4.0,"Second day wearing socks. So far so good. Very affordable, I like the different options. I wear size 15 so they are little on short side for my liking. But so far no complaints."
4.0,These fit great and look good but after only having them a month one has already broken.
4.0,Was not as easy to clip on to my glasses as other clip on I have used
4.0,"This is a wonderful headband and I love it, with one exception, it's just too tight.  I am a small person; 4'10"", so I don't have a large head.  It's so tight that I can't get it over my head without messing up my pony tail.  It would be ideal for a windy day as it's not going to blow off.  It's so good looking and so soft, I just wish it was bigger around.  I even tried to stretch it out, but it won't stretch much, at all.  It doesn't seem to get me a headache once on.  If it wasn't so tight I'd definitely get one in every color."
4.0,Tint could be a little darker but no complaints. Want better? Pay for more expensive shades.
4.0,Super light and cool really like them
4.0,good fit just a little fragile
4.0,"The wearer claims it is a little tight under the arms, but otherwise likes it."
4.0,This product would be good if it was children's sized.  Any small adult or tall child would live this if they're an anime fan.
4.0,The fit is shorter than I expected. The sleeves were the right size and I like the light material.
4.0,"Love it. It’s supple and soft and even though it’s a little bigger than  I thought, it is very warm and comfortable. More comfort than sleek"
4.0,This is a great Henley.  It is a bit form fitting which is exactly what I was looking for.  The material is soft with a little bit of stretch to it.  For reference I am 6’2 and 180 pounds and I got a medium.
4.0,I wish I didn't have to return this item. It's a bit small...I will reorder as soon as I ship this one back.
4.0,I bought to wear under shirts that are see through. Works well for that but they are a little snug for the size. Wash well.
4.0,"kind of a big case, But it will work."
4.0,"I have been living in this black maxi dress since I got it. It's so comfortable. It's casual enough to wear anytime, but also can be dressed up if need be. My only concern is that after about 4 washes, the top part is getting a bit see-through. Fabric was thin to start, but I'm afraid it might be unwearable after 4 more washes. I hope that isn't the case."
4.0,Finally found a cotton blend bra that is comfortable and holds its shape under “stress”😉. And love the option to make it a crossover in the back!
4.0,"Love style but runs big. 135Lbs 5'4, small was big, more wide . Def not snug fitting."
4.0,"These are well made, just didn’t fit so they went back"
4.0,It runs a little big.. Cute leggings tho
4.0,"Very beautiful dress, wonderful quality; however, I purchased the wrong size and ended up having to return the item.  The customer service department and shipping time for this item was great from the start to the finish.  The item definitely runs a little big, so if you are in a hurry, make sure and order the smaller size.  I need a the dress for a wedding, the weekend after I ordered, so I didn't have the time to exchange for a smaller size."
4.0,loved the socks at first .. and really still do because they are so easy to put on.  But then they slide down into your shoes or boots.  so I'm not sure I will order them again
4.0,"I love the bracelet! The design is modern. I have a small wrist so this fits, but I could see it being too small for someone with a larger wrist. See the photo. If not for that,  I would have given 5 stars.<br /><br />Timely delivery and packaged well."
4.0,Mine might have just been a bad seam. It was too itchy to wear …
4.0,LOVE it but I ordered one size too big so I'm gonna shrink it. Soft material comfortable and sexy. True to size don't order a size up like I did.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:591ca394bf080c5602643bf212975bd0]] I ordered based on the size chart and it fit perfectly! The tail is almost fully posable with the exception that it is long and heavy so it'll drag a touch. There's a ring on the back of the jacket so you can attach the tail to prevent that! The fabric on the shirt is a little rough but it should be fine if you wear an undershirt or tank top. All in all, this purchase was perfect for an upcoming convention I'm going to!"
4.0,"Great fit, extremely comfortable and great support! Breathable and doesn't chafe."
4.0,"Not bad, should be a little thicker but good."
4.0,Super cute. Too small- I will exchange for one size up. I'm 5'4 135lbs  - the size 8 is too small. I will try a 10.
4.0,Bought this golf shirt for my wife who has a great figure and is fairly robust in the top section. It is fitted so it shows her curves nicely. I don’t have as good of a round as I usually do when she wears this.
4.0,"Well made, comfortable and subtle design. Logo is minimal and it appears to be high quality.<br /><br />My only complaint is the unnecessary bottle openers on the soles. Reef has had this feature for many years but I can't remember ever using the bottle opener or ever seeing anyone else use it. If you walk on mud the gap gets filled up with it and its basically just a hole on your sole. At the very least, one opener on one sandle would have made sense but there is an opener on both soles. No one needs a beer bottle opener ever. There are many techniques for opening beers without them. You can even fold a piece of paper over and over and use that. Or just the edge of a table, another beer bottle, teeth etc. Just Google it. Reef, please make it an option to add the openers.<br /><br />Otherwise, great sandles."
4.0,Hard to get out of
4.0,It is perfect size for ballgames. Love it!
4.0,"constructed well,could have been 1/4&#34; taller"
4.0,Hoodie is cool but the pic of Kobe isn't that good but I am satisfied with it. It is warm and cozy even though it is on the thin side. I like the polyester and overall feel of it.
4.0,"These are good fitting pants.  I was a little nervous regarding shrinkage based on other reviews, but didn't find this to be an issue.  I have black and blue pair - both fit well.  I can wear an 8 or 10 in pants.  I am 151 and 5'4.  The size 8 in these were perfect.  They do have a bit of a 'sheen' to them, but nothing freaky looking.  My only complaint - I have washed several times now  (at least 18 times) -  and the elastic threads within the material are actually beginning to stick out of the material.  Mainly around the seams of the pants.  I tried pulling them out, but they are within the material itself<br /> It is VERY noticeable so I now need to wear the pants with long shirts. - but prior to this - the pants were excellent"
4.0,Beautiful top.<br />I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and ordered a size to big to fit and then another size to big to be loose.... I strongly recommend doing this.
4.0,We'll made and really cute!
4.0,"The material this dress is made from is very flimsy.  I wore it with leggings, as it is a shorter length.  It, probably, won't be long enough for a tall individual.  It worked as my attire for Red Dress Day for Womens Heart Health, on February 5th, 2021."
4.0,Super cute and flattering. The only complaint I have is dress is kind of thin.
4.0,"Beautiful design, just remember to check the size and weight.  It is much larger and heavier than I expected."
4.0,"Good wallet, lots of space. Only thing is one of the zippers fell off like the third day using it, I was able to put it back on but still kind of loose and could probably fall off at any point."
4.0,Was looking for a slightly bigger size for my sister but overall they are really nice and gifted it to someone else
4.0,Good quality tutu for costume runs!
4.0,"Looks nice given the price, our daughter had a lot of fun with it at renaissance festival"
4.0,"The leggings are comfortable, fit perfectly, and also very inexpensive. Since I just got them I can not address if they last long. If they do last this is a super good purchase."
4.0,These fit my ten year old pretty well. although I wished that the fuzzy part around the wrist were stretchy. If her hands were a little bigger these would not fit because of that.
4.0,"Update- not real wood, and they make my ears itchy and dry. Still really cute but will be getting something different"
4.0,Looks very nice and heavy. The chain might not last long but overall a great item.
4.0,I ordered this hat to complete my costume as Easy E on Halloween. It can exactly as pictured and is well made.
4.0,I bought this for my son's birthday and he is going to love it. He has been wanting it for awhile so it will be a good surprise. The only problem I had was when I tried the try me button it didn't work. I was thinking he was going to be so disappointed. I purchased new batteries hoping that was the problem and found the batteries in the toy were upside down. Thankfully that fixed it and now I have extra batteries. Overall I am happy with my purchase.
4.0,I think it's true to size just wish it was a little longer.. but i actually bought this to work out in and it's almost tooo fancy looking for that... really like the free flow..
4.0,"Material is lightweight but sturdy, very comfortable. I bought 2 pair-first larger size seemed baggy, so bought a size smaller which was way too small. Belt was a nice touch."
4.0,"This item is gorgeous, unfortunately I fall a little too outside the range of one-size-fits-most. I would not feel comfortable wearing this out until I lose a little more weight, but it does fit. If someone else is bigger and more comfortable with tighter fitting items, they could totally pull this off.<br />The color is beautiful and the pattern is flattering to all body sizes. I'm very short, and this still fell nicely. I also liked the arms. They are the butterfly-type arms, but they fit nicely. Those type of arm holes tend to look funny on my body-type, but these work. They have enough room to not squeeze my arms, but are not so roomy that they make my upper half look larger.<br />THIS IS LOW CUT, however, most beach coverups are. If you wanted to wear this as a top or dress, you need to wear a tank top or be prepared to show tons of cleavage. If you are not busty, then you might not pop out, but I think you still might want a tank on underneath.<br />The material is silky and the item is lightweight and well made. It came in a really nice pouch too.<br />One MAJOR POSITIVES of this item is the quality in seeing the item so that the pattern of the material is even and symmetrical. The arms match and the pattern lines right up in the middle of the dress. Many companies don't take the time to ensure this happens, and it is much appreciated at this price point.<br />Overall I am in love with the item, the only drawback is it comes in one-size and not everyone can fall into that category. (Iam about 5'1 and 190lbs. for reference.) I do not blame the product for this, but it is good information to know.<br /><br />I recieved this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I am happy to answer any product questions."
4.0,Excellent style. White band a bit over the top but suit is great. Not a &#34;Speedo look&#34; nor goofy & baggy trapping air in water. Very comfortable.
4.0,My boots are wet but they dry out quickly on the boot dryer
4.0,Nice room lounge or pajama. So soft!
4.0,"I like the quality, color and design of the pants. My  complaint is the right hand pocket is small but I realize it is made for a phone only, not large enough for a wallet or your hand."
4.0,Amazon should tell where these garments are manufactured to allow consumers to judge size needed.
4.0,"XXL fits like XL.  Maybe it shrunk some.  Still, good quality cotton.  I just stretch it out some prior to wear."
4.0,"This hanging toiletry bag is a must have for bathroom organization, it allows you to carry everything you need for the bathroom in one convenient bag. Its large enough to fit many standard size bottles, such as body wash, shampoo, and conditioner, along with deodorant, and thinner items, such as wipes, cloths, etc... It also has side pockets that are large enough to either fit another 2 bottles, or in my case, shaving cream, razor and blades in one pocket, and toothpaste, toothbrush and floss in the other. The hook securely hangs the bag even with &#34;heavy&#34; items in it. The bag has great construction, even when packed to the brim with stuff, the bag seems to be able to handle it, the zippers close securely. Being black, its stylish and can fit with any persons bathroom without clashing with style or color. The bag is convenient for people who share a bathroom such as a dorm or apartment, or to store essential bathroom items when travelling. This product was purchased at a discount in exchange for a review."
4.0,Its a pretty bracelet and it looks just like the picture. It was delivered on time.
4.0,The fit is fine. Durability is yet to be tested. Stitch quality is not great. It’s functional and cute.
4.0,"It's alright, the are definitely better startups available,  but for the price,  it looks okay and does the job."
4.0,useful product
4.0,"It's absolutely gorgeous. The fit is a little tight, but you can bend it to make it work"
4.0,Arrived in good shape .. Love it. Thank you!
4.0,Love the material moves with you
4.0,Since u don’t have the talks anymore I had no choice but to buy regulars. They definately don’t fit as well as the talks.
4.0,"More pockets (such as front pockets) would be VERY useful.<br />The Royal Robbin discovery skort is very comfortable, it is the most comfortable I have worn, much more comfortable than the Scott Vest brand.  However, it has no front pockets.  My older versions have one back pocket, my newer versions have 2 back pockets.<br />The fabric lays well and looks nice enough to wear to work (where the dress code is business casual).<br />I suspect the older versions are lighter weight (but it could be that my older one's were bought used, and may just be more worn).  My older versions are slightly more comfortable than my new one.<br />Sizing has not been consistent over the years.  I have an older version size 12, that is slightly big, but the newer version size 10 is too small, while the newer version size 12 almost fits (very slightly tight, but ok).  I have another older version size 12 that is a perfect fit."
4.0,"I want to love this, but the shoulders and sleeves were too large. The shoulders sat an inch about my actual shoulder. The waste was also too large, but fit right in the hips."
4.0,"Good shoes. My son shuffles his feet when he walks, so shoes don’t last long. These lasted about 6mo, which is about average for him even for more expensive/name brand shoes."
4.0,fits great but the sleeves were a bit snug
4.0,Love the shoes but thought they cost more than they should have.
4.0,"It's not as soft as I thought it would be, still comfy tho! Super cute, but the front straps don't match up with where your bra straps sit. I wish it was a touch longer."
4.0,"Ok glasses just cheap,good throw away glasses"
4.0,Great backpack for my son and we get so many compliments!
4.0,I love it. Very cute. Very sturdy
4.0,Very nice fit and fabric.
4.0,"My girls love these shoes. They are beautiful and comfortable, which is what we have been struggling to find! However, they are a size bigger than we expected, so that's a bummer. The good news is that they can be wore even though they are large because of the strap."
4.0,Very cute item but the coloring is a little off. Item was a bit too big for my kiddo.
4.0,We didn't get the design shown...what's with that? V comfortable with turtleneck but not like the prettier one shown.
4.0,Great for polishing jewelry.
4.0,"This jacket will make a nice addition to my Spring and summer wardrobe. I was actually expecting it to be a bit heavier weight... somewhat denim like. Much to my surprise,  it is more like a blouse type fabric. It will be great for layering over thinner tanks or tshirts. The colors are quite vibrant. It is really quite pretty."
4.0,Very nice and beautiful. I love it.
4.0,Very nice but I had to upgrade the chain. The one it came with was to thin.
4.0,They work well but don't stay attached well
4.0,The dress is cute with great length and as a bonus the fabric was of excellent quality.
4.0,"I bought one for myself and my aunt.  They are very nice, and haven't tarnished.  The chain is worthless, but its the pendant I bought anyway.  We both love them."
4.0,Was ok for a school group costume the shirt was very stretchy sleeves were a bit long but good value for price
4.0,"The color of the dress is a lil darker than I wanted, overall it is cute, I am 5'8 and 115 LBS, I have small boobs, and I did find that this is a bit loose up top for me. I bought a small but could have used an XS on top. However, my bottom aka butt is bigger so a smaller one would have made it too short. I like he dress overall and can wear it with a strapless bra which is what I will do. It is perfect for a picnic with sandals."
4.0,Warm lines wish the sleeves were a little longer.
4.0,Such a simple sexy dress that can be dressed up or down. Only down fall is there two layers of material and it causes the seems at top to roll over and show the under layer. Other then that I love it! I’m 5’8 170 athletic and the Medium made th waist to booty ratio look amazing!
4.0,This is a great hat that looks good and packs well. Easy to keep with you for sun or rain protection.
4.0,Very pretty but came with a few of the rings off and one of the flowers a piece broken off . Why don't they fasten the rings properly
4.0,"I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work for me, because it's nicer than I expected for the price.  It's a nice stretchy jersey type fabric.  I'm 5'7"", 145, usually wear an 8 or 10.  I have an hourglass type shape, a little bigger in the hips, so I got the large.  The dress was too big for me at the waist, and while it did fit through the hips, the pockets made a slight bulge in the hip area that made me look saddlebaggy.  I had to return it and was sad to have to do so.  The dark blue color is very nearly purple, like an iris flower.  Definitely not navy blue."
4.0,Had to use a bit of super glue on the top since a few pieces of the straw were broken.  Can't tell that we fixed it.  My son loves this hat. I am making new bands for it too.  Bought the elastic and will do a quick sew so that he can change the band out to what he is wearing.
4.0,Its a good strap for the price cant complain.
4.0,Strap and metal keepers are excellent metal quick release to watch are meh at best needs the composite releases that come with the silicon bands. Yes I don't seem to be able to wear the silicon bands as they don't breathe causing skin issues looking for an even better nylon mesh/ woven band.
4.0,The dress is very comfy.  I got a medium which is the size I usually wear.  It ran a little big. I should've ordered a small.  Overall I love the dress.
4.0,Look exactly like the pictures.  These were a hit at Christmas.  The only drawback is that they are quite warm.
4.0,"The reason I did not rate this a 5 star is the soft water bottle.....what a waste.  ended up pulling it out, using the pocket for my cell phone an inserted a Camel Bak bladder.  The soft water bottle (a) is hard to insert, even when filled (b) cannot drink from it while running, and (c) would have to pull it to drink from it and then struggle to put it back in the pocket.  Otherwise, the vest is excellent.  Finished a tough 7 mile run over Kennesaw mountain and the vest fit perfectly, no bounce, but the manufacturer needs to redesign the soft water bottle.  try inserting a longer straw, or make it a firm bottle that would be easier to get in and out"
4.0,They are sooo cute!
4.0,I bought these boots for my wife and she loved them but they were too small even though they were a  half size bigger than her normal shoe size. We had to return them and didn't want to risk getting another pair that would have been 1.5 size bigger than her shoe size as they didn't come in 1/2 size increments. Seemed like a great boot and looked great but I would get at least 1 size larger than your normal size. It's difficult to rate a product based on size.
4.0,Casual sweater that looks a little bit like a sweatshirt material. It’s washed up decently. It’s nothing special but OK for average daily wear. Nice neutral for my husband.
4.0,"5'1&#34;, 128lbs, I got small size, perfect fit. The material may be a little thick, they may be a little, too warm for hot summer beach area. But overall I love the design, its shape and length of the dress. I am very happy wit this item."
4.0,A little large but love them!
4.0,"I gave 4 stars because it's really cute, and not a bad bra if it fits. Was just too small for me. I wear a 38d and I could squeeze into it, but I definitely won't wear it. The front is stretchy, but not the straps or the back lace part. I recommend removing the pads from the front, they make it loook funny. I'll give it to my niece or someone. It's a good bra, just for smaller women"
4.0,I like that it's a pretty good price and availability 👌
4.0,My other KS purses are soft and flexible this one is very stiff.  Just needs to age I hope.  Size is perfect
4.0,"Beautiful colors, runs a little small."
4.0,They are beautiful. Color is also pretty. Gave it 4 because feathers keep on turning upside.
4.0,"The coral color on the side of the frame stands out more than I would like and the lenses aren't polarized.  Luckily,  I didn't pay full price and I understood what I was getting so I feel like I got a great deal.  But really,  the gold and coral is a little weird..."
4.0,Comfortable to wear around the house. Keeps feet warm.
4.0,"The color is as shown and is beautiful.  It's a nice feeling satin robe that has a inside tie as well as a sash.  Though, being satin, it doesn't hold the robe shut as well.  The sleeves are wide, which can get in the way with certain activities.  The length is great, hitting above the knee. I ordered this when pregnant, and used it in the hospital after delivery.  It was easy to open and breastfeed without totally untying. It's cheaper than some lesser quality ones you'd find at the store.  I would recommend."
4.0,I bought this for a Christmas gift and it was nice.
4.0,Good quality.  The bottoms are very flattering.  The belt part hides the tummy and the butt cut is just enough to still be sexy without being obnoxious. The top is large and gaps under the armpits. If you don't have big breasts you really have to tighten the straps to the max. I'm a 34C. See picture.
4.0,"I purchased these for an ice skater Halloween costume. They worked perfectly for the costume! I was thinking I might add these into my regular wardrobe after Halloween, but the leather-like material is a bit wrinkled, on the tops of the shoes and around the toes, making them look cheap.  These shoes were very comfortable to wear dancing for 4+ hours."
4.0,I love this skirt its high waisted it’s a beautiful color and amazing shape I love the 1950s feels I get! it has one flaw the BELT it is a one size Fits most kind of thing and smells horrible but I am going to purchase a different belt and Probably just donate the on that comes with it.
4.0,"This is a very light weight long rain jacket.  Just what I was looking for - easy to pack. The various ties are not up to snuff though, all ragged ends and not finished."
4.0,Good product and came quick.  Wish it came with a screen protector and had a different type of clasp.
4.0,I make jewelry and use split rings rather than jump rings. I was happy to receive the product quickly. They are an item I was looking for at a good price.
4.0,"bigger than expected, few pockets inside.  good quality"
4.0,"Way too big. I’m a true 36A and this 36 even the most inside closure it still feels 2 inches too big. I have to size down 34 hoping for a better fit and worst case I can use extensions. I never thought a Chinese brand will actually fit too large. However, the material and style are wonderful and top notch so I’m excited to have a fitted one mailed to me soon."
4.0,I wear 44DD and I didnt need to wear an extra bra beneath it
4.0,It came fast. Great color selection. No the best quality but just OK.
4.0,"I would have given a 5 but it’s not 5 star fabric and I thought it was black bottom with white polka dots and it’s not. It’s navy blue bottom, so look closely as it’s somewhat deceiving. it’s very nice but not like a dress you’d buy at Lane Bryant where they have thicker material. On the flip side I absolutely loved this dress! My first time ordering clothes for myself through amazon and it’s worth it!! I can buy 3 dresses for the price of one at Lane, so it’s worth it. I’m a size 18 so the 2X fit well. Just perfect! I’ll probably order a ton more because it was so dang cute and you can’t se through it in the Sun, I had my husband check😂"
4.0,"Great hat, my child loved it!"
4.0,This fit as expected....the color is true to Navy and matched my dress perfectly.  Very comfortable.
4.0,Love the shoe... Got many compliments on it. Am going to order the black ones
4.0,A little too big but very nice
4.0,"These are amazing for the price you pay. I wish I would have ordered a Medium size which I will probably do. I ordered a small, I am 5'8 & 135 & I think they were a little shorter then I would like. The zipper is pretty high up as well which I wasn't expecting. I would totally order another pair & most likely will. Also, I do not understand why people say the packaging is great because it totally is not."
4.0,"These are really cute shoes and well designed, however they aren’t as soft in the soles and i thought they would be. They felt similar to memory foam for the first few days then went flat and felt like I was wearing a pair of my flat sandals."
4.0,"I so wanted this dress to be right as I love Toad&Co products.  Not only are they staples with their classic styles but they last too.  I am usually an XS in their products but the small was on sale so I gave it a try thinking a little room wouldn't hurt as my XS are body hugging (in a good way).  While it did almost sorta fit, what didn't fit was where the waist cut in.  I have a short torso and am only 5-3 no matter what size I am and with it hitting so low, but not really hitting anywhere in particular, it made my body look weird and accentuated the rest of the dress having a little too much room.  In my opinion, the dress is cut to really fit you.  It's not going to be anything skin tight but there isn't a lot of play in the design if you are too short/tall or have short/long torso.  Most of you ladies will not have this issue and it really is a lovely piece and the color is something different but not TOO different.  My SO actually still really liked it on me and wanted me to keep it so even not fitting right, it still looked good to him."
4.0,Product fit
4.0,"I'm 5'3&#34; about 160 lbs, normally wear a L/XL, and this dress fit me almost perfectly. Anyone a bit bigger than me may not be able to fit. But I loved the fit and it seems like a cute, cool dress for this summer."
4.0,People like this one.
4.0,It like it! I wish there was a size between 2 and 3 since I’m between those. 2 is too big 3 is too tight. But I like it!
4.0,"Just a bit too big for me. Use while playing golf. After warming up, they started to slide down my arms."
4.0,I love the shirt but I was a little disappointed that the picture is not exactly like the one I received. It's not as long as I would have liked and the back has a hem down the middle (does not have one on their main picture). The quality of the shirt seems to be very well made so I will continue to purchase from them.
4.0,Really nice bag.  Ordered it as s gift. Larger than I expected .
4.0,"The dress I received was not the black and white one, I received the one with the brown/red multi colored moroccan type pattern. Luckily I don’t mind those colors and patterns and will still wear the dress.  It is a bit long for me though, otherwise fit is very comfortable."
4.0,o like it
4.0,I like it. If I have know it stretched I would have gotten a size smaller. My bust is big but it fit perfectly. Would buy another Coke but size smaller.
4.0,"great investment to help your luggage stay secure.  the only comment i have so far is the D-ring, it did not last the round trip.  the plastic ring securing the excess length broke on the return trip.  i don’t know how the airport handled our luggage but it was missing when it came out of the conveyor.<br /><br />nonetheless, i recommend this product."
4.0,Liked them other then they look a little cheap made.
4.0,love em had to cover my tattoos at work and these were perfect because i can just slip them on and not wear an annoying undershirt that makes me to hot. only thing id like more is if they were a little thighter around the top and elastic like the compression sleeves bowlers wear.
4.0,The gloves are nice but they aren't true touch screen gloves as advertised.
4.0,A bit hard to move around in but I can still use my knee braces for it! I decided to use these pants for a Mello cosplay from Death note!
4.0,"Very satisfied. Haven't had for very long, so cannot address durability. Have worn for several days and very pleased with the look and ease of wear."
4.0,Fit wasn't what I expected
4.0,Pretty and versatile.
4.0,it makes my glasses fog up
4.0,"Belt works great after you get used to it. The extra strap going under instead of the belt takes a bit of getting used to as, especially getting it adjusted. But once you get used to it, it works as designed and keeps your pants up. It is also great for traveling, as you dont need to take it of for security. A warning to pet owners, get a lynt roller as the belt attracts fur."
4.0,This is a nice pouch. The zipper is solid and should like a long time with normal use.
4.0,"Exactly what I wanted and expected. Packed well to protect shape. Open and wear. There is no inside lining or band so there was small gaps at temples. However, that was great as it allowed ventilation to my head. Looks top quality."
4.0,"Sleeves fit well but the torso is a little short. Jacket itself is nice, zippers aren't cheap and is comfortable for the price."
4.0,I bought 6 pairs of these as gifts for coworkers. I thought they were very high quality for the price and a fun party favor. They arrived individually wrapped and in great shape.
4.0,Lightweight material that is not see through or flimsy.  Good quality and nice fit.
4.0,It would've been five stars but there was a hole by the bottom of the zipper that I had to sew up. Nice fit.
4.0,will be a nice welcoming gift for a friend coming to visit
4.0,"This is a really cute dress, I ended up buying in in all 3 colors because they are so economical and I love the style!  I am 5'5"" and 125 pounds (with a small chest) and I ordered the XL.  I know, that seems ridiculous but I love the flowy style, and it fits rather well on my shoulders even as an XL...the length for me is almost too short for a 48 year old, but I wear all three colors with white jeans and wedge sandals and get lots of compliments!  It's a very flirty, fun, effortless dress/tunic for summer.  I only have one design complaint: the seam in the front of the dress comes to a point right at the bottom of your belly (basically your crotch), so even if you have a flat stomach, this doesn't make things look better.  I'm all for baggy/flowy/bohemian garments, and I never think that these type of tunics make women look large if they aren't, but this seam is just a tad misplaced.  Maybe I'm the only one that notices, though!"
4.0,These were very well made and super comfortable but they are definitely made for wide feet. Sadly had to return them
4.0,"Really cute, but a tight in the chest.  More for a junior or young teenager."
4.0,Baby slept on this a lot when he was small. It is a little bulky for a travel changing pad but we loved using it at home and the larger mattress pad as a blanket to play on or for naps before he was mobile. It is very soft and good quality. Has held up for many washings.
4.0,"Really nice inspection gloves at a good price. I use mine mainly while smoking a meerschaum pipe, but good for a lot of hobby uses."
4.0,She loves it. The tool is separate between the colors meaning it’s more like a grass skirt than I continuous skirt. It’s showing some wear so my mom did a little mending. Overall the kiddo is happy.
4.0,Muy bonitos pero se despego rapido
4.0,These are really big. I have a wide head and most sunglasses do not fit so I thought I'd give these a try. First they are wide enough to fit my head without squeezing my temples. As someone said the nose bridge is pretty big but I can still wear them without the glasses sliding down. The temple is really long but they are snug in the back so they are not loose. For $15 and change they will do for a while.
4.0,This skirt is gorgeous! It looks better in person than the picture and is definitely worth the purchase. I received it very quickly in the mail.  I'm so glad I got this skirt
4.0,"This velour zip-up hoodie and pant set is great. The zip-up hoodie has 2 pockets so you can either use it for your hands or use it to keep your phone or other things in it. The jogger pants also have two pockets which basically can serve the same purpose if you want. They have a draw string so you can tighten them to fit perfectly and that they don't slip down.<br /><br />This is perfect to lounge around at home or for quick casual errands to run around town, personally to me that is acceptable like getting groceries. These are true to size and fit really well. This outfit is nice and comfortable and I really like to lounge around in it, nice in the winter especially so you can keep the heating bill down."
4.0,"I've ordered this watch several times b/c my husband loves it. Price is good, looks expensive,watch just doesn't last long, either stops or has another mechanical issue. Because of price and how it looks when it stops I order another one. First one made it to 2yrs. and stopped,second one he lost. This is 3rd one I'm sending it back it keeps stopping on Him. Warranty is good on watch."
4.0,We had a Starry Nights themed fundraiser last night. The skirt was a hit! The material is obviously not top of the line but it was very comfortable. The zipper did pop open when I got home and was changing so now it is broken BUT it was a one time event so it was still worth it!
4.0,Pants are a nice smooth comfy material. My only negative is they look more grey then black.
4.0,"This is a cute, flattering top.  Fits true to size, and the sleeves are long enough for me (I'm 5'7""), but the white one is just too sheer.  I sent it back, but I loved the style.  I think a color would be fine."
4.0,Color is not green as shown in picture.  I also do not like the shirt arms.  It’s not a good fit for me.
4.0,Nice looking dress for a costume party. And for the price I am very satisfied. Getting the correct fit was a challenge. Had to return two dresses before getting it right. I had to go up a few sizes.
4.0,It's Fits but you can get 1 size larger.
4.0,"Great bra. The edges of the cups are already turning outward, which makes it more visible under a smooth shirt. Otherwise, great quality and padding."
4.0,I like the adjustable ear straps and nose clips. I’m able to wear these while doing physical work and my eyeglasses don't usually fog up.
4.0,This is very much like my old wallet that finally was worn out. It fits comfortably in my jeans back or side pockets. So far there is nothing about it that I don't like.
4.0,"You get what you pay for in terms of fabric, but it is a great &#34;blanket&#34; for a cold office!"
4.0,"Love it, but shrunk :)"
4.0,Stud is not located in the middle of this earring
4.0,very good quality..however I needed to wash them a few times..the material (nylon) did give &#34;thong&#34; burn the first few times until they were wash a couple times..very uncomfortable
4.0,Love theses shirts
4.0,"Husband had rotator cuff surgery. He usually wears a 2xl, this shirt was a little snug but very soft and it did the job for him.<br />finding a shirt to work post surgery and Having a sling strapped to your side was a challenge. This shirt was wonderful."
4.0,"The things I like about this product are ONE that it is super sexy, and TWO that the material is super soft! You never know with lace what you're going to get, and for the price I wasn't sure what to expect, I am happy to say that it definitely met my expectations, I was also a little concerned about how it was going to fit me, I'm a size 0 and wear a 32D so I was hoping to not be too disappointed, while it was a little lose on the bottom it was huge or falling off of me. The top, I did have a little bit of trouble keeping my boobs in, but honestly once you are ready to get down to business I don't think that matters anymore. My husband loved it, and so did it!! Item is as described and looks exactly like the pictures.<br /><br />Overall super pleased with this product, hope that in the future they will be able to sell them in other size options other than one size fits all, but like I said, it didn't look like I was swimming in it or anything. I used, threw it in the washer and didn't experience any problems. I have bought one like it from Victoria's Secret for 5 times more the price of this one and I can honestly say they're very comparable. Recommend this to anyone looking for something to spice things up without having to spend lots of money!<br /><br />I received this item for free or at a discount to evaluate then share my honest &amp; unbiased review. The above statements are purely my own opinions"
4.0,Nice. Fits well. Comfy.
4.0,"good material, very stylish, 4 stars because of the measurement, very  small top and sleeves."
4.0,Comfortable to wear and pretty colors
4.0,"Not a lot of stretch to the fabric, so I feel a little restricted. Other than that it’s fine!"
4.0,"listen this is not the l-lemon that I also have, but it is almost as good, and about 1/4 the price<br />the other brand:<br />the l-lemon is cut ever so slightly more flatteringly, and somehow the way the fabric runs makes the legging more flattering. and they have reflective stuff at bottom. unfortunately I got a small in those and they actually fall down after some time.<br /><br />these: still hold everything in perfectly fine, are not see through, and are about the same sizing--I got a extra small in these and they stay up much better than the small in l-lemons<br /><br />I would usually wear a small or even medium in most clothes but I get an extra small in leggings so I feel more held in."
4.0,"These shoes look amazing, like they cost WAY more than they do. I ordered my normal size and I have kind of weird feet, so I probably should have ordered a half size larger. They’re not made for comfort, so don’t expect to feel like you’re walkin’ on clouds or anything but dang, are they CUTE, well-made, and exactly what i wanted."
4.0,Only 4 stars because despite washing them by hand and hanging them to dry the fabric still pills.  I love the cut though.  It is very flattering.
4.0,"They are just too cool. Sometimes a bit difficult to close the clasp, but I  love them anyway."
4.0,This is perfect for business casual at an office.
4.0,"I really like this. The fabric is nice and it's super cute. However, I don't expect the white fuzzy application on the tummy to last through more than just a few washings."
4.0,Purchased this snowsuit for my grandson...my daughter loves the fit and the thickness of it!
4.0,"I am 5'4 and 130lbs, normally a size small. I ordered the large and it fits me like it does on the model...so definitely order a couple sizes up. Other than that, it's a nice shirt and decent quality."
4.0,"This is a very pretty summer/casual dress that my wife loves. She really likes the flared bottom which is nice and thick and most importantly non see through while the upper area is cotton and very soft and comfy<br /><br />DESIGN/WEARING IT<br />- It features a two-tone fabric with the upper part in very soft and comfortable cotton and the lower skirt portion below the waist in a thicker satin like texture with non see through backing<br />- The length of this dress hit above the knees.. so depending on your preference it goes equally well with tights or as a standalone dress as well<br />- The skirt has a very nice floral pattern with a large flare and is most importantly non see through<br /><br />SIZING<br /><br />My wife is is 5' 7"" , weighs about 145 lbs and usually wears Medium size and this ones 'M' size fit her pretty well, besides the overall length just above the knees . Following are the measurements for sizing :<br />SIZE : MEDIUM<br />Length: 36""<br />Bottom Flare : 37""<br />Chest : 16.5""<br />Sleeves : 23""<br /><br />Overall this is a very pretty dress with an attractive design and floral pattern. It goes equally well with a waist belt and even with or without tights/pants. Just keep in mind that the length is above knees."
4.0,gift to daughter she loves them
4.0,Fortunately I read the comments saying to go up a size because had I went with the size I normally wear it would have been way too small. I went up a size and it fits perfectly.
4.0,It’s rougher material not soft but as pictured. Very cute for beach
4.0,A little too thin to wear without a cami underneath.
4.0,"Really long, world perfectly."
4.0,fits very good.  but I feel its a little bit expensive.<br />Maybe $20 price would be ok.
4.0,"Very cute shors, granddaughter loved them"
4.0,"These socks are a little thinner than Bombas, but they fit well. I like the color assortment and the price is excellent."
4.0,It's a really nice handbag .but smaller than I expected to be
4.0,I normally wear a medium and ordered a medium. It is a bit tight around the arms.<br />Super cute though!
4.0,Nice bathing suit....a little small on the bust for bustier women.
4.0,Love the material and it fit excellent.
4.0,"If you are going to use these on gravel bars or any other place like that you will occasionally get poked and stabbed in the bottom of your foot with these, am on my third season with these and have been shopping around for something else just because of that, it's the big slits they put in the bottom (mostly heel) that allow rocks to slide up and get you, there has been a couple times I had to take it off and check for blood (none).... but now that I said all that I have to say, they are a great shoe, the bottoms in general give some sturdy padding with a harder rubber, although I would like even more, also, the rubber feeds up around the sides a little and up the back. Had to get use to the toe thing, but didn't take long and now I prefer the toeing, more grip. Velcro straps, too, are good for getting a more custom fit.<br /><br />The price is ridiculous, got my first pair at JCs Penny for 35 (no longer carry)and fix the large entryway for rocks in the bottom, get rid of the netting around the toes (weak) and lower the price.<br /><br />By the way, no downright injuries from rocks in the bottom, but it sometimes feels like there is and that is from walking on gravel bars and river with a constant rocky bottom."
4.0,"Beautiful color and soft fabric.  Not see through.  Fabric does ""give"" a little but does show every bulge if you have them."
4.0,worked really well with the palazzo pants
4.0,Made a nice look but kept kinking up
4.0,"Husband uses these to slip on his fancy work shoes. Rather than crunch down the back of the shoes, by stepping into them, this shoehorn set slides his heel in easy and effortlessly. The rubber grips at the top keep it from slipping from your hand and the little hole at the end makes it easy to hang this up when it's not in use. Husband enjoys his new shoe horns!"
4.0,"To confirm, this jacket is NOT Orolay brand.. It is actually by a brand called &#34;Joslan&#34;. I found out this jacket is also sold on Korean websites for about $60-$70.. To know if this jacket was worth ~$80, I will test it out when I go up North and I will edit when I get back. First, I ordered a small, which was tailored nicely to my build, but the back and sleeve length was too small, so I returned and ordered a medium. As I will still be keeping the medium (because it's so darn cute and cozy!!), I have to say the sleeve length is still shorter for me, and the back is still slightly snug. Regardless, I am willing to work with it. Keep in mind, this jacket's style is meant to look more loose, and it is long; I am 5' 9'' and the bottom of the jacket hits around my upper-mid thigh. P.S. The color is on point, too.<br /><br />Edit:  This jacket DID the job up in the Chicago Winter cold... Did a wonderful job against winds and freezing temperatures. I would recommend this to a friend."
4.0,The ears were a big hit!
4.0,"I first bought XL as I have a 36"" waist. They fit like a tent so I went down to a medium. I'm definitely not a medium but these fit great now!"
4.0,Hat is nicely made. poorly packaged.. in a soft bag..one side of the brim is curved up.. letting it sit to see if it flattens out. Found the hat to be on the large side. the inner headliner is not elastic. The leather hatband is nice and though it has holes like a belt.. the distance from the end to the first small adjustment is longer than the other holes. in my case goes from too loose to too tight! Not sure how adjustable this is.. will probably just punch a new hole. Would say 'buy it and try it'. May fit you better.
4.0,Went a size up and fits great!
4.0,"A little big,  She will fit them in a couple of months"
4.0,"No longer must people wonder &#34;is this a sane, rational person?&#34; now, with your mismatching argyle socks, you can remove their peasantry doubts! An excellent choice when attending:<br /><br /> - funerals<br /> - fancy dinner parties<br /> - jet ski tournaments<br /><br />Be warned though, they're snug enough to double as medical-grade compression socks."
4.0,"Not what I was expecting.  Cute and fit well (maybe a little big, I am an XS) but it is see through."
4.0,I guess I didn’t measure my wrist correctly because it is a little too big but it is kinda hard to get over my hand so I’m not sure if if smaller would work either.
4.0,"Very pretty dress with nice fabric and design.  I like how it wraps around the waist so even though the dress is big, it drapes very nicely. Only thing is there were a lot of loose threads on the dress and the seam behind the arm ripped within two wears so construction wise it is not the best.  For the price, I do recommend though."
4.0,The pouch is beautiful but I think it is over priced.
4.0,"Very little support for large-chests, but so comfortable! Not really suitable for working out in, but as far as sleeping bras they're the best I've ever had."
4.0,"I generally wear a medium in women's shirts (small in men's/unisex), and based on other reviews, I ordered this in an XL. This turned out to be the right choice--it fits great! It's a little loose--similar to how it fits the model, so I could have probably gotten away with a large if I had wanted it to be very fitted. I haven't washed it yet, it may shrink (Note that the instructions say to air dry--but I'll probably forget and put it in the dryer anyway, I'll let you know how that goes!).<br /><br />It's not the most high-quality material, but seems to be well-constructed and the fabric is thick enough to be opaque. It's a very affordable alternative to a similar t-shirt I saw at Gap. I'd recommend it so long as ordering a size or two larger than what you usually wear is an option."
4.0,"This dress fits well and looks nice, however, I bought it since the style is breastfeeding-friendly and the fabric isn't what I expected.  The fabric is somewhat &#34;shiny&#34; so I imagine that stains wouldn't come off of it very easily.  I'll be sending it back, but I'd recommend it as a nice, well-fitting dress for the price."
4.0,Would like to see a belt with trout or tarpon
4.0,"Cute sandals for girls, some craftmanship to be improved"
4.0,"My husband ordered a large hat for me, but next time I'll order a medium.  Other than the sizing, this hat worked out well for our recent trip visiting National Parks in Utah.  My husband really loves his lighter-colored hat and even wears it while working outside in our yard.  Thanks!"
4.0,Just as expected except maybe a little bluer than the picture indicates.
4.0,I ordered an extra large as I usually do thanks to my larger chest. These felt slightly tight around my stomach but the opening was massive at the top - i.e. it fell down past my bra line. I still really like them and will wear them but the fit was sorta weird. They're extremely comfortable though and great breathable fabric.
4.0,"I was quite surprised when I received my dress in the mail.  The material is much thicker than I expected it to be and the yellow/mustard color pretty much matches the picture as shown.  I will say, however, that the material wrinkles quite easily.  So if you don't mind ironing, then you've hit a gem!  I'm 5'6&#34; at 140 pounds and the medium fits quite comfortably and hits slightly below my knees.  This dress would look good with a petticoat, but I wore mine without one and it still looks great."
4.0,My wife likes them.........
4.0,"beautiful, but hurt after a while"
4.0,Shipping is long
4.0,was kina small yet i still like it
4.0,These do run big but are very cute and comfortable.  I have two pairs and wear them a lot.
4.0,Cute! Looks like picture but they run narrow around the calf muscles. If you have big calf muscle I wouldn't buy.
4.0,Much more comfortable than terry but wish the pockets were larger
4.0,"The coat meets its description, but runs on the small side.  I'm 5'5"", 120 lbs., so I ordered a medium which should have fit just right. It will be ok, however I would have been happier if the coat was a bit roomier."
4.0,"I was hoping these would be a little thicker than they were, but nonetheless they’re comfortable and great for working out. The material is very stretchy and conforms to the body. All in all, a great buy for the price."
4.0,These are very comfortable and feel very well made... Very pleased
4.0,"Love the style, but size is too large!"
4.0,"I normally wear a 2XL in Amazon dresses, but this one had a tight fit. It's a nice dress if you can find your size."
4.0,"This scarf and hat set is so cute. They aren’t super thick, so maybe fall like weather or when it’s just getting cold. They probably wouldn’t keep you too warm in really cold temperatures. But they do make a cute accessory! The stitching isn’t perfect, but it seems that it will hold."
4.0,"This a very soft pretty yoga work out type top. I am by no means big (36B- 29 waist-38 Hips middle age body)but the first time I ordered a large and it was super super tight, I re-ordered a xxl and it fits just right ( I like my tops with breathing room)"
4.0,"very nice dress.  I read alot of the reviews and ordered a size up: mistake.  i'm 5'2, size 11 and the xl was way too big.  Sent back, and ordered a medium, as the dress runs a little long for my short legs.  better luck next time?  time will tell."
4.0,"At first I was very skeptical about getting these gauges because I'd seen mix reviews about not getting the same size. Thankfully all of the gauges were 6g like I needed.<br />However,<br />The indentions at the end of the gauges, (to prevent rings from coming off) we're not deep enough. My husband has now lost to rings. I know it's partially him tossing and turning in his sleep, ontop of them not being secured by the indentions. Just a fair warning, when you get these to just push them all the way back instead of just relying on the indention. Very good product, gemstones are gorgeous, and I would by again."
4.0,"Beautiful dress, nice color, soft fabric."
4.0,"Fit was a little off for me but could just be my body type! I’m used to buying stretchy jeans, they have no stretch and we’re a little big on my hips and lower stomach while a little tight on my thighs. BUTTTT I loved them and got so many compliments 😃"
4.0,Cute! Fabric isn’t what I was expecting though but still cute
4.0,Pretty shoe. Great quality. My only complaint is that I bought the shoe because the photo showed a strap. Larger girl sizes have no strap.
4.0,"Love the sparkle very pretty colors, really comfortable top not itchy. I am 5ft 8in, 163 chest is 38/40C, It was still a little too big around my chest even after tightening up the straps. I wore it under a blazer and looked so amazing."
4.0,Overall it is pretty cute and definitely a good casual dress! It's perfect for if you are going to a small party with family or even a job interview. I am 5'6 and weigh 125 so I kind of thought that the dress was a bit baggy on me but overall it fit well and the material was nice.
4.0,"Bigger than I thought they were going to be, but I really like thim"
4.0,Stem could be taller I cant wear the top ball
4.0,"Come big, order two sizes below of what you really are otherwise it is good material"
4.0,The color of this is perfect! the drape is really nice as well. Only complaint is the pockets. I wish they were fastened down because they often turn inside out and hang outside (looks a little silly).
4.0,"Very comfortable, practical, and great for biking and long outdoor walks in moderately cool temperatures. The only drawback is the yarn contains no wool, rendering it useless when the temperature drops below 40."
4.0,Its a little larger than expected but i don’t feel it when i wear it.
4.0,"I do love this shirt however, it does not fit as I would like. I got my size and it fits great except the length! Other than that, great shirt!"
4.0,These leggings for me so well. The quality is amazing to come from Amazon. I had ordered some spanx leggings and I sent them back once I received these. The stretch is really good. I had a baby recently and they held my tummy in so well.
4.0,I like the stretchy material (especially since it was slightly small). Style and color true to pictures.
4.0,8.5 is way too wide where 8 is a bit short but fits well. Sizing runs differently. I wear a 7.5/8 normally
4.0,"Top is snug and shorts a bit large. But, beautiful colors and very soft material."
4.0,They feel fake but it’s okay
4.0,Very nice quality. Nice size. Lovely gift box. Worth every penny.
4.0,Laces fit as expected.
4.0,must be very grizzly looking to make this not look feminine
4.0,"The racer-back dress looks pretty good on my wife and she says it is exceptionally comfortable. There are two reasons that I didn't give it 5 stars.<br /><br />First while this is almost entirely cotton it says you can't put it in the dryer. I hate that so many clothes go out of their way to not be dryer safe.<br /><br />Second it is a little big. The small swims a little on my 100lb wife and doesn't show her form quite like she expected.<br /><br />Still, comfortable, cute, and stylish."
4.0,"I got this so that I can slip it on over t-shirts, jackets, etc. I can say that it does just that and I use it over whatever I am wearing in order to gain additional safety when using roads to get somewhere. The sizing does run a little small however so get the next size up from what you would normally order."
4.0,Really love the fabric! A wrinkle resistant chiffon. I'm a 2xand it for just right.would b gr8witha pair of jeans! Cute top..havnt washed yet..we will see how that goes...
4.0,"I love the wallet so much since Tokyo Ghoul is my favorite anime. Everything is perfect but in my opinion the wallet is a bit too big, I would love it if it were smaller. Aside from all that it's a great wallet"
4.0,I love the length and contrasting fresh colors.
4.0,Love the retro look and buttons. Runs on the smaller fitted side.
4.0,"Nicely made, a good tight milled sticht, very cute. I had of<br />gotten the knee high and liked them so much, I bought these ankle lengths. Wash them lot of the package , slight machine oder. I have 71\2 shoes size, these are a little sung but I think ok for up to about a size 8"
4.0,"I usually buy a large but read a review to size down so I did and got medium. definitely the right thing to do. The bust is a bit large and bending over you could really fall out of this. I don't like the belt or belt loops on this I ended up putting the tie in the back because it loosens up easily and looks sloppy. Super short at the front as you can see, but it's not too short. It's very thin but a nice soft material. It will be nice in the hot summer."
4.0,These are a classic pair of glasses. I like them. They look vintage.
4.0,"This wallet comes in various colors, I am received the black one.<br /><br />You can place your Driver’s License or ID card in the clear front pocket which has an oval cutout to facilitate removal when needed. On the back are three pockets for easy access to various cards. The middle pocket can hold additional cards or money. Not a whole thick wad but definitely a few bucks, no coins.<br /><br />Wasn’t sure how to test its RFID protection, so I’ll take their word it but I would say to have that protection you should put your cards in upside so that they are “in” the wallet."
4.0,I got this for my mom for a Mother's Day gift and she loved it.
4.0,It fits and works well.
4.0,"Excellent quality. I like the weight (sturdy, not too bulky or cheap and flimsy) and the lens size and color.<br />I only gave 4 stars because the arm length was too short to go over my ears. But they made a great gift for a friend who loves them dearly.<br />Anyone considering a purchase of any brand of sunglasses should measure the arm length of a pair that fits you well, then compare measurements on Amazon. If the seller doesn't list dimensions of their product it's not worth buying."
4.0,I love the size of all the earrings in the collection. It came housed in a little black bag and separated by small plastic bags (I appreciate the sanitary extra steps). I love the size of the earrings they are more discreet and aren't too in your face when you're wearing them. The variety of earrings that come in this set is perfect for anyone who likes to switch around and have choices. With a combination of rounded and square style earrings. Each of the earrings come with the earring itself and a back that holds them in place.
4.0,"My granddaughter loves this, but she's not yet 3 and a little rough."
4.0,"I would like to thank you for a great shirt! It was a gift for my mom and she loves it! She loved the color and the fit. it wasn't to heavy or too lite! Her apartment gets cold in the winter, even with the heat on. As far as she is concerned, she wants more!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4.0,"I am 135lb 5'5&#34; this gown fits loosely, very comfortable, the fabric is very soft, perfect length. it is extremely see through, no biggy for sleeping in but, not for wearing around the house. The straps just have small plastic rings for adjusting. Not super quality, sort of looks like a halloween costume. All in all very comfortable but, not stylish or sexy."
4.0,"Their good. Not wow your pants off, And a little smaller than I expected, But I like them better for it. Hard to sleep in, But I guess all earings are like that. All in all, Good."
4.0,deff at least 1-2 sizes smaller than listed. my wife wears med and had to return the med and get her an XL for it to fit. other than that it looks nice on it is very thin so this is more of a outfit addition rather than an outer layer for warmth. cool idea and looks cooler on. you can wear different color shirts underneath for different effects or just show bare skin in the back but that may not be feasible to wear in public that way lol.<br /><br />Anyway nothing special about the shirt except the skull which is why i bought it anyway so no complaints here
4.0,Nice & classy!
4.0,"This case is large and of great quality. The bottles did not leak. I would’ve given it 5 stars, but the lens case did leak. It’s an oddball shape, but fortunately I had one spare lens case that fit in the compartment perfectly."
4.0,I like this ring I love the feathers going down the sides. What I don’t like is the plastic fake turquoise.
4.0,The jacket is nice. The blue is more of a dark navy color as opposed to the blue in the picture. The flowers look good. Overall the jacket looks good but once you’re wearing it the fabric choices make it feel a little on the cheap side. Not bad for the price point though.
4.0,"Great, belt. Been using it for work about a month and I'm always moving on the job. Holding up well."
4.0,I get many compliments on this product. I bought it as a wallet but find I can get by with using it alone if necessary.
4.0,Bought this as a gift; my Mother really loved it.
4.0,"These are absolutely adoreable!! They came exactly as pictured and are true to size. My 4 year old loves them, they are her new favorite shoes to wear. The heel is small enough I don't worry about her tripping and yet she gets fancy boots and heels like Mama. Definitely cute ankle booties!  I'd recommend for sure."
4.0,"Just received my jacket, but it runs smaller than thought . I'm 6ft 225 and this is a ""slim fit"" .I would recommend getting an xxl if your about my size . Quality seems good and is comfortable even though it's small.  Love that it has the arm pit zippers so you can let some fresh air in if you get uncomfortable!!"
4.0,Nice n light
4.0,So cute. Did shrink a lot when washed
4.0,Very pretty stone...I like the stone better than the silver edging. Good price.
4.0,"It's pretty, but doesn't fit my body. It's too short for my torso and doesn't come up high enough. You have to string the lace yourself. Otherwise seems like a nice product."
4.0,"Dress is beautiful quality but runs small. Out of 6 dresses that I ordered in the same size on Amazon this is the only one that didn't fit. Dress comes quite a bit above the knee for me but I'm 5'7"""
4.0,I wear xl but so I Bought XL. But when it’s arrived I saw XL WAS A BAD IDEA SO I CHANGES FOR A L.
4.0,"Not sure how effective it is, but it has a good idea behind it."
4.0,Too big and wrong color.
4.0,"For it's price point, this is an excellent garment of clothing; loud and expressive colors, with a bold pattern print. I am 6'5'', broad shoulders, long arm with a waist line of 33 (207lbs). My personal style calls for a slim fit. I ordered a large and it fits great."
4.0,sleeves were short but nice
4.0,Pretty good sunglasses and very comfortable.  But not that fancy metal frames that you can find in top brand products.
4.0,The quality of this charm is very good and it is a unique piece.
4.0,"Perfect little wallet, holds all I need.  It's attractive and feels sturdy and durable,  I am pleased so far."
4.0,"Beautiful, don't expect a significantly shorter bar than normal, only slightly noticeable. Good quality metal for those who are sensitive like myself."
4.0,"They look great, but they are too small for my nose, and that's my own fault for not realizing it when I ordered them."
4.0,I like pendant in my neck
4.0,"Cute top, nice fabric, will be great for summer beach ware."
4.0,It's just like my old one that I originally got in Italy. But this replacement is much more heavier.  But it does the job.
4.0,Nice inexpensive dress that can be dressed up with a scarf. Fits well. But would look better on a taller thinner person.
4.0,"Great Briar rose costume sans the maiden hat :)<br />Good quality, I washed it and steamed the wrinkles out of it and it worked for 2 performances!"
4.0,Feels great but almost too much material and too short to belt up.
4.0,Wears well and washes well
4.0,Beautiful pic doesn't do justice runs a little bit small worth money
4.0,"Thick, high-quality band. Does not include springbars, which is typical of this band style. Have bought these from multiple companies and this model is higher quality than most. Do note that the design of the band (and its thickness) will cause the watch to sit higher on your wrist than normal. This is noteworthy when throwing on a thick case.<br /><br />One downside: I ordered the 20mm and it does not fit my 20mm lug width Seiko diver. Had to return. Unsure if a packaging error or what. I've used other 20mm zulu bands with it, no problem.<br /><br />Other than that, excellent band."
4.0,"It's a decent pair of gloves. If you are looking for some thick gloves for you or your kids to use when it snows or ice, I wouldn't recommend these."
4.0,Sounds really good I wear this St work where you're not allowed to have headphones. Perfect for stealth listening. It was a little small at first for my big head but it's broken in fairly well the battery will last me a whole shift. Recommended.
4.0,"I love this item, with two caveats. First, it does run small - specifically, it runs small in the sleeves. I like my sweater sleeves long enough to fall over my hands a bit, and these don't reach my wrists. I believed the reviews that said it runs small but figured I wanted something a little more snug, and I am very happy with the fit, but I would have gone a size up if I'd realized the sleeves would be so short. Second, the material is very thin, which could be a pro or a con. I purchased the cardigan to keep at the office as an extra warmth layer, and it's not as effective at that as I would have hoped - but it would be great to add some flow and grace to an outfit on a summer evening, or to use as a layer to make an outfit more conservative. It's very cute and I'm very pleased overall. I might buy another one - just one size bigger!"
4.0,"My 6 yr old daughter loves the color and the design. But the size ""M"" seems run short. It looks more like a blouse than a dress on my kid. The fabric is thin and soft which is perfect for summer hot weather. The color fades a little bit after two washes, it may not be able to last for more than one season."
4.0,"The set I received had a light pink instead of the violet, and the orange is much darker than the lovely light topaz shown. I do see now that the product description includes 11 colors and &#34;etc.&#34; but it's not clear that you will receive 10 random colors which may or may not be the ones pictured.<br />I had the same problem others did with the tops not coming off - the clear, light pink, and dark blue. Overall they look nice and are a reasonable quality for the price - cheaper than buying individually - but I bought this set mostly for the clear and clear iridescent ones, and I can't use the clear one, so that's disappointing."
4.0,Got it for sister on her bday and she loved.
4.0,"Took one star away because it seems a bit small contradictory to the size chart, but otherwise, very impressed with the quality for the price."
4.0,A little to tight for my liking. Hope I can exchange it for a larger size. It’s really cute and love the zipper so it’s not close to neck.
4.0,"These are fashionable gloves.  They are soft, both inside and out.  I have only worn them once, in 60 degree weather, so I cannot speak to how warm they are in very cold weather.  The touch screen feature did not work for me."
4.0,"This is comfy and great for walking/jogging in cooler weather. The wool is wicking and warm, but still breathable just like you would expect. The hood is deep enough to cover and stay on your head.<br /><br />I'm short (5'0"") and find that the small nicely covers my rear. It rides up a bit when jogging, but no where near enough to leave a gap between top and pants. Even long torsoed people should be covered.<br /><br />I do wish that the pockets were deeper. They are sufficient for tucking hands into, but anything you put in there runs a high risk of falling out. I also wish it came in more colors. I'm pretty tired of quality women's athletic wool coming in grey, dark grey, black, and maybe navy of they get wild. The men get a wider variety of both types of clothing and colors in the Woolys brand. I would give them more of my $$ of I could get things in actual colors."
4.0,"I didn’t get the sash, to tie around. Everything thing else was cool"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:83b4c57d7bacba3a559f5379d194e6a4]] They’re cute, but the material is ehh"
4.0,"Two layer jacket it great, but would be better with a way to connect the two at the end of the sleeves- every time the jacket is removed the inside layer sleeves turn inside out. Other than that, it fits right, it's warm, and the colors are vibrant and fun!"
4.0,It has held up on my 10yr old well. No discolor. Seems durable
4.0,"Super cute! They fit perfectly , they're cute and stylish"
4.0,Super cute. Decent quality for the price. Very slightly larger than expected. I wear between 6 and 7 ordered a 6.5 and they are just a smidgen bigger than I anticipated. Totally wearable but would probably have chosen a 6 if I were trying them on in the store.
4.0,"I like this romper a lot. I bought it for the style and when it came in it was just what I have been looking for. My only problem is that it's a bit too tight in the booty area and the material is a little bit itchy. But other than that, it makes a cute and comfy outfit."
4.0,The earring are cute. Great quality just disappointed in the actual color. The color is not the same as pictured. It’s more of a peach color or pastel/light orange.
4.0,Thinner material than I’d hoped. Runs small. Returned.
4.0,"Really cute, doesn’t look cheap. It’s a little long on me but I’m 5’4” and was going for a more rock and roll look. It probably looks/feels appropriate on a longer human. Zippering something diagonally kind of blows my mind but it’s fun."
4.0,Used as a gift and my friend loved it
4.0,"It's a cute suit. I said somewhat small because the bottoms are actually somewhat short going up the torso. My daughter is in 2T right now and I got the small, super cute but it doesn't sit high like the picture."
4.0,"Love it, but a Little snug  in the chest area, all kinds of room past that!!"
4.0,Really cute. Good quality and style. But a little small in the bust.
4.0,"I took these flip flop with me to Maui!! Love them, very comfortable!"
4.0,"These bags are lovely and are well suited for the intended purpose. They are not too big nor too small, thus allowing you to carry a few small necessary things like your cell phone, keys etc. The material is great as well. I give it a 4 rating because I haven't started using them having bought the red, gold & black and so am leaving room for disappointment when I start to use them."
4.0,fits my money just fine!! lanyard is a bit short though
4.0,I bought the 50th bracelet. Looks like the picture. Only thing was is that it didn’t come in a box but did come with a little blue bag.
4.0,Very happy with the shoes. She wears them every day. Very good chance we will order from you again someday.
4.0,I wear a size 12 and the large fit perfectly.
4.0,"Fits well, if somewhat small. Good construction and design. Would definitely purchase again."
4.0,Looks like good quality bought as a gift
4.0,Good value for the money. My knees got damp through the material with my knees bent and the fabric pulled tight. No problems as yet with zippers or flaws. You can fold them down to fit in their bag without difficulty.
4.0,I am 5’1 and 170. Thankfully this dress was not to long. It fit great! The problem is it’s SEE-THROUGH!! I could totally see my  panties!!
4.0,"Sunglasses run a bit small, but are nice for the price."
4.0,Very cute shirt . Love the style and look. I would size up as they run small.
4.0,"The top was a little too small, the bottoms fit great."
4.0,My daughter loved it as her gift for her graduation present.
4.0,Nice for the price.  Very comfortable and easily adjusted for size. I am very happy with the ring I have purchased.
4.0,"They are adorable but NOT blue.  They are white.  Too much trouble to return.  I would have given 5 stars if they were the correct color.  VERY nice box,  extra backs and a tiny cleaning cloth.  Really well made for the price.  If only they were BLUE!!!!!"
4.0,Soft comfortable socks.
4.0,Fits good. Looks good without being heavy.
4.0,Very pretty. Used as a bathing suit cover.
4.0,Very comfortable<br />Easy to get on and off<br />Good looks
4.0,Purchased as a gift. They look very soft and comfy.
4.0,"I bought these in three colors. They are comfortable and true to size. I would say, they are not great for hotter weather as they are thicker than regular athletic material."
4.0,It is so small it is hard to read the I love yous when light shines thru it.  We initially lost one of the small pieces too
4.0,So I love this bra.  The longline is my new favorite style and Freya has such cute designs.  I will note that is does tend to flare out at the bottom..but it did accidentally get thrown into the dryer? So maybe that's why.  I have another brand that was with it and that isn't happening.
4.0,I liked the cooling features and the can use as a face mask when required.<br />Loved the designs!
4.0,Description was very accurate.  Quality of sweater is very good.
4.0,A lot silkier than I thought and bought a size bigger for flow but doesn’t look right. Comfortable just not what I was looking for.
4.0,I get compliments every time I wear it and people can't believe I got it off Amazon. Just be aware the material is somewhat thin so wear appropriate undergarments. Otherwise it is well-fitted on me (I'm pretty petite though) even despite my height (5') and the material is great for summer and warm fall.
4.0,I was looking for a dress I could wear anywhere.  It can be dressed up or kept basic.  I like the fabric as well. I would buy another when needed.
4.0,Go up a size it runs on the smaller end
4.0,Love the earnings just took forever to receive!
4.0,"Not strong enough in the waist for gym work, but are good for all day use when dressed for casual living"
4.0,These bracelets are ok. Cute but the plating was flaking a bit when I got them.
4.0,"Mido 5.2 ft y peso 133 lb, pedi talla M y me queda muy bien. Regularmente soy talla M asi que las tallas coinciden.<br />La tela no es muy delgada ni muy gruesa, se ajusta perfecto aunque creo que la version 1.0 de estos leggins son mejores en cuanto a realce de gluteos.<br />Si transparenta pero lo normal para las telas elasticas, yo lo recomiendo para sentadilla siempre y cuando uses un boxer debajo o una licra para evitar que se te vea la piel en la bajada de la sentadilla, la compresion en el abdomen es adecuada, si se marca la ropa interior y marca un poco la entrepierna.<br />La costura delgada que tiene en el area de los gluteos me encanta por que te da forma muy bonita, siempre compro con esta costura por que no arruga como otros.<br />Probablemente solo sea este modelo ya que es un poco diferente a los demas, tengo el azul claro y ese me va perfecto, no transparenta ni marca nada, en definitiva compraria mas en esta tienda."
4.0,This is a one size piece. It will be cute with the sleeves pushed up. It's a tad short in front for my taste and I'm not sure how much it will shrink after it is washed. For reference I am 5'6&quot; 133lbs with a 33&quot; inseam so I am a bit short waisted.
4.0,"First, this tote is very cute and appears to be very well made. Rather than canvas, the material is more of a shiny thick polyester. Zippers are thick and all work smoothly. It can be carried on the forearm or in hand by the attached handles or you can use it as a shoulder bag with the shoulder strap. It has three outside pockets (2 in front and one in the back) and two internal pockets (one with a zipper). The main pouch. also zips shut for security so it would work well as a purse or personal item on trips.<br /><br />That being said, I bought this bag because the description said ""he laptop backpack is made of cushy and sturdy polyester fabric with metal zippers, which is quite durable."" It is very small for a computer bag. I have a 13 in Macbook and it maxes this thing out if places in the bag horizontally, making. the other pockets obsolete because you can no longer stuff them. If placed vertically, the computer sticks out about 3 inches. The photos show a large tote shoulder bag but this is more of a purse. Much smaller than the photos market.<br /><br />For $10, you cant beat this quality and it's very cute. I highly recommend as a purse/tote, tablet bag or personal item on flights. However, I cannot recommend for its intended purpose as a computer bag."
4.0,"Great fit and well made dress for the price.  Is my go-to spring dress, dressy enough for casual dining and casual enough for running around town"
4.0,These are nice and stretchy. The ribbed texture looks good. They are rather thin and would be better for layering.
4.0,Mom loves it. She retired her old setup. However the buttons are brittle and will pop off easily. She can sew so 4 stars but that doesn't mean others will feel this way in a review
4.0,little lose
4.0,"We really like the ombre look and how the sparkles are flat and not raised. If you are used to leos with rhinestones, this is not as brilliant under the gym lights, but it is very nicely made and comfortable."
4.0,Great jewelry love them
4.0,"This is a nice-looking top for the price, but order one size up.  I did after reading some of the reviews and I'm glad I did."
4.0,"Looks good.<br />But clip has several trouble.<br />Clip injures clothes.<br />Sometimes it is hard to release from cloths.<br />Even this tightness, it was removed spontaneously according to cloths.<br />When you use it, fix it and don't move."
4.0,These were super nice for my baby to have at the lake!!! They are a little snug but she was comfortable
4.0,The necklace is very nice and well made.  Wasn't sure about clasp but was able to put it on without help no problem.
4.0,Yellow-gold colour and look pretty. Got 2 of them
4.0,"Very cute top, but runs very small. I am 5'7"", 130 lbs. and got a size large. Should have purchased an XL."
4.0,It fit a tad small but I like it
4.0,"The color is beautiful, it fits to form, it repels water, washes nicely, wears well and - most of all - is very comfortable!"
4.0,gorgeous shoes! very sexy! I'm used to walking in heels so I'd say these are good but if you're not used to it then they'll definitely be uncomfortable or awkard because the heel is HIGH and the front support is minimal. I have a size 8 narrow foot and they fit perfectly except for a bit snug in the toe box area. I have very thin ankles as well but I was able to untie and adjust the laces for a tighter fit. I double knot them and they don't come free but be careful with them because the laces themselves are a suede-like material and can break if you pull too hard which I've learned from other pieces of clothing. These are very well made however and great quality. There's also a zipper up the heel to save time getting them on and off once you get the laces were you'd like. Very happy with the purchase for the price. :)
4.0,"These are superbly comfortable. Ended up buying 3 pair. However, I think I've realized that on all of them that I tried on, the right shoe seems to always be just slightly longer than the left one. I put them all up next to each other, and all were that way. Not very much, just slightly. Hopefully these will last a long time. They should because I'm easy on shoes. I am just hoping they don't stretch out much. Wish they came in half sizes."
4.0,Cute bow tie. it’s already tied so that’s a plus
4.0,Really a nice necklace whether you are into Shungite or not.  Its really cool!!  The sphere is nice to put in your purse where your phone may be.
4.0,"one star taken away , should have stated in ad that it was made in china"
4.0,"The Grandkids found these little lights a delight.  Made a great stocking stuffer.  Even gave my adult children and my group of friends some to use as night lights, to carry in their bags, to use in emergencies.  They put out a surprising amount of light."
4.0,"I love the aviator look of sunglasses, but didn’t want them to cover my face! I ordered these in the large size and they fit great. Just the right size. I really don’t have any complaints about them. Good value for the price- they came with a carry case, small drawstring bag and cleaning clothe."
4.0,"Seemed very nice, had to return it due to size issues, but it the packing was meh."
4.0,"This suit is VERY cute! I ordered a medium (I avg. size 6, 4-8 in some clothes)  - really liked it .... but returned it b/c of fit issues. I'm not bothering with a size-up only b/c I ordered another suit that fit better. Comments/Recs on SIZE SELECTION: The top fit okay (it's supportive, but could have used a little more height for coverage) - I mostly returned b/c the shorts were a too snug for my liking and the other suit I ordered fit. So b/c of the fit/not-fit, I'd say if you like your suits to be really tight then get the size you think you are - but if you're a 6 (and reasonably chesty/an adult woman) then I would get a large (i.e., consider sizing up). If you're a teen - though - and not that chesty,  then get the size you are."
4.0,"My old wallet was leather and probably 15+ years old.  I guess over time the wallet got a bit stretched out.  This wallet holds everything my old wallet did and looks pretty nice.  My only gripe is that the credit cards fit really snugly when you use all three slots on either side of the wallet.  I'm hoping that the wallet will stretch out over time and they'll fit a bit better.  Only time will tell.  Quality-wise, I can't complain.  The stitching is great and the wallet looks nice.  Glad I got it!"
4.0,"I agree with the other reviewer who said this is a cute dress, but won't last very long. It is cute and playful and my girlfriend felt (and looked) beautiful in it. So for the money, it really is a good value. Just don't expect it to last more than one summer."
4.0,"I love how soft it is! Only problem I had was it had snags already in it, but I was able to work with them so that it would stop coming apart."
4.0,"Was looking for a simple, shirt. We always found very elaborate shirts, brightly colored shirts, or ones with too many words .This shirt was perfect because the color is more neutral and the picture is simple. Good for boys or girls. Fits as descibed."
4.0,Nice lightweight slipper for lounging. Not much support if you're standing a lot.
4.0,"It was just a bit smaller than the size chart, but my wife loved it... Me tooooooo. It should last for a few uses as long as things don't get outa hand. ;)"
4.0,It was very long so had to get it cut down. Other than that I liked it.
4.0,"Cute dress, fit TTS. I wore to a bridal shower and a wedding a received tons of compliments"
4.0,I've only tried them on - not worn them yet.  They seem comfortable.  The waistband comes up even higher than I expected.  I'm 5'7&#34; and 170lbs.
4.0,"These things are a gigantic pain to close, in my ears I couldn’t even do it by myself, I had to have someone help me. Once in though, they’ve stayed put and I love them! I have a bit of a nickel allergy so anything that’s not the highest quality will make my ears swell and itch like crazy- not these though!! I love them, I never take them out and I’m super pleased with them!"
4.0,"I read reviews saying that you should size up, so I did...and it's a little too big, but not so much that I need to return it.  The fabric has a creped texture, which isn't my favorite, but it will work for the office.  I think I will order the royal blue as well!"
4.0,Very nice looking wraparounds that look good on men or women. They also fit over some prescription lenses. Definitely worth the money.
4.0,Decent looking shoe for the price.
4.0,The best looks nice.... But was sent the wrong size so unfortunately it can't be worn  for what I wanted it for. Will return it.
4.0,"Very pretty shoes, however the are too large. We are keeping them for spring and her feet grow a little bigger."
4.0,"I like this shirt, but its sized kinda small for a large.  Usually a large fits me perfectly or is a little big... but this one is really tight across my chest.  I would order a size up from what you usually wear."
4.0,"I like the dress, but it’s not really even close to the mostly black dress I was wanting to wear to a wedding.  What I got is way too much white to wear as a guest at a wedding.  Love the style, pockets, and material which is why it still gets 4 stars even though the people getting them ready to ship are color blind."
4.0,Comfortable short!!!
4.0,"This corset is a very beautiful one but it definitely is not for waist training. The steel bones are spiral bones and are very flexible. It runs about average as far as corset sizes go. The closure is more for looks than anything and I'm not a big fan of the tiny gap between the two side panels. I will have to sew a front panel if I want it to be able to be worn out side of the house. Also, I had to completely replace the lace, because it was way too short and ended up just looking horrible.<br /><br />***I received this at a discounted price for both my honest opinion and my unbiased opinion on this specific product. This is NOT in any way a paid review of any kind and these are my own personal opinions expressed by me and only me. ***"
4.0,"These were true-to-size.  Initially they were a bit challenging to get on, which to me meant good compression for traveling, but on the second use, they had relaxed quite a bit. I use them for every day wear and would purchase again"
4.0,I bought this for sleep wear. I initially choose XL as I like big and loose. There was a notation that for xl order medium?? I did so and it was VERY small. The pants were like an XS and the top was tight rather than loose as it was met to be. These type items usually run small and it did. Reordered XL and it is fine. The quality is mediocre but the fabric is a nice soft heavier weight cotton. Nice for the price.
4.0,"Don't pull them. Cutting semi works, carefully singeing them works better. Be careful though!"
4.0,"Excellent product, extremely well-made. It's primary attribute is its softness. This is an extremely soft fabric that mimics cashmere. My wife liked the one I ordered so much she order one for herself.  I highly recommend this scarf.<br /><br />AD2"
4.0,Very pretty just what I was looking for.
4.0,"Wider than many of the cheaper options that pinch my head, and initially appear to be of better quality product overall. Hoping the Foster Grant name; is worth the extra cost over time.<br /><br />Negatives: The vendor: 50% more expensive online than at my CostBox store; but CostBox didn't have the x1.50 there.<br />The NON-Amazon supplier; shipped an blatantly previously sold item that had been opened, used a bit, and barely taped back together, and returned.  They could not have missed that; and resold them anyway as 'NEW'. don't see any damage yet from the previous buyer; but annoying when you pay above market $$ for 'New', and get used."
4.0,"Reaching limits for my head ,(typical European) any larger head would have issues."
4.0,like color
4.0,"The earrings have the same shape as in the picture, however they are solid black and not grey on the sides like in the picture."
4.0,"Love the socks. Super cute and always get compliments but took forever to arrive, hence 4 stars...bought them for my almost 2 year old that wears size 5-6 and also for a little friend who is almost one (not sure of her shoe size). The socks fit both of them perfectly :)"
4.0,A little tight across my chest. Very comfortable and easy to care for.
4.0,"I like these, but could  use a little more padding for warmth and comfort.  A little stiff but are adjustable."
4.0,Very good. Works great.
4.0,"I like the color (I got the purple one) and the way it drapes. It's basically what I expected for the price, though I would prefer the material to be a little thicker/warmer."
4.0,Really nice.  Only reason it's getting 4 stars is they are impossible to put on your head with 1 arm.
4.0,My 10 year old son loves these socks. He has big feet but they fit just perfectly.
4.0,I actually like the fit because I'm busty and the bra pulls me up back and synches me in pretty gd
4.0,Love love love the dress. It's a little on the big side but other than that it's a good dress.
4.0,"I was a little concerned about this DUANTAI Men's Multi-Time Zone Analog LED Square Watch. This is actually the second one we ordered because the first was defective in a number of ways (top analog hands couldn't be set, digital display was partially cut off). This replacement, however, arrived quickly and without any visible defects. I had my husband try this on his wrist and test all the functions. At first, he thought the idea of a multi-time zone watch that wasn't a GMT was a bit goofy, especially if it had more than one analog dial. After having it on his wrist, he found this watch strangely appealing and definitely eye-catching. The square-shaped gold watch case, coupled with the gold-tone, textured dial gives the watch a retro look. The watch also comes in black, blue, and white color options, but my husband thought that the gold-tone dial on this one reminded him of the creamy colored dials on vintage watches. The digital LED display is a little hard to read sometimes, but wonderfully clear when the numbers are illuminated by depressing the upper left backlight pusher. My husband said that it's actually better that the digital LED is usually so subdued because it allows the analog dials to really stand out. He noted with delight that the analog hour and minute hands are lumed and have glow-in-the dark luminescent paint along their center lines. My husband said that the watch wears comfortably on the wrist, which was surprising given how wide the watch band is (28mm at the lugs, tapering down to about 24mm at the buckle). Overall, the design of this watch has really grown on my husband, who now considers it a handsome, fun, and usable timepiece, even if it is a tiny bit goofy.<br /><br />As for the issues, setting the lower right analog dial time is difficult because the lower right setting crown is between the two right side digital LED pushers. It's slightly offset, but still sandwiched in there, making turning the crown a challenge. The difficulty of reading the digital display without depressing the backlight was already covered above. Also, as mentioned earlier, this is the second watch we received after a significantly defective one was returned. In fairness to DUANTAI, this replacement came within a week and has performed perfectly. Given the very reasonable price that this eye-catching watch sells for, I would say that it's worth giving it a try."
4.0,"Fits well, good shirt"
4.0,"Update Sept 29, 2016: I find myself wearing this inexpensive watch almost every day. It is really good looking, so thin, easy to read, with quartz accuracy. I did just reduce to 4 stars because it was necessary to bend the little projection that engages the locking part of the bracelet clasp. That shouldn't be necessary. With that little fix, it is a total winner.<br /><br />Looks good like the Amazon photo. Another review was helpful in forewarning that the bracelet clasp might come loose. It did, so I bent the little steel tang a little bit more with a pair of pliers, so the clasp requires a push to snap closed as well as the need to lift the clasp to loosen the bracelet. At $20 a good price if it continues to keep time, look good, and for the bracelet to function as it should. For all watches I see reviewers complain about their watch suffering from water damage, and in all cases it's pretty clear the owners allowed water on their watches. Big mistake. Many watches claim a degree of water resistance, and that should be ignored. My watchmaker told me, &#34;I am not a fan of getting watches wet.&#34;"
4.0,This fits great and my Stepsister love it so much she wore it to a party. And it looked great on her as a dress. I thought the fabric was more cotton but it wasn't.
4.0,The magnesium rod is a little hard to spark off the bracelet
4.0,"Wanted a nice summer shoe I could wear without socks.  This works although it is a little heavy for a summer shoe.  Nice fit, color doesn't really go with anything I own but it is very comfortable and that's more important to my feet."
4.0,Great earing but may need a backing so you don't loose it.
4.0,Easy to use.  Convenient.
4.0,"I couldn't even begin to describe good things about these jacket.<br />Everything as described or better, excellent material, wouldn't get wet even if trying.<br />enough vents to ride in hot weather and still feel safe.<br />I believe velcro will wear off eventually, I hope it never does, my favorite jacket, use it every day to ride, and every night, it could use more reflective lines.<br />Very recommended and I could even pay more!"
4.0,Needed a new holder for my cards and license. Like everything about this except that there is no magnet or snap to hold flap closed.
4.0,wears nicely
4.0,They were tiny bit too big but my daughter is so in love with them that it doesn't matter.
4.0,Really cute tank.  Looks just like the picture and is super comfy
4.0,"The date/time clasp is jammed and hard to move. It could be more smoother. However, looks premium."
4.0,"I got the Navy. Super cute... more so purple, just like pictured. Very warm and flexible l, but not totally water proof. Today, I wiped off the consensation on a playground slide for the kids, and the cold water went right throught to my finger tips. I would assume it's okay in solid snow though."
4.0,The waist fit ok but the length was way to long
4.0,"The fabric is beautiful, full and flowing, just as pictured. I plan to wear this dress for a beach wedding. It's definitely a 'one size fits most' style. The cut under the arms is slightly snug. I ordered the 35 cm length. I'm 5'7&#34;, and this length is perfect."
4.0,"5`3  -140lbs-  ordered medium- super cute and fits perfect, I love it! grest purchase!"
4.0,"First off, I received the Red and white polka dot one.  This is one of the cutest bathing suits that I have owned.  When it arrived I was excited to try it on.  I can't really pull-off the bikini anymore but I've struggled to find a one piece that was cute and flattering and didn't make me look like an old lady.  The sewing construction was perfect.  The color is very pink for what is labeled as red but that was fine by me.  One thing to be aware of is the top of the suit does not have much support.  The skirt is higher cut in the back so your backside does not have the skirt covering it. It is cut above the leg opening so it draws eyes right to the posterior.<br /><br />In spite of those two things, I really love the swimsuit!  this is an excellent product, very well made and absolutely adorable! I would most definitely recommend this item to anyone looking to purchase it, I don't believe that you would be disappointed.  I do need to inform you that I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair, unbiased review."
4.0,"Very warm and heavy. Bought as a gift, gift was very well recieved and is still currently being used (about 6 months later)."
4.0,Fit a little small. But ulrimately did not arrive in time.
4.0,It's ok. My buttons get smashed on the sides.
4.0,"I have read reviews before buying this one and ordered smaller size. Guess what? My size 60, I ordered 57 and it is just perfect fit, lol... This is why 4 stars. Quality good and acceptable. Overall I like it."
4.0,This bracelet is light weight and prefect for stacking with other bracelets
4.0,"I can see this being great for someone with smaller feet. Unfortunately, being Big Foot, these were just a bit small. They fit, but required yanking up throughout the day. I'm a women's size 9 1/2-10 and didn't find them quite my size. Good price for the quantity though!"
4.0,"Good hat, slow shipping."
4.0,fit is somewhat small for the size 10 ordered. shipment took 5 weeks as promised
4.0,"The pants are cute and comfy. The material isn't quite like I was expecting, a little stiff. They are also super long. I am 5'8&#34; and most pants are short on me, these I actually have to roll up. So if you're short keep that in mind. Otherwise, not a bad deal, but I won't buy another pair."
4.0,Nice quality for the price . A bit hard to get used to .
4.0,Very comfortable dress love it
4.0,"Haven't worn this yet,  but I love it."
4.0,"Like the light weight, these boots are not steel shanked like most and they are sized pretty small. Time will tell about the durability, but overall I am pleased for the price."
4.0,Not exactly how the picture shows straps are loose and ya gotta have boobs for this dress
4.0,"The necklace is adorable and pairs best with a strapless too or dress, you don't want to over do it. The very middle area where the beads or little balls are is kind of crooked it probably won't stay still or straight across your chest but other than that this necklace is very pretty and it is not as heavy as I thought it would be"
4.0,El aro muy grueso
4.0,"Height: 5'2, Weight: 115 pounds, Chest size: C cup, Size ordered: medium<br /><br />Pros: the jacket material is very soft on the outside. It is a heavier jacket that can be used in colder weather (i use it in 20-50 degree F temps). It is well made and has a sturdy quality to it. The pockets are quite deep for holding anything you could need in a pocket. It goes down to about my knees. It also has enough room when zipped to be able to wear a large sweater or scarf without feeling suffocated by the jacket.<br /><br />Cons: The jacket however just gives my body such a rectangular shape. The problem is, it fits perfectly on my shoulders, but is way to big everywhere else on my body. So it makes my shape look very boxy and isn't as aesthetically pleasing as the model images show. I would go down to a size small but then i would know it would be too tight on my shoulders. There is also so much material around the bottom of the jacket when zipped that it looks weird and is too baggy around my waist. If the material around the waist could be brought in a little more, then the jacket would be much more flattering to wear.<br /><br />Overall: While the jacket doesn't look as good as I hoped, it does serve its purpose as a jacket for colder weather. Its sturdy, and a nice material, and does what it needs to do."
4.0,So far these boots are pretty good!
4.0,The dress is beautiful but smaller than size
4.0,Runs big but is very soft and stretchy material.
4.0,The sandals are VERY great quality but the only problem i had was the instructions on the clear straps until i found a video how to use them. first u put the left stamp on then tap it around ur leg and then buckle it on the right. and also GET ONE SIZE BIGGER i had to return them because it was a little small
4.0,The unusually small waist makes them very uncomfortable!
4.0,I love this necklace it is perfect for everyday wear.
4.0,"I live here in Texas, and although we had a hot and humid weather, this vest is very light and refreshing. I use it probably twice or three times a week when at work."
4.0,Super cute  love that it's adjustable
4.0,"Cute dainty rings, just what I wanted. Good quality."
4.0,"I thought I would love the Ocean Blues Women's Adjustable High Waisted Bikini Bottom Tummy Control Tankini Swimsuit because the style seemed perfect to contour my core and hide my problem areas,<br /><br />The bottoms I received fit much too large, and the cut was triangular, which seems more suited for pear-shaped figures with wider hips and larger thighs.<br /><br />I am more apple-shaped with slender hips, thin legs, a wider waist, and more tummy than booty.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5'3"", 117 lbs and received this tankini bottom in size medium. It fit me like a generous size large. The leg openings were too large, and there were significant gaps between the suit and my skin.<br /><br />I wear a size medium in one piece swimwear, and a size small in leggings. I have to assume different size rules apply to swimwear separates, and a size small, or x-small would have been the correct fit since I wear a size 2 in women's jeans.<br /><br />I am going to base my rating on the overall quality of this swimsuit bottom. They are well made, and the seams are sewn straight with no loose or hanging threads, They would probably look lovely in the correct size and especially with the right shape."
4.0,"I LOVE the bra, it was comfortable and supported me without a problem.<br />However... the tights gave me a diaper/uni-butt appearance, like I just had 1 butt cheek, so unfortunately I have to return it. Wish I could keep the bra though.<br />The set overall was great quality, but the butt was a total mood killer. Ordered a L for those who were wondering."
4.0,Was super comfy. Just wasn't really much of a v neck and sleeves were a little tight. Other than that it was beautiful.
4.0,Bought this for a gift.  I thought it a bit dull and too navy blue for a Van Gogh replica but friend loved it.
4.0,I bought this a week ago and it's already here it's the 28th of Sept. Wasnt suppose to be here till October 22. I bought a XXXL or 3X. With reviews I was very skeptical. How ever I am surprisingly very happy with it. I weight 340lbs. The arms are long and baggy which I love. The hoodie is amazing. The waist is a little snug but not uncomfortable. Also zips up fine. If they had a size bigger id only get it for the stomach area and for more baggyness. But I still love the size I got now. It also stretches a bit it's not very long. Like mid waist but looks cute. It comes from cali when ordered from this vendor. Its thicker than I thought and very warm. Doesn't smell weird.  I recommend air drying because of the designs. So overall. Even tho I was worried. I'm pleased.  I'd buy again
4.0,"i liked these shirts.  they are very thin, but my daughter likes that and it is good for layering.  colors very nice.  i bought 2 sizes up because they are all cotton - glad i did although the sleeves seemed a little long to me.  i was very happy when the price dropped, which is what tipped the scale in buying these shirts."
4.0,Looks just like model
4.0,"I really like this necklace. It is so cute, but it is a little wide which makes it a bit uncomfortable to wear. This is probably just a matter of personal preference, but since I don't wear it often due to this reason I am only giving 4 stars."
4.0,It’s a woman’s cut T-shirt - tight fitting.<br />Fabric is soft.
4.0,"Great for race day! The colors were true to the picture, arrived in a protective plastic casing with no wrinkles!"
4.0,They work well. I really like the clear one.
4.0,"These sunglasses are very stylish and give just enough darkness and protection on the sunny snowy day. Upstate New York, sadly a little tight on my nose but fit my wives knows very well – the nose pieces are a bit adjustable maybe I'll play around with them a little more, good value"
4.0,"It worked out perfect for me, so when I drive and have to read the dashboard I can see all the small lettering."
4.0,my only complaint is the watch was a little bigger than I taught.
4.0,Fit good and good length
4.0,"Really cute dress. Material is not that breathable, though. Also, it is a little short. I'm 5'4&#34; and if I bend over I'm a little self conscious. Otherwise a cute dress to throw on for a cool summer night."
4.0,"Had to cut 5 inches and hem the bottom. I ordered a medium, but a large came in which is fine since I'm using them as Pjs. They're breathable and light weight. The bottoms didn't have elastic, so I wouldn't use them for yoga too much. But they're good to lounge in."
4.0,"It’s a beautiful dress! Especially for the price I feel beautiful, confident appropriate for a lady. I’m a 36j (42” bust) 33” waist 45” hips basically a perfect hour glass and it is super hard to find dresses that compliments my frame with out being to sexy or matronly this definitely a must have for the curvy girl w a small waist. That being said it’s not well made came w minor snags and the edges are frayed (but in the inside only) so I will ware gently and dry clean only to try to extend the life of this this show stopper. I can’t wait to wear to church on Sunday."
4.0,"I used the dress a posh spice costume for school, it fit like I thought but it was really hot wearing it though"
4.0,"Nice stone, would like the chain a little thinner but others probably wouldn't mind it."
4.0,Fit good some bending required to fit. Everyone's different. No problems
4.0,"The first choker in the product picture is too big on me, but the rest fit perfectly fine. clasps on two of the choker are really bad quality,and have turned copper before they arrived in the mail. Otherwise the rest are in good condition"
4.0,very nice quality product.  We have had it over 6 months and it has held up well in the wash.  It is losing a slight bit of glimmer but my daughter wears it often.
4.0,Wish they made these bigger they would be the best ever hands down. I have a lot of hair so have to pull back to see these little things. If only had bigger. Bigger is better
4.0,Pretty dress but fits oversized. I returned it because I don’t like how it looks in my body. I’m size medium and that was the size that I ordered.
4.0,Nice purse.  The ability to change from short handle to long strap is nice.  Pretty color.
4.0,Came in a basic Pandora bag instead of the box that you would get buying it straight from the pandora store. For me that wasn't a big deal since I was going to rebox it for a gift but something to keep in mind. The bracelet was an original Pandora. Also be sure to order an extra inch or inch and a half than your actual wrist size or it will be too small because of the addition of charms.
4.0,"Was pretty long, even with heels. But it's a nice dress and super comfortable!"
4.0,They work great for grass and rocks. Just make sure you get the right size for your shoes.  I had to return these to get the medium size.
4.0,"One of the most comfortable, sturdy inserts I have tried"
4.0,"Couldn’t ask for a better dress for the price! I bought this dress knowing it could be awful, but was pleasantly surprised! It fits great and it’s perfect for a casual sunny day."
4.0,Fits low on foot which is perfect for my ballet flats. After washing they are looking worn on the edges. For the price it is to be expected.
4.0,This bracelet looks expensive. It is a nice size for a man. Beautiful clasp.
4.0,This item is completely sheer you need to buy something to wear under it other than that it's fantastic and worth every penny!
4.0,"Bought these slippers for my 88 year old father. He has swollen feet and it's hard to find shoes that fit him. These were adjustable in enough ways to get them on and off easily. The insert included with them were not sufficient. I bought some better ones and they worked out fine. The bottom of the shoes were very hard so I would not recommend wearing then for long periods of time or any great distance. My dad doesn't walk much, so it is fine for him."
4.0,"Great wallet. Good feel to it. Once you've put all your cards in the sleeves it does become difficult to put them into the bottom sleeve, but that might just be a &#34;not worn in yet&#34; issue. RFID protection for the win."
4.0,"This chiffon kimono with lace trim is cute. This looks simple and nice, and it can be worn over a swimsuit or over casual wear, in both cases this adds a nice (dare I say casually elegant) touch to casual wear and/or a swimsuit. Overall I like it, it is also very generously sized, so it looks fluffy and nice."
4.0,"I like the loose fit and the length. Material is heavy enough to wear out in public. Only complaint is the blend of cotton is not as soft as I like, otherwise I like it and will wear it this summer."
4.0,"She's not big enough for the xs size (4), so I bought toddler size.  Product is well made, etc., but there's a big difference between fitting into a 2t and a 4t, so this only fit my daughter for about 4 months."
4.0,"This is a nice loose fitting top for casual wear.  The sleeves are form-fitting, but the bodice is wide and loose.  The front is shorter than the back, which is open.  I wore it with a tank top in a cooler day and it is lightweight but has some warmth.  The best part may be the price!  I ordered 3 colors in size large, which is what si usually buy in a top.  The x-large was just too big, and I may if fit into a medium if ai wanted a slightly more tailored look."
4.0,Good quality but the length is short. Not cropped but short.
4.0,"I pic the wrong size, dress is beautiful but not my size"
4.0,Not as big as I'd  like but a good fashion piece...that's also a good analog watch.
4.0,"Super cute, i have never seen a swimsuit top like this before, but it does run small. I am 34 D and the M top fit but i felt very riskay since it did not cover much. I think the large would have been perfect, but the medium bottoms fit like a glove."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful<br />Run small
4.0,Easier access to what I'm looking for. The size is great too because my bag is bursting at the seams.
4.0,"I ordered this set with the intention of using it for a flower girl gift. But I should've paid closer attention to the item description, as the pieces are much bigger than I thought they would be. From the pictures, the set looks like rose gold roses, but when they arrived, they look more like pieces that have been painted pink. Still a nice set, but not as cute in person as in the pictures."
4.0,Gloves are as expected for the price. Soft and warm.
4.0,Runs slightly small BUT still super comfortable.
4.0,I used this gift box instead of the box that housed the antique necklace I received at the time of purchase.  The lighted box beautifully displayed the diamond necklace.  Glad I spent the extra money on the box.
4.0,The sleeves are to long on the short sleeve shirt
4.0,"just as good as the name brand loom.  my kids do the expert bracelets on it with no problems.  Ibought 3 of them for each child.  one did break, which was probably just a defect. it is prime so no issues they just retuned my money.  the name brand loom we had broke too so...I wouldn't think anything of it"
4.0,It's nice but runs small and cleavage is deep
4.0,Very nice quality. Was a little snug but fits ok. Definitely holds the girls where they are suppose to be.
4.0,"I ordered a size up thinking i'll grow into them. but these run a bit bigger than anticipated. I usually wear a large and that fits nicely. I ordered an XL and they seem a bit too big, but i'm not drowning in it.<br /><br />The fabric is lightweight and soft, which is great, but i'm afraid these won't last very long with regular wear.<br /><br />Good to have in rotation if you have lots of workout gear, but not something you can use regularly.<br /><br />I'm 5'10 180lbs wearing an XL"
4.0,It was a long for coming but I liked and for the price is pretty good . I recommend it if
4.0,"Nothing special about these little tie clips, but they serve their purpose, look good, and don't cost a fortune. Highly recommended."
4.0,"Very breathable, nice fit, and great to wear while fishin!"
4.0,"I was VERY wary about buying this sweater because I've been burned before by clothes (mostly sold by companies overseas) being much too small. The price was low, shipping was free, and there were free returns, so I decided to give it a chance and I'm very glad that I did. It fits perfectly. You'll definitely need a solid camisole inside, but otherwise it seems to be well made. I haven't washed it yet and can see how snags might become a problem at some point, but so far, so good."
4.0,The owl necklace shipped fast. I got many compliments on it when I wore yesterday. I will definitely be buying two more for my friends. It is huge but I love it. And I love it because the owls body is a mirror  so I can check my make up LOL
4.0,"I ordered a XXXL just to be safe, and it's a little snug on my XXL body. I'll make it work but it won't look as loose as the photo shows. I will blame myself on this purchase though, I don't think I read the &#34;materials its made of&#34; closely being I got it on Prime Day I was more in a hurry to get the deal! The color itself is that rich plum and I love that :)"
4.0,"Am slowly building up a supply of items for my 20-month-old granddaughter to have at my house when she stays overnight, and these were a big hit! She picked out her own new everyday shoes, but will pull them off in an instant to wear her &#34;Do-wi&#34; shoes. I like the elastic that keeps them from falling off, and the fit was spot on. Haven't had to wash them yet, but hope they will withstand that test."
4.0,"I only wish that it had a lates free waist. It’s sowed in and I had to cut it out and put a drawstring in. I love that it’s 100% cotton, good on my skin and so comfortable I never want to wear another skirt"
4.0,Works great with the original Pebble Steel. Can be a dust magnet though.
4.0,"Quality of the product is amazing, but sometimes it nicks the back of my hair and I always need to dis attach my hair from the necklace."
4.0,"I don't know what it is about handcrafted jewelry, but I really like them. Theses are quite nice looking and it is very  noticeable. These earrings are very nice looking and they are noticeable, even with my long hair."
4.0,"This dress is very pretty and just what I was looking for. I read that it runs small so I ordered a size up. I am  size 14 and ordered a 16. I had to send it back and order an 18 because the 16 was too small. Once I got the right size though, I love it! It will be wonderful in pictures on our family cruise!"
4.0,Nice quality PJ set... but it was a tad smaller than I would have wanted. My 2 year old GD is petite in height but average weight and the top is just a little too short in length. I would size up for comfort :-)
4.0,Love the price and beautiful floral print great color and looks just like picture<br />Runs a little small I would say a size mallet than what we were expect but with the tie up top around the neck should work fine!!
4.0,Really love this dress as a quick casual go to or can be dressed up with accessories.  I bought my usual size and had no issues with the fit.  As predicted in other reviews it's a little short but that's great for me  I'm 5'2&#34; and it's the perfect length.  I can wear it with flats or heels.
4.0,Both daughters love the style of this shoe.  I bought them a little big for them to grow into...but I'm sure they will be the perfect soon.
4.0,I love this shades! Such vibe and stylish look! Light but sturdy and not cheap feeling..
4.0,Worked well for what I needed. I just wasn't of the pants were designed. Other than that they came on time and looked great on my son.
4.0,"Nice quality , vegetarian daughter loved it. Bought another one for her friend. I would recommend it."
4.0,Daughter likes them. Good for exercise and to lounge around the house. Shorts could be a tad bit longer
4.0,Cute top. Will<br />Look great over some jeggings withsome boots!
4.0,The hat itself was good quality I just didn't like the way it fit me. I did return it.
4.0,"Fits our skinny three year old very well, and she loves the shirt."
4.0,I bought these for the women at my job. They thought they were cute.
4.0,"Love these. I was looking everywhere for funky high-end looking evil eye drop earrings like the ones Aldo had and these were the closest so I’m happy. They definitely give me Betsey Johnson vibes. Not mad at that. But I will say looking at it again the pearl detail at the very top is not as big as what is pictured so I'm a little disappointed about that because that's what initially drew my eye to these, the pearl detail. The last picture shown in the box is more accurate and I'm guessing these are ""knock offs"" from the original design shown in the first 5 product images because the color of the crystals are very different. But other than, cute! Also liked that extra backings were included!"
4.0,"Daughter loved these!  Handed them out after a speech..all the highschoolers loved them.  Sometimes the keychains come off, but then she would just tie them around the neck.  Worth the money though!"
4.0,little smaller then expected but still fits! great comfort though!
4.0,"Nice band, fits well."
4.0,Nothing on the back
4.0,"Fits beautiful, my only issue was the buttons, keep come undone need to be a little larger"
4.0,Exactly what I wanted! So cute!!
4.0,My feet feel better with these insoles. Can wear shoes comfortably all day.
4.0,"What’s not to love about a cozy soft sweater with a cat face and ears on it? Nothing, that’s what. My only suggestion is that they consider having the eyes embroidered on instead since the current eyes can easily peel off after a couple washes."
4.0,I had to return this dress because it was too large in the waist. I'm not complaining. I don't think I've had to say that since before I had children. Ha Ha. The material is a cotton faile/lycra blend so there's plenty of give. I normally wear a size 10p in Ann Taylor just to give people an idea of sizing. I ordered a Medium. It fit except for the waist. It didn't sit at my waist but closer to my chest. I'm a bit long waisted.
4.0,Me agradó el producto<br />Buena calidad
4.0,The strap is good quality. However it had a strong chemical smell when I pulled it out of the package. It took a few days to go away but was very nauseating. I have big wrists so the buckle sits almost on the side if my wrist instead of the bottom. This seems to be typical of nato straps on large wrists but I will keep looking for one with a better fit.
4.0,Wash & Wear well!
4.0,"Nice, simple sandals. I like synthetic slip-on sandals, have used various for traveling and find them very useful and convenient. These are likely serve that same purpose very well. Construction is simple, and tough. Traction against my foot is comfortable, easy to slip in without worries of the sandal slipping off. Traction walking is basic, with decent treads that will wear smooth with time."
4.0,Cute design/fabric.  Reminded me of the PJs my kids wore as preschool aged kids.  My tall slim 10 YO did not fit in this though - much too baggy through crotch to be long enough on legs.  He was disappointed to just use mario sweatshirt instead of this as a costume.
4.0,"Tight on my thighs area. But other than that, it's super cute and got here very fast!"
4.0,So pretty and cute for the beach parties
4.0,Ehhh... it’s OK. It doesn’t really look like the picture. The puffy sleeves are not as defined. It’s a little thin but I really wasn’t buying it for warmth  I mean for crying out loud it’s a bolero jacket… LOL!  It’s just ok
4.0,I purchased the 0-3 and it was way too big and had to return. These were more like 3-6 if not larger
4.0,No sé su durabilidad ya que son  nuevas. Parecen  irresistibles. Bastante cómodas y fácil de regular.
4.0,"It is a good search engine of good quality, but I recommend ordering 2 sizes more than the ones they use, I asked for L and the person to whom I give it is M and even so it is small. it's pretty but the sizes are too small. 😉"
4.0,"I like the necklace, which has nice color and weight.  However, be aware it is 18 inches, not 16 as advertised.  It is longer than I really wanted (I wanted it right below my throat) so I take one star away for false advertising."
4.0,"Absolutely love these shorts. They are comfortable and just a bit stretchy so they have a flexible fit. They contour your body and make your ""back end"" look nice. The leg holes have the ripped look which go almost all the way around. The design is a bit distressed, but not overdone and still has a clean and modern look to them. The sides have a small perforation, which loosens the fit around the legs and provides some extra comfort. The quality of the fabric is also nice and doesn't feel cheap. We live in Miami where you can wear shorts almost all year round but with the high humidity, quality of jeans is important. These feel very light and do good in the high temperatures and humidity. Overall a nice pair of jean shorts and not too expensive."
4.0,This tank dress is very comfortable and cute. Great for lazing around home or even a casual date.
4.0,This is a cool watch. Well made and the feeling of wood against the skin is very nice. It comes large and was easy to size for my husbands wrist. It looks very handsome on his wrist and most importantly he likes it!!  He's pretty hard to please. I wish they had a watch like this for ladies.
4.0,The fit is great! I’m just to short! At 5’2 they looked like MC Hammer pants! With a slight Alterations they are the perfect fit!
4.0,Would just fit kids.
4.0,The dress is very comfortable and I received a lot of compliments! BUT... It doesn't have pockets like the photo shows so I had to take away one star for disappointed.
4.0,Love the look but not the most comfortable ring.
4.0,Only complaint is the end of the fabric isn't hemmed. Just cut.
4.0,"These are very small and very dainty looking earrings. We knew they would be small from the description but to be honest they are a little smaller than we even expected. I actually thought it would be just a tad bigger, but for a child or just someone who wants really small and delicate looking hoops, these are very pretty and very shiny!"
4.0,little small for an adult
4.0,"Ok, full disclosure. I recieved this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review.<br />So these ""key organizers"" are all the rage right now. ""Keep your keys organized, and always ready"", or words to that effect, and dozens of products that are basically variations on the exact same theme can be found almost everywhere.<br />When I ordered this organizer,  I thought ""it's gonna be the same tired idea as all the others"". However, I discovered that I was wrong! Yes, this is the ""same"" design as ALL the competition, but there are some added elements that have been well thought out and unique. There are also some quirks, but more on that later.<br />First I'll start with the positives:<br />The organizer is shipped with a variety of different length..axles, for lack of a better term. These axles allow one to adjust the actual thickness of the organizer, from 1/4-1 1/4"". Only got a couple keys?  The 1/4"" axles will probably work fine. For a LOT of keys, the 1 1/4"" axles will probably be a better fit.<br />Second, this kit includes washers to go between the keys. Lots of washers! (These are necessary so you can only pull out one key at a time, but many kits don't include them, or only include a few.<br />Thirdly, the included bottle opener/screw driver/wrench tool is a nice touch. It's not great, but it'll do in a pinch.<br />Now for the negatives:<br />The frame is a bit large, almost 4"" in length, so if you have small hands utter may prove difficult to operate. Also, in spite of its large size, it's not large enough to fit standard size house keys end to end,  which requires you to stagger them, either top to bottom, or side to side. I tried my sample with some old padlock and PO box keys, and had to end up staggering them so they would all fit.<br />The other negative is the instructions. They are just a series of pictures, that show the organizer being assembled. Here's a hack I discovered: place a washer on the axle between the frame and the key. Then place the key on top of the washer. On the other axle, place 3 washers on the frame, then the second key. Go back to the first axle and add 2 washers, then another key. Now go to the second axle and add 2 washers and another key. Keep this up, alternating sides (adding 2 washers each time) until you have put all your necessary keys into the frame. Add a final washer on each axle, then the other side of the frame, finishing off with the included screws. Be patient with the assembly, it's quite fiddly. (This method will result in an organizer that is rather ""thick"" but not very ""tall"", and is a lot less likely to snag on things.)<br />Now for the part of the review where I answer the question ""Would I Spend My Money On This?""  Yes, I would. The advantage of having different thicknesses, as well as the included ""multi-tool"" in addition to the inclusion of some washers make this a ""good buy""."
4.0,Was nice. My issues were the armholes were too big. I'm a B cup not much more would fit in the top of this dress because the chest was tight.
4.0,"I bought because I needed a small carryon that would fit under seat. If course because it is small, it would not hold all of my items. The spinner wheels worked well. I sent back before I used for a trip."
4.0,Wish strap was longer but it's a sweet bag
4.0,They give him room to grow otherwise I am very pleased with the jeans.
4.0,Way bigger in person
4.0,I did see how it was going to do that and it didn't.<br />But you can blow it up; not bad. It was a smaller size and fit our needs.
4.0,It fits snug. So if your a big guy with big guy muscles and a keg  vs a 6 pack you'll  need to keep that in mind around  the stomach area.
4.0,"This dress was packaged well. Came nicely folded in package.  The material has a stretch to it but the size runs a little small.  I simply adore the color of the dress, the gold accents are amazing."
4.0,delivered as advertised
4.0,I liked the material and color of the shirt 👕.
4.0,"So I had gotten this in two sizes because I wasn't sure which was going to be more true, for my body I found that it fit pretty close to size. This was for my sisters wedding! And it was super cute, she just gave us a color we needed to have and said no sleeves otherwise we could wear whatever. This is actually one that I had picked out of 2 to wear to the wedding, but it turned out the girl next me picked the same dress. My sister didnt want them being the same since no one else was the same. So the only reason I returned was because of my sisters request. And it was her day.<br />But this was comfortable, and cool for the hot summer wedding I was in! Stayed on fine and I like the way the ruffles would flow. super cute, if needed for an invent again I would get this dress. I thought it was nice."
4.0,"This dress runs smaller. I wear a medium, 5'4 148lbs. I ordered a large and it still fit a little more snug for what I like.  The dress is gorgeous though and flattering. I returned the dress because the collar opening was not as wide as shown in the picture and I loved that about the dress. Actually, my collar came together and looked more like a slit style keyhole opening. The dress was flattering on my lower body but I have large breast and the top portion did not fit the way I like. I do wish it did because it's a gorgeous dress. I so wanted to keep it."
4.0,"Lovely quality product. I normally wear a US 22 dress/pants, and 1-2X. Bought the 4X (says to use for US 3X) thinking buying approx. 2 sizes up would be enough. I need to leave the ribbon out of the last holes to get it to stretch the whole way, and the back doesn't close enough for the little flap of extender fabric to cover it. Thankfully, I'm wearing this over a leotard for a costume so it's not a big deal that there's a gap in the back. Order AT LEAST a size or two up - maybe safer to order 3 sizes up. Wish I'd gotten the 5XL=US 4XL or even a size bigger than that. I'm 5'4&#34;, 245 lbs, and very &#34;apple&#34; shaped, if that helps anyone size it to themselves. The QUALITY is really great, and the material is very beautiful. I purchased the green one and the color was very accurate to the website photo, maybe just a shade or two lighter. The ribbon to lace it up in the back is the same yellow/gold as the piping on the bodice. I may buy the blue one for a Rapunzel costume as it looks rather purple in the photo, but will try buying a size up. :)"
4.0,"Nice suit.  Purchased for my daughter.  Covered well,  but still cute.  The hem in the top came loose after a few weeks,  but repaired easily.  This was my daughter's favorite this past summer."
4.0,"This choker is really cute and the faux leather is nice and  supple and comfortable. I would like for it to fit a little tighter but I knew when I ordered it that it would probably be looser than I’d like. I still like it,  it still looks nice."
4.0,It is slightly larger then regular size. The pad is easily worn off and starting to hurt my foot. I ended up buying a foot pad that is worth more than the shoes. Metal toe and sturdy bottom layer is very well build can withstand nails and heavy duty. The laces becomes loosen after a while. I had to tie a nut to make it tight.
4.0,"Just what I wanted, just is enormous on me, not just baggy."
4.0,quality made feels nice priced right
4.0,The fit was a bit smaller then I had imagined given the picture. Ordered true to size and sleeves were almost 3/4 and definitely not as loose fitting as I expected but think I’m still going to hang on to it- just recommend ordering a size up
4.0,"Very cute but they bend a little too easily. Awesome product for the price, though."
4.0,re a bit too large but that just means they will last longer! she does complain a bit about the glitter i couldnt tell if they were glittery or not she says they are scratchy....
4.0,"I received so many compliments, one fell off but other than that, all good!"
4.0,It rubs my daughters heel hard but I put some moleskin on the back and now they fit ok. Wish they wouldn’t call then toddler shoes. My kid is 17 and wears a 3 in shoes.
4.0,Good glasses. They are a bit scatchey around the ears.
4.0,"One of the earpieces is more curved, or maybe the other is too straight, don't know which.  Not like plastic wherein with a bit of hot water or steam, you can adjust as required.  Bamboo is not so pliable for one, and two, there are no instructions as to how this can be adjusted.  But the spring hinges do help make up for any fit differentiation between the two earpieces.  Not the ideal way for a fitting, but it seems to work, for me at least.  For the price, can't complain too much, and not dissatisfied enough to return.  Does have the classic shape, and being wood, is quite the enjoyable difference."
4.0,"I purchased this product for my brother and he loves it. The shipping was on time, the only set back is that the pendent itself is a little on the small side, other than that, it's made out of great material and I am very pleased with this purchased."
4.0,I like this dress and the flattering cut.  It fits and looks exactly like I expected from the pictures.  It's also very soft.  The only thing I do not like about it is that it is a little thin especially in places where it's fabric is a little stretched (across the bust for me).
4.0,I love the 2 face bandanas. I wear those ones to work and they are very comfortable. The material is more so of a cloth and not a see through mesh... which is a plus. The only issue I have with them is that they don’t come in different colors/solid.
4.0,Gray shirt for trip to Disney
4.0,These are thick and so soft. From the image I thought I was buying a multi-pack but it's only one pair. $13 for one pair of leggings seems like too much so I don't know that I'd buy them again but they are definitely warm and soft!
4.0,"Pretty shirt, split on sides come up a little high but ok."
4.0,Very very form fitting
4.0,Fits very well. Love the ear slides
4.0,"They were smaller than I thought.  But they are great for running socks.<br />So instead of being hiking socks, they are now used for running.<br />Unexpected but good enough anyhow.<br />If you want actual hiking socks maybe order a size larger than you think."
4.0,The grandkids like these goggles to swim in the pool
4.0,"Lovely dress! It was a little long for me however, still cute!"
4.0,It’s pretty & fits well. The tie off strands are all visible though.
4.0,The color was on point and the size was too! But I do need alterations only to fit the length of the skirt... Which was expected! Other than that it's great
4.0,"Bought this for my 2yo because I loved the chin strap feature to guarantee his ears are covered out in the cold. However, where the  Velcro is sewn on, it does not fit as snug as it should under his chin. Thinking about sewing some Velcro in a tighter placement."
4.0,"Really like it but runs small.  XL too tight and I wear a large, sometimes an XL at the most."
4.0,The green is gorgeous. I ordered a size up and it fits well. The only thing I don't love is that the waistband is pleated. In some of the previous reviews it looks like the skirt used to be sold with a regular/flat waistband that looks more like a belt and is more fitted. But I still like it. It will be too long if you are short. I'm 5'7&#34; and will need to wear heels so I don't trip on it.
4.0,"Build quality is excellent.  However, check the size carefully - smaller than what I expected."
4.0,"They are extremely comfortable, however I cannot give 5 stars to this product because the elastic around the top of the sock wore out after one wash. These socks are adorable and look great with any pair of flats."
4.0,"This top is pretty cute. I live in Florida, so I appreciate that the weight of the fabric is lighter than I expected. It was a nice surprise. This is definitely not a sweater type material, more like a long sleeve t-shirt type material. Perfect for me. The fit is slim, not too baggy - fits as it appears in the product shot. The image is faded to begin with, but I think that gives it a vintage style."
4.0,"This is a cute coverup! The fit is a bit baggy, but I wouldn't order a size down because it is very short."
4.0,Extremely thin! So don’t expect it to soak up much slobber. Super cute though! Perfect for a bib she will only wear one day out of the house! (I bought “My first Easter” and it was exactly what I wanted except that it could have been thicker.
4.0,"I am 5'7 with long legs and weight 152 lbs. I ordered the small and they fit me well. (Note that I have slender hips and thighs.) Unfortunately, I ordered the tall bootcut. They are really long! I have to cuff them in flats and even with heals, they reach the floor. I wish I hadn't gotten the talls or even just not the bootcut. (Cuffing bootcuts are dumb.) But I love them anyway."
4.0,Cheaper material and somewhat small but I kept it
4.0,I did not expect the Gucci name at the bottom of the lenses.
4.0,These Are so amazing and soft! I did however after 4 times where them get a hole in the waist band I can still wear them but it's a bummer.
4.0,"Awesome conversation starter and a good way to take a little bit of the 80s with you to business meetings, while looking cool."
4.0,"120 pounds, 24 inch waist. While these pants were cute, and not too long on my short legs, they weren’t nearly as fitted as I would like, and definitely longer on the waist than your standard “high waisted” pants."
4.0,Works great for everyday use and cleans easily after working out
4.0,"Bought dress to use in Christmas pictures. Dress was tight in stomach area...so I just stood behind some prompts. I would buy again,just go up two sizes. It is great if your body is in shape! Lol."
4.0,"The dark red on the cheetah hoodie isn't nearly as dark as the picture but still very cute. It's a thinner style hoodie but very cute to wear with jeans or leggings. I do recommend ordered a size up. I order a XXL I normally wear either L or XL. It's a loose but fitted loose on me of that makes sense. Overall if you are looking for something comfortable, nice and not a basically hoodie buy this."
4.0,or maybe it is 3 but it works well enough and any kid would be pleased with it.  should last a while; metal not plastic
4.0,"Very cute and different earrings. The only issue was that two stones were missing with only one of those stones in the bottom of the plastic envelope it came in. So, I glued in the available one and plan on snipping off the metal piece that contained the missing stone. Not a huge deal because they were so inexpensive and I rarely return anything."
4.0,"This is a pretty nice tank, quite comfortable, as little bigger than I expected. The shelf bra isn't super supportive, and I found the band to be a little looser than I would need, but now that my milk has come in the cup area seems to be a little small to contain &#34;the girls.&#34; unless I'm wearing it to bed, I do tend to wear a bra with this. I do like that the torso isn't skin tight but is longer than the average shirt."
4.0,"It's funny I got an invite to write a review on these earrings today: I'm wearing them now!  I don't get much opportunity to wear earrings because I am an RN and don't wear earrings to work. I originally bought these earrings and like for Baby Shower Prizes.  Needless to say, the prizes went over splendidly: everyone is so bored with Bath & Body Works Gifts and buying Glass Spun Jewelry is just as costly and can even be less costly than the expensive Brand Soaps and Perfumes.<br />I was a little Disappointed at the size, though my spacial concept is undoubtedly lacking; the heart shapes are about as big as my thumbnail.<br />I really do love these earrings: They're light, simple, I love the way plays around them.  I am an advocate for glass jewelry because a friend of mine, who loves wearing jewelry, is allergic to most metals and therefore can't wear standard jewelry. I attended a craft fair at the Local Museum and stumbled upon Glass Spun pendants with ribbon necklaces. It was the perfect gift for my friend! She can still wear earrings and she supposes that would be because there is less contact area, we don't really know but she's happy to still be able to wear jewelry."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:f945d47fbb22afbe9587ae15201369bc]] Who cares if the rings fit or not, the important thing is they're durable enough to last hours and hours of feline entertainment. The ultimate ""fetch"" for the occasional cat that enjoys playing fetch!"
4.0,I love the pendant but the silver chain is too delicate to last long.
4.0,"I periodically get neck pain, so these are perfect for watching TV while lying comfortably in bed, with my neck fully supported, and my face pointing up to the ceiling. I can wear them over my glasses with no problem."
4.0,Bought these to use in our roof deck with our rectangular shade for a party theme.  It was great! Not great quality but you get what you pay for... It was OK for our use
4.0,t shirt was way too small...im 6'4 230lbs...but it fit my disabled sister 5'10 140lbs perfectly...she has a deformed spine and for some reason this fit her great and she wouldn't let me return it.I contacted the company with my story and they let my sister keep the shirt and refunded the cost.They said they would look into the sizing problem and were glad it made my sister happy...now that's customer service.
4.0,I normally wear a size small; but I ordered a medium due to the reviews and it fits perfect. I am impressed with the quality and I love how long it is. I am looking forward to wearing it.
4.0,Was a nice shapping bra but fell apart fast.
4.0,"I ordered a large based of the review pictures, it seemed like I could size down but I should have ordered my size (XL) or even gonna up a size to have looser fit in the arms but fitted everywhere else. The arms were a little bit snug but its still wearable."
4.0,Like the fit . Not too loose and length is just right.
4.0,Cute for a kid’s cowboy-themed party!
4.0,"I was a casual cyclist, sometimes recreationally riding, and occasionally commuting. I was totally amazed at the difference padded shorts (in combination with skin lubricant) made to the quality of the experience. I loved my bike before, but these dramatically reduced &#34;seat fatigue&#34;, and I am so glad I tried them. These particular shorts are fine - I have washed them a few times in the regular wash (again, dealing with skin lubricant), and they hold up well. To be fair, I haven't tried more expensive shorts. But for a starter cyclist, these are well worth it."
4.0,It's a okay watch it's hard to read a digital timing
4.0,was a good buy for a gift.
4.0,"I am 5'9&quot; and 146 lbs, I bought size M, and I it fits OK but definitely not flattering at all. I am returning it because the dress waist line is higher than my own, and when I wrap the belt around, I can see the waist line seam above the belt. The overall length of the dress was OK, knee length. Also, the fabric is rather unpleasant to touch."
4.0,"My dislike was the material.  Usually Amelieboutik is a heavier knit material that sculpts your curves. This<br />material is too light and does not fit my curves.  The color pink is too light also for my color of my hair. It<br />washes me out. I would love the style in a dark purple. I really appreciate when Amelieboutik has pretty colors<br />of hot pink, bright purple, bright blue, red, a purple burgundy not dark burgundy.  There is way too much black tops and not enough colors to choose from especially hot pink and bright red.  Would love to see more colors coming this Spring and Summer. I love boatneck tops and cut out shouder tops and off the shoulder tops. Love<br />the lace up the back tops and halter tops."
4.0,This was a great purchase! I bought the black color. It works well as a casual dress and I tied a silk black bow around my waist to make it more semi-formal. Very comfortable and I love the pockets! It was slightly thin and I was paranoid that it would be see through so I also wore a black tank top underneath. Still a great buy for the price.
4.0,I bought this for my sister and i think it is so cute. She felt like she fit in with my mother and my infinity tattoos. it is a wonderful gift for children and comes in different colors.
4.0,I have not yet had the opportunity to wear them yet because the event that I purchased them for had not occurred but based on a preliminary &#34;try on&#34; I expect it get a lot of compliments
4.0,"This top is perfect.  Looks exactly how it appears in the photo. Washes beautifully, drip dries in less than 1 hour on a hanger &  No wrinkles !"
4.0,It was hard to breathe than others but maybe becuase its better quality and protection
4.0,I had rotator cuff surgery and liked the idea of having a shirt like this for easy on/easy off. Unfortunately the snaps rubbed on my skin under my arm and made it very uncomfortable to wear. Other than that the shirt fit well and was easy to get on and off.
4.0,"First, let me say that I consider the EYEKEEPPER sun readers an excellent product which I use every day. BUT not with these which give an orange tint to every image. HOWEVER, I like them for night driving in which headlight beam bursts of horizontal and vertical light are greatly reduced allowing you to see with the on coming lights much better with clearer definition.  That's a big deal for my wife and I for night driving.  After some use lens mounting screws come loose and the frames are not practical.  I do like the lens for special use.  The reduced tint in these are useful but the frames are not.  A XceLite P-3 tiny nut driver will make your life a little better repairing these glasses."
4.0,So cute but a bit too pricey for a one time wear. Worked perfectly though for the wedding.  Cutest flower girl:).
4.0,Quality is low but they still look nice though nowhere to put a filter in so they are really thin
4.0,Appears to be well constructed. Gave it to a friend who collects sweatshirts from US States. She swears by it (not AT it--by it).<br /><br />Good prodcut.
4.0,"I read the reviews and sized up to an XL, it sits fairly baggy - which is fine. I'd say stick true to size if you want it to look like the photos. The material is a lot thinner than I was expecting but for the price, that seems right. It works well as a sweater to wear on a crisp summer night."
4.0,Cute but a lil big.
4.0,Soft and comfortable dress. The black part of the skirt is a little hot and the material is not super breathable.
4.0,"It’s cute, fabric is good not great. Biggest thing is to size up for the wait band in the pants, I’m normally a size small and the large size for me most comfortably."
4.0,I looove this dress in a XXL. I wear a 16 normally. I have tried to order more been unable to find this same material and sizing. Only give 4 stars because I can’t find to order again.
4.0,"Beautiful pins, very  professional looking. Stands out"
4.0,"Easy to unbox, easy to clip on, and very fashionable. I absolutely love this. I'm a cool cat anyway. Lol."
4.0,"A little over priced for the simple technology, a little difficult to use for being so simple, moderately accurate, and occasional connection issues."
4.0,These earrings are very nice and colorful.  They are flimsy and every time I put them on I am very careful.  The price was great so if they break I will still be thankful I got them.
4.0,"It looks just like the picture, but it runs very large. I wear a 12 maybe a 14 at times and I should've gotten the medium... maybe even a small.  I didn't want it to cling in the wrong places, but that is not possible with this dress."
4.0,"Need to include sizing information and guidelines with product.  Reviews are all over the place as far as fit.  Made it very hard to decide what size to buy. Some say they run large, some say they run small.  Our son is 6' 2' 180 and the large did fit but was snug, would have been better off to go with gut instinct and buy XL.  Otherwise the product is acceptable and seems to be well made.  Time will tell after washing."
4.0,"For this turtle neck sweater, you could order down a size and still find it comfortable.  I ordered my typical size and it was bigger than expected but it made it perfect for wearing with leggings.  It's soft and cozy and well made."
4.0,"It's too large on me so it does not fit like in the picture, but it is good quality and does the job."
4.0,"These pins are super cute, great quality material, almost 2 1/2 inches long, very sturdy. They are very thick as you can see in the picture so be aware of that before poking it in a fabric because it might leave a big hole. Overall great product. I totally recommend it!"
4.0,"They were well made, had an Extra inside pocket for...."
4.0,"Enzomar’s four leaf clover necklace is pretty. The rose gold chair is accented with a purple and green stoned 4 leaf clover (some may refer to it as shamrock). The pendant isn’t really that large, equal to or a little smaller than a dime. The Swarovski crystals are subtle but definitely add something special to the design. Overall, this is super cute especially if you like 4 leaf clovers or are fortunate enough to be born on St. Patrick's Day. This necklace is very giftable for either yourself or someone else."
4.0,"Others were at stated on size, this one a little toghtwr"
4.0,Very happy with this purchase. It fits as expected.
4.0,"It’s an okay ring, basically what I expected. It’s just a bit bigger than what the size says. It’s also not very comfortable...but overall it works for the look I’m going for."
4.0,"Super cute suit! Fit was as expected. I'm short, just shy of 5'2&#34; and 120lbs. I bought a medium which fit fine. I also have large chest, 34DD, but I'm happy with the fit there too. There is extra padding you can put in the cups if you're smaller chested."
4.0,"Pretty top. Color and fit true to image. I have two complaints, however. First, the material is already beginning to pill after only three times wearing it. Second, there is no band inside with which to hang it. Since its neck is so wide, it just falls off of hangers, so unless you have the special hangers that cling to material, this is one for the drawer and a quick spin in the dryer before wearing."
4.0,She's ugly not my favorite but they do a great job.
4.0,Warm but I thought they would be waterproof - but are not
4.0,"Average thickness, colors much brighter than on the screen, reasonably soft.  Haven't used or washed them yet so can't comment on colorfastness or durability."
4.0,"I hand washed it and the clear cold soapy water, it turned water brown. Like a tea bag would also I wear size 14 or 16 depending on cut and this is very tight more like a 12.<br />Worried what I was putting my hands into. Soaked in fresh soapy water to have it do it again mind you it's blue skort kept coming out brown water buy washing on low cold stopped mid cycle to find it brown water again started it a 3rd and 4 the more wash. It's much cleaner but didn't come clean till 5th."
4.0,"I avoid driving at dusk or later when possible, but these classes are helpful to cut the glare from ambient as well as oncoming traffic lights when such a need arises. They do not obstruct or obscure vision on front or sides, only sharpen what you see in adverse conditions, like at night or in the fog.<br /> I suspect that the plastic ‘lenses’ will scratch quite easily. Between uses, take care to store them in a small drawstring bag in the car’s jockey box, so they’re handy when needed.<br />I wish they were a little taller to fit better  over my fashionably large  Rx glasses, but the fit and coverage are adequate, rather than a fashion statement.<br />They’re not magic for night driving, but they are adequate and helpful."
4.0,"Here's a sports bra that does the job.  It has padded cups that I find appropriate for women with less than full figures; however, these cups are easily removed. What I particularly like is the level of support with this bra whether the cups are removed or retained.  No wires make this bra uncomfortable, and the back is very attractive.  Overall, this is a bra that works for working out."
4.0,"If you’re looking for a decent inexpensive tie this one may be for you. If you’re looking for a fancy tie then you will want to pass on this one. I personally liked this tie. It is made well and none of the threads were out of place. The colors are very vibrant and look very nice with a white dress shirt. While the “microfiber” material feels silk like it still felt a bit like polyester. It kind of reminded me of ties I owned when I was a kid.<br /><br />It says that the tie is dry clean only. By the way the tie feels it probably would be destroyed if put in the wash. However, I probably wouldn’t spend the money to take the tie to the dry cleaners either. Granted I don’t take any of my cloths to the dry cleaners. I am just careful and just don’t get crap on my tie.<br /><br />The pocket square for me is unfortunately something I will never use. It looks cool and I can see by wearing the tie and the square together you would look very sharp. I live in Arizona, in the middle of the desert, as in it is over 110 degrees here, so pocket squares for me have to be functional and not just look nice.<br /><br />For how much you pay for this tie it is decent. I think this is a great starter tie for a young man who is learning how to tie a tie for the first time. Would I wear this to a job interview, no. Would I wear this tie to church or work, yes. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"I realay liked the suit, it was just a tad to tight in the bust area."
4.0,"Pretty dress, fits just fine and not too short.  Looking forward to wearing."
4.0,pretty cool one
4.0,"Super comfortable!!! Love them! Size down, they run a little large"
4.0,"It was thinner than I expected it to be, but overall I like the material and fit on my daughter."
4.0,This was such an adorable dress! The print was the Burberry print which was in a good quality material. The bow that came with the dress however seemed like a ribbon they just cut and added. I would leave it out. Other than that- happy with the purchase!
4.0,"I really like the soft texture and draping of this cardigan; it's very comfortable. I have a black one and decided to order a white one. The color, however, is not true white. It's more like white with a purplish tint to it. So, I decided to return it and will look elsewhere for a truer white cardigan. I have not washed my black one yet (it's fairly new); I, therefore, can not comment on long-term durability or how it holds up during washing."
4.0,Nice for modesty when wearing a shelf bra top or sports bra. Good product for the price.
4.0,"I ordered a xl but I Normally wear a L.... the xl fit but I'll order a L next time.., but over all, it's very cute and the material is great"
4.0,"Good looking, but weak chain..pulls apart with a mild tug."
4.0,"My 2 year old son loves to wear his older brothers' cleats (which means we usually can't find them when we're looking for them, 😂🤦🏾‍♀️). So I bought him a pair of his own and he loves wearing them! He's in between size 7/8 in toddler and has a wide Foot. So I went with the 8 1/2. Fits him perfectly with a little room to grow. My only complaint is, for that age there's not really much of a color selection (at least that I liked anyway), but otherwise perfect cleat! 👌🏽"
4.0,So comfy. They had an odor before washing.probably the dye.
4.0,Soft and warm and helps keeps my bald head comfy during the winter. Great beanie for the price.
4.0,Very comfortable and good back suppprt. Purchased for my mom and myself
4.0,They are lovely but very hard to open. Once I got them open they worked just fine
4.0,I thought this was gonna fit me a little different it was super long for my liking I am 5'1 and it went way below the knee I am usually a size 12 pants so I ordered a XL and it fit well just super long.
4.0,Fits my daughter great!
4.0,"I really adore this cute dress, and I have received compliments all day long. The fit runs a bit larger but fit my hourglass frame perfectly. I love the tulip overlay to the sleeves and the fabric is shiny and fun. The print is very office appropriate. People have to get closer to tell it's dinosaurs which they love."
4.0,This dress is very cute but not the most flattering. It does cinch a bit where the elastic is but still overall is more of a comfy fit than flattering
4.0,This was a really nice white bathing suit. The thicker material means it wasn’t see thru which is nice. The only downside for me was the attached belt was way too small. Otherwise it would definitely get 5 stars.
4.0,"Great little product for the intended use.  I personally am using the rings as bands to store paint brushes together and help organize my art supplies.  Very handy for this purpose as there is just a little give to the silicone to make this work.  The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is that if I did want to use them as rings, the colors on some of them are a bit garish.  The gold for example looks very much like a costume gold plate so I would not want it as a substitute wedding ring.  Outside of the colors, the silicone rocks and the quality of the ring itself seems very good."
4.0,No complaints!!!!
4.0,"so far so good, not inexpensive but so far lives up to promises"
4.0,"i just ordered this jumper, and it fit very well, and comfortable, i will order more colors...."
4.0,"For me @ 5'9"", 175 lbs, and a 42"" bust, an XL turned out to be a little too revealing in the front once I tried it on. However that was nothing a pin couldn't fix..other than that, I like it."
4.0,These are a good quality knee high stocking. Fits nicely and doesn't squeeze at the top like some.
4.0,"Great quality and super cute pattern. Runs a bit smaller, it doesn’t have the stretchy back panel I thought it would have."
4.0,"I bought this before my Christmas trip to Wheeling, WV. It was COLD (20-40 F°) and this shacket worked great for layering. I live in Florida and it keeps me warm with a light jacket for colder FL days. I took off one star because the arm length was a little too awkwardly short, my hoodie underneath would stick out much further than the shacket (you can kind of see it in the photo). Roomy but not baggy. Cute, comfortable, and kept me warm! I’m 5’2, 132 pounds, 36D bra for reference."
4.0,good fit nice shirt
4.0,These slippers took a bit of walking in to break in. The sole is thick and non slip. They are a large and a little big for me. I usually wear a 7.5 and I think a medium would have fit better. They are very padded and soft with cute penguins.
4.0,Cute suit just not my favorite
4.0,"The neck hole was pretty big, like it wasn’t intended for toddlers. And it said the size was xs. But it worked and looked cute overall."
4.0,Survived one international trip but with minor holes. Can be used still but I expected it survive more trips without any damage.
4.0,Very pretty earrings.  Love how they catch and scatter the light.  They are nice quality and I like the lever back.  Wish they were a little larger though.
4.0,"She made me buy the larger size of the same suit for this summer. Small for size, but great otherwise."
4.0,"Wish it came with a belt.  It didn't look right letting the shirt just hang there.  So, I found a thing chain link belt that really made a difference in the way it fit."
4.0,It like fit bit strap very well made and.it very light weight when wearing it .
4.0,"Super cute, and quite nice for the price. Giving as a gift and feel confident it will be liked."
4.0,Its really nice but not want I re<br />ally wanted.
4.0,This was great for my son's birthday party. The football was small but we didn't buy it for the football. I would buy this again.
4.0,"To thick for normal wear, but will be good when the weather gets colder."
4.0,"Runs small, and the hood is a little floppy and awkward. But overall it's a nice warm jacket and for the price I think it's good."
4.0,"nice design, the material feels nothing like cotton though."
4.0,Tight on arms<br />But EVERYONE said it was cute on me.
4.0,They were a pain to get on and off but they did their job.
4.0,Liked it.. just what I wanted but afraid the letters will eventually come off since they are stickers. Like it for now.
4.0,"The bag fits everything I need it to: turnout pants, coat, boots, helmet, extra socks. There’s not much room for anything else, but that’s okay, it works for me.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is one of the zippers on the main compartment tore and slightly ripped the bag the first time I used it. Luckily it was at the end of the zipper, so it doesn’t affect much, it’s more annoying than anything.<br /><br />It’s a cheaper option for a good bag to move your turnout gear between home and station."
4.0,"Used as hospital bag for baby , i’ve already started packing ! If you use packing cubes you can make the most of it!"
4.0,"I received this yesterday and it looks just like the picture.  I love it!  However.......beware.  It came in a lovely black box with 2 pieces of string holding it in place.  So, I snipped 1, snipped the 2nd one, and it still was a little tough coming out. So, I snipped a 3rd one which turned out to be the adjustable part of the bracelet with the ball on it.  Not happy.  It can't be worn now. So, just be careful removing it from the box."
4.0,"cute bracelet , gave it to my daughter , at first it was to big to wrap around her wrist, then after she figured it out it was  adorable,  she can also use it as a necklace as well with the adjustable strap, really looks nice, I received this product discounted or free in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Love this bracelet. My daughter loved it. However, the charms are not put on very tight. I received it without one charm, but customer service was great and sent me the replacement wing. Bad thing is now the little heart fell off.  Just make sure to clamp the charms tightly so they don't lose it."
4.0,"Some reviews said it was oversized, but I don't think it is.  I think it's sort of true to size; I say ""sort of"" bc I find some oddities with the fit.  I find the shoulders a little wide in comparison to the chest width.  I find the material to be soft and comfortable, but it is not a very breathable fabric, which you notice in the heat of a Southern summer.  The breathability and the chest/bust width comparison combined to cause me to deduct one star.  The graphic is cute, but an iron on style."
4.0,"The only reason I am giving it a 4 not a 5 is because of how difficult it was to put in! I had a screw ring in before and that one was very easy to get in and out, but this one was difficult and took 3 people."
4.0,WIFE LOVES THESE.LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS
4.0,"These arrived really quickly, and I'm very happy with the quality! Some fit a little more loosely than others, but they all fit on at least on finger on my hands."
4.0,"I bought this because I had some extra cash, and I don't regret a thing! I just got them in today, and already obsessed with them! They go with almost everything, and I've only been out once with them and gotten several compliments! While they look super nice and expensive, the backing feels cheap. It feels like the earring are going to fall out any second. I fixed this with using some backing from another pair of earrings! Buy these!"
4.0,i love the color and it is very cool and helpful I wear it on weekends and people always ask me where I got it
4.0,"I ordered a size up and its a bit loose, still flattering and lovely."
4.0,this is a great shirt...but watch out for the sizes they run VERY BIG...xl is designed for a defensive lineman...but a great sweatshirt...
4.0,"Love these! So cute! Quite comfy, too."
4.0,"Love the size, fits my notebook perfectly. The zippers and handled could be a little more reinforced in place of fashion, but I love the feet on the bottom"
4.0,Good idea... Vegan.<br /><br />Left size card slots are super tight for me. Right side works fine. Just put the cards I don't use much on the left.
4.0,It broke where strap holes were. And it was uneven on bottom but it was a easy fix just glue it and it will stay together good.
4.0,"This dress is exactly like the photo with the exception of the length but I guess it depends on how tall you are. I love this dress, recommend it and look forward to wearing it in June."
4.0,"According to the measurements posted by the company, this should have fit. And when I put it on, I found the skirt just a tad short. Maybe that is me being a little more conservative than I used to be in my college days, but as a mom, I think if my skirt has the chance of flashing the kids on the playground...it is just a tad short.<br />But that aside.<br />This skirt seems to be well constructed. I found one long string but I think it was just not cut down after the garment was sewn. The pattern is fun and funky and would be perfect to showcase a fun personality. The material is somewhat rough, but I think that is expected given that it puckers normally. (It is a bubble skirt after all) The picture shown does make it seem that the skirt would come down to about mid calf, mine hardly covered the assets.<br />I received this skirt at a discount in exchange for a review. I have no particular interest in this company or in any person that works for them and so maintain that these opinions expressed above are mine and mine alone."
4.0,Tons of options  - great quality - enough to share!
4.0,"Cute ring, then getting a lot of use out of it the last couple weeks. Not incredibly made but you get what you pay for. I just ordered a second one to have in case this one breaks or wears out. I find with pieces just like this, the metal finish starts wearing off after several uses but this one hasn't yet"
4.0,"The included cord is kind of junk and very short but the key itself is great, which is what I was after. It is a lot thinner than I expected but that's not a problem and I happen to like the small size, it's about perfect for a necklace- not too flashy but big enough to tell what it is. It is a nice silver color with very little black in the etchings, which looks great. The inscriptions certainly pass as looking Dwarvish. All in all it's a fantastic little trinket for a LOTR/Hobbit fan."
4.0,It’s a little small. I have a hard time fitting my package into it.
4.0,"Love the material, haven't worn it to go out yet but when I tried it on it looked great... 😊"
4.0,"This is a cute dress. Flattering and comfortable - perfect for hot summer days. And it has pockets! But the ""model"" photos are definitely manipulated (ha! no surprise.) - My pockets start immediately under the drawstring ""waist"" detail, whereas the model photo shows her pockets about 4 inches below the drawstring. Something to keep in mind. Makes them a little less functional, in my opinion. But I'll still take a dress with pockets - functional or no."
4.0,These are really pretty. The one thing I don’t like about them is how the pin isn’t centered so sometimes it can make your earrings look uneven/like you have badly pierced ears.
4.0,Somewhat larger that I expected. The sleeves run a bit long (which is fine for a hoodie).<br />Taking one star away as the zipper area needs some improvement. It protrudes a bit around the stomach area.
4.0,"except for the hem unraveling a bit when it arrived, this item is super cute and comfy; my girls love it!"
4.0,"4 stars for a good use of this dance bag.  Perfect for preschoolers for their ballet and tap shoes, Not big enough for a pair of pants and shirt though.<br />The quality is ok but not the best, since the thread is already coming off. The zipper is still working after 6 months of use which is great! The color is great, it is exactly the same as what you see in the picture. Very please with this bag."
4.0,I love it but a little to long.
4.0,"Good headphones for canceling noise.  I bought them for my 4-year old with sensory issues, and he is happy to wear them but not for an extended period of time.  I do think they are a little stiff and somewhat tight, but I'm hoping over time they will be more flexible."
4.0,Good for the price but about 8-10 did not work.  Made a very popular stuffing for my 6 year olds piñata.
4.0,Really like this bracelet. Look very good on.
4.0,"It took WAY too long for these to arrive from China, but the product and price are actually decent.  They're a little thin, but for the price it isn't bad."
4.0,These work like a charm.  I was having issues with other shirt stays coming undone after an hour or so.  It was very annoying. I would have to go to the bathroom every 2 hours or so to reattach the strap.<br /><br />This shirt stay clasps at the bottom of the shirt and I have not had to readjust at all.
4.0,"Love the material, fits awesome, feels great, shows all the muscle separation,  expels heat nicely.  Only PROBLEM,  lots of uncut yarn everywhere.  Not sure how good it will hold up with use and in the washer...smh.<br />4 Stars out of 5"
4.0,"Bought this for my son. He is 5’ 10” 135lb. He is usually a medium, but we ordered a large because he wanted it to be a little baggy. The large ended up being what we normally would find in a medium fit. The material is a little thinner than I would expect a sweatshirt to be, but maybe that’s what “athletic” style means. Soft and strong material nonetheless. The color is a vibrant red orange. Will be good for fall, but maybe not winter."
4.0,The socks are very nice.  They are not for very cold days.  I like the patterns
4.0,They are pretty. The stone is pretty but small. The wires are thin. They are good for the price
4.0,So cute ! It feels like it’s made of a durable felt material. Really cute for our 6 month photos!
4.0,Decent lounge pant for the money. Pretty comfortable and will probably order another pair. A little long on my 5'5&#34; frame but a little gem and they're perfect.
4.0,"Nice dress, affordable"
4.0,The picture of product shows very bright blue. The ring inside appears closer to black in some lighting. Outside and with sunlight appears vibrant blue. Nice product and fiancée really likes it.
4.0,Don’t actually provide sun protection but top notch on cuteness factor for bachelorette pictures 😎😍🌴
4.0,"I use them for the gym. If you are looking for workout shorts, these are for you. They are not stylish. They are for the gym. I've had them for over a year and they are holding well."
4.0,"Dress is a little thin, shows lines of undergarments so a slip might be necessary. Sizing wise, I'm 5'6&#34; 115lbs, ordered a small and it fits perfectly. The fabric is stretchy so its not the least bit tight. The fabric feels silky too. It's a nice affordable dress."
4.0,Beware when ordering a size 9 it's 2xL 9 and they aren't WHITE!!!!!!
4.0,"It is a sturdy chain which will not easily break, I believe."
4.0,My grand daugther enjoyed them<br />Will order again
4.0,my second pair
4.0,Actually wanted the black but out of stock.  Went with blue....it’s a little too thick.
4.0,Great for what they're intended for. Easy to dry off and toss back into your gym bag.
4.0,Soft fabric. Nice lounging sleepwear dress.
4.0,Nice belt but it comes very large. So I have to make more holes. But thankfully it comes with an object to do that.
4.0,"I love the fit, and they're honestly super comfortable. But...they're see through on the behind. So sad. But still wearing them.."
4.0,The product is good as expeceted
4.0,"After 1 wash it has piled and changed texture. It's cute, oversized, but not worth the price for the quality."
4.0,its larger than i expected could double as a carry on or overnight bag
4.0,"I bought these for my wife on our aniversary along with several others and she loved it. The quality was great, but don't judge them until you have taken them out of the package. They shine beautifully."
4.0,"They do the job of light overall support. Could use a little more support across tummy and hips.  Because you are stretching the panty material putting it on , be careful you do not poke your nail through the material  My fault,  I was in a rush and not careful. Fit as expected"
4.0,"Nice quality belt, looks good, fits well, I would have liked it be slightly narrower"
4.0,great flips.  Thank you!
4.0,"true to color, lots of boob spillage"
4.0,normal para el precio
4.0,"Its nice necklace, pretty long for me since im petite but its a nice one."
4.0,Good quality.  Short wasted otherwise fit was good.
4.0,These glasses are pretty good. Come in a nice box with a little tool for fixing them. They are very light and feel a little flimsy but haven’t broken. They don’t cut the glare as much as I had hoped but do help some with night driving. We just moved to the country and are on 2 lane roads a lot at night. These have made me feel more comfortable driving at night but probably a nicer pair would work a bit better. Gave a pair to my sister as well and she loves them.
4.0,The sandals were delivered on time and nicely packaged. I took them out and put them on. They are very comfortable and fit perfectly. The color is exactly what I was looking for.
4.0,"I had previously bought the same type of mask in white and loved it. Decided to get the black ones for the gym or when I’m out doing groceries.  For some reason the fold by the nose on these keeps falling down. But I don’t have this issue with the whites ones. The styles are the same but I did purchase them from different sellers. Other than the nose part not staying up, over all no complaints on the masks."
4.0,Didn't last very long but for the price they were definately worth it!
4.0,Fit as expected.  Keep my feet warm. Good product.
4.0,Perfect for my cruise.
4.0,"I ordered 9.5-11 for my 5 years old. She wears 10- 10.5 on her regular shoes, But this runs little bigger then what I expected.<br />Actual item looks same as in photos. Very soft material."
4.0,One wash and already kind of looking ragged. Color is more orangey than the pretty coral in the picture.
4.0,Looks great. I only wish the holes were much bigger. You can only use a tiny thin scarf.
4.0,good fit . comfortable around the neck
4.0,"I like this belt very much...I should have ordered a smaller size....I can still wear it, a smaller size would have been better"
4.0,"I love these comfy pants. I got the size medium and they fit okay. Could have gotten away with a size small. The colors look just as pictured. I love the black and white. I am 5'6&#34; and 126 lbs. and I am wearing 2&#34; heels. The length is good with the heels. The inseam on size medium is 33&#34; for reference. Otherwise, they would be too long. The price was a bargain to."
4.0,"I bought this for my daughter for her middle school graduation. The dress is absolutely beautiful and the color is a very striking royal blue. BUT...for a “skater” style dress, it was too long. Because we loved the dress so much though, I paid almost twice as much as the price of the dress to have it tailored (at the waist) to an appropriate mini length. I wish they offered petite sizes. If you are slightly taller than average, and looking for a mini-dress, I would definitely recommend this dress—it’s really pretty."
4.0,Get a size 1-2 sizes bigger
4.0,These shorts are a perfect fit!
4.0,"This is a bit bulky,  and not really a dress.  More of a overcoat.  Fit is wide.  For reference I’m 5’1” 120lbs.  I wanted a slimmer fit.  Cute over an outfit felt like a coat. Not a dress."
4.0,It was a gift for my wife.  Unfortunately it was too large and too long so we had to return it.
4.0,"I love how this dress fits!  I was a little worried it might be too short, because I am 5'9&#34;.  It isn't!  The only thing that i was a little bit disappointed on was that the lace had frayed ends, but those are easily fixable!"
4.0,These are actually really nice I would just maybe a lot better if they were just a little bit bigger I thought it would come further down on my forehead other than that they were great
4.0,I def like that you can adjust what ever size you want. and they look so real. i love to wear my pearls.
4.0,This is thin but that lightness makes this easy to drape.  Long enough for multiple wraps around neck area without being all bulked up.  Very soft but I wouldn't say it feels like cashmere.  The edges are not hemmed..just feathered out.  Goes w/everything and looks great
4.0,"My knit fabric dress is backless and this is just what I needed to lift my boobs and smooth my pooch! I read the other reviews and ordered down 1 size. I wear a 38D bra and size 10-12 dress and ordered the 36D. I fits pretty good. I put my dress on over it and it did smooth out my lower pooch just enough to fool the eye. Now, it isn't the super stretch material you get with Spanx, but it does the job. And, I don't have to wrestle with the self-adhesive bra since this covers the breasts, too! Excuse the lumps, but I thought somebody might appreciate seeing this thing on!"
4.0,These protect my shirt but not my pants. Great value for the price but I wanted longer.  I'd get them again if they were the only reasonably priced option.
4.0,I like that there are so many pockets and that it zippers closed across the top. Also came with a changing pad!
4.0,"These socks are wonderful. The non skid bubbles have good traction, the price is reasknable, the colors are cute and they are comfortable.<br />The only reason they were not 5 star is the strings that tie are way to long."
4.0,"Looks great see good,fits great."
4.0,"Shorts arrived on time, great value."
4.0,Really pretty. Material is comfortable
4.0,"Nice material, pretty<br />Run small"
4.0,"These are great for long haired naturally curly girls who need to keep their hair away from our faces stylishly. They're a polyester blend, light weight and pretty long. My hair is past my shoulders and it keeps it mostly hidden. It also works for my weave wearing sisters who need to cover up the front part of their hair when it's time to get a retouch. Great price too."
4.0,"Easy to put on, soft cotton, wash ,dry no problem and very comfortable"
4.0,"I have a variety of brands and try to use shoes for specific purposes after a trial period. I now use these shoes when biking or on short hikes. The Teva soles give too much feedback from sharp surfaces to my personal liking. I’d recommend using heavier socks if using these for serious hiking. They are incredibly light and waterproof. The upper surface, behind toes, creases when walking and this is not the ideal experience. Overall, these are fine for the uses I put them to."
4.0,Skirt worked great for my needs.  Was wide enough to accommodate a bustle. Best of all it has deep side pockets.
4.0,Great product and would buy it again.
4.0,They are a bit snug but not uncomfortable. Very warm and stylish.
4.0,They can clip onto pretty much anything and are super bright. Also like how their position can be adjusted. I hook them onto my baby carrier when I'm walking with my daughter at might so they help me see and be seen! Just wish the battery life lasted longer but they're easy to charge.
4.0,Product is received as promise
4.0,She loved it<br />But expensive.  After I bought this one I saw the same thing at Wal-greens for $13..
4.0,"These are really warm to wear. I take a 40 minute walk through cold weather and, just recently, a snowstorm. Pants haven't gotten wet from snow going past my knees, and my lower half is now warmer than having a hoodie and a coat on for the top half.<br />Bad part is in its breathability. While I'm dry from snow, sweat is retained pretty heavily; expect swampy pockets. Chest pocket is pretty nice though, and doesn't get nearly as swampy.<br />Overall: pretty good, but you're getti g what you paid for."
4.0,Fits well.  I always go two sizes bigger
4.0,These replaced a set that mom lost an earring from and are nicer than what she lost. The one on top is the remaining old earring and the two below are the new ones. Mom is happy.
4.0,"I've had the band a few months now, and it's holding up pretty well. The dges are fraying a bit, but that seems to be the fabric of the band getting caught in my various tools at work (which as a klutz, is bound to happen to me), but it seems to be holding its own and still looks nice.<br /><br />It's a little harder to clean the band than the last metal one I had because I could clean that one with a sprayer and alcohol, but this one is more of a ""wash and let dry"" sort of deal. It is still cleanable, just not as easily.<br /><br />I like my accessories to be cute as well, and the navy blue is subtle and looks great with most of my outfits. Closeup, the knit on the band is kind of weird looking, but that creates a soft and comfortable feel against my wrist, and few people are studying my wristband at close quarters.. For the price, definitely a win!"
4.0,"First of all this dress is beautiful and I absolutely love it. It fits well and is super soft. My one complaint is that there is no care instructions. I turned that dress inside out looking for the care instruction tag and there wasn’t one. Since I don’t know what material it’s made out of I don’t know if it’s dryer safe, what temp to put the iron on, and all that good stuff. Other than that I’m completely pleased with this product."
4.0,"Todo, me gusto como me quedo."
4.0,"It's okay, I would probably buy this again. You can use this for as long as you want but keep the wrapper that came with the push up bra."
4.0,Ordered this product for my daughter and she loves them.  Good quality and seem to be will made.  This product is shipped from over seas and arrived ten days early from this particular seller which was a pleasant surprise.  I would definitely order from this seller again and I highly recommend.
4.0,This is somewhat humbling to say but I simply cannot fill this bag up.  I don't consider myself as small but I'm not large either.  I was hoping for a snug fit around my twig and berries. The draw string permits the bag to be tightened around the base of the penis and scrotum and this is very well made of quality materials.
4.0,Not the fabric I was expecting but still fits and looks nice
4.0,"I ordered this bracelet because I love the infinity symbol and its meaning.  It is a rather delicate/dainty bracelet and it is beautiful.  Because of its delicacy, I do not wear it often.  Still, it's worth is value.  Anyone receiving this as a gift would love it."
4.0,This is great stylish coat but slightly heavy.  The sleeves  are very light material but thats what makes the look great.  the check portion is  on heavier side though so it didnt work for me as a light jacket  and due to sleeves not work as heavy coat - but the look is great.
4.0,Material feels amazing.  Love the fit and pockets.
4.0,I didn't love the color of the buttons but  I just changed the buttons!! I love the sweater!!
4.0,Nice bracelet for the price paid :)
4.0,"I've been buying this brand online from amazon for a while now, however, you must be careful who you buy them from! There are a lot of knock offs on amazon!"
4.0,Tight and n the arms. Had to tear to accommodate.
4.0,"Since masks are forced for shopping and I struggle severely with not being able to breathe in regular masks,I decided to try a chiffon mask. I went for this one because it could get here fast. Bottom line, I can breathe in this, still not as well as I want to though. But that would go for anything over my nose. It is comfortable and the ties around the neck work ok but should be longer or have something attached to them to make it easier. I think I will go with the suggestion of using velcro strips. I am a moderately overweight gal and when tied it seemed a bit snug around my neck and I wouldn't want to wear it that way for a long time. This will at least get me in the door of places though I highly doubt it actually helps stop the spread of the virus. But that doesn't bother me as I am in a really low count area where it hasn't really hit us at all."
4.0,This is a nice box and packaging that it came in. It is painted nicely with no stray color outside the lines.It makes a good gift for someone who is a first  time jeep owner/driver
4.0,"Nice print, fits well but the shirt material could have been better quality."
4.0,"I loved the costume, but the one size fits all is if you are medium or smaller build.  The girl in the photo must be 100lbs and 5ft."
4.0,"I love the pockets and the dress. The only downside is that the fabric is too thin on top, so I do have to wear an under tank with them. But, the fabric has a nice stretch, and I find the dresses very comfortable. Also, the pockets have held up to significant use."
4.0,They are exactly like the picture. Fits greats and comfortable.
4.0,great but chain a little short for me.
4.0,"Doesn't have those gawdawful tags in the back that chafe when you wear them, nor does the waist slide down overmuch.  Still waiting the perfect compression shorts that don't do that at all."
4.0,"Super cute, kinda big. I can usually buy a medium and be comfortable, definitely should have got a small instead."
4.0,"This hoodie is really good quality. I just ordered it for my sister for Christmas. The only thing is the one I got is black, not chocolate brown like the description says. I'm not concerned enough about it to return it but just a heads up to other buyers."
4.0,Morning walks on cold days. Item is fine for my use.
4.0,A hit at my party! Kinda hard to put on though.
4.0,"Simply, shapely and versitle.  A bit cheep but still OK because it looks good on me.  I have to shorten it for me but if you are 5""4 it will be just right for about 3 inches above the knee."
4.0,"The color is off, the coffee brown have a little red in them so they look almost mauve"
4.0,I'm 5'4. 132lbs. I love the dress. I didnt like that i was expecting more or a emerald green dress (as i thought shown on the website) and it looks more blueish green in person. The zipper wasn't attached fully to the dress but I was able to fix it.
4.0,Its cute and fits ok...but would probably liked it a bit looser in the sholders and around the biceps.
4.0,"The sweater is lovely--it's like someone made a knitted throw into the perfect cardigan.  It can be worn on a cool summer night or chilly winter day.  I really love it, and I will order more.  I did not leave 5 stars due to the some threads coming out of the sweater (I burned them off).  I hope the sweater holds up because it really is lovely. I am 5'4 1/2, slim, and I ordered a small."
4.0,"I love the concept, the layout of the straps isn't the best for my miscellaneous stuff. I end up with a gap in the middle that I have a hard time finding the right size things for. Otherwise love the product"
4.0,I have never had cufflings before these will be my first.  They are really cute and adorable to me I am looking forward to wearing them with my clothes.
4.0,Is  a nice shirt
4.0,Colors are 👍
4.0,They look nice but the material is a little stiff and color faded with 1 wash. But good for the price!  They sent me a replacement product that i received right away and it was great! Looked great and perfect fit
4.0,Love the shirt but it is very tight in the bust. I usually wear a size large and I ordered an extra extra large due to reviews. Still fits like a medium. Wish it fit decently cuz it is adorable
4.0,Seems to be correct size but the are a gift that has not been given yet. Wish they were available in up to the knee size
4.0,"Very pleased with my purchase. I was hesitant to order clothing without being able to see it & try it on, but I was very happy & surprised with the dress. It's dressy & yet casual!!"
4.0,have one in all neutral colors to cinch long sweaters. Also keeps jeggings with belt loops up around waist. Glue around &#34;leather&#34; area but not noticeable.
4.0,Nice quality but runs small.
4.0,The feel and look is absolutely perfect. I have two: this green one and the black one. The difference: the green one has sleeves that can't expand so I feel claustrophobic in my sweater. Not a big deal but I have worn the black a tad more often.<br /><br />Word of warning however for all colors: the pocket in front doesn't slant inward so putting your phone in the pocket does not mean it'll stay in place. I have jeans pockets so it doesn't bother me too much but just so future buyers know keep this in mind.
4.0,glamorousss
4.0,Cute shirt. Fabric is a little hard! But what I was looking for as style! Fast shipper
4.0,I just ordered this on the 16th & received it today shipping was fast. It's just like the picture really pretty my only problem is the bar was crooked. Really easy to fix though I just bent it back to place myself & it looks like that problem never even existed. I haven't worn it yet so I don't know exactly how long it'll last or how well made it is.
4.0,Way better quality ten I expected it was so inexpensive really pretty
4.0,This was brought as a Christmas gift so for now  have to say it fit as expected.
4.0,They are cute. They are very flimsy but that's to be expected for such a low price. Look good on me. I've gotten lots of compliments on them.
4.0,A big large but lovely style
4.0,It has good material. I bought for my friend’s daughter christmas gift. She love it .<br />She use her dance class and go to some travel.<br />I would like recommend who like ballet bag .
4.0,"The fit is as expected, although the elastic in the leg openings is slightly looser than I think it should be."
4.0,The coat seems short for a rain coat and sleeves are long. But it's a cute print and nice and lightweight
4.0,"Beautiful product, however it feels extremely light and fragile. I can see this falling apart relatively soon."
4.0,"Happy with my purchase slightly big at the sides, but overall I'm happy."
4.0,"I’m 5’4 140 lbs, ordered a medium. Fit well but the bottom is a little short but nothing you can’t work with, if I would’ve gotten the large it would’ve been to long. Good bodysuit overall"
4.0,Very nice jacket. Close fit.
4.0,"The colors were definitely way different than in the picture but it’s still nice. Fits really well. You can see through the top part though, much like you can see through  basically any white tee. Glad I had $10 off cuz I would not have really been that pleased if I actually paid the full price but I’m very pleased with it for only $8 and some change. Lol."
4.0,fit was just a little big but not enough for my daughter to not wear it
4.0,very durable material
4.0,No era para mi era para un sobrino que me lo pidió
4.0,"Bought these 4 shirts because they’re light and cooling on hot days. The first one I wore snagged without really doing anything that should snag it. Then it snagged even more running through the wash.<br />The other 3 I am trying to be gentle with so they don’t get snags in them, but actually I only bought them to relax in around the house so snags or not, they’re fine for the price."
4.0,"The center pendant looks like real abalone. The sea life on the pendant is rendered well. All the necklace is very artistic and lovely. The earrings are resin mimic. But I could see that when I enlarged the image before buying. Very worth it, as it is made well, looks great, hangs nicely, fits comfortably all day, and has easy on easy off clasp. Love this necklace."
4.0,The T-Shirt is a decent quality it’s not too thin.
4.0,"Absolutely loved these shorts, they fit sooo well and we're so comfy unfortunately they got a hole fairly quick."
4.0,Very soft in the forehead and overall. I gave it 4 because it’s a little tight for me and no other sizes...but I have a larger head and thick hair so it’s expected.  I cut into the rear of the hat and cut some of the elastic out...much better now.
4.0,I had it for while but then it started to peel and the leather broke so I would not buy this again but it is really cute to look at.
4.0,These Kids sized sweatbands are perfect.
4.0,This shirt looked so nice when we got it in. It was much nicer than we expected.
4.0,Love it. Haven't washed it yet so we'll see if it shrinks. Only thing (if I was being overly critical) I wish the logo and letters were a liiiittle bit bigger
4.0,"Great fit, cup size accurate to size."
4.0,Very pretty white dress. Fit me well - I’m pear shaped and 5’2”. The skirt is very see-through so I had to wear a slip. But very lovely on.
4.0,The stones are small and falling out.
4.0,"Great, but too tight."
4.0,Was a little wrinkly when I got it and there's extra fabric that keeps popping out by the V line neck area which is annoying. It's comfy and glad I went with a Medium. I am 5'2&#34; with 34B bust it fits me perfectly I recommend you guys go a size up from what you would be! Can't wait to wear this to school and out in the spring and summer !
4.0,Bag is beautiful.  It is supple leather.  Two compartments with side zippers.
4.0,It is too thin.
4.0,Everyone loved the shirt. Was great fir a casual Christmas Eve party. Sleeves and length run longer than expected though.
4.0,Love the top but not crazy about the material
4.0,Great quality but unfortunately run a bit small
4.0,"Fits well, my kids love these & they last a while. Once they’ve been washed a handful of times, some of them fade and pill up,<br />but otherwise they are cool."
4.0,"My husband loved it...  It is a litle tight on him, size-wise... but he is in the process of losing weight, so hopefully it  will fit better ..."
4.0,I love these!! I got them for my penpals to send as a small gift every now and then. The only reason for the 4 stars is because when they bend to much they stretch and rip. And the white get very dirty and fast. You can not clean it off. Being the rubber is different.
4.0,It’s a very beautiful and simple design with a comfortable weight to it. Great quality.
4.0,Came and was really nice looking but the small ran huge!  Also had a chemical / wet dog smell to it
4.0,"I have small wrists (it's one of the ONLY small things on me - lol).  This watch band is perfect for me.  It's pretty and doesn't look humungous and masculine on me like some of the wide bands do.  I bought the black/gray flowered band.  The ONLY issue I have with it is that, after wearing it for a month or so, every day, the outer layer started peeling off.  It looks like the print, itself, is still there.  But, there's some sort of coating peeling off of the outside of it.  Only I can see it, to be honest.  Nobody else can see it.  But, that's a flaw, nonetheless.  I'm taking 1 star off for that.  But, overall, I love this band for my Sense."
4.0,The colors are fun but I just think the quality of these socks has declined. I make sock monkeys and the modern ones are just not as durable... thinner and less elasticity ... sigh.
4.0,good wallet. holds money and cards and stuff.
4.0,"My brother ordered this for me for Christmas.  It's a great price but the pearls fell out immediately.  I hadn't even removed it from the packaging.  For the price, I wasn't super concerned about it but I'd you're expecting to wear it looking like this, make sure you open it carefully so the pearls don't get lost and then super glue them into the bangle."
4.0,It's a cute shoe..it fits my baby very well and look so cute...
4.0,These are ADORABLE!!!
4.0,"Im 140, 36C and bought a large. Fits nicely, soft material. My only suggestion is to wash it alone, on delicate and line dry. Not sure how well the letters will hold up."
4.0,Is a very nice bag
4.0,Great product.  Was a gift for someone else but I love it.
4.0,Nice design.  Really like the music theme.
4.0,"Unique design, and Patsy's nickname is Moma Dog due to our 2 Pekingese. She was touched by it. Very reasonably priced.  Just wished &#34;Dog Mom&#34; was larger, needed a magnifying glass to confirm it was there, But it was my favorite design found."
4.0,The turquoise stone looks less like turquoise and more like blue plastic than what is pictured.
4.0,"i loved the color,quality medium."
4.0,"The Jean's were a little too short, other wise a great looking Jean"
4.0,little bit long in the arms
4.0,it fits good but don't like how tight it get around the neck
4.0,"The earring are a nice size, but the Kitty face is kind of small and off center. My neice liked them anyway, but they were not exactly what I was expecting."
4.0,"Now let be very clear these are 4 star shorts based on the price. They are not on par with other high brand name workout shorts however, for the price they are great! They function just fine for a high intensity workout. They move wel for squats, lunges, KB swings, etc. just wished they cinched tighter around the waist. Don’t expect Lululemon quality on poor man brand budget but they are definitely worth $19 bucks."
4.0,"Wore it on vacation in Hawaii, tied it in back. Light and comfy."
4.0,Don't care for exterior stitching.
4.0,Just a bit of a problem with a gap along the buttons at the bustline.
4.0,Good and wuick
4.0,"I have multiple pairs of Clark's shoes. These seemed quite narrow in comparison to the other pairs I own. A couple of days with the shoe stretchers and they were fine. They look great, and I'm sure as they get broken in they will be comfortable enough."
4.0,These headbands were made well but just a bit too stretchy for what I needed to use them for.
4.0,It’s very soft and great looking. Runs a bit on the larger side.
4.0,Didn't know they would be so dark. The image appears to have a lighter colored lens that I hoped for/needed.
4.0,I really like this dress/coverup the fabric is polyester Jersey I wish it were cotton. That’s my only complaint. I’m 5’3” and 145-150 and it fits great had I been bigger it would lean towards bodycon because of the stretchy fabric. It’s going to be perfect for Mexico!
4.0,Haven't had this long.  Purchased as a gift for my husband.  Good sound quality. Comfortable fit.  Easy instructions.  Will buy more.
4.0,"It's cute and fun, the fit runs small, make sure to size up!"
4.0,shirt is cute and nice material .wish it was a little longer . daughter is 5'5 and xl comes right below  her waist
4.0,My granddaughter really like this and kept her quite warm.  Perfect size for a 7 year old.
4.0,Comfortable to wear. A little hard to get on vet your hand to put watch on but it will go on
4.0,This watch is very nice and works very good.
4.0,They works fine for me
4.0,Fit as expected .
4.0,"Sizing was pretty accurate. Super soft and warm but not too heavy. I like every thing except the hood ties, they look kinda cheap and the color stands out too much from the rest of the jacket, it was almost like an afterthought or like &#34; we have too much of this bright white rope thingy sir&#34;, &#34;ok use it on all hoodies then, you get a rope, she gets a rope, they all get a white cheap rope!&#34; But I nitpick, its cute, the rope thing doesnt keep me up at night, I still wear it a lot and get a lot of compliments on it!"
4.0,"like the looks, quality, and the color."
4.0,its nice top true to chart size price is good
4.0,"So super pretty, even prettier than it looks online, but the chain is already tarnishing... :-("
4.0,Too small but I will give it to somebody.
4.0,The belt is really cute. Thought it was going to be a little wider but I still like it and have worn it over tunic tops a few times.
4.0,Wifey Likey!
4.0,"Very pretty but the flat back is extremely small. I bought 3 so I’m able to use one for my helix, nose and Labret."
4.0,"Love the purse and the design. Has plenty of room and pockets on the inside as well as the holster pocket on the outside for a full size hand gun. Seems well made. Only complaint would be the straps... purse is too large for the long body strap and the 2 shoulder straps are way too short (I measured them at 18&#34;) to easily carry on the shoulder. I will be purchasing new straps to comfortably carry the purse, but it is worth replacing the straps in order to keep it."
4.0,"The product seems well built, although for their cost, they should be.  There definitely could be more cushioning on the sole.  The &#34;bottle openers&#34; sometimes get in the way when walking up and down stairs.  The metal component is making marks on my oak staircase."
4.0,Cute and comfortable. The straps were easy to pull down/off if you're laying out to tan; the suit looked great by itself or under a wrap and could easily be paired with heels for a retro look or flip flops for easy walking from pool/beach to house.
4.0,"Nice soft fabric, but a little thin and clingy!"
4.0,"It works, Looks good, not sure how long, but my wife likes the looks, although it is pretty heavy for her."
4.0,These fit generous. The 3-4t (size tag 110) fits like a 4t so too large for my 3 year old. The size 100 fits her perfect. So size down if you are in between sizes. She is 3’2 and 33lbs.<br /><br />They are a comfortable soft knit dress. And have a little twirl. The red stripes on the side seams don’t match up perfectly but I didn’t think they were going to be exceptional quality for the price. There are also a few strings hanging that needed to be trimmed off.<br />We go to the lake for the 4th every year so these are great 4th of July holiday dress that I won’t be worried about ruining.<br />I think for the price and our needs they are great!
4.0,"I was under the impression that these bags were Vira Bradley bags, so when I received them I was very disappointed."
4.0,Godd cualitaty for the priceˋˋ
4.0,"Comfortable, but is too clingy."
4.0,Chain broke off on first use.
4.0,I like the dress.
4.0,Wished they were just a half-inch bigger.
4.0,Awesome photo and fun puzzle my 10 year old and I put together in about 3 days.  some  of the pieces were not cut precisely making it a bit difficult to put together but other than that great product
4.0,"Decent shirt, turns a lot of heads, shirt has some stretching ability to it."
4.0,"The top came quickly and was exactly what I ordered. It is printed well, and feels nice. Didn't smell weird or anything. However it is very cropped as I expected. I am a 16/18 and 38DD and it goes right under the breast. It is cute, and fits me but if it was one or two inches longer it would have been 10/10 for me."
4.0,"Didn't wash so far, can't tell about after wash if will keep the same. Fits as Large."
4.0,"These are cheaply made, as expected for the price. They fit as expected and look super cute!"
4.0,I have bought a lot of expensive wigs for multiple cosplays. This was my first cheap wig and I was really suprised at the great quality. I give this four stars only because it does shed (Only a little) and parting the bangs isn't easy.
4.0,"My only complaint is that one pair of leggings arrived with a giant hole in the waistband... I'm guessing someone else ripped them and returned them.<br /><br />However, the leggings that are not ripped are fantastic! Really comfortable, the waistband sits high at my natural waist and does not dig in. They are super soft and flattering. I would purchase these again despite receiving a ripped pair."
4.0,These are good to wear under a dress.  Not necessarily to wear by themselves cause they are a little see through.  Material is thin.  Runs a little on the small size.  Probably just go one size up
4.0,"I love that the waist band is like you are wearing compression leggings, but with breezy shorts. I am 5'5 122 pounds, petite athletic build and carry most of my weight in my lower half. I ordered the small. High quality fabric and heavenly!"
4.0,"It is a print not a miniature clock. Even though it is not as pictured, it is still unique and appealing so not returning."
4.0,The cup size is way too small but the back strap fits right. I'm still going to keep it even though my nipples are falling out. 😅Hah.<br />It's sexy! The material is good quality as well. I like it!
4.0,"The pants do look and feel good. My only issue with them is that they are very large. Based on the reviews, I ordered a smaller size for my boy, but still they are big on him."
4.0,Cute and comfy but seems a tad small
4.0,The chokers arrived in time. They look good even though they run a little big. They are adjustable but not as much as I would've liked. Regardless of this they are nice and i wear them all the time.
4.0,She liked it!
4.0,"Very pretty but extremely long and the yellow is a sunshine bright bright yellow, not as muted as the picture"
4.0,"It is hard to find a snap-front robe.  The snaps are great - not hard to come apart at all.  Length comes about 3"" above my ankles.  I am 5'4"".  Perfect medium size on me. I love the color.  It washes well.  I do wish the fabric was a little softer, however.  Overall, a good buy."
4.0,I decided to get the air baby insoles. They are made by HeelBorne. Here's what I think about them.<br /><br />* One pair of lift insoles<br />* One additional pair of additional height  lights<br />* foam construction with gel air capsules<br />* soft felt cover<br /><br />Just to clarify these are height lifting insoles. The total height that you can obtain is 2 inches. I have just been using the base insole. I am 5 foot three on a really good hair day. I decided I would try these. I am surprised and how much I like them. I didn't grow 3 inches overnight. I just use these lifts to help me subtly get a fraction taller. No one around me has really noticed. I definitely do notice. It quietly makes me more confident.<br /><br />They are well constructed. The phone seems like is very durable. I like that you get the choice of adding additional height. These fit well in my shoes and are comfortable to wear. I don't feel like my feeder stuffed in my shoes because these might be too big.<br /><br />I decided that I really like these. They truly are a little treat for myself that no one knows about. If it makes me feel confident.  It didn't cost much money. It  is not bothering anyone else. I definitely recommend this for everyone interested. They are worth the money.<br /><br />I purchased these at a discount or was given them complementary in exchange for my honest unbiased review. All of the opinions expressed here are solely my own.
4.0,"I guess for the price it is, I got what I paid for. But even then I didn't expect the product to come defective. 2 out of the 4 cases were in perfect condition, but the other 2 were less then ideal. the dark brownish one I have in the 2nd picture (the bottom right one) you can tell that it doesn't close properly, there's still a gap. And in the same one, when you look on the bottom there's a big dent on it, which is why it wont close.<br /><br />The cream/off-white colored one is almost perfect, except when you open it, on the inside you can see the top right of the inside, the material is loose. In the 5th picture, you can see that i can pull it down bc its not glued on properly. And in that last picture, its kind-of hard to tell, but there's a small gap when you close it. It's not too noticeable though, unlike the brown one.<br /><br />Overall, it doesn't bother me too much, but im disappointed in the brown one.<br />The reason why I didnt rate a 3/5 would be because the little baggies I got from this purchase was decent and good condition."
4.0,"Used for a photoshoot, luckily I was okay with the sheerness of it, but beware anyone looking for a thick, opaque cape."
4.0,"Very good, thanks,,,"
4.0,Lace does not in the back.
4.0,"Beautiful, but a but fit little snug"
4.0,"My son loves these socks for playing outside in the winter, but they run small (even if you hang dry them). I would definitely buy this brand again but in a larger size next time. (I would give them a 4.5 if that were possible.)"
4.0,"Super cute. Love the colors and fit. The rainbow colors are beautiful..fits my vintage style. However did get called a lesbo for wasting it, but I'll just take it as a compliment."
4.0,Good wallet for the money
4.0,I ordered the XXL for the bibs.  The bibs fit well; (6' 2'' 265#s) I have long legs with an average torso.  The shoulder straps were snug at first but fit well while riding.  The jersey was extremely small and the pattern is an odd match for the bibs (however the Tenn Mens Coolflo Breathable Short Sleeve Cycling Jersey by Tenn-Outdoors 4X yellow was a perfect fit and match).  If the bibs were available in another color; I would definitely order another pair.
4.0,"Nice quality with embroidered detail that was accurate!  Can also double as a stole, & the cover will allow to be portable & kept clean"
4.0,"This sweatshirt is so soft!!!! Love the color (I ordered navy). I usually wear a medium in shirts but for sweatshirts I like them. Little bigger and usually worry the sleeves are going to be too short, and they are even when I sized up to a large."
4.0,"My husband can no longer wear his metal wedding band when he's at work but he has put this ring on and hasn't taken it off, nothing to complain about here."
4.0,It was very pretty and blingey. I wanted to wear it with my red lace v neck cocktail dress. It was too much for that outfit. It was a very nice set for a dressy occasion or wedding.
4.0,The extra large fit just right
4.0,Worked for me.
4.0,"I love using this for my numerous cords and chargers when I travel. I was able to fit my iPhone 5 charger, Dell PC charger, 2 juice packs, 2 mini USB cords, and a couple of pens on this thing easily. It even has a pocket in the back to fit important (or not) documents or papers, which was a surprise to me but was super helpful. If I was rating this on the concept alone, it would get 5 stars because I just think it's super genius. My only complaint is that it has a hard time keeping some of the larger or heavier pieces in place, which isn't the end of the world, but I would guess it would have a hard time if you're looking to solely keep laptop chargers on this thing because it would get a bit heavy. But overall, love it."
4.0,"Very nice dress.  Fabric is soft, and of good quality.  I'm not thrilled with the belt loop placement or size (they seem to stick off the dress about 2 inches & are not on the mid-seam, but closer to the front) but I can deal with that!  Good value!"
4.0,"So many modern jeans don't come up to the waist - which I find very uncomfortable.  These fit fine, coming right to my waist.  The pants could be a half inch smaller around the waist, but I can live with it.  The belt loops are wide enough that I can wear any of my belts, which I appreciate.  These Jeans have a little elasticity, and the fabric is lighter than denim which is nice going into warmer weather.  The jeans are traditional five pocket.  I use my pockets and need them.  I did take of a star because the pockets are shallow.  That is a common flaw in women's clothing.  I seek out Gloria Vanderbilt pants because they are the brand that fits me best and are well made."
4.0,"Cute pattern and warm but fit too large. I gave it to my mom. I’m 5’9 and 165, curvy, and ordered a large."
4.0,Good quality and comfortable. One minus was it was larger than expected but still will keep
4.0,"Nice fit, flattering"
4.0,"Very comfortable and soft ! Only thing is, I was expecting a gray, not a blueish color. Still pretty though!"
4.0,They're OK I don't think they are the best wool socks out there as advertised.  I like the ones from rei much better.  I don't think they're worth almost $22 a pair.
4.0,"Just came on time, perfect to match for my Halloween pocahontas costume."
4.0,"I honestly love this shirt, it fits and looks adorable. It is very lightweight and the neckline is a little funny at the shoulders, but that didn't stop me from ordering it in 2 more colors."
4.0,I like this a lot but the bottoms are a little big. Maybe that’s good for some people. Other than that very nice. I ordered an extra large and I am 5’3” and 160lbs and it’s big on me. So maybe a size down.
4.0,I was awesome but there was a little hole but i could just stitch it up where you cant see it. and the material was morr flimsy then i thought it would be.
4.0,They seem like good quality but are tight around the waist
4.0,"It is a cute dress &amp; loose. Great for days you don't want to suck it in. The dress Run Large, so order a smaller size. I wear a Medium &amp; I ordered a Small. It looks cute with a belt. It is lined. I think this dress is best  for women with smaller chests."
4.0,"I like this dress. I bought it to wear on Thanksgiving and it was a great ""eating dress."" Alsom I am 6 months pregnant and I receive lots of compliments on it, but am certain it will look cute even after the baby comes. The fabric is a little thin, but it looks brand new after one wash, so I'm still enjoying it."
4.0,"If I didn't need a UPF hat for my water aerobics classes, I would have returned this because I have a smallish head and this runs large. I just roll up the brim and it works for me. However, I wouldn't order another one."
4.0,Very pretty...my 14 year old daughter loves it. The packaging is so pretty that she almost didn't want to take it out.
4.0,comfortable and sturdy
4.0,Kind of bulky but they really cute. Can't type small words but you can answer your phone which is what I needed.
4.0,"Good cotton, very nice"
4.0,"The wig was in good condition although it was a little curlier than I expected it to be, It looked natural. There were a lot of people who thought I just changed my hairdo."
4.0,"everyday wear, exercise, nightwear"
4.0,Love em I wear them all the time. Great buy
4.0,very comfortable but I should pick a larger size
4.0,"I love them but I would suggest wearing the the backs on them. I wore them for Easter and they kept slipping out but other than that they are very lovely and delicate, just perfect."
4.0,"I love Keen's stuff so when my old flip-flops were going quick I thought I'd give these a try. At first I wasn't that crazy about them. but by the third day they've come around nicely. The only thing is they seem like they might not last as long as my other Keen sandals and boots, but that is yet to be determined. The fit is just slightly on the small size for me."
4.0,I like the product because it’s a small purse I can carry in the book bag for work I love the color goes with everything .
4.0,"Nice bra, Nothing fancy , just a nice bra"
4.0,"For the price, this really exceeded my expectations. It actually seems like it will hold up well and the metal is a decent weight. The hole for the scarf is really very small, though - none of the scarves I own fit through it. I'm hoping I can fit a thin cotton or chiffon scarf through it, but I'm not terribly confident - if you're hoping to use it with even a mid weight cotton scarf, this isn't the product for you! I'll update if I'm able to find something that works. Either way, it looks way nicer than I expected and I'll find some way to use it."
4.0,Nice earrings.  Good for Thanksgiving and other times when pie is served
4.0,"The shirt is comfortable and the message comes across clearly. People either shake their head when they read it, or stop me to ask about it. I even had one person tell me they were very offended by the shirt's message (perhaps they are a math hater, IDK? LOL)"
4.0,Great product and was delivered as advertised.  Thanks!
4.0,Its cute but a little small.
4.0,I expected a raincoat but I did not expect it to cling to me and cause me to sweat when I wear it.  Another item going into the closet never to be worn again.  Sigh.
4.0,"It's a bit too high on my head for my taste, and it's too large. I should have known better since a man is modeling it. Sometimes I take chances. Other than that, it's a decent hat!"
4.0,This has been the best scarf ever. It’s very very warm and soft. The only thing that kinda stinks is that the fabric does get caught easily on things so I have a few loose strings already (I’ve worn it maybe 5 times) I would def buy again though and just be more careful
4.0,"My scarf arrived in good condition and I am pleased with it,  However, the package, which was a simple  unsealed zip-lock bag, had a notation on  the outside to the effect that ""This product shipped in its original bag to reduce packaging."""
4.0,This dress is so cute and comfortable. The only reason I am giving it a 4 is because the sizing is way off. This dress is way too large.
4.0,Beautiful ring. Nice comfort will order more from the company
4.0,I read some comments about buying a size up. Rubbish. This fits me perfect. I love it
4.0,This is a cute dress. The pattern is really unique. My husband really liked me in it. I would say that if you don't care about your dress being see thru then you don't have to wear a slip. I wore a half slip with the dress because I wore it to work which was a bit of a mistake because when you sit down the dress opens up due to wear the split is. I didn't think my thighs would be so out. The fabric isn't very breathable so I wouldn't recommend wearing it out in the heat/humidity all day. It was fairly easy to iron but the fabric isn't soft.  I am 5'7&#34; and the dress hit about 3 inches above my ankles.
4.0,Nice product for the Price
4.0,"Would make a good cape, but as a wrap around not big enough, made work by usage of petticoats. Color and design great."
4.0,"This is well made and very pretty, its quite big so I won't probably wear it but will put it in my collection."
4.0,"Fit well. Fairly thing material. I would only consider these to be a base layer instead of strict runners. Pretty skin tight and revealing, but if you into that, hey why not. Give em a shot. Im happy with this product"
4.0,"I really like the cuff links, the only reason I rated them a 4 is because the black part is actually more of a dark green.  Otherwise I am very happy with them."
4.0,"I LOVE THIS but unfortunately it’s way too small!  I’m 5’1,  110-115lbs, & curvy.  I am the shortest person I know.. and this shirt is short it practically gave me an atomic wedgie 😆. I can’t imagine anyone taller than me fitting in this length wise (which is literally everyone.) I wore this with an undershirt for about an hour and was too uncomfortable to continue. Someone who witnessed me trying it on said “it was too sexy to wear to work” haha"
4.0,Fit was too small but nicely made and great customer service
4.0,"While the materials here are not super premium (and really, you didn’t expect that at this price point, did you?), they do the job perfectly well. These bands are comfortable against the skin, feel lightweight but not frail, and have a nice weave to them. The plastic buckle feels a little cheap (again, the price point!) but should hold up to some abuse.<br /><br />The only negative I’ve found so far is that, when these get wet, they can take a pretty long time to dry. This is not a deal breaker, but anyone who frequently gets their hands wet will not appreciate the slow dry time."
4.0,"Skirt might be a tad short for my wife, but she liked the style."
4.0,"I received the package in a very short time after I placed my order and was pleased when I opened to see my new ""diamonds"".  They do in fact look real and I'm delighted with my purchase."
4.0,"Material is more like a stretchy t-shirt, not typical swim/rashguard material. Worked well enough and decent quality."
4.0,"Shirt is good, but registration is slightly off on print."
4.0,These earrings are very pretty and will be given as a gift.  They are larger than I thought they would be so I hope she likes them.
4.0,I love this robe. It is super soft and comfortable.
4.0,Ran narrow
4.0,"Not much to say.  I haven't used it, but it's very pretty and will be perfect over my suit"
4.0,"It provides zip and enclosed feature what I wanted, it is slightly larger, but acceptable."
4.0,They’re very very stretchy which is nice because then you’ll have to worry about the size of the facia making it for. And I’m glad it came with the flatbeds instead of the barrel ones every once in a while they are not threaded completely properly which is why I took a star off.
4.0,"Pretty good case.. received it in a timely manner. Had it for few months has protected my phone from breaking when I have dropped it. Has flaked on the edges a bit after a few months, but overall a good product for the price."
4.0,"Comfortable but heavy fabric.<br />Easy care.  Not crazy about the larger bottom of the crop pant. If I had felt like it at the time, I would have returned them. I have some of this brand in the same blend of fabric but much lighter weight.  Quality made."
4.0,I ordered two watches for gift and both my friends are very happy. Value for money. Finishing is very good.
4.0,wife bought - decent glasses
4.0,The product was not badd it was not for me of us for my mother for her way that's coming up she has to take it to a tailor because the chest area was what she measured but still does not fit so if they can't tailor it I will have to return it but in all the dress looks really nice
4.0,If your looking at the reviews that means you wanna buy this yeah? Well GO BUY IT! WHEN I SAID ITS GOOD I MEAN ITS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
4.0,"This is much daintier than I expect which I love, I just wish it was just a little bit shorter so it was a tight choker , still goes pretty high up on the neck. Lotus charm does not lay flat against my chest but it’s doable. Gold color is a little too yellow like it’s cheap , I think it’ll tarnish pretty easily. It is really pretty still and looks great layered"
4.0,Stunning! Came in a beautiful package and Bobby pins!!! I'd love recommendations on pinning to the head by your self. It's a bit of a struggle. But with pratice!!
4.0,Fast shipping!
4.0,"Well made and looks just as the pic, however it was too much for me."
4.0,The dress fits nicely except this color allows for the inner lining to show at the chest area. It is unpleasant to see a line across your chest.
4.0,It is exactly as I thought it would be. The lining is soft and warm. Comfortable.
4.0,"professional looking set, Gift for my nephew"
4.0,Liked the colors and sleeve length.
4.0,It's cute.. more like junior size or smaller.. that top is extremely small.. u can always squeeze in the bottom.. but tha top is a whole problem
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:6a1e1659e9551b953e51fb7596ac789d]] The shorts fit well. However, the description indicated they have pockets and the ones I received DID NOT HAVE POCKETS!"
4.0,"Hello, I really like this coat, but I am very short so I should have gotten a XS I got the small bc the chart said too- but it's always hard to know. I am 5'0 and 108lbs-- but I love it and will wear it."
4.0,"It’s really pretty but runs small, it just fit my 6 month old granddaughter and I ordered the 6-9 month and she’s average size, 16 lbs"
4.0,"The ring is very pretty, sparkles alot, down side it tarnished and the light sparkles will fall out. I had them for a bit, too late to return so I threw it away. Good think it wasn't expensive."
4.0,Exactly how I expected. I love the color and the finish isn't scratchy or rough around the edges. The chain is just long enough to allow your to slip over your head.
4.0,"Love the color and fabric, it’s a little big on me but I’ll still wear it."
4.0,I like the top .  Just a little too big
4.0,Cute bracelets. Well priced
4.0,"Cups are smaller than I expected for a 36D. I think they would be great for a smaller chested woman, and may be fine later on while nursing after losing some baby weight. The thing I really like is that they come with extenders."
4.0,I am giving this beautiful dress a 4 because the invisible zipper is difficult to maneuver.  It very easily gets stuck.
4.0,"The look of this purse is very nice. I love the black and brown together. I got a lot of compliments on it too (I say ""got"" because it was sadly slolen out of my car). It is fairly small so make sure you look at the dimensions to make sure it is the right size for you. I did, but I still overestimated the size. If it was a little larger, I would have probably given it 5 stars"
4.0,Nice looking bracelet. the latch is a little tricky though. I still love how it looks!
4.0,"Looks like picture. Very comfortable, good fit. I got the blue and took one star off due to the uneven look of the color. Overall very nice"
4.0,Runs a little small but really like the shirt
4.0,My nephew loved it! The colors and design were very vivid.
4.0,Cute dress and fits good. Material is slinky and I was expecting more of a cotton material. Other wise cute dress.
4.0,"They are very elegant, but the gold color is not as vibrant as the image shows."
4.0,"This dance leotard is very sweet, especially when paired with a tutu. It’s stretchy and comfortable, and is well made. What I like about it is there is enough room at the bum that my granddaughter’s underpants do not hang out.<br /><br />The one I got is white. As with most white things, colorful undergarments can be seen a little, so white or skin toned panties are a must. That is a fault of the color though, and not something I would consider a flaw in this particular leotard.<br /><br />Overall I like this, and would recommend it, though I feel that the price is high for such a small and basic thing."
4.0,Fits like expected and is comfortable to wear
4.0,Good cheap option. They are rather tight at the hem on thigh. I have thick thighs and they were quite snug. But the waistline never stretched out which is always a plus! The pockets are a bonus too.
4.0,I received many compliments on the dress. Felt cute thought covered. This can even be used as a New Year's Eve dress
4.0,"I am very much in the wear them and forget them earring camp.  I want to put a pair in, wear them, sleep in them, shower in them and forget they are there unless I need to change things up for a special occasion.  Every now and then I see something that I like better than what I’m wearing and switch out for another long earring in residency. Haha.<br /><br />I saw these and kept going back to look at the product page.  They look almost artisanal.  They are huggie style.  They are small. And they are listed as .925 sterling silver.<br /><br />I knew they would be tiny.  I wanted them to be tiny. So you can see how tiny and perhaps determine if they will work for you,  I photographed them next to a dime coin.  They do fit nicely around my earlobe without being tight. They open easily and click shut reassuringly.  They are great for anytime/all-time wear.<br /><br />I have no equipment to test them to assure you that they are solid sterling silver, but they feel an appropriate weight for their size.  At this price point, it’s not a big concern to me."
4.0,"The bra itself was very nice.  It was way too small, but that was MY fault for just guessing.  I would consider buying another one and paying more attention to measurements."
4.0,This is cute although it runs a bit larger
4.0,"Although the quality of the sewing and material could be a bit better, for the price I paid, this is a fantastic purchase. The fit was spot on and it's very comfortable. I don't see it surviving a ton of washings, but for the price I could purchase several of these to last longer than a single higher-quality dress shirt and have a new shirt every few months :)"
4.0,Super sift on the outside but the zipper is itchy and still so it rubs and makes a sore spot
4.0,Too small for me. Returned it!
4.0,Not bad. Looks like expected
4.0,"I love this ring. I lost my baby this past year and my husband bought it for me as a anniversary gift. I would have given it 5 stars BUT it has a flaw. The ""buckle"" part is sharp on the edges. It will scratch you and pulls your hair if it gets caught while fixing it."
4.0,They seem ok.  They are just cuff links after all.
4.0,I like how well it matches with the Galaxy Watch 46mm.
4.0,Queda muy bien solo que al frente por el busto queda un poco corto
4.0,"This top is really cute! I normally wear a medium to large, the large is a bit big for me but it fits well without feeling too baggy. I can wear this with leggings and it covering my bum. I wear my beige bra with this shirt since it has lacy sleeves but I could still see my bra straps so I would recommend a strapless bra with this. Since the label says hand wash, I washed this wash cold cycle in my washer and hung it to dry and it doesn't appear to have shrunk at all."
4.0,"Pretty shirt, soft material. I can't usually wear plus sizes, I'm 5' 5'' 173 lbs and usually wear a regular Large, but I tried this anyways because I've got a belly from my last baby still and like my flowy shirts loose. I ordered a XL- US 6-10 and it fit great (a lot like you would expect a regular US large to fit, just covering my butt. I accidentally dried it and it shrank a little bit and is now a little more fitted than I wanted it to be, but that's my fault. As far as the color goes I ordered the wine and it's a brighter red than I was expecting (more of a crimson), but it's still very pretty and I'm happy with the color. Seems like it's well made, other than the slight shrinkage. The necklace was a cheap piece of plastic and not something I would actually wear, but I wasn't expecting it to be too great anyways, and I gave it to my 6 year old, she loves it."
4.0,"I REALLY like these. Flattering. After wearing them a bit, I do have to pull them up but maybe that’s a sizing thing or all leggings. I don’t know. I’ll be ordering a second pair for sure."
4.0,"Decent bow tie, quick shipping, can't beat the price!  Texture of the fabric is kinda funny and it took me a few tries to get the knot straight, but those don't really matter.  If you're thinking about getting it, do it"
4.0,"I got this for my God daughter as a gift, I had to return the first one because it was way way way small .. i had to reorder 2 sizes bigger"
4.0,"The chain is great quality, and came nicely exactly how pictured. The way the chain link is designed it knots up pretty easily. Other than that the chain would have gotten 5 stars, (which is not the fault of the seller.)"
4.0,Gorgeous dress but does wrinkle easily...
4.0,I purchased these for my in home daycare and I will say they work great. I would definitely recommend and will be purchasing these again once we run out
4.0,Much better than those blasted man-made laces. These will keep enough tension on the laces to make the lacing process much less frustrating.
4.0,"Great suit!  I have a long torso so, this suit is a little too short for me but, still wearable.  Very flattering and minimizes the belly a little bit.  I normally try to hide my stomach and this suit looks great.  The only downside is the small molded cups.  I have a larger chest and the top would only fit a C cup or smaller.  Most larger ladies have a bigger chest and I was disappointed that the bra cups would not fit.  Other than that for me, it is a great suit and I would recommend it to anyone who does not have a large chest.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,"Larger than I expected but still fits very well in my small purse.  Love the color, works great for me, suits me just fine. If I ever wear it out I would purchase it again."
4.0,satisfactory
4.0,"This is very well made and the baguettes look absolutely beautiful. It does what it's supposed to do and dresses up a solitaire nicely. However, I think the section where the solitaire fits through is not made with the  specifications of a solitaire prong. Because of this, it makes the solitaire sit really low and makes the ring fit tightly on the finger. That's the reason I had to subtract a star, but overall, it is great quality and looks like diamonds on white gold. Can't go wrong for this price as it is comparative in looks to ringsjackets costing several hundred dollars or more."
4.0,"Really nice looking top made of 95%Rayon and 5%Spandex.  Super comfortable rayon with a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />Nice, roomy fit with cute, batwing type,sleeves. Works great for office or a casual date.<br /><br />Due to the high Rayon content, it is recommended to wash in gentle cycle and iron if needed."
4.0,These shoes are adorable! I was surprised when I got them to see they have shiny stuff woven into the material which I did not notice at time of purchase. Not bad shoes for the price. Very easy to get on. They have a sturdy rubber sole but the rest of the shoe seems to be made of a thin canvas like material which will be fine for the warmer months but not sure if they will hold up. Time will tell!
4.0,The fabric is so nice and it fits me perfectly. I got it for a friend’s wedding and she loved it too.
4.0,Great but they do slide down in the back
4.0,"They help compress while flying (my legs and ankles swell so bad without them), fit as expected, aren't uncomfortable for me to wear for an 8 hour flight. Just what I wanted."
4.0,Our mask came stained but it washed out in wash. Too big for my 12 year old. Would fit an adult.
4.0,Fogs up a little bit.
4.0,Top is big. Extremely long. Nice for the price.
4.0,"Very cute suit, but with a large bust, the top does not support me enough."
4.0,Super soft and so cute!
4.0,"Dress fits just right, not baggy but loose enough for summer comfort.  Many compliments, easy to wash & wear.  I went back and purchased in black too.  Only way it could be better would be if it didn't require me to wear a bra :)"
4.0,These leggings are great but I would wear them under a dress or skirt as they do seem a little sheer to wear alone.
4.0,Great socks .. warm and comfortable
4.0,"This dress is really pretty, soft, and fit perfectly except for the length. It is a wee bit too long; I'm a bit shorter than average person. I will have it shortened and look forward to wearing it to the next event I attend!"
4.0,I've gotten this on two sizes and I love this brand and these shorts but there super tight around the waist.
4.0,"Lightweight, not baggy but - NO pockets!! Fine if you want a flat, smooth look."
4.0,"These are cute.  However, one of the rubber bands popped after the first time I wore them."
4.0,"Material is good enough and warm enough for the winter. too Small for Big people, it doesnt stretch as much but I like it."
4.0,"Weighs and feels of decent quality and looks exactly like the picture, not too big and no too small either"
4.0,A little bit hard to use by yourself
4.0,"For the price it's great, probably won't last forever but cute over a swimsuit. I'm only 5,1&#34; so it was the perfect length for me"
4.0,Well it okay - maybe for kids or teens
4.0,the belt looks stylish .
4.0,"The chain and metal portion of the pendant are more white than they are metallic. It does glow in the dark, but not very brightly"
4.0,"They fit my lenses amazingly well, just a little hard to get on and off."
4.0,The sizes are not true to what it says. My grandson is a size 4 with plenty of room to move around but these pjs are small. He will wear for a couple of weeks only. Can't exchange them because he ripped open the package so he could have them!!!!!!  Fireman Sam is his hero so all is good!!!!
4.0,A little smaller than I thought but it's beautiful and the chain is holding up great
4.0,"Not sure why, but the green color looked a bit odd on me.  Great style though."
4.0,bright color and elegant appearance!
4.0,"I love this charm! It's so pretty. It is smaller than I figured, but for me that was a good thing. I don't care for large charms. The only thing that I had a problem with is the chain that came with it was too thin for me. It is very dainty. I already had a chain I wanted to use it on, but wouldn't fit through the loop on the charm. I had to buy another chain that would fit through the loop. Which was ok for me."
4.0,Nice watch..face and band. Other than battery being DOA...once replaced it's kept flawless time. I don't wear watches in the shower but tried this one....great...no fog in the face or water in the stem.
4.0,"to small, need a size up. I like the coat"
4.0,"Very nice top, only downfall is the arms are a little snug for me. Otherwise it fits very well and covers nicely :)"
4.0,"Very pretty earrings that look more expensive. Sleek, classic look."
4.0,"A lot of reviews stating how bad the band is to attach to the device, but several people have already noted to just remove the OEM plate off the old band and replace it on the new one. Yes, this is not ideal and a drawback to a product that should work right out of the box, but DAMN, look at what you paid for it - can't complain (get what you pay for). Once the swap is made, it works better than the OEM band in my opinion. Just remember to remove the spring also as this is what's causing the slight gap between the band and the watch. I would give 5 stars, but having to do the extra work loses a star."
4.0,"The estimated arrival time was correct; mine arrived two days before the start of the arrival window.  The dimensions of the pendant are 1 5/8 inches high, not including the hanging hook, by 1 1/4 inches wide.  The length of the chain is approximately 24 inches and can be easily switched out to a shorter or longer chain if desired.  The item has some weight to it, which is good.  The green portion is not as bright as I expected, and that is the reason for giving it four stars as opposed to five.  Overall, it is a quality item and one that I'll wear with pride especially on St. David's Day, March 1."
4.0,"The picture makes the wood look red however, it was more of a rosewood (actual wood color) The watch was a gift and it was very well received."
4.0,"I never purchase clothes for myself online but I saw this top and could not pass it up.  I expected to be disappointed with the fit or something but when it came, I was totally happy with my purchase,<br />This shirt fits nicely as expected in my size, XL.  The material is a very breathable mesh material like shown on the arms of this picture.  But the entire shirt is made of this mesh, it is just multiple layers over the body that helps it to not be see through.  I still feel the need to wear a tank top or camisole underneath, I do not want to chance that it is see through.<br />However, I love the mesh material because it helps keep you cool.  I am definitely considering picking up more of these shirts.<br /><br />I received a discount in exchange for my honest review of this product."
4.0,the same its  okay
4.0,These are light in weight - important when pushing thru snow!  Good height  will recommend
4.0,"This hat is awesome.  The Bluetooth speakers are surprisingly very clear.  I have absolutely no problem with this hat...the sound is amazing, and the hat keeps me warm.  The ONLY thing is that you might not want to use this indoors like in the gym or on an airplane...people around you can easily hear your music."
4.0,"After shopping for sometime I finally came across this ring. Nice cut, simple but very beautiful. My now fiance' has gotten alot of good feedback. The picture does not do it justice."
4.0,"I love this dress, it’s exactly like pictured. I am 5’4” and about 125-130 pounds. I ordered a Small. I’m actually 6 months pregnant and it gives me the perfect amount of room to grow in. The only thing is it came smelling odd... kind of like a chemical smell. I have not had that happen yet and I purchased at least 4 dresses off amazon. Kind of sketchy, just have to make sure to wash it before wearing like I do with all clothing."
4.0,The only reason I returned this it's not light up in dark so whats the point.
4.0,"Wife is 5'5"", 150lbs, size 8.  Ordered the dress in size M.<br /><br />Dress looked small coming out of the package, but the material is very stretchy and the M fit great.<br /><br />Despite the bodycon fit, the material, ruching, and ribbed knit do wonders to hide imperfections and lines.  Overall, the dress is definitely very flattering.<br /><br />That said, the cut is a bit weird and is probably better for women with smaller chests.  Mainly, you'll need a convertible type bra if you don't want to see the straps or forego the bra.<br /><br />Overall, a nice dress and very flattering!"
4.0,"Very soft comfortable, not too heavy could be used year round. My only complaint the size is a little small, I want sleep wear to fit looser"
4.0,"I bought this to layer under a cardigan. Based on other reviews I bought 2 sizes larger and it fit fine. I probably could have just done one size up and been fine, but it was under a sweater so it worked out. Love the lace on the top and bottom. Will likely order a few more in different colors. It's not the highest of quality, but it's super cute."
4.0,"Bigger necklace than I thought, but looks nice. Bracelet is a little tricky to get on and off since it hinges by the jewel."
4.0,Like that it has side seam pockets 😊
4.0,The jacket cloth has a good feel and the joker face on the back side is amazing. The size is a bit small considering it is L
4.0,Simple but elegant dress.<br />The silver design is does not sparkle as it shows in the picture. It does show though but not as much.
4.0,This is a very accurate crown. Super cute for my daughter. I took off one star because one of the rhinestones fell off when we opened it. I was able to hot glue it back on so luckily it was an easy fix. Here’s a picture of my dog modeling it with pascal
4.0,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life. It makes it worth the farting noises that your feet make occasionly in these shoes.
4.0,Good and well made
4.0,"Worked great, was glad I decided to install these with a new battery. Would recommend watching a video of how to open the controller to install these."
4.0,Somewhat small in the arms. Otherwise adorable. I’ve worn with leggings.
4.0,"The lower shoe portion of these fits exactly as expected, I wear an 11 1/2 shoe and these have plenty of room, the problem is the calf... If you have Santa size calves look for one of the other versions of this boot that lists the measurements. I have 21&#34; (at the widest point) calves and these were about an inch and a half from zipping up, which is not a problem, just had to take them to the local shoe repair place to add elastic to the upper half for sizing.. The overall quality is really good and the heals are as pictured. All in all, not bad."
4.0,"Good product, well presented and the seller helped a lot with the molding."
4.0,This is awesome my son lives it he couldn't wear it much because it is small and he's a big kid. Other than that it's really cool and realistic.
4.0,"I have 3 kids, two with Autism spectrum 11 and 9 which also so have ADHD. The 9 yr old loves the feeling of the shirt he feels more in control which is nice but I think it needs to have a little weight add to maybe slow him down a bit. My youngest is 8 and I gave him one to see if would help his ADD. He loves the feel also but there has been no change in his actions. So again I think if there was a little weight to these shirts it would be a much better fit for kids with issues. Like the Idea though. Had a weighted vest when the 9yr old was 4 and it was heavy but he grew out of it loved it though."
4.0,"Must buy more. I am 5'6"" and the dress is the perfect length, just lovingly graces the floor.  I pair this dress with a feminine D'orcey flat.  The side slit goes up and up, but stops just in time....In fall I plan to pair with a cowboy boot and denim jacket..."
4.0,A little more purple than pink but good for the price.
4.0,This was a great gift for my son.  It does come a bit bent but its an easy fix either with a steamer or laying it flat under a heavy object for a bit.
4.0,These are handy and easy to carry  in the pocket. Great if you only need reading glasses.
4.0,"I was under the influence that this product would not be glossy as it is supposed to have an antique finish. It is a present for a die hard cocacola lover and I feel a little like I am letting her down by not giving her something with an antique finish. however, the product did arrive when expected and  the image looks wonderful."
4.0,I love this necklace. Whenever I wear it I think I will have good luck that day. It is really uniquely  beautiful shamrock pendant with a bit of variety on each leaf. The necklace runs through the stem of the clover so it hangs upside down. The right 2 leaves are a green crystal heart shape with a little green crystal in the middle of each leaf. In the middle of the clover is another green crystal. On the left upper leaf is a solid metal leaf. The bottom left leaf is a silver background dotted with tiny green crystals. This leaf is my personal favorite leaf but combined its just gorgeous. The chain I like I wish it was Silver but it is Alloy Nickel free. I haven't had any tarnishing on it yet though. It still is a shiny metal. An 18&#34; chain with 2 inch extender. The chain links are also unique I haven't seen links like these and it rarely kinks. Overall It is super cute especially with pink yellow blue and purple clothing. I received a sample in exchange for an honest review.
4.0,"Not so easy to put on and take off but otherwise great materials, looks cool, appears to be far more durable than standard leather bands. And no annoying spring pins."
4.0,Great charge but needed an attachment piece to a add it to my daughters Brighton bracelet
4.0,It is very nice. Looks slimming! Good thing i ordered an XL. I am very short just 5 feet and it looks great. I am planning to wear it on my brother’s upcoming wedding.(reception dress) i love the color. The only thing is by the armpit area a bit big but i would rather wear a slightly bigger one than a tight one.
4.0,If you have large breasts you might want to reconsider this blouse.
4.0,"Good cotton tee.  Cute images.  I am a woman, true size medium.  I ordered a medium.  Should have bought a large.  Shirt cut small."
4.0,These are going to be perfect for the upcoming school year. Durable for all the stress a child puts on shoes.
4.0,"Like that they aren't too heavy but they are a little bigger than what I was expecting,"
4.0,"Nice, but not really slim fit."
4.0,"I’m super pleased with this dress. For reference, I’m 5’5, and my meaurements are: shoulders 47.5, bust: 45.5, waist 36.5 and hips 47.5. I ordered the XL and it fit perfectly, a little bit loose on the waist, but it isn’t noticeable unless you’re the one wearing i, and it actually makes the dress more comfortable. It goes about 4 inches above my knees, which is the perfect length for me. I ordered the red, but it is more of a dusty pink color, which I din’t mind. The fabric is okay, on the thinner side, but it isn’t see through. One thing I really don’t like is the fact that the underneath of the fabric is white. Makes it look like a cheap dress to me. Other than that, I don’t have any complaints. All in all, it is a very good dress for the price."
4.0,Liked it very much.  Clasp is hard to use.
4.0,Its super cute but the sleeces are tight and short.. the pic shows the sleeve goong to the wrist.. mine stopped at just below the elbow. Il be sending this back. :(
4.0,I ordered the blue one which is part denim material. I was a little skeptical but I've received many compliments. Large enough to hold all my personal items.
4.0,Pretty and stylish!  Runs a bit small.
4.0,"Missing the belt, but otherwise a gorgeous dress,  lace is really delicate though."
4.0,"I LOVE this dainty lotus ring. Absolutely no complaints. Looks just like the ad. I’ve attached 3 pictures for reference on look and size/daintiness.<br /><br />Updated: Three months later and I do still love my ring, but it has cracked right in the middle on the back due to the malleable nature of the ring. Proceed with care if you decide to purchase."
4.0,Real stiff
4.0,"Overall it's a good band for the price. It came very stiff. I'm hoping it will loosen up over time. The second keeper is a little big, but it's not bad."
4.0,I purchased these at Costco and loved them.  They are great pants but the same size runs different in almost every pair.  The pair I ordered here are about the smallest so far. I can still wear them but they definitely fit tighter than the ones I purchased at Costco.
4.0,"perfect for our soccer tournament.  Ears stayed warm, but didn't get too sweaty and then cold."
4.0,"Runs a little big, but paired with leggings make a great outfit for Fall"
4.0,"Great jacket, love the colors. I got it a little big so it would be baggy and it’s perf. Just a little thin for the upcoming cold weather, but perfect fall jacket"
4.0,Fit well and is a comfortable slipper.  Nice quality.  Delivered on time.
4.0,"Cute top, good quality, but it was a bit too large on the sides (5 ft tall, 110lb, 32A) but hopefully I can shrink that with the washing machine or some little pins. I think if you have bigger boobs than me it will fit you beautifully. It was also shorter than expected so my belly button is exposed but can easily be worn with high wasted pants or shorts. Also arrived faster than expected."
4.0,Looks greate for the price. My kiddo loved it.
4.0,Worked well in Washington DC on a rainy day. Especially for the price.
4.0,"Decent wristband. Attached securely and look nice enough for the price. Be aware that these are the size of the small charge 4 band, so if you don't have very slim wrists, you may want to look elsewhere."
4.0,"I love the non-slip grip, but they do hurt my feet when have to slip on shoes over them to walk the dog."
4.0,"I bought 2 dresses and they both fit the same but the front ""bra"" part goes a little higher than expected. No worries. Still a cute summer dress. Very light and airy."
4.0,Lo compré para utilizar solamente el marco
4.0,"Nice hat , bit expensive than most hats , but its nice"
4.0,"I really have good luck with Bandolino jeans for the most part.  The stretch helps.  There is a pretty noticeable variance in cut between the different styles and even within the same style from time to time, so be prepared to potentially have to return a pair or two.  The black jeans will need to be washed more than a couple times to set the dye.  Be prepared to look dirty if you don't really wash them.  I forgot about this and ended up looking like I had not cleaned my nails in a long time and kind of looking like I must work as a chimney sweeper with grey/black film and smudge on me.  Despite this, I really like these pants."
4.0,I bought it for seven-year-old granddaughter<br />She loves it
4.0,"Smaller than what I would like, but it fit.  It's also stretchy, and I didn't expect that."
4.0,"This fits my six year old well. We cut holes for her ears and she can wear it all day with minimal complaint. The filter is a nice bonus, however, it is a little cumbersome with the material."
4.0,Has a very real appearance and feel to it and it works too! I ordered as an accessory to a Halloween costume and it worked great.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the back glass was shattered when I recieved it.
4.0,Beautiful...looked just like the picture. Loved it!!!
4.0,"These earrings are beautiful! However, I had to return as the color did not match the necklace I had, and they were bigger than expected. But they look beautiful."
4.0,evn though the size was what i wanted the design of the frame gave a much smaller look than the picture showed...it sems that the frame makes the size void if going by measurement....
4.0,"I have used it twice so far. I haven't experienced any issues (dull and brittle hair, hair loss etc.) Application is easy, I could color my hair without any help. Fumes could be strong at first but it becomes better after about 5 minutes."
4.0,It is longer than i expected.  The inside is so soft
4.0,Super cute but order a couple sizes bigger
4.0,"Beautifully made. The color is a pretty, light dusty blue. All pockets are real! The jacket is fully lined. I am in between sizes right now due to a weight loss journey. Mostly, I can fit into xl but the pants are a little small on me. Order a size up. This suit is worth the try. The material feels very nice and not cheap. I can’t wait to lose a few more pounds and this will be perfect!"
4.0,I didn't realize it was flat metal. Still looks better than a regular belt buckle under clothes and holds my pants up.  I mainly purchased it because I wear a back brace and it kills me having that buckle dig into my muffin top.
4.0,Lights in the mask are perfect but the mask is a little deformed.
4.0,too small but thats just cuz i got a big head and im very picky. but a good quality hat
4.0,Bought this for my teenage son and he wears it every day.  The headset can be removed so the beanie can be washed.
4.0,"I bought these because I have issues with my legs and feet. My husband, having bought bought some similar socks, recommended that I try some, so I did. They are helpful for leg support, but if you're looking for foot support, there are much better socks on the market. I also purchased socks made for plantar fasciitis, which better suit my needs."
4.0,I loved it . Unfortunately I thought it was a skirt only and returned it. You can use it .. both ways !!... the only thing is the waistband a little tight .. I am a size M... the color and fabric are great so is the look
4.0,"Liked, and I used it for a pin that had lost its back"
4.0,"Ordered Large, but they fit like a Medium.  I normally wear a 10-12 Misses, and these are almost too tight.  I would recommend ordering a size larger than you wear.  The material is very good and they have a nice, wide waistband."
4.0,Fit was great. I got an x small and I am 5'4&#34; and about 110 lbs. I thought the color would be a darker navy blue.
4.0,"I love these glasses, Perfect size, great quality. and very a very economic purchase.<br />I am not a ""I only want big brand names"" type of guy, and these pair proved why.<br /><br />They look nice, feel nice, and work just fine."
4.0,"After my initial purchase of this shirt and returning it for a larger size, I like it quite well so far. If you are more apple shaped than pear shaped, I would suggest going up one size from your normal size as it is form fitting. The material is somewhat thin, but no so thin that a cami underneath would be necessary. Would work great with jeans or capri, but would not be long enough to wear with leggings. Nice shirt - would definitely order again!"
4.0,"Not as soft as another nightgown but excellent quality, cotton and no flame retardants"
4.0,"Good quality, but very small"
4.0,I like it and it but it is not made for a floor length gown.  It was too short for my 7 year old daughter.  I would buy again for a tea length dress.
4.0,First quad - much better control than heli of abt same size. Instructions are pretty sketchy but useable if you don't mind squinting at small fonts. Required some fine tuning (hover low and tap adjustment buttons until hover approaches stationary). I used a king size bed for the initial setup. If you stay very low you can chop the throttle when it starts to get away from you and not cause any damage. The LCD display is so far useles. Assembly was quick and straightforward but had to tighten one of the propellers before it would fly properly. The included screwdriver is marginal (bit too small for controller battery panel and slightly smaller than other screw heads. These are nits. Overall excellent value for money spent.
4.0,XL was big on the top and sweater<br /> Pants small. Looked more like a home outfit.
4.0,"Although it pouches in the back and could use a few more notches to tighten, the design is beautiful and the quality high. Sooo many compliments."
4.0,This dress is beautiful but runs a little<br />Large.
4.0,"Two large and heavy earrings, two small and light earrings. Quality isn't great, works for short term wear."
4.0,So nice. The clip is almost too  tight to put stuff in so that's why I gave it 4 stars
4.0,"Bought this for my daughters birthday party. It's a very pretty dress and made well! My only issue is that it's very ""roomy"" in the chest area- which is something I wasn't wanting in a little girls dress. It was too late to return or to buy another in a smaller size."
4.0,Really loved these pants but they run big. Had to send back
4.0,"I have a thing for ear rings and making sure they are not too big but not too small either. (I personally feel the big earrings are just…. Too much) Either way I ordered these because I have two piercings in both ears and needed earrings. I also prefer the screw on flat back ear rings because I have lost so many backings to ear rings in my life. (They all end up either in my bed or somewhere around it.<br />I ordered these and they came in a nice little bag and I got 6 (or three pairs) in different sizes in length. Which is nice, if you have different piercings in your ears. I recommend them, and will be purchasing more when the times comes.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for mu unbiased opinion. I have no reason to lie or fabricate my experience with the supplier."
4.0,"Love it, just wish it was a little smaller"
4.0,"Nice color, easy to read, lovely enamel look. The only drawback is the thickness of the pin backing makes it difficult to pierce fabric with and may leave obvious holes behind."
4.0,"I really like theses earrings. They are large, about 2 inches in diameter, thin, and light weight. I can wear them all day without any issues."
4.0,Nice case.  Could be more contoured to your face.  Overall good and clear but let some light in the sides because they are pretty much straight horizontal to the face.
4.0,Very cute the pockets are small but it holds a phone and a small wallet nicely.
4.0,I’m a true 2x.  Fits to tight.
4.0,"I am 5'3"" tall, usually wear a size 8 or 10 (here in the USA) & wear a 38DD bra. This dress is VERY small at the bust line...if you are small up top, this will fit you nicely. However, if your girls are generous, don't waste your time. I sewed a hook & eye to the button front where it was gaping & it split down the back of the dress. I would have sent it back, but I added the hook & eye to the front.  I sew, so I took the sash & added a placket in the seam from the elbow of the sleeve to the waist. It now fits in the bust line & upper arms which were very snug, but the dress is not my favorite. I have a belt that will work with it. If you have bigger boobs get at least 2 sizes larger than usual."
4.0,I love the band but the face protector is a pain and messes up my Fitbit.
4.0,Very nice sweater. Fits just as expected
4.0,Great for the price. My nephew loves basketball and I wasn’t willing to fork out the price of a real jersey for a small kid. He loves this set and it even came with an armband. Awesome Deal!
4.0,Very well made..I used scarf for a dress.
4.0,I ordered one as a gift and one for myself.  When I opened up the first one and the stitching came undone.  The 2 me one is fine so I will give it as a gift.  I really love these as I have one I purchased a year ago in a different color and love it.
4.0,"Really cute. Came in an envelope shoved in the mailbox though. It was very crushed, and the top was all dented. But I used my facial steamer on it for a few seconds, and the bumps came right out!"
4.0,I ordered this watch for my dad as an alternative watch for him at a very affordable price.<br />Classic analog display with day and date system along with the leather band make it look classy.
4.0,So glad I ordered this much nicer than the picture makes it look.
4.0,Nice boot would buy again they look great ordered one size up but I always have to in boots.
4.0,"it works, but it seems it's not what i want, but useful in a way that if you have a luggage that needs extra belt so that it will not spill the inside or will not loose important clothes inside the luggage."
4.0,"I always wear BOC, comfortable and the price is right"
4.0,"It looks great, and is a fun wallet for a Star Wars fan, though feels just a tiny bit cheap in some places."
4.0,Great sliming top and awesome color.
4.0,It's ok. A little larger than the one I bought many years ago. A medium probably  would have been to small
4.0,nice cardigan
4.0,Fairly comfortable. doesn't stretch very much. Okay sound quality. Very warm. Very good for its price point.
4.0,Great service and reasonable price
4.0,It attaches to the watch perfectly and is comfortable to wear.
4.0,"Please note, the sellers who post these products often have various brands from different makers in their offerings.  In this case the blue camo is by ""addicted"" which says on the inside tag ""Born in Barcelona""  These are the ones to find.  They have the best sizing, as well as the best quality fabric both outside and inside.  I have been wearing this suit for over a year and it's still kicking strong.<br /><br />Huge plus:  The inner lining is on the front and back, so it is less likely your butt cheeks are going to show through the fabric.  Two ply, less thing, more security.<br /><br />I did purchase another from the same amazon vendor.. and sadly.. it was not the same brand.  It was a chineese brand with much larger sizing which got sloppy on my figure, and the lining on the back wasn't there so more see through.  I instead screen printed my own logo on the back to cover up the see through parts.<br /><br />If you purchase any of these budget brand suits, if there is any way to ensure they are ""addicted"" brand from Spain, those are your target!"
4.0,"They fit nicely. I usually wear a 10, but when things are sized 9 and 11, I do go up to an 11. That proved good. I accidentally ordered cropped, but they were just fine and not too short which is good because I'm kinda tall. Nicely distressed but not torn to shreds. Only very minor critique is they fit a little looser in the knee. I'm hoping with a wash and dry they snug up a little"
4.0,"good fabric, well made, very cute. a hit."
4.0,Very attractive design.  Tie came somewhat creased in packaging which doesn't settle easily out of polyester.  Can't beat the price even if it is polyester.
4.0,"No more tying needed with these laces and also look great not to have extra laces floating on top of shoes. Only used them for about a week with my regular day to day shoes so I am not sure about their durability, but seem slightly thinner and weaker than expected."
4.0,I have a nickel allergy and it definitely  gives me a rash but besides that it’s so cute
4.0,"The socks look exactly like the picture, it is basically a flat tube and not formed in a foot shape like normal socks. However, still wearable and cute. I wear a US Women's 7.5 and they fit fine.<br /><br />I actually wear a pair of no show socks and pull these over them, so I'm not just having basically a sashy net on the bottom of my foot against my shoes."
4.0,This was one of the only 18 gauge nose ring packages I could find. I wish there were more styles because it's good quality and I would buy from them again if they put out more 18 gauge.
4.0,most of these charms have english words on them but two of them had a different language on them. the point of what it’s suppose to be still gets across though so i’m not upset about it.
4.0,For the $ these are nice ties! They are made well but would prefer silk knit for double the price
4.0,"Received the wrong color, but it’s a nice wallet"
4.0,"Dress is very cute and fits great, the only downside to it is the material is very sheer, and you have to wear something underneath of it..."
4.0,such a deal not for heavy winter but nice enough to walk the dog
4.0,smaller than I wanted but good quality for the price....
4.0,"It's beautiful, but I don't like the yellow (actually is gold) string. Yes you can use it with different outfits, but think of the necklace as a &#34;statement necklace&#34;."
4.0,"Very light weight, but too small for a men."
4.0,"Was pretty, no give"
4.0,It is a little floppy in the bust part but the material is great! And it fits great!
4.0,"A gift for my 18 year old , we are huge Mamma mia fans"
4.0,Nice item however I like my nightgowns to be very loose fitting.  Nothing to be tight in the night.<br />Therefore consider this when you order if you feel the same way.<br />Makes for a nice housedress too.  I have been wearing mine around the house to stay cool and comfortable in the summer months.<br />Recommended with reservations noted above about the size.
4.0,"I am 5 ft 5 inches tall, weigh 139 pounds, 38 inches hip, 29 inches waist and 36 B cup bra. I bought the size 36B/80 . The panty is a little tight around the waist and thighs but not to the extent where it is unbearable. The bra straps fit perfectly but the cups look like 34B . They are small and only covered half the breasts. I am overall ok with the purchase because it's wearable and makes a great push up bra. Sexy. The material is all mesh (including the panty)  and the leopard spots are like a deep wine red/burgundy but not brown. If you need tight and sexy push up look, you can buy your exact size. If you want comfort and full coverage , buy a size bigger."
4.0,Fit a little wider than expected.
4.0,"I like this watch, it was very inexpensive but I get compliments every time I wear it to work."
4.0,These are XXXXXL lenses. Perfect for professor Trewlawney cosplay awful for being cute.
4.0,"This product works,make you feel relax and at ease. It also balances the body helping it to heal. I bought a few for the family already. ButGreat Orgone well put together on the (Neg) side the leather necklace is a little short."
4.0,"I ordered the blue one, it looks fantastic, but the reason why I gave 4 stars is because the slots are big enough to hold credit cards, but not enough for business cards. After you pack it up with 10 card at least ( including IDs and credit cards and memberships ) the wallet looks stuffed a lot. but still, it looks awesome and at feels good on the touch."
4.0,"beautiful, I just kept losing it."
4.0,Looks nice and has a good grip!
4.0,Grandaughter loved that her doll got a matching set!!
4.0,"The dress was great, I bought it in white and it was slightly sheer but you can get away wearing it without a slip"
4.0,Runs a little large but I would purchase again.
4.0,Designs stuck together. Some pulled slightly loose while separating the gloves. Otherwise not bad.
4.0,"I have a very hard time finding rings and studs for my nose piercing. My nostrils are small so those coiled type do not work well for me and the hole in my nose closed up a bit from not regularly wearing something in it, so it's difficult finding a gauge that will fit.<br /><br />Zhenhui Stainless Steel Nose Studs are pretty much perfect for me. I was able to get them into my piercing hole without any discomfort and pain. These are the type that have a little ball on the end to keep it from falling out, also known as a nose bone or a nose pin. The ball did keep the stud in place and prevented it from falling out but it wasn't so large that it was a pain to get out of the piercing hole. You may want to secure it with one of those clear silicone backings that are on most earrings when you buy them if your piercing is a little larger. The posts are a little too long for me which makes either the stud itself stick out from the piercing or the post to stick into my nose. That isn't a flaw in the nose ring at all since the length is stated in the description but if you have smaller nostrils, these may not work well for you. I had no issues with the metal, which I expected from stainless steel. I have allergies to certain metals so I have to stick with either stainless steel. Had I had any reaction I would have known if the description of the metal was misleading, which it was not.<br /><br />While the posts are quality stainless steel, the crystals do not look well attached. I'm worried they will fall off of the post easily. But for the price you are getting 48 studs (24 clear and 24 assorted colors) if I lose a crystal here or there, or even lose the entire nose ring I don't find it to be much of a loss. 9 dollars for 48 nose rings is a steal. I'm considering buying another set but in the 1.8mm crystal size since the 2.5m crystal size was a little too large for my taste. I'll still wear them but I do like a smaller crystal, especially since I'm with a toddler practically 24/7 and the larger crystals attract him, so he tries to pull it out of my nostril which hurts!<br /><br />Personally I find the Zhenhui Stainless Steel Nose Studs to be a fantastic buy. I don't think you can find this quantity of studs for cheaper anywhere else, especially not at any big chain stores like Hot Topic, Claire's or Spencers.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. These words, thoughts and opinions are entirely my own."
4.0,Good solid silver bangle however the quality of the silver used is not that great.  If you want the rustic look then this is for you.  It does not have the good quality silver jewellery shine and the whiteness of good silver stuff.  I know a good one when I see one as I'm crazy about silver!
4.0,The dress fit beautifully!! The picture was a little different than the dress actually looked though. Everything else about the dress was perfect.
4.0,Not bad.  Seem a tad under magnified.  But okay.
4.0,"We made the mistake of ordering the Amazon Brand - Goodthreads Women's Heritage Fleece Basic Jogger Pant during the late spring. They are heavy and think and definitely geared to fall and winter outdoor exercising. But for those seasons, they are nearly perfect. In fact, my wife’s only concern is that they tend to be sized too large."
4.0,"I love this shirt. It is super cute in and extremely flattering. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the material is just so thin, it definitely could be better quality. Overall, I would buy again because it’s just that cute."
4.0,Bought for my daughter.  She loves it and fit her great.
4.0,It fits fine until the stomach area. It's a bit snug there.
4.0,Glad I erred on sizing and ordered much larger than usual.  Shrinks a lot.
4.0,Son loved it. No shrinkage post wash
4.0,"If this had not been longer in the back i would have had to return. It was a little shorter than expected in the front but wearable. I also have a large chest so i'm guessing if you have a smaller chest that will not make it ride up as short in the front. It's a little boxy for a dress but i wore it with a jacket so you couldn't tell. Overall, great price and the material is soft. Purchased in a small. 5'7'', 145lbs, 34DD Usually wear a small or medium."
4.0,I ordered a 3x thinking it maybe was too small since I wear a large...I'm a 38 b cup and 170 lbs it's way too big an xl would of been good.
4.0,I was reading the reviews so I sized up I normally wear a 2xl I’m 5’6 256lbs and so I went with the 3xl sometimes I like dresses a tiny loose but it’s a bit large especially in the breast area and pretty long I step on it a bit when I walk wish I would of ordered a 2xl and stuck to my original size but i love it it’s a beautiful dress can’t wait to actually wear it on the beach! I’m just gonna have it hemmed up a bit more and it should be fine My advice is to just stick to your original size don’t siZe up they come a bit long and larger all around great dress! Pretty comfy after I shortened it up!
4.0,Very thin<br />You pay to much for what you get
4.0,"Short handles, but still cute"
4.0,Fits just as expected. Good shirts for the price
4.0,Great grippy bottoms but they do run tight.
4.0,Its ok for the price. Worth a shot if you are on budget
4.0,If you are over 6'4&#34; they maybe to short
4.0,"Nice and soft, not thick and bulky. Def sizes run smaller than normal and just an "",iron on"" type but very nicely done. I would order from then again. It came a week quicker than shipping said also."
4.0,"The dress was beautiful, unfortunately it wasn’t meant for me. The material was soft and flowy. It ran a little big, I ordered a large (38D), and the back was open so it hanged a little too big for me. I think it’s perfect slimmer figures, ir perhaps order size down especially if your in between. It boxed me up."
4.0,Very pretty but the flower fell out after a few uses. Just hot glued it back.
4.0,"The hook is difficult to figure out at first, but overall a very nice watch for the price."
4.0,"This is a really cute dress in theory (it looks so fun in the photo - the version shown with a hat). Up close, it isn't exactly what I wanted. I ordered a medium, as some folks said it runs small - not at all the case for me. I feel it is way too big for me. Normally, I'm a 6/8, so medium usually works, but in this case it is too large. I'm not sure what I'll do with it, but I don't feel too bad as it was inexpensive."
4.0,"This sweater is like wearing a blanket! So many people compliment the softness when I’m giving people hugs. I wear a small and the small fit me perfect and still gave me that loose look. I didn’t give it a 5 because the zipper feels a little cheap. Overall, love this sweater!"
4.0,I like them I just thought the ankle would be more tight. But they are super cute anyway and comfy
4.0,"Update: I also ordered the grey and white striped jumpsuit. It's very a cute on my daughter and doesnr have any issues with the buttons on the bottom. These are loose enough on the shoulders you can pull it down the arms and body if there is a diaper mess. She is 7 months, very tall and about 20 pounds- wearing the 12m size.<br />This is super cute but I would carefully at the buttons.<br /><br />This little romper or jumper is very soft. The material almost fells like a moisture wicking material but is extremely stretch and soft. I feel like at first it does look big but it shrunk a bit when I washed it. My first one did have a quality issues- one of the buttons was bidding the bottom portion to hold it on the fabric was missing. I was able to have a replacement sent for the buttons issue.<br /><br />Even with the first jumper having a flaw I am still so happy I ordered this. It looks absolutely adorable on my<br />Daughter and I can tell it is comfortable on her. The arms are longer- they go down to about the bend in my daughters elbow.  The legs do ride up as my little girl scoots around the floor."
4.0,I like the size and detail of this pendant but it has some sharp edges such as the item in his right hand and tusks that can catch on clothing. I like to rub my pendants with my fingers and this one has those jagged edges so it’s not ideal...
4.0,"Comfortable and easy to walk in!   I can't believe how comfortable they are - I feel like I could walk all day in them.  You won't be sorry at all. Great quality and look great on my feet! Platform is a good height—not too low, not too high. Appear to be very well made . These look just as described and well packed when I received them."
4.0,Arrived brand new. It’s a knock off but really nice.
4.0,"They run a little small, but the price is great"
4.0,So far I really like this watch
4.0,More purple than I anticipated but well made. Will look better in other colors for me I'm sure. You can't beat it for the price
4.0,I like it a lot and it's very pretty! I received it between the time frame which I was very pleased with as well!
4.0,"This sweater runs larger than expected, so I would recommend sizing down. The material is very soft and cozy. It will be a great addition to add to your wardrobe for cooler fall weather.<br /><br />This sweater can be worn to work or dressed down casually with a pair of leggings or jeans."
4.0,It arrived with 2 piece that came off 1 of the earrings. After I reattached they were perfect.
4.0,The pajama material is thin. They are comfortable to sleep in though.
4.0,"This was a last minute purchase -- my eight-year-old son's previous closed-toe, water-friendly sandals failed a few days before a weekend camping trip.  In late August, not many water shoe options are out there, and Amazon came to the rescue with both available options and prime fast shipping.  My son wore the sandals all weekend, brand new with no socks, with no discomfort.  They worked well for tromping through shallow creeks, and dried quickly in the sun.  I was concerned that they had less support/a more open structure than his previous pair, but he seemed more than able to trek and climb hills without slipping around; multiple straps provided good adjustability.  Now I may get a pair for myself!"
4.0,4 stars for now (as I haven't started nursing yet).  Received on time and as expected.  It fits a little more snug in the band that I would have expected but this is definitely the softest material imaginable.... I can't imagine a scenario where this will be uncomfortable once I do start updating (though I will update once I start putting this to use!)
4.0,"I returned several sport bras, but kept this one. It was supportive for higher impact and intensity classes without being too tight."
4.0,"Good quality, It seems to actually be from the concert"
4.0,Super cute bought for my sons school 100 days they are super cheap so they are not durable but they will work
4.0,A little large up top.<br />Length is perfect!<br />I'm 5'2 size xl<br />Not see through.
4.0,"When I bought this watch I was afraid about the charge time, but it is not a problem, I used just like other watch and it is always charged is very light, the only problem is that is easy to scratch it."
4.0,Good bag at a good price.
4.0,"I was surprized that the CZ was very sparkly.  I am a jewelry snob and just purchased these because they were different and I wasn't sure if I would wear them often, so I did not want to spend big bucks.  They looked pretty on and I will wear them.  It just seemed odd that the back part was so large."
4.0,Love how soft and cool they are. Wish they were a little taller in the waist. They fit a little big
4.0,"Although, this shirt is too big, I chose to keep it because I really like it!! I would have rated 5 stars but it runs way big. I ordered a xl which is what I generally wear. I probably could have worn a medium in this shirt. I just pinned the shoulders and kept it moving. Since the shirt is layered, no one noticed it. The feel of the shirt is soft and comfortable. I like it a lot!!!"
4.0,Looks as pictured. A little small but overall good quality especially for the price!
4.0,"Simple design,can hold a lot of stuff,if the details can do a little better,than perfect!"
4.0,It's cute just took a while for delivery
4.0,Fits really small I wear an XL and the 2xl Was to small
4.0,Cheap but for the price they're great.  Best of all I don't worry about scratching or losing them.
4.0,Goes perfectly with my dress.  Really like it.
4.0,"Apron for women: my first apron, so have no comparison to any other apron.<br />The apron fits me well, i am probably a l or xl and this product fitted around me well.<br />The issue I faced was with the shoulder strap. I am 5'3 -5'4 in height, and the shoulder strap kept slipping off, as it was loose. The strap has button holes, and the button is on the waist strap. So the shoulder strap was loose, when I tied the apron around my waist. For taller folks, there are many button holes to fit height. I did do a workaround, which doesn't give the look but I can use it well without difficulty.<br />Apart from that, the apron is made well. The material is thick, not flimsy. One wash, and it will be able to absorb better. It's really white and the frills look good. It has 2 pockets for keeping items. I can put my hand Inside the pocket fully.<br />Overall I love this product.<br /><br />I did receive this at discount or free in exchange for my review. I have been using it for few days before posting this review."
4.0,Little too big for my 2 month baby.
4.0,I have been wearing these sandals for about 2.5 months. I have severe plantar fasciitis pain in my left foot and mild pain in my right. With these sandals I can actually walk around all day with significantly less pain. They offer super arch support and have good traction. It is recommended that you order down a size if you are in between sizes. My only complaint with these sandals is that the footbed is already peeling and rubbing away in spots. So far it isn't severe enough to make them unwearable but I'm not sure if they will be presentable at the end of the season.
4.0,"I thought these were going to run small or the quality would be bad because of the price I paid but to my surprise they were actually really decent. They are thin but warm and the length and waste size is about right (I am 5ft 10in 190lb a little over weight). The one thing I didnt like about the product is the drawstring size and the holes where the drawstring goes in. The string is very short, almost non existent and the holes literally look like holes. Ive only used them once for casual wear but I feel like the holes will unravel or rip over time. If the string was a little longer and the holes were stitched, I would give 5 stars for sure! I ordered 1 pair to test them out. I ended up liking them so much that I bought a 2nd pair of the same color and 2 additional colors, 2 each for a total of 6 units 3 colors."
4.0,I LOVE these sunglasses. I have worked in eye wear for 4+ years and these are great quality frames. The only down side is that my hair gets caught on the part of the temple (leg) that goes behind the ear. This isn't a huge issue but something to note. They have a good weight to them. They have the feel of luxury eye wear. The lenses are very nicely tinted. Would definitely recommend these.
4.0,"It's a cute sweater! It seems to run big, though, I ordered a M thinking that I wanted it a big bigger to lounge around the apartment, however, it was too big, so stick to your regular size. It's not very thick or warm, so it works as a fun layer to wear with jeans or around the house. The ears are the cutest!"
4.0,"Very nice, super sparkly!  The chain for the necklace however broke the first day, fortunately my husband was able to fix it.  Possinby a little more substancial chain should have been used."
4.0,good product just what I expected
4.0,Great shirt..sized perfectly
4.0,"These totes rock! Not only did I get these days before xmas, because I'm such a late shopper. #lifesavers....but they are strongly made and super cute. I used paint on these a personalized each one, and it came out great! I wish I took pictures. The paint stayed on very well, and everyone loved their gift! These can fit quite a bit in them too since I stuffed them full you can definitely through groceries in here without worrying the handles will break. I'll be buying more for myself soon, and I got a holiday extra bag for free that's super super cute and all decorated! Recommend this for sure."
4.0,Fits will but little tight. As what expected with color and as it looks
4.0,Satisfied with fit.
4.0,"These were a gift for my mom. She is diabetic and her feet swell so it's difficult to find comfortable house shoes for her. She said they were a bit warm for the summer, but she was able to walk and have them on without too much pain or discomfort. She liked them."
4.0,Soft and shipped fast
4.0,"not bad looking, at all"
4.0,These are biking shorts with padded seat they fit ok they are soft in feel they are vented like basketball shorts...so they are make to help give comfort with the memory foam covering your seat..
4.0,"They are cute but the look slightly cheap. I know you get what you paid for. I wanted these for so long so I’m happy either way, it’s not they are for daily use anyways"
4.0,I really like the look and functionality of this belt. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the belt is a little too wide to fit through the loops on my basic cargo shorts.
4.0,Looks awesome. My husband is very happy with it.
4.0,It's smart looking. A bit large. The fabric is a bit more coarse than expected.. I wore it to dinner with my Valentine last night!
4.0,Ordered as a gift. The dress did not compliment the figure of the wearer.
4.0,"But very well made, though pricy"
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a7f98d602cd41ebd079b2ed9bf77b342]] I got this to go with my skeleton jumpsuit to wear at my friends huge party that was all night long, reading the reviews, I was nervous that it would be broken upon receiving or break easily during the night, but it was handled with care & was packaged with foam to keep it in place & I was just extra careful to not drop it. I love the color of how it looks like real bone. The strings are a bit awkward, you have to adjust them to fit around your ears, however, this is a heavy mask, so I had the strings tied not just around my ears but also around the back of my head/neck under my hair to hold it in place. I have a smaller face so this mask works out great for me shaping perfectly with my face & jaw line still being able to talk & even drink (bottled beer) haha, but I would just move the mask down & wear as a necklace to give my face a break since I had it tied behind my head/neck.  I wore it all night long at the party & was dancing as you can see in the video & it didn't budge, I also wore it during the whole day on Halloween& got a lot of compliments on it.. I had tied it a bit tight so the bridge of my nose got a little sore.. all in all, it was worth it!"
4.0,Looks and feels like a plastic toy. Will give to children. Better luck next time. Still happy.
4.0,Runs fairly large. Got it to layer under shirts and had to re order the smaller size. I'm a pretty curvy size 12. Medium was what ended up fitting. Soft and plenty long which I love.
4.0,Small but mighty. Plain yet get the job done. Nice charm. Shiny and sturdy.
4.0,Very nice more casual ware  than sport
4.0,"These are too cute but too heavy, had to send back. :("
4.0,"Flowy and and flattering. Lightweight enough for very hot summer days, but not clingy."
4.0,these shoes are very comfortable and the size was as I expected - comparing them to a previous pair of the same shoe that I've worn for a few years now and the same size.  Not much for arch support but I use an insert and they are very comfortable.  I basically &#34;live in these shoes&#34; during the winter months as they are warm and easy to get on and off because of the side zipper.  A little stiff but I'm sure will soften up some after more wear. I would recommend these.  good quality for the price!
4.0,"Four 'pins' - one of them is a good bit larger than the other three.  One of the smaller ones is in two pieces - the pin portion is not attached to the circular part - not sure how that one will work, but may be fine. (Does not appear to be broken, just a different way of using it.) They are shinier silver than they look in the picture.  I wore the larger one and it looks great, held well in a bulky crochet garment, and I am pleased with it!  They arrived quickly."
4.0,I got the outfit in size 3t-4t for son's upcoming dino party.  Absolutely love the colours and it seems true to size.  The shirt is a just fit but the pant has a bit of growing room.  Only complaints are the shirt has a polyester feel and see through thin.  Not a deal breaker as it was bought specifically for the party.
4.0,I love the look of the socks.  They are fun to wear.  My only issues with them is that they are not as stretchy especially in the calf area as I thought they would be.  I would recommend them to anyone with a slim calf.
4.0,Used it for event
4.0,Needs more fabric to have the gathered look as in the pic
4.0,"Granted I'm 5'10&#34; and 200#s (37&#34; waist} so I've got big legs but I was crossing my fingers that they'd stretch a little more and be less of a knee support and more like socks on my knees.<br />When it's really cold my knees ache by the end of the work day of working in the cold but I don't want something that actually supports my knees as I walk about 10 miles a day on concrete and supports over time actually weaken the support muscles by taking their place, causing much more knee pain from weak muscles.<br />They are constructed very well and feel like they're going to last a long time plus they do warm my knees up but I'm only going to use these on days when the temps start off in the single digits or lower and only until things warm up into the 20s or more . If they made some about an inch bigger in diameter they'd be what I was looking for."
4.0,It's just as described
4.0,Great quality. A little on the heavy side compared to other similar styles I have bought in the past.
4.0,"I purchased these for myself and my daughters for a girl's weekend. They are nice quality. The band on the arm was a little tighter than I prefer but my upper arms are large and honestly, the pants looked better putting them on backwards 😊 but we all loved getting them and continue to wear them.  They're nice summer pajamas. They do not feel cheap and they wash nicely."
4.0,Super warm and a great price.... A bit boxy but overall a quality product.
4.0,"It didn't fit me so I give it to my mum, who is much smaller."
4.0,"I wish it was either a little smaller or a little larger to fit my phone. still cute, i love anything lesportsac"
4.0,"The size was small, but it was what it claimed otherwise."
4.0,Fit well very comfortable white area is see through when wet
4.0,"It's nice, but already has a whole under the arm that I need to stitch up now. :("
4.0,"This dress is pretty cute! I am a size 8- 140 lbs and 5'9&#34; and it fits well, reminding me of retro tennis sweaters I wore as a teenagerl. I am thinking of wearing it to work in the summer and add a blazer for fall. Good price point and this brand usually washes well although I have not tried yet."
4.0,"Pros:<br />-snaps! Not Velcro<br />-4 snaps down front- it won't open on you<br />-super soft material<br />Cons:<br />-elastic in top is very tight<br /><br />I absolutely love this towel! While my husband is deployed I am staying with my in-laws, that means that after showering there are a multitude of people in the house. Because I have two young children I normally shower with my son and when I walk out of the bathroom my first job is to get a diaper on him… That leaves me walking from room to room trying not to drop my towel.<br /><br />I love that this has snaps and not Velcro – it because my previous towel that was similar to this would get gobs of hair in the Velcro whenever I washed it. This material is super soft and absorbent. The towel actually has two layers of microfiber rather than one. It's fit in cozy, and it is not see-through at all. The tile has for snaps down the front of it which is nice because you don't have to worry about it opening up while you were walking. It also has a nice little doily, or crocheted detail around it which just makes it look nicer.<br /><br />The only negative I have is the top elastic of the towel. I am 54 and I weigh 145 pounds. I am a size 10 in jeans… The top is very tight on me. I'm hoping that the elastic actually loosens up overtime because it will leave a red indent on my skin if I wear it for too long. If you are any bigger than a size 8/10 I think that you would not be able to button on the top of this.<br /><br />Review by P. Thomas- I received this product for a discount. This is my honest opinion of the item and is not influenced by any discount. I don't  give good reviews just because I received an hour a discount- you can look on my reviewer page to see I give a wide range of 1-5  star reviews.  I am NOT paid to leave reviews. Thank you!"
4.0,Well made beautiful quality but I ordered a 3 - 4 and received a 5
4.0,These are so awesome but they do not have ability to use my phone so I have to pull them off when it is really an important call. But I still love them!
4.0,seems like good quality but way to small for a &#34;large&#34; go up a size!
4.0,I love this necklace but it’s a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It’s still beautiful though.
4.0,the shoes were a bit too large but they will be ok when wearing socks.  they are the right &#34;ankle high&#34; & no higher which is what i was looking for.
4.0,Girl friend birthday gift
4.0,I like the feel of a jacket very much. It is warm and for the most part needs all my expectations. My one problem is that it is slightly small around the hip area. If I have to jack it up slightly and zip it I can pull it down so that it fits over my hips but I cannot zip it in that position. That is why I would not give it 5 stars.
4.0,"I wear a size 12 up top and purchased a Large.  Fits a bit small in the bust and I am a small C, but oh so beautiful.  I purchased a lacy bralette to go under it that matches the pink perfectly.  Thinking about buying another pattern in XL.  I would recommend ordering large."
4.0,They fit very tight around the hips and waist. If you do not like tight leggings size up.
4.0,That's cute!
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE this dress. I'm 5'2&#34; tall, with a 34DD chest, so I ended up having 1.5&#34;  taken out of where the collar meets the bodice to get it to fit just right (and not show too much cleavage). The fabric had the perfect amount of give too, so it never felt too tight or snug. I got a million compliments on it. It was perfect & I will probably buy more of the same dress in different colors."
4.0,Shirt was a little to big for me and the Flag was crooked so it's going back.  tshirt feels really comfy so I'm bummed
4.0,"Great price for a ring that won't activate my nickle allergies! AND it comes in sizes that fit my ridiculously large fingers. The flower is fairly large, which I wouldn't normally go for, but it's cute. Well worth the cost."
4.0,Large around the waist but tight around the legs.
4.0,"Great product. The skirt and corset are two different pieces, making getting into them much easier. Both fit as expected. This item is great for romantic evenings."
4.0,Works and feels fine. Perfect for the 2015 Moto 360!
4.0,"It took a little over 15 minutes to help her put the earring on, since the bar is pretty short and the ball was pretty tiny to seal it and twist. It also lost it's ""shine"" after a week. It is a nice way to show off personality without doing too much and people only see it when the hair is pulled back. You will definitely need assistance with this piece but worth it!"
4.0,"I'm 5'2"" 34C 130 lbs and I ordered a large! If you want to achieve this casual off the shoulder look you are going to have to size up!<br />It came as the green pictured. It's thinner material than I expected but I actually like it light weight and my bralette will show through a bit. To get the full off the shoulder look I'm going to undo the little bit of stitching at the bottom of the V where the last grommet is. I'm pleased with it.<br />*If you tuck into leggings you'll get rolls."
4.0,Nice belt for woek
4.0,"I really love it, it's super comfortable. It doesn't pinch at all, and it doesn't irritate my skin the way the silicone ones do.<br />But the color isn't 100% consistent, and I can tell it will continue to fade over time. No other complaints."
4.0,"I love the dress ,but is too small"
4.0,"Bought all the black colour in this dress. Size medium.<br />It is not tight but form fitting, very flattering and gives you a nice shape.<br />I’m 4’9’ 32DD.<br />The dress is very light weight, you can wash and wear it doesn’t require ironing.<br />However it’s on the thinner side but doesn’t necessarily need a slip underneath, but if your going in the sun or on a stage with a lot of lightening , like a spot light directly on you wear a slip underneath, if your on the more conservative side.<br />It’s a great dress for everyday work especially on the hotter days when you want to look professional but don’t want the added heat.<br />After buying 2 dresses to try, I found that they washed very well, no shrinking or fading. I’ve since then ordered all the other colours that fits me no regrets."
4.0,"sleeve arrived torn.. other than this its a cute fit,sweater is veryy fluffy"
4.0,Pretty pattern and I’ll for sure use for my honeymoon. I bought for my bridal shower and felt it was a little too snug. Good quality for price
4.0,"Very pretty piece! It's my favorite. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the gold color is just coated, and it's done horribly. It's starting to fall off and I haven't worn it yet. My piercer told me to never wear it, just because it could tear tissue and cause rejection.<br />But, like I said, it's gorgeous, and I've gotten so many questions on it, and I haven't even worn it."
4.0,but is on the small side for me .Ive recently gained weight on new meds and Im learning to adjust to new sizes. I love the suit and plan on returning it for next size up. The colors are crisp and navy and white is incorporated in of my life !
4.0,getting used to a minimalist wallet
4.0,"Cute cardigan, thin material. Not bad for the price. Ordered a medium as that's my normal ish size (always between a small and a medium) fits perfect."
4.0,I got my daughter and me one. They are thin but perfect for a southern winter. Love the design and that the sleeves are different colors.
4.0,The only downside is that there is some visual distortion due to the shield bending. Other than that it’s great protection
4.0,Just the right size and has enough of pockets.
4.0,"This product lasted less than advanced, only 9 mos. Fit and felt great, but expensive"
4.0,"Nice sweater, just didn't fit and had to return."
4.0,It rusted quickly but its a great necklace
4.0,I needed adjustable masks because many didn’t seem to fit me well. These masks fit me well are lightweight but effective and comfortable to wear. I found them easy to adjust to the best fit for my face.
4.0,"These are aesthetically pleasing earrings.<br /><br />The black color has stayed true over the years, the edges are not sharp or pokey, and they feel well-made enough to use without feeling like they'll break when you put them in.  On the whole, that's about all you can ask of an earring.<br /><br />The one caveat I can offer is that these earrings seem to pinch a bit more than most I've worn.  I don't know if this is because the posts are too short or some feature of the backing that closes them too tightly, but after a full day's use they definitely make my ears feel more sore/tired than most other earrings.<br /><br />It also is worth noting that these earrings are smaller than you might expect.  I didn't mind this, as generally men's earrings are better off being small than big, but it is something to be aware of.<br /><br />Overall these are nice earrings and I was satisfied with them for years."
4.0,This is perfect for my work boots to dry them. Small enough to take up little space but works great
4.0,Little hard to put on. They do stop me from bruising my arms
4.0,"nice but not what I expected, did not fit"
4.0,Perfect for travel.  Only drawback is that I wanted a daily use purse and now I find this too large for day to day use.  I will probably give it to my daughters.
4.0,"I wore these shoes for my wedding. Our colors were burgundy and orange and these were a perfect match. However, they ran a bit small and I wore them weeks before the wedding and I still ended up with a couple of blisters."
4.0,"This was a great deal for a cute bikini.  Nice soft pink - good fit.  Style of bottoms is cheeky and maybe more of the higher waist type, but I pulled down.  Bottoms fit a little larger than the top.  For reference, I am small chested (B cup), 5'5, 120 lbs and ordered a small."
4.0,"The costume is gorgeous once ironed. I ironed it on the silk setting, the polyester setting was too hot. It’s definitely worth the money. But at such a low cost the quality is not great. The seams on the arms started to unravel when I tugged them during ironing. And the pieces of the gold trim started to unravel, too. I had to sew them in place. I would recommend this if you have the time to iron it and only intend to use it a few times."
4.0,Use for around the house
4.0,[[VIDEOID:e1d5919b815c7881e8ad169c8cb03e0d]] Pros:<br />Got this for my son who is 15. I have to say I really liked the chains very sturdy. I’m also liked how both chins are different sizes. My son really liked it.<br />Cons:<br />My son and I did not like how small the cross was. It literally looks like a baby cross. In the pictures it looked bigger. We did not expect that which that was a bummer. I also do not recommend this for a man. It’s is too small for a man unless they want to wear a choker with a baby cross. This is more for a young boy and teenagers.<br />Overall good product and quality. My son is happy with it.
4.0,My style.
4.0,Very nice sinple but still sexy dress.
4.0,"The bags feel sturdy and fold back up very easily! I'm very excited to use them. However I was dissapointed to only get the stars pattern. But, that's just a personal preference!"
4.0,"I am pleased with this purchase. The shirt is slightly smaller than I anticipated, but it still fits well. If in doubt, I would size up. It is a very cute top."
4.0,Beautiful pants!
4.0,"Bought the black cheetah/leopard and the colorful cheetah/leopard hats. The black one came first and definitely does not look like the pictured item. The print around the sides of the hat is very enlarged, looks more like snake skin or camouflage print. The top of the black one is the print I was expecting all the way around. Still looks okay when I wear it, so I’ll keep it. The colorful one turned out better than expected as far as the print. Was worried, because I got the black one first, that I would be disappointed with the colorful one but was pleasantly surprised. Each hat has a cotton band in the inside to absorb sweat. Decent quality not too thin. If you’re someone who gets hot easy this may be too hot for you. They’re a good fit, not super large. Will fit the average-sized head well."
4.0,The hat looks good and fits good.  Just be aware that the roman design is a decal installed using heat.  It is not machine embroidery and may not be durable.  I still like the hat but will need to protect it
4.0,It was what was expected.  I have one in white.
4.0,"I am a size 8-10 pants and I needed to get the XL because I wear these as yoga pants. Unless you are wearing these as tights, then you could go with your normal size. Cute design and fit well when you size up."
4.0,"I really like the top of the dress, but not so much the bottom....maybe it's just how it fits on me. The material is soft and stretchy. Good dress for the price."
4.0,"These are okay. I was hoping to like them better, but I’ll still keep them. Cheap material but light weight for summer. I’m a size 4 and got a medium. Fits good. A small would have been too tight on my hips I think."
4.0,"Item as described. Great size, good quality with flexible/adjustable sshoulder strap. Perfect spring / summer bag!"
4.0,The beige with peach top is see through in the skirt part. It’s more white and see thru
4.0,Nice style for travel...saving it for my next trip....
4.0,"I loved this dress so much that this is a reorder in a different color - fabric is wonderfully soft, dress looks stylish belted and is basically the best pajamas unbelted. Love it."
4.0,"Just received my order, and I'm actually well pleased with the quality of the backpack. It seems durable. It is also lightweight and has many pockets. I like the fact that it has a little thing in the back which is convenient when traveling abroad and with a luggage. Not sure if it's water resistant, but will be able to test it out more in the coming months. Happy with this purchase! Can't wait to use it on my camping/hiking trips!"
4.0,"I love dresses. So, I definitely love this dress. It fits well for a large. Thanks."
4.0,This is a well made suit. The leg openings are a bit loose. It really needs to have an attached panty to make it comfortable. I ended up ordering some shorts to go under it for modesty.
4.0,feels very nice
4.0,These boots were apart of my first Cosplay and it was an a amazing experience. Comfy and fit perfectly these boots completed the experience.
4.0,Looks cute. I like the print and color but not a fan of the rayon material that the dress is made in. Can wear it in winters though.
4.0,These look amazing on!!!! Some of my favorite shoes! The do fit a little snug but I just wear thinner socks. My feet are wimpy so don't judge my review by the length of time that I am able to wear them if you normally wear heals.
4.0,Good quality and great fit. I like this brand and have a hard time finding them at stores close to home. Glad I was able to order from Amazon.
4.0,"These are comfortable in the feet, but my major complaint is the stitching around the ankle that says ""wulf"", it's actually a little irritating to me. Maybe over time it will wear down and not be bothersome, but that's almost a deal breaker for me. I think I'm just hyper-focused on it right now, and over time it will be better, it's just a little scratchy but tbh I didn't even notice it until I was about to write this review."
4.0,I love this shirt. It fits great on me. I think the price could be a little lower but it's so cute.
4.0,Very hard to install from my perspective
4.0,"This piece has an odd fit. It's tight on my legs and butt, but has an abundance of room in the belly area. The pockets are very low, basically on either side of the crotch. Either way, it's fun to wear and very comfortable!"
4.0,"I bought these as running shoes to replace my black Nike free runs that were getting too worn out. I'm on a budget and thought they would make the perfect compromise - still cute and sleek looking but cheap! I got them in the mail and they fit as expected and look really cute so overall I am happy with them. However, I can't give them five stars for two reasons:<br /><br />1) There is pretty much no arch support so I wouldn't really classify them as &#34;Running&#34; shoes - at least if you're planning to run more than 3 miles.<br />2) They are kind of slippery - I tried to wear them on the elliptical when I first got them and my feet kept slipping forward. I hadn't worn them outside yet so I'm hoping they'll get some grip after a few wears."
4.0,"They was comfy, and my granddaughters enjoyed them. I thought some were too big, just didn't hang right. The lace added a nice princess touch. Over all, everyone liked them."
4.0,"It's a standard hat, except now I can put my pony tail higher on my head, the color is slightly different than what is pictures. In the picture, it looks more bluish green and what I got looks more blue, but it's not a big deal for me"
4.0,"I really like it, It is a little big around the neck, but is super cute"
4.0,"A very nice product, but be careful wearing for extended periods of time! I wore mine for 3 or 4 days straight (taking it off to shower/wash hands/sleep) and on that last day i noticed my fingers had turned green. Everything else about it was great, and long as you don't wear it for too long you should be fine."
4.0,"Ordered a pair of these and really liked them.  Smooth, soft material.  Ordered a second pair from the same seller, and they did not appear to be the same as the first."
4.0,Good look for price
4.0,Comparable to Eberjey but a lower price. A little baggier but comfy.
4.0,"I love these keychains. Bright and colorful. I wish I could still order them, but they no longer make the single keychains."
4.0,Cute. Wore it for a tea party.
4.0,"I like my waist trainer because it has a corset, a zipper and Velcro straps. It will definitely make you sweat and the length covers my entire torso. The only downside is the size I ordered...<br /><br />**<br />Before purchasing I recommend ..<br />- Measuring yourself & then ordering ONE SIZE SMALLER.<br />I wish I had known this before because the trainer has no room to get smaller, it is on the smallest setting with my true measurements."
4.0,It is what I expected. Looks nice
4.0,Shirt fits nice and tight
4.0,Everything fit alright but if you got big boobs and I don’t like it low cut than this isn’t for u
4.0,"its not thaaaaaat small, but kind of  I usually am a size small and I ordered a medium and fits great especially in the arms and shoulders! I'm 5'1 and 130# and its long enough to cover my butt! I LOVE IT! the only thing is, its a lighter blue than what is pictured but still love it!"
4.0,This is rather small but it does fit a woman’s wrist.
4.0,The quality of these shorts are great however they do run a little small.......... I am 5’9” and 135lb and the weight fit me after I had to squeeze my hip through.
4.0,"It is a snug fitting dress in the top but not constricting, nice and long, and I am 5'9&#34; tall. It's a very pretty dress. I am happy."
4.0,Overall quality is good
4.0,"Ties are a great value, but only adjust down to a 15&#34; neck size."
4.0,It’s perfect just ran too big for my grandchild but a pin and clip and she was happy
4.0,Look old
4.0,"Super comfortable and stretchy yet gives ample support. The support band doesn't dig or rub. Not a fan of the removeable cups. They show through the bra and my shirt, and I can already tell they will be a pain to put back in after washing."
4.0,These earrings are very pretty and they were loved by the receiver. Only con is that the posts/dangle is very thin and fragile so unsure if they’ll have longevity.
4.0,I'm pleased with the deep blue color of the earrings but would have liked them to be a little larger.  I'll pay closer attention next time.  Thanks Amazon & associates for your wonderful choices.  MM of Texas
4.0,I usually in size wear a small but after reading all the reviews about sizing I decided to try a large and it was a prefect so when ordering go a size up from your regular size.
4.0,they do make the shoe a little tight but have worked perfectly so far
4.0,Excelente relación precio-calidad
4.0,Two came in the package and that was perfect for me.  I couldn't find credit card sleeves for my old Coach wallet and these did the job quite well.
4.0,Very pretty even though it's a little big.
4.0,"The hole, where your earring stem is placed, is small, but the product works well."
4.0,"These lights are VERY WORTH the price for the quantity.All of them WORKED!!! I've used them when I fly my kite at night, and place them on my dog when I take her out for a night walk and let her loose at the parks. BUT keep in mind that if you order them for some birthday party,,, ORDER THEM WAY AHEAD OF TIME!!! They took about 1 month for delivery since they are shipped out of China. And sadly they did not arrive on time for my son's birthday party,, but that's OK,, I don't blame the seller."
4.0,I was reading reviews and based my size off the fact several people said it ran small. However I completely disagree. I am normally a Medium and ordered a large and that was a complete mistake it is way to big everywhere.
4.0,"I generally prefer not having a seam down the center of the seat of my underwear (as these have), but I haven't actually had any problem with it. They are VERY low rise. I don't have a whole lot of butt, but enough that these often show the top of my crack. Otherwise very comfy and nice.<br /><br />For reference, I bought a L and I wear 32 pants."
4.0,Its beautiful but the stem of the earrings is a bit too long so the ball part kind of always looking like it's coming out of my ears. I don't like how it makes the earrings look when I'm wearing it.
4.0,Uncomfortable with how the pearls stick out on chest area. Maybe not best choice for large chest.
4.0,Works as displayed. A good accessory for fans of the games.
4.0,Nice! I just haven't had a chance to wear it anywhere yet.
4.0,"This umbrella is only suitable for children or ""life size"" dolls. You could possibly use it as a prop for product photos. Definitely do not recommend for brides or adults of any kind. I returned it immediately."
4.0,Cute style and print but the material is thin and I normally wear a large and this was too big overall. I'm a 38B.
4.0,"Globenfeld  Super Sport Metal Men’s Watch  came packed with out any damage in a gift box. This watch is made up of metal body and metal band. This watch has got stylish and elegant look. This watch features stopwatch with lap/reset, alarm and calendar windowed with individual dials, back light function,30 m water resistance and its face is large and it is easy to read. The time is either analog or digital and with digital option we set the time either 12 hour or 24 hour military time format. Also this watch comes with 5 year Manufacturer's warranty, so that we can buy with confidence"
4.0,Bonitos pero no eran lo q esperaba.
4.0,"I love this suit. Nice coverage, adjustable straps and no fear of a peep show when you’re swimming. I love snorkeling and I feel like this will hold up well and I won’t have to constantly adjust it. Lovely colour too.<br /><br />The only downside is the “tummy control”. I’ve had a lot of abdominal surgeries so my abs are shot to pieces and need a little extra help. This does a good job of disguising but less so for actual control.<br /><br />Pic shown and for reference I’m 5’6 130lbs and ordered the small and feel it’s a bit big on me. I do love it though"
4.0,"Worked okay, but this is not a good shape.. simply a throw with a notch cut out. I wish they would shape it like a real poncho with a proper neck cutout and longer sides."
4.0,M is S<br />L is M<br />Xl is L
4.0,Cute one. Little small but looks good with any official attire
4.0,"Cute shoes, light up nicely. One shoe did not charge the first time and they did not stay lit for more than a full day at school. I will see what happens with the next charge. I'm giving it 4 stars for now, but if they continue to have charging problems I will change my review."
4.0,"Pros: For the price, you can't beat them. Delivered way sooner than the estimated date. These tapers go in smoothly and make the transition easy. They are more attractive than post tapers, and are comfortable to sleep in.<br /><br />Cons: The quality of the acrylic is decent enough, but still flimsy for the smaller sizes. When I began to sterilize them in boiling water they began to warp, and when I sterilized them with rubbing alcohol the shiny varnish came off (when you have them in it's not very noticable). When I tried to put one of the 14 gauge tapers in it broke while I was bending it to fit around my earlobe. And, as others have mentioned, they do not come in separate packages for each size, but if you look closely you can tell the difference.<br /><br />Summary: These are great for beginning to stretch your ears, as long as you are careful not to bend them too much and you don't mind a matte finish."
4.0,"Product is true to the seller’s photos. I got it for a beach trip and for around the house, but I really like the feel of it and will be wearing it more than expected! You can wear it straight as is or tied at the bottom like the picture, which is what I prefer.<br />While it fits mostly as I expected it to, the arm holes are a little big for me. I think if I shortened the straps it would be perfect, however I have a short torso so it could be just me."
4.0,somehwhat small but the color is beautful. If i order again i'll order a size up..
4.0,cute fits good
4.0,"Very easy to load with keys. Only problem is if you put the ring on it, you can't extend the keys to use. I had to remove the ring entirely."
4.0,"Love it, I’m a size 14 and 5’5,  Fits perfectly. Very comfortable. Material is a little thin but a good fit."
4.0,I bought them for my boyfriend for summer
4.0,"They are really cute, I didn't like that they came with 2 of the same color in the pack. Also they are very short."
4.0,She said it fits great
4.0,"Very cute crop, love the idea but the execution was lacking for me. Bought 3 different sizes to see which would fit the best; small, small petite and medium. As you can see from the pic all three arrived very differently. The color, material, tags, stitching & even packaging were all different. The medium was my favorite. The material quality was fantastic, it was that kinda stretchy cotton athletic material that feels really soft and moisture wicking and the color/stitching was great but it was too big for me. If I knew that I would receive the same exact product in my size when I reordered I would buy 30 of these tops. But since I can’t be sure, I might refrain from repurchasing after I return. For reference; I’m 5ft, 115lb 32c & the small petite was the best size for me."
4.0,Super soft! A little snug on my chunky baby. Better got skinnier babies.
4.0,"I received a couple of compliments on the dress, which was nice. The material definitely feels rougher than I expected- perhaps “cheap” would be the appropriate description. The purple was not as vivid as pictured either. It looks a bit washed out.<br /><br />The bow that is wrapped around the waistline is held in place by belt loops. The loops are a bit too loose, but not glaringly obvious. However, I was bothered by how the waist area would ride up if I lifted my arms. I’m not endowed in the chest area, so that might contribute to the odd fit. Tightening the bow helped somewhat, but not completely."
4.0,"This is a dress for a short girl! It's actually a lovely, light cotton. The colors are nice and the fit is fine. The only thing I don't like is the &#34;belt&#34; - it's very long and kind of useless. But as a 5'4&#34; person, I was expecting to have to hem this dress- but it fell to the tops of my feet perfectly in flip flops!"
4.0,"Comfortable workout set, thick material. Looks great.. Runs a bit small so size up."
4.0,After reading previous reviews I ordered a medium which fit. It does come a little big but it worked well.
4.0,"I love this brand,I wish they made more  styles in  my 12  medium  size."
4.0,"Really cute dress that is perfect for times when you have to get dressed in a hurry. Comfortable and super roomy, I probably could have went with a large instead of an XL. Material doesn't hold wrinkles, so a low passing of an iron is all that's really needed."
4.0,they were very useful need it them for a concert and they work just fine my daughter seem to not be bother by them<br />quality looks good and sturdy
4.0,"Love it!!!! I have a big tummy and finally found something I can wear to the anime convention! However, the pink part doesn’t look as bright as the picture. But it’s ok!! First time cosplayer here we go!"
4.0,Love it looks so real and fits my wrist perfectly
4.0,The top fit perfect absolutely loved it! The bottom was a bit snug.
4.0,Don't like how far down the dollar bills are in the wallet.  It is just going to take some getting use to.
4.0,Too big for my 5 yr old who usually wears a small in most sizes.
4.0,Runs just a little bit big but is good
4.0,"The design is adorable!!! Exactly what I was looking for and the perfect gift for my husband’s birthday from our son. The quality of the fabric is a little sub-standard compared to other aprons we have. It’s not the thicker cotton you usually find and has a plastic feel/coating to it. I am hoping it will relax with use/time and be a little less stiff/crunchy. Overall, very happy with it and my husband loves it :)"
4.0,Cute sunglasses. The lenses do scratch easy. You have to wear them a few times to stretch them out. They fit tight behind the ears.
4.0,"This top is really cute and the material is very soft.  I bought it in black and can wear it with jeans or yoga pants.  It is really flatting and simple.  I think it runs a tiny bit on the smaller side, but not enough to order the next size up."
4.0,"Received fast, just as described!"
4.0,My daughters loved them.  My only complaint is the filters dont stay poor burr other than that it's great
4.0,It’s well made. The only thing I did not like about it is the breast inserts but they can be removed.
4.0,Liked the set for leopard print. Didn’t like the way the hats is too damn small. Hats too damn small and it slowly inches off your head.
4.0,Love these leggings as always!
4.0,I ordered my regular size since a lot of reviews said these run large... but mine are smaller than expected; really tight in the waist band (returning them). But the fabric is nice and soft and the cut it cute. I ordered another in a larger size so hopefully those will be better!
4.0,"These earrings are Lovely and just what I was looking for.  The leverback appears to be a bit delicate, hoping it will last with regular prolonged use. The color is beautiful and for the price, a great buy!"
4.0,"Very cute socks!! Wear them a lot!! They fit pretty snug but I'm a size 6 and have skinny feet so idk how it would fit people with bigger feet, overall they were great!"
4.0,Very well made and SO SO cute!!
4.0,lots of compliments!..i dont wear the top..just the bottom!
4.0,"these pants are a foot to long for me' I know, I know, alter them"
4.0,This was bought as a gift for a friend and she loved it! Material is soft and not stiff and boxy like most standard tees out there! Will buy again!
4.0,"These look amaaaaaazing. But if you have sensitive ears like me, these may not be the best. Even though they are stainless steel or sterling silver, its still kind of irritating. However, they are super cute and I got tons of compliments on them! Also since they are cheaply made, they do break and bend easily. I didn’t even get to use one of them because the stones came right off"
4.0,love the size. Fits well in suitcase. A lot of room
4.0,"Nice hat, gesring up for suns championship run. Just arrived a little smashed in its plastic bag but i think it will get its form"
4.0,Fits my 3 year old well and he looks absolutely adorable! Giving it 4 stars only because a slightly more snug fit would have been just perfect. Arrived earlier than expected which was great and I was able to get a lot of cute pics following snowstorm Jonas
4.0,This dress fit as expected and was very cute.  My daughter wore it to homecoming.  One issue we had was some gaping around where the back comes into the waist band.  We used double sided tape to fix the issue.
4.0,Is actually a little large. But that's ok since it's a cover up
4.0,Its a nice bra it just wasn't my size.
4.0,He retired as a Master Sergeant several years ago.  Up until recently he had never had a MSgt. cap to wear.  It is a very nice dark cap to wear in cool or warm weather.  It is not a cap for hot or humid conditions.  It is a nice cap for him to wear proudly.
4.0,Original Review: Matchstick legs are needed for a perfect fit. Unrealistic sizing. Not even my 10 yr old could fit into them. Waste of money.<br />Edit: NEVER trust your child to check out a product.  Check it out yourself.  These socks actually stretch and WILL Fit.  THey will come in handy on our next ski trip.
4.0,"I love it and get many compliments on it. Sturdy so far, yet light weight."
4.0,"Fit as expected, comfortable!"
4.0,Not exactly what I was expecting from pictures just snaps onto the phone works pretty decent until you throw your phone that'll break it... lol  pretty tough but not nothing like an OtterBox
4.0,2 of thesevwere gifts but we all like the fact that it keeps our purses off the floor and out of other peoples reach.
4.0,"Scratches easily, but is high quality."
4.0,Every time you go to charge the watch if you don't put the pins in the right spot  the pins  get pushed<br />in and will not work again  so I keep buying the charger to charge my e pro watch  I have no choice<br />they need to fix the charger  so the pins will not get pushed in  stupid design
4.0,Awesome for keeping documents and extra crap in your bag organized.  Its kind of heavy though.  Not sure why.
4.0,Love the shopping box. Much easier to use than the Tote Bag style. They hold a large quantity of groceries and the insulation is good. The only reason I didn’t give them a 5 Star rating is the zipper. It is rough running and tends to stick especially at the corners. A slightly beefier and smoother zipper would make this a solid 5 Star.
4.0,Hat is great- ordered the navy with white. My only concern is the seam is by the bow or basically on the side of my head.  I assume it should be in the back but dont want to send it back if i get the same issue. Anyone else have this seam next to the bow?
4.0,"I love the material and the pocket for my phone unfortunately, they run a size too big. The material is very stretchy!"
4.0,Fits amazing! Was surprised at how well it fit
4.0,"These are,real cozy and very warm.  I have arthritis in my hands and wanted a cover that is lightweight.  These fit the bill.  The only thing is,that the thumb holes go only and 2/3 of the,way up my thumb.  I'll probably just snip them."
4.0,"These are fairly small bags. They have mesh lined centers on one side (for breath-ability), and plenty of zippered pockets. Canvas type material should hold up well to handling. They only have a hand carry strap, but would be better if they included a shoulder strap.  Not sure how much gym gear you can really get in these due to their size, but they are handy for smaller items. One of these is slightly smaller than the other (when they arrive, one is packed inside the other). Still, for general use, maybe even as a lunch bag, these are pretty good. If you wanted to pack shoes in a suitcase, these would work well to keep the shoes from dirtying your clothes."
4.0,I purchased my dress in purple.  It's a great color.  It fit as expected.  It was comfortable.  Great dress for the price.
4.0,Do not buy. The product is not as shown in the picture or on the package. The pictures shown are clearly not what Was received and are intended to deceive the consumer about the quality of the product.
4.0,"I wanted to love this suit. I bought it in two sizes, L and XL. The large top fit and was super cute, but the bottoms were close to thongs! The XL bottoms fit better but then the top made me look like I was 7 months pregnant again. I just couldn’t justify keeping both to mix and match the tops and bottoms."
4.0,I always receive lots of compliments in this dress.
4.0,"I don't usually like flip flops, because they give me blisters between my toes. These shoes are a super soft material though and stayed comfortable all day! They are a little weirdly narrow, but not enough that it's uncomfortable."
4.0,The green wasn't as dark as I expected but still a stylish shirt.
4.0,We have 2 sets of these. However we had to cut off the tops of the rubber bumpers as our scupper holes were a tad small. This works great for us and to remove them all we do is lift the bow up and the wheels fall out. You just need someone to grab them from under the kayak before you set it down. Our only issue is the tires going flat but I see now they have revised the tires to solid ones so they will now get 5 stars from me
4.0,Buy a size larger... They run small. Cute tho :)
4.0,"the feel of the knit is nice, and very comfortable for travel"
4.0,"The band is heavy duty and holds the Fitbit nicely, it's just a little hard to snap the clasp together!"
4.0,"Got it for my man and he loves it...its his everywhere, everything bag lol"
4.0,I’m 5foot and I got a medium. From the comments I thought it was super short but it’s not. It is thin so I have to ware a shirt underneath/spanks. It was expected. Only reason I didn’t give it five stars is because I received it with a stain on it. Something black of course. Hopefully I can get it out of the white dress but it was unacceptable.
4.0,Somewhat small but for a little tight. Comfy!
4.0,"I loved it, ordered it for Easter, and when it came in a bag that said large, but the jacket was a 2X, way too big for me, first item I have gotten from Amazon that didn't work.....a little disappointed...Just have to return it....."
4.0,"Bigger than I thought, super cool! I thought you would click and light would stay on but it’s only on if You’re pressing down"
4.0,Very nice quality and so happy to find the beautiful blue color choice!
4.0,Great fit- especially for the price!
4.0,"I'm giving this a 4 Stars because when looking @ the pic, it apparently had green amber leaves along with it's amber stones. There's no green, amber leaves whatsoever. Just tiny spots of cognac set in metal.<br />I'm considering returning it. I don't know if it's worth it. I've bought 2 prs of earrings to go with it. I love amber for it's beauty, but mainly it's pain relieving properties. Since starting buying + wearing amber, my wearing of Morphine patches + taking Vicodin has lessened immensely. This pain reprieve shocks both my husband + dr.<br /><br />Moms give babies teething rings made of it for pain relief.<br />We had amber collars for our dogs made too. It naturally repells fleas + ticks."
4.0,It was a birthday gift my daughter love them
4.0,Super cute. We got the wrong letter... so that kind of stinks. But it's cute and my daughter loves it.
4.0,good material and perfect for my event
4.0,"Happy with my purchase. It's the right weight and fit, though I took the advice of others and ordered the S/M (I'm a female, 5'8&#34;, and about 150 lbs). It's long - almost to my ankles, which is what I wanted, and the sleeve openings are big enough to be comfortable without taking out everything on the counter when you reach for something!"
4.0,This was exactly as pictured. I hope my sister in law likes it.
4.0,This is my favorite hoodie out of all the rest. The inside is incredible soft and so far after 2 washes has held up. I decided to size down based on the size chart and got a large and the fit is awesome. (I’m about a 46 inch chest and a 38 waist for size comparison). It’s great fitted feel that I can put it under coats to add layers. It’s also great on its own. I wash in cold and no shrinking. It did come with a few loose threads so I removed 1 star but seems durable so far. Good price point and way better than the ones I got from target that cost more. Definitely b than the paper thin ones from Walmart.<br /><br />I will probably get another one when the time is needed so far it’s the best one iv found for a good price.
4.0,"Love the fit and slight compression. I use them as a regular undershirt, and the only small issue is that the contrast stitching on the sides shows through some of my white shirts when I raise an arm. A minor quibble."
4.0,I love the spanx skinny britches brand. They make smooth look under fitted bottoms.  And not bulky  light.
4.0,"Product is of fair quality for the price. The two longer pieces of cloth are meant to drape over your shoulders, which should make it look like the photo. Once the belts are on, everything should look approximately passable."
4.0,Fits kinda loose
4.0,Very pretty charm necklace band is a little cheap all in all good purchase
4.0,"Love these for my Dino-obsessed toddler! They are comfortable and soft. They do fade quicker than I would hope, and the dino shapes are a little wonky, but we still love to!"
4.0,They are nice but the backs a bit small cannot very tight to the post. I lost an earring the first time I wore them.
4.0,"I like that they're leather. My son has a very wide foot. I always struggle to find him shoes that are wide enough. He hasn't complained about the fit! I ordered the white which are more of a cream color. I would have liked them more white than beige, but they're nice regardless. They run about half a size smaller."
4.0,"Soft inside, fits well. My daughter loves them. We bought them as part of a Halloween costume but she wears them often."
4.0,Although smaller than expected.  I bought this for an 8 yr old and I think she will like them.  In good condition and protected in bubble envelope.
4.0,"Bought this for my 2, almost 3, year old. Originally got the 4T(s) as she typically wears 4t/5t clothes. She refused to wear it because the waistband was too tight. It is a thicker waistband with an elastic that has less give than she was used to so even though it looked super cute on her, I returned it. I ordered the L-XL(6-6x) size because the medium size description had the same waistband as the small, just a longer length. She loves it!! She’s 34 lbs and 39.5 inches tall and the longest layer hits an inch or two below the knee but it’s still really cute. Crazy I had to order a size meant for 7 year olds for my two year old but once we got that figured out it was exactly what we were looking for."
4.0,Beautiful for the money. I gave as a gift. The weight and color was perfect.
4.0,i like the material used to make this dress; its fairly thick. Package arrived on time and in excellent condition.<br />My one set back is the shoulder section... mine is a bit too small like an inch at best could have done some more justice but overall its great!
4.0,"Good quality belt worth the price, to big for me had to make it smaller it cost me another ten dollars to make it to the right size"
4.0,I wish the belt had a hook or something but overall not bad
4.0,Awesome only thing is zipper is way to cheap scared its gonna break
4.0,It’s a cute dress.. if you want to look fresh and casual you can wear a belt so it’s not too loose around the waist
4.0,"These are definately worth the money! In case you couldn't tell, the yellow and black ones that I bought are flat black, not gloss. They are fairly frigile but what else are you gonna get for 5 bucks. lol Recommended buy!"
4.0,Used for pajama day at school for high schooler
4.0,Good product. SMOOTH transition of the toe. Size is good... plenty of room. No break in required.
4.0,"This is a pretty band but it has already begun cracking around the buckle after a week of wearing it. I'm not sure how long the picture will last on the band. Good price, tho!"
4.0,It's s convenient until the magnet grabs everything. Then taking it off becomes tough because of the same magnet.
4.0,Nice cap! Grandson loved it!
4.0,Great looking sunglasses but they do not fit a 10 year old. Unfortunately they were too small.
4.0,Simple but smart looking.
4.0,"This a reasonably high quality strap, especially for the price. Nice and soft, seemingly durable, etc. However, the quick release spring bars are appalling - thin, weak, barely reach the lug holes, and altogether a risky proposition if you value your watch. I immediately replaced then with standard non-quick release bars and now all's good. One more thing: the red is a darkish pink, so be advised..."
4.0,I thought it would be bigger. Perfect if all you want is something to put credit cards into. I am currently using it for business cards.
4.0,fit true to size darker don't show sweat. I like them different colors are nice.
4.0,I really like it but the bands that hold the the extra band length in place are bright white.  Luckily I had some dark ones from another band to use.
4.0,"I love it. I am a size s/m with chubby arms. It fits okay (not the best...), and the sleeves are a bit short (I'm 5'6). It is a bit flimsy but cute, and for the price I'm happy with the quality. It seems like it's one size (no option to choose a bigger size) -- an so I don't think this would fit L/ XL."
4.0,"Socks are thin, not good for winter use if working outside.  Socks stop just above the ankle and seam where white and grey meet has a hole/fabric void."
4.0,Sleeker chain design with nice strength and quality of the chain. Nice yellow Gold color and the 14k finish gives a beautiful look. It s colored stones in the hanging pendant are very nice and fitted perfectly.
4.0,Overall ok. Very thin - which unfortunately means if you are rough with them you rip holes in them.
4.0,Love them! Price was great!
4.0,fitted very good but had trouble with the zipper
4.0,Husband had large calves so they are very snug.
4.0,This model is very tall! I ended up cutting about five inches off of this dress. Super soft good quality though!!!
4.0,"For the price - these are pretty good.  They have expandable hinges in the arms.  That's really good.  There is another brand sold on Amazon I like better that are designed to block blue light from computer screens.  That being said, you will not be disappointing in these.  The upshot of these is that they are compact even in the carrying case.  You can put these in your trouser pocket comfortably."
4.0,Fits better than expected my wife loves them
4.0,"The fabric is nice, it is soft and drapey but not too flimsy.<br /><br />Only thing that kept me from a 5 star rating is that they are very large.  I ordered a medium as I normally wear a size 10 in pants.  These are cut for someone who is very long waisted/tall because I can pull the waist up to my bra line!!<br /><br />Not that I am returning them, they are so comfy I will keep the large pair for lounging.<br /><br />My advice, if your rise measurement is not long, and if you are not model-tall, order a size down.<br /><br />Ordering a size small in other colors!"
4.0,"This scarf obviously goes with many different colors, which is great. It will be great for travel, as it will compliment any neutral wardrobe."
4.0,"I gave this item 4 stars because I really like the necklace and it reminds me to be centered throughout the day. However, I did not realize how large the charm is. I was expecting it to be tiny and dainty, but it is 2-3 inches big. Also the chain that comes with the necklace is a little too long and doesn’t have enough “loops” to tighten enough to where I like to wear my necklace. Other than those minor details, I love the design and the meaning and idea behind it. It’s extremely unique necklace and because of its size I’m going to wear it as an accent piece and focal point of my outfits.<br />Seller shipped item extremely fast and it was packaged well.<br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

4.0,"Love it, light, breezy. Perfect to throw over a bikini"
4.0,"A little thin in fabric, but for summer months should be just right!"
4.0,"All in all, this set is just fine. The shirt is too short for me But, I'm tall so that was kind of expected. The fabric is light and soft. Pants fit great. The sleeves on the shirt are a bit tight as well."
4.0,I love this parasol. It looked great and helped keep the sun off of me at a summer wedding. I can’t wait to use it again!!
4.0,"There is something a little weird about this bikini top. I can't figure out what it is. It feels really flimsy, but it hold everything up where I want it. I bought this in my normal size, 34FF. The band fits well, but the cups are a little large seeming. They seem to keep my boobs pushed inward, so they aren't stilling out toward the armpits. I think it may be where the seams are across the cups that causes this. It feels a little risky, but it looks good. Overall, it's comfy, even if a bit strange. So, I'll keep it."
4.0,its pretty
4.0,My girl looks super awsome in ti.
4.0,"I’ve bought 5 different nursing shoes & these are my favorite.  I have steel blue but may also buy the black ones. I’m in nursing school and work as a patient care tech.  They are Comfy from the get go. The shoe is a little wider than I needed so I swapped out the no-tie shoe strings for the original, tie-up ones and now they fit perfectly!"
4.0,I ALMOST kept this dress.  I bought 2 sunflower dresses and loved them both.  The only thing that made this one inferior to the other was that the fabric is a bit shiny in way that cheapens the look.  It really was cute and flattering though.  I love the faux button panel up the front and the length made it very classy.
4.0,"I have this dress in both the black with white polka dots and blue floral. Same size dresses, but the blue is shorter.  Love the dress, wish it was longer."
4.0,"Nice fit, I get lots of compliments."
4.0,It was even prettier up close! The pictures doesnt do ant justice to convey the elegance of this clutch.
4.0,"Fun mid rings,  however they are a little more brassy then gold when you get them. Either way they are super cute for a great price! Going to order another set!"
4.0,Order 2 sizes smaller than you usually wear. Nice gown.
4.0,"Except for the fit, these guys are warm as hell, and ultra comfy!<br />Just a touch large, but still very glad I got’em."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Perfect for the price. It will need a few alterations, but what bridesmaid dress doesn't."
4.0,"It is 1 size fits all and runs small, so I thought I would be ok. I'm a small/medium and it is just a tiny bit small. I will still keep it and wear it for a $12 cute top, it's great!  I bought another item from Floerns so I was expecting the same quality and this is not as well made."
4.0,Arrived sooner than expected and is holding up nicely.
4.0,"Well made, pretty little hoops"
4.0,"Buyer needs to be aware that item shipped will not be exactly as pictured.  The picture is predominately green and black while the item I received is shades of blue and gold.  While very nice, I ordered because of the item pictured.  There was no notation that the picture is only an example.  Buy needs to be aware that item received will not be the item pictured."
4.0,but still does what I need it to do for my headphones.  I would have given it a 5 if it were bigger.  I'd recommend this to anyone with something small to store.
4.0,I ordered these for my 3 year old and they are great for her!  We both love them. I can dress her fashionably with this little accessory
4.0,"I’ll admit that I waited maybe a week or two after receiving this dress before I took it out of the shipping package.  I just didn’t want to be disappointed if it wasn’t as advertised.  I worried over nothing.  The dress is nice.  The material, a lace overlay, is soft and does not look or feel cheap.  I’m old school so I will still wear a slip under it.  Picked up a few pounds over the last two years, thank you COVID!  So I ordered size 16 and the fit is great.  I wish the sleeves were wrist length, but can see once I went back to the original picture on the Amazon site, that the sleeves on the model do not reach her wrist, so I’m OK with it.  Yes I would recommend this item to others."
4.0,Not crazy about the way watch fits into bracelet.
4.0,Great sock for skiing.
4.0,Gloves are much bigger than size chart indicated
4.0,Bigger than I expected but for the price I'm sure I'll get plenty of occasions to wear.
4.0,"So it’s good but the clear strap.. you’d have to figure out how to fit it around your feet. It’s easy to hook up to the sandals but even tho I tied it to the tightest, it doesn’t sit right around my ankle. No instructions but the size of the sandals is right tho."
4.0,Bought for my Amazefit. I expected it to be Mike the web-style NATO bands. But it’s much thicker and it is surprisingly comfortable. Only had it on e watch barely a week now but so far I like it. The little tools (baby star-drivers) do a lousy job loosening the pins to remove the original strap. I had to buy cheap small needle nose to get a grip to unscrew the pin heads.
4.0,Bought this as something to sleep in and it works great. Very comfortable.
4.0,Cute and trendy!
4.0,Not really a gray more like a taupe color but it matched my brown couch so I could live with it.
4.0,"This coat is not very thick, so if it's a cold night you'll need something warm underneath. the 2XL was  a just fit. If I had ordered a 3XL it would have been too big. The coat held up well all night and I will be able to wear it again."
4.0,"Since this is a body suit, I recommend buying a size larger. It fit great but needed a little more room."
4.0,This shirt was a bit small but it's still a great buy! It's perfect for a shopping trip or a quick trip to the gym. I would have given it 5 stars if it were a tid bit larger.
4.0,"This came in on time, was package very nicely (like a gift box really) and fits everything + that I intend to use it for. I can even fit my keys in it. I would consider this a perfect everyday, grab n' go clutch. License, bank cards, insurance cards, cash (including a zippered change compartment), another area for maybe coupons / receipts / etc., phone and a 2nd phone - or in my case, keys. Also has the handy wrist strap for carrying not to mention the added protection of the RFID.<br />The only reason I am not giving a 5 star rating is I could have swore I ordered this in the burgundy option. It arrived in black. Still a very nice clutch that I will be using... just not in my favorite color."
4.0,Sizing is a bit small. Nice jersey though.
4.0,Love this but the one shoulder strap was sewn twisted.
4.0,"Nice, comfy hat!"
4.0,I ordered an XL and fits good . I thought it’ll be too small . I have room if my weight goes up because I tend to fluctuate..I’m 5’4 1/2 & 186lbs
4.0,Well-made and attractive. Thick leather with no holes may last longer than most leather belts.Classy art deco buckle.
4.0,Fits my daughter nicely. Would buy again
4.0,"Great quality, thick fabric"
4.0,"Heavy-duty, frames are strong."
4.0,"I kind of figured it would considering the price, but the dress in the photo appears to be much higher quality than what arrives. That being said though, I really like the dress and am definitely keeping it. It has a nice length so that I can wear it to the office and not be concerned about it being appropriate or not."
4.0,"Size: I got a large, and I'm 5'3, 180lbs, 38c bust. It fits perfect and even a little roomie in the middle, but that's what the side ties are for. On that note, mine didn't come with anything to use as ties so I'll have to go buy my own, and that's the only reason this is 4 stars. The print is actually embroidery, not print, and the material is legitimate sweatshirt material, not the cheap artifical feeling a lot of cosplayaterials have."
4.0,It was spandex material so you do want to get a size smaller for any jumpsuit!
4.0,Very nice for the price.  A little smaller than I anticipated.
4.0,Como me lo esperaba.
4.0,"I love the jacket, and it’s pretty thick. Just wish the hood had a little bit more room."
4.0,nowhere near as oversized for someone who wears a us 4xl but still pretty comfortable
4.0,The band is nice but I think its too small for the Versa 3.
4.0,"Looks beautiful on my daughter, but it did need to take it in a bit in the torso."
4.0,I ordered a half size up when I saw they were smaller than normal. They fit great and they are as comfortable as any other flip flop I have worn. One of the straps on my right foot keeps rubbing against my pinky toe but its not too bad. No blistering and it doesn't hurt.
4.0,I’m size 8 or 8 1/2 and other brands’ socks go to 9 or so and usually they became too large for me. However this product’s size chart just go up to size 8 and that’s perfect for me.
4.0,"Buen producto, recoje todo."
4.0,It’s a slippery slightly clingy material . Still cute and I love the sleeve length - not too short . Versatile shirt. Could we worn alone or under a denim jacket. I’m sure I’ll wear it a lot .
4.0,Very pretty but it does not lay flat never wore so as for the color changing I am not sure how long it will last before that happens so hope it will last awhile
4.0,Great for traveling..
4.0,"I ordered the Shell color (Starlight). It looks nice for a resin band. However, it didn’t come with the tool to remove links. Fortunately, I had one from when I a ordered a similar resin band from “HOPO” on here. The links are easy to remove/replace for adjustment."
4.0,The fur is very pretty and quality is good. Only issue I had was that it's a little small.
4.0,"This is a cute shirt. I was execting it to be a little more adult looking. It is not really childish. But to me reminds me of the lolita style of clothes. It is not a bad thing. I have the perfect ouft and places to put it in my wardrobe, it just is not going in the section I was anticipating. It is definitely chiffon and will take the care of such. No getting around that on this piece. Realy light weight and comfortable. I am a medium. Large b cup, ordered a medium, and it fits. Does not pack well. When I received it, you could tell it had traveled it is chiffon so if you travel be prepared for that. Also, the pink is a little sheer, so a cami maybe necessary . i received this product at a reduced price or free in exchange for anhonest review."
4.0,"The black one fit perfect so I ordered the white and tan color.  As you can see in my picture the white one was single layer looks cheap and see thru, the tan is double layered better quality.  I am 34C  5’5” 135lbs got them in size small which fit just right. Probably could have gone with a medium for reference."
4.0,"Super cute, dainty, feminine earrings and I love them! So glad I purchased these.<br />They don't always stay put but not a big deal at all. It's mostly because they don't completely tighten onto my ear, but like I said it not anything anyone should worry about."
4.0,"The key rings are the prefect size for you keys and other stuff. I attached one to my dogs leash for her poop bags, and a each house key for our walks."
4.0,"Instead of looking more like a school girl I look more like a school marm!  For once something is way too big!<br />Granted I have lost 5 lbs, but don't think that I have worn it since I first got it.  It is super soft and very nice feeling I just wish that it didn't feel like a sack hanging off of me.  If I had known to buy a smaller size (we all get busy reading reviews of several different items and can get them confused or the same company makes more than one item and they fit differently).  This black with the white collar is pretty, soft, comfortable, but if you are in my size range 5'7"" and 170 I would buy a large and possibly even consider a medium if you want it a little snug."
4.0,Only issue I had was that there was a little fold mark nextt to the symbol. After wearing it a while it eventually faded. Other than that it is exactly what I wanted.
4.0,Nice it is one piece but very pretty
4.0,"Lights worked great, however hat arrived smashed in a bag"
4.0,"This is surprisingly a great strap, from its design to the comfort of it. The only reason why I’m giving this a 4 star review is that it’s sort of slippery. For example, I was playing an imported telecaster (it’s fairly light for me) and the guitar neck kept diving down because of how “slippery” the strap was. Again, this is a great strap, but that one issue is my only gripe with it."
4.0,"I followed the advice of other reviewers who said it ran a little small, so ordered a Medium. It's a bit big but I can make it work. How the heck are you supposed to attach the chain and keep the ends under control??? Overall, it sure seems like quality construction and looks authentic."
4.0,they r so cute they just arrived and it came with a lil bag but sadly they will tarnish and make ur finger green eventually :(
4.0,"the zipper is a little tight, but that probably helps is protect the contents...very nicely made.  The leather is also nice."
4.0,"This top is very cute but not durable or color-fast. Hand-wash on use the delicate wash setting with woolite to keep it for more than 5 washes. If it wasn't so cute, I would have given it 3 stars."
4.0,Great product! Came in handy for our recent trip
4.0,"I like it but it comes a little small, I have thin wrists but  it still is a little tight. Its very cute though."
4.0,"I really like this purse, however, it is a bit smaller than I would like it to be. Special features I like are: the multicolor rich looking leather,  pockets on either side, flat bottom, zip pocket inside & sleeves for credit cards. The top opening is not very wide so items have to be organized well to grab them, like sunglasses, keys, etc. While I no longer like to carry a large purse, this one is a tad too small to hold the minimal items I need to carry."
4.0,Classic top. Something you can always grab and will look good.
4.0,Got this as a gift for a friend. The pendant was pretty and we'll made but the chain/rope thing is cheap and not made well. We just put the pendant on a real chain and it was perfect after that.
4.0,Don't know but assume it works as shown.  Seller delivered as promised
4.0,I expected more padding in the foot sole part of the socks. Not as comfortable as expected.
4.0,Very nice and as described.  I am returning because the material was thinner than I had expected.
4.0,So far seems to be very nice.
4.0,Came off a little to easily. Very pretty when they are on.
4.0,This runs small in my opinion I usually wear an XL for workout because I like a looser top since I wear fitted leggings- nothing about this top was loose on me. Comfortable material and very breathable but size up if you don’t want a fitted look.
4.0,cute outfit at a great price!
4.0,Not as big as I thought it would be but I love it
4.0,I got very confused and was leaning toward returning it when I realized I had it on backward.<br /><br />Don't do that.<br /><br />Put it on the right way around.  It fits much better and makes you feel cute.<br /><br />Not as baggy as I thought it would be but still baggy enough.  I'm going to be excited to wear this when the weather permits.
4.0,Got so many compliments when I wear this dress only downfall is it's a little itchy under the arms.
4.0,As advertised. Comfortable watch band
4.0,Very cute but would have expected heavier cloth for this brand & price
4.0,Its my go to everyday watch. I like the style.
4.0,This product is really nice sound quality is decent enough for my purpose. The only problem is the original battery only last about 7 hours for me. So I hacked it and put in a 450mah battery. It now lasts longer than I do. Not necessarily recommended though. The light on it also needed to be covered up with some tape. But overall I absolutely love it and would purchase again.
4.0,Fabric is not the best but it’s cute
4.0,"This is a cute, everyday sweatshirt for a toddler girl. It runs true to size. The 3T size fit my 3 year old perfectly. I did have some color bleeding on the wrists that won’t come out. But it’s relatively minor. The fabric is ok- not thick or really soft. But the shirt’s quality is expected for the price. My daughter and I both like the bright colors. So overall I’m happy with it."
4.0,Pretty nice for the money.
4.0,Bought one for myself and one for my son fits well and received several compliments
4.0,Dont shy away from this set because of the low price.  I recently wore this to a party with a pale green silk blouse.  I got complements and noticed others looking at it.  It may be &#34;cheap jewelry&#34; but it sure look GOOD!  My real pearls would not have looked better. Think I'll order the bracelet.
4.0,"The price was good, I hate how it feels when water is under the band. Also fading a little on the underside after two months  but not enough that I wouldn’t buy it again"
4.0,nice socks - good deal
4.0,The back broke off after 2 months
4.0,Good quality. Colour was not as expected.
4.0,These socks wonderful. I can feel a huge difference after working 12 hours if I don't wear a pair of them
4.0,Good top.
4.0,"Fully as good and as warm as comparable items that Land's End and L.L. Bean sell for $80, but at a faction of the cost."
4.0,The bottoms cut into my butt a lil bit
4.0,"These shorts look just like the product photo - except that the closure is visible.<br />I normally wear a Medium and these shorts in Medium are very tight.<br />I think I would want a large or maybe even an XL, for a more casual look.<br />I really like the material on these pants - they don’t wrinkle easily like some of my other paper bag waisted shorts.<br />I wish that the inseam was a tad bit longer - the 3” inseam is just a little short for me, 3.5” would even be better."
4.0,It’s a pretty watch. I thought the meter dail would turn. A little Disappointed in that but other than that it’s OK
4.0,"It was a little snug for a small. And a little heavy for a summer dress, but that’s because of all the pockets and extra zippers. I’ll keep it anyway."
4.0,just beautiful and often have worn it as my wedding band ....
4.0,Very elegant top
4.0,"Decent for the price. Seems hardy - which I like. Don't want anything delicate for hands that do a lot of hard work.<br /><br />Fit is average. Tad too loose for pinky, so it's used on the ring finger."
4.0,Adorable but thin material
4.0,Love but it’s shorter than expected. Too short for work. But I am 5’ 10”.
4.0,I went for a 3.50 mile job in 60 degree weather and I was really surprise how this jacket 1. kept me warm and 2. how much I actually sweated!  I was not overly concerned that it do not have pockets due to I use a run belt.  I took one star away due to it takes time to dry once you hand wash it.  I actually ended up ordering another to help with that issues.  FYI I am 5'3 145lbs and I ordered an XL.  I like the way if fits due to I can move in it....not too tight and not too big.  Also the two zippers on the side helps to tighten the jacket as well!
4.0,"First of all, the ones that aren’t full price and aren’t Prime, aren’t Hawthorn. Don’t buy those. They warn you. These sell out fairly quickly and different colorways come into stock, so check back often for colors you want. They are cut identically to Lulu, but the fabric falls somewhere between the Wunder Under Luxtreme and the Aligns. (If you get bad fabric it’s because you didn’t purchase the Hawthorn brand.) I wear a 6 in Wunder Under and a Small in Hawthorn. Aligns are stretchier so if you’ve only worn aligns you need to size up in these. Also, if you’re shorter than 5’6”/5’7”, these will be too long. Go to their entry for 7/8 length (25”). I’m 5’8” and honesty these could be longer but they’re long enough (it’s the same with Lulu). Some of the colors smell horribly like chemicals and that’s a no for me (the light tan, whoa). I don’t trust that it’ll come out in the wash. I’ve tried airing them out and  it doesn’t work. Other colors have that faint odor of cheap clothing and that’s ok with me. These are flattering and hide the cellulite seemingly well. They’re meant for working out; I do yoga, weights, walking, etc. I wouldn’t lounge in these because they have some compression. I basically wear these when it’s not worth putting wear and tear into my Lulus (or Alos)."
4.0,"Even though the picture clearly shows the heel is tall, I didn't expect them to be as tall as they were.  And I didn't expect the tops to be so high either. The description says &#34;low top&#34; but they weren't when I put them on.  They fit fine otherwise I just wished the heel would have been shorter. I think I had a different kind of boot in my head when  I bought these and thought they'd fit like high tech's. And I loved the  fact that they were pink!  I like the shoes just have to get use to walking in them.  These arrived VERY late.  They were supposed to be a Christmas present and didn't arrive a couple of weeks later."
4.0,Works well. Stones do fall out eventually but it was worth the money.
4.0,My daughter in law loved her birthday gift. Very nice.
4.0,"The dress was pretty much perfect. Looked exactly like the pictures, color was correct, and the size was perfect. The only thing I can say negative about the dress is that the little jewels were kind of loose so I had to watch to make sure my daughter didn’t pull them off. Other than that we both loved it."
4.0,"Inexpensive felt material, but looks cute and very warm, true to size."
4.0,Awesome shirt!  My boss is a big &#34;Thats what She Said&#34; person so this was the perfect inexpensive Christmas Gift.  Was good quality and true to size.  Happy with the order!
4.0,Look great but hurt like hell
4.0,Wayyyy longer than I expected and it runs large because of the elastic waistband.
4.0,I ordered the large.  They were tight at first.  They stretch and get pretty loose.  I’m happy I kept them.  Very cute!
4.0,"Cute earrings, nice for classier occasions"
4.0,"This is a beautiful bag. I love almost everything about it. The one exception, which has nothing to do with the quality of the bag, is I always insist on having one outside zippered or snap closure large enough to place my shopping list with attached coupons needed for groceries. I also toss a pen in so it is handy at the moment without opening the handbag up. Everything else is perfect. Hope the add this feature."
4.0,"These modern innovations 18 oz tumblers are really quite nice. You honestly have no idea these are not glass until you pick them up! They are made with a SAN acrylic material which is BPA free, break resistant and dishwasher safe. It claims they are shatterproof too and should be like most plastics are. We really like to use them outdoor poolside because you don’t have to worry about any glass breaking and getting in the pool but yet they also do not look cheap and if you having a nice outdoor party it looks like you have nice glasses outside. I don’t think I would use them for fancy dinner parties with guests or intimate meals like the description says but they are great for everyday use and the pool. The acrylic glasses are dishwasher safe which makes them very easy to clean. So far I haven’t noticed and scratches or discoloration from the dishwasher. They do get water spots like lost glasses if you don’t dry them when they come out. I will update my review if these glasses get cloudy or no longer looking like nice real glasses. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
4.0,Battery was dead when received. Replaced and works as expected.
4.0,"I love the ring, I wear it every day and it looks like the first time I wore it, definitely would purchase another one!"
4.0,Small but looks good.
4.0,"Really pretty cover up. The only downside is that the tassels at the bottom aren't secure so they will eventually fall off. I only noticed this because a few of them were on the floor. To solve this, I simply knotted each group of tassels. Other than that, love it!"
4.0,"This is a comfortable strapless bra.  It doesn’t offer a lot of support for those with larger breasts, but it does offer a little bit, making it suitable for casual wear around the house.  Removing the cup inserts also helps to provide a more comfortable fit."
4.0,Really like this . I am 5’1.... nice fabric . This is a tad long on me but it works . Good quality for the price
4.0,These are great long layering tanks. Only disappointment was that the picture shows two and I only received one. Still great tanks.
4.0,The sleeves were larger than expected.
4.0,Needed to replace some older face masks. These fit the bill.
4.0,The hood fit kind of weird on my head. Other than that it was a nice hood.
4.0,I bought this for my wife. The dress fits fine but she says the upper section for the boobs isn’t exactly big enough. She says “I don’t understand what it is with plus size maternity dress makers assuming that you have no breasts!”
4.0,Very smooth material and wide straps. Only thing is I wish the lining was sewn in instead of removable. I removed them as they were clearly visible
4.0,Love the bag.  Perfect size and extremely stylish.
4.0,"I was very excited when I received it but when I felt the strands they felt a bit rough, more like plastic Barbie hair and rough strands towards the top. It's very nice to look at, very big, and I loved the color."
4.0,"wish I had ordered one size larger, still looks good, love the fabric, great for hot summer days and nights"
4.0,Sharp looking brim though I don't care for the stiffness. My old school straw stingy hat (which I still have after several decades) is more flexible and I'm sure would be two to three times the price today! Both Santana hats I own are lined and out beat any other at twice the cost which aren't lined. Thank you Mr.Santana!!!
4.0,Very sturdy and good quality
4.0,"The sandals are comfortable,but cut is more for a males foot than a female. Sandals are super wide, Diffenitly not for a woman's foot."
4.0,"its big, but i like it"
4.0,"I love using this bag. It's so cute and exactly what I was looking for. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because of the smell. When I first unboxed the bag, the smell was horrendous. It's since aired out (quite a bit) but it still has a faint smell. Hopefully, that'll go away pretty soon :-/"
4.0,"Good belt, material feels a bit like rubber at times but good belt for the price"
4.0,Good cheap pair of wayfarers
4.0,I liked the stretchy material and it’s soft and adorable. It does run a bit small but I’m happy with it otherwise.
4.0,Hides your tummy well.
4.0,"It would’ve been perfect if the material would give just a little. My boobs are just too big. Regrettably, I have to send it back."
4.0,"Size is terrible. Bought for my teenage daughter, ended up giving to my youngest daughter who is 3 years younger."
4.0,I love these pants. I got charcoal gray and they look great. I am 6’0” and 175 lbs and got an XL tall. They are nice and stretchy. They don’t quite feel like yoga pants but they’re much more comfortable than your average dress pants. They are a bit thin though. I have to wear a thong as you can see your underwear line through them.
4.0,Kids love it but we’ve had to tape cover the speaker so it’s not so loud. I can hear it in their upstairs room from the kitchen downstairs. Even though it sometimes scares them they insist they love it and continue to want to use it!
4.0,The product is good and works as it is intended. I usually take a large in most clothing but bought medium and it fits perfectly
4.0,"Strong smell of rubber and greasy, is more for industrial work"
4.0,"Great wallet.  Better than the standard metal ones.  Nice to have outside money holder, no slip or loss of bills.  Good for the person who keeps wallet in front pocket."
4.0,"My 7-year-old had the time of her life this past Halloween. I was frustrated with the wig like a lot of other reviewers but she was oblivious to why I was so frustrated. I buy wigs and to be valued at that was in the top two of worst wigs I have ever encountered. It arrived in a plastic bag with the costume with no net to prevent the massive fly -aways. It was poorly stitched. There was a lump in the back of the wig caused by some sort of plastic. I couldn't cut it else there would leave a bald patch in the wig so my daughter scratched at it a lot. The hair was barely maintainable. Especially after wearing it to 1. The church trunk or treat (a two-hour outdoor event I had to revive the wig when we got home 2. the school costume parade then class party (essentially wearing it all day at school) and 3. Trick or treating.<br /><br />Still, she said she felt amazing and it was the 43rd best day of her life. The rest of the costume the top and pants are screen-printed polyester top and bottoms. It looks textured in the photo like there is more detail in the outfit, but there is no belt or zippers on the jacket. The dragon symbol is attached by a square inch piece of velcro but seemed to stay on the costume fine. Nothing ripped after all the use."
4.0,See Add a headline
4.0,"Arrived on time. Loved the watch, but it runs small. Will have to give to someone else. I've updated to 4 stars because of the excellent customer service from the seller."
4.0,Looks good but easy to scratch them.
4.0,Very light and comfortable. Loved it
4.0,"Hard to give a complete review, since my daughter has only worn them for a couple of games so far. But she seems lo to really like them. They're light and comfortable and the fit is good."
4.0,"These boots are unique and fit perfectly! I have difficult feet to please because of bunion surgery years ago, but these did the trick. They are a fun red color and I wear them with dresses, jeans, and pants. People love them and compliment me on them all the time. They have good traction for the icy, snowy climate. I live In Northern Utah so that is important. I do not always want to wear snow boots because I am not always playing in the snow and these fit the bill. Would buy from this company again. disclaimer-does have a strong odor when you open, but it dissipates after a day or two."
4.0,I really like the quality. Not cheaply made. It is a little larger than excepted. Ordered a large but could've used a med.
4.0,"This is a very useful light-weight backpack when all you want is something to carry a few clothes, books and basic stuff.  My husband sometimes works as an extra on movie sets and this was exactly what he needed to carry some extra clothes and stuff that he frequently needs.  It doesn't have many pouches.  There's a pouch on each side on the outside, and a slot on the inside.  There are no zippers but there is a drawstring on the top outside to cinch the main bag up.  I like that the shoulders that are padded and the back is padded making it comfortable to wear.  It's water resistant and has couple of long reflective strips on the front.  I don't know what this backpack costs, but if it's less that $25 I will raise the star level from 4 to 5."
4.0,"This top runs a bit small. I ordered a medium to be safe. I purchased in green and it’s very cute. I wish it was a bit looser. Paid $10 for a cute tee, so I can’t complain! The color is great, it’s soft and washes up well."
4.0,"Okay, so if you aren't sure what size to get, size up, they run kind of small. I couldn't tell from the pictures that the over the foot part is not adjustable (it's probably obvious if you read through the description better or look at the pictures closer, I dunno). With that in mind, I usually can wear a 6-7 in women's shoes, I ordered the 6.5-7.5 but because the top doesn't adjust they wouldn't fit if my feet were any bigger. (For reference, I don't have wide feet either). But, the color is pretty, they are exactly what I hoped for, something to slip on and wear around the house. We have two big German Shepherds so even if I swept constantly there would be dirt and hair all over and I hate getting all that on my socks, these prevent that. I would buy these again for sure, I would just size up in case I had fluffier socks on they wouldn't end up being too tight."
4.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; and curvy, and this was a little shorter than I'd like but, not unwearable. I can't say I would wear it without tights. Overall, its decently made and what I was looking for, for a fraction of the price."
4.0,Very pretty but looks silver not pink
4.0,Very comfortable sock and surprisingly warm for the thickness.  No bulky fit or uncomfortable seams.  I'm not a fan of &#34;high socks&#34; but would like these to be a bit higher (1 - 1.5&#34; higher) to keep my pant legs from rubbing against my upper ankle area.  Aside from that these are fantastic socks!
4.0,"It shows way more cleavage (okay, everything is exposed) than the pic shows. The stitching is good. The pattern on beige/pink that I ordered is very forgiving (for my body and for alterations). I had to cut about 4 inches off the length. I'm 5'2&#34; and wanted it as a house dress that was a few inches above my ankle. I took the portion I cut off and sewed it to the chest. It's good now. In fact, I love it now. I like that it has a lining so I can go get the mail without flashing everyone."
4.0,"Comfy, cute skirt that zips well and leaves enough room to tuck in a tee, sweater, or bodysuit. Really flattering. Fabric is a bit on the thin side but the quality is pretty alright."
4.0,I was so happy to get this bracelet to be worn with my starfish  necklace.  It was a good match.  My wrist is a small ; so i was able to adjust it for my size.
4.0,I use these to walk in. They tend to need pulling up from time to time. I love the pockets.
4.0,Has a moccasin feel. Great for light snow conditions. Not too comfortable on hard floors and cement. The soles are extremely flexible and easy to clean. They keep your feet dry but not warm. Not good for deep snow conditions. Nice looking boot. Do not step on chunks of ice; you feel everything through the sole.
4.0,I really like this sweater & have gotten compliments on it when I wear it.  The only thing about it is it wrinkles very easily.
4.0,My daughter loves these. Her father and her mother are worried. Heeleys are not the safest of products unless you wear a helmet.
4.0,Works good. There are probably similar products out there that do the same for a little less.
4.0,"I originally bought the pink colored glasses and love the fit and size and no slip during tennis. But someone told me yellow lenses are better for playing tennis, So I bought the yellow lenses/sided one called “micks cash” or something similar. They unfortunately did not feel quite as nice and also are a gawdy gold color both lenses and sides. They feel more like convenient store $5 glasses.<br />I am still enough of a fan, I may find a local store selling them when I buy another pair so I can see them ahead of time."
4.0,Very nice. Not recommended for girls with big bubbies
4.0,"Took these to Santa Fe last Christmas but snow was sparse and I had an orthopedic boot on, so didn't give them a thorough trip, but there were comrtable."
4.0,Was expecting it to be a tad bit tighter but oh well. Biggest complaint is the gun pocket should be more secure. Otherwise very nice and comfortable vest.
4.0,"Size 12 foot and these fit a little tight to begin.  Loosening up slightly, but still tight."
4.0,"I ordered this water shoes to do paddleboard. They arrived on time, and they are comfy, but a little large. I ordered as the &#34;size chart&#34;, but I should ordered &#34;Large&#34;, instead &#34;XL&#34;. Thinking to order another pair, and give the first ones as a gift.<br />Let's see if I can use the next ones."
4.0,"Great wallet that holds a surprising amount for its size. The zipper is difficult to slide, but try rubbing soap or Vaseline on it. Did the trick!"
4.0,"Muy lindo el vestido, me gustó mucho , talla muy bien, solo que tiene un defecto en el momento de poner los complementos por favor Amazon revisar la mercancía antes de enviar"
4.0,"Cute dress. I got a lot of compliments.  Elegant.  Not well made, but then again, I only wanted something to wear once or twice and the price was very low."
4.0,Gift to my sister. She was pleased.
4.0,"This is a pretty kimono that's made of 100% Polyester - machine washable but line dry only (it feels too delicate to go into a washing machine so I'd rather hand wash it). If you're petite, it will be so long as to hit your ankles, but if you're tall and willowy, it will look great. It's one size fits all because it's flowy. I would have liked a belt to go with it because it felt almost too loose. The design is of palm leaves and bushes, so it's clearly made for a resort. The colors are a little odd - more light blue, red, white and black. For some reason this color scheme reminded me of the old fashioned 3D posters where you had to look through red and black glasses to see the effects. It's nice but I would have liked green to make it not seem so dark.<br /><br />It's sheer so you can use this as a swimsuit coverup as well. Overall I think it's cute and perfect for the summer weather."
4.0,I love picture colour and notice see pick up easy.
4.0,"Awesome ties! Fit great, just have to tie the knot pretty tight for the excess to reach the strap on the back."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:1e4d0646bd57ee466ea9a4872c97c938]] Let me be clear, this little jumpsuit is a good price and it's cute but it just doesn't quite do it for me.  I decided to return it because it's just not feeling like I really love it.  It is very comfortable and as I said in my video - it feels like I'm wearing pajamas.  I got a medium and I'm 5'4 and 110 lbs.  It may be the right fit for you, it just wasn't the right one for me."
4.0,I like the compression fit so that when I’m upside down in class it doesn’t ride up my back it’s s fine basic tank. The polyester is a little shiny which is not my favorite look but easy compromise for inexpensive workout tank
4.0,"I wear mostly blue colors so I ordered this bracelet when I saw this on Amazon. It arrived today and I was so excited to open it. The bracelet is as shown with one exception. The heart is not blue/green. It is ruby red. I checked my order and I did order the bracelet with a blue charm. I found no mention of the red charm, Today it says the bracelet is unavailable. I just want you to be aware of the color change. Otherwise the bracelet is beautiful."
4.0,"Have had them a week and they are still holding together, more than you can say for a lot of things these days. Bought one size larger than I wear in shoes and they fit perfect, that was good advice in earlier reviews. Not much else to say, warm and appear to be well made, hopefully they will survive some real usage around the farm.  jb"
4.0,"I normally wear men's large T shirts and women's 2X, pants size 14/16.  I ordered the 14 plus and it fit great in the chest and throughout the torso.  It is a great pattern and looks great on.  The only issue is that because of the asymmetrical hem it is very short in the back (especially if you have a large bottom).  I have to wear it with an under skirt or with leggings."
4.0,These are cute and all but I think they run a little big. My daughter really like them but if she doesn't wear socks they slip off her feet and to be honest....these shoes do not look good with socks!! For the price I am keeping them until her feet grow a little more.
4.0,I really like it it's nice and sturdy when it came it didn't smell like weird plastic it wasn't squished or anything and it's really pretty but the zipper broke to where I cant close it and I can fix it but I really upset about it
4.0,"love the sunglasses and the case, however no microfiber lens cloth was provided... not sure who's responsible for it, but that's the star lost.."
4.0,Very nice.  Quick delivery
4.0,"They are fine for the money at least what we pay in the US,  but ran large on me and I'm 5'4 130lbs"
4.0,Great quality. Pleats in picture are exaggerated. Skirt of dress lays flat. But overall love it.
4.0,"I love this robe. It’s exactly what I needed for getting ready in the morning. All my kids barge into my bathroom while I’m doing my hair and makeup and my bathrobe is just too hot & heavy sometimes. The color is great. I love that it has pockets. It will need retrying if you move around a lot in on so it’s not going to stay put if you’re particularly active in it. I want to get it in another color.<br /><br />Update: I got it in another color. My first one has held up well, I wanted a backup for when my other is in the wash."
4.0,"The Pumiey I bought before were thin, stretchy and silky. Returned to get the Pumiey I bought before."
4.0,"Fits as expected, but only 4 stars as this design would be even better if the cat were a little smaller, just slightly bigger than life, instead of twice life size."
4.0,We purchased this for a girls dress she is wearing in a wedding. This adds a little bit extra fluff to the dress.  Good product. Hard to iron
4.0,"Look good, could be more finished on frame"
4.0,Very stylish.  True to fit. Comfortable.
4.0,"Be prepared to shove these through your ear haha, it gets easier every day tho...<br />They all look very nice, but for the white one with lines, mine came mostly black. And the those greenish ones have a small chip on one side, that's not a problem tho. And I got some dark green ones too, not the all black... And I have one missing in the pic because it was already in my ear"
4.0,I use these for driving my wheelchair.  Helps prevent blisters on my hands.  I just wish it had come with washing instructions.  Hand wash???  Air dry???
4.0,"I liked the dress . Although it was cheaply made it served a purpose for a 5 hour wedding and I got lots of compliments on it. on the model it looks shorter than it actually is it went to my knee. but other than that fit my waist, bust and hips perfectly and very comfortable"
4.0,"My son loves the slippers, they just run small so we wont get as long out of them as I hoped"
4.0,My daughter loves this. It was a little bigger than expected though!
4.0,"good condition, just a bit too large for her"
4.0,"Definitely for a kid or someone with small hands like me. This was surprisingly super small. Other than that PERFECT! Looks exactly like in the pic. Idk if it'll turn my fingers purple after a while from being too tight but beauty is pain 😂 jk.  Also, just a tip for y'all: all fake jewelry should be coated with a clear polish or top coat in order to prevent discoloration and keep it for as long as u'd like. You're welcome. :)"
4.0,"The only thing that I didn't like, i was that it's too short. But I fixed it & it's good."
4.0,Cute shirt and decent shipping time. Item runs small.
4.0,Looks awesome! Great value for the price.
4.0,"This dress blew my expectations! I’m a taller girl... flirting with 6’ and long dresses are NEVER actually long on me so I really expected this dress to be the same. To my surprise it actually grazes the ground like a long dress should! The sequences are beautiful and the dress itself is very comfortable. The under-slip part is about 5” shorter than the sheer part of the skirt but I don’t mind that.<br /><br />It also came super quick! Only took about 2 weeks. I ordered this dress with a couple months to spare since it does come from China. I was really excited to have it already delivered to my mailbox.<br /><br />However, I’m giving this dress 4  stars because the top doesn’t look like what’s in the picture...as another review before me said, it is sewn pretty high up. I appreciate the fact that there isn’t as much boob showing on me than in the picture but it is a little awkward with how much is sewn up. I would prefer it to be like the picture. There isn’t a way to seam rip and bring it down either...kinda stuck with the awkward neckline.<br /><br />With that, I’m still very excited for this dress. It’s the perfect dress for a fall family/maternity photo shoot. You can’t beat the price."
4.0,"I purchased this to keep my Swiss Army knife on my keychain and have the ability to detach it easily. It definitely holds the weight well and detaches as intended for the 10 weeks of heavy usage. I had to drill out the hole on the female side to fit my keyring right, but that isn't the products fault that my key ring is to thick.<br /><br />It does seem unnecessarily long. Especially for my usage. That is why I haven't given 5 stars. If I ever find something shorter I will switch."
4.0,I do like this product and plan on using them on crafts and jewelry.
4.0,"A few things you need to be aware of before you pick up this particular strap.<br /><br />1. It is about 10 inches long, much too short for my wrist.<br />2. It can look like grey and blue in half the lighting conditions when I wore it.<br />3. No, it’s nowhere close to the quality of the $150 Omega strap, which is much more tightly woven and sharper.<br />4. Comfort is above average, like most natos.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a high tightly woven nato that is about 12 inches long. Check our Phenomenato. Google it. It’s from Europe, costs about $45, tales a few weeks to ship, and you will actually feel it’s money well spent. Good luck."
4.0,"Product is beautiful. Exactly what i saw in the picture. However, the zipper is a little tricky."
4.0,"The cap was good quality. My son loves it. But....the rivets fell off right after he opened package. I suggest a different way of adhering the rivets to the cap. He wanted to keep it, so I sewed metal buttons where all the rivets fell off. He still loves the cap."
4.0,Not as easy to get on as shown on TV. Comfortable. She not be advertised as easy on and off.
4.0,Very comfortable. Perfect color for fall. It stretches so small fit but could have probably gone with medium.
4.0,"I wish it would spray less product with each squeeze of trigger, a finer mist. I spray CA glue accelerator which is pretty expensive."
4.0,Good fit and very comfortable. First pair of these that I actually like.
4.0,Cute the skirt quality was better than I expected. Was a little big but I definitely like the dress
4.0,super cute but the strings from the top are a bit too long
4.0,"These are beautiful earrings, just a bit bigger and heavier than I was expecting. They're perfect statement earrings, though."
4.0,i love it  but its very delicate .<br />i have to be careful not to break it where the screws attach to the lens.<br />its already starting to crack and it hasn't been a month
4.0,I finally received two distinct deliveries of these flip-flops.  They look like excellent value for the money.
4.0,"Great bag for the price. The inside is unfinished leather which is ok but I would have preferred that the top edges be finished as are the handles and strap. The two zippered compartments and two pockets inside work well for my makeup, phone, keys, etc. This a great replacement for the tattered D&B I’ve been carrying for almost 10 years. I hope this one lasts as long."
4.0,"Son bonitos,"
4.0,"I bought this dress because it was labeled long. I am 5'11&#34; and it barely reaches the middle of my shins. It's super cute and really soft, but not nearly long enough for someone who's really tall."
4.0,"The gold metal on the v neck and the drawstrings, I removed. It made the dress look cheap. But as another reviewer said, luckily they came off easily."
4.0,"Let me begin by saying I *LOVE* the Ekouaer pajama/nightgown line of clothing. It's mostly modal, so be advised that while it's not see-through, it will cling to you so you can see the details around your boobs. That's important to know if you're buying for a teenage girl who wants to walk around the house without drawing attention to herself.<br />Out of this particular line, I bought the kind that looks like a long polo shirt. I like it very well to walk around the house in, but it tends to bunch up around the neck when I'm sleeping. I guess because there's a lot of fabric there compared to a simple ""O"" neckline.<br />I'm just under 5'2"" about 115 pounds and can wear a medium. I tend to size up in nightgowns but have found that I can either stick with a medium with this line and it'll fit with room. If I had sized this one up, there would definitely be too much collar fabric to bunch up around me while I sleep. I will likely stick with simple collars but will still stick with this company because their clothes are SOOO comfortable."
4.0,Worked well on recent trip.  My only complaint is fabric seemed to get stuck in the zipper easily.
4.0,It was just what I ordered and what I wanted. Thank you
4.0,Cool watch for the money spent.  It had little smubge on inside of cristal.  Not bad though...
4.0,"Man. These are paper thin. Like linen, but thinner. Like one ply toilet paper. I wear tights under them and helps though. I'm also about 5'4 and 150 and I've got a lot of junk in the trunk, ordered a large. They're a little small in the booty region. Kinda scared they're going to rip. Not my best purchase and tbh a little mad."
4.0,I have another of the Helikon Tex boonies but of the Soldier 95 line and the CPU line is slightly smaller than those.  The CPU boonie is a very well constructed and designed hat with a sweat band in the front where most of my sweat seems to permeate the fabric.  I wear a 62 cm (7 3/4 inches) hat and this fits slightly small but not uncomfortably so.  Luckily I have a hat lock so as to keep it from shrinking after washing.
4.0,"It’s ok, not the best but it works."
4.0,Son lives the feel and fit. Going to buy more for my hubby next.
4.0,"more studs than originally shown, kinda tacky but cute"
4.0,"It was a little small in the waste, but my daughter was between sizes so I went with the smaller. It was a lovely dress on though."
4.0,"I loved the jacket, but the XL made me swim in the jacket. I am 5’1 185 with DDD. Still way too big and I loved it but had to send back."
4.0,"Good quality, however many duplicates..."
4.0,Very easy to install and change back. Looks very nice on perfect purchase
4.0,"They are lightweight and comfy, fit fine on my head. They are for sure polarized! They are kind of hard to look out of though, for whatever reason it kind of feels like I am looking out of a smudged lens (even after I just cleaned them)."
4.0,"This is a great dressy dress. I wear size 12, ordered XL and it fits perfectly. The dress actually shows your waist slimmer than in reality. But the skirt is fluffy and shows hips fuller than they are."
4.0,As described. A little big for my head
4.0,Great quality. I love the pocket which holds phone and/or keys. It’s more like a pair of cycling shorts with extra fabric. Definitely size up. I usually wear large with my previous BALEAF shorts but this one was a little snug. I’ve used it several times and it washes well. I don’t place it in the dryer but it dries up quickly.
4.0,Good fit . Good buy for the money
4.0,Great gift for her.
4.0,Not this Dark red but Vera Nice lipstick red.
4.0,"I love this shirt! Order a size up, the fabric is stretchy but its also the type of stretchy that youd find on an underarmor athletic material- so it fits VERY snug.<br /><br />Otherwise i love the design!"
4.0,It was what I hope
4.0,Very nice child's bracelet
4.0,"This sash is beautiful! It arrived in a great, sturdy little box with another shade of satin ribbon. The only thing that surprised me (and perhaps it was in the description and I just missed it), was that the applique came detached from the ribbon. There are directions as to how to attach it (via iron or sewing), along with a white and a champagne colored ribbon. The applique is beautiful, nice quality. I haven't put it together yet, but I am certain it will be great. Very prompt shipping and they even included a cute gift (an owl necklace with gems on it). Thanks!"
4.0,"I read many reviews stating this coat runs small and advice on sizing up. I usually wear medium but opted for a large due to reviews. It does not run small. I am 5’4 and weight 140lb and it fits quite big, I could have easily fit in a medium-perhaps even a small. It doesn’t look too bad because it has elastics (don’t know what to call it) on the sides which “forms” your figure. Also, the material is thinner than expected. However, it is still nice for a warm rainy weather or could wear layers on cool weather. Will be exchanging for a smaller size."
4.0,They don't fit my face right. But ok for sitting in the sun. I like that they are uv.
4.0,This is a very nice bracelet. The fit is adjustable however it does not go small enough for a 6&#34; wrist. I am able to wear it but it constantly spins around with the beads landing on the back and not visible.
4.0,"The watch works very well and gets the job done! The features are very nice, but the sensors on it can be annoying. I set my alarm to shock me until I perform 10 jumping jacks and there are some times where I’ve done 20 and it’s still active. I’m sure there will be later versions that will be more effective but it’s still great to have, probably should lower the price though"
4.0,Excellent value and although lighter than the eagle creek they seem sturdy. We are big fans of packing cubes.
4.0,"Works well, made a good stalking stuffer"
4.0,Loved how it looked. Gems broke off after 2 months.
4.0,"Shoes are pretty good and comfy for the winter, but I have to return them as they were too large for my toddler"
4.0,"It fits perfectly, it was a great buy for the price. I will definitely buy from them again. It can earlier then expected. The color is very pretty and the design is beautiful but the seams are coming out after one time of me wearing it. Other then the seams i would recommend ordering, its a great and very pretty kimono."
4.0,Fits great except it’s a bit slim at the knees - nice style and durable so far (used for 5+hrs worth of rides). Lots of zip pockets!
4.0,I got this to be Patty Mayonaise for a cartoon character dress up day. Worked perfectly and I will likely wear it again with a more &#34;normal&#34; outfit :)
4.0,"Very comfortable. I have received many compliments. I am thinking perhaps I should purchase another or more, in the event something happens to this one; since I never take it off"
4.0,"These are cute! But the top does range a little small, and I belong in the borderline itty bitty committee. The bottoms are great to cover up that belly pouch, but the top does range a little small! A little bit too much movement can warrant a peek from the ladies. Other than that these do make them look nice!"
4.0,"The only thing that could make this perfect is if it hooked/unhooked.<br />It is a &#34;slide over your head&#34; top. Otherwise, great support, coverage and attractiveness."
4.0,Top part great only snug on the bottom part.
4.0,This necklace is a great gift for any woman in your life. The pearl shimmers very nicely and the sterling silver with white pearl will go with just about any outfit and any occasion. It's dainty enough for a young girl and sophisticated enough for a grown up-- this is the sort of thing that you could get matching pieces for a mother and daughter. Great piece and four stars.
4.0,"runs a little small for an adult, but good quality.  comes with protective sleeve and looks pretty good."
4.0,"Pros:  Nice, light fabric, correctly sized, easy to wash.<br /><br />Cons: None so far."
4.0,"Color is purple, not pink! Extremely disappointed."
4.0,"Disney Pajamas seem to run up to,  2 sizes smaller than expected."
4.0,Really a great stype bag.  There are lots of card holders and just perfect room.  The inside feels a little cheap i hope it holds up.
4.0,Cute ring but the band is a bit thin and flimsy.
4.0,"This dress is very soft and comfortable. It's very large on me, and I am 150, 5'5&#34;, but I enjoy the roominess. I do wear a full length slip underneath it. It is more of a beige than a true white."
4.0,"Wife is 5'5"", 150lbs, size 8.<br /><br />Dress is a true wrap dress so fit is flexible.  The material is a lightweight, flowy poly that is soft and silky to the touch.<br /><br />Color is true to the photos.<br /><br />The dress fits and flows nicely while the subtle ruffles add a feminine touch; this dress is a perfect option for warm weather!"
4.0,"A little tight over the hips, but otherwise satisfactory."
4.0,Adorable. Size up.
4.0,Beautiful. Nice quality and color.  Buy bigger than you need.  Fit is smaller than size says
4.0,Very cute and fit perfectly.
4.0,Okay I got my package and couldn't wait to try them on. It took me a while to get them all opened. I did receive all 20. 10 silver 9 gold and 1 rosegold. There where 2 I didn't really care for so Im gonna give them away. The rest I thought were really cute. Now I don't know what size your nose is but mine is kinda small. I had to stretch 3 of these to get them on. Be careful if you do stretch them you don't wanna just yank them apart. Wish they were packaged differently. I'll post pics of how the looked as well as how they were packaged.
4.0,I like this watch.  Good value for the money.  Two criticisms:  The black patent leather strap just doesn't work with the watch.  It is unattractive and cheap looking.  The dial is not Ice Blue.  It is silver.  A new satrap from Barton is a great improvement.
4.0,"Make sure you use their size chart, not Amazon's size chart"
4.0,"Material seems thinner than other nitrile gloves, but may just be my experience. Also possibly because of the color, which gives an appears of being more thin as you expect w/ anything black you'd expect it to be less transparent or opaque"
4.0,looks good well made great price
4.0,Doesn't last very long
4.0,"Pros: Stitching looks good and is incorporated in the shirt design. Shirt is well-made from 89% polyester and 11% spandex. Simple design. The shirt I ordered (L Navy) fit me well. Comfortable to wear. A Band is sewn in neck to cut down stretch. Decorative red sleeve insets.<br /><br />Cons: I've washed the shirt twice, so far it does not feel silky smooth although the texture is not harsh enough to irritate my skin. The stag logo on the sleeve and the bar design on the back are printed with what feels like a rubbery ink, not sure how this will hold up when washed.  Probably should wash the shirt inside-out. For a form fitting shirt, the sizing chart should have included waist sizes. (I'm a fraction under 6' and wear a 42 long jacket. My waist is 36"", and I am quite happy with the way the L size fits me).<br /><br />Caveat: I am not a connoisseur of fashion nor an aficionada of exercise wear. I walk the dog daily and try to make the gym three times a week but don't succeed consistently. Moreover, I have no desire to be a fashion plate when exercising. My main interest in gym clothes is comfort.<br /><br />The shirt arrived in a zip-lock plastic bag early in the morning. The Maxeria stag logo was attached to the shirt with a pin that opens easily to remove and is easy to put back on the shirt in case of a return. When I first received the shirt, I immediately tried it on to determine whether I would have to return it for a bad fit. Although it was a little tight getting in and out of the shirt, once it was on, I found it a comfortable fit: form fitting yet loose enough that the small amount of spandex easily accommodated my movement. After deciding that I would not need to return the shirt, I found no fabric care instructions packed with the shirt). I washed it in cold-cold (NO FABRIC SOFTENER), hoping to test whether there was any shrinkage, whether the stitching would loosen or pucker, and whether the material would feel softer or smoother.  I was not interested in whether there was any color fading.<br /><br />After the shirt was washed and dried, I wore it for the rest of the day to test its comfort including while walking the dog. I had no problems and often forgot that I was wearing it. However, I've not tested it when sweating heavily to see how well it wicks to keep me cool.<br /><br />Conclusion. I like the shirt, and I am pleased with the way it fits. Although the spandex in it doesn't feel that stretchy, I had no problem with body movement. The fabric was not scratchy enough for me to deduct a full star, but neither was it silky smooth. If it holds up well, I would give it the rating of 4.5 stars. I plan to use the shirt often at the gym and when walking the dog. IMHO, the pictures for the product are an accurate representation of how my Navy L shirt looks and fits.<br /><br />I hope this review includes enough information for you to decide whether this shirt will fit you and fit your needs."
4.0,"I am overall very happy with the shirt. It's a little long in the arms and thinner than I thought it would be, however it is warm. I would buy another color in this style."
4.0,"I have noticed that Amazon tends to group the reviews of products from a single manufacturer together with certain items such as sunglasses. That being said, the model of HDCrafter sunglasses that I purchased surpassed my expectations. I did not have real high expectations because I figured the sunglasses would be what you would expect at their low price point. I simply wanted a pair of sunglasses that looked decent and provided UV protection but were inexpensive enough that I wouldn't stress over misplacing or breaking them. I was in for a pleasant surprise when I received them though. The glasses look great and their build quality is what I would expect from sunglasses costing four times as much. The lenses are a little bit deceptive though. They look very dark yet when you see them they do not darken what you see through them as much as you would think they would. This is both bad and good. Bad if you find that they do not filter bright light well enough. Good if you drive a lot in the early evening because you can wear them longer as dusk approaches. I am quite satisfied with my pair though."
4.0,Cool retro looking shirt with UV protection.  Fabric is light.
4.0,"I like this pair of earrings very much, but am not sure if maybe others have had the same problem - the post section of these earrings seems incredibly thick or big around compared to any of the post earrings and even the more dangly ones I have that use a post with a clip in the back.  I had more trouble getting these posts to go all the way through the holes in my ears!  Mind you, I am in my 60s and had those holes pierced back when I was 14 years old so it's not like they are new!  I do know that over the years the holes in my earlobes are not technically healed, per se.  I can push an earring post in the front hole and poke all around inside my earlobe before finding the hole in the backside of the earlobe.  I mention this because I literally spent 20 minutes sitting on my bed trying to get these ""fatty"" posts to go all the way through to the back hole.  After a while it starts to hurt when I'm poking and poking and poking to find the back hole...and that's what happened with these.  I felt it was due more to the size of the post than my ""floating"" hole in the back.  With a thinner earring post, even if I poke, I usually am able to find that back hole within a couple of minutes.  All I can say is that after I got them in, they looked nice and were relatively lightweight on my ears.  Just think a thinner post size would have made these easier for me to wear."
4.0,My only complaint with this purchase is the lengthy shipping. Otherwise the price is hard to beat and the quality satisfied my girlfriend. Hard to knock it when you look at it those ways.
4.0,Aesthetically it is very nice. The mesh of the watch seems to be fragile. But I think according to its low price it is ok.
4.0,I wish they were a little thicker fleece. I'd give it a 5 star if they were. Over all I'm satisfied though.
4.0,"I love this cami, in fact it is my 3rd one. The seller addressed my concerns with my product. I will purchase again from seller."
4.0,Fit as expected. Comfortable but expensive.
4.0,"This is a lovely dress, however it was too long and the shoulders were too  big making the bodice fit poorly.  This was a size small but I believe the length will still be too long on the XS. The fabric is nice and the print and color are nice, as well."
4.0,"I have these same underwear in a different cut and LOVE them so I was definitely excited to get this style. The fabric is extremely soft and comfortable. The only downside I've noticed with this specific pair is that, even though I got the same size as before, this pair seems a little big. I'm not sure if this is just due to the different style, or what, but either was it isn't super significant and they are still completely wearable. I will definitely be getting more of these underwear in the future in both cuts, I will just be more cognizant of the sizes for each.<br /><br />*I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
4.0,I loved the bracelet but had to return it because of fitment issues.  It was too small for my wrist.  But if the fit was better it would be a keeper. 😉
4.0,"Looks good, comfortable, lightweight.  Easy to dress up or dress down."
4.0,This attaches separate to the watch but then it’s 1 piece. Velcro does make it easy to adjust.
4.0,Very niCe design a little loose for small fingers
4.0,"It is a great wrap. It is tight in the chest area. Im 5'6, 155, 36Dish/38C. I think I got a large."
4.0,"Comfortable as it is elastic and attractive. Time will tell on this one,as ones of another quality wear out due to different placements of the buckle. So far it's good."
4.0,"Fit at the waist just right but the lining on the inside is very tight around my hips. I usually have to push up the lining when I wear it. The fabric falls nicely, and the skirt is still very cute."
4.0,I like the dress it was definitely more sheer than expected but the fit and sizing worked for me.
4.0,"Hat fits, and is well made"
4.0,Plus the downfall is that there is NOT enough material to give you additional heel strap to tighten if too large.
4.0,"Works as expected.  It is really long, which works OK for some sweaters and I suppose jackets.  It is quite glittery, also, but I like a little sparkle so its OK.  The &#34;pearls&#34; join the clip loops with a small wound wire, which slides up and down on the loops so that it never looks straight as shown in the photo."
4.0,"After reading the other reviews, I figured I'd be OK by ordering a smaller size than usual. I generally wear either a 5.5 or 6, so thought going to a 5 would work. Unfortunately, even the 5 was way too large! In other brands, I'd call the fit of the ""5"" to be at least a 6, but closer to 6.5.<br /><br />It's too bad. These shoes looked good, seemed well made and warm, and would likely be very comfortable if they weren't falling off me every time I took a step. If I was planning on only standing in one place rather than walking ... but ... nope.<br /><br />I'm returning them."
4.0,"It's light , it's cute , it's not expensive .<br />On the other side it takes long time to arrive , if you don't like it you keep it because it doesn't make sense to return it to China to get 2$ back and it looks darker then pictured . It's not beige , it's more of a very very light brownish khaki color . Close to beige but a bit off to the darker side .<br />O.k. overall , it's just a scarf , not a 200$ shoes or something ."
4.0,"These are super cute but not that stretchy.  I am about size 4-6 with thin legs. I ordered the one size, and they weren't very easy to get pulled up.  The colors are great but I just got them so we'll see how they do after a few washings.  I'd buy them again, but there are other brands I prefer, if they have cute prints."
4.0,"This collar is absolutely adorable and I love it! It's lined nicely and feels very comfortable to wear. The materials appear to be fairly decent and so they should hold up for a while. My only real complaint is that my neck fits well within the size range, albeit at the higher end, and I expected some snugness, but it's a bit more snug than I would have preferred.<br /><br />Also, just because while browsing for one to buy I saw many reviews complaining about the same thing, I feel like this goes without saying, but this collar and leash are clearly not made for ""heavy play"" nor do they claim to be. There are places to purchase those things if that's what you're looking for. Amazon probably isn't the place for that kind of thing."
4.0,Ok too heavy
4.0,"Really cute, smaller than expected but that’s really more my fault"
4.0,They do the job we purchased them for
4.0,"Nice, light weight comfortable shirt.  Sizes run small, so buy a size up."
4.0,"Cute dress but Looked very frumpy dumpy on me. Im 5'2 , 165 lbs about 8 months pregnant  i ordered a medium."
4.0,"I wore these boots only once for a few hours,so this review will need updating after a few months but so far they seem comfortable,sturdy and great grip on the bottom! Will hope they last!"
4.0,It could be a little thicker but overall it’s good quality and the art work is good.
4.0,"When I got this today, I realized the necklace part would be too small. But it turns out, It was adjustable, To fit any neck. It's perfect, And I'm glad I bought it. My only concern, Is the jade itself is a little too small. Otherwise, Nothing bad to say about it."
4.0,"Maroon dress in medium. Fit very large, but in a relaxed sort of way so it still worked. If it didn't have a hole in the pocket, I'd have given it 5 stars. Very cute dress. Went to an outdoor party in it. A cool date dress to the Farmer's Market on a sunny, breezy day."
4.0,I like this bracelet and it looks like the picture. My charm came off the first time I wore it but I still like it and wear it all the time.
4.0,Cute top runs small though.
4.0,"I bought this dress in both a small and medium as I am currently in between sizes and have to be cautious of my chest (DDD) in dresses for formal events (used this at a wedding). I usually go with medium for formal events because of my chest and overall not wanting it to be too skin tight but the medium was absolutely swimming on me (I am 5'4"" 130lbs). I ended up returning the medium and keeping the small. I will definitely get more uses out of it around the holidays."
4.0,Perfect for my baby.  He is a normal size and I usually have to buy a smaller size for him.<br />But I love the material and it is soft.
4.0,It was a nice suit and delivery was super quick. Nice simple packaging too. Way too small though for me. I think I need to try getting a 2 piece suit instead in a bigger size because I couldn't even pull it up over my thighs to get it on. I like the style and color and it was nice material and was sad I couldn't keep it.  But easy to return as well. You did not offer it in a larger sixe otherwise I would have ordered it again in a size or two bigger but then I think it may have been too big on top . I have that &#34;PEAR-SHAPE&#34; figure unfortunately. Lots of hip and no boobs! LOL!!!
4.0,Really needed xsmall but gonna try to shrink it
4.0,"This is a good quality smaller bag.1 main compartment is made of real cow hide leather, stiff. It is well finished in and out,<br />lining and a small purse are made perhaps of vegan leather and are soft, all is perfectly well matching in color. Great for the price of $10 !"
4.0,"I’ll liked the shorts. But I wanted a little more snug fit around the buttocks area. I’m going to try a couple other brands, to see which fits best. I may come back to these shorts...."
4.0,I am giving a 4 only because I am 5'1&#34; and it was too long until I washed it. Now is an inch shorter and just perfect. Please tell customers about the length. Good quality and keeps me warm. Washes well
4.0,"Great product you get exactly what you paid for, both the packing cubes and bags a great sizes. The zippers are a bit fragile but for that price i'm not complaining."
4.0,"Haven't come yet because of the snowstorm, but I'm positive I'll like them."
4.0,"Awesome shirt, runs big so exchanging for smaller"
4.0,"I was disappointed that the watch is not water proof & it is very cheaply made I don't even think it's shock proof either because when I set the time on it the picture on the time dial moves back in forth also it's not a Disney licensed product it has no markings of disney whatsoever on it, I really like the picture of bambi and his friends on it no other bambi watch I know of has all the numbers on it & I just think the colored numbers are so cute, i'm going to keep it but i'm going to have to take very good care of it not to get it wet but I just really like it it's so cute looking."
4.0,Great wallet and a nice size and feel to it.  Well made and color is fabulous.  Would highly recommend.
4.0,"These are obviously a toy but I ride a road bike and I can now see clearly behind me, checking for traffic, without turning my neck in an uncomfortable position.  I wish someone made these as a legitamate biking sunglass so for now, these will have to do."
4.0,"Fits real nice, and the frame is quite sturdy. The only concern I have is the hinge springs which I believe should be a bit more stronger. Apart from that it's okay."
4.0,"I ordered this bathing suit in black.  I likes that the polka dots are aqua blue.  The color combination is cute.  This dress style bathing suit doesn't look &#34;old lady-ish&#34;.  The open back is flattering.<br />There are a few things that I don't love about this suit.  The first is that the front is cut very low.  As a mom that was looking for a flattering suit I found the cut inappropriate for me.  However, I have a zip up top to wear over my suits for sun protection so I just put that on.  Also , there is not much support in this suit.  The padding  doesnt sit quite right.  I think depending on the length of your torso different people will find that this suit fits them ok while others will find it unflattering.  Overall, it was just ok for me.<br /><br />  I was offered this product at a discounted rate in return for a honest and unbiased  review.  This is the same review I would have wrote if  this product was not discounted. This review is based on my personal experience with this product.

4.0,It is really cute. It ran rather small in the chest area. I even ordered one size larger.
4.0,lovely dress just be prepared to reveal some skin.
4.0,"This is a good singer’s mask. However, my facial structure made the mask too tight across my cheekbones."
4.0,"I knew I would be sleeping most of my international flight, so I purchased these to help with circulation while my body was forced into an awkward sleep position. Im glad I purchased these - they weren't too thick but definitely helped during the flight. Would purchase again."
4.0,It fit beautifully and I was very pleased with the quality.
4.0,son  love it  for his  birthday
4.0,"These are a really thick tight fitting compression sock.  It says if you want a tighter fit to order a smaller size, I don't recommend that.  I ordered the correct size and I had difficulty getting them on.<br />They worked wonderful in keeping the swelling out of my legs which is why I'm wearing them.  In my case most of the edema is from an allergic reaction so there is some very sensitive tender places on my legs and after wearing them for about 9 or 10 hours total when I pulled them off, they were so tight that skin came off in places with the socks.  I'm sure thats because of the issues going on with my skin but just be aware if you already have any breakdown or tender spots on your legs these are really snug going on, wearing them and coming off.<br />They are really thick and I think they will be great when it gets colder but I need for the skin to heal on my legs before I will wear them again.<br />If you have healthy skin and you just need compression socks to help with the swelling these are great.  Just be aware that you need an extra few minutes when getting dressed because they are VERY snug and difficult to get on but they feel good and give good support once they are on."
4.0,Absolutely beautiful and comfortable top
4.0,Love the hat overall and the brim is just right for me.  Be aware that the hat comes folded in a triangular shape and after a week I still can't get the folds not to show.  Simple bending isn't getting the crease out which is why it is getting a 4 rating; otherwise great hat!
4.0,i always order a size larger on here but this time you dont need too. This was very accurate based on size chart provided.
4.0,Love the dress but should have ordered XXL instead of XL.
4.0,"These are so cute and light.. 4 stars because the gold parts are very very cheap. I get these are not expensive but, considering the price and what they probably cost to make, they could’ve done better."
4.0,"Its cute, must iron after every wash and I had to re-sew a button and might have to with all of them just after two washes. Not the best quality but still cute"
4.0,"I love this jacket. It's nice and heavy. I worried it would be light and cheap feeling, but it's got a good weight to it and seems to have been made with good quality sequins. It's made to actually keep you warm, not just look cute.<br /><br />It really does look cute, though. My photos don't do the color justice. This is just as vibrantly as the seller's photos show. More so, even. The green is super neon, and the blue sequins are a complex (iridescent?) color. It's not just a flat blue. It's purple in some lights, and it reflects several colors.<br /><br />It fit me as I expected. I'm 5'7&#34; and about 120lbs. It's big and cozy on me, and the sleeves are just a little long (in a good way), coming down to about halfway down my hands.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this is not actually a hoodie, as it has no hood. Honestly, though, it's so cute and warm that I couldn't give it anything less than four stars."
4.0,Love the shirt! Great quality and cute but I’m a size small and the small in this shirt drowns me. Size down but there is no XS available.
4.0,"Its a bit baggy up-top but if I slide it to the top of my arm it fits just fine. It doesn't really fall down too often so I'm satisfied. I use it to stay warm actually at work since I can't wear arm warmers. Keeping in mind I don't think that, that it's purpose, it works semi-okay"
4.0,This is a very nice looking shoe but I believe it runs a full size small. I have another Sperry Top-Sider in a 9 so I ordered 9 in this and it wasw way too small.
4.0,Great for comfort and warmth in cool weather when going out and about. high waisted gives a little tummy support. Looks great on me lady
4.0,"I absolutely LOVE this robe!! Color and look is just like picture. Fit was perfect. I am using this for my maternity robe for the hospital, but also just around the house and for easy access to breast feeding. I love it, it's silky and soft to the skin. The only thing for me is the material is super thin, so just know/expect that when u buy it. Other then that, it's beautiful, it's sexy and it's a great robe for summertime/spring!"
4.0,awesome to wear if you have to have a covered face
4.0,I gave this product a 4 star as I have not had a chance to actually use it in the sun.  It is attractive and the fit is accurate.  I like the appearance of it and the color.
4.0,The dress fits great! Stylish and comfortable.
4.0,"Hold cuffs securely. Belt attachment works well on either a pants belt or 2.25&#34; duty belt. Perfect if you want a minimalist pouch. Takes some work to get them back in, the cuffs tend to want to collapse when registering."
4.0,"These slippers are comfortable, really. And they have a decent sole so you can go outdoors as long as your neighbors don't see you walking outside in your slippers.<br /><br />I say they are small because I have a 9.5 EEE foot, so my wife ordered these as 11... and they fit my foot perfectly! So if I actually had a size 11 foot... they would probably be way too small."
4.0,"Great Supima cotton fabric and a nice smooth-lined style & construction for a great price! To me, these run a little small - I usually wear a medium in Intimissimi undies, but I need a large in this style, and it's still a little more snug than I'd like because the fabric has a snappier/firmer stretch to it. I like the ones I own and will keep them, but I find their Supima Ultralight Brazilian style much more comfortable."
4.0,Cute. Fits well. Suited my purposes at a great price for Dr. Seuss’ birthday. I will by other colors as needed for other themes because of the great price.
4.0,I gave away as a gift the recipient loved it.
4.0,Great quality for kid's sunglasses. The carrying case is a nice touch for an aspiring sunglass connoisseur.
4.0,"5'2, 170lbs ordered a large and it fit as expected. The length was a little too long so I got it shortened. Received many compliments!!"
4.0,"Due to the pandemic I found myself a little low on comfortable summer clothing and with not able to purchase in person I found myself searching for stuff online.  I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money but wanted something soft and comfortable.<br />The material is very soft and stretchy. The tag said dry clean only; that is a bit of a head scratcher for me, so I just threw it in the washer and dryer like I would other shirt and crossed my fingers and it came out just fine.  I've washed and worn this shirt once a week since I got it is just fine.  I would recommend this for anyone not wanting to spend a lot of money on a casual shirt."
4.0,These masks are comfortable and lightweight. They are 3-ply and so easy to wear. Love the designs
4.0,"It fits ok, but it seems like you have to order a size bigger."
4.0,"Great price for very comfy non skid socks.  The only problem is it's one size fits most and I wear size 5.5 shoes so it was slightly long on me.  It's ok for wearing around the house but when I wore it for pilates, the socks kept turning on my feet when I applied pressure in any direction because it was too loose."
4.0,"For some reason I thought this was going to be a bit bigger than it was, but it's still lovely. Seems solid, and isn't too heavy on the ear. Adds a nice sparkle. Not sure if it's just my ear or what but it sits ever so slightly oddly...almost seems like it would sit better on a second hole (which I dont have...yet). But it's not super noticeable. I've worn it a few times for only a few hours each and there is some tenderness where the cuff sits but it's not, like, actively painful. Not sure I would wear it for more than a couple hours though. The quality seems decent, however another cuff I bought from the same company broke literally as I was taking it out of the packaging (the post came right off), so I'm going to be careful with it. Prompt delivery and good packaging."
4.0,"Its good maybe could have been longer i,m a big guy need more band ,other that that i love it"
4.0,"Love these tiny hoop huggers.  When I am just going casual, they are perfect."
4.0,"panties were requested so that the same color unoco sent them several times remains no complaints,"
4.0,Cute! Came w/ nice shell case & cleaning cloth. Quality decent. Would recommend. Definitely worth $10!
4.0,Love the watch it has a good weight too it the only negative thing Is the bracelet it feels very very very cheap I was going to put a black rubber strap on it anyway.  I'm very happy with my purchase!
4.0,"Was a day late, but may have been weather related... unsure. Loved my hot pink Sanita’s so decided to get these! Color was even better in person! I got a bigger size this time because even with my slim, narrow feet, my pink ones hurt the top of my foot at the end of the day. I thought a bigger size may help, but these were still snug around that area. I am hoping they will stretch out a bit! Also hoping they won’t scratch up as easily as my pink ones :(.<br /><br />Again, LOVE the color! It’s almost like a rainbow effect when you look real close!"
4.0,"They are inexpensive and you have to remember that when purchasing.  It’s not the best or highest quality, but it is a pretty good value nonetheless!  Don’t confuse it with the high end equivalent, but if you looking for value and if it’s something you always wanted to try without committing to a expensive version then this is right up your alley!  I’m not sorry I bought them at all, and now I know I actually would like a nicer more expensive one/set!"
4.0,"Size up a size, maybe two"
4.0,"Watch band only no pins where included, keep your old hardware used to attached band. Took a few minutes to replace. Watch band fit perfectly."
4.0,Smaller than I thought but the smaller size makes it even cuter. It is a great gift for a gator!
4.0,"Cute, comfortable but too large for child"
4.0,"Just like the ones that I wore back in the day! A little bigger than I wanted, bit perfect for my 80's party!"
4.0,True to size. A loose fitting dress no need to  order a bigger size
4.0,Great quality. Size runs a bit small. Fits more like a skull cap.
4.0,"These are very pretty masks. Thankfully we don't need to use them as much as before, however if they are necessary I like to be cute! The quality is good, and they are very pretty. I do find for someone with a fuller face that the aren't comfortable for long time wear."
4.0,These are good but I do wish they were a little smaller!  They are great to use.
4.0,"Very sweet, came quite early. Decent length and width to make a nice bundle when worn, without added bulk. This is NOT an infinity scarf, as some pictures may appear. Love it!"
4.0,"I normally always review items based upon my own experience with and opinion of each item based on its merits.<br /> I am going off my normal course somewhat and considering the advice from a previous reviewer, I did my own research into Bamboo fiber production. I did find similar information with regards to dangerous chemicals used in processing bamboo into soft fabric - the FTC website states soft bamboo textiles are processed into rayon using toxic chemicals.<br /><br />I also discovered during my trek across the textile world, that soft bamboo is not the only textile that is processed using various toxic chemicals but also includes most man made fabrics!  Leaving only a few natural fibers such as cotton, silk, linen, etc ""safe"". Yikes! Based on what I've read I'm really not sure why we are all still walking around.<br /><br />With above caveat, my husband loves these socks and actually told me they were the most comfortable socks he has ever worn.  Not sure how they will launder, he won't take them off!  They are indeed extremely soft to the touch and well made.<br /><br />So should you chose to keep the above Bamboo textile caveats in mind, I leave it up to each individual to decide for themselves with regards to these socks. Husband loves them!"
4.0,"When I first pulled it out of the package a pearl immediately fell off. Thankfully it was free and quick to exchange the item. I only need this for my wedding day so it's a great price, and it looks gorgeous. I wouldn't recommend it though if your planning on wearing it multiple times."
4.0,"Nice fit, however,  I'm 5'7 And the pants come right at the end of my ankles..they could stand to be a little longer, but still nice."
4.0,"These gloves are beautiful, soft, comfortable, and the touchscreen fingertips work fairly consistently. They are not warm however. If you’re not as concerned about keeping warm, I highly recommend these."
4.0,"These little lights can be used as a basic fun item for kids. However I use them for highlihgting trees, and<br />landscape areas Because of the clear plastic body, I am able to tape off the bulb beam and allow the radiant<br />color of the light to emit thru the body. I hide them in my table top projects landscape and grassy areas creating a nice soft highlight."
4.0,"This is cute. I didn’t give it 5 stars for 2 reasons.<br />1.  It’s not quite as large as I thought<br />2.  It’s not quite as colorful as the picture leads you to believe.<br />I bought it because I’m a Leo and the lion is my signs mascot.<br />I do like this very much, however, and would not even think about returning it."
4.0,love the look. the fabric is a bit too flimsy but will look great over my swim suit
4.0,Do work to keep the mask off your face so can breathe a little better.  Wish there was some kind of tap or way to hook to mask. Little side slits don't work well with masks.  If not for nose piece sliding down would have given it a 5.
4.0,"I love this hood!! Its so cute and the fabric is much softer then I thought it would be. The fur is nice and fluffy but it sheds and it smells like plastic. Over time it should go away tho. The shipping was fast but it was a day late which isnt that big of a problem. Im really happy with the ears, as they dont fall down. Im about 5'4 and the length is perfect ♡♡"
4.0,"A bit snug if you have a larger chest, but beautiful dress... Received many compliments and felt great in it. I'm 5'4 138 lbs, length was a little past my knees, slit in back makes it sexy and the tie around the waist is slimming. Great quality for the price!"
4.0,This was a great necklace and I got compliments all night.  The only downfall is that it snagged with the sequence of the dress.  Just be careful with what you pair it with.
4.0,I have 1 out of 2. These are very comfortable just be careful not to snag it. It's pretty useless after that.
4.0,Hangs nicely! Super soft! Material is a little thin. But all around nice dress!
4.0,"I have small hands, so they fit fine for me; but as others have stated, they do run on the small side I think. They are very warm, the touch feature works very well. My only complaint (if any) is that they have an odd texture to the material, and they tend to attract lint, fur, etc. But still very happy with these gloves!"
4.0,I Love these! Adorable.
4.0,Smaller that I thought but super cute!
4.0,Enjoying my leaf earrings.
4.0,It's really nice hat but it fits really big normally there's a little resistance but this pulls all the way down over my head wasn't too happy about that
4.0,I like the wolf and fire but it is not tight enough and you can tell if it is upside down with the wolf
4.0,"I really was excited to try this dress on! I ordered an XL because I get worried with buying online. I wish I would have gotten the large (I am 5' 6"" and 170 lbs). Still works and will be awesome for Christmas! Highly recommend due to the dress' stretchy material and length."
4.0,"A little bad quality of plastic, but they look awesome!"
4.0,Really great fit and liked the style.  The colors weren't exactly as they appear in the photos though.
4.0,Bough for birthday party grab bags. As expected.
4.0,"Bought this because I couldn't find my old weatherproof vintage hoodie. I loved the original one I had, but a huge party of that was because I have a very long next, and the hood had extra length to it so it was actually useful. This one has a significantly shorter hood than the prior hoodie."
4.0,"First off - I really like Citizen's Eco-drive watches with day of the week and date windows plus water resistance to 100 meters.  It's not that I go diving, I don't.  But it eliminates any worry I might have about getting my watch wet, and I like that.  I already have 2 Eco-drive watches, both with  day of the week and date plus being waterproof.  My experience with both of them has been great.  Love the never-needs-winding or battery replacement that I get with an Eco-drive watch, and they are both incredibly accurate.  One is more of a daily watch with a dark black face and gold thick lines for the hours  and the other is more elegant looking with the same basic face except with a white background.  For the last year or so I have been regularly hunting for a 3rd watch that would be different from the two  I have.  On one of my scouting expeditions this one, the BM8478-01L appeared.  I liked it immediately.  I liked the black/blue (depends on the lighting) face and that it actually has numbers on the face of the dial.  And I wanted to try a leather banded watch for a change.  I got it about 3 days ago and have been wearing it ever since.  I would describe it as funky looking.  The face appears large to me and the numbers are definitely not small. This is also the first Citizen I own with a leather band.  My first impressions of the watch:<br />  1.  Big face.  Would not want it any bigger since it would not ""fit"" on my relatively small wrist.<br />  2.  Would not want it any thicker either.<br />  3.  I like the appearance of the face and the large numbers.<br />  4.  The leather band - so far - is pretty stiff.  I am hoping it will soften up over time, but we will see.  If not - I will visit a local watch store and select a leather band that is more to my liking.  I do like the dark brown color of the band however.<br />  5.  It fits well on my wrist and does not move or slide around.<br /><br />The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the day of the week and date windows.  The face of the watch is a deep blue/black.  In most lighting it appears black not blue.  The day of the week and date information is printed in what I would call a light grey.  Definitely not a bright white.  During the day it is OK to read, but in low light or at night, you can't make out the day of the week or the date.  In addition, the 2 arms of the watch are definitely wide.  When either of them is pointing at 3 you definitely cannot read the day of the week or the date information.<br /><br />Otherwise I am having a ball wearing this watch."
4.0,"Great amazing compression shorts. cheapest ones ive found anywhere, that are also really good quality. this is a good buy. cheap and great quality!"
4.0,"Están un poco pequeños, pero muy lindos!"
4.0,"So, overall do you have high expectations for a top that costs 8.50? Meh lol. Fit is abit on the snugger side so if you're between sizes, size up. Dislike these can't go into the dryer and are hang dry. I wash and delicate cycle and it's fine. So overall it's cute it works for what I wear them with. Would I write home and tell mama about them? I don't reckon so. But if you're happy with the price point and you need  something that will do here ya go."
4.0,Very comfortable. The pads are thick so they show through clothes but they're removable. Fits a little big but has adjustable straps. Would definitely recommend.
4.0,The dress fit nicely. The material was thinner than I expected.
4.0,Very comfortable dress I m 5-3 around 130 lb order small fits very well length is also very appropriate the only reason I gave 4 star I just don’t like the design it’s look so pretty in pic but flowers are very big just not my taste but overall very nice dress not even return it
4.0,"This is a very soft, true to size sweater. I wouldn't consider it oversized. My biggest issue is that I ordered purple, but received blue. My daughter liked the wrong color more than I did, so I passed it on to her. I would have returned it for the correct color, but it took a long time for this sweater to arrive. I really didn't want to wait and potentially get the wrong item again."
4.0,"A nice piece. I got two from the same seller (Yazilind). Super fast delivery. This items is very attractive and fits better than the other I ordered. the hanging pendant is antique looking, so the metal appears tarnished. I believe it is supposed to look this way. I don't care for this as much as untarnished personally, but it is very beautiful and I already got a compliment on this item."
4.0,supposed to be black but looks more like navy blue
4.0,"This necklace was very pretty and the centrepiece was very large, my problem with most necklaces is that you don't know if you going to be able to see from far away the jewelry there's no problem with that when you're wearing this. It looks stunning and I love it."
4.0,"I like this pendant however it is gold, not bronze in color. It is made well and will hold up to dsily wear."
4.0,This product is thin and stretchy. Fits as expected the only thing is I find it a tad short. Other than that it’s s cute design and looks nice.
4.0,Not the greatest quality but fits comfortably and my kid never complained about it. Very cute. Fits true to size.
4.0,"I loved these, and will order them again. They were sturdy, good quality. The best part is that the cabachons fit PERFECTLY! I didn't have to wiggle the cabachons around AT ALL; I just dropped them into the trays, and they were perfectly aligned. Considering how many times I've ordered sets of trays/cabachons that didn't fit together, these were a breath of fresh air!<br /><br />The only thing wrong was that one of the trays wasn't perfectly flat, so the cabachons wouldn't lay flat in the tray. But the rest were all great. :)"
4.0,"Nice material, very pretty pattern. a little bit too snug for my head."
4.0,my 2 year old daughter loves it and wears wherever we go .
4.0,These plugs are very comfortable. The material is thin but not too thin. I only wish that I had received a wider variety of colors.
4.0,"We didn't realize that these were that nylon, full of holes, material and so our daughter has to wear a pair of stretch pants underneath these when she wears them.  That said, she like them and wears them in gym almost every day."
4.0,"Those rain boots are bigger than expected. We bought it for our 4y old son, he is usually wearing size 13, but those are more like 14."
4.0,"These earrings are perfect for wearing with my denim clothing, which was why I.ordered them. Well made and look just like described. However, the fact that they would not ship to Hawaii from Florida, when it is same cost as to any other US location, was aggravating. I ended up having them sent to a friend, who then shipped them on to me."
4.0,Gave as a gift for son-in-law and he loved it...wouldn't take the hat off all Christmas Day!
4.0,Cute . Tricky to get on.
4.0,"I wasn't sure about this watch because of the price but since I own several cheap Chinese watches I gave it a shot. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by it's fit ,finish and accuracy. The back of the watch has an exhibition window with a nicely finished counterweight and it's a screw on case back! Wow is all I can say to that. The watch straps are real leather not the plastic pleather you usually get. The face of the watch is decorated with luminous numbers and hands that glow ok. The escapement action is visible at six o'clock position which adds interest to the watches face. It has the day, date and month also. The watch is a close copy of a Panerai luminor. So far the watch runs very accurately and if it continues to do so I will raise my rating. I definitely feel that I got more than my money's worth and you will to if you buy it."
4.0,"These pants are not what I thought they were. I thought they were sweatpants, but they are just cotton. They are light weight so probably best to wear them in warmer weather. They are true to size."
4.0,"The readers are very stylish in person. They have a designer look. The fit is very comfortable so I don’t mind keeping them on when I get up to walk around. The only thing is the lenses get smudgy easy without touching them. I find myself constantly wiping them off with the glass cloth included. Nice case too. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase."
4.0,Over all pretty good only one was a little damaged but still wearable
4.0,Was absolutely beautiful it killed me to have to send it back because it runs small you need to size up on this
4.0,Style and nice fabric
4.0,"I’ll start with the positive - I really like the fit and feel of this dress. The material doesn’t feel cheap, it’s stretch and comfortable and looks well made. The length is perfect for a more formal event or for work, and the style is very flattering. I am 5’ 5’’, 170lbs, 34DD and very curvy with a small waist - the Large fit perfectly. I think a medium may have worked as well but they unfortunately don’t carry it.<br />HOWEVER I bought the navy color thinking I could pair it with nude heels. DO NOT BE FOOLED - what shows as a nude color block in the photos is actually PINK. I sadly will be returning because it looks so stupid, but I really loved the dress itself. So badly wish the maroon was in stock in my size :("
4.0,Nice sunglasses. Great eyepieces that give good protection against glare. They are a little delicate since they are made of wood so don't just toss them around.
4.0,"For the price, this is really a good deal. You could wear the shirts to church or to work out in. I use them for my soccer league because I needed two shirts that I could iron and number on the back and then throw away after a couple seasons. Would give these 5 out of 5 Stars if they were a little more soft, but for the price they are the best deal I've found."
4.0,"Very comfy, fits as expected I wear 12/14 and it fit me great"
4.0,"pretty good, breaks easily the butterfly on the bottom popped off after a day of use"
4.0,This ring is beautiful and goes great!  I actually love it !  It did take an extra long time for shipping to the point I forgot I had ordered it.
4.0,"It's a pretty basic box link chain.  My girlfriend is pretty rough on jewelry and it hasn't broken yet, so it must be durable enough.  Nothing special to it, but if you are looking to hold a charm, this works fine."
4.0,Great purchase. No regrets.very nice quality
4.0,Comfortable. I really like this suit.
4.0,I love these bags.  They are light weight and roomy. My only disappointment was that the material was not smooth like my previous traveling bag.  It felt like velvet. I believe it is bulb. It is the newer model travel on in purple.
4.0,The posts irritate my sensitive ears a little but they are very pretty. I coat them in neosporin before inserting and that seems to help.
4.0,Very cute and made well enough for the price.<br />Bright vibrant colors. Love it !
4.0,"Nothing more to say, it is a nice choker."
4.0,Love it  after 5 years and still going
4.0,This is a pretty nice scarf for every day use. I like pairing up scarves with my outfits as they give them more dimension and make them look stylish. Light material scarves are great for any weather.<br /><br />I like the soft material and the comfortable feel of this scarf. Its color is nice and sober and looks really nice. The size is good enough to wrap around your neck and even wear on the head if it gets warm and sunny. Over all a nice buy.<br /><br />Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.
4.0,I look exactly like my grandma in these things and embarrass all of my friends. They work great at blocking the sun too! Acceptable quality at an acceptable price.
4.0,Nice shirt. Fits a little large though. I usually take a large but could have gotten a medium.
4.0,"Great shoes! They are perfect. I had to take out the insoles because they were crooked, but not big deal. I really like them."
4.0,Cute...  just order a couple sizes larger than you think you need...
4.0,It's great quality actually what you see in the pic . Which the good quality was a pleasant surprise. Flows very well looks better without petite coat than without.
4.0,"The quality of this tshirt is very good.  It's thicker than a regular tshirt without much stretch.  With this in mind, the sizing is on the smaller side.  I usually wear a medium in most clothes, for reference, I'm 5'8"", 135lbs, 34 C.  Luckily I ordered a large bc they did not have a medium.  I like the length too because it hits right at my hips so when I crouch down, it still keeps everything covered :) If you're looking for a more fitted shirt, this is would fit the bill."
4.0,"Sadly, I got the wrong size and it is too late to return now. :("
4.0,"Shirt was good quality.  True to size. Represented the player and organization well.  Gift for 8 yr. old grandson.  He thought it was ""AWWWESOME"" .  So that's what matters."
4.0,"I like this band better than the original that came with the watch.  The band is a softer rubber and is more flexible.  The pink color looks great and is not &#34;too&#34; pink.  the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is it took me  a while to get the bands to snap securely in place.  In the interim the watch kept flying off my arm.  Once I was able to lock everything in place, the watch and band stayed securely on my wrist."
4.0,Very light weight and sheer
4.0,The blouse fit but the pants are shorter for being pants and tight at the ankle and the shorts were too big and longer than expected for being shorts and the shorts are wider than the pants so if they were reversed on the size it would of been perfect
4.0,It was beautiful and our granddaughter loved it. The design was very attractive on her. There was a thread loose in where the neck joined the upper torso part but we were able to crochet it back in.
4.0,"A special watch, not only for my need, but also a great pleasure to give as a gift to the special people in my life. Thanks!"
4.0,"if the price is similar, I will buy again when I need new.  its been 8 or 9 months, and I expect to wear another year or more.  they did loosen up a lot after 2 months of wear."
4.0,"It fit well, but not perfectly.  No style, so just a T-shirt.  Not cheap for what it is."
4.0,Its cute. Just not on me.
4.0,I love this dress. It's very nice material and thick. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because it looks different than the photo. I am 5'7 165 lbs after having a baby and the large fits great.
4.0,"This is a bright pink color but I love it.  Not sure why, but some of the colors are higher priced and this one was reasonably priced!"
4.0,"The other set I ordered from the company had a missing gem from the earring, however this one was not damaged. It comes in a nice sturdy box and the set is very pretty. The quality is not the best but you obviously get what you pay for. If you are looking for something to wear once or twice thatll look great in pics etc - this would be great for you. If you are trying to invest in some real proper jewelry, you will not like this"
4.0,"Beautiful, but definitely does not fit M or L--more like XXS to S, or a very tight M.  Still, I can give them as a wonderful gift to one of my slim friends."
4.0,"Worked well for what I needed.  It provided coverage yet some sexiness with the lace overlay.  The fit was great, could have been a little larger.  One minor fault is that it snags easily, but that was most likely d/t my bangles I work."
4.0,Super cute but shoulder pads are huge. Had to return as my husband said it looked too much like lady gaga :)
4.0,"One of the reasons I got this is because of the handle, I don't like to carry a purse all the time, however the clasp broke after a few weeks."
4.0,Loved them! But too expensive for stickers.
4.0,Nice everyday casual dress.
4.0,"Material is nice, thought it would be a little thicker. The dress isn’t see through so that was a plus as well. I got a small. Fits great!!"
4.0,I Absorootree Rove these polo S***S! #1 Polo S***! Neva have Polo S*** feer Sooo gooud!
4.0,"Considering I’m 5’9 & generally an XL these pants fit really well . I can tell they’ll also fit well on someone who’s an actual large in size, the length and stretch are great . The band folds when I bend down etc. also I’ve yet to workout in them so I can’t give 5stars at this time. But I overall give them a thumbs up"
4.0,Trying to figure out how this fits is like performing rocket surgery.
4.0,"I purchased two pair.  One for my Mom, who has arthritis in her hands and always is complaining her hands are so cold.  The second pair was for myself.  I get calluses on my hands from my walker.  I too have some arthritis.  They will fit almost any hand.  Mine are medium and my Mom's are larger.  I think we will both get a lot of use out of the gloves.  They appear to be made pretty well."
4.0,They aren’t very thick but higher waisted.  It helps hold a little chub in.
4.0,I will never spend a million dollars for one pair of these at the beauty supply store again.  I normally pay $2.99 for one pair.  These are great and I would give 5 stars accept they don't all seem to be the same size.  I use it as a nose ring and don't have to switch out for about two months.
4.0,Great quality and gift for my son.  Only drawback was that I wanted to have the front and back engraved.  There was the name &#34;crucible&#34; on the back that I had to have removed before I could engrave the back.
4.0,I am lucky enough to have two step-daughters and wanted to get them a little something on my own.  They really liked them.
4.0,Very adorable little trinket
4.0,Way too big and I like my shirt loose.
4.0,"Bought this backpack for fun. I was looking for a sturdy backpack that would be large enough to carry clothes and other items without being too bulky. This seemed to fit the bill and looked great.<br /><br />I was very surprised when it came to me. The canvas is very thick and heavy. Compact looking but actually holds more than you think. About ten pockets in and out provides me additional storage. The straps are thick enough to hold that much weight and wide enough to make it comfortable to wear without being cumbersome.<br /><br />This is a great pack for everything from homework to hiking. this color choice was particularly nice looking. We're very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Pros :<br /><br />- Large enough to fit a large quantity of items, even the clothes for my 3 days' travelling.<br />- Multiple inside and outside pockets helps to store my little stuffs firmly without being trouble to think how to put those into the bag, save my time.<br />- The inside ipad pocket is big and sturdy.<br />- The laptop pocket works well for storing loose papers too.<br />- The drawstring stays tight for me.<br />- Great for casual everyday use, schooling, travelling, and shopping."
4.0,Ran small but super cute.
4.0,"Nice fit , worth of money"
4.0,I sent back my original size that I was a got a size bigger for a little<br />extra room.  Once I received the new size I absolutely love this jacked<br />plus it comes in so many colors.
4.0,Super cute! Run a little large. Bought them for my 2 year old that wears a toddler 6 shoe. My 4 year old wears a 10-11 and can wear them too!
4.0,"Love the shirt. The color (pink) matches pretty close to the picture and the print is vivid as shown. The top is not as long as it shows. If you have large arms, it will fit snug."
4.0,I love this color and the twist at the side adds fun to the shirt.  Looks and feels like a sweater but it is not sweater material.  Overall happy with this top will probably become one of my favorites in the fall.
4.0,"I ordered a men's large to compensate for the size difference. I received what seems to be a women's large, at any rate the zipper is on the side normally for women. The jacket fits okay in the body although the shoulder's are not as large as I would like or expect in a man's jacket. The ad states lightweight, and this jacket is very lightweight, in polite terms."
4.0,"Good quality for the cost. It’s very sturdy, however the gold is starting to fade."
4.0,"Mom loved it stopped telling time, but started back"
4.0,Second time I bought this for my guy. Very comfortable.
4.0,"I purchased the Ruler cosplay Women's Sexy Pantyhose Thigh High Stockings Garter Belt as a gift for my girlfriend and after adding a few other select accessories to the gift package, she, …. well, perhaps I should say we enjoyed the gift, that is, I enjoyed seeing it on her and she enjoyed prancing around the house (oh my!) in her gift.  What more can I say, the quality appeared to be well-made and durable, but according to the GF, the size did run just a teeny bit smaller than what she was used to even for her at 5’ 1”, 120-something lbs., but overall she was very happy with the Ruler cosplay Women's Sexy Pantyhose Thigh High Stockings Garter Belt and yep, so was I!  I received this product at a discount for a fair and honest review and the GF said she plans to purchase more at a later time."
4.0,"I wanted a pretty blouse for work and this works perfectly. It's light so not hot but also covers enough that I don't get cold in an office setting. I am 5'7"" and 150lbs with a medium build and the medium size fits perfect. loose enough to be appropriate but fitted enough to be cute. The bottom is rounded in the front and back where it falls just about to the top of my thighs. The sides hit right at my hips. Overall would recommend for office setting. Have worn it about 10 times now and regular wash cycle and have had no issues"
4.0,Smaller than expected but very nice for newborn. Perfect keepsake for that special baby girl!
4.0,I love all of the colors that these headbands came in.  My daughter is three months old and 10lbs and these are big on her.  I used tape to make the headband piece smaller.  She will grow into them.
4.0,They are really cute but they are for a baby or a little girl they aren’t for women
4.0,Manaixuan summer tunic dress. This tunic dress is cute and I like the bold bright colors. It is see through so you will need a slip. I like the sleeves they are layered and 3/4 length. The dress fits well and ties at the neck in front on the neck chest area and lands above my knee. I am 5'4 111lbs and a 34D and this size medium fit well. Cute tunic dress for work or a casual evening out. The material is thin as I mentioned and it does wrinkle. I fluff dried this dress and the wrinkle mostly disappeared. Cute navy blue floral print summer dress.
4.0,Great product.  I was a bit skeptical about the design.  Turns out it isn't a distraction.
4.0,"Nice sturdy and long posts-which seem to be rare in earrings of this price. Earrings have a nice sparkle to them. My only complaint, and just cos it's my preference, is that the earrings are set too high."
4.0,Nice dress.  Fabric is a little thin.
4.0,"Sleeves are super skinny, but I really like how it drapes in front. I can live with the tight sleeves because the material is stretchy enough."
4.0,"very versatile, good quality"
4.0,"Good quality ring, love the detail. This is the first style ring i've ever purchased that fit without getting stuck. I have never worn a ring, aside from an engagement ring. The sizing is a little off, as it sort of fits on many of my fingers, which makes it difficult to decide where to wear it. But so far, its great on my middle right. A store associate sized my fingers at 14, 13, and 10. For index , thumb and pinky. I ordered a 15, and it fits snugly on 4 out of 5 fingers."
4.0,I love the way the sweater fits.  The only disappointment is the color.  I ordered the red but to me it appears to be more of a burnt orange.  If I had seen it in a store I would not have purchased it because of the color but it fits great so I will keep.
4.0,Very warm and has a really nice inner lining. I live in WI so this is a must! I really like hat and color (purple) however this was a bit larger than i expected. It makes my head look just a tad bulky haha! It looks better with my hair down vs in a pony. I wear this daily though!
4.0,"The material is very thin ,but this is what I am looking for"
4.0,"I wear size 34 pants and ordered 34-36&#34; belt. Ran on the shorter size so I recommend getting one 2-3&#34; larger. But it came with a leather hole punch, so it was easy to simply add an extra hole. Overall, the quality appears durable and I'm incredibly happy with the style of it."
4.0,"A birthday gift. No co,plaints."
4.0,"Great dress, great price! The cut out in the front was a bit more open than expected, so I had to sew it up a few inches to make the dress wearable. Other than that, it's beautiful and fit great."
4.0,Its adorable!
4.0,Pretty gift for best friend
4.0,"This dress is super cute and runs true to size. I am 5'9&#34; with a 36DD bust, and I typically wear a size 6/8. This is polyester, so some may get a little warm in it, but being winter, I was perfectly comfortable. It is just this side of a bit short, and I wore it with leggings just to be safe. Come warmer weather I would be okay with wearing it alone."
4.0,"Ok charms, price is decent. Compare to other websites."
4.0,"My husband LOVES his shirt!  I'm the one who does the laundry though, and I noticed that the print seems to be wearing very quickly.  It's like a vintage-looking shirt now.  He hasn't noticed anything though"
4.0,"The dress was beautiful and fit nicely.  I ended up choosing a different dress,  so retuned this one.  It  took 6 different attempts then had to contact customer services 3 times, finally got it return.  Then 4 months later still no refund so I had to dispute it with my credit card.....  ugh.....  not happy....."
4.0,"This is more of a shirt than a dress.  That you can wear with tights,jeans or shorts<br />Very nice material, vivid colors, recommended machine wash and hang dry.<br />Overall very nice and pleased with my purchased with a great price"
4.0,Pictured exactly as it is.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Better quality than expected for price.
4.0,It’s cheap but enough for all I need. Quality is good and price is good.
4.0,"These boots are great. We have purchased Old West boots before and have nothing but good luck with them, so decided to go with these and they provide the same great quality as the ones we had before. My son loves the orange color, and wears them everyday. The only thing I wish I knew before ordering them was that the the brown on the boot is not just a plain dark brown like the picture shows, but more spotted looking. I was not a big fan of it at first, but my son did not mind. Overall, great boot and perfect for little cowboys."
4.0,The piercings are really pretty i love them its just that the bar of the piercing is shorter than my first orgainal piercing
4.0,Top fit perfectly but the bottoms were too small. Luckily it's black and you can find anything to match. Really cute suit.
4.0,Beautiful skirt and color. I’m 5’10 and it was for length for me. Still obsessed with it and plan to buy in other colora
4.0,"Really pretty, exactly as shown in picture. I really do like this bra but my only complaint is that it's not tight enough around the body. The straps are good and snug, just a little lose around the bottom. It could just be me though. Overall it's a good product."
4.0,"Bought these at my mom's request.<br /><br />I'm not sure how exactly the old ones are supposed to come out of the heels, but she said the metal part will not stay inside what is worn out. She makes do with what she has on hand though. Thank you!"
4.0,"I applied them to a metal coffee travel mug.<br /><br />They arrive between two sheets of plastic, you peel the back off, place the decal where you want it (aided by holding the front sheet of plastic), rub the decal in place through the top sheet, remove top sheet.<br /><br />They look great, and are durable so far, but the decal front is  sticky from the top sheet."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for someone. She really liked it, although is a bit large on her."
4.0,"Wear it daily and wash it often, holds up great"
4.0,Products is good but does not work with glasses.( they fog up ).
4.0,"what can you say about a mask?  for SecondSkin, a lot!  It's quite comfortable, very affordable, durable, and breathable.  I use my mask as a costume gimmick when I DJ and one can see and maneuver without any problems even in a dimly lit night club!  an excellent buy!"
4.0,"Visually appealing, size runs a bit small. Else ok for price paid."
4.0,This is a surprisingly cute dress and can be used as a sort of trench coat.
4.0,Cozy & comfy
4.0,loose fit but still too big .nice quality
4.0,"Super cute. I get lots of compliments. Glad I read reviews and ordered a size up. I'm usually a medium and a large fits perfect. However, it's really thin, and I'm not sure how many washings  it will last."
4.0,Haven't used yet but looking forward to rocking.
4.0,I wore these amazing pants yesterday during my workout. Afterwards I wore them while painting. When I bent down to paint I heard a RIP and they ripped right in my crotch area. My fiancé’s entire family saw as we have been letting them stay with us during the Coronavirus outbreak. His mother is sick and now I feel like I’m unsure of how to return this to replace it. I don’t think I should leave the house if I’m a carrier but I truly believe everything in our has has been compromised as his parents are older and have rough immune systems.
4.0,Muy lindo. Y comodo
4.0,This product was delivered on time and was really worth the price they charged. The earrings are beautiful and very light. They shine like stainless steel and this is the only reason why I did not give a 5. As I was expecting a little less shine and more of a matte silver look . But over all this product is really good. The fringes are very delicate and thin. They are soldered to the top so that they don't come out easily or break.<br /><br />They don't have any kind of lock at the back . But the hook is deep enough to keep the earrings from falling out.
4.0,"Order 7/12/16 received 7/20/16 expected date was 8/4/16-81/12/16<br />Please with the early shipment, I bought this item for myself im about 7mos prego thinking this would make a good walk around the house/nightwear. I order the XXL im about 215lbs 5.3 belly size sorta big, This is not going to work for me i might can wear 1 time but after a wash its not going to work. But i have a daughter 145lbs she could use it. The price was low so no need to return it can make a good gift. the quality of this item feels average as any cotton tee shirt, its slightly see thru not real noticable and it do feel like it will be comfy to wear inside worn as a bathing suit cover/ sleepwear/ housewear/ yard wear/"
4.0,Decent dress. I suggest using a strapless bra underneath.
4.0,"Even though this mask is what I want it but it’s not get my face as it should. It have lots of space at the chin area, I guess for large face?"
4.0,Works great under my hat. Just wish it was a little wider.
4.0,Got for Christmas gifts.
4.0,Funcionó perfecto para mi disfraz sin embargo los guantes son bastante grandes en la partes que va en el antebrazo.
4.0,I am 5'5 175. curvy. and was not able to raise past my thighs. no stretch material.
4.0,It is smaller than expected. My son is 5 and it was too tight around his head. It is more of a toddler than a kids hat
4.0,"Inexpensive, slim fit, nice & light for Florida summers... but I can't wear it to work because of that number on the sleeve. I guess I didn't notice it in the photo when I placed the order."
4.0,Love the color and fabric. A bit smug and high waisted
4.0,"Sleeves run small, very tight, I've ordered this dress before same size, different colors, and this was shipped different, (cheap clear bag) and the sleeves ran very tight"
4.0,Velcro to close sleeves works good for those with short arms
4.0,"I play a lot of softball and prefer to use over-the-calf socks during my games in comparison to wearing long baseball pants, so I was very excited to give this pair of socks a try and compare it to the other brands I've used like Under Armour and Adidas. I wear a size 13 shoe, so I found myself to be on the very cusp of having the Large/X-Large size fit me. Luckily my feet aren't very wide or I think I may have had issues. As other reviewers have commented, the compression aspect of these socks does in fact make them feel tighter than a standard pair of socks. If you have ankle issues, these will be helpful in keeping your ankle in place during running and exercising. Also, the padded cushion on the bottom of the sock is a nice touch that really does make these feel very comfortable.<br /><br />My biggest problem with these socks is the price. Name brands like Under Armour and Adidias charge much less for their over the calf socks, and while these might be more comfortable, I'm not sure that difference accounts for these costing more than double than well known brands. For that reason, I have to dock this item one star. If the price adjusts down to a more competitive level, I will be more than happy to update my rating."
4.0,"For a size large, the dress seems small. I usually wear a medium. It washes well and retains it's shape."
4.0,People said to buy bigger for a looser fit so I bought a large cut I wear a medium. it's very flowy. love it. if you want a slighter slim fit medium would have worked also.it was a bit see through but my black brah did the trick.
4.0,"like it , however it was too tight across the chest...had to return"
4.0,Good quality but wish they were shorter or a size for more petite women.
4.0,This backpack could stand to be a little larger.  A second full sized zipper compartment would go a long way.  So far though we love it.  It has little plastic burgers (the feel like erasers but aren't) on the zippers.  Bought it for my 4th grade son.  Works for him because he doesn't have a ton of items to carry for school.  It definitely wouldn't work for my 7th grader who has huge binders and many books to carry.  It wouldn't fit for her.
4.0,"This ring gets dirty looking quickly (IMO), but I absolutely love it. It is beautiful!!"
4.0,Soo stinking cute but they won’t stay on my granddaughter’s feet because there’s no back
4.0,We love the color.<br />The size is a bit smaller. My girl is 6y/o and she wear a 6. Got her a size bigger for better fitting.
4.0,ok not bad for price
4.0,"You get what you pay for.  The colors are nice, and there's good variety.  The fabric is fine, but the stitching is loose.  I'm guessing I'll have to restitch most of the edges after a few uses.  Still, you can't beat the price.  I'd consider ordering from this company again."
4.0,Really nice watch doesn't show that the gold is rose hold but still a nice watch
4.0,"Great price for these. I actually used them for a Christmas tree project. We popped out the lenses and glued photos to them using spray adhesive, spray painted the frames metallic, glittered blue, popped the lenses back in and tied them to the tree. Worked out great."
4.0,I liked these. I think the price was good and they came pretty quickly. I would order again. All three pieces are exactly the same.
4.0,Love it...purchased as gifts!
4.0,Looked okay. I ended up returning it because it was way too big for my daughter's wrist.
4.0,"Cute, NOT see through, comfy and got a lot of complimets"
4.0,It gives a casual look to drab outfit.
4.0,This was a gift and she expressed that she really liked it.  I was very happy with the purchase.
4.0,"If your expecting a thick warm hoodie, it's not.  I bought it for my daughter for Xmas of 2020  (it's now April 2021) and she won't stop wearing it.  Even after a few machine washes the hoodie stills looks brand new and it hasn't shrunk.  I bought my older son a Naruto one as well and will buy more."
4.0,Shirt fits snug & I sized up.
4.0,Love it. Flattering. So comfy.
4.0,Good quality and good stretch.  Very pretty.
4.0,These are really cute on. The only issue is that they are kinda big on my head so they fit a bit loose. Otherwise I really like them
4.0,Gift for my daughter..I never saw it. The picture loomed nice though
4.0,"This is by far the best one on the internet out of all the jounin vests that i have seen. at first i was a little confused on what size to order cause it showed full body messurements and some of the inches didn't match like waist and chest by an inch or so but it fits like a glove. only issues with it are that i wish the length was longer by an inch or so, and that there was more stuffing in the vest so it was like the actual one instead of like a thick shirt. still super pleased with it so i gave it 4/5 starts very much worth the purchase."
4.0,Order this bag for Disney world n I loved it!
4.0,A little see-through.  A cami recommended.  Sleeves were overly long for me.  But immediately received compliments from others.
4.0,Looks nice.  It's a Xmas gift for my daughter who loves Rhinos.  So hard to find Rhinos
4.0,"I've ridden in these capris twice, 25 and 35 miles respectively. They are comfortable, the skirt looks cute for walking though it has a tendency to hike up and get caught in hem of my jersey. The shorts have padding that fits my anatomy and a long rise that comes up to my waist and doesn't slide down and doesn't dig in. I'm tall in the hips, not big in the butt, no saddle bags. Legs fit well, I have muscular quads and calves like many cyclists. Fabric seems a bit thin so don't know how long they will last. I had a coupon for $15 off, so at half price they were a good buy.  They grey ""patches"" that appear in the illustration are mesh inserts. Don't need the mesh, I'd rather they were not there as may shorten the life of the capris. If you are between sizes or at the larger end of the range, order the larger size.  This is not a fabric or style that you want to wear too small or stretched too thin. My pair fits well and skirt hangs in it's A-line shape properly.  If it pulls and catches your tummy or butt too tightly, you bought them in too small a size."
4.0,Nice variety but some of the charms are pretty big.
4.0,For the price they are amazing. I love the firm fit and the stylish look!
4.0,"I ordered a large, I should’ve ordered a medium for size reference I’m a 10/12 jeans large top and this set fit me a little big you can get away with sizing down"
4.0,"They fit good, seem warm. Can't wait to have cooler weather to wear them!"
4.0,"At first opening  of the product out of the package, it looked so small but it does stretch really well. I was so surprised at how much it can stretch. It is a bit thin but you can’t really see through. It feels so soft and smooth. The length is pretty good given, that I am a short person. I won’t really use this pants when I work out. I would use it with some shirt that covers my butt , almost like a tunic. I just feel it being on the thinner side for my liking. But it is a good legging under a dress or a longer shirt. Its good to have but I would not say your go to leggings."
4.0,I love the llok of these panties but if you order thenou may want to order a bit bigger than usual. I am a medium  but ordered a large after reading the other reviews and they fit perfect.  You get a great product for the price. However Idid get 2 colors of many pair rather than 12 different colors. It was great to have 2 black & 2 white but I would rather have a mix up of others. That is just preference for me.
4.0,"Super cute but can only wear knotted on the side or in front because there is a weird seam on the side that has a gigantic point (which is where I knotted it) but the material is super lightweight and comfy and doesn't feel cheap! I really like it, but again it pretty much has to have a knot in it because of the weird seamlines."
4.0,"I’d give it 5 stars if it didn’t cut off sound quite so much.  The spring band is quite strong, which is great because I use that to attach it to the stamp of the bag I carry.  Cheap and cheerful."
4.0,i bought this hat for driving. The large brim hats i have aren't safe while driving. I also wear it on the beach and it does a good job protecting me from the sun. Also polyester is apparently does better job protecting from the sun than cotton or linen. This one is a keeper.
4.0,The dress color was true to the picture. Lace around the arms are pure white. The dress material is not heavy.
4.0,"I got the 20mm, black band. Although I really don't like suede watch bands, I got this for a dress watch and, to be fair, it looks good and wears well.<br /><br />This Newborn strap is made of good materials with the alternately smooth and rough suede, depending on which way you rub it, and smooth, soft leather backing. The buckle and pin are stainless and sufficient with the triangle logo of Newborn etched on it. Easy as can be, the quick-change pins go right in without a hitch.<br /><br />This is a good band for a dress watch is you're looking for suede or just something a little different than most leather bands. Wears well too."
4.0,"Durable clean design. Lots of pockets. A bit on the small side, but is very well made."
4.0,The color hasn't changed on me from wearing it
4.0,they  r  probably just fine.  but being of large hands i mayhaps should have gone for an 8 inch.  3 pc set a great value
4.0,"I'm 6ft tall and 145lbs, and a medium slim fit top is usually a good fit. As can be seen from the unflattering selfie this cardigan is the right length, but considerably baggier around the middle than expected.<br />The material is a surprisingly heavy cotton blend. It's soft, but not fluffy and can be worn comfortably against bare arms or layered over shirts. The finish is good, although I spotted some light pilling, and a few badly finished and plucked threads on the first wearing.<br />It's not a heavy cardigan, and the blend won't be as warm as a wool knit on a snowy winter's night, but for the Florida winter I'm experiencing it is perfect for keeping the cooler breezes at bay after the sun sets. Perfect for lounging around the house, but the slightly baggy fit means it's a bit too casual for me to consider wearing it out and about."
4.0,If you don’t want it to fit snug go up a size. Good material just didn’t like it being form fitting.
4.0,These are just barely woolen but they fit nicely and are warm.  The colors are true to the socks pictured.
4.0,Being 5'1 I'll need to have it hemmed by about a foot but over all it's beautiful and I can't wait to wear it
4.0,Fits me well. Small size.
4.0,"Good size, good quality and good price.  I'm going wear it on my next trip to Toronto and already very excited."
4.0,"Had some trouble receiving. Took a very long time to get here! Had to email and complain but then once they were sent I didn't have anymore problems! Strong, durable, and cute!"
4.0,Runs small ordera size up
4.0,nice wallet for my husband he likes the size it’s not bulky. Great price
4.0,The charm is beautiful. The necklace tarnished in weeks of daily wear.
4.0,"Order AT LEAST 2 sizes bigger ... lol.. my husband wanted me to keep it... but good gosh, I've got a ways to go to be that confident in an itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini.  Lol.  Very cute; if it actually fit, I would totally have kept it."
4.0,"It was a little shorter than I wanted. Luckily, it fit my daughter, so we kept it. Otherwise, it's super cute"
4.0,"I bought this for my best friend and she absolutely loved it! The only thing wrong with it is the chain, but she's gotten tons of compliments on the airplane itself!"
4.0,"Pretty cute, wasn’t exactly as pictured but whatever- I chose tie dye, they won’t all look the same. I’m 4’11 with short torso and big chested so large actually fit nicely and just shows a peak of my midriff. This is for sure a crop top, so if you raise your hand any higher than your shoulder- expect to wear a crop top inside or cute sports bra because it will show. It feels comfortable but it is very thin, pretty much a long sleeve shirt with hood that was cut."
4.0,"Not a bad piece, matches quality/size of the other stones.  A bit pricy but worth it if you're looking to get the whole set.  The red stripe in the middle illuminates with the flick of a switch on the bottom (batteries not included) and has a slow pulse.  Overall happy with this product, would recommend to anyone thinking about getting one."
4.0,"Earrings were as expected, glad to be able to get them in clip-on style. Price was good. Would re-order if needed."
4.0,The material was a little different then expected and it was smaller then i thought. Get one size bigger if your going for a baggy look
4.0,Love the color and fabric is soft
4.0,"Cute, but some stretching out in the first few wears. You get what you pay for I guess."
4.0,The quality of the material of the dress was nice and did not feel like a 15$ dress although I had to return bc it kept raising to the point of showing my butt. I ordered a medium size and I’m usually a size small to medium. 34C bra cup and size 4 or 6 petite in pants. This dress would have been ideal for me if it wasn’t bc of the shortness issue.
4.0,"The dress was good, fits well, it was only the zipper the it was defective."
4.0,These do what they are designed to do.
4.0,These are great gym shower shoes.  Or just running to the mailbox.  Not the greatest comfort.  But it's a flip flop
4.0,"The fit is as expected through the body. I do plan to have this dress cut to, a couple inches above my ankles. I’m 5’2” and it will be more flattering, at that length on me. I will use fashion tape to secure a smooth, non- gaping look at the deep neckline.<br />I bought the gray. This is a dress for all seasons.<br />Beautiful for a summer wedding or Winter Holiday party."
4.0,have only worn once but seemed loose in some areas and tight in others- nothing uncomfortable.  Hoping a few washes breaks them in.
4.0,"Perfect, size is to fit"
4.0,"hopeful the lace will soften after a few washes, but otherwise lightweight and very comfortable."
4.0,The swaddle is well made. Fabric is soft and breathable. I love the two-way zipper. It makes changing diaper easily. The material is thin and  I don't find any tog rating. It only for warm weather.
4.0,"This item was smaller than I thought. The fabric is sturdy and a great color. However, you CANNOT bend over without your underwear showing through. I am plus size so that might be an issue."
4.0,It's pretty but not very durable. The wires holding the stone are very thin. Mine broke the first time I attempted to try it on. However this seller took care of the issue and refunded me very very quickly (why I gave it a 4)
4.0,ordered a couple months ago. i don't like to write reviews until im able to wear them and see how they hold up. i wear them daily and have had zero issues. they don't hurt my ears and i have sensitive ears. ive got them wet a couple times in the pool and no rust issues.
4.0,"My wife ordered these for Halloween. For the price, the quality was fine. The fit was also fine. But she has a small, Asian-sized head, so maybe these won't work for everyone. I would give the product five stars, but it took the seller 3 days to process the order. Most online orders that I place are shipped the next day. Maybe I'm spoiled."
4.0,"Love the floral print. Fit is a bit snug, but wearable. I bought a large. I’m 5’6” and 148 lbs. I think an extra large would fit better across the bust."
4.0,I loved my body suit but it was a little small.  I will work on fitting into it though.  One thing I did not like was the stitching holding the zip in place had come undone so I had to get it repaired.  Besides that I love it.
4.0,"Happy with this purchase, although the material is a bit thinner than I expected.  Decent quality, good fit!"
4.0,Very cute! GREAT price!
4.0,I'm a size 7.5-8 US and these sock-slippers are a little large.  But I still love them.
4.0,Absolutely love these would just size up :)
4.0,Cons: The wire is difficult to open and close if you have hand arthritis.<br />The flap over the address is thin and easily falls open possibly allowing someone standing nearby to access your name and address.<br />Pros: good selection of colors.<br />The leather and wire appear durable.
4.0,Great for the price. Very feminine though. We bought these in both blue and pink for a boys' sports team for a fun summer event and they look pretty womanly - even the blue ones.
4.0,The front is a little weird. It just cuts off at the waist.
4.0,About a minute slow in 24 hours but nice watch matches my band
4.0,"Really liked it, but for s few dollars more adjustable straps would of been nicer"
4.0,These were just to Large for Me but are Great quality and Extra Light weight.  I would recommend
4.0,It fit just right....I wear a medium!!!
4.0,"I like it, it's cute and practical...I had a bit of trouble pulling my license out of the wallet because there isn't a finger push hole in the picture window, so I ended up having to punch a few holes in it to access my license- which was pointless because it still doesn't slide out very easily. HOWEVER, because the wallet is flexible and the leather is soft, it's not as hard to pull it out as I thought it would be...so now I just have an impractical weird hole in the plastic window. Other than that the wallet is great, I like the material and it's very flexible with lots of pockets and pouches to put things in. So, I recommend it, just hide the hole punch."
4.0,Nice piece but heavier than I imagined
4.0,I know the dimensions of the pin were given but in all honestly is is pretty small.  A larger size would be perfect! Quality is good and so is the design.  Just needs to be a little larger.
4.0,I love these glasses I got so many compliments on them
4.0,"I absolutely love these shoes. Unfortunately, I had to return them because my daughter has narrow feet. They appear to be made really well though."
4.0,I LOVE THEM BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE TIGHT!<br /><br />I usually wear a 5 1/5 - ordered bigger because this is my second try to get the right size.  Still a bit small but I can wear them for office hours ok.
4.0,My little diva had so much fun wearing these gloves.  So fun.
4.0,"I have had my eye on this dress for a while and had a special evening event to attend so ordered it. I am very glad I read the reviews on fit and sizing. I usually wear a 16/18 in this type of dress and would typically order a 2X (I have an ample bust -- 40 G). I ordered this in a 3X Plus and it fits very snuggly but not too small (it's more of a bodycon fit for me than a fit and flare). I am going to wear some extrafirm shapewear with it to make it look just right. The fabric is the silky kind that doesn't wrinkle. It's thinner than I prefer in this kind of fabric but it's not sheer or see-through. Just lightweight. I am 5'9&quot; and for a maxi dress it's about an inch shorter than I prefer but it's definitely long. It hits just above my ankles. I would prefer it go to my heel. So, I am just going to wear it with flat sandals or low heels rather than a 1.5-2&quot; heel.<br /><br />Personally I think $50 is a bit overpriced for the dress. $35-40 would be more appropriate for the quality of this dress' fabric and construction. But I love the print and that's why I got it. I do like that the belt loops are made of the same fabric and not just braided thread. It helps the belt lie smoothly at the waistline."
4.0,A little bigger than expected. Decent quality. Worth the price.
4.0,Size up especially if you have had children recently or have any type of tummy pooch. Top is super cute
4.0,"Wanted to keep it, but ultimately ended up returning.  after wearing once it had stretched and began to get spaces between the pearls I was afraid it could break"
4.0,The shirts are a little too thin/sheer for my tastes but they do provide good coverage from the sun and they seem to wick away moisture fairly well.
4.0,Geart!!
4.0,Fit awesomely! Love them!
4.0,Cute. Great price.Four stars bc it took wayyy to long to get here:)
4.0,Just that the eye holes are off from where needed<br />But no issues
4.0,These faux leather leggings are fun and great for the price.  They don't seem to breathe so that might be an issue for some and especially is one is being very active.
4.0,"Exchange for a small, medium was too big."
4.0,I wear this to work my job is somewhat active. It has good support and shape. There are parts of it that are a bit uncomfortable but not to bad. It adjusts nicely. I would say this is small on the cup sizes I am roughly a large B or a small C and this thing is maxed out and I got the C cup. Good deal for the price.
4.0,"The fabric feels good.  The elastic is a little twisted, nothing I  could not fix.  Looks good on!  I am pleased.  It meets my expectations in quality as well. I gave it a 4 rating because I am small chested.  If i was bigger chested it would fill out better."
4.0,Looks good on my dog gets a lot oc compliments. Only thing the rings are a different color than the links
4.0,"I ordered a size up after reading the reviews great advice. I will however say the material looks a lot different in person, and these shirts are very casual. I prolly wouldn't of bought so many if I know they were so informal, but theyll get used."
4.0,"Nice soft leather. Holds multiple cards per pocket which I love. 2 things I don't love - no built-in divider for the checks, so I can write on them without the carbon ruining several checks down. It comes with a piece of cardboard that I can use for that, but I'm sure I'll lose it soon. The other thing is that I got the dark green. The pictures here show it as a bluish green, but it's not. It's just green. I'm a little disappointed but it's otherwise very nice so I'm pleased enough."
4.0,This dress is adorable on! A little tight in the chest area but the material is stretchy. Length is a little above the knee and I'm 5'8.
4.0,"I am so glad I found Patti Boutik clothing!  For 14 years, I bought all of my clothes from Victoria's Secret.  Since their clothing line was discontinued 4 years ago, I have been unable to find clothes with the style and fit that I had come to rely on with VS.  I stumbled upon Patti Boutik on Amazon and liked almost everything I saw!  I ordered several items, but was worried that the fabric quality may be subpar.  But I need not have worried!  I like this dress.  It is a bit plain (not fancy), but can be jazzed up with the right accessories.  I'm 5'9"" 125 lbs and a size Small is a perfect fit.  I just wish it had been available in more colors for some variety.  However, I will definitely be buying more Patti Boutik items."
4.0,"As someone else mentioned, the smell was very strong when I first opened the package. The smell quickly dissipated. I wear about a 5.5 to 6 US shoe, and I ordered a 37. I like this kind of shoe because my feet are so small that sometimes I have a hard time finding shoes and the Chinese shoes run smaller for me. I have to use the second slot for the strap across the ankle, but they otherwise fit well and are very comfortable. I plan to buy more, as they are very pretty - my husband immediately commented on them when I tried them on.They are as advertised. Other than the initial smell, I am happy with this purchase."
4.0,"This is a cute outfit, the price was reasonable. The fit is just right and it arrived on time. Not much more to say about it.  Would buy again :)"
4.0,"Still using this. Love how study it is, and no need to punch in new holes like a traditional belt."
4.0,I ordered this for my 9 year old niece but water still got in the cap and soaked her hair. I would recommend sizing it first before you buy. Very pleased otherwise though!
4.0,"I really like the durability of this item, fits true to size. It’s a great product."
4.0,I need a white tux coat . This one fit well at a reasonable price.
4.0,"This past weekend, while sitting still deer hunting for about six hours straight from about 6 am to noon, I could feel a 15-20 mile and hour wind in 30 degree temperatures on my arms but not on my chest and back. The wind chill was probably cooler than 30 degrees. It wasn't bad enough that I felt like needing to go get warmed up, but it was noticeably cooler than the rest of my body. It might have become an issue if it were about 5 or 10 degrees cooler outside. I was wearing two pair of long underwear tops and a long sleeve t-shirt under the coat. It might have made a difference if the long sleeve shirt was thicker. I really like all of the pockets and especially the magnets. I don't know if it is waterproof."
4.0,"This is a very nice dress. I like it because it is a shorter dress, but not a mini dress, giving me a little more room. I am thicker in my thigh and rear area and my dresses need to have a little stretch, while not lifting so much to be immodest. I like this dress because it is fitted, and appealing while being covered. The material feels silky, since it is a blend. It does recommend hand washing. I did run it rough the washer. Mine stayed safe with no snags or shrinkage, but do this at your own risk. I received this product at a reduced price or for Free in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,"It fits perfectly, I loved the color, loved everything about it."
4.0,These pants are very soft inside. Not as much cushion as the ones I bought for my 5 year old daughter but still soft I feel after a few washes the cushion may get thinner. I received them today. I am 5'1 110lbs wear a size 1 in pants if I'm lucky but fit in a 3. These are a perfect fit. These are gonna be my  lounging around tights I came back to start a return for a larger size but they give no option to size up or down I guess one size is suppose to fit all. I am going to keep them I hope they don't shrink.
4.0,Feminine and Softer looking than it appears on site. Gave as a gift.
4.0,"My son took to these very quickly! He’s never worn any before but asks for them in the pool, at the beach and in the tub! They have a great deal, are apparently comfortable with uses over 30mins but they do fog a bit. I’ve noticed that last part but my son doesn’t complain about it, he just keeps diving underwater! A great purchase!"
4.0,I had to have it altered because a little loose on the top & hem was too long .
4.0,It's protecting me
4.0,Nice cases but had to wait close to a month to get them!
4.0,Really cute. Only drawback is they chip easily
4.0,Beautiful color. Material could be a little more nicely made but it is pretty.
4.0,"Waist trainers are the biggest “diet and fitness” craze lately.  I wished these were really the end all, be all of being fat.  Unfortunately, they aren't.  They do show results but these are temporary.  I like to wear waist trainers because of the quick results and I own a handful.  This Colombian Latex Short Torso Sports Workout Waist Trainer Cincher with 3 Hook Rows looked like it would show more results than the other ones I owned.  Upon receiving  this waist trainer, there a strong rubber smell  coming from this.  I had to unhook the clasps and let this waist trainer off gas and air off for 2 days outside.  The smell was still there after the 2 days but it was a lot more tolerable to wear.  This waist trainer did feel a bit smaller than the size chart stated but I was able to wear it with a bit of struggle.  It was comfortable on for the first 6 hours but I could not wear it for a longer duration.  I did hand wash this waist trainer and the smell decreased even more but it was still present.  Disclosure : I purchased this item at a discounted price in exchange for my.  honest unbiased review. I am not under any obligation to give a 5 star review, if not warranted. If I feel the product is not a 5 star, I would rate it accordingly. If my review has helped you in any way to make a decision please feel free to let me know by clicking on the “YES” button below."
4.0,Zipper had to be replaced but not sure if it was operator error (my daughter is rough on her bags).  Good quality overall.
4.0,"Overall, I'm very impressed with the durability of this band for the price. My only issue is that the black color wore off and exposed the silver after resting my wrist on the table over several weeks."
4.0,"Comfortable, soft, and fits as expected. I went with the dark grey and love it. Definitely recommend."
4.0,I ordered the plus size and they're just a bit snug on my waist. Still incredibly comfortable pants and I'll continue to wear them!
4.0,These are amazing. Fit very and are very soft. True to size and do not rise up the butt.
4.0,I have two pairs of these and they are a great alternative to buying some of the brand names for upwards of 50$. I normally wear a large but after reading reviews I bought a size up and I’m glad I did. They’re really nice for working out and wearing around the house. The only reason I’m not giving it a 5 star is the sizing and the some of fabric has gotten stringy within the first wash but it’s livable.
4.0,"was hoping for more red, but it's a pretty little thing!!"
4.0,Nice shirt good  quality
4.0,"Nice affordable belt,takes a little to get use to."
4.0,Cute comfortable dress. Needs belt loops to keep belt in place. Taking to tailor to have belt loops added. Small section of my belt is not sewn properly and had neon yellow threads coming out of it.
4.0,"I love this ring, it’s super cute! And i get tons of compliments on it. The only downside is that but turns the color of your skin a different color after wearing it all day."
4.0,"&#34;packable&#34; is a misleading description of many hats. They do not snap back into shape as the photo leads you to believe, but arrive buckled and distorted. The solution is to use a travel steamer on the brim and hold it in shape until it dries. Don't fold it up again unless you want to repeat the steaming."
4.0,"I am 5'4 and about 120 lbs and got a medium. Because the waist is more fitted I'm glad I got a medium instead of small. Unfortunately the neck and chest area is too large for me, but I'm not going to both returning because I'm also going to be wearing this with an undershirt because it's sheer. The fabric seems to be good quality but thin enough to see a bra through it (at least in the light beige color that I bought).<br />It's a nice professional looking shirt that I can wear to work. It's light weight enough for hot days, which I like also."
4.0,it kinda runs small depending on your size. I'm a medium and I got an xlarge and it fits just right.
4.0,"I like this watch, once it was fitted it has been great.  The stones are set well, and the face is very well designed.  Very easy to take off and put on, but not flimsy.  The face is also pretty durable, so far no scratches!"
4.0,He wore the jacket in the rain it stuck to his body. Overall he loved the design on the jacket. This jacket would be good for the fall.
4.0,it's great. I like it.
4.0,Nice weight and value
4.0,"Good quality.Just smaller than I thought, but then again I didnt check the size. Perfect for its intended use."
4.0,I was surprised with the fit of this dress. Very pleased with how it looked for vacation. Purchased a small. 5’5” 130# small bust. My one gripe is that the waist belt slipped down with no belt loops.
4.0,As a gift...it needs a box.
4.0,I could focus easier on one princess per shirt - but little girls enjoy them bunched up together!
4.0,"Great for the price. They are a bit larger on the face than I expected. Not for everyday wear because they sit heavy on my nose, but look cute for when I just wear them for a short period of time."
4.0,Very nice crossbody
4.0,"Love this jumpsuit. Only issue is that the moment I opened the package, the button flew out of the bag so I had to sew it back on. Otherwise, fits as expected and very comfy."
4.0,So cute! But the bottom is blue not green. Great for A cups.
4.0,Item was received quickly. The cap fits my head perfectly and has an adjustable strap in the back. Gave it 4 stars on comfort because it tends to slip up the back of my head some and needs more frequent adjusting than my other cap. It however does not slip completely off like some others do.
4.0,Quality shirt. But the size was a bit long. I am usually an XL and this was more like an XLT.
4.0,I returned it.  Will order a larger size
4.0,Works great but does have a tendency to be a bit tricky on the release.
4.0,"I don't review things with an angry mind.  That being said, I am prepared to be fair.<br /><br />These bow biters are not like the ones I had as a kid, these are mechanically functioned with a VERY low level spring. This is not as strong as the locking bow biters I had as a kid. I assume this change is to keep fingers from getting bit.<br /><br />I bought these for my autistic 4 YR old, and in 6 months, she has only broken one pair.  So the plastic is fairly durable.  They do keep her shoes tied, I don't suggest double knots, they might be too fat for the bow biter to swallow.<br /><br />If your child is into untying their shoes, they are just curious, I don't see that as a reason to knock the product.  These work just fine for holding a bow in place, and make a great little shoe accessory for your little one to look at on their feet!"
4.0,This is larger as it states oversized. Very comfortable and looks good!
4.0,Great glasses love them...
4.0,It worked well enough but much thinner than expected.
4.0,"The foot is excessively long, but I'm wearing them and they help."
4.0,"These leggings have a nice tight/smooth fit.  They feel very slick on the outside - almost like a dancewear.  The side pockets are a little higher than what I'm used to - they land over the hip which still works, it's just a little weird for what I'm used to.  The pockets are also slightly smaller than pockets that I've had on other leggings.  Overall, not bad."
4.0,"The unit works well and seems to be well built for the price.  It requires more than the minimum number of revolutions per day to keep my watch wound, but it is a lot better than doing it manually."
4.0,Used these since my Air Force days. Work as intended
4.0,Love this! The colors are amazing and it’s super comfy
4.0,"I usually have headbands that won't stay in place because of my super fine hair. This one fits and doesn't move from where I place it and I don't even have to use hair pins to keep it stationary. This is something new for me. It is a beigy color and the area where it crosses is somewhat big, but it works for me."
4.0,"I bought this with some dehydrated veggies to add a little extra nutrition to my otherwise unhealthy (but so delicious) regular indulgence in Shin Black and Chapagetti ramen noodles. It worked well enough, cooked up easily in my microwaved broth, the pieces were large enough that they were still easy to eat with my chopsticks. It mostly just takes on the flavor of whatever sauce or broth it's cooked in.<br /><br />I didn't love the texture, I guess I was expecting something more substantial, they ended up softer than I expected. This was my first TVP purchase though, so I don't have much to compare it to. It's possible all TVP gets that soft when boiled in ramen broth."
4.0,My son has a high I step so the top of the slipper is right across the top of his foot.
4.0,I am 5' tall and weigh 98 lbs lbs. the small fits perfectly.<br />I love the blouse.
4.0,"According to the size chart I was supposed to order an 8 however, after the item finally arrived the shoe was too big. Once the seller received word of this issue they promptly corrected the issue and sent me a 7.5, which fits perfectly.<br /><br />That's how customer service is done; thank you!"
4.0,They’re great but my feet are very very small. If there was an XS option they would probably work great. As they are they pull off easily in certain poses.
4.0,Very beautiful.  So far gold plating has lasted pretty well but I am keeping away from water and other products to make sure I don't damage it.  Stones are very beautiful and real looking.  I wear with my real diamond and gold wedding ring and matched up really well.  I would buy from this seller again.
4.0,Was just to short
4.0,Does not hold up well in wash. Shrunk some after washing. Hoping does not shrink anymore after next washing.
4.0,They feel cheap but they look great on. Great back up pair.
4.0,"I like the purse, except the outside zipper pocket gets caught in the fabric lining so it is impossible to use that pocket.  Otherwise, it is a good little purse."
4.0,"The dress runs a size smaller than listed. It is very cute and well made, though."
4.0,"Love the bottoms, fits as expected, however the top kind of spreads my boobs apart rather than where they should be or up."
4.0,I bought it for my 9 years old nephew he is slim and wears size 8. I bought size 8 and runs extremely stretch. Colors and quality looks amazing!<br />I'm returning it and buying size 12
4.0,"Cute, classy, well made.  I would have kept it but it perfectly frames a back tattoo that I prefer not show.  Runs slightly large in the chest."
4.0,This is now my &#34;work&#34; bag...  It has a pocket for everything...
4.0,The ring was beautiful and the quality was great however it was way too big :( the sizing runs a little large so I would size down.
4.0,Ok.  So.  This wig is pretty cool.  I'm not a wig connesouer but it frizzed a bit after first wear and had to brush it out gently and strategically to not mess it up.  Put hair spray on it so it holds a lil better too.  So its worth it if you need it for a costume but seems like its too cheap and frizzes to much for regular wear.
4.0,"Very cute, and received as shown.<br />I don't love the plastic barbells, one of them was cute poorly with left over plastic on the rod and made it difficult to get through the ear/to remove the excess.<br />Other than that little fluke, great product! Great price !"
4.0,Love how it fits and the material.
4.0,It was a gift so hopefully they love it
4.0,"This boho swimsuit cover is a nice cover up. I don't like walking around in my two piece, and this cover up is perfect for throwing over my swimsuit and walking around. This means I don't need to change into my clothes if I need to run into the store or getting into the car. I am 5'9 and weigh 135 pounds. Bust is 32A and Hips 38 inches. it covered my bottom area just like the model in the stock photo, so I am pleased with how much it covers. I ordered the white color and you could see my black swimwear underneath it just as expected.<br /><br />When I opened it up, it was wrinkly but that wasn't an issue I just ironed them out. When it gets wet from swimsuit and you sit down it gets wrinkly on the bottom area, but this is expected. It hangs nicely off shoulders and gives it a nice look to it. Around the collar and back, it is scrunched up and very stretchy. The material isn't stretchy, because it is 100% rayon. The arms really give it that boho look! The arms are wide and hang down nicely with its ruffle sleeves and sewing. It is lightweight and comfortable to wear. My reason for 4 stars is due to the small loose threads that I had to cut/trim. There weren't alot, but they were bugging me (OCD a bit). Overall, it is a nice swimsuit cover up and gives me that boho look and looks nice with a large sunhat! (my opinion)<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this boho swimsuit cover up at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for - soft, comfortable and perfect for the holiday season. It fits true to size but I will say that it starts to pill and look a bit worn after only a handful of washes. The pants especially. But you can't tell that bad unless you get close up on it. Overall though I'm very happy with this pajama set."
4.0,"This hat is beautiful! I got a medium and it is a bit roomier than I anticipated, but it still fits well."
4.0,Love the dress but I ordered it too big.. I should of followed the chart..but other than that it's very cute and very comfortable..
4.0,I ordered the wrong color. Shoes are great.
4.0,Size down for a less baggy fit
4.0,"i wear a true 16 so i felt this size would lay on my body prefect,got the  XL this is not as loose as i like, but will work with, it look good"
4.0,Honestly not bad at all. It is fairly heavy which makes you feel like you paid more for it and the &#34;diamons&#34; shine bright!
4.0,"I did notice a difference after using. They really work. The reason for four stars, the cleaning cloth that came with them, started to wipe the coating off. I never used cleaner, or water. I was given a special cleaning cloth by my daughter in law. No more problems with the coating coming off. It feels like silk. Do not know the name."
4.0,I liked it though but I thought the pearls where a bit bigger. But Its still really pretty and looks gorgeous
4.0,"Comfortable, cute and come with  filters."
4.0,It's true to size !!
4.0,"They are dark! Fits well. Feel like cheap plastic, delicate. I bought the same type/style from different vendor for $5. Having a hard time finding those, so I bought these."
4.0,"Product came with the the lenses half way out of the frame. I was able to snap everything into place, and there you go. For a cheap pair of sunglasses, they do the job."
4.0,"The dress itself is pretty, but the size chart provided is not very helpful. I normally where an XL, or 18 so I ordered a size up just in case. It wouldn’t zip across my chest which is a 40”. Everywhere else fit fine though. The lace detailing was very pretty and the material wasn’t too thin. Just disappointed in the sizing."
4.0,This is the style I was looking for but they are just a tad to big for my glasses even though that is the listed size of my lens.  I can still use them and they work just as I hoped.
4.0,Very pretty.  She loved it very much.  It was a bit smaller than i imagined but still very pretty and subtle enough to wear any day.
4.0,"Bought for my son as he requested a chain for Christmas.  I was impressed by the quality relative to the price.  However, the packaging is extremely cheap looking so I needed to repackage the chain before I could give to my son. He liked the necklace and is pleased with it."
4.0,"Super cute, but I wish product designers could get goat pupils correct for once."
4.0,This watch is very nice ! It was such a great deal ! Shipped on time
4.0,This shirt is very pretty and flattering but is a little tighter than I expected.
4.0,"This bag is spacious and tough. The right number and arrangement of pockets for a rucksack. I took a star off because of the stupid &#34;magnetic&#34; clasps.<br /><br />If I wanted the straps to hang uselessly I would just not use the buckles, but the buckles are cosmetic. They actually &#34;attach&#34; using little magnets that don't stay connected. So they're more expensive than buckles but less functional. The top has a drawstring and the side pockets mostly stay closed on their own, so it's not a deal breaker."
4.0,"loved it, too small in the breasts.<br />size small 32 DD"
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34;, 125 lbs. I normally wear sizes 2-4. This dress fit me well. The fabric is slightly thinner than I anticipated."
4.0,"Es un reloj elegante para vestir con atuendo casual , elegante y formal"
4.0,"I have only had this strap for a few months, but I get the impression it will last forever. It is very stiff at first, but loosens up after some regular use. I like it because you can slide the buckle up on the side of your wrist, or anywhere you prefer."
4.0,My husband likes the cut of this shirt and I think it looks great on him. It is not big and boxy like many shirts. I thought that it would be close to wrinkle free but it's not.
4.0,"Nice, comfortable sandals. Fit as expected. Light weight. Suitable for home, beach, street. Not too classy but nice, neat look. A bit too pricey for overall product."
4.0,It was a longer than expected dress<br /> I had to alter the length. The fabric is a bit see through but the material was not heavy. Good for hot weather.
4.0,"I love these... They're so cute. However, I'm only giving them four stars because of the sloppy glue work. Mine came with a big glob of glue stuck to the strap."
4.0,...and it fits true to their size chart. I’m giving 4 instead of 5 stars because the photo shows short sleeves and they sent me long sleeves ones. Unfortunately I can’t wait for the right one to arrive so I’ll keep this one.
4.0,Pretty Cool Cufflinks
4.0,"Bought it as a gift and overall, it was good. It was large enough to fit lots of cash and cards, but small enough to fit a pocket. Only issue was the floppiness of the wallet. Once open, it can fly around anywhere because it was so floppy."
4.0,decent sunglasses for the money
4.0,Nice causal look and very comfy.
4.0,"Beautiful bracelet.  I've been wearing it for several weeks now. It's dainty, well made, comfortable, and goes with everything. 4 stars because it says 14k dip but there is no stamping anywhere on the hardware so who knows if it really is. Still very nice and a great gift."
4.0,Nicely made but a bit too low on the waist
4.0,the dress was super cute and true to size but shipping took forever (past when amazon originally stated) and it wasn’t here in time for what i needed it for.
4.0,I liked the colors and flow.
4.0,The shoes fit a 6.5 and possibly a size 7 foot. I wear a 6.5 and like a little room to move my toes so they fit me great.
4.0,Cute!!! A little big but can be dressed up or down.
4.0,"This costume was a HIT this year for me. I love silly casual costumes that aren't too cumbersome to wear but will get reactions. This costume is pretty well made and is cozy and soft, the headpiece is seriously like putting a soft pillow on your head, as stuffy as it sounds(which kind of is but it's not too bad). The hand and feet openings make the body part of the costume pretty breathable as long as you're not in a super crowded stuffy room or building. You can see a good amount facing forward with the headpiece on, you do lose some of your peripheral vision though, and I would look down when having to walk up onto and down from curbs just to be safe. I did drive and was able to drive with this on late at night, but I definitely don't advise trying during the busy day times. What you see is what you get for the most part, although I have a few problems with this costume.<br />[Cons]<br />-Here's its biggest and really only problem, this inside and outside of the body piece sheds like CRAZY. The headpiece doesn't do this too much thankfully. Seriously don't wear any of your decent clothes while wearing this, patches of fur will get stuck to every inch of your clothes, I have a lot of vacuuming in my car to do after Halloween is over. I'd feel bad laying down on anybodies couch as such, I only wore this to outside events.<br />-I probably got really unlucky so this might not apply to everyone, but the zipper is incredibly cheap. After trying it on for the second time the zipper completely came off right before an event I was going to, I was luckily able to hold the back with a few clothespins and I got a tailor to fix it with a stronger zipper for cheap.<br />-This zips up from the back, so if you're going somewhere you'll need someone with you to help carry your phone/wallet. Its possible to zip yourself up and out by yourself if you do need something from your pockets but its a bit troublesome. I'd suggest wearing a brown fanny pack if you have no one to help you, the plus side is it'll add to the costumes sillyness.<br /><br />In reality, this costume is more like a 3 star due to the horrible shedding alone however I got so many laughs and snickers, compliments, and photos taken going to public Halloween events that any troubles I had were worth it."
4.0,"Needed a pair, for flying and needed something comfy, wouldnt recommend you wearing outside for fun, but maybe around for flying and around house. Packaging came in very professional."
4.0,"Had a pair when I was younger, would like a child’s size as they are a bit too big!"
4.0,My twin girls love their Minnie Mouse hats.
4.0,It was  beautiful dress but I'm big chested therefore it did not fit.
4.0,"Arrived very quickly! I was very pleased with that because it was a present from my boyfriend as part of an anniversary gift. It's even more adorable in person. The detail is and craftsmanship is great. I almost don't want to use it as a coin purse because I don't want it to get dirty! I've put a few coins in here and there but I also use it for Chapstick. If you're debating about adding this to your purse, do it! It's fun and adorable! Only con is it pops out of the inside of my purse when zipped but it's okay because it's a cute accessory and doesn't necessarily need to be in the purse. It can be pure decor!"
4.0,"Cute and good quality, but They run small"
4.0,A LIL TOO BIG FOR WHAT I WAS EXPECTING BUT GOOD GLASSES
4.0,"Pros- lightweight, cute, love the blue ombré look.<br />Cons- not soft, kinda scratchy.<br /><br />Great for a Southern TX winter."
4.0,"Cool glasses. A little big for the face, but sturdy build. Decent buy for 10$"
4.0,"All in all, they are sturdy. I haven't had one break yet. The rings were a bit smaller than I was expecting. The price is a good deal. I'm not sure if ill ever run out of this pack, in any case."
4.0,"Great gift, well made!"
4.0,"Got it for my almost 5 year old. He loves it and it seems warm. It just barely fits him and he’s on the small side, so if you have a larger 5 year old it may be too small. One of the pom poms also came off the first day he wore it."
4.0,"The band appears to have a good quality, but will know better after wearing for some time. Band did appear a bit stiff at first but does soften with wear. And agree with other raters that band is long and not suited for small wrists."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:5560adc1c6ef420a0a697ded7c24cb89]] Got this on a whim, I like the color.<br />I’ve been wearing now for two days, so far it’s super comfortable and stays snug.<br />I’ve worked out and I have no complaints, overall very satisfied with the quality.<br /><br />I wear a size 5 Apple Watch band so my wrist is a little small for this however it’s still comfortable. It will be great for larger wrists too,<br /><br />I tested the straps both ways and it’s easier to close and open with the hook side on the top position of the watch."
4.0,I ordered a XL which came as a 14 it’s bigger than expected because here a XL is a 13 and that’s what size I am the sleeves are long on me and the coat goes past my knees I’m actually short so.....
4.0,"This outfit is so pretty, but just a little rough material wise.  It might soften up after washing."
4.0,I got this product quickly which I really liked. It was what I expected. It is slightly longer then I need for my tragus piercing but the extra length works when putting the ring in. I had slight difficulty getting the ball twisted on but not ridiculously difficult. The ball feels very secure and I'm not worried that it will loosen and get lost. It does not glow in the dark. At least not that I have found. It may need to be &#34;charged&#34; by sitting under a lamp but I haven't done that. I like it none the less and would recommend it even without the glow in the dark feature.
4.0,Love the bright colors buts a little big
4.0,These are super light weight and I thought they were slip on (they are not).  They are really comfortable.  But I ordered size 12 and these are actually 11.5.  In kids feet that 0.5 makes a big difference.  I would order a size up.
4.0,This pendant is small but is good for the price because it is silver. The chain looks nice too ....
4.0,"They are nice and original brand name, however they are thinner than the ones I got with my watches."
4.0,"Love the look of this Russian hat. Warm, stylish.  Only hesitation is the buckle strap under the chin.  Kind of hard to snap and not the most comfortable, but otherwise this is a winner."
4.0,"Its little small, but overall liked it"
4.0,"They are great, some I received were folded and unable to use. But were still great."
4.0,"okay, trim outweighs blouse material."
4.0,"The yoga pants fit exactly like I expected. I am between a medium and a large, so I did go with my size on the smaller end because I didn't want them to be loose. So they are a little tight but I was ready for that to be the case.<br />My only issue is that they are more of a green-gray than an actual gray, but that is a minor issue and they still serve their purpose."
4.0,"Given the price of these belts, I’m impressed with the quality! Nice packaging but lots of plastic. I should have ordered a size larger than my jean size but it’ll work!"
4.0,"Solid case, delivered as described. Interior plastic covering the hinges has already shown some wear and discoloration but otherwise a solid case that seems to protect glasses well."
4.0,"A nice quality product except that I would prefer not having the side clip on the item. For this price, I would have liked either the option to order it without the clip or for the clip to be removable if you don't want to use it. I deducted a star because of the clip. The case does fit oversized eyeglasses."
4.0,"Took these on vacation in my backpack - lighter than carrying an umbrella, kept me and my bag dry.  of course, no coverage for the face but can't beat the convenience.  on one stop of our tour, i was able to walk around and take pictures while my travel buds stayed dry on the tour bus, so i would recommend, esp. for tourists/travelers.  Hung it to dry in the hotel so I didn't have to dispose any yet - so can get multiple uses out of one."
4.0,Nice for winter.
4.0,"I knew from the comments what to expect and luckily it was the type of jacket I was going for, however most of the pictures are very misleading. The only accurate photo is with the model wearing it. You can see it is a much thinner and formless jacket than the other pictures suggest<br /><br />I like it though. It is Nike so it is well made and it is an excellent casual jacket"
4.0,I wanted something made from cotton not nylon or polyester.
4.0,These pants are cute and look good with a tight shirt but they’re pretty rough. I wish the material was a little softer and they were a little longer. If you don’t have very long legs though they’d probably fit perfectly!
4.0,I just received my pkg n they were not pkg great they were in a box n some were broken
4.0,This is a replacement for the last one I ordered it was way to fat to put in my nose or even my ears. So Amazon refunded my money and I reordered. This one is much thinner and fit pretty good. If it was a wee tad thinner it would be perfect fitting. Also a little smaller ring so too n it would be perfect..<br />The first one I put in I could not get it to click closed. So being that I put the hinged part in first I thought well maybe that moved it of center n that could be the issue. So I removed it . I put the 2nd one in.. with the none hinged side.. a little harder to get in but I did get it in. At first I couldn't get it to click closed also.. but another 45 seconds or so and it clicked closed.  So it's in and so far so good.  I guess if it was thinner it would be easier to get bent. This looks and feels great so far and this time I am pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"These are cool! Not the cheapest relative to other Plastic sunglasses of the same nature, but these look the best."
4.0,I love the way this looks on me and fits very well and do not shrink.  The only think I do not like are the pockets.  They are not deep at all.  You can tell this by the picture if you look at where the tip of his fingers are.  That's where it stops.  There are no back pockets either so there is no way for you to carry a wallet or cell phone with these pants.  Hence the 4 star rating.
4.0,Size is great and all zippers work. I haven't used it yet but the design is exactly as described.
4.0,"It really looks like a mans ring.The "" stone"" is a faint blue.But overall its a good looking ring."
4.0,Nice but needs bigger packets and liner.
4.0,It looks just like the picture.  For around $4 I think it's worth it.
4.0,It’s super cute wish it wasn’t so cropped but that’s okay a lot of people like that!
4.0,"I am 5'0 and 112 lbs and these leggins were a little bit long.  But overall I really liked them.  You'll notice the band around the waist, thighs, ankles in the picture looks like ""dirty"" snow.  Looks ok in the picture, but I didn't care for it in person.  These pants are super soft.  I recommend."
4.0,"Shirt took far too long to come ordered the short in my sons size it arrived 2 sizes too small .. My son really wanted the short ended up taking it to my tailor adjust it to fit .. After the first wash it gathered several lint balls , Beautiful shirt however not worth the money .."
4.0,"I ordered the xx-large per the product sizing chart, based on my bust size.  It was too large.  I returned  it & ordered 1 size down & it is perfect.  The colours are beautiful & more vibrant than the picture.  The fabric is soft & well stitched.  A lovely dress."
4.0,"Very pretty bag, but was too big for me, so I gave it to one of my daughters."
4.0,"Too shinny that makes it look like plastic, beautiful watch it"
4.0,"When I got the item I was very happy to see what was advertised! And the details in the sculpting was immaculate, the only problem was that it wasn’t highlighted by darker areas, so it didn’t really pop from afar. So I painted it and it ended up looking great! In the end, I would only recommend it if you are willing to paint it."
4.0,This skirt is definitely floor length. The idea was to be more like the photos but when i put it on it seemed more perfect for a halloween costume. It reminded me of Lydia in Beetlejuice.
4.0,"I bought this jacket to wear on its own, but also to wear under a heavy coat as an extra layer. The jacket is very warm and light, I also like its style and how it fits a lot. There are two inside pockets (without zippers). But anything I wear under this jacket gets covered with feathers/down. I would still buy it though."
4.0,I am 6' 170 lbs.  the costume fits perfect.
4.0,"A little heavy, need to get use to it"
4.0,"I enjoy these earrings. Well made, quality metal. There is no &#34;back&#34; to the earring, as in, each earring is two parts connected by the screw-in rod; so each earring is three separate parts. This can be annoying when the rod unscrew out of the wrong end and you have to put in your earring backwards. This DOESN'T change how tight it screws though. These earrings have never loosened or fallen out."
4.0,"They fit me perfectly 5’3” 120<br />Only reason I took off 1 star was material seemed a bit inexpensive for the price, but would buy again."
4.0,Very sexy & delicate..it does change copper brown when wet..but it’s still a pretty bronze color instead of gold..gets tangled easily so be careful
4.0,"Nice shirt and it's supposed to be flowy, but the Medium I ordered fits like I'd expect an extra large to fit. Definitely order down a size or two"
4.0,Tail is light and fluffy and perfevt. The ears are too close together and look rather silly.
4.0,Great for the price. It stays nice and snug and stays warm on the face. Still haves issues fogging up if my mouth is not covered up.
4.0,"I'm 5'3, 130 pounds, the small fit well but snug.  If you are any bigger than that, definitely go for the medium.  I am very happy with them, the material is stretchy and does not leave a gap in the back like most jean shorts do.  I wish they were a little longer in length but I know that's the style these days."
4.0,"I have never tried a swimming suit that had a neckline like this, so I thought what the heck! It may work out for me. And guess what, it did!<br />I am 5' 5&#34;, 135 pounds, size 5 pant and 36B bra.<br />I ordered a medium of this product because the bottoms tend to run small and the tops run large (as I've noticed from most swimming suits). When I got the suit, I was spot on about the bottoms, they fit perfectly, but the top ran pretty big. I could almost fit a fist between my ribs and the fabric. BUT, it looked great on me and the cups in the top are very nice and removable. I ended up washing the top in hot water to help shrink it down and I took it in a little bit with some thread and it looks great! I love the fabric and how vibrant the colors are.<br />I would suggest to the buyer of this product to really chose between the bottoms or the top fitting, if you already have swimming bottoms that you like, get a top 1 size smaller than you'd usually order, but if you want both the top and bottom and don't mind doing some work to get the top to fit, order the size of bottoms that would fit you."
4.0,The sea turtle design and the colors are very pretty.
4.0,This is really cute and just as advertised.  I am 5'2 and it has plenty of length to add a belt.  I wanted a lularoe carly and this is a perfect cheaper alternative.  I ordered up 1 size after reading reviews and I really think I could have went with my normal size small.  Only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have not washed it yet.
4.0,"Perly Store High Waisted Leggings for Women - Ultra Soft Opaque Tummy Control Yoga Pants - Regular<br />""<br />Have to say - I changed my opinion once I put these leggings on. I ordered the regular size or ""one size fits all"". I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. When I measured the waist and saw it was 23 inches I thought there was no way these would fit let alone feel comfortable. Boy was I wrong. They are very soft and stretchy and feel great on! Super comfortable!<br /><br />These leggings remind me of the print type leggings that were so popular a few years ago. Nice material and they have tummy control in the front, yet not too tight feeling in the legs. I really like these! Big Plus, they are even long enough! 4 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful!"
4.0,They're cute and comfort !! Also can't beat the price !!
4.0,"This dress is adorable, but it runs big. I am 155, 5ft 1inch, and it was too big. I couldn’t even make it work with a belt even though I loved it, I returned it and ordered a Med… fingers crossed 🤞"
4.0,These shoes are so cute. Not the comfiest shoes to ever walk the planet (haha) but they're very stylish. The heel isn't too high that it's a pain to walk.
4.0,"I worse this bra as a bridesmaid with a backless dress. Unfortunately, being a 36C I am the type that does need to wear a bra. However, once I played around with placement I was able to get the cleavage I was hoping for. Similar to false eye lashes, it takes a few minutes to get used to wearing the adhesive but then it was a set and forget! Worked well even in 75 degree weather without peeling! Hope this helps!!"
4.0,The color in the pic is very accurate. Quality is on par with the price.
4.0,A bit large but they send tool to help fix that and a n extra link
4.0,"Fits nicely, but was a little itchy after wearing it for some time. Could be because of my sensitive skin."
4.0,"I ordered these because of the Tik Tok hype.  I wear and 18 and selected the XXL.  They fit comfortably.  I put them on and just acted casual in the kitchen.  When my husband saw me he said, “Babe!  You can’t wear those out of the house, they look too good!”  They wash nicely too.  The v in the front of the waistband is really comfortable.  If you have thick thighs you the texture is a little uncomfortable as it rubs between the thighs."
4.0,"Im 5'4 175lbs.<br />I got an XXL (crazy huh, who sizes these things?)<br />The top fits great the bottom is too big i tied the back with a small rubberband and this is the outcome.<br /><br />I do LOVE the way it fits and it covers almost of my mommy marks."
4.0,It worked pretty well. It was able to get into the tiny spaces in the setting.
4.0,Good overall for the cost. The material was not the greatest but it was for a costume so it still fit well
4.0,Bought them for my son for baseball. Hopefully he wears them. Playing a little first base so possible he will. There nice too.
4.0,"its a little too big so i had to sinch it, but i like it."
4.0,My niece really likes it
4.0,"Super cute, too small. I'll order again, two sizes larger."
4.0,..the buttons on opposite side and shoulders are wider and making it longer tells it is actually a mans shirt Overall fits great. Nice fabric. Would purchase again if they had any in stock.  I'm 5ft 7 130lbs and purchased a large for loose fit.
4.0,Great product but not true to size order 1 size up
4.0,They fit but my foot is a bit wider. They were a hit with my 1920's gangster outfit though.
4.0,I liked the dress but had to send it back because it was too snug.
4.0,"It can be dressed up or down. I bought md, im 5'4 130 lbs and small bust, fits great just"
4.0,"This bag is nice. Not too big, but at the same time not too small. Very light weight. Material is very thin (like a windbreaker), but it seems very sturdy. I was also pleased when a couple of weeks later I received a bonus running belt complimentary."
4.0,I really loved this cover up just hate that they didn’t give much room for the boob area. I ordered a medium which fit everywhere except chest.
4.0,"It's a very pretty dress but it was a bit too starchy for me. The lace was also a bit too thick for my taste, but others may love it more."
4.0,"I like the material of the shirt, but way to big!<br />Had to return."
4.0,"My first impression was not good, since Draper sent me the wrong backboard, but they promptly sent the correct backboard and picked up the wrong one; no diffculties doing this switch. The backboard is excellant; very good qualiy and finishing. It's heavy enough that the ball bounces back very well. It looks good on my 30 year old cemented in the ground pole for which I made brackets to support this backbboard. I bought the Draper heavy duty goal and now have an excellant backboard and goal which will last many more years. I am completely satisfied.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that the backboard description by Draper is very generic, so be careful that you select the correct part number for the backboard you want. I triple checked the part number before I ordered, and as I had mentioned Draper sent me the wrong backboard! Because of this mistake, I only gave a four star review instead of five."
4.0,glasses way cool and different light up options. only thing that sucks is the cabling for the battery. but nothing i can do about that. cable is long enough to put battery pack in back pocket.
4.0,"Ordered medium. Cups super small, I’m 34 DD would need XL on top and small on bottom. Wish separates were sold as option but the suit is adorable!! Great for smaller chests"
4.0,"Very thin material, but it’s sooo cute on!"
4.0,I have very short legs so they are a bit long but do a great job
4.0,Very cute product at a reasonable price. Quick shipping and packaged well. Received all 100 items. Only two of them had a defect with stars falling out.
4.0,"The collar doesn't seem to want to stay down which is why I gave it four stars. But the fit is actually perfect.  I'm 5'8&#34; and 215lbs and ordered the XL. I was worried it wouldn't fit well but it does.  The material is nice, much better than expected considering the price. It's blue and a soft t-shirt type of material."
4.0,"Me gusta los diseños de la marca Lacoste, generando exclusividad."
4.0,Mine broke:( It was nice while it lasted. Very pretty. Got many compliments.
4.0,Nice top but I need to get a bigger size
4.0,Runs small size up 😁 made tough
4.0,I should have ordered a large . I normally wear a medium but it is a little tight But wearable.
4.0,"Fits good, good quality."
4.0,I would give it a 5 but they ran bigger then I thought they would have even though I read the sizing chart.
4.0,The watch came much faster than expected..everything  is working  beautifully...I'm going to order another for my girlfriend.
4.0,"This is absolutely stunning, it matches the earring perfectly. The chain broke after a few days while I was toweling off from a shower. I did not contact the seller as it wasn't worth the hassle. I suggest buying a separate chain, or using one you already have."
4.0,"I like the design. The softness of the clothing is great too. The pants are longer than my legs (as always), the shirt is a little shorter than I normally like, and that’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
4.0,Beautiful dress!  However it is slightly see through so you will need a slip.  And the dress is more of a peach than pink color as photographed.  Very forgiving in the hips and great fit though!
4.0,Very nice progressive reading glasses. Only negative is the side frames seem a little flimsy. Comes with nice case.
4.0,"These are so cute and my kid loves them.  I would have given a 5star, but the zipper on one shoe is going to need to be repaired already.  It gets stuck and doesn’t zip easily.<br />But the shoes are so nice other that that."
4.0,"they were okay, they do not match exactly my necklace from Italy.  But they will do!"
4.0,I wish there was a hook on the inside to place hangers on.
4.0,"I really like these. I hate shorts normally because I don’t like my legs and they tend to be too short but these are a perfect length. Short enough without looking like you’re wearing long frumpy shorts, if that makes sense. The top can fold down, at 22 weeks I wear them folded down part way since my belly isn’t that big yet. My only complaint is the fabric is thin - the dark grey ones you could see my black underwear, so I would say you have to wear skin tone undies with these (at least I do). Size is spot on, I’m 135lbs at this point and a small fit perfectly."
4.0,"I love the feel of this top. It's very comfortable. The size fits as expected. My only issue is the side split. It's cut is exactly as pictured. I've also included pics. If you raise your arms your skin shows, as I pictured. The only way around it is to keep your arms down or wear a shirt under.  This isn't a deal breaker, but I'd be happier if the slit was lower."
4.0,Price is right. Items do what they are supposed to but may not be convenient for all types of glasses. Depending on the curve of the arms the Keepons may get angled too much.
4.0,"This outfit will be used for a Halloween costume. However, there are swastika sign on one of the sleeves/the back of the shirt and on the pants. This is offensive ...... however, I bought black fabric and sewed it over the swastika sign. I wish the sign was not on the outfit."
4.0,Love this necklace but the chain broke when I was trying to put it on.  I was able to use another chain that I had. But the pendant is perfect!
4.0,They don't wash well. but I still like them.
4.0,"Pretty red, thin material and a little smaller than I would have wanted but I am an 18/20 so that's probably the reason. Arrived quickly and in good shape. Would buy from this vendor again"
4.0,Picture is misleading. Thought Inwas getting two bracelets and only got one. But it was packaged well and received quickly. The quality seems good.
4.0,"This is a cute necklace that seems well made and quality beads. The little elephant is a cute touch. It fits more small than other pull-on bracelets I have. My hands and wrists are not thin or small and not large and this bracelet was small enough to make me concerned it would break when I put it on. It held up fine, but was slightly snug on my wrist. It probably would have been a little longer and fit more easily if the silver beads had been continued all the way around the bracelet, but they stop a little after the edge of the wrist.  If is just the blue beads on the other side of the bracelet.  This looks a little odd when the bracelet moves around the arm during wear and the two sides look different.<br /><br />This bracelet did not come in any gift giving type of bag. It was just a clear plastic bag, so if it is a gift, expect to need to wrap it if you don't want them seeing it right away."
4.0,It’s kind of small
4.0,"Really love the purse, especially how it stands on it’s own and will fit most wallets an Ipad and room for more. Love the color, do not see this color offered on other styles.<br /><br />Reason for the4 stars was the price. I originally bought one for more than half the price. Bought this second one for my daughter in law, she fell in love with mine and she does so much for me I splurged and bought her this one."
4.0,"Runs a little big, I ordered a M and it landed at a weird angle on my knees. Was hoping it would be a little shorter and land just above, but it could be because my boobs aren't very big.<br /><br />Some of these cheap Amazon dresses are terrible quality and this one is just fine and didn't look too cheap. I fixed the problem by pairing it with black heels, a leather coat, and a black scarf to make it look less like a middle school girl outfit. Looked better than expected and got a few compliments on the dress!"
4.0,"Not quite as nice as my leather strap, but it’s comfortable and I like the design. Snug fit feels safe."
4.0,Thin but its nice.
4.0,They are<br />Comfy and have lasted me a long time but the feet are definitely bigger than expected
4.0,"Was looking for something easy to polish jewelry. I read reviews, and like others cut the cloth in 3 pieces for ease of use. Happy so far!"
4.0,The sleeves on this top are about 2 inches too long.  And it attracts everything. Fits well
4.0,My 4 YO loved this set. Everything was so cute. The only dislike about it is the slippers did not last longer than a week before they began to crack and fall apart. Everything else was perfect.
4.0,"These came stacked in a plastic bag with punch holes in it so they were not packaged with sanitization in mind. That being said I have one child (8 years old) who is very picky about masks and doesn’t like the cloth kind. These are his favorite. They fit him well, don’t bother his mouth all day, and he likes the design. If you purchase these and plan for enough time to sanitize before they are being used they are a good buy."
4.0,"The quality of this top was great. My only complaint is sizing. I normally wear a medium, but will order a large next time in a different color. It's not snug, but it as loose as I was expecting either."
4.0,Easy to wear. Light weight. Band doesn’t get cold in your wrist. Easy to see the time.
4.0,The posts are very long ..it’s a good and bad thing because if I sleep in them I get stabbed. And they tend to look like my ears are drooping. But they’re soo pretty
4.0,"I was surprised by how pretty the band is. I don't think it will last as long as the bands directly from Apple, but at this price point, it is definitely worth what I paid. It's very comfortable because it's stretchier than an Apple band. I love it. For whatever reason, my pic won't load."
4.0,I like it but after a week the logo peeled off. Which means I may have problems soon from how it was made.
4.0,Fits well. So comfortable you forget it's there. Not restrictive. Even in hot attics it's not suffocating. Recommended to all coworkers after purchasing.
4.0,Looks like they will be very nice.
4.0,"My wife is a 34D, which is listed as size large. Perhaps we should have known to have ordered a size larger, but a large was not quite as large as expected. The foam pads included were also a bit small and made a bit of an unnatural shape.From a support standpoint, this bra provides about as much support as can be expected for larger breasts.<br /><br />I feel that, for smaller breasts, this would have been a perfect option. For larger breasts, sports bras just have too much to overcome. This one fares well, but is far from perfect.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an honest review*"
4.0,Cute key ring. Durability is questionable.
4.0,"Before receiving it, I didn't realize it was 100% synthetics. I assumed it was cotton<br />However I am not disappointed. It is plush, soft, comfortable and keeps you cozy and warm after a shower on a cold winter evening."
4.0,I wish it was cotton.
4.0,"The dress was absolutely gorgeous. I’m 5’10 and 187 pounds . I ordered an M-US because, I have smaller boobs. The chest area was still very loose . The dress is a little scratchy but, hey it’s worth the price ."
4.0,"Ordered light blue. Arrived as shown in product display and color was correct, but material is a bit sheer—slightly see through on lower half. Fabric doesn’t feel high quality but ok for one or a few wears. Great for a bridal shower, wedding guest dress or formal event. Would recommend for the price"
4.0,"WAY too small, both in cup and band. The product is well made and super cute though so after I return it, I will try again. I hope they offer larger sizes."
4.0,"Very nice fabric, very heavy weight. Length was longer on me than on the model and overall it was slightly too big."
4.0,"Really beautiful shoe, not as comfortable as I was was hoping. I think I'll add some dr scholls to them. They go perfectly with my wedding dress though so I'm very excited about that."
4.0,"Comfy and soft, could be warmer"
4.0,"These are a good cheap polarized option.  I don't get value from the top name brands for $100+, so wanted to try these.  Are they perfect, no.  But they do take the glare down and look good.  I would recommend for those not wanting to pay for name brand lenses.  Albeit these are plastic lenses that scratch easily and get splotchy."
4.0,"I ordered it for my bridesmaids. I love the color, fit perfectly.."
4.0,"This is a nice, well made dress. I've been eyeing on it for some time and took the chance on the Small size since there's no Extra Small size. Basically I'm slim and always size 0 or 00 in all my dresses. It's amazing it doesn't really run so big,  there's just a little extra on the waistline and thinking on wearing a matching wide belt to conceal it. However the sleeves are somewhat loose. Until now, I haven't decided if I have it altered; return or maybe just give it away. Overall, I highly recommend this dress, somebody else will really look pretty on it."
4.0,"I’m typically a 16, so thought the XL would be perfect-and it does fit great and feel comfy but this mom of 4 has a pooch, and these leggings...instead of holding it in, splits in half lengthwise and it’s obviously not flattering! Gifting them to my size 12 sister instead who I’m sure will find them super cozy!"
4.0,"I bought this to replace the smaller, cheaper headpiece that came with my child’s costume. It fits her well (8). It’s much better than I expected."
4.0,"This is a beautiful dress. Fabric was soft. Lace is beautiful. It was, however,  too tight. I returned and will order the next size up. I am hopeful the larger size will fit."
4.0,great sunglasses but it did not come with a case
4.0,This skort is very comfortable and is manufactured very well. They fit my plus size body perfectly. The pocket is convenient. Be mindful of the washing instructions; dry clean or hang to dry.
4.0,one of the few cloths i order online and it actually came as described for the size.Troubles of the Big guy life.
4.0,These pants fit very well got my grandson who is 5ft n on the slender side… the only problem I found is that they are not a true black… they look like they have had some wear to them but not bad… just not a true black. He loves them so that’s all that counts. Would have given 5 stars except for the dull color
4.0,easy match with many tops.  flattering fit.
4.0,very comfortable.  sole isn't very durable can't beat it for the price
4.0,Really  cute
4.0,I love these and will order more. I can't give 5 stars because in one after the first day one underwire and a side support broke through. I sewed the small holes closed but I really wanted it to last longer. The other one I ordered is still staying strong.
4.0,I love the pants but the material is very think and see-thru.
4.0,Have to have the right outfit with this
4.0,"The hood has a great feel and definitely keeps you warm. But, as others have said, very little neck protection.  I use a scarf anyway, so this is no difficulty for me."
4.0,"Very comfortable, and despite how thin the fabric is, it’s pretty warm so suitable for colder months. It is *slightly* see thru when stretched out, similar to leggings. If you’re the type of gal that likes midi skirts then this one is pretty good, especially for the price."
4.0,I think I will use this as more of a cover-up than I will a dress. It is cute and the material seems like it will dry quickly.
4.0,Color was not as pictured. Much lighter in color than shown.
4.0,I bought it as a gift!!! I think she will like it!!! I made a good choice!!! I would wear it myself!!!
4.0,Like my bracelets a lot...……………………..
4.0,Much larger and longer than expected
4.0,It was a birthday gift/she loved it!!!  Great delivery!!!
4.0,They are cute but I can't tell that they keep me any cooler at night then my cotton ones.
4.0,It is not a sweater and not t-shirt material either.  It is a thicker poly blend that is stretchy.  More like a heavy t-shirt.  The design is fun and it has pockets which I loved.
4.0,I purchased the size I normally get but this brand fits larger. The item works ok. Just buy a smaller size.
4.0,"Liked the quality of set overall but it was too hot for me.  Also, thought it was a bit pricey for pajamas."
4.0,Works great to store the hats
4.0,I like them but they’re actually more like 7/16 than1/4. I like them anyway. Thanks!
4.0,Really beautifull
4.0,Love this dress! Very sexy! Can't wait to wear it to my event!
4.0,"is nice , next time i need small ,"
4.0,"Have the pink and floral, just love it so had to get the other colours! Good motivation to drop some weight so it can fit perfectly"
4.0,"I got this back in May for my little sister's 6th birthday and she absolutely loves it. The only thing I would have to complain about is the quality of the material used, but so far, it's been holding up great"
4.0,Seem to fit a bit small
4.0,"This shirt is super cute. But-the small was too snug for me. I almost always wear a small or extra-small. 5’4 110 lbs. 34c. However- I shall return it. I already ordered a medium, hopefully it fits a bit better. The size chart is not too accurate."
4.0,"These are pretty shoes and will look good both at work & play.  However, sizes run small and their construction, especially the patent textures, won't give that ""stretch"" or break-in like other shoes.  So maybe consider a 1/2 or whole size larger.  Can't beat the price either."
4.0,"Very soft, comfortable. I sized up & got a Large, normally buy a Medium but I wanted the extra space."
4.0,"Got tons of compliments for wearing this for a pool party. Unfortunately, it ran a bit small in the chest. Should have given another inch or made it in a stretchy material."
4.0,"The product was fine.  I cancelled it right after I bought it, and bought the burgundy in the same style.  I received both, even after cancellation of the silver.  Keeping the burgundy, trying to return the silver!!!!"
4.0,Good but too small for 10 month old baby
4.0,"Nice, plus good price. Very comfortable."
4.0,"I really like how soft and comfortable this is, I just wish the arms were smaller.  I'm 5'6"", 160# and typically wear a M/L.  I bought the M and found it to be quite oversized."
4.0,"My niece says it's a little itchy in parts, but still wears it!"
4.0,Nice! Light weight. Don't think they're going to be durable 🤔
4.0,The pj fit perfect i love them to pieces! I would  recommend  them to anyone.
4.0,"I'm loving the glasses for the great price I received for them. Every time someone see's me, they automatically think I paid hundreds of dollars for them."
4.0,"Muy corta para mi gusto, pero la tela es fresca"
4.0,I would definitely recommend this wallet it seems to be good quality we will see how it holds up. I am actually going to order another one
4.0,They seem to work well. I secured two pins to a backpack last week and so far so good. My main concern is that the pins (the point sticking out from the back) seem bent from the force of securing the locking mechanism. It doesn’t matter as long as the pin material isn’t damaged but only time will tell.
4.0,I really like the purse.  One of the zippers is a little wonkey but otherwise it’s a nice purse.
4.0,"I still use these, but I must have a small head.  They sort of come to a peak since they are so large. I opted instead to wear headbands with buttons for my mask (to save my ears.)"
4.0,Very good quality but they run a little bit big so I recommend getting a size smaller than normal
4.0,"Cute bracelet. Have had no tarnishing happen and have worn it once or twice a week for a few weeks now, without taking off when washing hands. I will say it's a bit thinner than the name brand and the balls on the ends are smaller than the real as well, but to someone who doesn't know and isn't staring closely, they'd never know. For that reason alone I will likely only wear it with long sleeved tops or sweaters. Cute bracelet overall and worth the price to get the look!"
4.0,My au pair is very happy with this. She is adorable in this shirt.
4.0,These are really cool looking but just be aware that they're quite large. I'm a petite person and these go from my eyebrows to my mid-cheek.
4.0,"Bought this for our neighbor's daughter for her birthday and she LOVES it! It does look snazzy and yet is still functional. Corner protection is good with vice thick rounded corners for absorbing impact from drops.<br /><br />I would give 5 stars however the material at the bottom of the case is thin and mover around a bit. This is due to the holes that are required, but im my opinion, it could have been executed better. Minor gripe but worth stating."
4.0,"I like it very much. The wool is strong and does not fade. This is a good Christmas gift for myself, haha"
4.0,I liked the earrings very much except that they were a bit smaller than I had imagined. M.C.
4.0,"The color is as it seems (I would have prefered a darker tone), but the belt is very nice and exactly as presented."
4.0,"Super cute, runs small size up."
4.0,blocks just the right amount of sound.  Comfortable
4.0,"If you order this, order in a size smaller.  I love it, because, i don't care for clothes fitting me closely. I like the fit, but if you want it to fit you as it looks on the model, order a size smaller."
4.0,"These are great except the clips get in your vision. Shortened them, and now all is great"
4.0,Took a while to get the weird creases out of it from shipping.  The mold-able wire frame at edge is a little flimsy.  Will work fine for a packable sunhat on vacation.
4.0,"Great idea to keep skis and poles in one place. The strap is long enough to swing over the shoulder. Makes it much easier to keep my gear in one place, as I am usually fumbling around with all my gear. The kit comes with 2 sets and one can be used for boots as well. Easy enough to put on and take off with no gloves and in good weather. The problem here, is trying to do this with gloves and bad weather, not so great."
4.0,Cute shirt.  It needs to be ironed each time it is washed and the crocheted parts are fragile.
4.0,"This print is very pretty and the colors seem true to what I expected. The material is a bit thinner than I was anticipating, but I wore this with a slip and it was great! I got a lot of compliments on it!"
4.0,"I will start with the cons;<br />It's definately Heavy, I played Basketball with it on the outside of my shirt and almost lost a tooth when it hit me in the face.<br />If you look at the picture, it's hung by a small metal clip, well don't rely on that clip, it broke within' a week.<br /><br />although I have written some pretty bad things so far, I will now start with the pros;<br />It's a very solid peice, The color is nice and very hard to bend/break.<br />I cannot argue with the price of $9.99USD. The bead chain that comes with it, could be a bit stronger but once again, I cannot complain being as though it's a very cheap peice. it's exactly as described. There for I will rate a 4/5. You deserve all four of the stars, and if by any chance you could start using thicker chains, maybe some more reliable, that would be great.<br />- Kyle"
4.0,Recieved yesterday only.. Good product
4.0,Size of chain for wrist was a bit too large for the 8th Grader I bought it for - maybe sell in different sizes.
4.0,"The colors and cut of this dress are fantastic. The fabric is comfortable and about the quality I'd expect for the price paid. There is no label on the dress that says what it's made of so I'm not sure what it will do when I wash it. I ordered a size small and the sleeves and shoulders fit like a petite size, which is great for me because I'm 5'4.&#34; You may want to order a larger size if you want longer sleeves."
4.0,This fitted as expected. And was comfty.<br />Wore it for pool and beach. I wish the band was a bit narrower. But overall it was a flattering and comfortable bikini set.
4.0,"Fun!  Kids had a blast at my 5yo's bday party. Love that the yellow ones turn on and off easily. Disappointed that the poop Emoji rings are difficult to turn on/off and don't shine very well. For the price, quantity, and fun provided, it's a good deal with prompt delivery."
4.0,"A bit snug around the middle, but another brand the same size fit fine."
4.0,Smaller than I thought but they are okay.
4.0,"Love them, easy to get used to but when you eat you get food stuck under neath them, more for show. But I love them"
4.0,"It did it's job, but I had a hard time keeping my face positioned as they suggested."
4.0,"Very cute, comfortable and figure flattering even on an XXL lady.  The bottom of the blouse does a pleasant job hiding problem areas one might have.  It's easy to put on and looks like the image.  The only reason I gave it 4 start instead of 5, is the space below the armpits, is wide (I just use safety pins to adjust it ).  Overall, I'm happy I purchased this cute top especially as affordable I found it to be."
4.0,"These are cute PJ's, and not quite as slippery as the others I ordered. But I'd like them so much more if they were cotton, and not so stretchy and slippery."
4.0,Para personas delgadas
4.0,"Awesome  Ribbed Tank Top. So comfortable and flattering. The fabric is nice and fits perfectly to your body. Goes with almost any type of shorts, pants etc... The top also doesn't shrink in the wash and doesn't wrinkle. AKIZATY is one brand to keep your eye on for clothes, especially a top like this one.<br /><br />Katiebabs"
4.0,This really only works if you're not curvy. I'm super curvy and i hate how this looks on me. It's way more flattering without curves. I got it for me but gave it to my best friend she loves it and rocks it and she's tall and thin
4.0,"The Packaging was great, The earrings are exactly as shown,just received them today3/8/16 so far so good"
4.0,"This is a great analog watch but as a digital, it isn't the best. You can barely see the displays and the backlight is useless unless you are in total darkness. It seems to keep good time and it is comfortable. The buckle doesn't seem to snag on things like my other cheap watch. Certainly worth the money in any case."
4.0,"I like roomy pjs so I got the 3X, normally a 2X when shopping at a store like Kohl's.  This 3X fits just fine, plenty of room fir tossing and turning.  Just one thing,  the top is a little short.  Not saying it's short.  Comes just below the bellybutton.  Another couple of inches would be perfect :)<br />Me:  5'3&#34;/210#s .. so you have an idea regarding the sizing."
4.0,"The pants fits great for the length of my legs, the only reason I'm giving it four stars is because my waist is small so I constantly have to pull them up because there are no loops for a belt."
4.0,They're great.  Everyone likes to spend big money on waders but these worked just as well as those. They're a little big in the feet and could have more give or room with the inseam.  The measurements are weird so mine are big in the feet and tight in the knees when I sit.
4.0,Very cute top-not a big fan of the bottoms so ill probably switch them out. The top is a lil big but it works. I normally wear size 8/10
4.0,"Nice quality ties, great price. I got a lot of positive compliments on the one I wore and worked for me as a smaller lady. Not too big."
4.0,Not the best quality but perfect for the amount I paid. Great for a one time purchase.
4.0,"I replaced an existing key organizer I had for many years. I Like this type of product,  and this one is a great key organizer. I like how thin it is yet it hides the key. The flexibility to add additional keys with supplied expansion screws is a nice touch. It went together fairly easy. I found if you place at least 1 spacer on each side of key this ensures the keys do not move in the organizer. It would be easier to assemble if one side of the mounting screw was captive in the frame. The screw threads are small so I suggest you thread screws by hand only and then tighten with a coin, but overall I would recommend this product."
4.0,Well made with breathable fabric. I like it
4.0,"not long enough for me, but my mom loves it"
4.0,"I received premium quality nylon & nitrile garden gloves to try. The material is comfortable with good stretch and is extra thick on the palm side which is great for stability. I was able to get a strong grip around my weeds with them. They say one size fits most, my hands were a bit small but the elastic on the wrist was tight enough to keep them, the excess material did not get in the way. You receive 3 pairs with your purchase which is great because gloves seems to always get lost. I would definitely buy these in the future. #ProSyner"
4.0,Good quality such a cute gift!!
4.0,only negative thing I have to say is it was hard to get closed
4.0,Same as the picture. I am happy with this purchase.
4.0,Asian sizing so order up. Somewhat cheap the metal broke off before even wearing but not necessary. Snug but that's the way I like it.
4.0,Good biking outfit...fits as described.
4.0,the feel of the leather
4.0,"I loved this skirt.  I received many compliments on it.  I liked that the material is a thicker and non-see through.  The only other thing is that when I got the skirt, the areas that I thought were brown; actually turned out to be black.  It did not take away from the pattern, though."
4.0,This is a simple slip on dress for the larger size lady.  The tie front and long vertical pattern has a slimming effect.  It fits per American size.  This dress can be worn for daytime or night.  It's comfortable.
4.0,"These shirts run larger than normal. I originally ordered a medium but it was too big. I returned it and ordered a small and it fits perfectly. I am 5'2&#34; 150 lbs and wear a 38C. I ordered 2 shirts - 1 white and 1 gray. The material is see through so you will have to wear a tank top underneath. If not for that, I would have given it 5 stars."
4.0,Nice material. The top is a bit small. I ordered a medium. I'm 5'2 125 lbs. 34D. The bottom fits great.
4.0,These are adorable I just was kind of suprised with how big they are. They still work though.
4.0,These jeans fit great and are very comfortable. There is enough stretch in the waist so you're not pinched. They don't stretch out and bag like some other jeans.
4.0,"It came weeks early which I loved.got it a size larger to make sure I had plenty of room,could have done a medium though cause its really roomy.love the lace.my only complaint is the hemline had some fringe on it I don't think is in the photo.can trim it off though.otherwise I think it's okay and I like it's casual vibe.the arms lace feels a different texture then the body part but it's still okay."
4.0,I think they run a little small and can be a little see through if they’re too tight. I would order one size up
4.0,"These were purchased as a gift and they look good and fit the person well. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they don't come in a box or anything to make it nice to gift a person. Its in a ziplock bag which I guess is easy for them to ship but makes the ""gift"" look cheap. The exterior material is nice gives the shoes an appearance of quality. the inside material is soft. Hoping they will age well."
4.0,I returned the dress as the fit was a bit snug on me. The construction of the dress looked well made.I wish it would have fit as it was a cute dress with a nice cut on it!
4.0,"Good dress, just a little loose on the straps.  would have preferred and way to cinch it like a bra strap.  but can be altered.  Cant wait to wear it.  makes everything nice and curvy, but smooth"
4.0,"The button that locks the band is hard to turn. Otherwise, Love the product and the price."
4.0,My wife loved this dress. She looked amazing in it!
4.0,"Such a tangy, spicy, and sassy little tee-shirt I just adore all things “Pineapples” and this cute shirt is no exception. I can’t wait until the Spring and Summer months so I can showcase this fruity-tutti fresh and fruity tee! 🍉🍊🍓🍒🍒🍒"
4.0,"I wear a us size 16/18 and this top is pretty big on me. Love the material and it flows nicely, color is pretty close to picture."
4.0,"Good quality.  Band was replaced to nato leather. Crown could be larger for my hand size, but still looks nice."
4.0,I am usually a small but I sized up due liking extra room. I am happy with the quality and fit. Would purchase again in every color.
4.0,Very pretty. Material is soft and stretchy. I am normally a US 12/14 and I ordered a L and it fit well
4.0,"I love the shirts, the colors are nice. I ordered these to wear under my scrubs. However they run a little small. I normally wear a medium (Healing  Hands) but I checked the size chart & so I sized up I should’ve sized up to the xl for them to not be so snug. But overall good compression and nice shirts."
4.0,Nice color and fits great
4.0,Cute watch but a little big for my 4yr old grand daughter. Good way to start learning time!
4.0,"Cute scarf, bought as a gift - exactly what they wanted!"
4.0,Great insert for shoes with little to no support.
4.0,"Great product, but 2 minor issues.<br /><br />1. These do not cover the back of the shirt. They work great for the sides and part of the front, but the back will stick out like a duck tail.<br />2. They dont really follow the curve of the leg. My legs bend in a little bit and every so often I would notice the band through my pants when I was sitting or standing still.<br /><br />Other than that, the product is great and I would use it again. It was my first time using a product like this."
4.0,"But, i do have a small head for a women, other wise I love the stlye.<br />cindy"
4.0,"outstanding job in shipping. very happy, really recommended. will use again for my next child."
4.0,"My wife loves it! The feel of the soft leather make it seem more expensive than it really is. Only one thing she's complained about: the buckle makes access difficult and hard to &#34;lock&#34;, (maybe it was intended that way). A magnetic snap on would have sufficed instead."
4.0,Based on the size chart I ordered the Xl but it was too baggy on me. Even after a wash it was still baggy.  Was good quality. fabric was think enough you couldn't see thro it
4.0,Good quality suit and attractive but I wear a DDD and the cups were way too small.
4.0,It is surprisingly warm for being so thin. It is a big snug most large sizes are big on me.  It says it must be hand washed and hung dry reason I didn't give it 5 stars
4.0,Only received 49 apple charms plus a random dog charm I didn’t order. Rather have the full 50 I ordered.
4.0,"Great customer service. Emailed asking for exact measurements. I was shocked how soon it arrived. The dress did come in very big. I could not have worn it as it came. Luckily the wedding is not until September, so there's time for alterations. It's not that they ignored my measurements- I measured it in all the places that asked and it was correct. The problem is the &#34;waist&#34; hit more at my belly button. Alterations seem simple though. Overall I would buy it again because it's a beautiful dress and it's made well. Just be sure to order it in plenty of time to have it altered!!"
4.0,They just weren't right for me but they are made well.  I love the color!  They didn't have the smaller size in this color so I took a chance.  They were too big. So sizing is probably accurate.
4.0,Nice colors but a bit tight
4.0,"Super cute, light cardigan. Pretty well made but I find it fits really big. I'm usually a medium in most brands - I'm tall and thin. This fits big, it kind of falls off my shoulders. However, I usually wear sweaters like this over tanks and short sleeved shirts. I'm sure if you wear this over long sleeved, thicker shirts it may fare better. However, I love the look and I just clasp it to keep it from falling all the time. Glad I got this."
4.0,We had a similar issue with it breaking. I asked for a refund because I don't want to return it with my dad's ashes in it. They were very nice and said they would ship a new one ASAP.  I'm hopeful this one won't break.
4.0,I'm 5'6 140 Lbs workout and lift weights bought this and the shoulder area is a little small but other than that I really like it.  For just covering up going from the pool to my hotel room its perfect.
4.0,I love them. Can't wait to wear these at Yellow Claw in PCL! WOOOHOOO
4.0,Tre casual short sleeved blue denim bolero fits true to size.
4.0,The bracelet is as described on the web site. I find it difficult to maneuver the loop over the bead in attempting to place it on my wrist and remove it. I also wish it was adjustable insofar as having the ability to increase or decrease the size. I also would like to know if it is colorfast.
4.0,I like the necklace. Thank You
4.0,"This is super cute and very stylish! However, the torso is a little short for me and the material does not feel good. But I still love it."
4.0,A bit wide but very lightweight & comfy
4.0,I like the top..... on the model.  She must be wearing one that was 2 sizes too big for her to have it long in the sleeve and loose like it is.<br />The one I got is too small and does not have any stretch so really not anything I can wear.  Bummer.
4.0,God son love it said he like all of the departments it has for watch.
4.0,"These capris fit a little large and were a little thick.  The photo indicated that they were more of a sage green, but they are actually a darker, hunter green."
4.0,It fit well. I'm a big girl so happy with the fit.
4.0,I love the pink mittens cuz they're warmer than gloves. But they're already have pulls.
4.0,Sleek and warm!
4.0,"I wear it as an anklet because it's so big.  I wish it was smaller, so I could wear as a bracelet."
4.0,"Haven't washed it yet, so don't know how it holds up.  But looks good so far.  A bit big, but that just gives growing room."
4.0,"The 8 cm fit great, the 10 was a little large. I'd wanted this style for awhile but it didn't really work that well. That's entirely on me. I have a small nose with a higher up septum piercing due to rhinoplasty, an 18g piercing which I understand is not the default gauge for most piercings. 16 is. The 10 hung down a tick too far, making me crazy, and the 8 fit great but wasn't that easy to open or close. Still a good value and quality if these aren't your issues."
4.0,"I see better with these than any other sunglasses I have ever had.  They also feel nearly weightless, so I can wear them for hours.  They fit me perfectly, which is unusual.  These wrap around and fix rather closely, providing maximum glare protection.  So far no fogging issue at all.<br /><br />This color is the one for driving/flying since it increases contrast - safer (and a very pleasant effect that makes you feel you are &#34;looking at the world through rose colored glasses&#34; when the color of flowers and the sky pops out).  One issue you need to know.  The sunglasses are pretty think when folded.  The hard case that comes with them is really thick as a result and heavy - the case will not fit in pockets or roof car sunglass holders.  The sunglasses themselves may fit.<br /><br />Update: The best I have ever tried, but it turns out rather fragile.  Dropped out on my pocket and I stepped on them, the lenses shattered in hundreds of pieces.  The frame was ok except for a scratch.  Deducting one star for this, although I will reorder.  I took them on a long trip and often forgot I had them on even when shooting pictures with an SLR - a first for me."
4.0,"A tad bigger than expected, other than that a good purchase."
4.0,"Based on other reviews, I purchased this shoe a full size larger than I normally wear. This was a good decision since this shoes ran even smaller than I expected and I wanted to be able to wear a hefty wool sock for the added insulation. The fit is acceptable. I really like the shoes and consider them a good value for the price."
4.0,I bought this dress for my trip to Dubai. The green is pretty and the material is nice.
4.0,Works like it’s supposed to. I did sweat more in my belly area while working out on the treadmill. Just size up because it does run pretty small.
4.0,"Couldn't beat the price, wore it twice now, fits and feels good. Impressed with the packaging. I would order another one for 10 bucks!"
4.0,"Nice thin, no show socks that fit my foot well. I wear these with tennis shoes and they are on the thinner side but help keep my feet from sweating too much"
4.0,The black exterior scratches semi easily but for the price I like it. I don't feel guilty about losing a $12 band
4.0,"Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he gets compliments on the bright colors and beautiful artwork anytime he wears it out. He's 6' and slender with long-ish arms, and the medium fit him really well- not baggy at all"
4.0,I wear a medium tshirt but al the ones I tried have been so tight. I ordered a large and it’s to big.
4.0,Wonderfully hat came as described and no wear and tear through transit. I didn't give five stars because I had a little problem with it reaching to my USA address on time because it had to be further shipped overseas to me. But all and all I got it and looks wonderful.
4.0,Like the compartments. Great work bag.
4.0,"I loved it! Good quality, seller sent it on time and it is as is shown.<br /><br />I am a size M and it looks a little bit big but still look good I love it!"
4.0,Beautiful but made bad soon ass i put it on a strap broke but idc im going to just sew in back on but overall im satisfied
4.0,Only 4 stars due to price. The shirt does feel like it is doing something. I can feel my back muscles engaging and I’m a bit sore the next day after wearing for a few hours.
4.0,"Good quality.<br />The only problem, when I ordered there was no size indicated.<br />When I received the package, they were small."
4.0,"Perfect shirt since I wanted something not too fitted. The design is nice, just not quite as identical to the picture. But I'm very pleased about the fit. The medium was perfect for me. Plenty of room to layer underneath."
4.0,We like nice little girl dresses shoe
4.0,Material is comfy.<br /><br />I like the style and cut.<br /><br />Pretty good deal for the price.
4.0,A little long but that standard for me.
4.0,"Rolex charges $1250 for a new 904L stainless steel oyster bracelet.  This is essentially identical except for the lack of a crown emblem.  It fit my Rolex Submariner perfectly, looks great, and saved me over $1200 on a replacement bracelet when mine broke.  Score!"
4.0,"My husband is farsighted and his eyes are sensitive. He wears prescription glasses with bifocals, and had to wear bulky sunglasses that fit over his regular glasses, because Doc said they could not tint bifocals. He has prescription sunglasses, but without the bifocals, which makes it difficult if he has to use his GPS, or read a Google map while driving. He can actually drive without his glasses now, wearing these sunglasses with the addition of the bifocals for close up reading.<br /><br />He also wears them indoors when he's using his tablet. The screen is bright enough to cause him to squint, but if he dims it and wears his regular glasses, it is difficult to read. These sunglasses allow him to keep the brightness and read without squinting.<br /><br />They fit snug on his face. The arms are nice and tight even though they are not spring loaded. If he turns his head quickly or looks straight down, they stay in place. They are comfortable and lightweight and he highly recommends them for people in his situation."
4.0,"Cute. Silky on one side, a little polyessterish on the other."
4.0,"These fit great, so soft. Weird smell."
4.0,Great accessories for my Cleopatra costume!  Would recommend wearing a short style dress so the leg pieces are seen better.
4.0,quick delivery and price was great! bargain
4.0,"i love these flip flops, just be carefull odering your size, it runs very big. i am size 8, but these size 6 fits me."
4.0,Great shirt - perfect for our upcoming beach vacation.  Buy one size larger than normal... Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5
4.0,This cz bracelet is lovley. Delicate and very sparkly. Its size is perfect to wear with my watch or alone. The packaging was very nice to give as a gift. I do wish the lobster clasp was a little bigger. Its a little hard to handle.
4.0,"Cute little bracelet.  Not very heavy, but it works for my 7 year old grand daughter.  Size was just right."
4.0,"My granddaughter is 4 months old. I bought this as a Christmas gift from her to her mother.  I can’t wait for my daughter to see it. It is very sweet and delicate. I got the box chain which really goes with it better than I think a ball or link chain would. The birthstone is a very pretty clear red color. I was worried the stone would be cloudy and cheap looking, but it’s not."
4.0,"Nice but a little too thin for all of the stuff my wife carries around. Had a hard time getting everything in it. Bought something else next day. It's a nice enough wallet, and the company is nice to deal with, it just wasn't the right wallet for her."
4.0,Fits like a US Large but short. Material is nice. Design is nice.
4.0,Beautiful print and color. Very pretty!
4.0,"This dress fit me as I thought it would, and it’s a fun design. Definitely cheap material, but it’s a cheap dress! It’ll be fun to wear at a concert this summer."
4.0,love the light and delicate look and feel
4.0,"The pendant is small but sturdy and held the expected amount. I love the quality of the pendant itself, but I wish there had been more options for chain sizes."
4.0,"I gave 4 stars because a small was recommended so that is what I ordered.  The item was too small.  The straps were very tight around my neck and it the top also sat above my waistline almost like a crop top so I am going to get a large instead. I’m 5’5” and 120lbs.  Also, The material is very soft and comfy but it is sheer.  You would need something underneath the top unless you don’t mind showing your stuff."
4.0,It is thin but my little girl likes it.
4.0,My granddaughters wedding
4.0,I needed some ankle boots and liked how these resembled doc martens so I decided to get them. So far so good. They are very light weight and size 7 was perfect (usually I get a half size up for boots) so it was true to size for me. They seem comfortable enough though I haven’t wore them all day. Very cute with skinny jeans. I hope they hold up!
4.0,More Bright Gold than pictured. But still nice.
4.0,"They are snug but not tight. Very high waist, folds a bit when doing anything seated. Not see through at all. Pockets are awesome!!!"
4.0,"These glasses look exactly as advertised, but what really surprised me was the difference between their look and the way they feel.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The glasses came in a small drawstring bag for added protection and they were in good shape when I received them. I simply cleaned them with a mild cleanser and they were good to wear.<br /><br />LOOK:<br />They looked really good on me: Not too big, not too small. They also kind of look like the glasses a friend of mine once bought from H & M. To see if they were in fact unisex glasses, I let my brother try them on and they did not look feminine on him.<br /><br />FEEL:<br />They did feel kind of cheap, but as advertised, the frame and lens are indeed made of plastic. This only affected my opinion of the glasses slightly as most glasses are made like this.<br /><br />Overall, these glasses are very cool looking and would be perfect to wear at festivals, concerts, or even occasional summer wear.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discounted price or free for evaluation purposes in return for my unbiased review, which I have provided here. I do not have a relationship with the seller or company, and have not been compensated for my review. The opinions stated here are my own and based on my personal use/opinion of the product."
4.0,"Nice earrings, excellent quality pearls. No visible abrasians at all, and a gorgeous silvery color.<br /><br />I bought these earrings and a 9mm pendant to match it,  after receiving both the pendant was the highlight, that being said these are really nice and match.<br /><br />The Pearl Source was super helpful with questions I had, with great customer service all the way around."
4.0,"They were out of blue and black, and already had a grey.  The vest is comfortable for all around use, I'm just disappointed in the color."
4.0,I love the purse but gave it 4 stars because the inside divider section tore away from the body of the purse. I love that it's light weight and spacious so I kept it. Perhaps it was just a defect in this bag.
4.0,"Great quality jacket, very warm, very soft and comfortable. A little snug when zipped up."
4.0,"Love them , only thing I did not realize how thin they were and have to wear a skirt or very long shirt since you can see through them"
4.0,"This is a good fit and has some pretty good support. Not the most flattering look for big boobs though. At least not mine. I'm 4'10, 95 lbs, 32D. It Looks kinda weird on me. It is well made and if my boobs were at least a cup size smaller it would look great."
4.0,This is a beautiful that works great.  It looks and feels expensive but is not.  I think it was a very good buy.
4.0,I still really like these earrings and they are decent quality for the price- but they are so off white they are almost a tan/khaki color rather than white.
4.0,"I got this for myself and it came slightly more rose gold than the picture suggests and the eyes and head are different, but it is slightly adjustable and I can make it fit for each of my fingers. Even though the picture is different, the quality is pretty good."
4.0,"Pretty awesome. Totally wind proof and water proof. I rode with these several times while it was actively snowing. I noticed they're a little too warm if the temp is closer to 40 degrees F, but perfect for anywhere around freezing and actually below freezing as well. I rode comfortably around 22 degrees F going around 85 mpg on the highway and was totally comfortable. The only downside to these is the padding is pretty thick and takes getting used to to pull the clutch and twist the throttle. I'd recommend riding around the neighborhood a little first, to get a feel for what you can sense with your hands, as well and how much dexterity they allow you. They also don't have and armor or protection if you fell, but you can see that from the product pictures."
4.0,"It feels nice and it's perfect for post-shower roaming. It's light but absorbable. Not too much, even in the summer."
4.0,"While the packaging says it is all one waist size, the shorts vary in size."
4.0,"These are very nice earrings. A little smaller than I expected, but they seem to have good color. They are for a young woman, so they should be great despite the size."
4.0,The head wrap fits great and has a double layer or lace.  The wrap is wide as shown and may be to much for shorter hair.
4.0,Wish I could exchange it for the next size up
4.0,Would have gave 5 stars if it wasn't for the smell. Must wash prior to giving it at the baby shower. Other then that super cute. Well made.
4.0,These are as described but are really thick and bulky. But they are warm. I still like them because regular scarves are always falling off. But they are kinda’ bulky if you are trying to pack light.
4.0,"Love this dress! It’s shear so wear something under it. I’m 5’6” 130lbs, Small chest, bigger bottom and I ordered a small and it fits perfect."
4.0,"Beautiful, but broke after a couple of days =/"
4.0,Great quality. One of my fav tees.
4.0,"This is okay.. colors are very bright. Don’t like the way my fabric looks at the seam in the back.. kinda has big medallion things on my bum. Comfy and fun, though."
4.0,"I wore them to gym and had no issue, and received several compliments. The fit was perfect. They are high waisted which I like.  The material is thick and stretchy, breathable"
4.0,"KINDA STIFF- BUT STILL NEW, MY OLD BELT IS FALLING APART"
4.0,"Nice for the price, just don't tie it to tight and make any sudden action when untieing it."
4.0,For $8 it's what you would expect.
4.0,shorts size a little small
4.0,Good quality but they are a lot smaller than advertised. John Lennon style.
4.0,I though it'd be a little bigger bUT it fits snugly. Not a bad thing just a little small for me and my super thick hair.
4.0,Great bag with lots of compartments and pockets to store whatever you need fore the gym. The only negative was where the shoulder strap is attached to the bag is not strong it ripped  off the first week of use. The rest of the bag is ruggedly built. This is the ONLY reason I did not give the product a 5 star rating. All in all a good buy. I would recommend  this product.
4.0,Had to wear when he was a couple months old
4.0,"I'm 5'5"" and 180 lbs and the Large fit me just fine. The leggings hit just a little above my ankle bone and the waist is just about at my belly button, maybe a smidge higher. When they say compression they definitely mean it, but not in a bad way. They also wick moisture really well. I sweat ALOT and I checked all over my legs and undercarriage for any signs of sweat stains and there were none - VERY happy about that. The only real ""issue"" is that I had to hop a little to get the leggings over my butt. I'll report back if the chub rub wears through the thighs at an usually quick pace.<br /><br />I did about a 2 mile run, stretched, and they leggings never budged. They didn't ride up in the leg like some leggings do, or drop in the waist, they stayed exactly where they started. I also really like that the pockets are SUPER deep. I have a S9+ and the pocket is deep enough that my phone is completely covered and has a little extra room - it's great. They also have a super deep pocket in the waist band, so if you don't feel comfortable putting your credit card, locker key, car key, etc in your leg pocket they will totally fit in there."
4.0,Te mantiene calientita y seca.  Buena calidad del producto.  Solo la talla es más pequeña del promedio.
4.0,"These are a pretty color, as well as unique -"
4.0,Very cute and good price but takes a while for delivery
4.0,"This is a lightweight rain jacket with nice striped accents (hood, pull cords). The hood can be pulled tight around you face and similarly, the waist can be tightened with pull cords as well. For me, this 2XL is fitted enough when closed that I wouldn't have a need to tighten anything. The button front pockets are just decorative - the real pockets behind them don't button. The sleeves are a great length, but have no elastic, button, or velcro so you can't tighten them. For a regular jacket, it's no big deal, but it matters when it's a rain jacket as you don't want the water to get in. Nonetheless, if you're just using this to run errands or wear from door to door, it's fine. Navy is always a great color for a rain jacket and my favorite part is that it covers my butt, so if I sit or lean on something outside (while waiting for a train or bus), I won't get wet!"
4.0,Very cute and I have gotten lots of compliments. Love the ability to care it on my shoulder or over my neck. However I didnt realize it was so small that my wallet and Stylo cell phone pretty well fill it up.
4.0,The quality of the Du-rag is top notch but I should have paid close attention to the in seam.(the line is in the Du-rag). So I gave it to my girl.
4.0,I have the real ones these are a decent dupe if u style them Right
4.0,Really well
4.0,"Large, but a favorite!!!"
4.0,My son wanted this for Christmas. It is a well-made necklace and looks very nice. It was just a little bigger than I expected.
4.0,I didn't expect the material to be what it was
4.0,Super cute. I wore them to the beach and even in some choppy water they stayed on. Haven't had one break. They fit perfect.
4.0,"Great dress, nice thickness in material.  I did have to return one of them that I ordered in an 8-9.  Too big for my 7-year-old.  I wanted to order a 7, but since it is not sized that way, I ordered the 8-9 since she is a solid 7 usually.  Way too big.  Returned for the 6-7 and it is perfect!"
4.0,"So I’ve never used face jewels before; I always assumed they were complicated and sticky. But when I tried these ones, I was surprised at how comfortable they were! They didn’t pull on my skin and they felt secure even though I adjusted them multiple times! The headband was also comfortable and didn’t dig into my scalp or feel loose. The only issue I had was the horns were a little long, it started to look unusual to me HAHA But of course I’m sure you can always trim or adjust it somehow. This is a cute inexpensive costume and I’d recommend it if it’s what you’re going for!"
4.0,"The quality of the strap is good. It is thicker and slightly more rigid than the stock Timex NATO strap, making it easier to handle especially on the go.<br /><br />The only gripe is that the buckle pin is overly rigid due to the tight clearance cutting around it. Can be cut a little bigger so the pin moves easier."
4.0,Great little comfortable  inexpensive dress. My only complaint is the color is off. Picture shows the dress mostly green/blue but the dress is mostly red/yellow/orange. But I like the dress so much I ordered it in solid black.
4.0,"I ordered this for a wedding but didn’t even try it on because of the material. It’s cotton and the blue I ordered, reminded me of the scrubs I used to wear at work. Definitely not dressy enough for a wedding. Any other less formal occasion, yes."
4.0,A bit shorter then I expected. Still really love the shirt. Bought the green and black. Green color is lovely. Cute shirt overall.
4.0,"So for the most part i do like the fit. Im normally a large in shirts or xl if i want something a bit longer or more loose. I got a large and its a good fit and i like the length where its at, but it only goes partially down my lats which makes it feel and look a bit wierd from the back. So if i wanted my lats more exposed i would need to go larger but i dont want it much longer. Theres also a slight quality control issue on the stitching of one of my tanks at the shoulder seam. I may get an xl to see how differently it fits around the lats"
4.0,I like these briefs but the sizing is inconsistent.  I previously bought a Large and after losing some weight downsized to a Medium.  The Medium is the same size as the Large.
4.0,"It is certainly quite short so I ended up wearing tights which kinda altered the look I was going for.  And it did snag on itself.  But for the price and for the event I used it for, it was great."
4.0,its a little short. i'm 5'8 and it comes to the middle of my thigh. also the arms is a little tight but not to much. if they had a larger size i would've purchased..im 195 - 200 pounds size 38dd and 29 inch waist. hope this helps.
4.0,"These are really awesome looking shorts. The colors are vibrant red and gold and really pop.<br /><br />They run a bit small though. I am about a size 31 in store bought pants. So I went with size 32 in the shorts and they are a snug fit. These shorts are also SHORT. They will show a lot of thigh, which is fine with me. But if you're looking for a more relaxed or normal fit, go a size bigger than you would normally.<br /><br />I'd give these shorts 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the red ink runs. Beware! Wash them or soak them separately before putting them in the laundry with anything else, especially any white clothes. Washing them on their own caused the white lettering on the crotch area to turn pinkish, so they will never look as great as they did when new."
4.0,these are sweet eternity bracelets...only problem was it took  a month or more to receive....
4.0,"This shirt is really good quality.  The color is vibrant, the graphic is clear, and it is really cozy.  I was expecting it to be a little roomier.  It does run a little small, it fits well now, but I'm afraid that it will shrink when I wash it."
4.0,"I purchased this keychain about 8 months ago. The quality of this product is good, it has a nice weight to it (not cheap) and I enjoy the functionality of the keyring and lobster clasp, which is large enough to fit on most purse brackets, etc.<br />I was expecting a ball/sphere shape, however it is more like a slightly puffy disc (for lack of a better description). It measures 1 1/2 inches wide and about a 1/2 inch thick. I think if the photos showed a side view, my expectations would have been different.<br />The one downside is the gold finish - it has scratched/worn off almost completely, revealing the copper alloy (?) - I don't mind that too much but I would expect that more from a product in the $2-$5 range."
4.0,"This is an awesome set of tanks. Th moisture wicking works great. Used ir working in the yard in the heat and stayed cool. These would be a 5, but they fit about a size small and are snug. I did order a larger size so they will be looser for the gym."
4.0,"good find for the price. material is okay, it is tough to iron.  worth the buy"
4.0,The shirt looks absolutely great and the fabric is comfortable and not too thin.  The shirt fits about a half-size or so smaller than one might expect but it stil worked out fine.  A nice value for the price.
4.0,I absolutely love this case but I don't like the fact that the sunglasses don't stay in the slots when you close the case.
4.0,"I bought these glasses for my husband who is a pilot.  He cannot wear them when he works, as they are polarized lenses.<br />They are a nice weighted pair of sunglasses and fit nicely.<br />My husband loves these glasses and wears them often.  His only complaint (thus not the full 5 stars) is that, when he puts them on top of his head, they fall off when he bends over (we have young children)."
4.0,son uses these in college to take shower in.  he says they are comfortable and do what they are suppose to
4.0,"Based on the measurements I ordered a size small, but would have been better off with an extra small. I ended up hemming the length to fit above the knee and taking in the bust and waist.<br /><br />Super fun dress though and I received many compliments from it."
4.0,"this dress is darling! i'd wear it all the time,  if i didn't fear people noticing i was wearing the same damn dress EVERYDAY.<br /><br />very comfortable and oh so cute -"
4.0,Love it.. size and weight are great.
4.0,I absolutely love these yoga pants! They do run a little bit smaller than expected.
4.0,Amazing when I got this I was amazed it was better than ever expected and the price was also awesome
4.0,Beautiful beach cover up. Being petite the cover up is very large on me.
4.0,Colors are bright and looked great in kids pj pants.
4.0,Nice fashion earrings. They're really pretty... even prettier in person.
4.0,"This skirt was JUST as described,  and the tulle was really full. Unfortunately,  I ripped the satin lining when I sat down in the car, but because the tulle was ao full, you couldn't even see my ripped lining, lol.  Great buy since I didn't geel like making one. Worked out great for a photo shoot and my surprise 40th birthday party!"
4.0,The fit feels tailored .<br />It is very good for hot humid climate .<br />The buttons could be more robust . For the money its wears presentable .
4.0,Cute band to dress up my watch.  I like it.
4.0,"I bought an extra large and it fit like a medium, especially after washing. I’m 5’5” 150. So it does run small. But it’s really good quality and I really liked it so I kept it. Probably would not buy again but only because of the sizing because it’s not thin, it’s good quality."
4.0,"I like to shop with these bags, they are very sturdy and have handles fopr easy to carry items."
4.0,"Cute dress/tunic. I was somewhat disappointed with the color, it seemed like it was a little faded. Was expecting the colors to be a little more vibrant. But other than that, it looks very much like the picture."
4.0,"So this totally fits me in the thighs and butt (I'm a size 12), but the chest area is totally way too big (I'm a 36C). Not so big that it looks bad, but definitely for someone with a large cup size. The scalloping on the back is more spaced out and large, so it doesn't really show it's shape when I wear it."
4.0,"I really like this purse. The strap does not come attached, but I sewed it on and it is quite nice. The stitching is a little off in places, but I have to stare it down to find them. It is small and compact."
4.0,Bought the Santa and Snowmen masks for Christmas holiday. They were cute and earloops were not too tight for the men.
4.0,Very true to the picture. I hope they expand with wear cause the biggest size is only with good will a size 9
4.0,Beautiful bracelet but has the same problem most of the cheaper versions have - lock is not very secure. I hope I don't lose this one the way I have previous 'cheaper' versions. The real Swarowski has really secure lock...
4.0,"Love the look of these but my daughter at 12mo was only able to wear these for 1month before we decided the PJs are too small. And I ordered a size up. The top barely covers her tummy and the pants are like capris. Granted, my daughter is super tall but barely 23lbs at 14mo. Wish I ordered the 2t."
4.0,"Good strong belt. I got it for the buckle mostly. Wore it everyday for a while, now it is used on my battle belt for competitions. Carries 20lbs of gear no problem.<br />Only has 5 molle slots on one side near the buckle."
4.0,These compression pants provide sufficient compression for what they’re rated at. If you’re looking for extreme compression then they’re probably not the right pants for you but if you’re looking for mild to medium  compression. Then they’re really good option. And this pair really is a legging not tights
4.0,"Muy elegante, el tamaño es perfecto, pero se me dificulta un poco sacar las tarjetas, no se si porque tengo el máximo sugerido de 15 unid. pero hasta ahora resulta excelente!"
4.0,The posts are a little thick
4.0,"I received the Mercury color.  Took longer than you would expect but ok.  The color in photo gave me an impression of silver glitter and black.  Actually the glittery effect is a rainbow effect of colors in the light that is very slight.  What I wanted was more black/silver bling and this is not.  Have not used yet but seems well made and since it is made in USA - brooklyn,  I will keep them."
4.0,It’s pretty but runs small.
4.0,"It is really nice and sexy. The only thing is is that sometime is rids up in the back. Overall, it is great quality for the price."
4.0,works good even on fashion jewelry not only silver and gold &#62;&#62;&#62;your hands will be black if you don't wear gloves
4.0,"Really like the product. Very spacious for a weekend trip, and the material feels pretty durable. I removed one star because the shoulder strap doesn't have a cushion and it's pretty uncomfortable once the bag is full and heavy. Definitely wouldn't recommend this to be used if you are needing to carry this bag a lot. Otherwise, happy with my purchase."
4.0,"These are very helpful for organizing clothes.  I should have bought some sooner!  We travel a lot and it helps to keep my & my husband's clothes separated.  Also you can organize clothes by category, like one for undergarments, one for tops, etc."
4.0,The necklace has a cute design. It is light weight. It doesn't even feel like your wearing it or itches your neck. The only problem with the necklace is the clamp to the necklace is small to grip.. I gave it to my college age daughter .She loved it as a gift.
4.0,"i like the shirt but i was WAYYYY small and i still ordered too big. BUT i know the sizing is different, just cant wear it just yet"
4.0,This boot is very light and comfortable.
4.0,But I seen in the other reviews that it ran small so I  ordered a size up so it fits great!
4.0,It's a bit large but that makes it comfortable. Still a good purchase.
4.0,Strap won't stay tight but otherwise good bag
4.0,Not bad. Served its purpose. Especially for the price.
4.0,Super cute hats!! I would like to point out though please follow the don't put in washing machine. I was washing everything and I had pregnancy brain and didn't see anything that said don't machine wash. So I put them to wash and they came out like tube socks so lucky I figure out how to put them back together and then I put some tact stitches to make sure I didn't make the mistake twice.
4.0,"This dress is so beautiful and sexy! I was very nervous, especially when it comes to clothes on Amazon. I'm 5'4, 140lbs and ordered a medium. It fits perfectly! I'm ecstatic! Now I will probably order more colors. One thing... the material is thin so if you have a muffin top or belly fat it will probably show. I have some... so I sucked in lol. Still worth it though!"
4.0,"I do Barbarian Cosplay, and  I usually wear a leather breastplate that's pretty heavy.  Recently I attended the Renaissance Festival, and I was miserable in full armor under the stifling heat.  So when I got home I started looking for a lighter and more comfortable alternative.  Specifically, I was looking to a shirt that's similar to the one Arnold wore in &#34;Conan the Barbarian&#34;, when I stumbled upon this.  And while this shirt is not exactly like the one seen in the film, it's pretty darned close.  I'm a pretty muscular guy, and I typically wear a medium.  Most of the other readers have complained that the shirt is too small, and recommended going two sizes above normal.  I thought an extra large would be too big, so I took a chance and went with a large.  It fits perfectly.  I'm very happy with the purchase.  Not only do I have a more comfortable alternative to full on leather armor, but it looks great when worn underneath the breastplate, and if I get too uncomfortable, I can simply take the armor off while still going full barbarian.  And for the price, it can't be beat.  It's made of quality material and looks authentic rather than like a cheap piece of Halloween crap."
4.0,This top is true to size. . I purchased up a size and have worn them anyway. . the fall and winter will see long sleeve tissue tee's underneath.<br />I am 5'9&#34; and the top grazes the bottom of my behind.  there is a very nice swing to the hem and the fabric drapes well.
4.0,"I was very happy with this product overall. I have always worn just a simple brown leather belt for as long as I can remember and this was my first black belt. It is made of genuine black leather that is super soft and very durable, very impressed with the quality of leather and metals used. Ratchet design system is amazing and every belt I own I would like to have this system now, I felt spoiled with this belt. I may even wear this belt next month on my wedding day, that’s how nice it is. The belt is a bit thicker than regular belts which I like as I hate the thinner belts that are more in style now, they don’t work well wth keeping my pants up and secure with my body type. With the ratchet design it makes it so that it fits your exactly how you’d like it too whether you’re wearing lower or higher waisted pants, have your shirt tucked in or multiple layers tucked in, are bloated or have gained or lost weight. It fits perfectly and better than traditional belt loop designed belts as you can reduce or enlarge size in smaller increments giving a more easy and comfortable feel. I do wish there were actual written and photo instructions that came with the product as I feel if I didn’t pay enough attention I would have cut the wrong side of the belt when cutting down to fit my waist size. Had to go to Amazon product page to look up the written instructions, which still don’t tell you what end to cut.<br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
4.0,I got the Nigeria chain. I really like it because I have been looking for something like it but the hook was broken and would not close when I opened in so I had to return it. It came in a nice little black pouch which was nice.
4.0,"Love this jacket.  It is light weight but warm and soft.  Sporty looking but also classy .  BUT the bottom edge is not hemmed or finished in any way.  It is a raw edge and the edge curls and rolls up destroying the point edge look.  Even ironing the edge won't make it not roll up, but who wants to iron anyway.  So far it hasn't raveled with strings and I have washed it once, but I think it will eventually ravel.  They could have at least zig-zagged the bottom edge hem line.  For that reason I could only give 4 stars.  If it was hemmed, most definitely 5 stars."
4.0,"Fun shoes for kids, my daughter loves them running around in the dark outside. Shoe came were a little bigger the the the size, but that's okay she would grow into them."
4.0,"These are mirrored not pink lenses.  They are good sunglasses, just not exactly as picture appeared to me."
4.0,This is HUGE on my 8yo daughter. I wound up having to pin it to keep it from falling down. Still gets 4 stars because the price is so good.
4.0,"So far, so good. It’s not time to kayak with these yet, but I’m hoping for the best."
4.0,"I love the fit and feel of these! They’re amazing joggers for working out or lounging. My only complaint is that they started to pill the second time I wore them and now they are pilling all down the sides of both legs. Maybe that one pair was faulty, but the fabric didn’t last as long as I had hoped. Really cute tho and great for the price!"
4.0,"Super cute and a good deal for the price. Not the best quality, but they do the job. One of the appliqués was attached to the inside and not the outside of one of the headbands, which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars."
4.0,Light and cute!  Only thing I would say is it could be a tad bit longer and the neck hole a little more give.
4.0,"I bought this hood to wear under my full face helmet. It is a great insulator, and it helps block the wind that comes up through the bottom of the helmet. The only thing that I don't like it is that I can't wear it up on my nose. I wear glasses and every breath taken is sent straight up fogging up my glasses. You can wear the face portion of the hood under your nose and it works just fine."
4.0,little thin on material
4.0,Great stufff.
4.0,Super cute! But a tad bulky.
4.0,These shorts are amazing and fits great for working out and the ladies love it. They are so comfy my gosh.
4.0,the jacket is nice just a bit smaller than a medium
4.0,So beautiful I love it perfect fit
4.0,"Me gusta que no se marca en los pantalones, pero no comprimen el abdomen."
4.0,"Very cute dress, does not feel cheap. It's like a soft chiffon material. I'm normally between a Small/Medium but I went for the small because I wanted it shorter (as shown on the model) for a girls night out & it still was much longer on me. I'm 5'3.5"" 130 lbs and it was a a tiny bit above my knee in the front & longer in the back. Wish it was a little shorter. Happy I didn't go with the Medium though because it would've been below the knee. I was nervous the dress would be a bit tight on my chest because I'm a 34DDD (which is why I sometimes go for medium) but the small had more than enough room. Very comfy. I recommend."
4.0,They are a little bit different. The flower petals are smaller.
4.0,Received many compliments on this dress. Very stylish and comfortable.
4.0,Very nice watch.  Kept good time for the short time I had it.  Wrist band clasp always unlocked.  Lost two week after I received it.
4.0,"Great shorts, best I have ever owned.  I wish they had a back pocket. Price is too high but I don't think you will find a better quality pair of shorts."
4.0,This is great for necklaces and the neutral color will match any bedroom.
4.0,"its pretty, looks like it is made well"
4.0,"These were really pretty and great quality for the price. A little large for me personally, but still nice!"
4.0,I am a petite person so I will have to shorten it concretely.
4.0,The Apple design comes in handy to store my iPad. I have multiple devices that I move around. It's a help to find the cases that indicate which is which. I have noticed that with more recent purchases of this material that there is more smell and they are thicker and just not as pleasing as earlier purchases.
4.0,A little bit long but works. Just wish it was a little bit shorter.
4.0,"This costume was an absolute hit! I pulled off a really great Saitama cosplay for a Halloween party.<br /><br />Although I did have to have my friend who is a seamstress reinforce the stitching in both wrists, as they split relatively quickly after wearing the costume. Be careful when sliding in and out of this."
4.0,"It is risky buying clothes without seeking them first. This belt is quality throughout. The best file is heavy and has a nice finish. The belt itself is thick leather, glossy finish. Nothing artificial. I am going to order another."
4.0,I get compliments all day when I wear this shirt!
4.0,Great belt just a little thinner than I thought.
4.0,"I ordered a couple sizes up after reading reviews, so I got one that fits me.  length is a little longer than I expected, below my knees, but that could partially be to ordering larger size?  material is pretty thick, should hold up well and drapes nicely."
4.0,I love the dress. The opening at the front of the dress does not close properly and I have to use a decorative pin or a safety pin(hidden to make it look ok.
4.0,"Really cute, fit a little loose. Liked the adjustable straps."
4.0,"I really like the material and the style, my only problem is that with some brand I use Large and with other X-Large, I just wanted to be safe and bought the X-Large and it was just a bit large so I might get the Large one later. My basis for the size was mainly the chest and it fit well on my chest but the shoulder size (from shoulder to shoulder) was a little bit larger than expected."
4.0,"These are very pretty earrings. They are however, very light and the clasps were a little hard to open and close. I'm hoping that after time they will loosen up a little bit.  Definitely not going to lose these hoops!  The rhodium plating does make them very shiny and noticeable. Also nice because they are tri-color and very versatile with different colors of gold. Reasonably price aslo!"
4.0,"This ring feels sturdy and is pretty cute.  It's a bit &#34;blingy&#34; for my tastes, but my son loves seeing it on me.  It is stamped inside, however it's not clear what it says.<br /><br />I think this would be a nice gift idea for someone who likes foxes and blingy jewellery.  I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,The fit is great. They are cushioned but solidly support your feet. They look nice and the price is excellent.
4.0,Last par of chinese shoes ripped within 6 months. Lets see how these go
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:6d307bd30766b31e4f58d141198f7b7f]] Very good material and very cute, just keep in mind that my stepdaughter is a size 2 and these were too small so maybe go a size up."
4.0,"Just as pictured. Short skirt, just as I imagined.  My toddler is slim and it fit her snug so it is not meant for thicker in the middle kiddos. If I one area of improvement would be the quality of hhe material but it i okay."
4.0,They're alright I suppose. I don't expect them to last too long as the ends of the gaiter aren't sewn over to prevent fraying in the wash. They will absolutely get me by for now and they are good for the price. The patterns are fun.
4.0,"Although it's a roomy and beautiful purse, it has no zippered pockets inside, nor does it have any card holders or anything like that.  I don't consider it to be a true organizer purse. Now I'm stuck with a purse with a lot of big, empty, featureless pockets."
4.0,"Neleus shorts: Well made and have good compression. They might feel a little small,  but they are supposed to add some compression, which is what they do. Good design.  Fabric wicks well and dries quickly."
4.0,This is a cute hat and it fits my 2.5 year old well.
4.0,"I would expect it to fully overlap, however from crotch down it does not. I am a true 2x , and this claims to be a 2x-3x. Well forget 3x for sure. My waist is actually a 1x, but I like looser shirts so I get 2x. I don't like shirts that hug my body."
4.0,"For price, good however, material fades fast"
4.0,Quality is commensurate with the price.  Overall satisfied with this purchase.
4.0,"These are very cute, but after one wear the sole at the toe started the come apart. We got them for a wedding."
4.0,My daughter  looks very cute with this. Two piece bikini... she loves it!
4.0,Does what they are supposed to do. Works well and are comfortable.
4.0,Look great and shipped faster then I thought they would. Looks great with my suits and I've found it to be a good conversation starter. Made of metal and design looks as is in pictures. Overall Im happy with my purchase.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate
4.0,It's what I expected.  Like wearing it.
4.0,"the one-sided design noted in other comments doesn't bother me.  I have long hair and the back side rarely shows. Also, the imprint is really pretty. More than worth the price."
4.0,It took a lot of rubbing but got it clean enough. I was expecting a bit more.
4.0,"Very nice quality, but it runs big. I got a small, I’m 5’0, 125lbs and a 32DD and still it was not fitted."
4.0,Lo vamos a devolver. Muy estrechos.
4.0,They look good and are comfortable.
4.0,I love these chokers. The give me a playful kinds BDSM look to my everyday outfits. The vlack and pink are still in perfect condition but my purple one is come up a bit on the strap. they are still very cute and I get loads on compliments on them.
4.0,"Nice pleats. A little tight in the waist. Material was somewhat thin. No pockets. This skirt works well for sports or things, not as great for everyday use."
4.0,"I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. Very see through and needs a slip. I ordered the xl based on the waist sizing but probably could have done the large. I'm 5'6"" and a 12-14 dress size."
4.0,"It's cute but a little different from the picture. Mine didn't have a little pawprint and the chain is different. He also had a little smudge on him but I don't mind since I'm sure he'll get dirty anyway on my keys. My only worry is the loop the chain is attached to is pretty thin and I'm worried about it breaking. Other than that, it's cute."
4.0,it is a beautiful watch but the band looks cheap other than that fir the price you can go wrong ... I just change the band for my husband and he is in love with it 💙
4.0,"These are a nice durable and stylish pair of glasses.  The frames are large, in the retro standard wayfarer style but hard enough not to break and flexible to fit around different faces.  The lenses are mirrored, with several choices of colors and while dark, work well  in the sunlight.  I would not recommend them if you plan to wear them in darker areas.  Overall, a good deal, especially for people like me who lose or break them' a lot.<br /><br />I received these at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  This review contains my honest opinion after wearing these glasses and is not influenced by the discount."
4.0,"I'm not a 4 eyes but my girlfriend is, and she said she wanted a PRADAAAAAAA one because that's what all the cool girls had. Now, I tried explaining to her she's a 4 eyes so being cool is not going to happen no matter what she carried her extra pair of eyes in, but after she begged me and made me a sand-which, I caved in and bought it for her. 4 stars for 4 eyes."
4.0,"Beautiful dress. Felt lady like. My husband loved it. Would have kept the dress and  given 5 stars, but, it was a little too short above my ankle, and I wanted a longer type dress."
4.0,This was pretty good. Fits well in C cup. My only reservation is that it kept sliding down in some areas throughout the day. There is no rubber on the inside to prevent slipping.wore it with a thin top and the lace wasn’t bulky and didn’t show through
4.0,"I love this band. Beautiful color and it’s styling! Only downfall is I have small wrist and even the smallest size was rather big, the band shows on the other side when I wear it."
4.0,The kid still loved it<br />“
4.0,Run small. Had to return because of fit. Nice shorts if not for running small compared to standard sizing.
4.0,I really liked the style but they do slide down my nose easily.
4.0,"Ran a whole size too small, but l like the lightweight material as we live in the south where it seldom gets COLD."
4.0,I really like it.  I have not worn it yet. I am looking for the perfect top.
4.0,Nicely made except for the clasp. You have to play eith it to get it to snap in place.
4.0,"The shoes is fine and fit my daughter but the problem we having right now is that when charging the shoes, light are flashing to let you know that<br />it's been charging on one shoe only ...To me , it looks like the other does have a problem...So we are unable to charge both of them ...<br />But when charging the one for my other two children you can see the light flashing on both the pairs...<br />let me know what to do with...<br />thank you..."
4.0,"Nice look,  is not slim fit,  but it is warm  and good looking"
4.0,She said it is soft and comfortable.
4.0,"I love the design on this luggage tag. The strap that attaches to the tag seems a little flimsy, but as of one flight, it is still attached!"
4.0,"Cute, flowy and lightweight blouse. Love the “red”, which is actually more of an orange red. I’m usually a size 14 and buy L-XL tops to make sure they fit the 36DDDs and aren’t snug at the hips. Cleavage looks awesome in this blouse. 😉<br /><br />As one of the negative reviews pointed out, yes when tied, the underside white side of<br />blouse shows. This doesn't bother me. As shown in the pic, it will show skin if you lift your arms or thru the tie if tied loosely. I just wear a tank underneath if wearing to work or if the jeans I’m wearing are low on the hips.<br /><br />Ordering another color!"
4.0,A bit tight in the chest and I ordered a large
4.0,The cherries were good size but a little heavy. But just what we thought they should be.
4.0,Great boot for the Price! Half size up is true to size. I wear a 10 and purchased the 10 1/2. Fits well!
4.0,Like the versatility of multiple lenses.  The only drawback is that the lenses are small.  Feel like this is a great fit for my grandchildren and not Paw Paw.
4.0,"I followed the size chart and reviews and order a 2XX (I typically wear a large and have square shoulders. I LOVE the fabric and color, however the size was just way too large. I am returning them and possibly ordering replacements. I need them for an event THIS weekend. They seem to have nice quality and construction, the material is nice too. I imagine they will be perfect for summer with a pencil skirt or skinny jeans and heels. I do worry about the length on a smaller size. I ordered Black, Pink and Teal.<br /><br />Sadly I did not receive this product at a discount for my honest review."
4.0,Great costume! Just a little disappointed that the bow isn't anywhere near as big as the picture. Can't wait to wear it next weekend ;)
4.0,really cute. they are as described not as pictured which is what i wanted. the frame is clear yellow.
4.0,These are all very fun and comfortable earrings to wear. They are a little difficult to get threaded sometimes because the ball is so small; but they stay threaded and dont fall off. I wear mine all the time.
4.0,"A bit large, mostly due to the stiff toe allowing your feet to really move around at the tip."
4.0,Good fabric. Little too long . Looks good
4.0,"I looked at WalMart & Target for these, which I remember my mother using on me when I was a baby. No one carries them anymore, it seems. They are perfect for those first few months when the baby is harder to dress.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is that they are MADE IN CHINA.  I wish the manufacturer would have them made here in the United States."
4.0,Good for my work
4.0,What you would expect for the price. Love all the slots for cards however not all the pockets are credit card size or even business card size. Some are smaller and useless.
4.0,Nice fit and comfortable! Just had my second baby 3 months ago so I needed some new jeans that actually fit but weren't maternity! I like the stretch and the color of the wash. Might have to order in another wash as well:) These fit pretty true to size.
4.0,The pajamas are really cute and the material is pretty soft for the price obviously. But I would suggest ordering a size up for sure I’m 5’9 150lbs  and I got a large and the shorts are extremely short
4.0,I was trying to find soft but durable house slippers. These fit nicely and feel nice.
4.0,"These are mostly for fun but even at that there are some drawbacks. The design and color are both nice-looking and the chunky nature of the glasses makes them less liable to crack or break. However, the arms are very thick which greatly limits peripheral vision and there is a ""boxing"" effect of the lenses which reduces the field of vision. In other words, these are NOT driving sunglasses. Even though the lenses really reduce glare and I'd like to wear them more, they are really for hanging out on the beach or other non-lethal past times."
4.0,"Loses fibers like crazy and you have to watch the curls so they don't snag or tangle. Otherwise, comfortable to wear and thick. Very fun! Bought for my Snorlax cosplay."
4.0,"I bought this robe for my sister after she suffered a broken hip and wrist after a fall in her home. I wanted something pretty to lift her spirits while she was confined temporarily to a Rehabilitation Center and lightweight for her daily rehabilitation walks. She loved it, everyone did. It's really pretty and lightweight and it's perfect for the upcoming Las Vegas hot summer weather! I'm going to purchase the white one for myself."
4.0,They looks so nice but too mature for my age
4.0,"My two nieces saw mine and loved it, so I ordered both of them one"
4.0,"Sleeves very long but the rest of the fit as usual.  very soft, light fabric, warm but not toasty.  Nice and long also."
4.0,"...except for the madness in the delivery end, I am enjoying the feel of this wallet.  It is compact and easy to manipulate in and out of my pocket."
4.0,"Very nice, came in a small plastic pouch, would be nice if they came in a necklace box!"
4.0,i love the material and they are nicely made. ran abit small but i ordered a size up so it worked out ok
4.0,"THE LOVELY BOX HOLDS A BEAUTIFUL CHARM BRACELET THAT LOOKS VERY RICH AND STUNNING.  THIS WAS A GIFT PURCHASE AND THE RECIPIENT SHOULD ADORE IT.  HOPEFULLY IT WILL WEAR WELL,"
4.0,They are good...my daughter can put them on by herself. Just that her hair get stuck in them and she can't take them off. She is 7 and need these for her gymnastics class.
4.0,At the time I was under the impression the this hat had a Velcro strap in the back but it had a clip that's ok but in time the metal clip will corrode to some extent. Other that that I am very satisfied.
4.0,This dress was too big coming off the shoulders and the waist was not as fit as I wanted it to be and I didn’t like the cotton material!
4.0,These were perfect for my sisters 60th birthday flamingale Party. We used them for party favors for each of the ladies. Super fun.
4.0,"I ordered this bag and absolutely loved it but they shipped it with gold hardware and I didn't want gold hardware, as a matter of fact the picture showed silver hardware and I assumed that was what I would get because there was certainly no place to specify on the order what color hardware you wanted.  It just made me sick because it was exactly what I was wanting.  I had to return it."
4.0,Nicely made top. Sizing is off. Will give away
4.0,"Fit well on my bracelet, do a great job of spacing. However, they are a bit dirty. Be careful where you set them!"
4.0,"Comfortable, easy to use, and don't look bad with jeans. I think they are well worth the money if they hold up and every indication is they are well made and should last for a while."
4.0,I like to take these to yard sales to check small print on jewlery ect.Good to see any small print even pill bottles. Ikeep one in my purse at all times for that reason. Worth having.
4.0,"These are super soft. They are not high waisted and although listed as “tummy control” I don’t think there’s any compression.  Great for walks, but would need another layer when the weather turns cold."
4.0,"Comfortable and warm, hoping they'll last a long time."
4.0,"I wore this to cover up for my 5k run in the fall in 30 degrees. I had a silky long sleeve, a flannel and this light weight jacket. I was starting to sweat from the running. Glad the jacket is a little big on me also. I like it a lot."
4.0,Just beautiful the print. Not true to size on top.
4.0,e did not like color
4.0,Quality construction. A bit difficult to st adjust around suitcase.
4.0,"Real cute,  lots of compliments. The faces large and I like it that way, the dots could be confusing if you're looking for them to be on a number. Would buy again."
4.0,The item is just as described. I love the length and bronze color! I may order more for friends. :)
4.0,"This is a great shirt, but does run slightly small. I bought a Guess shirt almost exactly like it for 4 times the price. This shirt was as nice as the Guess but a bit smaller for the same size."
4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my bf. Definitely a conversation piece that makes people happy to see. The material is nylon or similar, so not great in a humid environment, so one star taken off. Otherwise, a fun gift!"
4.0,"This was a gift for my 17 year old daughter, She loved it, I love it. Only negative is that its a tad large without a hairband on it,  so it will slip off a little too easy if not paying attention. But a quality product for the money. Will be buying more for Christmas gifts."
4.0,"EXCELLENT SUNGLASSES. LENS ARE PERFECT SHADE FOR DRIVING AS WELL AS OTHER NON-SPORTS FUNCTIONS.  GLASS LENSES ARE SOMEWHAT HEAVY.  OTHERWISE, PERFECT."
4.0,"Very colorful. Great size. Especially for making bracelets, and necklaces."
4.0,All it needs is a little ironing and you’re good!
4.0,"it fits well, substantial fabric, and nice detailing"
4.0,I didn't like the way the extra band slides under the staps instead of how the fit bit one locks on.
4.0,"I’m not sure how well I like this dress, the fabric feels nice, It fits good and has a nice drape. I am 6'2"" and it rests slightly above my ankles. The print is a bit too busy. Overall this is a nice dress  and is good quality."
4.0,"This necklace is gorgeous. I am a big fan of tree anything especially ones that look like this and the gemstones just add that extra touch to make the necklace stand out. I get tons of compliments when I wear this necklace and it is such a statement piece to dress up any outfit. It is the perfect length where I can just slip it on and off and it is very durable and well made which is great since I have a 2 year old. I have had no problems with this necklace so far.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving this necklace 5 stars is because the gemstones are not as vibrant in person as they appear in the picture which was kind of a letdown but otherwise, beautiful and I love this necklace very much.<br />*I was sent this product at a discount to review for my honest opinion. All opinions are my own."
4.0,Been looking for a ring for index finger and this fit the bill.  Very pretty but would be hard to adjust to much smaller.  I got it to fit size 8.  It says there is a marking to indicate that it is silver but I don't see that inside the ring so not 100% sure it is as indicated.  But it is pretty and have gotten complements from friends
4.0,Fits perfect. Very comfortable.
4.0,The style and look is amazing. It is very spacious inside. The only issue is that the wheels get stuck and made it hard to push and pull at times.
4.0,"meh, rope was bit shorter then expected. Not my best Bolo..Not my worst either."
4.0,"Just received my sweats in Camo and Navy Blue. The material is soft however, if you are thick in the thighs, they are not a true XL. They give enough for me and I’m over 200 and under 245 lbs. FYI, am XL is for a size 16-18. Overall, I’m pleased. I’ll let you know how they hold up after washing them."
4.0,"A little big, I didn't account for a western buckle."
4.0,"This dress is so fun and retro. Love the popping color. Would give a 5 star if the material wasn't bathing suit like. For perspective, I'm 5 2 1/2 and 118. I got the small."
4.0,Very cute shoes! Unfortunately they sent me the wrong size:( luckily though they fit my younger daughter! The strap is a bit tight for her chubby baby feet though.
4.0,"Not purchased here but I am chiming in to agree with other buyers....it's very long on my 5'nothing frame. The straps shorten only so far. That said, a couple adjustments at the sewing machine...hemmed up several inches and shortened straps and it looks super cute and breezy and easy to wear. I will pause before wearing it in bright daylight though! Over a bathing suit for sure!"
4.0,eBoots or the best love the way it lets me still use shirts.
4.0,Everything is good. Big enough to cover the whole glasses. The only problem is the dust may go into the case after putting it in a car for a while.
4.0,Looks really good with 4 or 5 of my colored dress shirts. Got what I asked for.
4.0,They are quite warm!!!  They are colorful and fun!
4.0,I bought this sweater for me and I love it..
4.0,Was a gift for my son he loved it.
4.0,"5' 7&#34; and 178lb. I got the US Medium equivalent. It's definitely a snug fit, so if you are comfortable with that, it is a great jacket. It's great for relatively mild, cool weather. Due to its fit and material, would not suggest it as a substitute for a durable heavy jacket for your colder weather needs. If I had to re-purchase, I would probably get a size larger just for a little more breathing room when/if I need to wear an extra layer or two underneath."
4.0,Cute! Gift to daughter-in-law.
4.0,"Fleece overheats me. This fleece is a polyester and spandex material and I just find that it traps heat. Great if you live where it snows. Not so great in Florida for me. For people who come from other states to live here, they will find it nice and warm. For those of us born and raised in Florida, we seldom wear a sweater. And I personally find fleece stifling."
4.0,"I’m 5’8, 130 lbs. Ordered a small. Material was soft. Dress was comfortable and hit right at my knees. However, I have a 27 inch waist and more athletic build legs. The dress was a little baggy on my stomach and tight on my leg (bodycon style). You could easily have the dress tailored a few inches, I just didn’t feel like messing with it so I returned. If you have a slightly larger waist this dress should fit you perfect. Still gave four stars cause it was almost perfect."
4.0,"I would recommend this bracelet to someone who is large-boned or has thick wrists. It would look smashing on you!<br /><br />First off, the delivery was quick, thank you. The price is fair, thank you again. The quality is really very good, thanks a third time. However, when I wear this bracelet, it is more of an irritant and never really fades into the background of wearing it. I am always cognizant of it, because it is so thick and large on my wrist. I don't recall viewing any perspective photos on the item description page in Amazon, but it would have been really helpful (for me) to have it there. I think I would have recognized immediately, Oh, I should get something a little smaller/thinner/less obtrusive.<br /><br />That said, I recommend it, if the size/girth is what you are looking for. Highly recommended in color, quality, delivery, price."
4.0,No instructions easy install
4.0,"It's a little irritating on my skin, for which I'm deducting one star although that is probably the nature of the cloth. I wear a camisole underneath and it mitigates the itchiness for the most part. It's quite warm and comfortable, though, and I like the blue color (which is exactly as depicted)."
4.0,"I like this and wore it for Easter Sunday.  BUT!!  I had to return the first one I ordered and order a size larger.  I am 5'7"" and a true Medium.  The Medium that I ordered barely came below my knees and was say too tight across the bust.  I returned and ordered a Large, and was very pleased.  So, order up and enjoy!!!"
4.0,"When I look at this sweatshirt, I think baseball.  It has kind of a look of a baseball uniform.  It’s made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester.  The outside is a little more “rough” and the inside is soft and a bit “fuzzy”.  I have a size Large and it measures approximately 22.75” from the top of the shoulder to the bottom.  The arms measure 19.5” from where they attach at the shoulder to the end.  Note the cool logo on the upper left, and also at the end of the left sleeve.  Made in China, so I think it’s currently a bit pricey at almost seventeen bucks. . . but. . I like it."
4.0,"It arrived much more sooner than expected! Fits great and the leather has a nice texture, and est of all it looks fashionable."
4.0,"Ordered slightly bigger than my regular size, glad I did, because sizing up meant they fit perfectly. Nice stretchy material, looks great."
4.0,"Does not fit as pictured but very comfortable.  Arms were tight, yet dress fit was much looser and more bag-like than pictured.  Easily fixable if you can sew though.  Nude/cream colored dress is see through."
4.0,"The ties on the ear hold comes apart easily and doesn’t stay tied. Works better on smaller faces and if careful. They look great on and were perfectly fine for our night at a haunted park. Won’t use in daily life this Halloween season as hoped, due to the tying issue but they were worth the price for what we got."
4.0,"Fabric is very fake, if you want a cotton dress this isn't it. But it is astoundingly cute. I'm 5'0 so it hits around the knee on me, but works wonderfully with tights. I'm student teaching and paired with a scarf, its ideal for colder weather and parent teacher meetings. Cute, comfy, professional and pretty cheap."
4.0,Great shirt that fits my 2 yr old perfectly
4.0,The mask right out of box is okay at best. Put it on a foam head and leave it for a while to let it regain its shape from being stuffed in a bag for who knows how long. Use heat from a hair dryer if needed. I repainted mine and trimmed it up to fit my head better which really brought it to life. Great cheap option for someone who wants to customize their own mask
4.0,I gave them as a gift to a friend. She loves them and wears them all the time. No complaints!!
4.0,"This is a great bag.  Roomy, handy outside pockets ... love it."
4.0,"I do love it and the color, little short but can wear/"
4.0,"Was a little scared at first when I began to put them on...I figured there was no way they would squeeze over my calves, let alone reach up to my knees (I'm a 5'11 woman with a size 10 shoe and 15 inch calves and ordered a Medium). With a little bit of effort, the socks both squeezed over my calves and amazingly reached all the way up to my knees. Now, don't get me wrong, there was a fair bit of compression going on, but it was not in any way uncomfortable. My only complaint was that my legs got a little itchy, but I partially blame the fact that I had yet to shave them. I'm a nursing student and can't wait to see how my feet feel after 12 hour clinical days with these on!"
4.0,"I love the look of these earrings, but they are pretty heavy and will pull down on your lobes."
4.0,It’s huge but I love the quality of this robe.
4.0,Runs small! I ordered a medium and wear medium all the time. The fabric does not give around the arms and chest. I can’t return it and haven’t worn it. Either order up or don’t waist your money.
4.0,"The hat provides good coverage, but more floppy than I would like. I really don't have a need to fold it, since I use it when working in my garden or walking dogs on our property. I like that it has ties to keep it from blowing off in the wind. It is not as cool as the hat I am replacing likely due it being made of polyester in addition to paper. I wish I still had my other hat with leather ties, but I left it sitting where my dog could reach it, and he shredded it."
4.0,"For the price, this is an awesome item!"
4.0,"I love this swimsuit, it’s super chic and fits great however it arrived damaged, missing some of the design on the strap in a super noticeable spot. I returned this item and ordered a replacement but it makes me question how delicate the design on the straps might be and if they will come off and deteriorate quickly?"
4.0,They aren't bad for price
4.0,"This is a very pretty summer weight drssd. A faux wrap it features a modesty snap at the bodice and a tie belt. There are pickets. The rayon fabric is light, soft but thin. Wearing a slip is a good idea. The floral pattern is pretty. I like the vee neck. The drape is lovely and the front hem is higher than the bc ack. Nice dress for warm weather."
4.0,No need to size up in this jacket. Very cute!
4.0,"Very beautiful. The only thing is that I wish the bead part was longer. It is hard to tell while ordering what the length is for the beads in relation to the rest of it. So, though it fits my waist I don't have enough beads to go around, so I have been wearing it as an anklet (it looks great that way)."
4.0,"When ordering this dress, you should probably size up.  Had to return it."
4.0,Good size and lots of pockets! Hi
4.0,I rated this item with four stars due to it not being as long as i thought it would be. The kimono came just as it appears in the photo though and the material is a thin but nice material. Great product overall
4.0,Plan on buying again just a size bigger than normal to get that flowy look
4.0,"I like it a lot! It’s a nice length, stretchy, comfy, and very flattering. I got a medium, which the tag says is an 8/10. I’m kind of between a 6/8, so it isn’t baggy but isn’t tight either."
4.0,Fit well! Maybe a tiny smidge on the too big side but not enough to mark as such cuz I can’t remember if I ordered a size larger than usual.  Beautiful dress! Thin fabric makes it slightly see-through and style does not allow for full body slip. Must wear skin color undergarments.
4.0,Like this shirt
4.0,They were too big but it was the size my sister told me to get for my niece. My son has a pair and they fit perfect! They are perfect for water sports and the beach
4.0,My daughter loves these rain boots. She’s been wearing them since we got them. Super bummed that the small handles broke already.
4.0,"Good quality for the price. Just make sure you get a few sizes bigger than your actual size. I ordered a medium and it was way too small. Returned it and ordered an XXL and it fit just right. Other than that, good product. Decently fast shipping too."
4.0,Super cute sweater but the length in the sleeves are a little small. Overall great quality for the price.
4.0,"They are very comfortable. I can tell a big difference when I wear them, The glasses come in a nice wooden box with a cloth bag for protection and a cloth for cleaning them. A very nice touch! My main issue is that these are very high light blocking. Everything is very yellow rather than a yellow tint. It is most noticeable when writing a letter on the white background. However, my eyes quickly adjust to the tint. The glasses are a bit on the large size but that also blocks out any side glare if you use more than one monitor. They're really light weight and can feel a little flimsy which concerns me about durability, but so far no issues. However, dollar for dollar, I find them comparable with like priced yellow tinted computer glasses."
4.0,Super flirty. Very thin material though. I don't see it lasting long but it's very cute. Would buy other colors.
4.0,"These were more fitted than I was expecting, but I like them! A looser version of leggings. I’m 5’6 155lbs and got a large!"
4.0,"I don't know why everyone said the size runs small.  if  you follow the chart in the pictures, it fit exactly as it should.  It was very comfortable.  I did not wear the apron because it was shiny and looked cheap.  it also covered up the embroidery."
4.0,Water proof nylon
4.0,The whole under side has been burnished.... Which isn't a bad thing just real stiff and sharp to have on for a while Untill it breaks in.  Also it's a light tan color...i thought it would be darker.... But I'll just re dye it one I get leather die.... Not  a deal breaker...
4.0,Sparkly and perfect for me!
4.0,Cute little dress for summer
4.0,this is a cute dress but it is heavy fabric and is kinda some kind of stretch knit. not quite as the picture shows but still cute
4.0,Really does glow in the dark. Can't give 5 stars because chain already looks rusty
4.0,Way too big!! Even on tightest setting. Super XL
4.0,"It fit my nose very well, but after a few wears it started to wear down to steel. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars."
4.0,"I bought 4 pair of these underwear at the same time I bought a pair of Hanes underwear expecting the KEFITEVD brand to not hold up as well. I was pleasantly surprised to find that these underwear have not only proven to be well made, but they are very comfortable. They don't ride up through the day and fit just right. My only gripe is that they aren't as absorbent as I had hoped, but they do a decent job of wicking away most sweat. Would definitely buy again!"
4.0,This sweater fits nicely and looks great.  I like the price.
4.0,Soo soft love it!!!! Would definitely recommend
4.0,Good quality and matched the picture.
4.0,"The nose pad parts were loose, other than that I love this glasses-lets see how long they can hold up! #ILoveYou3000"
4.0,This is much smaller than expected. However very well made. The only thing is the yellow is very bright. If trying to match yellows be careful. Thankfully mine is going on a white garmet. I gave it 4 stars only because of the price to size ratio. I buy bigger patches for cheaper all the time. Of its what you're looking for though it's worth the money for the craftsmanship.
4.0,"These shades look great and offer good eye protection without being too dark. Lenses do pop out if you drop it a few times, but they just pop back in."
4.0,Like this little dress.
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:3bef95d3628412b77920c88684e60d58]] The dress itself and color is beautiful! Now, it was a little larger/longer than I had anticipated, but nonetheless, everyone in my family that has seen her try it on after it was delivered - love it! And they love that it sweeps the floor a bit like a true princess dress. My 21 month old is 24 Lbs and about 30 inches high and fits into 24 months - 2T toddler sizes.<br /><br />The appliqué and stitching are obviously not of the highest grade or quality, but the dress was poofy, we added a crinoline skirt underneath to stiffen the poofy effect as well. Anyway, we cannot wait for her to use this at the military princess ball she got invited to!"
4.0,"It was a gift, I like the material that its made from along with the elastic waistband but it seems to fit a little snug the size I've ordered. Overall price for the product is good"
4.0,This is a cute and comfortable dress sock. I like to wear these at work in the winter with my dress pants and boots or close toed shoes. they fit as expected and the design is cute.
4.0,"I loved this mask but my husband said it was too feminine for him to be seen in public in. It was for a work event for him, so we ordered a second option which you like better. This is a very beautiful mask but it's a little sparkly and could be a little feminine. I really liked it though. :-)"
4.0,"This was a comfy camisole top for my wife who simply needed more since she wore with jeans or shorts during those hot summer days. They look good, have a nice cut and stitch which seem durable. I would like said the cotton was soft and comfortable. The neckline was good in size (I got the Medium) also, the armholes were perfectly balanced not too narrow. I order the medium size but when I got the top it said large size. This top only fit women size 0 to 6. This is perfect for women who has the flat tummy ,...just little tighter for women who has tummy part.<br /><br />These tanks hold up very well and do not roll up after wearing for hours. I would say it perfect for warm weather. It lets my body stay cool. The colors are soft and the material is not really thin but not thick either. The built in bra fits perfectly women size 34-B or under.<br /><br />She washed top and the color did not fade away. No sinking... No thread coming out.... No bad news at all. Overall great quality for such a reasonable price. The price is little higher just to buy one camisole top. I received this product for free in exchange of my honest review."
4.0,It's possible I just have short legs but I thought these were thigh high and they go wayyyy up my leg.
4.0,"Love the dress, nice fit, elegant and light, but do not like the outer layer, the gray, it seems cheap"
4.0,It's my first time buying leg warmers. They  fit really well and are very comfortable.
4.0,The cases were exactly as expected for the price I paid. I would purchase them again for another child.
4.0,Cute for fun jewelry.  Pearls are a little too oversized for my taste but it's a fun bracelet all the same.
4.0,"Great quality and fast shipping. The fit is pretty good, the only this is around the shoulders. I bought a large and the sleeves around the upper arm and shoulders was a little tight. I have zero arm muscle so I’m not sure why it was that tight but it may be because of the lining. Great quality though!"
4.0,"Pretty. They aren't heavy, and are good for every day wear."
4.0,Very attractive shirt
4.0,It looks expensive and is well-made.
4.0,"This dress is very pretty. Quality fabric, not sheer at all. You will want a lint brush. It attracts. Don't size up if you are small busted. The armholes are generous. I am sz 4 5 ft 9 and 130lbs. This dress requires confidence. It is extremely body-con. The type of dress that makes any belly look like you are constipated. The knee are is a little constricting. You have to wiggle walk. I purchased in black, and wine, The wine does not retain the color very well. Still recommend. It's sexy, and the black can go day to evening easily."
4.0,Love this tie.  Received lots of compliments.
4.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; 125 lbs and I ordered a small. I usually wear a size 4 in AE jeans and a small on top. The bottom was a little tighter than I would like, but it still fits well. I would even order in other colors!"
4.0,Seems durable
4.0,"I really liked this dress and the quality of the material was better than expected, BUT if you are tall (I'm 5'9''), then it will not be a maxi dress on you. It comes to above my ankles and is a weird length on me so unfortunately i have to return it."
4.0,"Truly scary, worked well for halloween night. The eye, nose and mouth slits were very thin. I had to cut them a little wider to be able to wear it. Thats the only reason I give it 4 stars."
4.0,Cups too small
4.0,"I got a lot of good complements on dress. Fit good the only issue was the color. It wasnt a full white color, it was more like an off white cream color, but it still worked fine."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:872793d6f883025b43af05e6fb83a392]] This winter Pullover Sweater is oversized and I didn't expect it to be larger than my usual size<br />It's heavy weight and gives great warmth after my daughter tried it<br />Beautiful looking with the zip at the neck and pretty in color but one size larger than usual<br />Well knitted and nicely designed<br />You can wear it at all times<br />With its large size, it suits many tastes<br />I liked this sweater"
4.0,"the yellow skirt was a bit too sheer for my taste, so make I have to make sure to wear something under.<br /><br />the elastic that is on the waist is not well put and spins every time I take the skirt off.<br /><br />besides that the skirt is of good quality material ."
4.0,I always read reviews before purchasing. These reviews are inconsistent bc these tops are different materials and fit differently. I got the “brown pink” cami. It is lighter and has no give and fits smaller than the leopard. I also got the leopard Which is completely different material and fits differently. The lace on top is the same but everything else is different. Size up with brown pink. Leopard fits more true to size. They both look great but fit and feel differently!
4.0,"A good tool for travel, especially when a passport is needed.  Bought this one for a friend when we travelled together."
4.0,"Very pretty dress.  I was a little disappointed with the color.  The picture looks like a cranberry or wine color, but when I received the dress, it was bright red.  I like the style, so I kept it anyway.  The dress has a great fit for a curvy girl like myself."
4.0,beautiful color just small
4.0,It's fine. I expected a tiny bit more shine. But I'll keep it because once the charms are on you won't see the bracelet anyway.
4.0,"Pretty, flowy and light weight. The fabric is quite thin, which probably means having to wear a slip underneath. The size large fit my usual 12/14 with the length not to short for my 5'2&#34; height.  Love the 3/4 length sleeves."
4.0,"Like the look, but it runs too small."
4.0,it's very cute! I got a medium and I wear a medium so it was a good purchase!
4.0,"It's beautiful,  but I couldn't wear it.  Good news is my oldest daughter can so I gave it to her.  The dress size is misleading.  4XL is truly too big for me,  but not in this case.  Very disappointed."
4.0,"Little flimsier than I thought it would be for the money, It will hold 2 hats."
4.0,[[VIDEOID:ef98c206cdec49ae3c23b253da201c30]] It's well made but it's cloth is thin.
4.0,"I like them, I got one for me and one for my sister. I have to see how long it last without turning copper so we shall see<br /><br />(Mind my lipstick stains on my arm)"
4.0,Very cute and priced well
4.0,"Torso length was accurate, chest area was a touch big. My child wears a size 10 slim in clothing. It's quality is well made and came with matching scrunchie. Color is more on the turquoise (green-blue) with shine and detail of material as shown. Delivery was within timeline, but arrived sooner than expected.<br />Four stars due to color as it looks more blue-green in the picture which is what attracted me in buying it.  Overall satisfied."
4.0,"A little narrow at the toe, but they're cute and stylish. The leather is stiff, but you will definitely have to wear them over and over to break them in. Besides the lather being stiff and a narrow toe, I love the boots."
4.0,Fits well and super soft for me. My boyfriends keeps coming apart not sure why. Doesn’t look like it latches 100% to face of watch. Also not what is in the picture. The part with the notches is like the basic bands and not what is pictured. But I love the colors. Just what I wanted.
4.0,I loved these earrings they're great for the value I've had them in a very long time now I noticed that the label on the earrings have rubbed off if you have them Loosely with other earrings in a bag or just loose in a bag what the label didn't rub off for a very long time
4.0,It states in the description that it is a dark gray however it is more of a Toby color than any Gray. Other than that I am so far pleased with my purchase.
4.0,"The shoulders are a little snug, but it's still comfortable and fits fine in every other way."
4.0,Nice good coverage not that thick but comfortable.
4.0,Quality is equal to those I found in brick & mortar stores but for less money. I like that I can carry it by the handles or cross body. I also added our baseball team logo decal to personalize it. Many uses when going to any event that requires looking through your carry in bag. I can't speak about durability as of yet because baseball hasn't started. I will update review only if I feel it doesn't hold up to normal wear & tear
4.0,Nice station necklace. Comfortable and pretty
4.0,"Although I could easily give this 5 stars, and I like the product, one of the features is having digital displays, and they are fairly - typically difficult to see, and without the perfect or optimal conditions.  It would be nice if there were better contrast between the window color and the pixels for the digits.<br />I can also say that in getting a couple watches like this, they show a brilliant color (in this case purple), and when you get the product it ends up being vastly lighter or darker than shown or you thought it was going to be.  This ""purple"" almost looks black, and similarly a blue one that I purchased ended up having a dull gun metal blue.<br />Casio's are excellent products, whether for wear or show, but I believe they need to work on these aspects a bit more."
4.0,"The quality is great, but it's a little snug on the legs. They will work great to sleep in still, which is the reason I bought them."
4.0,"Looks good for costume uses. Fits large on a standard adult women’s head but they may have taken into account some people may be putting it over a wig, I think it would fit more secure that way. Has little snaps to have it stay creased up, or unsnapped to have flat brim. My snaps do not stay together so I will likely just superglue it."
4.0,This are good quality and looks comfortable but we returned them my wife didn't like them coz they were long and look like for tall women. Happy shopping
4.0,"The purse is made of a nylon material mix so it’s very light weight.  I really love the medium size and all the pockets are a plus.  Easy to wash off spots and the strap is adjustable to wear as a cross body.  The emblem on the outside looks like a marshals bag and I’ve had ladies ask me if it was a concealed carry purse.  It’s large enough you could use it for this purpose however, I just use it for my day to day use.  Love the size and the quality of the zippers and stitching is top quality."
4.0,"Super cute, a little on the cheap side..... but it's for a 6 year old..."
4.0,"These were very nice and such a great deal for the price. i unfortunately chose to return them though because they fit too large. I am usually a small in tops, so I chose to order a small because I read that they run a little big and I am 35 weeks pregnant. They were still too big though. I live in south Florida so these would have been great as they are very light and it does not get very cold."
4.0,I brought this as a gift. A little on the small side but still great for my grandson. I would not want to give it to an adult person that shaves. but for teenagers or even to a female it would be a very nice gift.
4.0,It looks great . Goes with everything.  Including my Speedo.!
4.0,pretty but to large
4.0,Super cute fun bag for work !!!
4.0,The first dress from Max Studio I received with a tag!!!! All other dresses I ordered had no tag on it. The dress S is good fit for 5'6 170lbs bust 36B.<br />The color is bright red. I like it.
4.0,Nice just as described.
4.0,"The quality is honestly pretty good! I was expecting worse material. I got the large, It was really snug when putting it on ,but once on it was pretty comfy! I would size up for extra room but overall nice :)"
4.0,One of the clips was broken
4.0,Very comfy- Great buy!
4.0,"I bought the blue one. I am 5'4"" and weigh 123lbs. I got the medium and it was a bit too small/tight :( the material is nice. I may end up buying a large in black (the blue showed off my mom pooch a bit too much). It was still good quality for the price."
4.0,"A little more snug than I anticipated. However, an OK value."
4.0,"Despite it being a $30 risk I couldn’t resist ordering this costume and I’m so glad I did!! You’d think there’d be more sexy candy cane outfits out there, jeez, anyway....<br />I was actually pleasantly surprised by how it fit! I will probably replace the belt with something else that looks similar but is a bit better quality, I have a small waist and had to tuck the end into the belt a bit awkwardly since there is no loop to tuck the end into. The leg warmers are not as fluffy as in the photo and the candy canes are ironed on a little haphazardly but for imitating a $150 costume it’s really not bad for $30. Definitely not a dress for my holiday party but if you’re a stripper go for it!! I’m wearing some leggings I cut into shorts underneath. My measurements are 34-26-38 5’9 155lb if that helps at all."
4.0,I like the ring I sent it back only to reorder it again because I realize how much I like the ring. I wish the Center stone was just a little bigger.
4.0,"I wear a 44ddd and the 3X was the right size. The pads take some getting use to, at least they are removable. Very comfortable racerback straps. Support for low to medium impact activities."
4.0,"It's cute. Obviously it comes folded, so there is a seam set in that you have to steam out. Great sunhat"
4.0,Finally quality Cargo like pants made for a woman's body!  I am always forced to but mens/boys cargo pants/shorts do to the lack of quality I find in women's styles.  All the women's cargo pants I've found are of cheap material and not as functional as they should be.  I highly recommend these to any and all.  The length was a little long for me at 5'4&#34; so hemming was needed.  I just wish they would offer a short in this style!
4.0,Fun to use for my class to make Fathers Day gifts.  Some of them were a little hard to open but I would purchase again!
4.0,"Love Kut jeans! I bought a size a little too<br />Big but I’m keeping them. Love the boyfriend cut, love the color. Great jeans!"
4.0,"I love these pants! Very cute and comfortable, and the open sides happen to be my fav style. I wish the flaps on the sides were not as prone to opening, but a quick sew job will fix that right up. They are a bit sheer and because the shorts built-in are white, you get to see the lovely line where they stop. Overall, very happy and would recommend. For reference, I’m 5’4” and curvy and about 145lbs and I got a medium (I have short legs)."
4.0,"Inner clip easily comes undone. The wallet is unforgiving if you even modestly overstuff it. Else, it works as intended."
4.0,Really very good
4.0,They were crushed in the box .
4.0,"I like it but if you will take a good look at the quality, not that great, just so so. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm not that fussy so I'll still give it 4 star because I like the style, sexy but you're still protected."
4.0,It made me look sexy.
4.0,"The earrings are beautiful! Just like the pictures, but they arrived too late. They were a birthday’s gift for my daughter but they arrived 2 weeks later!"
4.0,Very Nice  dress. Superb material
4.0,"It's really pretty, but would have loved the pockets to work, its looks cute but I think that not as good as on the photos they display"
4.0,"I really like these watch bands, and like that they are narrow.  I really like the design."
4.0,Got this for my husband & it looks great on him! I Would have rated 5 stars but the color is a little different from the picture (but I guess that's expected with wood)
4.0,The quality seems to bye nice for the cost.  It was a gift and the recipient loves it.
4.0,"I bought this top to go under my corset. It is pretty shapeless in and of itself. So it's really not something many would wear by itself like the picture shows. The material is neither soft or rough, it's somewhere in between the two. There is elastic in the top hem only and it feels like it is strong enough to stay off the shoulders when worn. It fits pretty big so do not go up in size, if anything go down one or two."
4.0,"I really like this bikini. The top is very adjustable and goves the girls quite a boost! You can tie the tie in the middle tighter or looser to adjust the pushup effect. The top does hold alot of water when swimming and I do feel like I might fall out lol. The bottoms are more coverage than I normally wear, but they are reversible and flattering. They have the ruched line to make the booty look good. Overall I like it alot, and would recommend. For reference I got a size S and I am 5'6 and a b cup and about 125lbs."
4.0,Okay dress as far as quality.<br />Cute
4.0,My hair does not get messy. like it.
4.0,Looks nice with my dress
4.0,If fits nice the only thing bad I can say is they don't mention there's blue in it. The picture looks like it's only black red and white.
4.0,"Nice product,  shipping was fast."
4.0,Extremely long but once you figure out how it wraps it’s easy to put on. My only complaint is that once wrapped it pushes the fat up and creates a bulge around the bra area. I’m keeping it as I’m working out in hopes to resolve this issue 😬
4.0,"at first I was upset because I received the wrong item.. but once I got once I saw this pendant in person, it is larger than I expected and the person I got it for was very happy"
4.0,"Does the job. My daughter only got them off once. Shes a busy 1 & likes to keep nothing on. However, these been great after her initial piercing ones came out & look good to."
4.0,"Shirt fits fine in a 5x.  Maybe a little thin on the material.  I had to resew the buttons after a dozen washings.  Color seems to be holding up well, and material seems a little more durable than 100% cotton though it is cool being mostly cotton."
4.0,Item arrived very fast. Although at first glance they looked very small. They fit perfectly. Very happy with my purchase.
4.0,"a bit thinner than I thought they would be, but worth the money."
4.0,"Love love love this dress...comfy, perfect length n price. The pockets are super too. The only con is the top portion needs a cami cuz u can see though it but it’s still a must have. I plan to order more."
4.0,"The flared bit of the plug may be the right gauge.  But the saddle bit is smaller.<br />Basically, you'll lose these in bed every night. I'm ordering 0g to replace the 2g and hoping this resolves it."
4.0,"Love it, very comfortable.Great for running errands."
4.0,It's a bit scratchy but lightweight
4.0,Very pretty. Brighten clerk commented how pretty my Brighten jewelry was the other day!
4.0,"Like that it's very thin, but don't like that the money shows."
4.0,Super cute very flattering
4.0,"I just received my costume in the mail! I tried it on and it looks great! I recommend buying this costume if you have the money<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great quality (better for that price!)<br />Looks sexy, nice fit- surprisingly flattering.<br />Very detailed<br /><br />Cons:<br />The Velcro spots aren't that long, so I had to add more Velcro to the straps. Also, the torso on the costume is a little short. I fit otherwise, it's just a bit of a stretch.<br /><br /> I recommend buying this costume if you have the money, you just may have to invest a little bit more to buy extra Velcro."
4.0,"Ok, but one of the charms was off the bracelet when it arrived"
4.0,"Nice socks, but wish the print in the socks was a little more crisp"
4.0,So cute. My 2 yr old loves them. Warm overall. Only con is that bottom insole is not fur lined.
4.0,Pretty design but the cups were too big for me. I need a large size but small bust. Nothing fits me. The quality was much better than the no-brand-name.
4.0,Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it was folded so tightly that the fold lines made easy tear points and it tore a few times. Easy fix with tape but I would have paid more for shipping to have it come rolled instead of folded.
4.0,"These bags are pretty large and hold a good amount of groceries. They also feel sturdy and I had no qualms about loading them up with canned food.<br />The one gripe I have about them is the opening. Because of the way the handles are designed they don't open as widely as I would like which makes them less ideal for larger things like cereal boxes. Since I have an assortment of reusable bags already this is not a deal breaker for me.<br />The other potential negative about the bags is how they fold back up. They're not going to fold back up in as small of a package as they came in. This is not a big deal to me since I don't plan on keeping them in their individual storage pouches. If that's the main draw for you then you might be less pleased. If you spend a lot of time folding and fiddling with them you might be able to get them flatter than my photo, but it will be a process....<br />(Obviously the bee photo is new and unopened while the cat design is restuffed by me)"
4.0,"It's cute enough. I'm 5'9&#34; and 132 lbs with a 34C chest. I ordered the large and it is slightly large under the arm, but nothing a little sewing can't fix. It is long enough that I can wear it with flats. I ordered the red, light pinky peach, and the minty green floral. You can see the pockets through the fabric of the pink faintly. It's not horrible though. The pattern is detailed and doesn't look cheap on the pink so that is good. The pattern on the red looked cheap, but surprisingly, my favorite was the minty green. No pockets showed and the pattern looked nicer than I expected. I honestly thought it would look the cheapest. So, to recap, pink is good; red was a no; and green was the best!"
4.0,nice fit sexy. good deal for the price free ship also.
4.0,This satin pajama set is very pretty. It's a two piece set that has a cami and shorts. It's very lightweight and quite comfortable. It fits as expected.<br />The top is a little strange and can be slightly uncomfortable in that it has an extra flap in the inside that rests a little strangely. Other than that it's a fantastic little PJ set.
4.0,"Keep in mind, this is cotton and will shrink"
4.0,"beautiful necklace. I wish it was a bit longer, but it works great with long tunics that are plain."
4.0,"The colors of the shirt are nice. I weigh 125 and I'm 5""4. It is very oversized so I think it will fit anyone. There some loose threads here and there but that's fine. The collar is okay but it doesnt matter since I wear it unbuttoned. It is a bit itchy for me because I have very sensitive skin but only a little. I honestly think it's a good shirt and I feel good when wearing it. If you want to have a shirt that's like suga's then get this.<br />💜💜"
4.0,"I bought this for a DragonCon costume, mostly because the price was right. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the belt when it arrived, however. And the ratcheting mechanism is very cool. I'll have to see how it hold up at Con before rendering a final judgement, but so far, this is significantly better than I was expecting. And if it works out well, I plan on getting at least one more (black) for every day use."
4.0,"I bought this for myself because I love bracelets so much! And this one was really cute. However, after one week of wearing it, the leather was cut suddenly and with no reason and it cannot be fixed somehow. I am really disappointed with this purchase and I don't think I am going to buy a similar item again.<br /><br />**Update**: The seller contacted me apologizing for the inconvenience and sent me a brand new bracelet! I was really amazed and thankful at the same time.. I only wish the first incident hadn't happened."
4.0,"This bracelet is kind of bulky, perfect for a larger man. I purchased it for my son and he wears it every day. It has gotten a little rusty because he never takes it off. I assume it could be cleaned, but he doesn't seem to care."
4.0,FITS WELL AND ARRIVED QUICKLY. I GET COMPLIMENTS EVERY TIME I WEAR IT.
4.0,"Great gift for a young tween or teenage girl. If you daughter or granddaughter is like my daughter, then she loses a lot of stuff. Therefore, spending a lot of money on an expensive necklace would not be feasible. This necklace looks very nice and and can be worn everyday. The chain looks alittle cheap, but looks okay. It is worth the purchase."
4.0,"i would rate this item a 3.8. very pretty BUT i just received them in the mail last night, wore them to work only a few hours later (i work the night shift) and just realized some of the rhinestone fell out today after my 9 hr shift. im kind of upset but the earrings would probably still look good with just a gold background as opposed to the tiny rhinestones. i received compliments from a coworker. i didnt think people would notice them as they are pretty small. still a good buy."
4.0,"Fabric flows nicely. It's pretty sturdy for a beach dress, and living on a lake it will be a nice bit of polish for weekend wear. There were a few stray threads around the woven parts by the straps, but they were easy to trim up."
4.0,OOO!  OO-OO!  OOOO!!!!  (Translated by Monkey:  I like it.  It's just as expected.  Would buy again)
4.0,Love these booties! Very comfy and versatile. I wear them to go to work every day! Elegant and casual at the same time
4.0,"Cute shirt, a little snug and a little sheer, but super cute."
4.0,It is slightly smaller than I expected but at the same time if it were much larger it would probably be too large.  It is difficult to find a breast cancer survival pin that isn't a huge button.
4.0,I like the look of these slides.  I had some trouble adjusting to the upper midfoot support bump built into the footbed and initially could only wear them an hour or two as they made my feet quite uncomfortable.  I seem  to have adjusted; can now wear them for several hours.  I like having a supportive slide I can slip into when I need something on my feet and don't want the hassle of putting on shoes.
4.0,"First, the not so great stuff about these work out pants. I ordered a large in this size as I typically wear a medium or large at a store such as Forever21. When I pulled these out of the packaging, holy cow.....they definitely run small. I didn't think at first that they would fit, I was kind of scared to even try to put them on. Much to my shock, I was able to get them on and not only that but they were rather comfortable! However, since the product is super stretchy, that means it sheers out when it expands. You definitely couldn't see anything but I know I would want more of a barrier between me and that creepy guy who stares at me at the gym. However, for yoga at home or to sleep, they were great. The other not so great thing was that they were sort of short. For me, this is no problem. I am 5' 2'' and these landed just at my ankle bone. I am used to pants bunching up a bit, so a short length worked well for me. However, I would say if you are anything about 5' 3'', these might start turning into capris for you. I know the title of the clothing says capri, but it shows a full length pant.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a very comfortable product. It was super comfy on, the material is soft (if not a little thin), and I am happy with my purchase. Just keep in mind that they DO run quite small. I received a discount for my honest review and this is truly my experience with these pants."
4.0,"Kid loves it, saw it was 100ft water resistant, sad to see his watch wasn't because it was a huge selling point for me as a parent of a 3 year old. But he loves it and we just slide it up for hand washing and take it off for baths."
4.0,"I like the sturdiness of the metal, the details, and variety of how I can use this piece. It is a little too long for an average, everyday necklace but it will be great for special occasions. I think I will also hang it from my backpack for show."
4.0,"I essentially agree with all other reviews.  The fit and feel are quite nice, especially under slacks where you want a little suppose and not quite Shapewear.<br />My only question (hence only 4 stars) is that there is an odd little invisible zipper (about 3 1/2&#34;) across the front panel.  I've purchased and worn many panties in my life, but have never had any with an unexplained zipper.  Yes, the zipper opens a little pocket."
4.0,Little short so be careful on a windy day. Super cute everyone thought it was so cute at work.
4.0,"5&#34; 5&#34;, 130 lbs...waistband is very comfortable and length is good...not crazy about this color however...very sheer and casual looking...<br />I do love and have the brown, dark green, black and purple ones...can go super casual or dress 'em up! My must haves for the summer!"
4.0,"From reading review, expected it to be a little long but everything else fits. Great jeans for the price. I cut off about an 1.5 inches and hand stitched red and pink hem to make it look somewhat retro. Googled on YouTube and found great ideas to fix up jeans. Love them and know it is one of a kind😂"
4.0,I bought for my girlfriend to use. She is quite small and can never find disposable gloves to fit. These work perfect for her. The only downside is that they tear fairly easily.
4.0,"These are a better fit for adults, they’re much too large for my kids"
4.0,looks like the pic
4.0,The red from the sole bled onto the shoe material in spots. But it's not noticeable unless you're up close. My son loves the fit and look of these shoes
4.0,"These socks are very soft and warm, but one pair arrived with a large hole in the toes and you have to put them on carefully or your toes get caught in all the threads inside."
4.0,I got this to use at a wedding and it was perfect! It was big enough to hold what I wanted to bring without being too large
4.0,I like it very much however I think the size I choose is for a man
4.0,"The stitching on the top of the sandal, which the bottom of your foot touches, takes a little time to get used to. I would go back to another Olukai style, if I could do it over again. Little pricey for the comfort, when comparing to other Olukai models."
4.0,"I really love this... it's a little clingy in the booty, so be sure that it is meant to fit. I admit that the XL is a bit small for me (I wear a 16/18); but, I imagine it is perfect for a 14/16. Wear your no-panty-lines undergarments!!!"
4.0,It’s a little small for my nose and it kinda hurts. But it’s super cute for one night
4.0,"So beautiful and it fit perfectly. However, the zipper has already broken. I used it as a costume piece and it fit the job. Not recommended for regular wear."
4.0,can't wait to wear it
4.0,Very nice looking chain for the pric
4.0,Works very well although I wish it had a little more filling.  Fits fine and stays in place.
4.0,Very cute. Nice material. Fit true to size.
4.0,Haven’t worn yet but it is lovely and fit as expected. Be careful as it’s easy for lace to get caught and tear
4.0,It's alright!
4.0,I like the ring and will wear it often.
4.0,"They seem to run on the small size. I ordered 2 pair as gifts and exchanged  M for a L. If you’re close to another size, order up."
4.0,"This is such a thick cardigan. I've worn thinner ones in my lifetime, and I wish that this were one of those. The stitching is also very large, so if something gets between the strands of fabric, it could unravel part of it. The color is nice, and the thickness does make it warm for Winter, so there is that!"
4.0,"Dress is pretty, has pockets, and fits nice. The material is a little cheap but the cost is low. I would pay more for a lining in the dress and better material I like it that much. I highly recommend the dress"
4.0,"The catch/fastener is too small & does not open easily, the chain itself is beautiful, but when I'm in a hurry not a good time to waste 3-4 mins trying over & over trying to get the catch open."
4.0,Beautify pair!
4.0,Does what it's advertised to do and a bit bigger and cheaper then others here on Amazon. Would also suggest as a companion that people check out Jeweler's Rouge in the red color for cleaning and polishing jewelry.
4.0,This item arrived on time as as was advertised. Nice piece my daughter really liked it. I would order again from this seller.
4.0,"The yoga pants are great, BUT the legs are super long.  I'm 5' 8&#34;, but have shorter legs, so I'm used to pants running a little long.  These are so long that the if I fold the pants down along my foot the emoticon is at my toes.  If you have long legs, these would be perfect for you.  Other than the length, the are very comfortable and fit great.  If the length was shorter, then these would be my go to yoga pants."
4.0,Comfy. A tad bit large.
4.0,It is beautiful but I returned it. It was just too dark for a late spring wedding.
4.0,"Material was good, fit a medium size body after letting the laces out...leaving just enough to tie. It’s very comfortable and definitely worth the $. However the buckles were difficult to latch while looking down."
4.0,I Like them
4.0,One of them was a little damaged with schatches
4.0,It looked nice but was very rough
4.0,I like it. Good look for the money.
4.0,The sizing is on the small size but the length of the leg is excellent
4.0,This dress is being used for a 40s style tap dance number .
4.0,"I like the belts, but the buckle is wider than the belt. Not critical, but for this price it should be a better fit."
4.0,You really have to guess when it comes to sizing on these.  The pair I grabbed fit me just fine.  These are pretty stretchy as well and not your typical jean material.  These are way shorter than Bermuda though and a little too short for my liking.  I was expecting them to be thigh length and they are not.
4.0,The dress is too large but it's lively for informal wear.
4.0,"Really good material, not too thin or rough. I use these as head scarves, and they work really well. It’s the perfect size for my head, luckily, but it could be a little bigger. The patterns are really nice, and they do well after washing."
4.0,Nice fabric and fits right. The only problem is the shirt gapping coz the buttons are really close to the lining.
4.0,My daughter used these for her Halloween costume. She had three parties & they held up well. She lost a couple of feathers but nothing serious!
4.0,Nice top for the price. I wish it ran just a bit longer..... being over 6' tall length is always a stuggle.
4.0,Short but fun.
4.0,They work fine - to that durable but work for a bit.
4.0,So far So good we will see how it holds up
4.0,Love this product its so adorable.
4.0,Like the material. Fits as expected
4.0,I was worried that the fabric quality would be cheaper - like you'd see with a costume rather than a daily-wear jacket; but the quality is good for the price.
4.0,"the dress was nice, but tight sleeves, too large dress.  don't like high waist."
4.0,"The shirt is gorgeous and a great quality! Love the green color! I wish it hung off my shoulders a little more and was a little longer, but I would still order again from this seller!!"
4.0,"I normally wear a small. Followed the advise in the comments and ordered a Large, Large fits perfectly.  This design is a quick and easy way to be a little dressed up which I love b/c I'm not a big fan of jewelry.  The &#34;buttons&#34; that make up the center of the flowers are not fabric, they are only covered in fabric.  I think they might be made of metal.  I was momentarily pulled aside after airport security check-in scan.  I don't care, I looked cute!"
4.0,"Love these! I bought these for our newborn who we put in nightgowns a lot for easy diaper changes. It's middle of winter, so his little legs are exposed. These keep his legs warm with access to still change his diaper weigh without undoing buttons and zippers every few minutes. We bought the sports pack and are cute in him. They're a little loose on his legs but one end of the let warmers and a little tighter to keep them up. So good for now and later because he'll grow into them this year. One downside is that the warmers are not finished on the inside with loose strings. I saw this on another review before I purchased. So, make sure when you're putting them on, you since them all the way up with your hands (like your put nylons on yourself) to make sure nothing can get caught on babies toes. I'd buy more of these overall!"
4.0,"It's much bigger than I thought but looks nice and expensive! The leather is top-rate<br />and I like the zipper enclosure since I will be using it for travelling. It's very light too,<br />unlike many expensive brand name  leather bags I have purchased in the past."
4.0,Love that it comes with multiple inserts in a variety of colors
4.0,"it works as designed and as described. but i think i'm going to find a more compact and workable design. the long chain for fobs (or whatever) is a bit too inconveniently long to hang outside the holder. the inside link (where i put my 2 fobs) makes the inside space so cramped it's a bit difficult to zip the holder up.<br /><br />weirdly enough, it also puts enough pressure on any internal keyrings that hold multiple keys that it can actually put enough pressure to unlock the keyholders and have them fall out.  scaringly, i saw my mailbox key lyihng on the ground just outside my apt door when i came home from work one day having NO CLUE that a key had come loose when i left that morning trying to zip it up.<br /><br />terrifying to think that could have been my apartment key.. RIGHT in front of my accessible apt door left there all day long b/c of this."
4.0,The 100% cotton top is super soft and looks nice.  The ruffles on the shoulder are not sew down on the front of the shirt and create some or tails hanging down.  Otherwise the design and muted rainbow stripes are quite classic.  This is listed a size L for 8-9 year olds.  This would be more of a tunic length for that age range.  It would fit more as a dress on the 6-7 range.  The style is pretty forgiving and certainly looks cute oversized.
4.0,For the price I don’t think you will find a better sandal.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:37958e2c79c4c6407ceff96db5f20b9c]] I already have the blue coveralls so the mask is just the cherry on top. Halloween is going to be a scream.
4.0,"I saw this in a department store but as I already had a great brown everyday bag, I walked away without purchasing it.  Several weeks later my husband spilled gasoline on that great bag.  Oh well!  I was happy to find that this Lucky Brand bag was still available. I purchased it from Amazon, it came in the mail quickly and was just as described.  The leather on the body has this great crinkly look to it.  The only thing about this bag that I wasn't sure if I liked at first was that the leather on the handle is different than the leather on the body and it is not quite the same color either.  It has since grown on me and I am happy with my purchase."
4.0,Love love loved it
4.0,I like the stretch belt.  Sturdy and works great.  Good quality.  I came back to buy this dual colored belt and i don't Love it.  Prefer the solid colors.
4.0,Not exactly sure how to get this on as of yet but I'm still working on it. Lol. Hopefully soon I can figure it out.
4.0,"Very comfortable and soft. I wear this around the house as a blanket rather than out as a scarf. It is the perfect size between a small throw blanket and a large scarf. The only criticism I have it that it is VERY linty and sheds a lot. This doesn't bother me very much as I don't go out in it, but it would create a mess on someone's clothes if they wanted to wear it out."
4.0,These swim shorts fit nicely. But they are a little loose on my thigh. However they come with another “underwear” attached  so I won’t be flashing anyone in the pool. They look sporty and fun. Can’t wait for summer.
4.0,"It requires a bit more work than I thought and what was my impression from the description, but in the end it gets the job done."
4.0,It runs small in my opinion. The sleeves and bottom rise up with every movement. Unfortunately I’ll be returning.
4.0,Im 5'5 130 pds and i got the size 6. Dress fits as expected and looks like the picture. I wish more of a mid drift showed but i am happy with my purchase overall. It shipped quickly and came in great shape. My boyfriend really loves it so im happy! Would recommend.
4.0,"I liked that it was lined, not see through. Liked the ruffle lace details & the non slip off the shoulder sleeve. I didn't like the shade of red because it was pretty far off from the shade in the image & not what I was going for. Also, given the stretchiness of the fabric, in this shade every roll on your body would be noticeable. I would definitely feel more comfortable wearing a slip that shapes me underneath. I also prefer the waist on a dress to seam a bit higher then this dress did. It seemed to cut my waist at a less flattering place. I ordered a small & it seemed to fit well. Not sure if a Med would fit as well. I would consider this dress in another shade or style if I need in the future."
4.0,"I did not need an expensive checkbook cover so this is what I decided on.  It is not the best made, nor is it best quality, but it will satisfy my needs and do what I need.. That is hold my checks and transaction register.  I don't use it that much so it may last me several years but that is all I need, and want, right now. There are 2 checkbook holders in the order so these should last several years."
4.0,Wears well. Good good tone.
4.0,With the coupon making it $7 its worth it! Granted it only lasted me 2 or 3 times but for 7 its not bad. It fits well and is super comfortable! After the lace is ruined it makes good pajamas. The other dresses in this price range on Amazon have not fit and showed up looking bad not like the pretty sales picture
4.0,adorable undies!  My 3 year old granddaughter is so small.  We have not found undies that do not gap at her legs.
4.0,I was skeptical about these socks but still ordered as it was pretty good deal and thank goodness I did..it's true to the color shown in these pics..6 neutral color combo.Bought it for my 16month old daughter. As we stay in Midwest it will keep my daughter's feet warm during winter.I will definitely recommend. 1star less as it doesn't stay up for long time...New year to all..
4.0,"Love the design and doesn’t look cheap. I did have to use a chain extension for it, but overall it’s sexy and I love wearing it."
4.0,It's very comfortable and warm. I just don't like the colors like I thought I would and the sweater makes me look like I have a weird shaped body.
4.0,Terrible packaging looks like a return item they run small as i wear a 9 and had to order a 10 also dot a little extra with my package and not wraped correctly. The shoe is cute and comfortable but probable wont order from this company agaiin
4.0,"Love the top.  However the skirt is very full for such a heavy satin, so looks a bit like a pumpkin shape.<br />The skirt fabric is really too stiff for this style.<br />I intend to take some fabric out of the skirt to slim it down.  Took 3&#34; off the bottom as I am 5' tall."
4.0,It is very good looking glasses but limited fits. Only for small face of men.
4.0,I seem to fit between a L and an XL.  The feet in the L are too short. They pull my toes.  So I tried and XL which was way too big.  I gave them away and the person loved them!
4.0,"Shiny, a little unique in design. One part underlay the ear from the behind while the stud push thru the front with four small holes. It was a little difficult to get in at the beginning. Cubic zirconia is well secure in plate. No complain from the mrs."
4.0,Nice quality--comparable to Alex & Ani.
4.0,This bag is casual and stylish. The description did not give dimensions so I think it's a little small but I am petite so I'll reduce my items and use it for the summer.
4.0,Nice tops
4.0,"They look great! They're just a little loose for my ears but other than that, love em"
4.0,Came on time.
4.0,"In the beginning, my toes weren't too flexible so my initial experience was bad. But after a few days, the socks are allowing better muscle memory, blood flow, and flexibility..."
4.0,Dangle nicely off the earlobe. Ear wires a bit too thick and hurt my holes. Got compliments from my co-workers when I wore them.
4.0,"Contours well to body. Looks great, feels great. Only downsize, shoulders straps are a bit loose...may need fabric tape. Overall awesome dress! Size Small perfect for a size 5, 5'2&#34; 130lbs gal"
4.0,Could be a better fit
4.0,The keychain appears to be very well made. This is not cheap for a keychain but with all the kakao friends craze the price was not that bad. These products are difficult to get in USA.
4.0,Came fast as expected.  Testing out because I am having reactions with other earrings.  Hoping these work for me
4.0,It was so cute I wore it for my 21st Birthday trip to Vegas!
4.0,Sleeves are a little long.  Otherwise a great shower.
4.0,The socks are warm and soft but they are thick.
4.0,"Cute shirt but I wish I ordered a smaller size. I’m 5’7 and 150lb, small waist but broad shoulders and 36 D chest…I ordered a large like I usually do but wish I got a Medium because even the chest area is baggy. I like the shirt though so I’m keeping it"
4.0,Beautiful Clutch.  Better Than Expected!
4.0,I like it different from the rest.
4.0,"I wish that the top part would wrap around the breast a little bit better instead of leaving a gap maybe make it more of a stretchy material instead of it being so stiff. The only thing I would change on this is maybe the zipper should be a black plastic instead of metal, the zipper gets really hot in the sun. I would also like to have it where it has 2 bottoms where one would cover just a little more so when you go to the beach where it may not be appropriate to show off your bottom too much it would be nice to have the option to have have a backup pair of bottoms that still matches the top.  :)"
4.0,I like the bra it fits good the only thing is I wish it had some kind push up at the bottom.
4.0,"All sellers that I have dealt with so far have been very courteous and  made my shopping experiences a pleasure. I will for sure use each of these sellers on a regular basis. I have had only one problem with a product arriving damaged but looking for resolution, the seller replaced the product with no hassle whatsoever. I would recommend Amazon and the sellers involved in my purchases to everyone."
4.0,Great produc.
4.0,"I wasn't overly impressed with this blouse, but it did fit as expected, it doesn't have that much shape to it really, it's up to your figure to make the blouse look good, the zipper on the side is nearly impossible to zip up and down when it's on, but when its off it's easier cuz you can you both hands but I found it terrible hard once the blouse was on....it's just ok"
4.0,"These are super soft and comfy. However, they arrived with a strange smell and they pill VERY easily. They are cheaply made, so expect the quality of cheap pajamas. That being said, I like them for chilly days, but not for SUPER cold days."
4.0,Very cute dress. The color is great as well. The only negative thing I could say is it does have cut outs so you can’t wear a bra or you have to wear a tank top of sorts underneath it.
4.0,It's gorgeous!!!!
4.0,Very nice skirt for the price
4.0,nice hat to wear with long hair
4.0,"This is a beautiful piece.  Lightweight,  colorful & made fairly well."
4.0,"Fits good. Looks good. Only deduction for me was that the belt thing was way out of center and made the hat look like it was on crooked. And despite the valcro in the back, it was glued in place. So I had to tear it off, re-center, and re-glue.<br />Besides that I am pleased with this buy."
4.0,"I like the dress - I'd definitely buy it again in other colors. The fabric reminds me of swimsuit material, it's really silly and smooth. I'm about 5-8, 230 lbs w/ 38DDD - I order an extra large. The dress is on the longer side which is surprising became as a talk girl things are normally short on me, but it is nice to have something longer at work"
4.0,Matches bear from in store
4.0,Para cóctel
4.0,"These boots run slightly small - My toes are right to the edge of the boots.  I still can wear them but I would have ordered a half size bigger if I knew they ran small.  I did notice that after I wore them for a full day the ball of my right foot was sore.  Due to lack of support on the soles of the boots.  Would not recommend buying for work if you stand on your feet all day.  I like how they look, the color is very unique."
4.0,I do recommend these socks it really  relieves  swelling
4.0,"These fit up to my knees (I have a 35-inch inseam) and fit my 18-inch-wide calves, with some room to spare. The construction is not that great, but they look sexy."
4.0,cute but returned it
4.0,Small but that was what I wanted right now.  Like the color!
4.0,"These glasses are pretty good, not the best quality but they're just reading glasses, so that's not a major issue.  They arrived promptly and they were well packaged. They're attractive and look nice on, but they were a little too large for me.  I have a habit of wearing glasses on top of my head until I need them, and they were constantly falling off, as they do not have spring hinges.  They were comfortable while wearing for work and reading, and the lenses seem like ok quality with no distortion, but it was annoying that they kept falling off.  That was more me than the product though so I still gave them 4 stars for what they are."
4.0,"I am a huge KB fan - I was during and even after the birth of my 1st baby this year. Of course I get the emails and am definitely one to jump on new products and especially good deals. Just got my kimono delivered today. Cute fit, even 6 months postpartum, will be great to have during my next pregnancy as it could be paired with practically any solid top (which I live in). The one and ONLY thing about this kimono that killed me is the smell of it coming out of the plastic. If I was pregnant it would probably bother me more....but it not quite a manufactured smell...but I don't know...just something not right. I always wash stuff before I wear it....so I am going to give it a wash and 1. hope the smell goes away and 2. hope the fabric can stand up to being washed. I know KB always improves their products over time and this being the first run of this product I can only imagine that it will get better. Whether that be more color options...etc. Overall, cute concept.<br /><br />Also.....I noted the model in the picture is wearing a NAVY simply sublime tank.....so I really hope that that is going to be released soon....because it is really pretty!"
4.0,Good small gift for most occasions.
4.0,"Not the color purple I wanted, but will give away as a gift.  Nice clutch and right size."
4.0,nice item..like it
4.0,"I really like the wallet, however the chain is very annoying sorry to say.  I took the leather strap from my old Buxton wallet and put it on this one as the chain gets caught in too many things."
4.0,I really like this dress. Every time I wear it I get compliments. The only issue I have is in the description. Looking at the product description it mentions that the dress have pockets. This is not true for this dress. THERE ARE NO POCKETS. Just be aware if you want a dress with the feature b
4.0,"Honestly, it's a pretty smooth zipup but the collar and cuffs are really thick compared to the rest of the clothing. I got the blue one and love the color, plus the contrast of the inside pattern makes it look pretty Sharp"
4.0,These are beautiful on my stethoscope.
4.0,I like that they are comfortable and don’t hurt my mouth. I really just don’t care for the shape.
4.0,"I like it, but the white sheels are waaaay bigger than i thought. I will keep it though. I ordered another product last here from here and did not get a bracelet. However, this time they added an extra neclace which is pretty cool and nice of them. Product is good, price is good, They even add an extra item. 4 stars because i like it. Just bigger than i expected."
4.0,"Gorgeous color! Much more gold and less pink than in the photo. Cut the pink in half, and then you're looking at what you get.<br /><br />Nice quality, bright and beautiful. Whatever the lenses are made of finger prints ridiculously easily. I've had several pairs of Oakley and Ray Bans aviators over the years, all mirrored, but these ones get filthy fast. The lenses are also extremely difficult to bring back to polish. Once they get a bit of oil on them, it smears and smears for what feels like forever, even with cleaner and the polishing bag.<br /><br />Overall, I love the color and that they are not manufactured by Luxotica. The price is right as well.<br />I take off points for ease and frequency of cleaning, and size. The lenses are gigantic! FYI, they are huge."
4.0,"It looked huge when I got it, but after washing (gently, no dryer) it shrunk.  It's light and exactly what I was lookin for."
4.0,"Very cute, screw back works wonders. Gold plating is rubbing off slightly so that is disappointing, but overall great earrings"
4.0,"Cute hats, however use hot glue to put balls on or they will fall off"
4.0,"I would definitely not call this a medium support sports bra, more like a very light support bra.  This was made for small breasted women, for sure, it comes with thick padding. That was the downside of this bra for me,  the pads were not removable.  However, I did manage to remove the padding, with some difficulty ( it was glued to the inner lining).  I'm happy with my A cup, do not want padding.  The bra is soft  comfortable now, it  doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything. I ended up ordering it in all colors."
4.0,"Smaller than expected, stainless dulled pretty quickly. It's okay, not great. I guess I can get some stainless cleaner."
4.0,Way too long. I am 5'6&#34; and needed to remove about 4 inches.
4.0,"very pretty color, fits well, looks great. I really like it."
4.0,"This bathing suit is beautiful.  I haven't purchased a bathing suit in many, many years.  I don't like to swim and I am a larger woman so I am not comfortable in most bathing suits.  When I saw this one I decided to give it a try since it is so pretty.  Although I don't normally swim it is nice to have a suit on hand just in case.<br /><br />The fit of the suit is a little smaller than I was expecting.  I am not too worried about it since suits tend to stretch a little over time.  Once that happens it should be just fine.  The skirt part of the suit is nice and flowing.  The colors are beautiful and it is a nice suit for a larger woman.<br /><br />I received this swimsuit at a discounted price in exchange for my opinion if the item."
4.0,These lenses fit pretty good in the original Oakley Batwing frames. They do have a little bit of a loose side but they don't fall out of the frame. The lenses themselves around the rim of the lense have a weird distortion for some reason? I'm not sure if this was my lense specifically or what? But the distortion for the most part is covered up by the frame but you can still see it if you are looking in a direction that looks through the edge of the frame. Overall still good lenses if you are looking for a decent priced replacement. I had a set of MrLenses in the frames last and these are darker for sure.
4.0,"I love compression clothing because it helps get the blood circulating but boy do these smell after a workout!!! Yuk!!!! I know it’s an issue for all the sweat wicking stuff but these were really bad, after a wash it got better though. I’m not sure why the first ware was different. I thought it was me but it was the case for all three shirts and I wore the adidas in between."
4.0,Order 3x
4.0,So cute! Comfortable.
4.0,My baby is 2months old and these socks fits her perfectly and they are so cute on her legs....Highly recommend buying these.
4.0,"These earrings are very pretty, but a little too heavy"
4.0,Im happy with this bracelet.  Ive worn it three days straight and even swimming.  I have to use the last link because my wrists are smaller than what its made for but all in all for the price...Id get another one should this one break.  LOVE IT
4.0,"Nice and comfy, a little long for me, I'm 5'2, so it looks weird with leggings."
4.0,Not a watch band if you work in a factory not study that way mine is bend and broke but for every day use it’s awesome  I love it !
4.0,I ordered size 9 which 41 but I got 8.5 which is 40. So the strapes cant tie.
4.0,Nice little purse. It looks so cute in person. The only  thing is the smell. It smells like something that has been in storage for too long that it starts to mold. Or you can say it smells like mildew.
4.0,Wallet was of excellent quality.  Embossing wasn't that deep as shown in picture. Still liked product alot.
4.0,Great rugged travel bag.
4.0,"It's cute, but sort of stiff feeling. Maybe it will break in with some time."
4.0,"Easy to use, clear directions, good product. I have used the liquid and the cream and they have worked well to shine up my jewelry. I am pleased with this product."
4.0,Gown is really nice only reason my daughter didn’t wear is because the wrap around bottom piece did not fit. The material is like a satin and gown is small sequins. I would recommend she just couldn’t fit that bottom portion! All in all it’s a gorgeous piece for a formal even bought for senior prom
4.0,"I really like this shirt.  It is a very high quality tee shirt.  And as you will see from the tag in the picture below it is a Hanes tee shirt, 100 percent cotton.  It is thick and you can not see through the fabric.  It will hold up very well and for a long time I believe.  However, it felt just a little too small for being a large and that is why I knocked a star off. I typically wear a size large in tee shirts and it does pull on me a bit through the stomach area. as you can see on the large E on the side.  The sleeves though fit fine and did not feel tight on my arms.  This shirt is not for me however but for my children's grandmother. She is not as busty as I am so perhaps it will not pull as much as her.<br /><br />The purple color is VERY vibrant and anyone that loves the color purple will LOVE it, you can see it coming from down the street I can assure you. And the shirt does go down to your hips so there is no worry that your stomach will be exposed if you raise your arms over your head. And the v-neck does not go too far down so I don’t think you have to worry about the “girls” making an appearance in this shirt.<br /><br />I believe that if you are purchasing this as a present you will be proud to give it. I know my kids are already excited to give it to their grandma!  I received this item at a discount in exchanged for an honest and fair review, and you got one from me. (Sorry but I could not get the pictures to turn around the right way.)"
4.0,"Cute Bracelet! Colorful, beads are pretty, seems good for the price."
4.0,"I wear 9.5 or 10 in regular shoes. These boots, size 10, were snug, I got them on without socks."
4.0,"This fits well, but the &#34;hot&#34; pink is more muted than the pictures suggest. I'm disappointed by that, but it still looks nice."
4.0,It's everything it said it was. Good product for price. If you have a complaint you should've bought a more expensive one
4.0,"The silver is very bendable, but I have worn it for over two years now, almost every day. I have enjoyed it very much and will try to buy it again after my current anklet wears itself out (I am rather hard on jewelry)."
4.0,"Pretty, but shorter than I like my skirts and opened up when I walked exposing my entire leg. Gave it to a shorter, younger girl that loved it. She didn't mind the skirt completely opening lol"
4.0,"Should have bought a large, but I like the roomy feel-XL fit more like xxl.  I'm buying another color in L  for night time, but everyday this will work.  Good material, soft."
4.0,Lasted thur 15 hour delay 11 hour flight and four hour car ride. Great socks.
4.0,These are so cute. Good buy
4.0,Very nice looking belt.
4.0,Great color. Just in time for Easter!
4.0,the material is very soft and light
4.0,"Very good looking shirt. Material is very thin, but for the price, its a good shirt."
4.0,"Love the look, price and service, only ine complaint with the material."
4.0,Loved the color and design but the fit was odd. Top was a little large but washed it and it fits much better.
4.0,"Very nice tie, went well with my ivory shirt at my wedding.  I wore it with a charcoal suit and a grey vest."
4.0,My son loves his new practice pants.  Just wish that the zippers would have zipped down towards the shoes instead of staring at the shoes.  Was looking for more of a tear-away pant but this works!
4.0,"As others said, the band is huge and will need to have links removed."
4.0,they seem to be a well-built slipper. But order at least one size up
4.0,Beautiful bag but beware extremely short straps and doesn't go easily on shoulder. More of a hand carry bag. Will be returning....
4.0,A little thick for a light sock
4.0,"I ordered this as a gift for my best friend and I think she's really going to like it! The pendant is beautiful, galaxy is very vibrant and moon crescent is shiny and thick. The chain is approximately 9&#34;and long at its shortest hook (it has a few extra loops to adjust length. The only two reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the chain (while beautiful in its own rights) looks like it would kink easily. The pendant is also larger than I expected. Though this may have been mentioned in the description. I bought it at the tail end of  a flash sale and didn't have time to read the description. Either way, I'm very satisfied!"
4.0,"I really liked this dress. It did a nice job hiding the extra weight I carry.  I’m 5’4 and weigh 195 pounds. My bust is 431/2 inches- measured over my clothes. The length is close, but will need to hemmed 1-2 inches to avoid stepping on it. I will likely reorder on this, as I have returned this one be because the left side pocket must of been sewn in wrong cuz it pokes out and it very noticeable. Right side pocket was great in comparison , as you couldn’t even tell a pocket was there, it laid flat and smooth."
4.0,"The belt smelled horrible for a couple of weeks, but it doesn't anymore. It's very soft material that will probably not last beyond 6 months of almost daily use, but we shall see. It fits as expected. It's cheap, so it's still a great product for the price!"
4.0,Very comfortable!! Great for long road trips in the car!
4.0,Especially like the towels on the side. A great place to dry your hands
4.0,"I wear a medium, but ordered the XL (in red) based on reviews. It just barely fits me. I do love the top, it's not itchy and feels okay on my skin, but I'm disappointed by the color. In the photos it's more of a darker red/burgundy-leaning red, but in person it is a very bright true red."
4.0,I’m 5’3” so I sort of expected this but it is definitely much longer than I had anticipated. That being said it’s very pretty and looks cute!
4.0,"Decent blouse with a loose, comfortable fit. Definitely runs small as it is coming from Asia. I usually wear a medium when I want a loose fit but I got a large here. It's just slightly bigger than my normal fit but I like it. The red color is on the darker side."
4.0,The toe ring is super cute.  Have to be careful changing clothes.  It tends to get caught.  And when sleeping a time or two I have gotten caught on a blanket or sheet.  But overall love it.
4.0,"The slippers look good. They arrived on time. They seem just a little small, not so much to make them unwearable. Perhaps they will stretch out a little over time."
4.0,"I like nearly everything about this watch strap. It was easy to install, is continuously adjustable (no discrete steps in the length, as there are with watch bands using holes or removable links to control the length), and is very lightweight and comfortable. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's a bit hard to take off, which I have to do every few days to charge the watch (the OnePlus watch). The problem is that there are five ""hook"" patches near the end of the strap to secure it, and those patches are slightly thicker than the rest of the strap. In order to make the strap long enough to get it over my hand, I have to pull several of those patches through the gap between the pin and the watch body. They fit, but just barely, so taking the watch off and putting it back on is a bit of a chore. I deducted one star from the rating for that inconvenience, but overall, I'm delighted with the feel and the ability to set the length and tightness exactly as I want them."
4.0,"For less than $5 you can't really be picky.<br /><br />This product came way earlier than expected. It doesn't include the stockings, just the garter belt. But it's pretty, fits well and well made.<br /><br />And it's far cheaper than I've found on other sites!"
4.0,My son loves it and it fits great!
4.0,enough Good
4.0,"I normally wear a small in everything so that's what I got. It was a tad bit small making the straps a bit too short but not so much that it couldn't be worn. I'd recommend sizing up. I'm 5'6&#34; and about 133lbs. The color was as advertised and the material is good, stretches and not too thick or thin."
4.0,A little bit baggy then I thought but super cute. Will be ordering more in a small
4.0,Beautiful shoe but we have to return due to sizing issues. Runs about a half size large!
4.0,Good belt! My only complaint is that I'm a size 10 and I had to add 2 holes.
4.0,"This is pretty nice for the price.  We put some of my dad's hair in it.  The connecter is kind of cheaply made and my hair constantly gets caught in it, but I wear it only for special occasions."
4.0,tinie but nice
4.0,"The price is right, the fit is good. I like these socks.  http://amzn.to/Wi469m"
4.0,"These are so cute, it's a shame they are so uncomfortable that I can't wear them. The quality is good, the color and style is beautiful, but ouch, the straps hurt. Go up a size, that should help. Unless you are tiny and in perfect shape. I didn't return this item, it's too cute, so I can give it to one of my smaller friends. I am 5'5"" 135 lbs and purchased the medium."
4.0,"Happy with product, little rough around edges"
4.0,Was slow to start glowing but after bout an hour worked well.
4.0,"pendant is very pretty; the chain broke on it minutes after opening, had to get another one."
4.0,"These glasses are a little bigger than I had hoped and I wear another smaller pair when I am just sitting at the beach or whatever....but from what I see around these days, big is in.<br />They are perfect if you are looking for full coverage of your eyes though.  They wrap around perfectly and are super comfy - great for running as well.  Great price too."
4.0,Looks great overall pleased with the size and look. Dropped one star as it makes a rattling sound nothing appears to be loose from what I can see but its where the blade meets the handle. It'll be hung on a wall mount.
4.0,"My mom and I love to share jewelry so this was perfect to split among us. She liked the ones with a little more bling, I like the smaller, simpler ones."
4.0,GREAT PRICE!! The range of color choices are amazing. Good quality product. Only negative was I wanted orange and all that was in stock was a burnt orange. Otherwise Very satisfied.
4.0,The necklace is very strong. The ends were difficult to get into the charm but I was able to in the end.
4.0,"I bought this for a satyr costume that Im creating from scratch and OMG...it looks lovely! But if fits somewhat small. I ordered L and had to open the back almost all the way up, so next time I'll go 1 or 2 sizes bigger. Other than that it's very lovely"
4.0,"I really like the necklace, i had to wait a while to get it (kinda forgot about it to be honest) so shipping does take a while. The actual pendant is pretty and well made. I do feel its a little smaller in size. But overall a great product and well made necklace."
4.0,"They feel nice and my butt looks great, but the material is not squat proof in a deep squat.  It's kind of like super thick tights versus leggings."
4.0,Fits well. Will use them for exercise or casual wear.
4.0,"Purchased these last year. Color is bright and pretty. Material itself is thick, somewhat stiff.  But durable. only complaint is when my daughter went to put hers on the tie string broke right off while she was fastening. would still recommend"
4.0,Bought two for my granddaughters for Christmas.  They were very nice the the girls loved them.
4.0,"This is a nice shirt. It's definitely a football jersey, made with that kind of see-through mesh that is common. It is well made and seems sturdy. The material, however, is not at all stretchy.<br />The size is very small, too. I'm a big guy, and I like my clothes to be a little loose on me so I usually get 4XL, which normally gives me loads of room and is nice and loose. This shirt, though, is much smaller than I expected. It fits me, but just barely. If I wore a t-shirt underneath, then it wouldn't be at all comfortable. For me, it feels more like what I would expect a 2XL to be, not a 4XL. The combination of it being not at all stretchy, and being small, combines to make this a much less desirable shirt.<br />Still, if you got a size that was comfortable to you, then it would probably be great. Just remember to order way larger than you would expect. For me, it felt about two sizes off. That's why, even though I'm very disappointed in the size, I still gave it 4 stars. It's a good shirt, just small. It doesn't say one way or the other, but I suspect it's made in China or Korea, so you have to expect it to be small."
4.0,Works as I wanted.
4.0,"I like the thinness of the bracelet, and the subtle pave... very believable!"
4.0,"It's a cool piece, well made, but here are my gripes: not a true bronze color, it is quite dark and painted on, also, the parts where it connects to the other piece have rather sharp corners on them, so be careful, and it is quite large around the pectoral area, and it's tightest setting is not tight enough, though I could move the straps and get a better fit.  It was also extremely wide around the torso, and I couldn't put my arms down, but I bent the thing into a better shape.  Overall, I'm pleased, but I will either buy a different one or have to do even more additional custom work to this piece in order to get it accurate looking, and fitting well."
4.0,"This necklace is just too big for my taste.  It is not dainty at all, so I feel it appears a bit gaudy.  If the constellation charm were not so large this would be a beautiful necklace.  Just not for me or any of my family."
4.0,"Comfortable, as described, two thumbs up."
4.0,"Looks exactly like the picture and because of prior reviews, I did get it two sizes bigger and it fits perfectly. It's long, just like I wanted. Very satisfied. I just wished it was a little bit thicker for the price."
4.0,The shirts run small but they are good quality
4.0,Loved jeans but zipper was cheap and broke
4.0,Runs a bit large - had to re-order a smaller one.  Adorable on the baby.
4.0,"The first trait I really like about this shirt is that, although it uses the same Blue Sun logo we saw on Jayne Cobb's shirt on Firefly, there's nothing big and glaring on here that says ""Firefly."" Too many branded products like this will have the trademarked source in large type, usually between the shoulder blades, which detracts from the immersive experience. This shirt has a copyright notice in teensy type below the main logo, but only someone standing uncomfortably close to your torso will ever see it.<br /><br />This really looks like something you could wear to a science fiction convention as low-rent cosplay and get away with it. The green khaki color has an artfully pre-faded look that suggests years of wear, like maybe you've worn it while performing maintenance on your spaceship. I'm not blessed with a body like Adam Baldwin, so I can't attest whether you'll look suitably chiseled if you wear it tight across your pecs. But it has the sort of shabby chic look that genre fans want when wearing their favorite branded merchandise.<br /><br />The fabric is somewhat thin for t-shirts I've worn recently. So while it looks like you've worn it while doing space maintenance, I wouldn't recommend actually doing so; I suspect it will tear under hard-wearing conditions. It has a suitably middle-weight feel, appropriate for, say, jogging on a summer's day. But chances are, if you're buying Firefly-branded merchandise, you probably don't intend to wear it while doing anything that would cover it in sweat stains. So the lighter weave probably won't hurt you much.<br /><br />In brief, this product has the look which Firefly fans will want. It looks weatherbeaten, but it feels solid enough for most leisure-time activities. It's long enough that you can tuck it into your trousers, if that's your look, and roomy enough that you can twist your body to the extent most people will under normal circumstances. That is to say, you can wear it and do things, and you can wear it and look cool to fellow Firefly fans. It does everything you need a branded t-shirt to be able to do."
4.0,Just as described lets just it's worth d price.
4.0,"I am 5'4 and 155lbs and ordered a size large. I ordered this for a bachelorette party since it was cowprint themed. I love the overalls however, I could've definitely gotten a size medium. I knew when ordering this it could be a little big but the medium was out of stock. I'll still wear for the occasion but it very comfortable, lightweight and cute!"
4.0,This did not fit as expected. Smaller than expected.
4.0,"Very cute and great for work with dress pants. I’m not sure about the material though. It’s super comfy but every time I touch it or sit down, it wrinkles SO MUCH AND SO EASY. Other than that, I would definitely purchase it in more colors."
4.0,I needed a top real quick and I found this. I was excited about it but around the waist area not so much. The amount of material shown in the picture as extra for going around your waist that is not the case. The sleeves are billowy and that was fine.
4.0,"Great dress. Just didn't realize the slits went up so high. Had to contend with a right front, right back, left front, left back when sitting. Don't like the cutesy tie in the back. The dress itself was as you'd expect after this."
4.0,"I was slightly amused to see how much trouble people had with this cleaner. I have owned 3 pairs of Ugg boots since I bought this cleaner with the original first pair. I have cleaned black, brown and grey boots with it. I never had an issue figuring it out and they never made my boots worse. The only thing I can imagine is these people got the boots too wet, scrubbed too hard and/or dried them wrong. It really doesn't take much water to get the boots wet, a quick jet under the sink wets them more than enough. I always use a brand new normal sponge and throw it away after (I could save it, I probably should). After washing I stuff the boots with plastic bags or clean dish towels to hold the shape and I just set them on the floor in my room to dry. After a day or two they are ready. There is no reason to rate this cleaner badly, it is the people who use them who should be rated badly. I definitely could imagine people soaking the boots and scrubbing the death out of them. Truth is less is more with the solution, the wetting and the scrubbing."
4.0,"I usually wear an adult small, so I got a junior xl so it would have a looser fit on me. Fit as expected. Great graphic and shirt material, but the hem started to unravel after washing it. That didn't bother me, but just an fyi."
4.0,Great looking but I need to lose  weight
4.0,"These sunglasses are not that bad, but the lens are not dark enough.  However, they allow me to see very clearly and everything is very sharp.  Also, the frame is a little too thick and bulky.  But, for the price, that are not bad at all."
4.0,"Great jacket but definitely size up, it runs small even for slim fit"
4.0,"Love the shirt and color , but glad I ordered a size bigger as it runs small"
4.0,Awesome product arrived in time for mothers day
4.0,"Nice band, it really changed the look of my watch."
4.0,"Great product, the outside zipper got stuck and now I have difficulty. But I still love it and get compliments all the time for it!"
