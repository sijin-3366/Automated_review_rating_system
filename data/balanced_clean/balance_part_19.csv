5.0,"Great skirt for the golf course. It fits perfectly, stretchy and has that little flirty feel to it. I plan on buying a few more different colors. It‚Äôs very affordable compared to other golf skirts!"

5.0,The print is very pretty and the top is not see-through even though it is incredibly lightweight.
5.0,"Update:<br /><br />Previously I had written a not so great product review; however, the seller has worked with me and the customer service has been exquisite!<br /><br />The bag is a good bag, just not for what I needed it for. I suggest buying from this seller!!"
5.0,"Excellent feel, Stays warm, No complaints"
5.0,"The swimsuit fit well. I ordered size small and it fit according to my size. I love the pattern and color of the swimsuit, perfect for the beach. This one piece is a low cut halter so it‚Äôs sexy without being too much. This swimsuit  is sexy and flattering on."
5.0,son superchulas

5.0,They were a gift for my mom. She loved them! These gloves keep her warm and they're super comfortable.
5.0,"I really like this jacket. The fabric is soft, comfortable  and the style fits me well. I can wear to office or dress down with jeans for a more casual look.  It‚Äôs a great light jacket for spring and summer. I bought medium size for a loose fit but I believe a small size would fit as well."
5.0,Great weight and sturdiness
5.0,They looked great on her she loved them
5.0,"I completely love this t shirt.  First of all, the shirt FINALLY fits well on WOMEN, it's not boxy but it's still comfy like a t shirt SHOULD be.  Love it.  Second of all, the dist. was awesome and wrote a personalized note on the receipt.  Wonderful service!  THIRD of all, WHO IS JOHN GALT? ;)"
5.0,"This bow tie set is awesome. I, for the most part, prefer vibrant colors and the colors on these ties do not disappoint. When they arrived I immediately put them up against several shirts of different colors and patterns. They will truly enhance my wardrobe. These ties arrived in a few days from ordering, so thanks for the prompt processing and swift shipping. I would not hesitate buying from this seller again.

5.0,"I love this dress! The only thing I can say is that it is very long. I had to pay to get it hemmed, but I got it for such a good price that I didn‚Äôt mind paying a little extra to get it shortened."

5.0,I love this mask! The fit is perfect and I can breathe easily when wearing it.
5.0,"This is one of the greatest pieces of jewelry I have bought for myself. It is extremely sturdy.  The piece is heavy, but it reminds me it is there, reminds me of my faith. The chain is perfect. I thought it would be too long; not so....just perfect. I extremely recommend it to any man or boy that is a Christian!!!!"
5.0,It‚Äôs great ! Love it

5.0,Love the MICHE Ellie Red! Item arrived exactly as pictured and brand new.
5.0,"Been my trustee watch for about a year now. It functions very well, the buttons are intuitive, it‚Äôs got a great look, and it truly is water resistant. I‚Äôve accidentally swam and showered with it on and nothing has malfunctioned. Good quality for a good price."
5.0,"OMG, these are the cutest little sandals & I loved the comfort of the fabric on the bottom & the top so much so that I was on a weeks vacay & wound up wearing them every single day instead of any of my other shoes I brought w/me!!!"
5.0,It was a gift for my husband and he just loved it
5.0,"Excelente, todo el mundo me la alago en la calle, realmente espantosa"
5.0,Very comfy slumber pants and the logo was bigger than I expected!
5.0,"Short and sweet: This is a lovely scarf. It is well made and works well for the purpose. So far, it is working very well and I have found no flaws. The silk is very soft and has a lovely sheen. In purchasing, I did notice that the very close up photos of the center of the scarf, swirled up, and then the edge of the scarf, give the best representation of the colors and darkness of the print on the fabric. The two full photos, the large photos that show the entire scarf laid out, for the one I originally ordered, are lighter and the colors are muted compared to reality, but the edge photo and the sort of scrunched up center photo are very accurate as to color. I ordered more and found the same to be true, so make sure to study the close up photos for color and tone on these scarves. The scarf reviewed is beautiful, as are the others I purchased from this brand. This is a wonderful product. As to this specific design, color 18, it contains a tree of life, with a new tree at the base, and a phoenix design, both symbols of fertility, and I bought a couple to give to friends who just loved the motif. The red and blue and gold scarf with the tree makes a fantastic gift for any mom in your circle and anyone looking to become a mom. Good luck in your search."
5.0,"It‚Äôs just as described. My son loves it. Good quality, seems like it should hold up for a while."
5.0,Easy and comfortable to wear. And it‚Äôs a statement. Wear something simple and this will pop!
5.0,"Love the one shoulder swim suit. The material is great, lots of support. I feel young wearing it!"
5.0,The twins love them.
5.0,Perfect fit for the size. Included a tool to adjust just in case. My son loved it and said it was comdortable.
5.0,Cool sweatshirt
5.0,A perfect fit.  Thank you.  I am so tired of going to the stores and only finding jeans that don't even cover your belly button.  These jeans go to the waist and fit perfect everywhere.
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and weigh 149lbs 36c top and I have a little bit of a booty I ordered a medium and it fit perfect . It wasn‚Äôt too tight or too loose. The slit comes to about mid thighs . Sexy enough to wear out but not too sexy to wear to work . The material is thick enough so it‚Äôs not see through and it comes with a built in slip. I love this dress and will buy more
5.0,Beautiful!  Very happy with this purchase! Extra rhinestones 'just in case'.
5.0,Everyone loved this thing. Hilarious!
5.0,"I get so many compliments on this purse, I should buy one in every color :-)  after about a month the zipper to one internal compartment did break but I didn't use it much anyway."
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture. I bought it for my sister for Mother's Day and now I want one for myself.
5.0,"Nice simple dress, good fit and length"
5.0,Fits all my curves perfectly.
5.0,I got this for Christmas
5.0,That is the most fluffy hat ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,"I have purchased this back in 2014... I think it is gorgeous! My sister liked it so much that I bought one for her too =-).  I love the design it has a nice shine and sparkle. Over time it will tarnish if not worn often,  but it is easily cleaned up with a jewelry cloth. I did just notice that one stone is missing (2019)...well worth the purchase price!  I will be ordering another one!"
5.0,My kid bought these and loves them.
5.0,Little loose but my daughter will grow into them
5.0,This ring is absolutely perfect!!!  It is exactly what I wanted!!  I‚Äôve ordered a few rings and know that without trying them on in person it‚Äôs a gamble.  This ring fits perfectly to size and is my perfect engagement ring!  Thank you for creating such a beautiful product!
5.0,"I love this jacket.  It was exactly as described.  It is quite loose as noted, it is not a fitted jacket.  I found that it fits just as it looks in the picture."
5.0,Really comfortable and high quality material
5.0,"I just got this today and was so excited when I tried it on. It‚Äôs a little longer than I expected, but I like my shirts longer so that made me happy. It‚Äôs definitely long enough to wear with leggings. I would suggest a cami underneath, but that may just be my preference."
5.0,The rings are nice. Came as promised.
5.0,Trendy shoes
5.0,This sleek and sexy dress. So comfortable wore it to a wedding and absolutely loved it.
5.0,"I love it I wear it all the time, it's so comfortable...great buy."
5.0,Even prettier in person! So happy with this!!
5.0,"First time I received something that really does what it says.  I have a messed up tendon down my left hip and leg.  Put these on and I am not kidding, I was able to go shopping with no pain.  No pain later in the evening either.  I do think you have to get the ones with orthopedic qualities. I have other Bare Traps, which I love, but I can't wear them shopping.<br />I bought this blue pair and just ordered a second pair in gray.  Wonderful shoes, even if not these exact shoes, get the ones with arch support.  I am 67 and thought my favorite sport was over. LOL!"
5.0,This outfit was perfect!! I could wear it at work or out on a date I completely loved this item!! I cant wait until they have more clothes in stock so I can purchase them!!
5.0,"I gained weight and my swimwear was too small. To protect my skin, I decided to find fuller coverage clothes for swimming.<br />These shorts are very comfortable,  perform well in the water, and I have also worn them as exercise shorts. They are pretty cool.<br />There is a liner, so I don't have to wear panties or an uncomfortable seam on sensitive areas.<br />I don't like the ties at the bottom of the leg. They hold water, and you drip like crazy. So if you need to get out of the pool to go inside you leave a trail of water.  I cut them off, and hopefully solved that little problem.<br />The weight and stretch of the fabric is impressive.  It feels high quality.  They are made in China, and I know some people are trying to avoid products made there.<br />The blue color is nice."
5.0,Fabulous!
5.0,correcto
5.0,Nice item and fits nicely. Lot of compliments. Would buy again in different color.
5.0,So cute. Fit perfect on my small 15month old!! It also fit my 6yr old.
5.0,"These shoes are adorable. I ordered the pale blue pair and I absolutely love them. The embroidery is beautiful and the shoes are well made. The blue was a little darker than the image shoes, but still a pretty color. I usually wear a size 7 to 7.5 so I ordered the size 38 shoes, but they were a little snug."
5.0,"I bought the Brown one as I wanted something a little smaller than I could find in other bags (without being too small.) Just right for me. I love it (& as you may read in my review for the Gray version, so does my friend...)<br /><br />So now I find they only let me right one review when the only difference is color.<br /><br />Well, I've been trying to convince my buddy (who is not gay) to consider carrying a bag for the last couple of years. When he saw my brown one he got excited so I bought him a gray one. (It's easy to be generous when the item is so inexpensive.) He loves it and carries it everywhere. (It also didn't hurt that his Mother told him it was very European & he was style-en.)"
5.0,"My son is the ultimate Kobe fan, and he loved us. I love that it is stitched instead of screened printed.<br />This is a staple piece for a true basketball fan!"
5.0,Bought as a Christmas gift for my 18 y\o granddaughter. She loved it!  I bought it a bit larger than needed to she could snuggle down into it.
5.0,Great piece!  A not so expensive gift for the little wife for putting up with me!!
5.0,Gifted it to my year old grand daughter. She loves it
5.0,"Great replacement for the original watchband that came with the watch.  Far better quality than the original watchband.  The watch I have it on is the Timex Men's T40051, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TIISW/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  Almost cost as much as the watch but together looks very nice."
5.0,Arrived timely and as advertised... THANKS!
5.0,"So happy I ordered these! Made very nicely, material is cool and comfortable. Breathable for someone with asthma. Ear adjustments are great since my teenage daughter can fit them as well."
5.0,Love the prints and durable fabric.
5.0,So cute and so pretty! I bought two sets so that I could wear them both in my double piercings.
5.0,Great quality jacket!  Love the inside lining!  It‚Äôs light yet warm!
5.0,"Wow! This is an amazing, well made, beautiful hat. Yes, it's expensive, but if you want a great sun hat that looks sharp and will last for years, it's worth every penny."
5.0,This fits great is very attractive and feels very high quality.  It looks great when I am dressing up and still want to get those steps in.
5.0,Great fit for me. Very comfortable. Doesn‚Äôt hurt behind the ear
5.0,"Perfect fit for my 24 months old. Love it! Shipping also quicker than i expected, so my daughter was able to wear it for ‚Äúbreakfast with santa‚Äù."
5.0,Very nice dress<br />Flattering fit....<br />Bought it in black and have worn it to a cocktail attire wedding as well as a couple of shows in Las Vegas..
5.0,"I absolutely love it. The price is super reasonable. A great fit, my head circumference is 21.5 inches. Nice style and love the color!"
5.0,This was cuter than expected for a simple white top. Received many compliments.
5.0,I have very dry skin and I love these socks as they do not dry out the tops of my excema prone feel.  Will buy more colors as cash flow allows.
5.0,i bought two of these for my two sons and they both LOVE the slouch beanie!
5.0,quick service and great product
5.0,Love them too cute.
5.0,"I was afraid these wouldn't fit my face because I have a fat face, but when they came today in the mail they fit perfectly. Now I can serve severe LOOKS in theseüòç"
5.0,"I love it.  It was large enough to accomidate all of my earrings, looks really great on my dresser, and even still has room for those extra ""Sparklys"" that are bound to follow me home from the store from time to time."
5.0,Love that it has mutliple compartments to keep stuff seperate from the water bladder.
5.0,Love the goggles when my rides are highway road trips. The wind is not a factor and they don't seem to fog in the summer weather as advertised.
5.0,"These shoes are very comfortable and well made. The color is very nice and looks great with black, leopard and olive."
5.0,It worked perfectly with my earrings fast delivery
5.0,I have received so many compliments on this top (must be worn with a Cami) it is pretty and feminine.
5.0,Didn't dislike anything. I used it for my watch.
5.0,Worked great. Good quality and got lots of compliments!
5.0,"Super trendy necklaces! the quality is very good the gold is not too yellow looking which is what I look for. They look like they are 14k gold not gold plated. You can't use them individually as they come pre attached to each other so they wont tangle, my wife really loved that. Over all very good purchase!"
5.0,I absolutely love this dress! I got so many compliments. Around the armpit area was just a little loose but not really noticeable and doesn‚Äôt ruin the look or anything. I also love where the seam on around the midriff sits. Most dresses like this the seam sits up higher making my stomach and hips look bigger but this dress doesn‚Äôt do this at all. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and the dress length is about 2-3 inches below my knee
5.0,I really love these leggings! They are incredibly soft and not even a little bit see through. I just ordered a second pair in another pattern. They fit pretty good But if I was any bigger they might be a little uncomfortable. I usually wear a size 6 pants. 5'4&#34; 120 lbs.
5.0,Great deal for the money.  I keep these driving sunglasses in my car so I will always have a pair available.
5.0,Just as pictured (A gift for my Aunt and she loves it)!
5.0,Cute pastel rainbow Dino feet slippers with light up claws! Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"As any fan of the Red Plume brand knows already, if you wear a size ""Large"" in the USA, you need to order a size XXL for a snug fit or at least an XL - which will be very, very TIGHT fitting if your typical USA size is ""Large"".  These shirts are insanely high quality for the price... I bought my first one (A Captain America variety) about 2 years ago and it has survived over 25 uses at the gym / washing in a machine washer and tumble dry... all with MINIMAL FADING and virtually no loss in compression.  That's quality you don't expect for less than a ""Hamilton"", price-wise! :)"
5.0,My daughter loves it.  I wish there were more ever after high clothing products
5.0,Absolutely loved the shoes! Very stylish and my son can run great in them. Got them quick and product was just as expected. Thanks so much.
5.0,"Excellent quality leotard. My daughter wears a 7-8 in regular clothes and needed the Child's Large. No big deal, just needed a size up. :) Love the Leo!"
5.0,Perfect only wish it came with a charging cord
5.0,They are awesome
5.0,"I bought this for a friend for her birthday.  She was very pleased with it and is looking to wear it often,  The pearls were of such good quality that my friend's daughter (who is a jewelry designer) was very impressed with the quality of the pearls and the setting.  I will look for more items from your company the next time I am in the market for pearl jewelry.."
5.0,"A beautiful fitting dress, hope to buy more only different styles"
5.0,"Fits Perfectly! For a relatively inexpensive price, this is a nice looking lightweight Spring jacket. It is soft and warm enough on days when you need<br /> a little more than a short sleeved shirt. Plan to make good use of this jacket this Spring."
5.0,I read the reviews before I purchased this shirt. Most of them said the shirt ran at least one size larger than normal. The reviews were correct. My husband usually wears a 2XL so I bought him an extra large XL  in this shirt. It fit perfectly! I recommend buying this shirt one size smaller then you normally wear.
5.0,Wanted a small backpack to use as a diaper bag for my toddler. This is the perfect size and the straps are adjustable. Love this color too!!!
5.0,"This is a pretty, lightweight wrap.  I use it like a shawl, either over the shoulders or head.  It‚Äôs good quality and I will likely get another one, in a different color.  I like it that much!"
5.0,"I bought these to wear daily to the gym or to run errands. I wanted something small, comfortable with a secure closure. These earrings are perfect and exactly what I was looking for. I actually bought a second pair to gift to someone."
5.0,"NIce item, fast delivery. Highly recommend. Thanks"
5.0,"This dress is very pretty. It would be suitable to wear for fancy parties. It has good quality and feels comfortable when worn. I ordered medium size so it‚Äôs a bit large for me. However, I loved the material and the details on the dress. The sequins are sewn perfectly. It‚Äôs not damaged anywhere and looks exactly like the picture."
5.0,The bags are great and well made and I have two other SAK American Flag bags but like this one the best - just wish all bags had a hook inside for car keys - so easy then to find them -
5.0,"My teenage son loves this!!! He is tall and thin and we were worried that the large would swallow him, but it doesn't. It is a nice fit. It isn't form-fitting, but roomy, which is just the way he likes it!"
5.0,¬°Hermosas!
5.0,"So soft, love it!!!"
5.0,"Nice and soft,my niece loved them!"
5.0,"Best multifunction organizer purse I have found yet - and I have tried many.  I was so sad when I fell recently and the handle tore off on one side.  A local tailor was able to stitch it back on.  He even commented that such a well made, well organized bag is hard to find."
5.0,"This dress is made of a thick material, fits nice only thing its a bit too roomy for me but highly recommended"
5.0,"quality and style, really nice pair of shorts"
5.0,I love this pack.  It's very durable and very flexible to add attachments etc.
5.0,"Very comfortable, fits as expected. Material seems to be durable, but soft enough to be comfortable."
5.0,Exactly how described
5.0,The dress is very soft. Not a thick material but not so thin either. Got an xlarge and it fits fine. The middle at the back is lose but that‚Äôs because of my measurements.<br />Bust 38c<br />Waist 34<br />Hips 50 üò¨üòÇ<br />Weight 189 pounds<br />5 feet 4 inches<br />Soft and pretty.
5.0,These will make your shopping unpacking much easier.
5.0,For daughter
5.0,I‚Äôve bought this same hat three times.  That‚Äôs how much I love it.  Folds up and fits in your pocket.  Washable when placed in a laundry bag.
5.0,"Very good quality, great fit, perfect for cool days. For the price I thought it would be pretty cheaply made but it seems to be very good."
5.0,"Comfortable, love the design. I love it"
5.0,Bought this gift set for my boyfriend as a little gift. Totally worth the price. Everything in it was a nice quality and lots of stickers. Very pleased! Good variety.
5.0,"One for the Home team, I got this as a present, I have wanted it for a while and actually purchased it once but sadly it came back out of stock. I like the Idea of 2 straps one for bigger wrists and one for smaller. I love it..Just in time for Superbowl sunday, I will be buying the Royals Baseball version of this in the spring. GO KC!"
5.0,Wear it when my hands won't be in water.  Works well
5.0,Cheap but perfect if you're just looking for something simple and comfortable. Not heavy duty but I love it.
5.0,Nice quality and good cost!
5.0,Not the exact color I wanted but great fabric
5.0,"My 13 year-old daughter needed a dress for a semi-formal event. After searching stores with no success and less than 7 days before the event, we went online and she selected the lace dress.  The price was amazing, the fit was perfect and it looked better than ANYTHING we saw in the store. She loves it!!!"
5.0,I bought this for my sister and she loves it!! She said it's used everyday for teaching and or a large purse. She's overall very happy with it.
5.0,"The material is soft, sizing is accurate, & although very comfy is still cute."
5.0,Good quality product and very fast shipping.
5.0,"Love these shirts! (I have 4 colors now) They do run small i get a 5x-6x and I typically wear sz 14 but have a large bust (34J) . They are soft flannel and warm. Hang dry or dont use heat bc they do shrink a little. If youre worried about that, you can buy another size up and you'll be fine. Great with jeans, pencil skirts or leggings!"
5.0,"Large, spacious bag.  Like the fact that your shoes never touch your clothes.  Strong material too."
5.0,Super cute!  Decent quality at a great price.
5.0,"I ordered this dress for my Step Daughters 7th birthday party. Her theme is &#34;Royal Ball&#34; and she wanted to wear an elsa style dress since the dress code is princess dress for her party. The dress arrived in a few days after ordering, the material is beautiful also. It looks like it does in the stock photo and the rhinstones are beautifully placed. The only diffrence is i thought the sleeves would be a bit longer but they are beautiful none the less. Shea going to LOVE IT! Also appears to be true to size fit."
5.0,This skirt is super cute!!!! It looks better on than I expected
5.0,wonderful hat.  Soft & comfortable & does not ride up on your head.
5.0,"I ordered these for Christmas presents for my teen daughter.  Even though I didn't get to pick the colors, there was a nice selection included in my shipment, with the exception of the two solid bracelets, which weren't as pretty as the multicolored ones.  These bracelets are versatile and very comfortable if you want to add a pop of color to any outfit.  They were a big hit with my daughter's friends, and a great deal for me, since I paid  about $2.50 per bracelet, versus the $10 - $12 prices I've seen in some mall and accessory stores.  By the way, when I purchased one in a store, it came with a 'Fair Trade' card that indicated it was made by a local artisan.  I don't know if these bracelets are from the same source; but if they are, it's an added bonus."
5.0,"Very cute, price is good."
5.0,Great hoody
5.0,I loved this product.  Won‚Äôt be for everyone because of material.  Not your average sweatshirt.
5.0,"I sized up on this because I wanted a loose fit but I think I could have ordered the XL and it would have been fine. This is a dress but I‚Äôm wearing it as a tunic. It‚Äôs actually pretty thick and warm. It‚Äôs well sewn with serged seams. The pockets are decent sized and can fit a cellphone. The sleeves are very long and I have to roll them up. The length is nice for either a dress or a tunic, hitting just above my knees, with 5‚Äù side slits and a bottom band. The hood is large and functional with drawstrings. The fabric is 95% cotton and 5% spandex knit so it‚Äôs stretchy. The wine color is rich and dark. It‚Äôs not see through at all.<br />I‚Äôve washed it twice on cold gentle and partially dried it on low heat then hung it to dry and it came out perfectly both times.<br />For the price this is a great dress and I recommend it."

5.0,"I was nervous purchasing without trying on first since I'm 6', but the length is right at the ankle like I wanted.  Not sheer, but can show pantyline depending on what you wear with them.  The only issue for me is that they fit perfect on legs and hips but are slide down a bit in the waist.  Will update after wearing them for a bit."

5.0,Ive been wearing this ring for two weeks now and as a bartender my hands are always in water and cleaners while working 12 hour shifts and it has yet to tarnish bend or lose any stones. I HIGHLY recommend.
5.0,"If you're a fan of the show, this is a great little knicknack."

5.0,Excelente para guardar zapatos
5.0,"According to the sizing I ordered a small. I am a 5'2&#34; female who currently weighs 95lbs. That puts me about 8lbs. underweight for my height. In American sizing I am usually a XS or an XXS. This small is closer to an XXS. The top is just a tad small, my breast nipple is only covered by about an inch and I did order additional padding to protect against my nipples vs cold water. The bottom fits nicely. It would be close to American XS. It is adjustable so I would recomend ordering by the top size. Super cute and much higher quality then I would expect at this price."
5.0,"My original thongs wore out after years of use! W luv having a new, fluffy pair again! My favorite summer bedroom slippers!"
5.0,Perfect feel I love the way it fits not too big not too small I think it feels better than the balls do.lol highly recommend guys + they are cute
5.0,These glasses work surprisingly well for keeping smoke out of your eyes when opening your grill and I use them more often for slicing onions and not having your eyes watering. These glasses feel light on your face and are very comfortable. I think I need to get more for Christmas presents.

5.0,Great sparkle fancy great for special events occasions
5.0,"My husband just returned from a 4 mile high mountain hike wearing his summer weight socks.  ""Great,"" was his comment.  My summer weight pair I have worn for almost a year, and they wear well.  I no longer purchase Smart Wool socks because they wore out quickly, so I was hesitant about wear quality of these wool blend socks.  So far, excellent.  No pilling either.  They are my first choice from my drawer for their ease in putting on my feet.  Also, the socks do not develop odor as quickly as my Darn Tough socks.  I am a Mammoth Wool fan."
5.0,my granddaughter love them
5.0,Nice crossbody bag! Just what I looking for to take into the football stadium!
5.0,"A bit shorter than expected. High quality, nice looking."
5.0,"I purchased a Timex solar scout (in all matte black) for less than $50 as a beater watch. This watch was intended to be my guilt free rough-user, my incognito watch in those sketchy places, the watch that wouldn't be noticed from a distance, but would be appreciated close up.<br />Of course it came with a garbage, poorly matched strap at that price point, that's expected. I changed the band to one that totally outclassed it and made things weird (it also had an inappropriate aggressive taper and was too short). Then I got this band, the black+blue with green line down the middle.<br />Magic! Unlike typical Nato's/ Zulu's, the 'tread' of the fabric isn't horizontal; it's diagonal, it alternates between black and dark blue. The combination of these factors took my watch several notches up. Gone was it's excessive simplicity and in came dynamic color. Additionally, the green stripe made the green of the lumed numbers come alive way more than I expected. I doubt that my watch could have pulled off the Nato tail tuck, but this Zulu (single pass) just folded back into the 1st keeper nicely. It seems well made, it's comfortable, it allows me to tighten as much as I feel appropriate and stays very low profile and it still looks understated from a distance and shines when observed more closely. I will tell you again when I get another variation of this great strap."
5.0,"My husband died recently and he was from PR, so I wanted lanyards and since this is a 2-pack, I can use one for each of our vehicles. Durable and shipped quickly."

5.0,It‚Äôs too large for my 13 year old son but fits an adult.
5.0,"Nice hat, fits the quality I would expect a product with Callaway's name on it to have. Made of a nice high quality breathable fabric with solid construction. Don't mind being a walking advertisement too much. I just tell myself they're my sponsor ;)"
5.0,great jacket..hard to find in USA..Thank You
5.0,This hat is awesome!  Thanks
5.0,"I am a style blogger and have worked with this company numerous times and I must say, Sojos has done it again! If you are looking for inexpensesive, show stopping sunglasses these are it. I love the silver frame that fit snug on the bridge of my nose. They are lightweight and seem to be durable.<br /><br />The lenses are mirrored but at some angles you can see your eyes based off where the sun is located. The frames are oversized and give off such a movie star vibe & who doesn't want that! I received numerous compliments when I wore them. They‚Äôre not for everyone, but they are most certainly for someone!<br /><br />They come in a variety of fun colors and are so classy. I have multiple pair and they are all so different yet durable and well made! They are comfortable to wear and provide great protection from the sun!<br /><br />They deliver them in perfect condition, nice packaging & an overall clean look. I had no challenges with my order and they were shipped quickly and on time. You don't want to miss out on these unique pair of sunglasses! I recommend these and any other style!"
5.0,Great leather strap.. will look even better as I break it in more
5.0,Perfect size for a 5 year old and was delivered quickly. I have a happy Jason
5.0,Very comfortable and supports the belly. Love the fit.
5.0,"Muy bonita la blusa , el color muy lindo , me gusta est√° marca Land end , muy buena calidad , tengo algunas prendas de esta marca, primera vez la compro por aqu√≠ por Amazon est√° marca , porque siempre e comprado directamente a la compa√±√≠a , vale la pena los precios , recomiendo estas  blusas ."

5.0,Love these! Wear them often!
5.0,Perfect guy mask.
5.0,"Good watch for the money.  Minute hand does work, but that is not important to me."
5.0,"My girlfriend loves these, really grippy bottoms and warm. Plus they've been washed a couple of times and seem to hold up nicely."
5.0,I'm loving it and adding to my collection
5.0,Lightweight and looks like it'll work.
5.0,"I love this wallet.  Best used by itself and not to go into a purse.  Does not work well in openings of most purses.  But for using it by itself, it is great.  Losts of card sleeves and places for other items.  Cell phone fits in also."
5.0,THis ring was a gift for my Taino native american friend.  She loved it.  and it didn't need to be sized.  Thankyou for sending quickly.
5.0,"I love to put a smile in my little angels, and these sandals sure do the trick. They are super cute and the price is just right"
5.0,Super cute and the friend I got it for loved it. Really soft fabric.
5.0,Rather than a one or two line description of my medical issues worn on a separate band I have my complete medical and prescription history right on my watchband accessed by one camera click on the QR code.  And if any info changes I simply add/edit on my free account page.  Brilliant!
5.0,I looovveee this shirt! My fianc√© bought it as a gift and it‚Äôs so cute and super comfortable! Size medium fits perfectly! Great fabric! Now I want one in every color!
5.0,Love the size and color!!!
5.0,Memorable and useful gift for a graduate
5.0,"These suspenders are well made, comfortable and a great value. Recommend them without hesitation."
5.0,These are great and my kids (7 and 5) love them.  The draw string is so simple but because it‚Äôs elastic it has some give allowing movement but staying in place.  Soft fabric but once the kids get playing it‚Äôs almost too warm.  These are of good quality construction with decent fabric and hold up well to repeated washing and drying.
5.0,"Great indoor slippers. Fit as expected, light weight and good quality.  Will definitely order again"
5.0,Soft and washes well!
5.0,Bougth for my daughter. She wants to live in this dress. Fit was perfect especially in the chest area. (She is very well endowed) Only suggestion is make sure you get a slip because it is white and in direct sunlight can be a little see through.
5.0,Fast delivery. As expected for the price.
5.0,Love them and cant beat the price!
5.0,I had the sleeves sewn down and the slit because this was for a Church event. Received compliments all night.
5.0,Like the glasses. Use for work daily.
5.0,"Very good, comfortable glasses.  I wear them when I am driving or riding my bicycle."
5.0,Fast shipping. Exactly what I expected
5.0,Beautiful bag. I prefer a smaller bag as I am old. &#34;)
5.0,Very comfortable and able to wear all day.
5.0,"We noticed a posture improvement within a week of wearing this shirt. He says it's uncomfortable to slouch when wearing it. Even when he doesn't have it on, his posture has improved dramatically. He wears it 5 days a week. He's also stopped complaining of sore upper back muscles (probably from less slouching). Not everyone will have the same results but it has worked very well for our son."
5.0,Perfect... my daughter looked absolutely amazing in it. Very full and fluffy
5.0,"I just love these dresses! I have 5 of them. For reference I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 180 lbs, and an XL is perfect! It is fitted on top then flairs. It hits about 2 to 3 in above my knees. Washed up well-I machine wash in cool water but hang to dry. The material is soft as butter. I highly recommend-super comfy and cute!"
5.0,Easy to use. Very comfortable. Came with filters.
5.0,"Big fan of compression sleeves, and my SLS3s are easily my favorite pair - so much so that I bought a second in another color!  I find that compression socks, which fully fit the feet as well, are too tight around the arches of my wide feet, so the sleeves provide perfect compression on my calves only.  I use my sleeves for recovery only, as I find running with the compression a little difficult, but post-long run there's no better way to increase circulation for healing and recovery than properly fitted compression sleeves!  Plus, the butterflies and beautiful color selections make these sleeves some of the most attractive without being overblown with design that gets too stretched out over muscles.  A great combination of form and function, and a must-have for endurance athletes."
5.0,Excellent cap. It is according to the one shown.
5.0,"I ordered a Medium as I am a solid Medium top wearer... This top is a bit big, even after washing a drying, but I am not complaining.  The flowy nature of the top is perfect for a hot day and looks great with white jeans or light-weight Capri's"
5.0,Anne kleinSport are nice for walk there confort
5.0,Product just as expected and received very promptly.
5.0,Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves them!
5.0,Very cute.  My great-granddaughter has not worn them yet.
5.0,"cute, simple, v well made."
5.0,I bought this to wear with a purple dress just to cover the elastic part and it's perfect.  Looks very pretty on.
5.0,"Great necklace! Beautiful. I've gotten tons of compliments. It comes in a small black pouch to protect it in transit. It's sturdy, but lightweight."
5.0,"This is lovely! The fabric is not thin like most organic cotton items out there, just right...but so inexpensive! It's very flattering to a short, curvy gal like myself. I will probably need to wear some short heels with it. I'm so glad I gave it a try and bought it!"
5.0,I loved how soft this sweater is! It‚Äôs cute fun!<br />It came with a crease in it a wrinkle but it won‚Äôt come out even after washing :( but I‚Äôm still wearing it it‚Äôs so cute
5.0,It was good comfortable
5.0,This is not for warmth only as a decorative accessory. Its gorgeous and perfect accent for my outfit.
5.0,This is a cute set. Adds color to my kitchen
5.0,"I honestly thought I was getting a soft, crushable wool hat, like the Stetson crushable version that sells for a ridiculous $130. But instead, it's a firm-felt cowboy hat at a price point at one-third the entry-level Stetson. No leather sweatband, and no lining. No hat box, but good packaging. Most of the product description is stolen from Stetson. I'm a 7 1/8 and the small size started out too big but snugged up nicely. Overall a great value on a decent quality hat that looks just like a Stetson!"
5.0,Just like the description. Fits as expected. Love the lining!
5.0,Super fast shipping! just like the picture! super comfy too!
5.0,beautiful stone!
5.0,Fit nicely. Bring 5 feet tall it's hard to find capris that guy like capris. These are perfect. So comfy I wife them to bed. I also have these in gray. I love them.
5.0,"Product as advertised, it's a mask. Items were individually wrapped. There is a slight smell to the masks, so just let them air out for a bit. I am writing this review upon receipt of the product so I have not washed them yet. However, while the print is nice and is as pictured in the listing, I would not call the Great quality, I would call them Good quality; and I personally will hand wash them and opposed to tossing them in the washing machine with the rest of the laundry. Also the filter placement in the mask helps to flatten the appearance of the mask, making the image printed on the mask look even better. With or without the filter there is a slight gap under my chin, but that could just be due to the shape of my face and the straps needing to be tightened, no big deal. Okay for daily wear, and its a cool novelty item just what I wanted for for Darth Vader cosplay."
5.0,Perfect!! I usually wear a l/xl and ordered a 3x.
5.0,Loved it! Just as described and perfect for my sons wedding!
5.0,best cotton house dress ever
5.0,"Great value, great slippers"
5.0,"These are comfortable and well sized, I included photos. I'm a size 8 foot"
5.0,"I bought the dragonfly necklace, super cute and the material is good. I wouldn't wear it on a rainy day or get it wet or else it'll smell like metal for a while. Really great for the price though."
5.0,school play
5.0,"Nice for the price, but I thing the 7mm Stud is a little too big for my second piercing.  The earrings are very pretty and they look exactly like the picture."
5.0,Decent made cotton shirt.  Unique for sure.  Great gift for a Bengals fan who can‚Äôt stand the St _ _ l _ rs
5.0,My daughter loved it! Makes a great gift
5.0,My son loved the texture and the colors
5.0,"Love it, very comfortable"
5.0,"Super cute, well made."
5.0,"I got this for my niece's birthday and she LOVED it. She is 5'11 and I got the larger size based on the sizing chart and it fit her perfect. But keep in mind, she wears her pants very low so that probably plays a big part in why they fit her. She loves to lounge and go to the store in them...she'd stay in them all of the time if she could get away with it."
5.0,"Bought this on a whim and - wow - do I love this bag! I get so many compliments on it and people are always surprised I got it on amazon! I love that it stands up on its own and I love that the strap is adjustable! It's got a great texture and the divided pockets are nice to help keep me...somewhat organized! My only issue is that the buttons on the sides that are intended to pinch/shrink the bag will not stay buttoned, but that's not a deal breaker for me at all."
5.0,Loved the jacket and customer service was great. I had bought a large for my son and it fit at the waist and he wanted it to fit a little longer so went up a size. Had no problems with exchange
5.0,"I tell my granddaughter this all the time ,now she will have me with her all the time I love it."
5.0,MU cool
5.0,Seemed snug at first but within minutes warmed up and looked fantastic. Second day I actually pulled the drawstring but they still looked great. Third day they were baggy and stretched out but I anticipated that and I still loved them.  I'm ordering another pair! WRT Length: I'm 5'9&#34; and wear a &#34;tall&#34; or &#34;long&#34; in most brands. These are a little too long for flat shoes but I think the regular length may be too short for anything besides very flat shoes so I'm sticking with longs. Not a deal breaker either way; just an observation from someone in that middle range of the height to pant-length issue.
5.0,I have been wearing this brand and size of socks for many years. Fine quality. Very comfortable. Very good durability. In Hawaii nobody wears shoes in the house. We run around in socks.  Durability is essential.  I have nothing but kind things to say about this product. - Hawaii Guy
5.0,The high waste is awesome it‚Äôs double material so makes the tummy look flat. The material has held up well and they are not see through once u have them on as many others I have tried.
5.0,Purchased these so I could hang my mask around my neck when outside and wouldn't have to rummage through my pockets as I enter buildings. They work great. The little rubber grommet is great for adjusting the length of chain available. Colors are vibrant and nice to look at. No fraying or other wear and tear visible after several months of daily use. Would recommend.
5.0,Beautiful abalone shell pendant. Very nice.
5.0,Adult size but my kids loved them.
5.0,This necklace was every bit as nice as was advertised. My daughter was the recipient of this gift and loved it.
5.0,I love love love this umbrella it's so beautiful and works perfect
5.0,"I love this bag, it has a lot of space.  The shoe compartment is big enough to fit to pairs of womens shoes."
5.0,Love love love this brand!  I only recently discovered them and I‚Äôve ordered so many tops already.  So flattering!  Never thought I‚Äôd feel comfortable wearing a belt or any top with a defined waist but they‚Äôre great!  I feel like I‚Äôm skinny (almost) and chic!
5.0,"I was right on the edge for size, a medium and large. I am 5‚Äô4 and 140#. So I ordered a large in this color and a medium in another color. They both fit. The large are a little too big. But that‚Äôs ok. Because I can fit my winter leggings under the large. They are extremely comfortable and nice and stretchy."
5.0,"I am 250lbs and 5'4. I am curvy and my weight is distributed mostly in my hips, thighs and arms. I was worried after I read a review with a similar body type and that person didn't like this dress. For me, I REALLY like this dress. Here's why: I get the coverage I need in my arms and the dress is not clingy. I ordered XL by the way. I agree that the pockets sit in a weird location so if you are not long and lean, this is an issue because it draws attention to the area. For us gals with major hip action, I used the pockets to my advantage because at 5'4, I don't love the length. I used the pockets to help me create volume in the middle of the dress to further camouflage my butt and hips. I used a large safety pin to gather the material on the sides (gathered underneath the dress, of course). This served two purposes...I was able to raise the length to my ankle or calf AND the gathers helped create an illusion on my midsection/hip area. I really love that this dress is versatile, perfect material weight for Spring, Summer or Fall in my opinion (I live in Virginia). For the price, the experiment worked out for me. Pair with a bold necklace and good to go!"
5.0,These pants exceeded my expectations. I wanted something comfortable for lounging and these were perfect. They're soft on the inside and very stretchy.
5.0,size M for size 2 shoe
5.0,"Cute, comfortable top."
5.0,light wieght you can breath and fashionable
5.0,came as described...no issues
5.0,"These leggings are amazing! I bought one in black, blue, great and burgundy. Absolutely the best leggings i ever had for this price. Quality, stretch and fit are top. They really improve you're look"
5.0,Very nice item.
5.0,"Love it! I usually wear M and ordered M. Fits just right. Looks very nice, highly recommend"
5.0,My kid is a Yankees fan. He likes Aaron judge. And he likes wearing uniforms. What more can I say? This does the job perfectly.
5.0,I have pretty much all styles of the csb sierra crop and the quality is practically the same! Sooo soft and comfyy and tbh i think it is better. It hold the girls in a bit better
5.0,Super comfy and great quality. My go to nightie. Love the pockets and washes well in hot water and normal heat dryer
5.0,love this wallet! it's super small and cute and is great quality.<br />Considering the price- this is a GREAT buy.<br /><br />I love how I can easily find any cards due to the multiple card holders..<br />I carry ALL my cards/ID/some cash and coupons and it honestly doesn't even feel that full.<br /><br />LOVE IT and would buy again.

5.0,Love my sandals have gotten so many compliments
5.0,Beautiful....love how it fits...all 3
5.0,These suspenders are great!
5.0,Love this thing. Needed a stadium bag for an Ed Sheeran show. Somehow stumbled on this one. Knew it was a Knock off of an Herm√®s bag.  The loose translation of the garbled ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù words amuses me.<br />And I cannot believe how many compliments I got. So cute I rotate it in for every day use and someone stops me every time I use it to comment on how cute it is. So far it‚Äôs been durable. One time I looped the strap through the belt loops on my jeans and wore it as a ‚Äúfanny pack.‚Äù  Hands free and still cute.
5.0,Fast delivery. Fits perfect! Thank you
5.0,"Damn, these smell good!<br />Quality is fantastic, but in my size 13 - they are NOT really a ""stretcher"" but more of a ""shaper"" for my expensive shoes - which is also massively important! I recommend this as a ""stretcher"" for smaller sized shoes - or in my case as a ""shaper""!!! I will buy more of these for sure!!!"
5.0,just whatI was looking for works good an don't even fill in my pocket
5.0,Finally some manly readers! Of course women could rock them too. These readers fit well and are very clear. I would recommend to anyone.
5.0,THEY FIT AND LOOKED GREAT ON MY WIFE. SHE LOVED THEM WILL BUY MORE COLORS. NICE SEXY PANTY.
5.0,"This dress fits perfect. I love the material of the dress. I was so excited when I got,and even more excited when I tried it on. Very pleased, I ordered my sister on. I will be placing future orders with this company.<br />Can't wait to wear it."
5.0,"If you have a bust over DD, go L or XL.<br /><br />I wish there were more colors and sizes available. I'd buy several more.<br /><br />The fit is extremely flattering, and the color is a perfect muted grey. The mock neck is nice and close fitted without being tight.<br /><br />Truly lovely."
5.0,"My Wife Absolutly loved these Gloves for Christmas 2018 .  Great Quality Product , highly recommend them üëçüëç"
5.0,"I love this shirt! I usually wear an XL and this fits perfectly. The cut is very flattering. It hangs nicely. I meant to not put it in the dryer, but as usual, I forgot and put it in the dryer. There was no shrinkage and it came out beautiful and wrinkle free. I will be ordering more in different colors!"
5.0,I was unsure of which size to purchase due to the mixed reviews that were provided. I'm 132 pounds and 5ft6&#34; And I ordered a small. It fits a bit bigger than expected and I had a minor alteration done on the dress. The material is of good quality and it's a cute little versatile black dress to have in your closet.
5.0,"Awesome jacket, but the size chart sucks!"
5.0,Good quality.  Buy it if you need it.
5.0,Gorgeous necklace.  The colors are not as vibrant as the picture.

5.0,I get compliments on my jacket often
5.0,Love them! The fox and pearl are perfect for me. Seems to be pretty good quality for the price.
5.0,"Just got it and seems to be well made, everything locks up tight and swivels smoothly"
5.0,"I love these because they have the little stickies on the fingers and palms for a good grip.  The Thinsulate inside the gloves are super soft, and don't itch from the wool contact - SO THAT IS GREAT."
5.0,Stunning stones and great energy. By far one of my favorites
5.0,Really soft and pretty! Nice with a pencil skirt or some slacks for work
5.0,Nice looking and sturdy!!!
5.0,"I love it, it‚Äôs perfect. Exactly how it shows on here"
5.0,Excellent very cute
5.0,Solid gloves for the price

5.0,Perfect for day use or leaving in all the time.  Very comfortable!
5.0,"I was very surprised by the amount of fabric for the price.  The zebra print scarf was smaller than the Leopard, however both drape fantastically. The fabric was soft to the touch and looks great on.  I will shop with niceEshop again."
5.0,"My grandson loved this jacket. Very nicely made. True to size. Washed and dried a few times, still like new!"
5.0,butiful
5.0,I purchased these for my 5 year old daughter and they are the perfect size for her tiny ears. I love the quality and I have paid double before for 1 pair that didn't last at all. I will be buying the larger size for myself SOON!
5.0,INSTEAD OF SENDING A BIRTHDAY CARD TO WISH MY NEW DAUGHTER IN LAW I SENT HER THIS KEY RING TO SHOW HER HOW MUCH SHE WAS CARED FOR BY ME.  SHE REALLY LOVED IT AND WAS HAPPY.  DEFINITELY BETTER THAN A CARD WHICH WOULD BE EVENTUALLY THROWN OUT; THIS WILL LAST A WHILE LONGER. HAPPY WITH PRODUCT.
5.0,I was very pleased when I opened the package!  Nicer in hand  than what is pictured.  Arrived quickly!
5.0,This dress is ABSOLUTELY beautiful and so EXTREMELY comfortable I could wear it everyday. The fabric used to make this dress is ULTRA soft and slightly stretchy so the fit is perfect. I can wear it for the everyday occasion or I can dress it up with a couple pieces of jewelry and heels for a gorgeous date night outfit. And the price is definitely affordable. I just can say enough positive things about this dress. This is probably the best online clothing item I've ever purchased.
5.0,A little long because I‚Äôm short but I love the dress thank you
5.0,Fits true that size. Very flattering for curves.
5.0,"The best part here may be how attractive this watch is, while watches are not as popular with the advent of cell phones, this looks like an expensive one, and is great for the basic time keeping if you don't have your phone handy, or take the time to turn it on.  This gold, brown face, and leather band it an elegant combo that makes this look like it cost ten times the price.  I use some smart watches to monitor sports or health, but when I go out or on the job, this would be my first choice.<br /><br />Decent looking crystal, could use a magnifier on the date, but other than that fine.  Water resistant, but not for swimming or bathing.  Standard belt style leather band is attractive and more comfortable than most metal bands.  A little more trouble when removing than snap open types, but sometimes those open when you don't want them too.  Hands and around the dial marks are luminous, but only for a short time after about five minutes in the absents of light, you can't read the face in the dark anymore.  You need to stick your ear close to hear the tick tick tick of the movement, so very quiet.  Recommended."
5.0,"These bras are so comfy. I usually wear a 42 D, but I can wear a 42 C with this bra. I am not bulging out on the top, and it seems to minimize a bit. The wires can poke somewhat under the chubby part of the arms, but it is not bad. Very smooth look."
5.0,This sports bra fits perfect and is more comfortable to wear that regular bras. Full coverage and support without wire.
5.0,Worked out perfect with my outfit
5.0,As always great dress from Homeyee.
5.0,It fits perfect and the material is very comfortable. The crop ends at the perfect spot
5.0,I love these pants I got medium. I was afraid they might be to small because after ordering I noticed someone remarked they usually wear a medium but ordered a large. Good construction great fabric!
5.0,Excellent product!  I'll definitely buy from this seller again!
5.0,I love it! It‚Äôs better than I expected.
5.0,"Shirt is great !! Very comfortable , I‚Äôll be buying more !!"
5.0,"These shorts are super comfy, my wife loves them and they are super super soft. They are good for going out or just chilling at the house"
5.0,"They look great, so far so good"
5.0,I have high blood pressure so these because the perfect socks to wear to help with the swelling! I love these socks!!
5.0,"My very young son recently developed a fascination with monster trucks and necklaces, and this was the best of both worlds. The necklace is high quality and the perfect size for a toddler. It has held up well thus far, and I highly recommend this product!"
5.0,"ITS FITS!!! Ok I was skeptical about buying this dress , actually any dress from Amazon really but after I read the reviews I felt more confident. I got home tried on the dress and im glad i bought IT. I have big bust, im 5'4 not skinny about 190 pounds. I got a 2XL. It passes my knee. The sleeve fit a little snug,  the bust area is a little snug too but overall it fits especially in the waist. The material is nice. The should area is a little wide I guess its because of the lace so my bra strap actually shows. I guess I just have to wear a strap less bra. I like that its a wrinkle free dress. I bought this dress 5 days before my mother's formal surprise birthday party and after discovering the dress I had in the closet doesn't fit anymore so I turned to Amazon . It arrived 2 days before the ü•≥ üéä üéâ PARTY! YAAYY"
5.0,"These knee highs are great, silky smooth,reinforced foot area, and fit is comfortable, will definetly order more!"
5.0,Beautiful earrings that were bought to match a ring. Good quality and appearance!
5.0,"Nice scarfUnfortunately, I am returning it because it arrives late. Fortunately I ordered a couple of other scarves that arrived on time before Christmas."
5.0,It fits more cards than I expected.
5.0,The earring holder works great and it is so nice to have earring all in order and easy to find.
5.0,Mi hija est√° feliz con su vestido lo compre para su cumplea√±os y me encant√≥ el material la verdad super√≥ mis expectativas. Super recomendado
5.0,"These are just as expected, cute little mask holders. They clip on and adjust easily, there are fun colors for kiddos (and neutral colors for adults), the material doesn‚Äôt aggravate the skin, and they stay put well. You get a lot of lanyards for the price, and the different colors are great. Little things like this help to encourage people to wear masks and they are less likely to lose said mask with the lanyard. I‚Äôm really glad I got these, they are great to have, and give to friends and family."
5.0,just what she wanted
5.0,Chillin straight urkel
5.0,So pretty and comfortable!  I was afraid the off the shoulder style would feel like it was slipping down but it feels secure.  The material is slightly stretchy so it moves well with you and the invisible zipper is expertly sewn!
5.0,"This is actually my third purchase of this hat (because I keep forgetting them places).  It is perfectly slouchy without making you look like a total hobo.  I also have a bigger head and finding a good winter hat that doesn't make me look like a total goofball is a real challenge.  This hat is super warm, good quality, good fit and it looks very nice with anything I wear with it."
5.0,I love this belt!  The buckle goes so well with the patent leather belt. Beautiful!
5.0,"Fit is perfect, very nice fabric, thick enough.  Very comfortable."
5.0,"I got this to see if I would I would like a septum piercing...or a lip piercing. It was exactly as advertised. I actually really like the look of the septum piercing. I just wouldn't get it permanently.<br /><br />Overall,,, it was worth it."
5.0,"The pictures really do not do it justice, it is more beautiful in person! Bought 2 scarves and my husband loves them both. John Hanly makes wonderful hats and scarves!"
5.0,"I love the look of this band! It‚Äôs very trendy, but more importantly comfortable. This is elastic and so soft. I don‚Äôt have to worry about rashes forming from this one. Great purchase and fits perfectly."
5.0,I love these sunglasses - fit perfect - so light weight you do not even know they are on - and very stylish to look at!!!
5.0,"I am very happy with this dress.  I ordered an XL, which fits snugly but has some breathing room.  At first I could not find the side zipper, but I did find it - is it very small and located under the left arm.  I was able to get the dress on without opening it (not knowing it was there), but now that I found it I find it is much easier to get on and off.  This dress was a bargain, which makes it even more appealing to me!  The red lace is &#34;see through&#34; but there is a dark blue &#34;under dress&#34; layer beneath it.  I may order a petticoat to wear under it.  If I do, I'll post more pictures.  I hope this helps.  Cheers!"
5.0,I really love this bracelet. Its dainty and cute. Will make a great graduation gift.
5.0,Great for kids backpacks.
5.0,"Great product, they keep my legs from hurting and I even have more energy now!"
5.0,I bought them for my grand daughter and she loves them. She says they are very soft and comfortable.
5.0,"Came earlier than expected, fit very well, nice material. Very happy with this product.Will buy again in another color."
5.0,Beautiful and light material.  My daughter is very special with clothes abd she loves this dress.  I recommend it
5.0,"Beautiful top, well made and looks expensive.  Great quality. Only issue is that is runs two sizes too small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 105 pounds and the size small was too small on me so I exchanged for medium."
5.0,"I first saw this shirt at Kohl‚Äôs.<br />I checked at other Kohl‚Äôs but couldn‚Äôt fin one in my size, even to order.<br />I finally found one on Amazon and I do like the shirt."
5.0,Great dress! Great material and fits true to size!
5.0,Everything is as advertised. 100 % cotton. Washed several times according to instruction on the shirt and did not fade and print stayed sharp as first received. Happy with purchase. Going to purchase another one from them with different design.
5.0,My favorite animal.  The shirt is so cozy and warm.  I love the print.
5.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for. I know it's a simple J pin, but it's what its going to stand for.. as a memoriam to my cousin Jonathan who left us too soon"
5.0,Loved it. i had to get two sizes too big for it to fit right but that was fine. I'm in love.
5.0,An affordable assortment of nose rings.<br /><br />I pulled my nose stud out moths ago and have been getting by with a simple ring. I picked these because I wanted multiple backups (in case I pull it out again) as well as different gem/ball size options. They fit great and were a really great deal for the price.
5.0,very cute dress
5.0,so far does it's purpose looks nice on a dress shirt
5.0,Bracelets are as described and the color is on point to wear when the Kansas City Chiefs are playing!
5.0,"I love these glasses ! The wood on the sides is really good quality, and the vision though the lenses is really clear and bright , orange hue ! Love them, they are perfect and fit my face just right !"
5.0,I like this passport wallet. I have been using it since July and it has held up pretty well.  Any criticism I could give would just be unreasonable given the low price.
5.0,Excellent for any and all cold weather activities where super insulated bulky gloves aren‚Äôt needed.
5.0,We ordered this for our wedding and my husband LOVED it! Great quality!
5.0,I came home with winnings!!!
5.0,"These pants are really soft and comfortable.  I love that the cuffs just below your knee aren't loose, but they aren't too tight either, so they don't leave an impression on your skin."
5.0,I love it. I've received compliments each time I've worn it. The hook part of the clasp does grab some things (sweater and scarf I was wearing) but it just means I'm more aware when I wear the bracelet.
5.0,This bracelet is really a great quality item.  I have had it for months now and it is just like new!  I receive lots of positive comments on it just because it is an attractive piece.  Then folks realize it is a Medical ID bracelet.  A couple of friends have purchased the same item after seeing this one up close.  Great Product!
5.0,"Bought this for my mother- she loved it. For the price it was actually great quality, better than I had expected"
5.0,Incredible boot. Only thing that could make it better would be water proof and hooks in the top three laces would be great.
5.0,bought for a gift its beautiful
5.0,They are far better that I was expecting for the price
5.0,This shirt is just as advertised! Perfect fit and great for my workouts!
5.0,"Perfect fit, they stay up, and has phone pockets on both legs!"
5.0,"Excellent 3 CD package. Quality is new. No problems with playing. Only bad point: on the third disc appear 10 tracks. As the package says, this third cd has been previously released as Voice of the Celtic Heart. But that cd contains 11 tracks! Missing is the song Sial A Ran."""
5.0,They fit perfectly and very comfortable.  Have used them a lot.  Even used them for swimming.  I love my country!
5.0,Muy lindos y variados
5.0,Bought here to add to my collection of reading glasses but are now the only pair I wear. Ordered a second pair in black. Very impressed with the quality for the price.
5.0,"Me agrado, para uso propio, lo voy a recomendar, bello producto"
5.0,"Extremely satisfied  wonderful product received a nice letter that came with it, MO Johnson  himself the retired miltary man very nice  he took the time to include a short story about himself.<br />You won't be sorry ordering this product"
5.0,Pretty and elegant .... make feel the night start
5.0,I loved it was very comfy but a little big
5.0,It‚Äôs so simple and beautiful
5.0,Well my kid likes them. Keeps his hair down.
5.0,"Its a cute hat, but u didn't rwlize from the picture shown how thin the hat is or how lose the knitting is"
5.0,It fit as expected and I received a lot of compliments!
5.0,"After reading some negative reviews about sizing and fit, I braced myself for disappointment. It had happened to me too, on different orders. However, after trying on this sweater, I was absolutely amazed at the tailored fit and luxurious feel. It's my new favorite!<br />Another great feature is the zipper. It seems robust and smooth. This is extremely important to me right now, with an injured hand and restricted dexterity."
5.0,"Bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He really liked it.  The graphics are great, but the shirt material is thin for the price.  I hope it washes well."
5.0,It's a luggage tag with a plastic protector for the name card and a privacy flap.
5.0,My wife is from Switzerland and ordered this for an Oktoberfest here in Texas last minute and it arrived in perfect time! The material is real leather and she is super satisfied with it! She will definitely be using these for every Oktoberfest we go to! Thanks!
5.0,I ordered these for both of my nieces. They absolutely Love them. Great price and great variety. My niece said she Loves each one!!Ankle
5.0,Figure flattering even on a small frame.  My husband actually prefers this one piece over my bikinis.  Love it.
5.0,"I love these! These were recommended to me after I had a c-section and could not find any sort of underwear that the band didn‚Äôt either roll into my incision and tug at the incision or were comfortable. I loved these so much that I bought three packs of them! They go above my post pregnancy pooch, don‚Äôt roll down, and are very comfortable!"
5.0,My brother loves it. He says he gets a lot of laughs and compliments.
5.0,Nice and comfy. A must
5.0,"I really love this shirt. It is beautiful and looks good. I'm very into comfort and this is super comfortable. I am happy that I bought this shirt. Sized correctly, fast shipping and wonderful brand that I have fallen in love with. I will be buying again. Thanks"
5.0,Fits my daughter like its supposed to love it
5.0,"Very comfortable, fits well with my wardrobe. Wears well with jeans and dresses. Easy to pack, lightweight, good for transitioning seasons."
5.0,"Soy Talla M, pero pedi un L<br />Me quedo perfecto"
5.0,Probably my favorite dress.
5.0,"Simply perfect! My son loved it, did not want to take it off since it arrived."
5.0,So cute!  Worked perfect for a Cruella Disneybound.
5.0,"They look exactly like the photo, and fit as if they were made specifically for me! As they look wonderful with my prom dress, I'd highly recommend."
5.0,"I ordered this shirt in small and it fits very snugly.  It is a compression shirt though so that‚Äôs not necessarily bad.  I usually wear a size 4 in pants and dresses.  One thing that I really like about the shirt is that the sleeves are very long.  I have very long arms and rarely find sleeves that are long enough, but these are actually longer than need be so that they can even cover part of my hands.  If you have short arms though, these might be annoying for you.<br /><br />The material is quite thick and warm but not hot.  The overall construction seems better than I thought it would be.  I haven‚Äôt warn it for long enough to know for sure, but it seems like a high quality garment with good tight stitching.<br /><br />Depending on weather and your activity, you could wear this by itself to stay cooler or under other clothing to be warmer.  The material in the armpit area is thinner to keep you cool and dry.<br /><br />I received this compression shirt for free in exchange for my honest review. I do not let the fact that I receive a discount on a product keep me from pointing out any negative aspects."
5.0,Love it! Got here fast!
5.0,As described. The visual effect works as intended from on stage. Good quality hat. My head is a 7 and 3/4 so i expected a slightly tight fit. But it stays on even when moving on stage. Shipped fast.
5.0,Love this. Got a lot of compliments.
5.0,"Beautifully made, light weight watch! I have gotten at least a dozen compliments on it within 24 hours of wearing the watch. Do note though, to change the battery in this watch you will need a very small Philips head screw driver."
5.0,This watch is very nice for the price. I have got a lot of compliments on it. It is definitely a big face watch. Do not get it if you are not into big watches. I love it.
5.0,"The spring bars are excellent and fit perfectly on my Rolex, unlike the rest of the junk that is out there."
5.0,Excellent product! Quick shipping too. Just love Tommie Copper gloves.
5.0,"Arrive small, But when you open it it opens to this beautiful hat. Holds up to any situation you need. It is very beautiful."
5.0,Love these sunglasses.
5.0,Bought it my dog with an injured feet. It's gentle on his feet
5.0,"This makeup organizer was easy to assemble, rotates with ease, and the rubber rings helped keep the trays in place so you can lift the top of the organizer if you need to move it and it won‚Äôt fall apart.<br /><br />I like being able to arrange the shelves according to preference and usage and it helps to accommodate the height of certain perfume bottles and makeup. The lipstick holders are very roomy and can fit Benefit lip tints and highlighters. I keep my skincare in a cosmetics fridge so I like using this makeup organizer to store makeup, nail polish, hair clips, and perfume."
5.0,Esactamente como lo esperaba
5.0,Absolutely spectacular!!!  Amazing quality and exquisite finish.  Beautiful packaging to keep the stones lustrous and safe!
5.0,This dress is adorable! My daughter loves it! Fits true to size.
5.0,"Good size, I feel hippieish when I'm at the farmers market, but that's what I want."
5.0,"I love,love,love this watch it fits to my wrist and I love the color, everything in it.And it delivers very early though I am happy with it.<br />I wear it everyday and I got a lot of compliments from my Lady boss she likes it<br />She wants one for her too."
5.0,this dress is sooo cute.  fun and flirty  i am 5ft 5 and weigh 135 32 C bust.  Medium fit great!
5.0,"This dress is great! Very well made and comfy. I love the deep pockets. The dress is flattering. I highly recommend. I am 5'1"" 178 lbs and the dress like great. Go ahead and buy it!"
5.0,"I have had this wallet for months now and still have no frays, broken pieces or looseness with it. It was very well made and worth the price. Color is only slightly darker than pictured, but that could be due to computer settings."
5.0,Even more lovely in person! Very flattering fit. Wrap is not too low cut.
5.0,i love it! Its small enough and cute. I'm not big on carrying large purses so this works out great for me and great price as well.
5.0,"I was skeptical about buying this skirt because of the 2 sizes to chose from. I am about 5'8 and weigh about 165 pounds. I do however have long legs and this skirt is ROCKIN!!!!! It just covers your butt and it is very very flattering, and I am NOT skinny by any means, but it makes my curves look less flabby than they are, haha. I bought a cupless leather corset to wear with it........it's HOT!!<br />Oh, I ordered size M/L."
5.0,"I received this beautiful little nose ring from my awesome daughter for my 61st birthday. As much as I love it, I need to return it. The ball on the inside isn't large enough to secure this in my nose so it keeps falling out. This breaks my heart as I love it so much but sadly it must go back. üò≠üò≠üò≠"
5.0,Todo quedo en su lugar
5.0,"I love this necklace because it is so unique in both color and design! The material (as pictured) is a nice bronze-gold, and doesn't feel too cheap, not like it will rub off immediately. I love that the chain is a bit thicker than usual, and therefore the &quot;lobster claw&quot; closure is also quite large, making it super easy to handle - no more fumbling to undo your necklace! This would be great if (like me) you struggle with tiny, dainty jewelry clasps.<br /><br />The charm is clearly printed on the front with the adorable hedgehog design, while the back side is plain textured metal. While wearing it around for a couple of hours, I didn't notice any flipping - the weighting seems solid enough to prevent this - so the unprinted backside shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />As a bonus, the necklace came with a cute drawstring &quot;Jane Stone&quot; pouch, perfect for gifting, storing, or stashing other small jewelry items.<br /><br />My only criticism (if any) is that you cannot adjust the length of this necklace - it only has one large ring for the claw closure, no extender - but the pendant sits at a nice position anyway so this is not a major issue. (See photos for a length on me.) The hedgie does hang rather close to my cleavage, however, which is not ideal for more modest dressing styles. This necklace would probably look best with either a low-cut or high-cut neckline - &quot;in between&quot; would cause the pendant to get jumbled up with your shirt.<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I am in no way rewarded for writing a positive review; these thoughts are 100% my own and would not be any different if I had paid full price.<br /><br />As much as I love this necklace, I think I will be gifting it to my hedgehog-obsessed mum for Mother's Day :)"
5.0,Love these theyr great for when u want a longer necklace
5.0,Great find for the cost they came sjper quick
5.0,VERY effective.  Amazing what a difference this makes!  I was considering getting the larger bottle because it seemed more economical but I'm glad I got this one instead because the applicator is really easy to use.  I think trying to apply it using cotton balls or Q tips could get a little messy.  And this little bottle actually holds quite a lot of polish -- sort of hard to imagine I'll get through it any time soon....  I'm not THAT avid a polisher.
5.0,We like the sentiment.  This was a gift for a nephew visiting from Germany who rides.
5.0,This product is great for healthcare workers. They fit comfortably and do not fog up. Highly recommend.
5.0,Just received this bracelet today and it is beautiful.  Love this bracelet.
5.0,"My son loves it so much, he doesn't want to take it off!"
5.0,"This dress is a bargain! It is ‚Äòbreezy‚Äô fabric, lovely in color and design.<br />Wrap dresses are ‚Äòforgiving‚Äô to different body types. The light stretch and flared design make it easily adaptable; add an extra snap, (or safety pin!) to areas prone to gap.<br />A light t-shirt can be worn underneath for ‚Äòbustier‚Äô shapes. (I like to wear a lace t-shirt underneath).<br />The polyester fabric will not only wash and wear well but is very durable. (The enclosed photo is taken with the garment right out of the package with no added adaptations.)"
5.0,Love the length and style.  Very comfortable!
5.0,Goes with a lot.
5.0,My son is 11 months old he is a 4 w so I ordered two size up because it's a strong shoe and they last really long so I ordered two sizes up which is a size 6  and they fit fine no regrets I love them
5.0,I absolutely love this purchase. I got tons of compliments and it‚Äôs super comfy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9.
5.0,"I usually get compliments when I wear them. Love the design, color and zipper pockets. And they fit great."
5.0,"Love this necklace. It's very adorable! Love that its says Bee Happy!! If you're into kitschy things, this is for you!"
5.0,The shape.  Unfortunately it does not have a lighter shade
5.0,"This was such a surprise! I thought this would be kind of thin and cheap, but this little skirt has a really nice drape/weight to it. It moves nicely and is versatile. I ordered an extra large because less expensive clothing tends to run small, but this runs fairly true to size and I could have easily worn a large or even a medium. I wear a street size 10 and am 5'9&#34;, so this is a generous fit. I bought this to wear as a ballet skirt, but because the length is a little longer than I expected, I'll just wear this as a regular skirt. It's a great piece for any wardrobe!"
5.0,"Nice , I like that they were studs but the size was large in which you can see them ‚Äò"
5.0,Without it I would buy the wrong color clothes
5.0,"Lovey, lovely , lovely ! Made in Italy, gorgeous sunglasses!"
5.0,Very pretty doesn‚Äôt look cheap good quality for the price
5.0,"Good fit, exactly as described I was looking for lightweight and breathable summertime riding long pants and it fits the bill and having those pockets were a bonus. Pay attention to sizing charts and descriptions."
5.0,"I love the softness of this pajama set! One of the most comfy I've ever had. Pretty styling and color too. The legs do run long but since I'm 5'7"", it's not an issue for me. Anyone shorter than, say, 5'5"", might need to hem them."
5.0,excellent description good shipping time
5.0,"Great hat!  Great quality, and super fast shipping."
5.0,"This is a very fun watch!  Beautiful band with a vine and a butterfly (embroidered).  Oh, and the watch itself is clear and easy to read.  I love wearing it.  I have a thin wrist and it fits well.  A great fashion statement, for those who like more unusual style."
5.0,Quality that id hope to expect from a Brand name scarf. Recipient loved it. Made of Acrylic
5.0,Daughters in law loved it.
5.0,Excellent suit! Fits my daughter perfectly. She's very buddy and this suit providers great support. Bottoms for well too. Well made. Would definitely recommend!
5.0,Great dress for my teen daughter. Soft and it is not super short.

5.0,and that's all that matters after nights of insomnia.
5.0,It matches my new coat. Thx
5.0,Bought these for my husband . He likes the feel of compression socks but hated putting them onand off . Loves these ! He is able to have the compression and have no issue getting them on as well as off
5.0,Was very disappointed because it didn't fit around the breast area very tight but such a beautiful dress! Didn't know what to do with the head wrap either ...very difficult. Just decided not to wear it. My grandmother wants one but just not in that color so I might order her one since her breasts are smaller than mine LOL
5.0,This item was perfect for a Wednesday Addams costume! I love how the product inside the bottle glows when you activate it in the light.
5.0,It's just OK but not the best.
5.0,Love this dress so much I have 3!
5.0,"This bag is beautiful it came nicely package with an included dust bag and a large but thin tote bag too, the color is a perfect light pink shade and it does not open extremely wide which is fine for me for safety reasons, however upon close inspection the inside zipper on the inside pocket was stuck and after several tries I did get the zipper to work hopefully that will no longer be a problem and it has a cell phone pocket and another pocket beside it, all in all I LOVE THIS BAG ALOT..."
5.0,It was a little shorter than expected but very nice
5.0,Great quality product.
5.0,"Leather under the canvas, so it is comfortable against skin. Nice detail and handsome with tool type watches. Not for dress watches, obviously. Really dresses up the watch compared to the strap it came with. Would work well with Samsung Gear."

5.0,Pendant is about 1/2 inch and looks just as pictured.  Beautiful!

5.0,"We had never tried merino wool anything before, but heard what a great material it is from many.  We have some stinky feet issues here and there in our house and wanted to test this material to see if it would help.  After a couple weeks of use, we are proud to say it is helping greatly.<br /><br />We will be transitioning all members of our family over to these as the others fall apart.<br /><br />Highly recommend!  We'll never have to buy socks again!  Hip Hip ... hooray!"
5.0,Beautiful and delicate!! Don't hesitate to buy for yourself or as a gift!!

5.0,Liked product
5.0,"I LOVE IT. GOOD FABRIC,  NICE SHAPE. FITS PRETTY GOOD."

5.0,"The fabric is soft and has some stretch. A tad loose in the chest area, but I'm only a B cup. Comes a couple inches above the knee, and I'm between 5'3"" - 5'4"". This particular print has a gorgeous color combination of black and white with light orange and ivory colored flowers. This looked great with an ivory blazer that I also recently purchased (and reviewed) on Amazon. This was a comfortable enough dress to wear all day. Flattering. Wore to a job interview and felt very confident and got lots of looks."
5.0,"Las mascarillas son preciosas, el color es bello, no son blancas, sino mas bien un palo rosa.  Est√°n bell√≠simas.  Muy contenta con la compra."
5.0,Beautiful! Perfect size/compartment placement and great color. I'll likely buy another darker one for fall. Haha
5.0,"Gorgeous set. I have bought several as gifts and my friends love it, too."

5.0,Love the way it looks on and fits
5.0,I absolutely love these shoes! And they came in super quickly.
5.0,"I liked the look of this dress, but it was way too big for me.  I'm between a size 10-12 and had to return it because it was just too frumpy looking on me.  I did try a belt with it to see if that would help, but it didn't."
5.0,"It was a Christmas gift and my wife had a fit over it. The stone looked more like a blue clear stone rather than moonstone. To me, it did not look exactly like the picture, but it made absolutely no difference to my wife. I still got and ""atta boy"""

5.0,"I have gotten into fitness a lot recently.  I do a lot in the gym with weights and cardio.  I needed a pair of workout shorts that is durable and practical.  This pair of shorts is just the thing.  It was able to fit my large sized iPhone 7 plus in the inner pocket.  The side and back pockets are useful too.<br />Make sure to order one size larger than American sizes.  I am 32-34 in waist which is typically M, but I ordered L which fits snugly but well."
5.0,Lovely dress! Very soft..Fit was correct ! Colors are Light pink and navy blue ....pockets on the both sides! Will update after first wash !
5.0,"my wife really likes the charm, plus it's a quality item"
5.0,"This snowflake sterling silver necklace is beautiful. It shines majestically. The diamond stone in middle hangs so it moves around with the necklace. The outer design in silver is designed and cut to perfection. It seems and looks like a very well done piece of jewelry. The hold, the clasp, the chain are all sturdy. NOTHING cheap looking about this necklace. Although I received this at a discount for my honest review it doesn't affect the realness of what you're purchasing. It's a remarkably, beautifully made piece of jewelry that shines amazingly. I'm glad I purchased it."
5.0,Very nice on
5.0,The ratchet system is awesome as I am always between belt loop sizes! Changes my quality of life
5.0,I think it fits well
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves the sleek look and feel of the wallet, and that there is no extra bulk to it. It charges her phone fast; the tiny blue LED light at the bottom indicates it is charging. It is a well-made item, and she should have this for a long time. Shipping was fast and package arrived in excellent shape."
5.0,I love these spirals. Plastic doesn't bother me and they are well made.
5.0,well made and hard to find

5.0,Love the way it looks. Would purchase again my employees love it.
5.0,"I really like this jacket, it's really well made and nice and sturdy. Exactly what I wanted and I really appreciate the Merc London tag on the inside being that I'm an anglophile. I highly recommend this jacket!!! I bought the navy blue."
5.0,Nice style and also you can take the inner lining of the jacket out as well..
5.0,"Great product, fits very high though."
5.0,Perfect style & fit
5.0,"Got this for Easter. Tried it on and I love it. I totally wear a L top, but I sized up, and I'm glad I'm did. I'm top heavy (g) and it's still a bit stretched across the bust, however going a size larger would have been too big and too long."
5.0,"I asked for the size it was, but I was very small my niece ."
5.0,"When you hold it looking at the front of the helmet it looks off, but I feel like that makes it look more homemade, it's very strong and doesn't get caught on anything, I love it"
5.0,The real deal
5.0,"They sent me the wrong underwear, but it's a happy accident because I like these better. They just were unavailable in my size at the time I ordered. However they have arrived in my size. And they are soft in their comfortable and I will definitely be ordering more. They fit true to size for me. I am 5'5"" And my weight is approximately 155 lb."
5.0,"Got this for my 18-year-old daughter, she loves it!"
5.0,"So cute, similar to the saltwater sandals but so much more affordable. My daughter picks these shoes over other any day! She says they are comfy for her little feet. Would buy again!"
5.0,Wore for my sons graduation. Fit great 5‚Äô6 150 size medium. It was very comfortable!
5.0,Fits great. Feels great. Material is great. Weight is great.<br />I am a greater person wearing these.<br /><br />Works great for a guy with skinny to average leg size.
5.0,It's a beautiful set it looks just like the Picture.
5.0,"I am a relatively big guy, 6' 250lbs, with wide shoulders. I have extreme trouble finding tshirts that fit well.... these shirts fit me perfectly. I haven't washed it yet, so we'll see how it holds up, but it fit well out of the package. Nice length, sleeves are slightly snug, shoulder seams at the right spot. I just ordered 2 more.<br /><br />Edit... these shirts didn't last long. Became ill fitting after a couple of washes. No longer a fan."
5.0,Excellent quality.. stylish..  I love the look..very high quality for a small price.. looking fantastic..
5.0,I LOVE THIS DRESS!! It is soooooo comfortable! I am 5'4 and it reached my toes without shoes on. So it's perfect length for a short girl like myself.
5.0,"I like toe rings. I already wear a sterling silver one, and this black and silver ring is a nice addition. It stretches and it's so comfortable. I'm not even aware that I have it on. Pretty ring."
5.0,I really liked how the dress fit. Just what I expected.
5.0,I love the way it fits. Very comfortable. I get plenty of compliments. Will buy again.
5.0,Wasn‚Äôt able to find a hat that fit comfortably until I came across this one. Size 8 in store is too small but this is great
5.0,"Great fit & easy to attach. Extra length in 20 & 22mm  even for large wrist. Seiko & Casio in pic, both 42-44mm watches. Band is well made & comfortable, not as thin or soft as Archer silicone & no ""quick release"" pins. May be a bit stiff at first, but breaks in after a while."
5.0,He loved them except the were tight on his legs. He is a big man
5.0,"These sunglasses look great on.  They fit my face comfortably, and they are polarized.  The soft case protects them when I am not wearing them, and also works great to clean them.  To top it off, I was lucky enough to be selected to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion......LOVE them!!!!!!"
5.0,This outfit was super cute. It shipped fast. The dress and shoes were ran a little big but not a big deal.  The tutu was super soft. My daughter  doesn't  like headbands so she didn't wear them Leggings fit well stayed on all day. My daughter will definitely be wearing this a few more times.
5.0,LOVED THEM
5.0,I love it. Very nice.
5.0,"I am so glad I purchased these booties. I ordered my normal size which is 7.5 and they fit perfectly. They are comfortable, light weight and super cute. The perforated vegan leather is on trend too. I have received lots of compliments from my co-workers on them. I will most likely purchase more in different colors."
5.0,I intentionally but this a size larger to use a a sleepshirt. It's perfect for that. As a T-Shirt it would be terribly long. I travel frequently so this is light and easy to throw in a suitcase.
5.0,A great Christmas Present for my Granddaughter
5.0,"This is PERFECT. It's soft, it appears to be very comfortable. I bought it a month and a half before it's needed, so I took into account that my son my grow a little more, I ordered it a size up just to be safe.<br />It is SOOOO CUTE. I am VERY HAPPY!!!"
5.0,"Beautiful, got a lot of compliments!"
5.0,Pretty comfortable for wide feet too.
5.0,Super cheap and showed up exactly as described. Not much more to say.
5.0,"i cannot believe how nice this ring looks.  During the day the color looked more blue. In the evening the ring looks very green.  For the price well worth it.  Just received today, so far so good."
5.0,Looks beautiful and well made
5.0,Love this robe it‚Äôs super soft warm and cuddly.  I would love to have one in every color
5.0,It was gift . I went one size up and it was perfect! He loved it!
5.0,"Was not too sure about this wallet when it arrived. It was so small, I am use to a trifold wallet. I have been using it for 3 days now and really like it. It fits in my front pocket and it is like it is not even there.  I currently have 5 cards in the pocket, and really that is all I need. Money strap works great, way better than a money clip."
5.0,"I love hats - they don't love me.  But this one fits - looks stylish - stays on in wind. Great color, great fabric.<br />My only con - is even though I like the distressed look - there is an intentional hole/rip on visor that is almost centered and draws one's eye to it."
5.0,Fit just right and she loved the colors
5.0,very cute. Look sturdy. My daughter loves it
5.0,"Great, soft inside.  My swimmer grandson loves it!"

5.0,Good bang for the buck!
5.0,Great shoe. Wonderful support and stylish!
5.0,"These are beautiful and I'm so happy with them! I have a hard time wearing a face mask, but these are light weight and do not feel like they are suffocating me. Since wearing a mask is the new norm I wanted something nice and these are great!"
5.0,My go to shoe. I wear these all the time.
5.0,"Perfect, it came the way is show on line exactly."
5.0,I love these earrings so much. Plus I am obsessed with roses so it was perfect. No damage to the package
5.0,The fit was perfect has some stretch to it and the material is thick so it was perfect for winter
5.0,"Great design, finishing and manufacturing"
5.0,It's perfect! Exactly as pictured and more than I was expecting.
5.0,A good looking Belt!
5.0,"Very fast shipment, grandson loved it!!"
5.0,My kiddo loves these shoes. Great fit and looks nice
5.0,My daughter loves it.  Great quality.
5.0,"IT LOOK VERY GOOD FOR THE MONEY YOU PAY ITS LOOK BEAUTIFUL ON MY NECK, I GOT MY MONEY OUT OF HOW THE CHAIN LOOK I LOVE THE CHAIN.(GET FIVE STARS ) HAVE A BLESS DAY."
5.0,"Snazzy, comfortable, durable. I ride 3x per week on moderate trails. The gloves don't show much wear. I love the vibrant colors, they are lightweight. I don't expect they'll be warm in the winter, but a great full finger glove for warmer weather."
5.0,"This 80L bag is wonderful. It is made of high quality, tough materials. The interior frame is sturdy, yet lightweight. It takes a bit of trial and error to get the perfect fit when it's loaded up, but once I got there, this pack wears very comfortably.<br /><br />Don't waste money on the 60L. No internal frame and the materials are thinner."
5.0,The standard Fitbit band kept failing on me. I had replaced it twice and decided to go a totally different way. This band has been very durable and extremely comfortable. No issues and I have been wearing it everyday for the past 6 months. And I have a spare because there are two in the package!!  Definitely give this one a serious look!
5.0,"My son loved his hoodie, will purchase more."
5.0,"Arrived on time, looks and feels great!"
5.0,"Came with everything that you get from MK stores. Cover MK bag,key & locket and strap. Serial number located inside.  Looks amazing. Wife loved her Valentines gift"
5.0,"These are terrific socks at a great value! My 12-pack was all black; I had wanted navy blue also, but am not the least disappointed. They are soft, light and do NOT slip inside your shoe. Great price for great socks!"
5.0,My daughter loves them and gets compliments on how cute
5.0,It's got a super cute face and the details are lovely. Great quality! I only wish they came in half sizes as I am actually a size 5.5 and not a 6. Overall beautiful ring.
5.0,Love these so much. They look especially good with a hat. Definitely my summer glasses.
5.0,Great Tops. Fits well
5.0,[[VIDEOID:78d156e7f02ed700629f9603ce011780]]
5.0,I like them. They're thin but not super thin. I wear them with my crosstrainer sneakers and by themselves around the house.
5.0,I love them. Comfortable and warm.
5.0,Comfort and quality along with the high waist fit is great
5.0,Defiantly what the kid likes. Does look really cool on.
5.0,"Perfect choice. Wearing them with sneakers. Be sure your sneakers fit comfortably on the top part of your foot as the sock does not cover that part. Back stays in place. Get them, they are great."
5.0,"These shorts are so comfortable! Feels like butter when you put them on. The length is mid thigh but i have slender legs so it does ride up. i have to pull them down and adjust after sitting.<br /><br />Also, I can confirm that the waist doesnt get too tight after eating a huge meal and being bloated, still just extremely comfortable.<br /><br />Tried at the gym and pleased to know the shorts are squat proof as well!<br /><br />The grayish-blue color is really pretty in person, material is super soft. I will definitely buy more of these and will be a staple in my summer wardrobe."
5.0,"ANOTHER GREAT BUY, DELIVERY TIME WAS PRETTY GOOD."
5.0,"One of the best finds on Amazon, this shirt company is so awesome. I've bought every shirt of theirs in medium and the fit is perfect. Very masculine and great design. The quality is so good. I wish they had more options in designs and sizes, please give us a bigger selection. My new favorite clothing company!"
5.0,"good price, and seem well made."
5.0,Omg I love it ...love love love I was nervous about the fit....it fits wonderful material is rich! I will continue to buy this brand.
5.0,Fast Delivery and great quality.
5.0,The fabric is comfortable and the dress fits nice. The skirt is lose enough its flattering.
5.0,I love the dress. It is great with a cardigan. Feels really good on. Great summer dress for dinner and parties
5.0,"I love this necklace.  It adds a great pop of color to outfits and is very nice looking in person.  It is a little heavy, so if weight around your neck bothers you, this may not be the right necklace for you.  I received multiple compliments when I wore this.  Love it!"
5.0,These scarves are great for the price. I'm happy with the colors I've selected and will purchase more from this seller. I receive compliments all the time about my beautiful scarves.
5.0,"I nearly cried when I received them...I was concerned with obviously the authenticity of them and they are very real and I'm truly in love, the color way is amazing.. I can't wait to rock them. I had my eye on them for months and watched a lot of YouTube reviews and every one who reviewed them only had positive feedback. I plan on doing a review and try on my YouTube channel from a woman's point of view. Only issue was the price if I would of purchased them when they first came out of course I would of paid a cheaper price but I couldn't resist. I'm a size 7 in woman's my last Jordan purchase I got a big kids size 5 and they are a little big so I went for a 4.5 and Im glad I did."
5.0,"LOVE these.  They are so soft and comfortable, and they lay really nice. They are very flattering because of the &#34;flow&#34; and the length.  I am 5'8&#34;, 165lbs, and I ordered the large.  I usually wear a medium, but I didn't want to deal with the possibility of the wedgie which can happen with this material.  They sort of have a silky flow and hang like a skirt, so I don't think they add any visual weight by going up a size.  My waist is small in relation to my hips/butt, so they don't fall down.  If you are more of a straight figure, perhaps the larger size would slip down.  They fit me perfectly.  I had to cut about 1&#34; off the length (which many reviews complained about them being so long... it is clearly written that the bottoms are unfinished to allow for desired length by trimming)  The material does not fray, and they sort of curl gently so they don't need a hem.  The extra length is the greatest feature! I have such a hard time finding pants that are long enough, especially when they are wide bottoms. They are so light and airy, and not at all see-through.  I plan on wearing them in the hot (90 degree) summer with a light t-shirt and I think they will make the hot days more comfortable.  I also bought them in other colors (prints and solids) and I love that I can wear them with flip flops for casual, a wedge sandal for a more chic look, or a heel and blouse for a dressy look. Just love them and recommend them! (pictured are the Burgundy Paisley)"
5.0,I ordered this packet of rings in order to have extras. Once they came in the mail it became the rings I wear daily. I have had zero issues since I began wearing them. The rings are sturdy and look great.
5.0,Stunning!
5.0,arrived quickly and fit is perfect. Thank You
5.0,A beautiful bra that fit me perfectly! It‚Äôs very comfortable and beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised.
5.0,Great material and fit.
5.0,Love these socks. Very breathable.
5.0,"I have SEVERAL of these tops in various colors and I never fail to get complements  on them when I wear one!!! They hold up well under multiple washings, VERY minimal piling,  fit GREAT, and comfortable!"
5.0,"Love this shirt! Comfy, great fit, great color!"
5.0,This was perfect. My boyfriend is a drummer and they call him &#34;Animal&#34; they had a performance on our local TV station and it came in time for him to be on air with it. It was a hit he absolutely loved it. Check em out &#34;The Magic Lightnin' Boys&#34;
5.0,"The lace s very pretty , n the dress fits true to size. The color is navy and red not purple and red sorry overall I love it . My Christmas dress ."
5.0,Like how stretchy it is. Bought to support a friend of a friend
5.0,"For me, it was either pay for prescription sunglasses or these. turns out, I made a pretty sound choice. They actually ARE polarized, they fit over my entire lens, and are so light I don't even notice them. Seriously. I've seen a few reviews where folks said that the clip was in their line of sight, but I have not noticed this at all. They're super easy to put on, and fit close enough to my actual glasses that there is virtually no glare from light coming in between the clip on and my frame. Just make sure you measure correctly. I bought the largest size; I have half-frame glasses (the bottom half of my lens is frameless) and the fit is perfect."
5.0,These jeans are so cute. They are stretchy and soft and fit really well. Very happy with these jeans
5.0,"Bought this for my 10yo she's on the taller side so I was unsure if I should buy her kid or adult. Glad I went with the kid this fits great, it has the perfect stretch and fits great around the arms and legs without causing irritation to skin. Great material as well."
5.0,"This is beautiful, but it does run large. It would probably be better suited for something like a midi ring."
5.0,Great sleep wear for the price. The pattern helps hide food stains
5.0,"Nice, fit well with long enough ties to tie in front. A lot better than polyester. Great value"
5.0,Always receive compliments when I wear.  Fabric is soft and wrinkle proof.
5.0,"Love these, my friend told me they were so cool, they were rock star glasses, and I'm 67"
5.0,"I have that body type where it is VERY hard to find jeans for. Ever since I've graduated high school, all I've worn had been leggings. These are truly the best in both worlds! Fit and feel like leggings, look like skinny jeans! I will be buying more pairs, and I definitely recommend!"
5.0,Just what I wanted!  Working great and not pulling hair
5.0,Cute dress. Looks exactly like the photo and fits well. For more conservative ladies might be a bit too short.
5.0,LOve them for every day use.
5.0,"One of my favorite shirts.  It's unique and colorful.  A nice day brightener.  A tad see through, you can't get away with wearing a dark bra but not see through enough to require another layer"
5.0,I really like it! Should know that it seems to be a spandex-y/lycra material so may cling to undershirts. Sleeves are a bit long. I am 5'2&#34; 170lbs and the XL fit just right. Would buy again. Love it though!
5.0,It actually guess what I was looking for
5.0,"Wish they had more. Can‚Äôt find any plain black or grey in a size small. These are actually my fav leggings being super small and petite they fit well, they‚Äôre soft and comfortable"
5.0,"I don‚Äôt have vortex binos but this seems to be the ultimate bino harness. Holds my leupolds great with room to spare. Hopefully hold my Nikon rangefinder as well.<br /><br />Lots of adjustments, takes awhile to get fit right.<br /><br />Made in USA, so that kind of took out the sting of the price a bit. Seems like it will really hold up.<br /><br />Hope it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of my taking a shot with my bow."
5.0,"Excellent, study and very attractive"
5.0,My son lost the original band for his watch and this was the perfect replacement. The color is lovely and it works like a charm.
5.0,My son absolutely loves these pants. The quality feels nice and it's strong. The design is nice and simple. Easy to wash. He wears them all the time. Must buy.
5.0,"I have only used a couple of these to sublimate on. They are a nice quality, and subbed beautifully. Good find! I will be ordering more. Good packaging as well."
5.0,This is the second pair I ordered. I always take them with me if I have to take shoes off in a person's home.  I only wear them inside.

5.0,This cotton is of such good quality it‚Äôs silky. I love it for a casual summer dress or dressed up with a cardigan and accessories. I wish this length came in a style with office appropriate sleeves or straps. Still love it
5.0,Exactly as pictured. Extra star for soft material.
5.0,"Comfy, love the back enclosure. I got a size medium because I found out recently I am pregnant and expecting chest to grow. I like that I could use it as a sports bra but also a bralette to show under a top or dress. This is my 3rd bra from this brand and I highly recommend üëå"

5.0,Love these! So comfortable!
5.0,"Love the look of this swimsuit! Because it‚Äôs super comfortable, I can wear it just like a dress or pair a cute bottom with it. Definitely recommend it!"
5.0,nive its a little on the heavy side but over all nice braclet
5.0,This thing is great.  I had something similar years back that was made out of plastic and it broke after a few uses.  Being made of wood it is practically indestructible compared to the plastic counterpart.
5.0,Very nice band. Fit onto my fit bit versa 2 with no problems. Its slim and looks more feminine than the large wide bands rhat come with it in my opinion.<br />Color leabs more toward a pink purple but I love it. The underside is leather which is nice also. Fit is good. Fees sturdy.
5.0,"I purchased this necklace with charm for my granddaughter.  This is absolutely adorable.  It arrived at my home well package and in a small black gift box.  Because the doggy pendant is made of .925 silver it was a bit tarnished when it arrived but a little work with a silver polishing cloth and the tarnish was gone.  I shortened the chain a bit because she is a petite nine year and it hung to long on her. All of her friends now want there moms and grandmas to buy one of these necklaces for them.  It is a real hit.  I would not hesitate to recommend this chain and pendant.  The price is right and it is made extremely well.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for writing a review based on the results of my testing it.

5.0,Works well.  It is a little short and I was unsure if it would fit over my huge head. It did!
5.0,"Wonderful fun for little ones, fits, washes and ware‚Äôs  nice:)"
5.0,This mask is adorable and comes with removable filters.  I love the color and the adjustable straps.

5.0,They turned out to be better than expected!! I love them. I have wanted them for a while now!! Thanks!
5.0,"I am so glad I purchased this!  I was afraid it would look too gold, but it's really a metallic champagne color.  Perfect!"
5.0,"We have had several pairs of these high tops, in multiple colors.  I have three very active girls ages 3,6,&9.  They have put a beating on these shoes.  They have held up nicely.  My six year old is the roughest on these shoes and just now after almost daily wear for seven months are we seeing fraying around the ends of the Velcro straps.  The fabric and the hook and loop are separating just slightly.  They are still wearable and great for play shoes.  My nine year old doesn't wear hers as frequently and there is not any fraying on her shoe in the same seven months.  These are great affordable shoes."
5.0,My son loves these! He is a loyal consumer (via me). He's 5 and on the smaller size and we buy XL. Love these and worth the price.
5.0,A little heavy but great for the winter. The sharks are what make it ü¶à
5.0,"I like this shawl. It's comfortable and a little like wearing a blanket. The design is lovely, too. For me, it's best for lounging around or walking, but not best for doing any type of activity/chore. If I wear it while I'm trying to do pretty much anything but walk or sit, it gets in the way. The front part will get in whatever is in front of me and it's just plain dangerous to wear while cooking. (I like wearing shawls around my house, just for the extra warmth and modesty, depending on what I'm wearing underneath, but I don't tend to wear them in public.) It's on the thicker side, so it's great for cold days. I've been super happy with it."
5.0,Beautiful dress! I got a lot of compliments on it for New year's! Fits good. I usually where a size 11 in pants and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Fits well for pregnancy

5.0,Perfect for Halloween and upcoming renissance fair :)
5.0,Soft and lighter material and stylish
5.0,"I got this as a mother's day gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it. It is sturdy and well-crafted. This card cubby looks as though it will hold together for many years worth of use. It is attractive, with a vibrant color. It is spacious and will hold many cards, with alphabetical tabs to separate cards by their first letter. Great product. Thank you."
5.0,Excellent so far. Looks and feels good.
5.0,just what we were looking for
5.0,Loved!!!
5.0,Scratch very easily<br />Replaced lens for me
5.0,My granddaughter looks so pretty!
5.0,"Great band, better than expected."
5.0,"These are some of the best little kid fairy wings we've tried so far. Durable, they're easy to mold back into shape of squished. The wand seems flimsy, but has held up really well so far, even after a little boy played rough with it.<br />The flower crown is lovely, and the ribbons provided are easy to braid into hair for a secure fairy crown."
5.0,"silky smooth and rich blue color- it was free with my silk robe purchase. ample room for a pair of shoes-however i use it for a mini overnite tote.  and got compliments on it.  easy to carry. i fit my silk nightgown,the silk robe i purchased from Amazon toiletries and 2 DVDs in it! and of course a pair of slippers..."
5.0,"I could have sized down with this dress, otherwise it's very cute. I love the neckline on this dress and I get a lot of compliments on it! It can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion, I usually wear it to the office with tights and boots."
5.0,These are my favorite leggings. I own them in every color!
5.0,"Great value and practicality!  Get compliments every  time  I carry it.<br />Used to buy only kavu, like the style with drink holders better."
5.0,"It‚Äôs super easy to adjust, fits any size wrist."
5.0,"These socks are pretty great.  They fit over our kids' shin guards perfectly and our kids think they look pretty cool.  Other than that, it's a pair of socks.  How much could I actually write in a review about a pair of socks?  It's not like there's some kind of sock revelations made here that there aren't in any other pair of socks.  They aren't like space socks or anything like that.  You're not going to put these on and be like &#34;OMG THESE ARE THE BEST SOCKS IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE I HAVE TO TELL THE WORLD ABOUT THEM.&#34;  You will probably be more like, &#34;welp, these are exactly what I thought they would be.  And the price was fair.&#34;  Then you'll probably be like &#34;Braiyden, go put on your socks.  We need to leave for your game in 3 minutes.  Braiyden, I'm going to count to three.  One....two...thank you.  No, shin guards first.  BODEN, LEAVE YOUR BROTHER ALONE.  Braiyden, I'm leaving now with or without you.  BYE!!!  GOODBYE!!!!  Heading to the van now!!  Braiy....stop...stop crying and get your socks.  Yes, I have your juice box.  Dad, are you ready?  It's 11:30 you don't need any more coffee.

5.0,It's a little on the large side but I love it. Washes well line dry.
5.0,My wife has been beading for about a year now. This storage tray is the best thing she has found for keeping her beads safely stored. They are easy to see into without opening the individual containers. Only the single containers you need open have to be open at any given time. This is especially great when the cat jumps up on her work area - far fewer beads get spilled.
5.0,"I ordered larger than normal and it was perfect!  I ordered a Large and I am 5'6 125.  I got so many compliments on it, it looks designer.  It's my new fav!"

5.0,"Beautiful necklace ! Put together very well, sturdy!"
5.0,love them. super comfy and super cute!
5.0,So cute and sexy! The dangle piece broke after a month. I think it was worth 8$
5.0,Was a Valentines gift for my fianc√© for him to wear for our wedding. It‚Äôs perfect. Fits him so nicely. Came in a nice box with a pillow and even the tool to adjust if needed. Feels like it was built well and won‚Äôt break easily. We both Absolutely love it.
5.0,"I was sceptical that these slippers would hold up.  But they have!  I love them, wear them every day.  They are comfortable.  Rubber sole allows me to walk around without wearing them out or slipping around.  They are just cute as a button.  Buying shoes online is risky. I got the jackpot with these!"
5.0,very pretty perfect size great for St. Patrick's Day & all year
5.0,"Excellent for golf, going out and swimming. Not many other shorts can offer that kind of diversity of activity"
5.0,"Gift for my mother, she loves them very soft after washing."
5.0,"I ordered the large to be safe that it wasn‚Äôt too tight.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 140 lbs. It fight good in all areas, maybe a little long in the legs but I have large upper thighs so it worked for me.  Great quality and I got tons of compliments on it.  Would totally buy again.  And it was the least expensive costume I‚Äôve had for Halloween."
5.0,"Love these undies. I‚Äôm super picky. Undies have to cover my butt, not be tight around my tummy or thigh and be high enough in the back so that the tags to my jeans doesn‚Äôt tickle me.<br /><br />Well as I‚Äôm sure you guessed. These undies meet all those qualifications üòÅ I have bought so many."

5.0,Very nice on my feet. Soft materials. I just needed more for the summer when I change often.
5.0,"I have a few girly type beanies but this one is unlike a beanie but super cute!üíï The visor is hard and does not wilt so perfect for bright cold days. The material is 100% Merino wool so its extra warm too. It covers your head fully and the visor gives you good shade for extra sunny days, however the design has an extra layer like a beanie, so if you want to cover your earns and the back of your head fully, it could do that too. I love the color as well, mild and easy on the eyes, will match with any outfit. I highly recommend getting this cute Jeff & Aimy hat cap beanie with a visor as a gift or for yourself. ü§©üëçüëç"
5.0,"Super soft fabric, that is not see-through. Great fit and flattering. Love the pockets."

5.0,Luv'd luv'd luv'd it!!!!
5.0,Love this top. Great with leggings.
5.0,"Man's best friend.  This wallet may be too small for some people. it really is slim and requires folding up any currency you are going to put inside.  There are times I can't carry it when I do need to cart around more than it's slim styling can handle which is a shame, but I still love the thing.  Thank you Bellroy."
5.0,"The sterling silver lotus flower pendant is lovely and the size I had expected based on the information and the picture of the wearer--not too small.  Although the chain that comes with it is quite nice, I had wanted a pendant I could remove and wear on other silver chains of various lengths, and this pendant can do that.  I am pleased with this selection."
5.0,love this and it came with the little tab to attach it to a brick.
5.0,The online images don't do this enough justice! I love it! Saving it for when I make that special appearance
5.0,"I LOVE these! $9.99 and they fit me better than even my Under Armour pair. I have 2 pair and will definitely be getting more!! I saw where some people complained of them being see through. They're not on me, they stretch and you can see the white interior lining, lightening up the color some but definitely NOT see through."
5.0,Ordered for my granddaughter. She loved it.
5.0,I gave these to my son-in-law and he's using them. They look cute too!
5.0,"I'm a huge baseball fan, and I love the movie The Natural. So when I saw the Roy Hobbs jersey on Amazon I knew I had to pick one up. It fits great and looks good. The sleeve patches add to the retro nostalgia feel of the jersey, too. Most of all I was impressed by its price. If you're a fan like I am I would highly recommend buying this jersey."
5.0,I love these shoes so much. I bought 2 pair and wish the others were available because I would buy all of them! I can't find them online anywhere!! great for work!
5.0,It's cool. But I don't like the red stripe on it.
5.0,"Love love this costume. Super soft and so cute!! Plus, I got this for half the price! Such a steal. My son was so excited to wear it to school to show his friends on costume day."

5.0,Me encanta su dise√±o y su calidad.
5.0,Super cute and I love that the rhinestones are iridescent. It fits perfectly and has straps to adjust the size. One of the rhinestones must have fell off at one point but you can‚Äôt really tell. I get a lot of compliments on this mask!
5.0,"My little loves this! Great quality, not stiff like some canvas bags can be. Easy to clean and her piano books fit perfectly!! Also her name is on both sides!! We love it!!"

5.0,May want to go up a size when ordering. I wear a large and nought large. It fits but a little snug around the shoulder/arm area. I should have return and order a extra large but we were going to a get together and wanted to wear it. I am happy with the jacket and have received  many compliments and asked if this was Rip's jacket.  Love the attention it brings and hey when I shed a few more pounds it will be perfect fit.
5.0,"Prior reviews stated this swimsuit ran a bit small, so I ordered up a size and am very pleased with the purchase. Excellent fit, comfortable and not binding at all. Washing instructions with all such items, cold wash is best. They are comfortable and are great for tanning. Great suit for a great price. I'm happy they have pockets like normal shorts."

5.0,HIGHEST QUALITY - NICEST BAND I EVER GOT
5.0,Pretty typical! No complaints.
5.0,Bought 2 of these shorts for leg day.I love these better than the name brands I‚Äôve tried and these are way cheaper too.The biggest problem I see is sizing.i am a 32 waist and a medium was still a little loose.Still looks great tho so I kept it.I also bought 2 pairs of the loose type shorts(not these fitted ones)from the same brand/seller and those were too  big.I kept them for lounging.For lounging it is perfect but not for gym.So if I am gonna do it again I‚Äôd probably get a size down.
5.0,my daughter loved this dress was great and arrived early..
5.0,"I use this to go under my swimsuits when I do workout classes in the water. They are perfect for that. Many swimsuits drop down to low for my taste when you are working out and this adds an extra cover without adding bulk. Plus, I love the color on the trim that matches the swimsuit."

5.0,I love this bra. I plan on ordering more

5.0,The best gloves and the best price. Perfect size.

5.0,It fits very good perfectly
5.0,Recipient loved the softness and coziness of this top. Pockets are great too!
5.0,"This suitcase is awesome!!!  I traveled for 2 weeks across southern England and Paris and only used this suitcase and the eBags Mother Load backpack. I was looking for something that made the best use of space and could fit a much as possible.  It is very well designed and using any of the outer compartments/pockets or the mesh pocket on the inside did not take away from the size of the main compartment by pushing into it.  I used the eBag travel cubes to keep my clothes organized, which helped a lot to keep everything from getting wrinkled  and made a great use of the small space.  It expands well to add lots of extra room.  I did check it at the airport, so can't comment on how it does getting into overheads.<br /><br />One of the main things I was most impressed with this suitcase was the design was perfect and it did not once tip over when being wheeled around or standing upright despite me attaching my very heavy eBags mother load backpack to the collapsible handle and an additional regular backpack.  Despite me cramming it (probably) too full and attaching additional bags to it, it wheeled smoothly across level floors and was not too difficult to wheel around London and the cobblestone sidewalks we had to use to get to the underground.  I felt a bit sorry for my travel companions and the amount of trouble they had with the small wheels on their luggage and for how often they tipped over.<br /><br />I'd recommend this bag to anyone!  It was perfect for my needs, it makes great use of space, the zippers are very strong, it expands well, and fits a ton.  On the eBags website there is a video where they go over all the features of the suitcase which I found very helpful in deciding to purchase this bag."
5.0,"Son preciosos, estoy enamorada de mis aretes üòç"
5.0,Worked exactly as described
5.0,A wonderful jewelry set for a little girl. It is much prettier when you receive it than what the picture shows.

5.0,Nice Jacket - great fit XXL I‚Äôm 6‚Äô6‚Äù tall. I was in the Golf business for 10 years & I know Sun Mountain makes quality products. Yes the Zipper is plastic - I don‚Äôt want a Metal Zipper on a Rain Jacket in a lightning storm - it‚Äôs rugged & can be worn on or off the golf course. I‚Äôve worn it several times so far & no problems. I‚Äôd buy another of the same in a heartbeat. 5 STARS !
5.0,Bought as a gift for my son. He loved it. Fit and looks well

5.0,"This costume jewelry gold color necklace is really cute with a faux pearl (bead) in a heart-shaped cage and a small faux pearl (bead) hanging from a 2‚Äù chain that drops from the cage. This necklace is delicate and made of lightweight materials. This chain is only 15-1/2‚Äù long, though it can lengthen to 17-1/2‚Äù with the attached 2‚Äù extender. This necklace has nice details for a budget piece, such as a little heart at the end of the extender and a lobster claw clasp instead of a little ‚ÄúO‚Äù ring closure.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and in my 50‚Äôs and would wear this even though the style is young, but it looks too petite and short on me. But I do think it‚Äôs a darling budget necklace (currently $16.99) for a preteen, teen or someone petite. On that basis, I‚Äôm rating it 4.5 stars."
5.0,"I was very surprised that a gag hockey jersey would be this good.  I got it for a Super Soft Letterkenny Party that I was invited to, but I intend to wear it to pretty much ANY hockey event I go to.  I've had actual hockey jerseys in the past, and this isn't that quality, but it is durable and the patches are sewn on well.  I'm 5'8"", and fairly curvy.  I got a Medium, and it is not as loose as I would like it around my hips, but not tight--I think a Large would be far too big. Highly recommend."
5.0,My husband likes the night shirt.  He especially likes the length as his legs get cold at night and this gown is long on him.
5.0,Great casual dress. Wore it to lunch and got tons of compliments. I am 5. And 180 I got an XL fit just right. Pockets fit my phone.
5.0,Love how they make it easier to see the screen and make it for it doesn‚Äôt hurt your eye

5.0,These where perfect for our 11 yr old up to our 25 yr old. With many styles to choose from made everyone happy.
5.0,"I had this ring in silver and would wear it as my vacation wedding ring,I lost it on vacation and this will be my new vacation wedding ring."
5.0,"I bought this scarf in white, just received it in the mail today (2 days before the expected delivery date!), and am already back to buy more colors. I wear a scarf almost every day at work but I don't like the ones that add so much bulk to my neck/chest area. This is the PERFECT scarf for a cute pop of color without looking like you're bundled up for a winter storm."
5.0,As a base layer it is great! I tend to be cold in winter but with this base layer I only need an additional shirt and a sweater to stay warm.
5.0,Excellent look and ppl noticed them and asked where I ordered them.
5.0,Solid retro looking watch. Nice dome crystal.
5.0,"Great to find a good old fashioned sweatshirt. Market seems to be overtaken by annoying hoodies. With a relatively light weight material, this brand also comes in a modest variety of colors."

5.0,"Great travel bag, llight, many pockets, top zipper, and doesn't show wear."
5.0,The large fit fine. Good quality no difference compared to the more expensive ones.
5.0,"This top is made of a fabric that is reveling, and it's short enough that it barely covers what's under it. My girl looks Good, Good, Good with it on!"
5.0,Got them on now! Great fit and grips the barre tight! I definitely recommend these scks
5.0,"Nice pendant, my daughter loves it"
5.0,this product is just right and it is soft durabule and great color
5.0,"My previously badly cracked, scaled and, splintered fingertips are a, sure enough, daily ouch.  I put the gloves on right after arrival and have yet to take them off.  The fingers fit on Camel Crown gloves as if they grew there; no webbing between the fingers. Short of washing dishes, my hands can do any task pain-free! Great help for me. Thank you much!"
5.0,I am pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"Este producto le encant√≥ a mi hija, y lleg√≥ en el tiempo dicho."
5.0,These are some of the best shoes I have ever purchased. These actually help my plantar fasciitis!
5.0,"It's reliable, easy to read and attractive"
5.0,"I'm 220lb and it was very hard for me to zip the boots. But I think that was due to my super oversized calf (19inch). I'm still able to zip it on with some help. Otherwise, there is memory foam in there and it was very comfy to walk with it in this weather. Finally I get a boots!"
5.0,"Super lightweight and comfortable looks exactly the same as in the picture supportive ,well made"
5.0,"I just bought this sweater dress for my wife and she loves it! It‚Äôs an oversize model with very nice material and very¬†it is¬†stylish. She bought a small, but the style is oversized and gives her a comfortable feeling. Love the product!"
5.0,"Love it.  Perfect cover up for the beach, but cute enough to wear on a warm summer evening."
5.0,"I bought one of these for my daughters preschool teacher as well as my sister in law, they both love them and they look great! Now I want one! Great product! Thank you!"
5.0,"this shirt came to me very fast and I got it very inexpensive,  the tag on the shirt was about $50 and I get it for just less than half of that. with the tags still on it, ship very fast."
5.0,"The case is ok for protecting your sunglasses, though it is soft, so be careful not to squish them, and they included a microfiber wipe to keep them clean and smudge-free. The mirrored lenses look good and block plenty of light on sunny days to protect your eyes. Nice quality all around!"
5.0,"I'm 5'2&#34; 115lbs with a 26 inch waistline and I don't recommend anyone bigger than me to purchase a small because they fit just perfect for me, if not a teeny bit tight! I like them a lot and it was a great deal but I have experienced running threads on the first wear already. I would still recommend because they are very comfortable."
5.0,"Very nice aviators. The frame is rigid with very little flex. Glass lenses which I like, but does make them a little heavier. They have adjustable nose pieces and feel like much more expensive glasses."
5.0,Happy feet are feet that wear these :)
5.0,"When I requested these the photos were not available, just a small pic on the request page, the one with the big batwing shoulders effect. I do not know how they managed that look but it is really misleading.<br /><br />These are an extremely comfortable set of, for my purposes, PJ.s, but these days you often see people out and about in sleepwear, anything goes, but personally I would not be wearing them out and about as depicted.<br /><br />The fabric is a really nice midweight ribbed knit, that is super soft.<br /><br />They look way better then the pics and just feel so comfy, I love them!"
5.0,These shoes are Lit
5.0,"My mom loves attractive clothing that conforms to the body well whilst I enjoy a looser fit. That's why the Liumilac Woman's Elegant shirt is perfect for her. It offers just enough elastic to give it some stretch for comfort during movement yet conforms to get body well flattering her curves. The nice dark Navy color keeps things looking slim, professional and classy. The front pleated style with ruffles gives it a nice feminine touch. The material feels well made, stitching is neat and fabric is breathable. The price point is great offering high quality style at budget friendly prices. Would definitely recommend this beautiful skirt."
5.0,Great quality!!! Fit my 4 year old perfect!
5.0,"Wow!  What a great find.  I'm very pleased with this set, I wasn't expecting much seeing as how it was &#34;cheapy&#34; costume jewelry but when I took it out of the package I couldn't believe how pretty it was!  Also, I noticed in the main picture above that the chain is silver, mine came in gold.  I didn't have the choice of metal color and some of the other pictures do depict gold coloring.  It still looks great, regardless of metal color, but it might matter to someone so I thought i would mention it!<br /><br />I would definitely order more to give as gifts."
5.0,Really Happy. Wantdo was great to buy from and helped choose the right size before ordering. Thinking of getting in other colors because I liked it so much
5.0,"I first read the reviews by others and that helped me immensely with my purchase. I'm 5'6&#34;, I fluctuate between a 37&#34; to 37 1/2&#34; hip and 120 to 123 lbs. Therefore I purchased the size 6/L as recommended. The 6/L fit me like a glove...not too tight and not too loose. I love this skirt!<br />I have a lot of artsy tops & rock and rolly tops that have been waiting for such a skirt...just haven't had the opportunity to pair them up with<br />anything yet. Now I do. This skirt is sexy, unique and cute. I'll use it as a 3 seasons piece for (fall, winter and spring)."
5.0,Exactly what i expected loved them

5.0,This bow is so adorable! I bought it for my almost one year old for her cake smash. It is well made and looks great.
5.0,Loved the shirt but it was too small. This cut for this shirt you would need to go up 2 sizes.
5.0,A like new purchase that blew me away. This is a gorgeous watch. Look at Mulco products and I dare you to find a copy of any other maker.
5.0,Worked out great for our Covid Halloween outfits!
5.0,Impeccable quality and very functional
5.0,"I got this because I was looking for an organizer for all my cords that I bring to work and school everyday.  At first I thought it was too small but surprisingly I could fit my Apple Laptop Charger, Power bank, phone charger on the grid and my kindle on back pouch. Excellent!"
5.0,"Cuter than I expected. Robe is super soft. Not difficult to pack back into itself. Most importantly, my daughter loved it."
5.0,Great shoes. Comfy.

5.0,I love everything about these boots!!! Super cute...
5.0,"I legit would pay $25 for these. I lose and break sunglasses alot and I was more upset doe these than i was when I ignorantly spent $200 on some Oakley's and lost them. They're great for blocking sun, you can wear them inside (if you're &#34;that guy&#34;) or at night and still see great. They're comfortable, stylish, and cheap. Just for comparison I showed my wife the clearance rack at Walmart and a case like these come in was on clearance for 4.88, not including comfy stylish sun blocking shades."
5.0,An amazing vintage necklace for casual or evening wear.<br />Koh-KohVintage - I went by the dress size guide chart and the dress fits perfect.<br />Looking forward to order from same seller.<br />Completely satisfied with both orders
5.0,"My favorite watch ever was a Nixon &#34;the key&#34;. It had a silicon strap and I wore it every day for about 2 years, eventually the strap broke and I went watchless for a good long while. I happened upon the Sentry and purchased the tan with black face after trying the rose gold color on in a store. I've gotten tons of compliments on it and still do. I decided to buy the black and also the Pendleton versions recently as well.<br /><br />You should note that there are 2 different sizes of the Sentry available with perhaps some more desired color options in the larger size. I have a small wrist for a guy and the 38 fits perfect."
5.0,The fabric is smooth and not bulky like sweatpants. Lies flat even with side pockets. Back stretch makes it fit perfectly.
5.0,Very nice garment.  Well made and a good value.
5.0,I liked the gauge of the wire.
5.0,Great bag Receive many people commenting on it.
5.0,I don't write many reviews but this baselayer is really warm I live in the mountains in Colorado and it keeps me warm at about 20 with nothing but a sweater over it so to me that's warm for the thickness
5.0,"Good product, exactly what I ordered"
5.0,"The seams of the dress were a bit of an issue, but overrall it is a really pretty dress."
5.0,"These glasses work perfectly, even at night I use.<br />Dan enhance the color of things, you avoid affecting the brightness of the sun and mirrors Front highly recommend them, as they also look great."
5.0,My granddaughter saw this dress online and wanted it for the father daughter dance since it was a formal theme.  I ordered it but had my doubts that it would look as good in person.  It was lovely.  It fit well and my granddaughter was ever so happy.
5.0,"Comfortable, hilarious, affordable. What more can you want."
5.0,super comfortable. I have plantar fasciitis and these really helped my heels. Highly recommend. they look cuter than the photo.
5.0,Fashion sta<br />Statment
5.0,This dress is really comfortable and cute. I love it ü•∞
5.0,"Very pretty. A little smaller than we expected, but our fault because they had actual size measurements on the description. Packaged nicely. Seems very nice quality."
5.0,I love my keds. They arrived very fast. I find them so comfortable. I get so many compliments on them and they were cheaper than other sites.
5.0,Awesome way to rejuvenate an expensive pair of sunglasses! Lenses fit perfectly with no difficulty installing them.

5.0,Nice polyester shirt. Checkered color and sleeve. Not bad.
5.0,These are the most comfortable socks I have  ever worn.
5.0,"I bought these for protection during the pandemic and general use.  They are reasonably sturdy, but definitely in the ""disposable"" category.  I can wear them several times before they tear or wear out.  They compare well with any other household gloves."
5.0,Cutest little things!
5.0,I bought it for my 4 yr old who has swimming classes in a very cold pool.  I had ordered a small but it was too tight (she is a bit tall for her age) so I returned it for a medium and the fit was perfect.  She is super comfortable with it in the pool and has not complained about the water being cold.  Once wet it is a bit hard to take off but we just do it very slowly and with patience.  Overall a great buy and met my needs!
5.0,"I was a little worried that the holes would fray but they are burned through not drilled or punched so they hold up. Other than that what can you say it's a watch band.<br />Oh! I did use the d-ring or whatever it is on the end of the band, the one you would slide the other end through to close it, to open a beer. Pretty handy if all else fails."
5.0,Was for my husband.  He loves the way it fits on his ears and keeps the wind off.
5.0,"The snake-print shorts are so surprisingly soft and stretchy. They are thin and not really see-through, but I still wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them with my booty exposed. I got them to wear underneath an oversized sweater that I wear as a dress, and they're perfect! Like a second-skin - tight but not restricting at all."
5.0,Great socks at a great price. Super fast delivery. Highly recommend this seller!
5.0,Not cheap or flimsy

5.0,"I wore it once, the zipper twisted and I can't wear it again."
5.0,"I love cicadas and the sound that they make because they remind me of my childhood in the South and simpler times.  I put this cicada on my keychain.  The necklace that comes with it is useless, but the bug itself is attractively colored and nicely detailed.  Appears to be sturdy.  Arrived sooner than promised and is about 2 inches long --- almost the size of a real cicada."
5.0,"WE just got married and our ring bearer loves Batman, so we wanted to get him something special to wear with his little tux.  He LOVED THIS.<br />Great quality.  Makes me want one of my own."
5.0,I loved this dress and would have loved to have kept it but is was just a little snug in the hips.  Very cute dress.

5.0,just purchased another
5.0,"Love these boxers , part baby rib , part brief styling - all awesome !"
5.0,Bought this shirt for my 12 year old son to use for a costume. It‚Äôs a bit larger than I was hoping for a size small. He fits most men sized small shirts. No complaints on fabric though. It‚Äôs very reflective!
5.0,Super cute and great length!
5.0,"Love this cap, it‚Äôs good quality, and looks super awesome!"
5.0,Very pleased with product
5.0,Was a mother's day gift.  She wears it all the time.  Very nice !!

5.0,Durable quality materials fits ok
5.0,"No Gi thinking monkey, position before submission. My weight is on a Flux I like that these shorts have the pull strings."
5.0,"despite the month long shipping, this dress is the only thing I ever want to wear now.  It's perfect"
5.0,We have only tried them on but the quality seems amazing! Colors are a tad brighter in person than the pictures but pretty accurate overall. They ended up matching the top we got perfectly.<br /><br />I purchased the size XS for my just over 4yo who is 42.5‚Äù and 38lbs. The are a tad big in the waist but not so much that they are falling off of her. They go down to her knees which is exactly what I was hoping for.
5.0,"Don‚Äôt roll down or cut off my circulation, the compression seems tightest around the ankle but they work for my needs, don‚Äôt bunch up or slip around. They‚Äôre very polyester but the strip of copper seems to keep them semi fresh. Wish there was a similar product in cotton but of course, can‚Äôt be perfect."
5.0,"I love this top. It's slim fitting, which is flattering. It has some stretch as well. Would recommend."
5.0,It looks exactly like the picture! Great buy!
5.0,"The order came to $12.27 tax included! Try and beat that for an honestly nice pair of scuffs! They fit perfectly for my size 8M female foot. The color combo (silvery blue and gray) is rich and commands attention. The insole is comfy soft with ample foam. The outsole is just what it‚Äôs supposed to be, enuf said. These scuffs are definitely gift-able but buy them for you first! Fluff up the fur and you‚Äôll be glad you bought them from this seller!"
5.0,"very well made, clean, and looks ecxatly like what you see in the picture."
5.0,"Great slipper, which is hard to find these days. There is a lot of cheaply made product that either doesn‚Äôt fit well or last, or both. These are great. Excellent quality, reinforced heel, comes with a extra set of removable inserts. Only negative is they are a little squeaky, but I can live with that for the confort."
5.0,Fits very well and is a fantastic fall jacket. Absolutely love this and highly recommend it.
5.0,You can wear three different colors of flowers as well as just the diamond studs by themselves. That is four(4) different earrings in one purchase. Simply beautiful!!

5.0,Great to work with.
5.0,"I really like this keychain because I can wear it to the straykids concert I‚Äôm going to! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ the product overall is very excellent quality , came in perfect condition , and the letters are really pretty and holographic and they are really good quality"
5.0,The learning curve is quick and easy. My son enjoys these shoes. There is a bit of a breaking in period so bandaids may be needed.
5.0,This is my 3rd time purchasing the same glasses !!!I guess Im not the only one that love these glasses.ü§™
5.0,"Great quality dress for the price and shipping was faster than expected. I would buy off of this seller again when formal wear is needed. It was a bit long but that is expected, because I am short. I love the corset so that it can fit a range of body types."
5.0,High quality OUTSTANDING belt. Thick full grain leather and nice solid buckle. It came rolled in a nice box and was even in its own fabric sleeve. The idea of putting a longer than required belt with a provision to shorten it by the end user is BRILLIANT! Buy this belt.
5.0,"Beautiful and well made, loved, bought 6 sets for gifts."
5.0,My son loved it.  Fit great.
5.0,Ordered for a dancer who has trouble finding a hat big enough. He was blown away to find that this hat fit with 4 sizes still to go. Definitely a winner for multiple head sizes!

5.0,"I sized up 2 sizes.  I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù 135lbs and usually I wear a small size 2/4, for these I got a large and they fit perfect.  I can do squats and workout without my cheeks hanging out which is great."

5.0,Shirt as described. Very fast delivery!! Awesome. Thank you!

5.0,Tbh this band worth it for the money it‚Äôs comfortable!
5.0,This worked well during cold soccer games. Used with my Halo and i didn‚Äôt have to recharge the battery until after three or four games. Better than the blanket I purchased at the same time.
5.0,it looks like it's self in the picture & that's awesome
5.0,skirt was a little big but that was very simple fix. . . just moved the snap over a couple inches.
5.0,Best necklace ever
5.0,Comfort and lightweight
5.0,I love it üòÄ
5.0,Kids will love it!
5.0,Can‚Äôt wait to mori someone
5.0,Fit smaller than I expected but very cute and extremely comfortable
5.0,These are great boots!! My daughter wears them every day and loves them! They have held up really well so far and are her favorites! They keep her feet warm too on cold days. They also look nice and the quality is very good. Would buy again.
5.0,Sturdy attractive
5.0,"I'm a size 18 and the 18 fits perfectly. It might be a tiny bit bigger in some areas, but it's done in a way for comfort and not for looks. I especially love that it has a gel type ring around the top to prevent the dress from slipping down. Also, very flowy, definitely recommend."
5.0,"Very hard to find ,these are so comfortable"
5.0,"Purchased this convert my LV Neverfull pouches into crossbody bags. Obviously, the hardware isn‚Äôt as nice as my authentic Croisette LV strap. If anyone is concerned about that then I suggest they bite the bullet and purchase an authentic LV strap, such can be found on Rebag, Mercari, etc.<br />The leather is perfect quality and the red sealant on the sides is a nice color- not too thick or red. Overall, I believe this was a great purchase and worth the $$$$. :)"
5.0,My 2 year old daughter loves it. Fits her enough to still allow her to grow in it . Soft and comfortable .
5.0,Works exactly as described. Worked great.
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this apron is! It is a nice weight fabric and not thin. It does not look like a cheap apron. It is generously cut and the shoulder straps are adjustable. I am using it as part of a costume but I intend to use it after Halloween for cooking. I am a plus sized woman and it fits me well.
5.0,I gave this to a friend who is always giving me little origami animals. She loved it and put it on immediately.
5.0,Ordered for our 4 year old who loves Thomas.  The wallet of course is too big for his little pants pocket but he keep it in his thomas backpack that goes everywhere.  Good way to start teaching about money and being responsible early. Stitching so far is holding up well.
5.0,These were great to give away as a gift. I didn't realize initially the PS box was going to be quite as large as it is and it is is quite positively fitting for a gamer. Sock sizing is accurate and good quality.
5.0,Got these for my Daria costume (which sadly many people did not know who that was) and they were perfect!
5.0,Looking forward to trying them
5.0,These are so comfortable and cute for in and out of the office! I‚Äôm soooo picky about pants because of how short my legs are. But these are perfect!
5.0,Just a kick around the house shirt for my old lady. Great print and reasonably fast shipping
5.0,Very nice shirt.  Fits perfectly!
5.0,"Beautiful dress, and comfortable"
5.0,The best. This is the most rugged belt buckle I have ever run across. The belt itself is stitched and appears to be able to handle years of service. Sizing does run a little small. If in doubt move up a size.
5.0,True baller now yo! Fits great and is made of good materials that one would expect from a company like Adidas.
5.0,"I ordered the pink GI for  my granddaughter and it showed up on time, which was quick!  I love it!  It is absolutely beautiful, the color is vibrant and the quality is great, it is a great value well made Gi. I can‚Äôt wait to see her face when she opens it, pink is her favorite color. I highly recommend it and will be using elite sports for all my ever growing grandkids Jiujitsu needs."
5.0,They were just what I wanted
5.0,"I loved this glass bangles. I brought couple of them so far, comes exact size and packed so well. All glass bangles I ordered so far not a single one came broken. Thank you so much."
5.0,These shirt stays work. They stay attached to my shirt with constant sitting and standing. They seem to be very sturdy also compared to other shirt stays I have used.
5.0,top quality
5.0,Excelente y practico me encanta si ordenar√≠a otra de otros colores si la recomiendo ya que es como una pulsera y practica para entrar hacer cualquier diligencia de la vida cotidiana si la recomiendo perfecta para un regalo üéÅ a alguien especial üëèüèºü§©
5.0,It is very stylish and elegant looking. Goes extremely well with anything I wear whether casual or formal. It is also very comfortable to wear and I've had many favorable comments on it. So far no problems keeping accurate time or date.
5.0,Real Talk right here Please bring this back!
5.0,"Wow!! I was really hesitant to buy this dress because usually a cinched waist is not flattering on me as I am not very curvy. I am so impressed with this dress, especially for the cost!  The colors are a lot more vivid than I had expected and the neckline really isn't too low... could easily be stitched for a little extra coverage. I wish it was just a little tiny bit longer but that's just because I'm tall but it still hits below the ankles. At 5'9 ~160lbs I'm usually a size 8-10 and a Medium was perfect. I am about to look into ordering another color now!"
5.0,I purchased these shoes to complement the Ariel dress that I bought for my niece to wear for her 5th birthday party.  All I can say is that she loved them!  She felt like a princess in them and still wears them to this day..1 month later.  I received the item on time and with no quality issues.
5.0,"I enjoy my jacket, I wear it w/my army pants and always get compliments."
5.0,Hubby loves it. sturdy material and great saying.
5.0,Very comfortable and cute!
5.0,"It's quite soft, very comfortable to wear during Summer.  going to buy the blue one~"
5.0,Very nice and stylelish. Cool to wear and adjustable inner drawstrkng makes perfect fit possible.
5.0,"Kept me warm in frigid -3F weather, when I had to wear a skirt and walk around all day in between business meetings. I highly recommend these!"
5.0,Great bag so far
5.0,The bra cups are spaced a little too widely for me. That is only because you cannot select bottom and top sizes independently. I will be able to take the top in right in the middle and it should be fine.
5.0,"I bought this dress for church, and it was perfect. It wasn't too warm or too cold. Fits good like the rest of connected dresses but the arms are pretty wide and makes me feel like my arms wider than they are. But when you wear a cardigan over it, it buches up. I am 4 feet 11 inches and it covers my knees. Overall, I love the material and the color and I got compliments on it."
5.0,This fits as expected and goes over your swim or perfectly it's very light and Airy and yet it covers you up perfectly and it helps your swimsuit Drive perfectly because it's so thin but yet it's doesn't allow anyone to see your swimsuit underneath and helps keep you modest
5.0,Love this Necklace
5.0,Nice quality! The color looks the same as in the picture.
5.0,So cute.  Fits perfectly and everything I expdcted!
5.0,"love always, is how I celebrate my mom that has moved on to greener pastures. help me remember the good times"
5.0,On the small side but they look beautiful
5.0,"fantastic product, l am going to make logo shirts out of these and will be ordering many more"
5.0,Love these pants! So light weight hardly even notice them! Will order these again
5.0,"These worked well to replace the straps on my in-line skates, which had only straps and no ties."
5.0,"Great product and quality, really looks good!<br /> Too  bad they didn‚Äôt have a smaller size when I was returning it. I tried one size I though it would be equivalent to 34DDD that I normally use but the cups were HUGE."
5.0,"It's a great headband! Stays well positioned when working out, and keeps your hair cute! :)"
5.0,It does the job. Its not super bright but its reflective.
5.0,Great for projects
5.0,"I am a very feminine woman. VERY feminine. Like, lace and ruffles and makeup and high heels on a regular basis kind of feminine. Therefore, when I saw lacy socks, I had to have them! I wear flats, loafers, and heels regularly as opposed to the flip flops and sneakers I usually see on other women of my age and younger, and these appeared to be a godsend from the get go, because being feminine does not include foot odor and blisters!<br /><br />As soon as they arrived, I ripped open the package and put them on. I have purchased lace no show style socks before, only to be disappointed at the slippage and rolling up they inevitably seem to do which is not only uncomfortable, but renders the socks completely unusable and entirely impractical.<br /><br />Upon opening these, I was surprised to see a silicone gripping strip running right around the top interior of the sock. ‚Äúoh no!‚Äù I thought, ‚ÄúThat is going to be uncomfortable!‚Äù I put them on anyway, expecting another failed experiment in the world of pretty socks. I was completely flabbergasted to discover that not only were these socks NOT uncomfortable at all, they actually rendered my beloved shoes MORE comfortable!<br /><br />At the time I purchased these, I was breaking in some new leather flats, and putting these on with them kept them from forming the usual blisters on my heels that I have come to expect during the breaking in process while wearing them in a fashionable way. (To avoid the blisters, I had started breaking them in at home wearing gym socks with the shoe to protect my feet.) Being able to wear shoes out of the house during their breaking in is a real boon, as each pair is now instantly wearable thanks to these socks!<br /><br />After wearing these a few hours, I jumped online and purchased six more pairs in two different colors. These socks are AMAZING! I love that they have little silicone grips on the bottom as well to keep your foot from sliding around in your shoe as well as to protect you from falling on the floor if you take your shoes off and forget you are in your stocking feet.<br /><br />I wear an 8.5 shoe, and these socks fit me perfectly. If my foot was much bigger, they wouldn‚Äôt fit at all. That is something to be aware of before ordering, as I imagine if you had feet that were much smaller or much larger, you would have problems with fit. It would be nice if these socks were available in more varied sizes, as I would love to give them as gifts to female friends and family. I was fortunate enough to receive this set at a discount in exchange for my honest review, but as stated above, I bought two more sets subsequently at full price after realizing how wonderful I found the product."
5.0,"I very much like the patterns in this book, they are mostly quite simple and elegant. They also are multisized to quite large sizes which is very nice since so many patterns only will size up to about a size 16 or 18. This book goes into plus sizes. It is hard to find in the yarn shops so I was glad to find it here!! Like !!!"
5.0,My son loves these. Soft and durable.
5.0,"This was adorable on my daughter, and it will be adorable on the other children that I photograph I'm sure.  It's a very soft material, and seems sturdy enough to wash, although I have not washed it yet.  I'll update if anything goes wrong."
5.0,"I love these. They look nice and are pretty comfortable. They are not fleece on the inside but I live in the desert so I'm cool with that. The material does attract more lint though because they aren't sweat material, more polyester feel, but still comfortable. I was worried about the sizing because I wear a 12/14 but a large fit perfectly."
5.0,I took a medium I am 175 lbs
5.0,I love everything about this dress.  Gonna be buying in every color
5.0,This is the most handy item I have in my pocket--it keeps change secure and always available!
5.0,"All I can say is wow- I can't believe there are no reviews of this yet! It is light, airy, and the perfect summer outfit that you can dress up or down. I will say it is a little on the larger side. I always order one size up (or sometimes two) with Amazon because so many things come from overseas, but, I could have probably stuck with my size (Medium) and been fine. So I suggest getting your regular size, or if you are like me and are worried about the top being too small, go one size up. Other than that I absolutely love it!"
5.0,"The bags are lightweight, but strong and come in many attractive designs.  We have been using them for about three weeks now and are very happy with the purchase."
5.0,"Lovely dress, stretchy material and a long skirt. Great for tall people :)"
5.0,Love the color and fit. The material feels very nice on my skin as it shows nice contour of my body.
5.0,Beautiful luster !

5.0,Love these rings!  They are so feminine and you hardly know your wearing them.  Good quality.  I get lots of complements.  Thinking about ordering a couple more.  Service and follow up was great.

5.0,"Love the style and price! Top runs a bit big, but a great suit!"
5.0,My toddler loves wearing this and immediately commented on how soft it was. Easy for him to pull up over his nose and much easier than trying to mess with a scarf at his age.
5.0,"Very nice glasses, good quality too."
5.0,"i got a M (5'8'', 125 lbs). nice deep red, doesn't look cheap"
5.0,"I got this for my wife who LOVES our two Doxies.  Cute hat, good quality and she is very happy with it!!!"

5.0,It was the perfect gift for my sister.
5.0,"I‚Äôve used these once now for a 30 minute lap swim and they worked great! At first they were leaking but after I adjusted them a little more they worked out just fine. Easy to adjust, but I‚Äôd recommend watching the video online to properly size them prior to use."
5.0,"I had to return them only because the dumb jeweler couldn't convert them to clip ons, other than that,man these babies would be in my ears, if you have pierced ears, ORDER THESE NOW!!"
5.0,Amazing product. Love the colors
5.0,Well made...good detail.
5.0,Love these shoes!!
5.0,"It came 2 days early and I was very happy about that. It has 4 thin strings, a thicker band and one main band that holds the pendent. It is an amazing looking accessory, and it could probably fit almost any size wrist. Great product!!"
5.0,High quality. Fits a bit slimmer than the traditional boxy hoodie. Definitely recommend.
5.0,"I absolutely adore these. Not as flimsy as Carter's and those snaps on the side of neck are such a thoughtful design, otherwise my kid is always sporting a boat cut with shoulders exposed. and the design is very cute"
5.0,"I have had these for 10 years now. They still look as beautiful as the day I purchased them. They don't rust or tarnish. Very high quality pewter. I always get compliments on these. Real metal jewelry is a great brand, I have other pieces from them which have also still held up nicely after many, many years"
5.0,"Colors are great. Long on me and I'm 5'7"" but I like it that way."
5.0,So cute and true to size can't wait for my nice to grow into this dress
5.0,That real leather smell!! I love it! My husband loves it!

5.0,My 3-year-old nephew loves it.
5.0,Bought these for my wife. She absolutely loves them!
5.0,I bought this dress for a ‚Äúgoth prom‚Äù themed event. This dress fit like a dream except for the length - I had to get it altered because it was a little long (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and it dragged on the ground). Other reviews warned about this so I wasn‚Äôt surprised. Honestly this dress was perfect and people were surprised I bought this from Amazon. Picture is prior to it getting altered.
5.0,They are beautiful and worth the money
5.0,Was delivered on time in good condition & looked just like the picture. Love them!

5.0,Super cute. They look like little Adidas.
5.0,"I bought this as a decoration, but will likely use it as an evening bag. It's very pretty."

5.0,"Perfect, just what I wanted! Excellent quality!"
5.0,Bought this purse for a wedding and it was so pretty and well made.  I received so many compliments.
5.0,This is a very nice 100% leather belt. It is dark gray with an antique silver roller buckle. The outside of the belt is made of soft leather that feels like suede. It is well made and the fit is true to size.
5.0,Got great. Seem to be good quality. Soles feel non-skid
5.0,Very nice. Serviceable and lightweight
5.0,Very cute on just be very careful they're fragile one of the chains came off but I put it back together.
5.0,quality decent price

5.0,Filigree is nice. The weight of the earring is very light and no tarnishing as of yet.
5.0,Gift for my husband for Christmas and he loved this set!
5.0,The material is made of
5.0,Looks better than I thought it would.  Fun dress.
5.0,"I love these sunglasses! The day I got them in the mail I saw Snooki, from Jersey Shore wearing the rose gold ones on tv that night! She probably had a designer brand, but they were the exact same style. I get compliments on them all the time."
5.0,Exactly what I ordered and can‚Äôt beat the price $43
5.0,"Product delivered on time, as described."
5.0,Good for summer time! Really need it!
5.0,I‚Äôm usually a Large but I was iffy on the sizing since clothing from amazon can vary in sizing in my experience. But at 5‚Äô10 210 lbs the Large fits me perfect. Nice snug fit on my chest but it flows down and is loose at my stomach and waist.<br /><br />Material is comfy as well
5.0,"I love this shirt.  The material is soft, the fit is just right and it washed well, no shrinking, twisting or wrinkles."
5.0,"Totally awesome! Fit beautifully, obviously better made than what I expected, and they make be look so stunningly sexy! I'm a 32-35 waist (depending on my beer consumption) x 32 length. From experience I've learned when purchasing from the oriental market to order larger. I ordered Large and they fit perfectly."
5.0,the sunglass are good
5.0,This watch is beautiful and perfect

5.0,I use this bag for my warehouse job because they require us to have clear bags and it's big enough for me to carry small items including my phone. I love it
5.0,Purchased this as a gift. Pin looks exactly as pictured.

5.0,Fits absolutely perfect. Looks great and covers exactly what i want covered.
5.0,Perfect. Save my handd
5.0,"This is by far my favorite purse I own. I dont keep the cross body strap on it, and I leave it open so i can easily remove my stuff.. somehow managed to find it at Marshalls for $80... so big big discount from this price.. wish I could have found it in every color !! LOL i have the pink."
5.0,It‚Äôs actually prettier and looks more expensive than the photo!
5.0,"The sunglasses are cool as a party accessories, but I really love the balls, they are very enjoyable for kids to play and now I have 12 of them! üòÑ"
5.0,Very nice material very comfortable.  Bought 2 of these as a staple piece to wear under jean jacket or kimonos they are perfect for that.  Can dress up or down very versatile already washed one and hung dry still looks great!  I will get lots of use out of these.  Happy with my purchase!
5.0,Exact color and quality as shown. Great product
5.0,These have been a repurchase because they fit snug and make your booty pop

5.0,Look great !
5.0,"The case seems well made, and the interior is lined well, with a cream colored felt like material.  It is a big case.  I bought these to hold the 3D glasses that came with my TV (Sony TDG-BT500A), and they were just the right size.  I had ordered a similar one from Amazon, and while it looked almost identical, it was just a bit too small on the inside, and the interior was black.  This case was just big enough to fit the glasses and hold them without out rattling inside. The &#34;cream&#34; color inside helped in fitting the black colored glasses inside a little easier because they can only sit one way to allow the lid to close.  Overall a very good case, and an exact fit for what I needed it for."
5.0,Broke within a few short weeks.
5.0,My Mom loved it and thought it was beautiful
5.0,Easy to assemble and works perfectly on our patio next to Glider -- good quality and looks nice.
5.0,"A little big but otherwise, as pictured. Brightly colored."
5.0,Love them. Would buy another pair.
5.0,I had my glasses for more than five years. The nose supporting pads are breaking. I searched but I couldn‚Äôt find the model for my glasses. So I bought this set. They are not 100% fit but they still do the job. But the sat is a little bit more expensive than the other ones. Hope they worth the money
5.0,I really like the colors and they are super comfortable! After my favorite store quit carrying these material camis I was so upset but now I found these and I will be ordering again!
5.0,My son loves his Jacket it fits him perfectly
5.0,Nice theme and material
5.0,"very nice, kinda small for my 9 year old but perfect for my 7 year old!"
5.0,Strong and large
5.0,Nice polarized set of lenses. Optical quality is very good. I would probably knock off a half star for price.
5.0,Looks very good and is priced quite well.
5.0,"Great laces.  Good price, quick ship!"
5.0,"I am 67, 5'6, 165. I ordered a medium but it was too small. I returned it for a large and it's great. For $21, this dress is a bargain. I love that it has pockets and the two side slits up to the knee add interest, as do the ruffles on the sleeves which come to the elbow. It's plenty long. All in all, a super buy. The fabric is stretchy and I expect that it will wash well. The stripes are evenly matched. I plan to just wash it and hang to dry. It's the type of material that is easy wear, easy care, I'm pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Easily holds what I need and I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing money or my cards. Attaches to my keys and it‚Äôs always with me
5.0,True to size . And so comfy! Baby loves it
5.0,Is form fitting but love the material and love the shirt.
5.0,Gorgeous little dress made very well
5.0,"Love this! It came right away! Within 1 day. My daughter looks very cute in it. The fabirc is not super soft, but soft enough for a baby still! Great deal for the price. I really like the details of the hand mittens on the sleeves. I also like that you can roll up the legs if you are buying this a little big, so the baby can grow into it. The color is VERY BRIGHT ORANGE. It looks more red in this photo. I found ours to be ORANGE all over. The glitter details are cute. I will see how the glitter holds up in the wash. I plan to wash it inside out. Also, I like that there are two zipper pulls so that you can have easy access to the diaper. I would buy this again. I will update this review if there are any issues after a few wears. Here is my daughter in it. (I think this could be unisex since it is orange, if you are okay with your boy having a little glitter? idk)<br /><br />My daughter is 8 months. She was a preemie so she is about 14.5lbs. So she may be the size of a 6-7 month old. I bought the 7-9 month size and it is a little big, but fits perfect for her. I think the sizing would be accurate for a normal baby. I wanted it slightly large since she is now growing out of clothes faster than I can keep up with."
5.0,"What I don‚Äôt like is being asked several times to do this, I have already written a review. Once should be enough."
5.0,Super soft! Odered a size larger then I wear and fits perfectly
5.0,Very nice sunglasses that allow me to see my instrument panel when I'm driving. Get them. You'll be glad you did.
5.0,Not only good for sunglasses but anything that will fit inside that you want to protect. I put my earbuds case in one to avoid scratches.
5.0,"for great niece, she is 5 loved it"
5.0,Was the right size and looked really good on him. Got a lot of comments when he wore to the next gig.
5.0,I haven‚Äôt worn these gloves for long in the cold but they are comfortable and look very nice. I wanted something that wasn‚Äôt too heavy and these are great.
5.0,Love these boots my third and not my final pair! Light weight comfortable. Few days break in required before long hikes to avoid blisters.
5.0,Very fast shipping and product is just like the picture
5.0,Cute off the shoulder dress that can be worn with leggings. I love wearing it. It hugs my curves more than on the model and you may need a slip (slightly see through).
5.0,Love it ! I got so many compliments on this ! Just make sure to wash it before used it. Some how my nails got some stains when I wear this .  ( French mani)
5.0,"Love this hat. The terry cloth at the forehead area is comfortable & keeps me dry. Several coworkers have ordered one since I‚Äôve been wearing this. Perfect for us nurses keeping our hair out of the way. I have a lot of hair, this fits well"
5.0,I like the tight fit...lots of support...no bra nessary the shirt is very supporative
5.0,Fun and fits
5.0,I could nit find 2.25 in stores so I was glad to find these. Loved that each pair came in a case. Nice colors.
5.0,"Got this for my boyfriend as a gift for his birthday!! He loves it, especially since he already says ""Green Bay All Day"" every chance he gets and to every packer fan he sees"
5.0,Love love love this dress it fits perfect I ordered a size medium and I am 5'2  and 145 lbs perfect length for my short size
5.0,This is very nice and comfy.  I love it. Im chunky and usually dont wear dresses but this one is just right. It is just a tad on the long side tho.  It touches the ground.  Im 5 ft 6.  If you are shorter than that you might be walking on it.
5.0,"This one fits perfectly and is more adjustable than the other brand I previously ordered. Fits a 45# Lab mix just great. She is a bit on the small side physically, more narrow through her chest. This adjusted nicely for her and seems to be snug and balanced. I haven't tried loading it yet, but have tugged hard on it while she wore it and it did not slide to one side like the other."
5.0,"This was a freebie for me with something else, but my wife loves it. My guess before I got it was that it would be weird to wear and potentially tacky, but it is actually way more cunning than I anticipated, nice little accent to most any outfit. Sweet little piece that I'm glad we got! Thank you"
5.0,"Exceeded my expectations,love it. Totally recommended"
5.0,beautiful bag..feels like the softest leather ever
5.0,I used these for small candle centerpiece
5.0,Fit perfectly and of a stronger quality than I had.
5.0,"These pants are very comfortable and are sized just right.  They are thin so do not wear them in the winter without some type of base layer.  I like the sleek non-baggy look, without having the normal cargo look."
5.0,I love the way it hold my stomach in and it has a nice size pocket and elastic is good . will update after 30 days
5.0,"I love this little card sleeve. I don't use it for credit cards or any other financial-related cards--I prefer RFID protected credit card wallets. However, I have an excess of other cards that overfill my wallet--things like the triple A card, car insurance card, business cards, and appointment cards.<br /><br />I have to admit that this accessory is not essential in the normal course of things. After all, one can just shove cards and small pieces or paper anywhere, but having a beautiful, well-made, and easy to find holder, does make life easier. I love the ivory color, the soft and buttery feel of the leather, the simple design, the perfect stitching--it has a definite European understated elegance. It makes a perfect gift but is great for treating one's self to a bit of extravagance and self-indulgence.<br /><br />I also have the matching portfolio for carrying a small notebook, a pen or stylus, large receipts, and so on. The card sleeve does fit inside the portfolio, but I tend to carry it separately.<br /><br />I am attaching a photo that shows both pieces."
5.0,Worked as intended!
5.0,I give these out as halloween treats and kids love them and their parents love them too-- fun safety lights
5.0,Nice springer pillow
5.0,"I purchased size XXL as I‚Äôm size 38D bust (47 inches), hips 51 inches and wanted a top that would not be tight to the body.<br /><br />This top is perfect. Material is not see through, flows and it‚Äôs not tight at all.<br /><br />The yellow color (mustard tone) is a shown in the picture. It‚Äôs elegant and I would recommend this top."
5.0,"I am obsessed with this sweater!  I usually wear a small or medium, depending on the look I am going for, and this fit perfect.  It is definitely oversized, but not so oversized that it looks silly.  This sweater can be dressed down or worn casually."
5.0,I love this sun hat. I wear it on my husband‚Äôs sailboat. It protects against the strong sun while looking stylish.  The cord under the chin keeps it in place in the wind. Great buy!
5.0,Good quality hat. Fits as expected. Looks just like the picture.
5.0,"I like these Chunky Boots. They look like combat boots, and they‚Äôre comfortable and support your feet.  They rise to your mid-calf, and it‚Äôs especially useful how they unzip and zip to make them easy to put on or take off.  There are also laces that can adjust the fit of the boot to your leg.  The boot has a well-designed gripping sole to it.  I ordered size 8 (for a foot that varies between size 7.5 and 8 with a medium-wide foot) and the boots grip the sides of your feet comfortably (but any tighter would not be good).  There is also plenty of room for your toes, so it appears that the boots match up with standard sizing (unless you have a really wide foot).  A set of insoles came with the boots that you can slip into the boot to tighten it up if it‚Äôs too loose.<br /><br />The fabric of the boot is soft and flexible, and the inside lining of the boot is comfortable without any sharp protrusions.  The sole is securely glued on.  It‚Äôs a very light boot, which is good for walking around, but perhaps not good for longevity.  I don‚Äôt know if it will last a short or a long time, so I can‚Äôt really dock any stars from the review for possibilities.<br /><br />I received these boots for free in exchange for an honest review:  good, bad, or indifferent.  After two days of wear, I would recommend these boots to you, with the understanding that they are not really a wilderness boot but rather a comfortable fashion statement (which is an unusual‚Äîand‚Äîuseful thing all in itself!)."
5.0,As discribed.
5.0,"It's very beautiful. Only the zipper is of low quality, it seems fragile. But the coat is warm and wears very well.  Usually seen M and bought the size m, the fitting was perfect"

5.0,Great material! Doesn‚Äôt shrink When washed and fits perfectly!
5.0,"It's a really cute dress and the fabric is nicer than I expected.  It does run small.  I went by the size chart and ordered the size I normally wear, and it was uncomfortably snug.  Order at least one size up."
5.0,THESE ARE MY FAVORITE LOW BOOT STYLISH SHOES
5.0,Beautiful and great quality!!
5.0,"I love how long the robe is. and that it zips from both top and bottom.  Helps prevent zipper being ripped off bottom, as happened on my last one.  Also SO SOFT!  Only thing I had wished I'd know prior is the fact that the care instructions call for ""hand wash cold""."
5.0,My husband wore this for his Christmas party. Everyone loved it.... and it was comfortable ans cozy.
5.0,"Loving it.  great quality,  great fit., good looking. Good torso length. I am 5.81/2 tall.  Hard to get a swimsuit that doesnt pull. This one fits perfect."
5.0,Exactly as pictured! Even comes with a little baggie for the rain coat. Awesome for $8.<br /><br />Only compliant is the the first B is slightly cut off and the second B is not on the same side as the word ‚Äúbang‚Äù<br /><br />Sorry for the dirty antique mirror selfie!
5.0,"Be sure to check product dimensions before you buy it. It was too big for my liking, but it seemed to be a high quality wallet. Fast shipping and quick refund upon my return. Great customer service too!"

5.0,"Love it.  Fits great.  Material is so light and comfy.  Perfect for vacation!  I‚Äôm 32DD (Victoria Secret), 153lbs, tight size 6 in American Eagle Jeans.  Small waist, kinda bigger bootie body style.  You‚Äôll love it too! the boyfriend really likes  the peep hole for the cleavage.  Lol"

5.0,I bought these for my Father for Christmas.
5.0,Exactly as described. Good quality. Fits well.
5.0,Amazing statement necklace!

5.0,"It'a great top for my yoga practice. No complaints, happy with my purchase."
5.0,Dress was true in size and great quality!
5.0,"Where to begin...<br /><br />Lets start with I bought one just like this from a large national jewelry retailer for somewhere in the neighborhood of about $450 back in 2007. I had 30 days to return it and I did just that. $450 just seemed like a ton of money to me at the time and still does for a mens ring. In addition to that I was loosing weight and these rings can NOT be resized. Once they are made that's what they are. Can you imagine having to replace a $450 ring that fell off your finger because it doesn't fit?<br /><br />A few years later I was surfing Amazon and decided to look into mens wedding rings since I had lost a bunch of weight and my original band didn't fit any longer. After quite a bit of searching I found the &#34;Concave Tungsten&#34; ring. I couldn't beat the price and at the time I purchased it I think it was somewhere around $90. They have since come down in price.<br /><br />I love the strength and luster of the tungsten, this very ring saved my hand from being smashed about a month ago. Had I been wearing traditional gold or white gold I certainly would have had a boogered up hand. I have tried other tungsten rings and have found that no other compares with this one in comfort. This ring is completely rounded. There is not a sharp edge on it. If I could get it in a dark color I would wear one on each hand.<br /><br />As for the seller, I have yet to find a better seller anywhere. The first ring I ordered was 1 size too big. No questions asked, no hassles they worked with me to get it shipped back and they sent me a new one that fit just right. The ring size being wrong was not the sellers fault. It was mine as I thought I wore the larger size. Again this seller is great to deal with and was very helpful.<br /><br />Amazon was awesome as always."
5.0,"I would give 10 stars if possible! Durable, sturdy, claw tips allow weeding without destroying my fingernails. Recommend highly."
5.0,Such a cute dress! Good quality for the price. Can't wait to wear to Oktoberfest!
5.0,Easy to program.... easy to read

5.0,"Comfortable, can wear for long time in bright day light."
5.0,great pants and fabric. feels so good on .
5.0,Very good and comfy fit very well really recommend
5.0,"These glasses are great for the price. The frames are awesome and are better quality than the price suggest. The lens are yellow and will make you think that every day is sunny and nice. I love wearing these outside. They make me feel positive with seeing everything sunny and bright. They are narrow, but still fit me well. I enjoy wearing them."
5.0,my skin become brighter and moisture after the mask. Really love this product.
5.0,I love it; it's generously expandable and brings the glam to my black and tight dresses or tops.  It's well made with excellent material.
5.0,"This dress was so adorable I bought it for my daughter's first communion.  It looked great with a little sweater and was pleasantly surprised there were ties at the shoulders, so you could adjust to your liking and it worked great when I head to nurse my baby!"
5.0,Very satisfied with the product
5.0,"I suffer from plantar fasciitis and need extra support.  This slipper provides not only great comfort, but the support needed to alleviate the normal discomfort I experience.  This is the best slipper I have ever owned."
5.0,Fits great and looks nice.
5.0,Great purse! It fits everything I need and still has space. It is not bulky and in the way like most purses.
5.0,This is a very flattering swimsuit especially from the front and a little sexy for my mom bod lol.  I am 5 foot 5 1/2 inches 141 pounds and is 34-36 D chest. I purchased a large based on previous reviews and it fits me pretty well. from the rear view you can see a couple of my little rolls (the struggle is real) but not too bad overall. I was surprised I did not have side boob with this swimsuit and I‚Äôm very happy about that.  I took the pads that came with it out ( they just didn‚Äôt look good to me ) and will put some of my own in from another swimsuit that are more flattering or just wear it without. It fit perfect without them.  The pictures are with no pads in the chest. Oh and the bottom does not come up superhigh on the hips but it still attractive
5.0,This was a gift for my brother. I love that the keychain came in a very cute gift box with space to write something on ti. Its a very unique gift with a beautiful message. My brother loved it!
5.0,This outfit fit perfectly! After reading the reviews I decided to get a small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù at 152lbs.
5.0,My grandaughter loved it
5.0,I'm 5'3&#34; 140lbs with 36 DDD and a Medium fit me perfect. It's lightweight and I received numerous compliments at work.
5.0,"We have had the hardest time finding suits that fit my daughter. She is very much on the skinny side, so the waist is always too big. This one is amazing!"
5.0,Bought these for my husband and he loves them. Good quality and the matte finish is a nice touch. Would recommend.
5.0,"These sunglasses are noticeably heavier and feel much sturdier than many other sunglasses in this price range which are often nothing more than cheap plastic frames with low quality plastic resin lenses. In comparison, these Dollger sunglasses have an all metal frame with what seem to be decent quality lenses. These are TAC lenses which have 100% UV400 protection and are polarized to help reduce glare. They also seem to have blue light blockers which some say can help further protect your eyes.<br /><br />I used this glasses while driving on bright sunny days a few times so far and they have really worked well. The lenses did not make things look overly dark and dull like many cheap sunglasses tend to do. Everything looked clear and crisp and the polarized lenses really reduced glare and helped strain on my eyes.<br /><br />I like the fit and style of these sunglasses. They are casual and modern looking without looking or feeling cheap. They have normal size lenses that wrap around slightly which I prefer to some of the models out there with the oversized lenses that are either too round or don‚Äôt curve around at all. The hinges on these frames flex which helps provide a comfortable fit for many different head sizes. The nose pads are also adjustable to fit different size faces and are very comfortable. They kept the glasses in place without sliding down and a did not have to constantly adjust them all the time.<br /><br />These sunglasses come with a nice hard shell carrying case with an included carabiner clip that you can use to attach it to your backpack, clothing, or handbag. They also come with a cloth drawstring pouch which can be used to carry and protect the sunglasses in addition to or in place of the hard shell case. You also get a quality lens cleaning cloth and a portable keychain screwdriver in case you ever need to tighten the hinge screws. I received these sunglasses for free in exchange for testing them and providing my feedback and review."
5.0,Love it! They get here fast! They are so cute!
5.0,Purchased for players on hockey team.. Great Quality and look amazing.  I actually purchased 3 colors and they are all beautiful.  And they come in a velvet bag which makes presentation great
5.0,Very nice quality. Cold weather only!
5.0,Bar came straight I had to bend it. Other than that it‚Äôs the perfect tiny little heart nose ring.
5.0,Awesome print. Straps make it easy to adjust. Nose wire makes it stay in place. Will be buying more of these
5.0,Fit is so good.  They stay up on my little nose!!!<br />Great eye side coverage and I use them for Skate and Classic skiing.<br />Eyes not tearing as much as with other dark glasses.
5.0,ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
5.0,This vest is exactly what I needed it‚Äôs well made and fits well . I‚Äôm sure to be buying more.
5.0,Super comfortable and well made.  Purchased a few more and will do so again as the need arises!
5.0,great product Aegis the only thing I would say is get more color designs or more camo designs great product absolutely smell proof and durable really appreciate the the rubber like seal on the outside of the zipper to help trap the smell even more
5.0,The fabric is thin but not sheer and it feels nice on.  The item is well made and withstands washing without a problem.
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 135 and a medium fit perfectly
5.0,Love it!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,A pretty dress. Many compliments
5.0,"This is a great value, getting 9 pairs of earrings. They are all nice. It makes for great gifts too."
5.0,Perfect fit. Arrived early.
5.0,5 stars - fits perfectly
5.0,"I wanted something with coverage for my new mom breasts, but I was tired of wearing nothing but fabric sports bras (while comfortable, they aren't sexy at all). I wanted to feel like a woman and not a frumpy mom. I put this on and was literally in tears. For a minute, I forgot I was 36 weeks pregnant.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- support, yes even for 36E breasts without tightness or wires<br />- plastic clips for easy breastfeeding (yes, I can unclip with one hand)<br />- straps that feels like a bra (and are adjustable)<br />- easy on and off (back clips, not an over-the-head sports bra)<br />- pretty lace that is also comfortable (not scratchy yet)<br /><br />These are my first impressions, and I'm going to wear it for a while before ordering more."
5.0,great piece of jewelry for wearing around neck
5.0,My wife likes these. It's the fourth pair I've bought her. Good price.
5.0,Fits perfect and the material is good quality. I was afraid of it being cheaply made due to some of the comments but it is great! I got the Vblue... may be ordering another color!!! :)
5.0,Wear under my gym clothes
5.0,Product matches picture and seems pretty sturdy.
5.0,"The sleepwear looked fashionable and if you are smaller in statue they're worth having but they run very small in size,I had to return them"
5.0,"This dress is beautiful and well made.  Oh how I wish it fit!!! But the sizing recommendations are way off!  I usually wear a 10-12 (38-29-39), so I ordered XXL, but is WAY too big for me in the top and waist... It fits more like 14 would.  The waist band also falls below my waist.  Otherwise the dress is beautifully made, the construction, lace and tulle are good quality.  The skirt is 3 layers, a cream lining, cream dotted tulle, under black tulle.  Also, I'm 5'4"" and it falls to my ankles."
5.0,Nice-granddaughter lived it
5.0,Very Cute! I get Compliments all the time!
5.0,"The quality is good and I liked its visual side and how it operates in the sunshine, so my choose was correct."
5.0,"Really beautiful and sparkly &#34;cuff&#34; style bracelet. This bracelet could fit 6.5&#34; - 8&#34; wrists. It fits loosely while still looking like a snug cuff.  Very easy to wear, lightweight, I forget it is on.  Love wearing this with a white t-shirt and jeans. Very strong magnet. I'm going to buy a few more as gifts. And get a black one for myself."
5.0,"Super cute!  Love it!  Took awhile to get, but worth it."
5.0,"I got these for my mom for Christmas, she loves them. The true definition of ‚Äúfitting like a glove.‚Äù Very pretty!"
5.0,"I bought this for my monthly Bunco game. It lights up beautifully and fits like a very comfortable headband. The old tiara we used for the game was too tight and hurt players heads. This will be perfect. The main jewel had fallen off in transit and was loose in the bag, but I just superglued it back on. No harm no foul."
5.0,Works well. Looks great. Using on my Alta HR. Easily adjusted for optimum Heart Rate monitoring.
5.0,I put 3 stars for installation but you can get use to it
5.0,"loved the style, look and fit! üòÅ"
5.0,It‚Äôs super gooooddddd
5.0,Love this piece!
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it.  I got the pineapple design and it's very cute and colorful, just as pictured, I think.  Because it's fabric, I'd be careful of where you set it down if you are fussy about your purse bottoms getting dirty."
5.0,These goggles worked great for my boys at the pool. They are 7 and 4 and refuse to get in the water without goggles. They could see clearly in them and never complained of leakage. Even when they put them on upside down. Lol. They are also very easy to adjust and didn‚Äôt get tangled in their hair.
5.0,This dress is true to size and you still have a bit more room to breathe. It doesn't hug your curves too tightly and gives you ample room in the midsection area. I ordered the 20plus and I wear a 16w.
5.0,"This is an awesome robe for my clients! It's thick and feels expensive and it's big enough to fit most shapes. I haven't washed it, yet, but so far it's a great deal!"
5.0,"Was very surprised at the difference these glasses made at night. They fit comfortably over my regular glasses and greatly reduce the glare from oncoming headlights. Afraid they will never qualify for a glamor award, but the lenses are very clear and precise, and are a great help with night driving."
5.0,It is great to have the two extra pockets for the bag.
5.0,True to size. The band around is a bit tight but if I sized up it would be way big in other places. The color is beautiful and the length is perfect. Not sheer at all. The quality is very nice! I‚Äôm a 40DD and it was great in the bust area!
5.0,Got this as a shower gift and mother-to-be loved it and ordered it in another size as well.
5.0,"These are super cute - very retro with a bit of a modern flair.  They are oversized, though, so probably not best for smaller faces."
5.0,"I only rarely wear dresses nowadays, so if I do wear a dress I want it to be comfortable.  The KIRUNDO Women's Summer Bohemian Floral Wrap Dress is easy to wear and is flattering.  It is easy to wash and wear, not see through, and really covers all the bases for what I am looking for in a breezy, summer dress."
5.0,"Everything arrived as expected. Colors are bright, scarf has double-sided printing so it‚Äôs not backward on one side. My daughter is using this for ‚Äúinternational culture week‚Äù at school and was excited when everything arrived just in time to use it."
5.0,My daughter wore this dress to her homecoming dance. She received a lot of compliments.
5.0,A mi esposo le encanto
5.0,Very comfortable and has a nice subtle design that looks good.
5.0,"This is just to cute for words!!<br />I loved it on my little girl, she looked SO cute and my pics turned out AMAZING.<br />Fits great too!!<br />Very happy"
5.0,Great watch. Looks great. Get complements on the craftsmanship all the time.
5.0,"When I received this sweater, I was amazed at how well it is made.  It is really a quality piece at a great price.  I would not hesitate to order a sweater from this company again."
5.0,"This style of face mask is super breathable - and my kids prefer to to the traditional surgical style mask. With the open neckline it is very comfortable to wear, and the ear loops are made of the same soft lycra/jersey fabric the rest of the face/neck mask is made of.<br /><br />It's a perfect size for kids aged 3-10, and while it doesn't have an adjustable tie at the back like most adult versions, the ear loops function as a sizing tool and the extra fabric drapes in the middle, toward the neck, giving kids of all ages and head sizes adequate protection."
5.0,They fit perfectly on me. I am 5'4 and 120lbs. They are very thin which I really like because I get hot easily when working out. It's fitted but not overly tight. Overall I'm satisfied!
5.0,Love this product. Very comfortable to sleep in especially with the adjustable band
5.0,This bracelet is much more sturdy than I imagined it would be. It feels perfectly balance with the use of leather strips along with decorative string. The piece works well with most of my casual attire not to mention other casual bracelets of similar color tones. I have gotten many inquiries as to where I got this from!
5.0,"Purchased the gray and black for my 15yr old son. He loves them!! He‚Äôs about 5‚Äô10‚Äù and they hit about 5‚Äù about the knee. They look very nice on him, are comfortable, and held up very well after a few washings. The zippered side pockets are a plus, big enough for an iPhone. I would post a picture, but he‚Äôs not a fan of mom taking his picture. LOL!!"
5.0,"expensive looking umbrella, love the purple inside"
5.0,Described to feel bigger after breaking it in. these have been amazing. most comfortable and stylish slippers iv'e yet gotten to have.
5.0,"These boots are just the right thing for extremely cold weather.  Twice I was temporarily issued Extreme Cold Weather Boots (the white rubber models) in the Army in Alaska and experienced temperatures of -40 degrees Fahrenheit, yet still stayed comfortably warm.  When I left the military, I bought a pair to keep.  These also go by the names of Vapor Barrier Boots, VB Boots, Mickey Mouse Boots and Bunny Boots.<br /><br />Having semi-stiff rubber shells, they are heavy, clunky, not very flexible and not entirely comfortable to walk in, but they are designed to keep the feet warm and they do that well.  The key is to not 'overdress' with thick socks.  If you do that, you may run the risk of having your feet sweat and sweat is not good in sub-zero temperatures.  Regular wool boot socks is enough to prevent the inside rubber lining from chafing your feet.  For a little added protection, put on a pair of thin polypropelene socks first to wick away any sweat, then the wool socks.<br /><br />There is a valve built into the side to enable the wearer to equalize air temperature if necessary, i.e. in an airplane or riding a very high ski lift.  Because the insulation is supposed to be encapsulated, a reduction in outside air pressure (e.g. ascending in an airplane) can cause the boot to expand; squeezing the feet.  An increase in outside air pressure (e.g. reaching the bottom of the ski hill) can cause the insulation to crush and reduce effectiveness.  Note to the wearer:  Only open the valve when equalizing is necessary.  Leaving it open can allow moisture to get in and render the insulation ineffective.<br /><br />Even if you do not encounter extreme cold, but only sub-freezing temperatures, but with little or no body-heat-generating movement (sitting in a tree stand or duck blind comes to mind), then this is still a good idea."
5.0,Great quality and great value.
5.0,I appositely love these earrings they were smaller then they looked in the picture but other then that they are very fashionable earrings and I recommend people to buy these earring!
5.0,Very cute and good quality. My girl loves it.

5.0,I like the socks I'll be ordering more soon!
5.0,Great quality beautiful suit! Sexy!
5.0,"Very nice sterling silver blue necklace . I bought these for my wife and she loves them. She says they sit comfortably and there is no irritation. For the price you pay, they are great. Definitely a gift idea for your partner."
5.0,Wanted a small travel wallet and this fit the bill.  My driver's license and cards slide easily into the slots and the snap closure keeps them secure.  Very pleased.
5.0,"This is my third pair in four years..when you find something you like, stay with it!!"
5.0,Brought this for my mom an she loves it
5.0,"I've purchased gear from North Face, Spyder, Patagonia, and more. Every time I buy Helly-Hansen gear I like it even more. It's fits my frame well, has the right length to the shirt tail to not be too long and not too short. I like this material and feel it makes a good base layer, as well as a layer under a vest as well. I will most likely purchase another of these in another color."
5.0,This top is super cute and comfortable too! So glad I ordered it.
5.0,"Cute and working so far! I am the ONE person to always be eaten alive by bugs. I wear this biking and camping a few times, I'm happy!"
5.0,"I was traveling to Europe and I knew I needed something durable and comfortable. Well this boot didn‚Äôt let me down.  It‚Äôs not only comfortable but it‚Äôs cute too. FYI, this boot is cut short in the front, but that didn‚Äôt bother me."
5.0,"Great looking hat..got a lot of compliments on it.  Would like to find it in more colors...like the old grey, but this was GREAT for the price!"
5.0,these plugs are bluer tiger eye than i am used to even for blue tiger's eye. Also surprising for stone plugs is how well they are matched!
5.0,Es muy bueno y pasa desapercibido
5.0,Good product. Exactly as described and fast shipping
5.0,Awesome love this Puma‚Äôs
5.0,I gave my wife these and she fell in love with them. They not to thick nor to thin but just right. I can not wait until date nights again.
5.0,this top is great. its soft and not to hot i live in Louisiana and it can get pretty humid and hot down here but i was comfortable in it all day.
5.0,"Love this dress. Super flattering on any figure. Ladies, you need this for the holidays!!"
5.0,Real pretty sunglasses. Look even better in person. Good quality. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"I like the bracelet a lot but I feel like the instructions could have been better to active the product. I went to the website and created my account and put in my personal info, vital medical conditions, allergies, and medications. When I first scanned the QR Code it wouldn't bring anything up but after a few days I rescanned the QR Code and my Medwall came up with all my info. I like this better than having an engraved bracelet."
5.0,"Nice fit, Very comfortable."
5.0,I ordered a size up as recommended.  I had been looking for shorts.  These were a good price and good quality. They are very comfortable.  Easy to wash and wear.
5.0,"So nice, I bought 2 more."
5.0,"Great quality, inexpensive price"
5.0,Perfect for happy mail for my customers!
5.0,"This organizer is great. Although my co-workers often make fun of me when I take it out (and it's fully stuffed), I'm usually the one that ends up laughing as they try to untangle their cords and I'm already set up and ready to go. This was a lot larger than I thought it would be (nearly the size of my 13&#34; laptop) but it hold everything I need easily. I use this for everything from power cords to adaptors and more. I'd highly recommend this Grid-It!"
5.0,The style and color
5.0,It said somewhere that it runs large but I disagree. I actually love the way it fits though. I got a large and it fits like a medium. I still love the shirt though just watch the sizing.
5.0,Great fit. Love the style
5.0,Nothing but compliments since I got this bag. Fits a ton of stuff. Really should be 4 1/2 stars because of lack or organization internal pockets  but it is so close I gave it the 1/2 star. Durability is good so far.
5.0,I bought this when my other wallet was ruined. It is very durable and plus it's cute! It's truly amazing for someone who loves style and loves peacocks.
5.0,One size fits small
5.0,"i bought this ear muffs to take to Chicago with me for the Christmas time. I'm from Texas and I never experience cold weather here so I really wanted to be warm. I bought 2 of these for my mom and I, and they honestly saved my life over there. They are sooooo warm and cozy, I loved wearing them. They are so cute as well. It was perfect. I recommend them."
5.0,"I have several more whimsical face masks and this is the one that gets the most comments/laughs from those of use who grew on on G.I.Joe/Transformers/M.A.S.K. and other such cartoon shows. If you're going to have to wear a face mask, you might as well have fun with it.  Keep in mind you're buying a Chinese knock off and it will take at least a month to get to you once you order it."
5.0,"Very cute and great quality, love it!!"
5.0,Gift for my brother an Army vet. He loves it
5.0,This is such a pretty charm.
5.0,"Beautiful, classy, comfortable, easy to read. Looks more expensive than it is."
5.0,"These shoes are amazing! Super soft yet sturdy! They fit great for my 1 year old who is learning how to walk. They are super lite, not heavy at all. Took these on our vacation and they were a hit. My child could not take them off even if he wanted too. It has a nice rubber sole at the bottom.  I will keep buying these as his foot grows."
5.0,"I love these dresses, and my husband does, too.  On a hot busy day I wear a dress with Converse Chuck Taylors and it's really cute!"
5.0,"Fits wonderfully,  material is great, padding is great! Color is spot on!"

5.0,The cycling underwear are perfect. The fit is great. I wear them as cycling shorts. No real need to put shorts over them.
5.0,I have not worried one time since I put this ring holder on my too large ring. I had a metal ring holder on my ring placed by my jeweler and it bent and came off after a while. This type of ring holder is comfortable much more so than the metal one.
5.0,"It's a little smaller than I thought it was gonna be but not a bad thing. A very proper size for man or woman. The photo can't capture the detail of it. It's 2 sided, crystal glass one side and the other is metallic blue, and it has a thin gold line separating the two sides. It's also a sawvorski crystal, I know I didn't spell that right.  I like it and  the other in the JPG line of body candy. The other side gives it more versatility, order one, you'll like it. And it's made in USA, so mine came really quick."
5.0,seeed them right in for a great fit
5.0,"It came with a kind of coin smell, but I like it. It feels and looks like its good quality."
5.0,It fits a little bit but almost exactly right.  I think the largeness is from me being short as it is the skirt part that is sort of longer on me than it is supposed to be.
5.0,Very soft and warm!
5.0,"I LOVE these!!!!! They seem super study a lot better than the ones I have now and these were cheaper. The little pop of color is super cute and we're just as described. The case the glasses came with however was not the one in the picture, instead a black coach case which I prefer. They fit perfectly around my ears and are perfect size."
5.0,I wear cardigans for most of the year and I sort of feel naked without them in the summer. When it's too warm for a cardigan I've been substituting a lightweight kimono such as this one. I love Orchid Row's products. They always fit well and are easy to care for and look fabulous. The kimonos really dress up a plain t-shirt as well. Great buy!
5.0,Fiancee loves it. Great for lifting weights at the gym or temporary ring for working in harsh conditions.
5.0,Very comfy and soft.
5.0,Love this dress. Can be casual and comfy or dressed up. Very soft material and fits well.

5.0,"I have trouble finding bottoms that fit nicely and this were perfect.  I am 5'6, 130 pounds and bought a large."
5.0,I bought these sunglasses for my son and he loves them! The comfortable and flexible nose piece moves with him so he can wear them while he is doing anything and the heavy duty frames keep them from breaking when he is being a boy. The lenses haven‚Äôt even scratched when he has dropped them or just taken them off and left the sitting where they shouldn‚Äôt be. We love that he can do anything from everyday tasks to hunting or fishing with them on and they take the inevitable beating he gives them.<br />This is the best pair of sun glasses I have ever gotten him for a way better price! Great for a rugged outdoor experience or just hanging out with friends. I am glad I found these and will be buying more for all the sun glass wearers in my life.
5.0,Great sunglasses I drive semi so theses work great amazing fit by far best pair of sunglasses for the price
5.0,"Charm is just as I expected, beautiful üòä"
5.0,Sized a little bigger but it still works. Happy customer here.

5.0,"Perfect gift for the Beyonc√© fan in your life. Super soft material, nice and flowy, flattering. Lettering is clear and well adhered. Nice product."
5.0,Awesome sleeves.
5.0,"I have been buying this style of dress for several years.  It became like a quest!  When would I find one that actually fit?  The Asian size guides never seemed to be accurate.  The maxis barely reached mid-calf and the bust was NEVER big enough!  I am 5'7&#34; and a size 38D but 42.5 when measured according to directions for dress size.  I ordered a size XL and crossed my fingers!  IT FIT!!!  (I used the size chart on the left side among the photos.  I used my overall chest size, not my bra size.)  It's down to my ankles, just like the photo and plenty of room in the chest area. The color is not as vibrant as the photo, but the dress is beautiful yet understated.  The top irregular layer is made with eyelet material and very attractive.  I find dresses more comfortable and find polyester way too hot!  I have another quest...to find 100% Cotton clothing for summer items.  Now-a-days everything seems to be polyester.. Yes, they wrinkle easier and might take an ironing, but that pays off in terms of breathability of cotton and thus coolness.  This is 100% cotton."
5.0,Very cute ... thin fabric but good for summer.  I like it!
5.0,Arrived very quick. Surprised on quality. Very nice for the price. It is heavy and durable!
5.0,Mostly a great jacket.. Only thing is zipper is on wrong side.

5.0,"Took on winter backpacking trip all over Europe and Mediterranean. If you're using it to conceal valuables during travel abroad, BUY IT. Pocket is sturdy, fabric is soft, plenty big to loop twice or three times around, and the zipper had no problems. Stowed my cash, passport, and even phone at times and had no issues. Love this product!!!"
5.0,I like everything about this item<br /> Just the size is not marked on the outfit.

5.0,"I little short, nice color and very comfortable."
5.0,"This necklace is very pretty. The stones are a pretty color of green and sparkle in the sun or ample amount of light. The chain isn't really long. The silver is very nice, but unsure if it will tarnish over time. Overall, great necklace and worth every penny spent."
5.0,"I was so disappointed when Orthoheel changed to Vionic and therefore changed all their styles and how the shoes are made‚Ä¶ Although they unbelievably deny this. So In my search for a comparable sandal I came upon this one by Aetrex. So far my pronated feet are happpy.  Good fit, comfortable. Decent price too."

5.0,"These clip-on sunglasses are good quality, nice looking n fit well over<br />rx glasses."
5.0,"Love the color and the fabric, and the cute trim on the pocket and the collar. I don't like anything around my neck, so I cut the collar off. The top is still cute. 5""10"" 165lbs and the XL fits perfectly. Waistband on the pants is little tight, but a few more miles of walking and it should fit."

5.0,"This wouldn't fit my phone in it (Pixel XL2) but I didn't buy it to be a phone case.  I bought it to house the myriad cards that we're issued these days.  Store loyalty cards, gift cards, purchase cards, credit cards, ID, insurance cards - there's a lot to carry around and I wanted one item that would fit all of it.  VOILA!  This wallet is amazing.  I love the way it feels in my hand.  It's big, it's bulky, you're not going to get one of these into your pocket - but do you need to?<br /><br />I bought this wallet to carry in my bag with all my other stuff that I carry, so that I can have all my cards, checkbook, business cards etc. in one place.  This wallet excels at keeping me organized.  It's well laid-out, the card slots are generous so you don't have to wrestle your cards in and out.  I can't think of a single bad thing to say about it."
5.0,Love the fitting and material
5.0,Shipped on time and great quality
5.0,"I bought this product few weeks ago and so far it's holding up good. I have it hanging off my sparring bag and it's been through a car wreck. No paint chips, no lose stones, no broken pieces. The paint job on the leaves isn't perfect but it's hardly noticeable"

I own 6 pairs, and, all 6-pairs are equally appreciated and enjoyed with each wearing. They are...Aggressively Sexy!"
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this hat! The medium denim blue, curved bill (the button is the same color, too,  FYI) of the hat is about 6 1/2&#34; wide and about 2 3/4 &#34; from the middle of the front of the hat. Its a good solid & quad stitched bill.<br /><br />The dark olive green denim part of the hat is soft, and is open after the button for ponytails....not just a tiny hole, but like almost half of the hat is removed in a soft, circular shape.<br /><br />It has a brass sliding buckle to easily adjust the sizing, but it stays where you put it.<br /><br />This hat is very comfortable and keeps its size even after wearing it for several hours....I don't have to readjust it. It stays put!<br /><br />I haven't tried to wash it yet, but will update on colorfastness when that happens.<br /><br />All in all...a great comfortable hat that I can easily recommended.<br /><br />It also arrived pretty quickly, I was surprised that it showed up sooner than expected."

5.0,I loved it when it first arrived. The color was vivid. The fit was perfect. I've order this dress before in a different pattern and loved it also. I waded it like I washed cold  then hung dry. I did not want it to shrink. The color changed to a strange crinkle blue.  I haven't tried drying in the dryer yet but not loving how it turned out air drying it.

5.0,"I'm a short person with fat, flat feet, swollen ankles and truly need compression socks. I've been searching for the perfect open toe socks and think I've found them with Zeta. Although I'm returning this purchase, I'll be reordering them in the 24"" XXXL open toe socks to replace them. Totally my fault as I checked the wrong size to begin with!<br /><br />But OH how I wish I could speak to their designers! If I could, I'd ask them to make a 22"" or even a 20"" XXXL open toe socks with about a little more give at the top of the socks as I'm tired of how they cut into my legs...they're painful after I take them off, because the socks were tight. But, I put them on almost daily because while they're on, they make my legs and ankles feel good!<br /><br />Great product, for edema... very well made, but could be better for short legged folks like me!<br /><br />Thanks for asking!"

5.0,"This works great for the commemorative coin that was done for my high school that closed 10 years ago & then torn down early last year instead of saved for the historical value. It was easy to install the coin & it seems like it is sturdy.

5.0,"Finally found one that fit well and look cool.<br />i have tried a lot of version, but not one fit my glasses because i have a big head. .<br />this one is big enough and doesn't look bulky.

5.0,Nice product. Fit well. Better than expected and comfortable
5.0,"Reliable 4R36 movement. Hacks and winds. 100m water resistance, which is more than enough unless you scuba. Great and esteemed brand. Day-date function. Matte black dial. LumiBrite. 120 click bezel. For around $200, a great collectible and every day watch."
5.0,"Love these!! Great fabric, had held up well in the wash."
5.0,"Purchased for my teen daughter for Christmas.  Pic looks like the leather is dark pink.  No it is red red.  Bonus, her favorite color.  Great value and appears to be well made (Haven't worn yet)."

5.0,The mermaid came out exactly as shown in the picture and wasn't hard to unscrew. This was good purchase on my end. Will definitely be buying again.
5.0,"I received my package just before hosting a D&D game online. After 3 hours my eyes are usually giving me a slight headache but with these glasses there were no issues. I was not even tired. I have one pair in my backpack for work and the +1 really helps me with spreadsheets. So nice to work all day and not have the tired eye syndrome I usually have.<br /><br />In the evening I use my smartphone to catch up on social media and text. Again, no eye strain and I am ready to go when I get done.  Yep, second pair goes by my chair.<br /><br />The third pair was claimed by my wife and she is in love with them. She has been using her Kindle twice as much now that she has the glasses."
5.0,Love this dress Im tall and it falls perfectly.
5.0,This was the perfect size bag for carrying my bathing suit and towel for swim lessons. The fact that it was water proof is why i bought it so i could put my wet stuff in it without worrying it would get ruined<br />Love it!!
5.0,"This wig feels different from wigs I normally purchase, but it's still very nice! Was originally planning on cosplaying Juvia Locksar from Fairy Tail with this wig, but the color is a little dark for her. I'm now planning on using it for a Queen Dedede cosplay, because the color is definitely perfect for that. I've worn it to raves too just because I like how it looks so much. I have yet to wash it yet though, which I am a little hesitant about because the synthetic material feels so different from other wigs, but I have faith it will be fine."
5.0,"Oh Wow This is Amazing....!  The color...in the picture doesn't do it justice it is one of the most amazing colors in it's spectrum. Weight is excellent...it'll be warm when its cold & cool when its warm.  With this type of material you can be one whom is quite active while sleeping & not be forced awake because the cotton wear has caused the sheets, blankets to be taken up w/you.  It's one of the aspects I absolutely cannot tolerate.  I like to move..turn over...etc w/out fighting to get the covers off of me. I wish I had this available when I was a kid..!  The fit is as I expected & I really love th e pocket features in the paints.  I'm bit on functional clothing & my big pet peeve is...there has to be pockets either top &/or bottoms.  W/the pockets in the pants gives this outfit that luxurious lounge wear rich feel.  Just something about pockets in the pants that has an automatic sensation of being comfy...relaxed...cool & serene.  YIMANIE financial transaction, shipping & product 5 Star Trustworthy & an excellent Business Partnership with Amazon.  Highly recommend & absolutely will be buying more from them...!!  thank you so much yimanie..!"
5.0,"Wanted something cute and dainty for everyday wear, I found it with this ring üòç its thin and lightweight! The hearts around the band are barely there but you can definitely tell they are hearts! Looks fabulous worn ‚ú®üíì"
5.0,Medium is my range of a perfect fit.

5.0,"Finally a shirt that is sized correctly, and it fits great"
5.0,Fits great has a nice feel and i bought it in two different colors i liked it so much
5.0,"Always a little scary buying clothes online, this purchase was spot on!<br /><br />I'm 5'11 and slender, I purchased the Large and it's perfect!  The dress hits me about the top of my feet, the material is soft and moves with you.  I was worried it would make me look like a large box, but it does not!"
5.0,These with the matching jacket will keep you dry. It doesn't soak up the water or leak anywhere. I just found this brand recently and will continue to shop them.
5.0,I love these socks!! I already have two pair and got some for my daughters for Christmas. They are super warm and soft and wash up really nice.
5.0,"Wife loves it, Christmas gift for her."
5.0,I‚Äôm really short so these were a little long (5‚Äô2‚Äù and they had to be pulled above my belly button to fit length-wise). I love all of Grace Karin‚Äôs clothing. I just haven‚Äôt found the right size just yet. I wear a 6 pant and dress and weigh about 125. I ordered a large pant and they fit size wise just too long
5.0,"The material is good quality, it looks exactly like the photo. Its super cute and fits perfectly."
5.0,"Gorgeous color, just like photograph.  Well made too."
5.0,It's for a give for my sister she love it.

5.0,"I wore this on a boatride and oh boy everyone was complimenting me on my necklace, I‚Äôm looking for more styles"
5.0,"There great, it was what I was looking for, for the right price, thank you, I like them a lot."
5.0,Muy excelente
5.0,I sit at a desk most of the day and need to wear compression socks.  These do the job and my swelling is basically non-existent by the end of the day.  they also look great with lots of fun color options.
5.0,Came quickly; fits well...always best to measure (in mm) to make sure the band fits correctly.  Very comfortable.
5.0,"They are the perfect length and the quality is just right. Not too thick, not too thin but they feel great and our son loves them."
5.0,"Super comfortable, love the high waist! I ordered a size 3. They are a tad too long, but not terrible!"

5.0,Sweet!
5.0,"Gift for daughters birthday. Very pretty, not cheap looking, resemble designer brand. Good purchase"
5.0,This bag was just the best. I wished it was back with sale price. It would be well worth a second one.
5.0,Little on small end
5.0,"These slippers do run very small, but I have nothing but praise for the company and its customer service. They immediately responded to my dissatisfaction about the size, and sent out a new pair. The new pair arrived today, and my daughter loves them! She's so very happy with them and hasn't taken them off! She says they are very comfy. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5.0,"This robe is a little large, but I like the weight,color, snap closing, sleeve length,and length. I usually wear an 8 or 10 and was undecided on medium or small."
5.0,Quick delivery for when my daughter really needed this. Thank you.
5.0,My daughter loves her new shirts . They run a little small so I would get one size up.

5.0,Love them even after 6 washing.
5.0,I love this hat. Very soft and comfy
5.0,These are amazing.  The best I have ever owned.  I usually hated wearing sunglasses but these do not hinder my vision.
5.0,"I love this sweater! For the price, I think it‚Äôs very nice quality- really I could see it being worth much more. I ordered the XL and I have room but it‚Äôs not too big. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù with a 38ddd chest. I also love how the hem is lower in the back. I think I‚Äôm gonna order the burgundy one next :)"
5.0,My daughter loves this. She is three and wears it all the time. It's a nice looking watch.
5.0,Cute and good quality especially for the price.
5.0,Challenging to put on but it's been great. Absolutely zero issues with this band.
5.0,Love hocus pocus and love this shirt
5.0,Easy to clip on over my prescription glasses and work great.
5.0,Really cute on me - and cute at age 73 never happens anymore.
5.0,"I used these to replace the curly elastic in the visors I like to wear, not in shoes. They worked perfectly for that purpose."
5.0,My son was asking to get his ears pierced and since he's a little to young for that we settled on stick on earrings. He loves them. They are bright colors and shiny. The best part is that they stick really well. These are not the same stickers I had as a kid. He wore his first pair for a day and a half and his second lasted all day at school. I would buy these again.
5.0,very well made and good-looking and soft&#62;.
5.0,Got this for a gift and it was beautiful.
5.0,very well made but the first day I wore them they split in the seam on one leg.. I just sewed it right up... the fabric is very soft and durable

5.0,"Love this shirt that I wear it so much. Lol I bought red white and black. I will be buying more colors and another black cause it‚Äôs so convenient. It‚Äôs material is soft cotton and very stretchy. Keep you cool. Not too thick not too thin. Goes with any bottoms well (casual or business). The mock neck is cute and wear for any weather, even through a jacket over."
5.0,These earring are so cute and comfortable.
5.0,Great for wearing around the house!
5.0,This hat makes me feel cute.
5.0,Love them‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,"I was surprised, after seeing the picture, that I liked these colors as much as I did. Much brighter and the fit is perfect. I wear a medium and bought a medium."
5.0,"Love it, better quality then I thought it would be."
5.0,"Love it!!  Exactly what I wanted, long enough to cover the &#34;rear&#34;, short enough to not be annoyingly in the way, and thin enough so I don't sweat!  Getting old blows....but great jacket!!"
5.0,"This dress is so comfortable.  Length is just right (i'm 5'5""), not dragging on the floor.  Love the pockets too!"
5.0,"Cannot recommend this enough. Fits an impossible amount of stuff‚ÄîI‚Äôm shocked every day. Probably will not fit a laptop :( Fantastic for college, super water resistant, and color is vibrant. :) I was having a bad day and this little bag said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay bridget, i know things can be hard sometimes, but you work hard and it shows. i‚Äôve always got your back.‚Äù How sweet!"
5.0,Great product. Warm and helps during the cold weather. Looks fashionable too.
5.0,"So takes me back to first glasses, love the retro look and two tone color in black brown."
5.0,super comfortable. Good quality.
5.0,I love this necklace. I bought the 16&#34; to hang higher around my neck. I don't know how this will hang at a longer length. I have a lot of pendents and this handles them beautifully. It's rigid. Not a chain. I buy in diff dementions such as 1.25mm and 2mm. For there strength and to accommodate the size of my bails on my pendents. I also buy as gifts. Cause when I but pendents as gifts. I usually can stand the cheap chains that come with them. So for an extra 30 bucks or so. I buy these.
5.0,Very pretty and comfy.  Note runs a tad on the large size. Washes really well!
5.0,Girly basic crop. Looks good with jeans
5.0,"Finally! A perfect length dress. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and have a hard time with dress lengths. This dress falls right above my knees. It is comfortable, flattering, and the peachy/pink is pretty. The color matched the picture perfectly. The fabric soft and can be dressed up or down depending on the shoes."
5.0,Ideal for summer hot days! Beautiful!
5.0,"Bright colors, perfectly finished, stretchy but  not binding, lightweight, and so very cute!"
5.0,Nice tie. Gift for a poker player
5.0,"The best seamless leggings. Well made, sturdy, not to thick. Perfect for weight lifting. I will definitely be buying more."
5.0,"Customer service. One piece arrived with cracked corner, immediately took care of it. Luggage is really light weight and received many compliments."
5.0,My 13 yr old son loves them. Says the anti-fog works.
5.0,IT WAS LOVELY. PERFECT FIT.
5.0,"This dress is breathable, not too short, and I get tons of compliments, every time I wear it."
5.0,"Form fitting, but comfortable. Great for wearing in the privacy of your house for sleeping, lounging, or yoga. The fabric has some cool colors beside being soft, stretchy, and breathable. Crotch area is compartmented, but not too tight under normal conditions. I wear a 30&#34; inseam, these look 32 or 34 length. 32&#34; waist is a good fit. I wore them under jeans and would consider them a light thermal."
5.0,I‚Äôm a drag Queen and this is good
5.0,These are soft and not too baggy for pajama pants. Gave them to my husband for a Christmas gift and the smile on his face was perfect:)
5.0,Super comfortable and cute! Not very warm but very cute on!
5.0,A little less heavy weight than I had hoped.
5.0,Beautiful pattern and they are so comfortable. I love them

5.0,[[VIDEOID:80503640b04ed522f396b0be5e48ad9e]] es encantador perfecto para cualquier fiesta a mis invitados les encanto
5.0,"These are really soft, well-fitting pants with wonderful zipper pockets. They're easy to wash and dry, and also easy to dress up or down. I'm planning to wear them out to dinner tonight with friends, and they look great tucked into a pair of my black/purple cowboy boots. I love them!"
5.0,"I got one of these jackets from my work and I F'n ruined it over time, but loved it so much I came to Amazon and hunted it down. Really a great jacket for the price. Not sure what temp it would be good down to, in the 20's Fahrenheit its always been warm enough."
5.0,"I wear mostly small and some X-small. I had to go with a large. Its great, I wanted a sun shirt with a full zipper, not black (too hot) and not all white. I find its tough to put on and take off wet sun shirts and it's easier to regulate your body temp with shirts that have zippers. I whitewater raft, kayak and sail and I can wear it unzipped under the life jackets to help regulate. I also don't like pull clothing over my head while balancing in a sea kayak. As far as colors go, yes white get dirty but I get overheated in dark colors.<br />I took the cup out."
5.0,I just love this ring.
5.0,Great readers! Excellent quality!  Nice case!  Well worth it.
5.0,I have a traditional wallet that I've had for over 5 years now and I have so much stuff in it that it looks like a miniature briefcase.  I needed something new to give a different kind of look and Card Blocr was a perfect fit.  I went with the red and black because of my alma mater (GO BEARCATS!) which it almost matches their exact red.<br /><br />This a great wallet for everyday life bringing only the things I use on a weekly basis.  I will leave a photo on how it looks.  I can't believe for this kind of price I got this nice of a wallet.<br /><br />I would recommend buying this wallet if you need one or if you are just looking for a nice gift.
5.0,Love it. Excellent transaction. Highly recommended
5.0,Works great and was easy to install.
5.0,"Love these, are exactly what they should be.  Used as a liner for snowboarding, touchscreen works great."
5.0,"I had previously bought two other leather straps, from another brand, both had costed almost double the price of this one from WOCCI.<br />Given the price I paid, I was expecting a average product, but I MUST SAY WOCCI HAS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.<br />Besides the tool to remove and replace straps, the product seems to be of very good quality.<br /><br />I bought the black and red one, which definitely looks nice and from a small distance, it doesn‚Äôt even seem rubber, which makes it perfect for either casual or more formal occasions."
5.0,"Accurate sizing, comfortable to wear all day and really enjoyed having the front pouch lined with fabric to keep your hands warm. Great gear!"
5.0,"I purchased this for my Microbiologist wife, and she loves this.  To many folks, this will just look like an average necklace, but she has received many compliments from her colleagues and likes showing the necklace off to them!!!"
5.0,"Love the size of the stone,  the post is a bit long but  adjusting to it"
5.0,Perfect . Thank u
5.0,I ordered this in a size up and I‚Äôm glad I did. It runs very small. But the fabric has a nice subtle texture and it‚Äôs very comfortable. Glad I got two!
5.0,im using this for a halloween costume (haha mikey from tmnt) and tbh i don‚Äôt even wanna alter it anymore it‚Äôs literally so soft and the fabric is actually so nice. 10/10 will be buying another one like ong it‚Äôs so fire
5.0,"Very comfortable!  Huge improvement over my old athletic socks.  Will only buy wool socks from this point forward.  These are soft, hold their shape, and keep my feet cooler/warmer than others I've worn.  No more cotton, poly blend socks for me!"
5.0,These are great! I bought them for my 16 year old son. They are great and fit his size 12 foot well.
5.0,Love them. Almost like the real thing! But better
5.0,Good bagpack but needs more cushion
5.0,Great value for the 5 pack.  Super light material.
5.0,"As promised, arrived quickly. Fit fine. I had lost the nosepiece but switching out the earsocks provided a like new pair of sunglasses."
5.0,"These shoes are made from man-made materials & these shoes do have an aroma right out of the box, so I suggest to let them air out a bit before wearing.. The colour is every bit as bright as the photo shows. These are NOT hiking shoes, but the wedge is nice for a night out on the town. I do like to dance so I typically add a nice gel insert- babies my feet perfectly that way. The imprint on these is wicked nice & subtle in contrast to the colour."
5.0,Great look not to snugg  look just like picture
5.0,This shirt is excellent quality. The embroidery is perfect. My husband loved the shirt.
5.0,Got these for my 82 year old dad. He loves them & says they don‚Äôt slip or move.
5.0,Excellent pattern placement. The tie sits well with most shirts. Looks great with full Windsor or half Windsor.
5.0,"We use these hydration packs for our school fitness team and have for years. Not a camelbak by any means, but you aren't paying camelbak prices. Holds up well for what we need it do."
5.0,Good quality very useful for kids
5.0,They're fabulous!
5.0,"Works well, Second one I've bought since someone cracked the other one we had!"
5.0,"Seller badgered the living daylights out of me for a review but we hadn't opened them for Christmas yet, so hadn't tried them out. Now that we have, they are GREAT. Easy to use and thd hook that sits against thd wood is soft, won't scratch. Seller sent them quickly and product is as described! :)"
5.0,She loved her socks
5.0,"... I think they could have skipped the leather bag, the drawer box and all the cardboard inserts and charged five dollars less."
5.0,"Nice material , great price . Brought for my son who is 5‚Äô7 175 pounds , size small .  Will buy again"
5.0,Very cute and huge! Just what I needed for my costume.
5.0,"love it, & great price!!"
5.0,Love the green and elastic waist with the ruffles
5.0,Love this blouse so much - the price is amazing!!!  Really nice casual Friday in the office blouse.  Cool and comfortable in summer.  I ordered another in another color
5.0,This is a great dress. Fits perfectly. There is some stretch to the fabric. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù‚Äù and weigh 208. I ordered both a L and XL. The large fits me best. The XL was too long for me. I have a tummy and large hips. This dress is very flattering on my pear shape. I have this dress in 3 patterns. I love it.
5.0,Very Warm
5.0,"Wallet, charger, mask, hand sanitizer, phone, keys. Easily stored."
5.0,Comfy for around the house.  I am still wearing these and another pair I bought.

5.0,So glad I bought this!  I love wearing it and have gotten compliments.
5.0,Purchased for my son and he loves then. Durable so I know they will last a while
5.0,"I bought this as an interim mask for the current pandemic, until a more robust one arrives.  It fits well and looks great.  Much more colorful than other masks out there.  Stay safe."
5.0,"Great quality, looks like the picture, was delivered really fast and feels good while wearing!!!"
5.0,"I am 5ft 11 a tall woman and this dress fits superbly. It fits just a little above my knee, but that is great because this dress swings. The material stretches a little which makes it great for accommodation. This dress was worth the money. I have been shopping on line recently a lot, and this is one of my best buy. For a tall girl the bodice fits just right which is a rarity for tall women. I bought the black and it was a hit."
5.0,"I usually have difficulty purchasing hats as I have a larger head and I can say, IT FITS PERFECT!  I live in Minnesota and it just keeps getting colder and colder every winter but this hat keeps my head super warm.  Love it!"
5.0,"Love this comfy, sexy onsie! I'm 170 lbs, 5'6&#34;, 36F bra size and I got the medium because other reviews said they run a bit big. It fits me perfectly! It's awesome for lounging around the house in, and something different for my husband to look at than the normal leggings and t shirt ;)"
5.0,I like the individual packaging to keep from getting damaged or twisted. I like the look of every piece. Great gift idea. Versatile pieces. Good workmanship for the value.
5.0,My baby is on the chubby side and it is hard to find good fitting cloths for her. I love pureborn which fits well on her! Nice quality is a big plus too!
5.0,He loves these
5.0,These came in the other day and they are very easy to put on and they look great. Definitely recommend!
5.0,Got this about a month ago and I really like it. I have a thick wrist so finding something that fits without having to be all the way loosened. The texture is very nice and I like the clean look of this braid. It is sturdy yet still has a good amount of stretch to it. Durable and looks good.
5.0,"Absolutely love this thick, chunky, warm, so cozy sweater ‚ù§Ô∏è Ordering another!!"
5.0,Wore these when they arrived and they look cool. They're easy to put on and take off. Love them.
5.0,Bought it for my 93 year old mom.  Face is legible and she loves it!
5.0,"I like a smaller bike chain as opposed to big ,heavy bulky ones. This is the perfect size.<br />Unique non-traditional design."
5.0,"I honestly did not expect the charm to be quite big, it's very cute nonetheless. Love how soft it is and the quality is great! Would highly recommend ‚ô°"
5.0,"This is so much better than the cheap, crummy case that came with my expensive glasses. It's pretty. The outside of the case is soft and smooth, and it comes with a cleaning cloth and eyeglass repair tool."
5.0,Beautiful COACH Handbag.
5.0,"but, oh boy, you put it on and it is a fabulous garment and very elegant! The exterior of the piece is just slightly scratchy but it doesn't seem to feel that way on the inside. We'll see how it works out. It fit very well, as I am at the bigger end of a large size. I ordered the large and it fits perfectly so for someone less broad shouldered or small chested it may fit a little droopy up top - but it's a perfect fit on me. I'll post a pic when I wear it.<br /><br />Update: picture posted. Note, my normal dress size is a 10/12 in U.S. womens' and I ordered a large.<br />Update 2.25.19: I've noticed the other reviews on this item are very low. I'm not sure if people are delusional about their actual body size or want a different fit than what the dress is designed for. This dress is very elegant and classy. it is not designed to fit like a bodycon. While the material is thin, it is not see through. The material does ""feel"" a little cheap but it doesn't look cheap when you're wearing it. Only trust reviews that post a picture b/c people have different expectations and definitions. Some might say order a size up because they think they are a size smaller but they really aren't. Or they may say order a size down because they like their clothes to fit skin tight. Overall, I would say if you are attending a formal event, this dress will serve you well."

5.0,"This dress is so soft! I'm 5'5"" and the length is at my feet but not to the point that I'm tripping on it. It's got some weight to the fabric so it's not a good option for the middle of summer. It's best on a cool summer day or Fall days. The colors are rich and bright."

5.0,"The hat is sturdy, appears to be well-made... The coolest part is what the picture doesn't show. Underneath the bill is the high alert graphic from the first game (in Japanese). Awesome detail! The only thing is that it doesn't fit too snugly to my head, but I've only had it for a few days. I'm sure it'll break in at some point."

5.0,"I refuse to drop 150+ dollars on doc martens. I‚Äôm really pleased with these. Super comfy, and there is room for the insoles I put in myself. Good sole for not slipping on snow. I just love them. Can‚Äôt speak to longevity since I haven‚Äôt had them for a long time, but overall, they‚Äôre keepers!"
5.0,Great fit! Over all great design and stitching. I ended up going a different color for my bridesmaid and not needed anymore.  The company was amazing with the purchase.

They are different from your average brown booties.<br />-I am a size 7 w/ wide feet and the 7s for this boot fit true to size! Just like the other Ugg boots I have.<br />-Only strife is that they are a bit longer at the toe box but thats the style.<br />-No Ugg logo on the back of the boots. Leather strap attached to zipper.<br />-The gold lining is good quality and really stands out.
5.0,The product came to me just as described. Them material is soft and sturdy.  Usually the shoulders wear out in beaters but these are thick and there is no stitching at the top of the shoulder.

5.0,Love this sweater. It's nice feeling and looking. I bought a few in different colors.
5.0,My daughter wore the dress to homecoming. It fit her perfectly and didnt fit tight at all. The length was perfect because it wasnt short and the craftsmanship of the dress made her look stunning dispite the simplicity of the dress. The cloth is very comfortable as well. Definitely worth the price!!!
5.0,My duater loves them
5.0,"I bought this to match the Shadowline Twilight Wrap Robe, and it makes a beautiful set.  The purple is a rich lilac color, not too pale or too bold.  I am 5&#34;3&#34; and bought a small,  which is generous enough for comfortable sleeping but not too big.  Fabric & workmanship are high quality."
5.0,"I love the quality and workmanship of the earrings, especially the tight and secure clasps!! :)"

5.0,"A very durable work boot with a nice soft cushioned sole. The leather upper is very thick, as I wanted it to be, and has broken in nicely with only 20 or so miles on them. There is a sewn welt into a very soft mid sole, and a limited slip out sole on the bottom. I work in the freezer section of a warehouse and I haven't had any issues slipping and sliding. I can't tell you if they were waterproof out of the box because I oiled mine before using, but I can say with just one oiling, I haven't had any snow or mud puddles slow me down. I purchased the wides because I also wear padded boot socks, and they fit similar to when I wear my Adidas with regular socks.<br /><br />They only very small drawback so far is the weight. You know you have them on compared to some of the hiking boots that I was wearing before. I can fully adapt to the weight if they last longer than the 4 to 6 months I was getting with those lighter, lesser made boots!"
5.0,"I love these Gucci shades. These are my favorite aviators, simple and light weight and classy."
5.0,They were a little small but no worries I have a daughter that can fit into them so it wasn't a complete blow.
5.0,So comfy and soft
5.0,"I am really suprised with the look, fit, and quality of these for the price. The arms open nice and slow and feel strong and not cheap and flimsy. The feel while they're on is just great. I really like the blue lenses with the silver frames. For the price and quality, just get a pair and you will be glad you did."
5.0,VERY nice bag! Excellent quality! Very roomy! Would recommend.
5.0,North face comes through again.  Never disappointed with north face products

5.0,I love my new hat!! It‚Äôs comfortable and stylish! Can‚Äôt wait to wear it on my beach trip next month!!
5.0,These were my daughter's favorite pair of shoes until she grew out of them. Very cute but I do wish they snapped shut instead of having to thread the sides through.
5.0,"I personally loveee these tank tops! They‚Äôre perfect for working out, just lounging around in, and to wear with yoga pants and blue jean jacket ‚ù§Ô∏è<br />I have a black, grey, white, blue, red and bright yellow üòç"

5.0,I love it!!!!! Its usually hard for me to find rings that are in my size and have skulls but that are also feminine. I really love skulls and didn't want to buy a biker ring and this ring reached every expectation.
5.0,Comfy! Ordered more colors!
5.0,Great quality versus price! Beautiful with formal attire.
5.0,Quality material. Good fit. Just wish it had pockets
5.0,Love this dress. Comfy fabric
5.0,powerful
5.0,"Order a couple of sizes bigger than you are.<br /><br />Probably most people can‚Äôt pull it off using them as swimming trunks, they are exceptional underwear.<br />They stay in place. They don‚Äôt ride up or slip down.<br />My new favorite.<br />A pouch on the front would make these even better."
5.0,"Fabric is thick and durable, feels great, however about 2 inches of seam came undone at the lowest part of the zipper, the zipper separated from the fabric. I can sew, no big deal. It stretches some but order according to the sizing chart. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 180lbs, ordered an XL and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />I bought this thinking the white parts would glow under a black light for a glow party, people who saw me wear it in regular light also were convinced the white parts would glow, nothing about this suit glows. In order to make it glow, fluorescent fabric paint must be added."
5.0,This shirt is well made and it looks good. Its fit was too small so I returned it for a large over the medium. A very good buy.
5.0,"I love this!  I put my son's name, birthday date, and date of departure for Heaven on the back.  I put it on a necklace chain and wear it every day.  My daughter loves it so much that we found one that says ""Brother"" and ordered it for her.  I have not put any of his ashes in it yet.  Not sure I ever will.  But the three pieces together look great together as a necklace.  Highly recommend."
5.0,"I didn't use the shoes since they were a bit tight and I had to replace them for a larger size, but they are precisely as described, appear well made, lightweight and I'll be wearing them during the 2017 Tour de France as I ride into Paris."
5.0,"I had to take a trip using only tote style bags and looked for something to compartmentalize my belongings.<br /><br />These worked so well, I'll use them now every time I travel. Fold flat, sturdy construction and strong zippers.<br /><br />Nice variety of sizes for the price- really like that the compartments have a mesh top so I can see what's in them."
5.0,"I absolutely love this sweater. The color is so beautiful. I do suggest ordering a size larger than you normally would. I ordered 2 sizes up and it fits great. The sweater itself is very nice. Well made, stitching is great. The weight of the sweat is heavier than I expected which works nice since other cardigans that I have purchased were pretty thin and just didn't keep me warm on a cool day. The qualify of this sweater is much better than I was hoping for. I ordered the aqua color, and it is a beautiful color. I think I might have to order some other colors now. After hand washing as suggested, and laid flat to dry, The fit is still just as nice. I do suggest that when you lay it to dry try not to have it stretched out, you want to keep it to your fit. I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review."
5.0,"I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review, so here you go:<br /><br />I've never really liked masks for any reason, but this one looks very good, and is very comfortable.<br />I really like the style, it's subtly flamboyant, but not garish.<br /><br />It's pretty cool."
5.0,"I""m a well built/in shape 42 and this thing fits just perfect.  It's not too tight but conforms perfectly to the torso.  I'm 5'9"" 190# and it's perfect.  I would not even try to shrink this though with this in mind."
5.0,"I like these little peace signs even though they aren't quite accurate, but then I'm old enough to remember the original.  I have used several of them for earrings and on necklaces.  They're about a 1/2&#34; in diameter.  Workmanship is good - they are well finished and polished.  I will order them again as needed."
5.0,"Just perfect! I love it, i bought it for our vacations at Cancun. I ordered the L size it was just perfect"
5.0,"Doses what a purse is supposed to do.  Carries all the necessities...and it's hand-free and looks well, too."
5.0,I love love love this top! It is very forgiving ad it hides the tummy well-  Love the color and style!
5.0,This product was great. Going to use it for my sisters tea party baby shower
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these leggings! They‚Äôre really thick, definitely not see-through at all, super soft, and really comfortable! Awesome value for the price!"

5.0,Sister purchase for wedding. Absolutely beautiful and well made
5.0,Gave as a gift and she really liked it
5.0,"It you use the Stabilicers Sport, you must buy these. Walking the dog on the daily New England sidewalks, the replaceable cleats wear down pretty fast. If you let the cleat screws wear down too far, there's little choice but to replace the entire Sport Cleat. I check mine weekly and rotate and/or replace them as needed."
5.0,excellent service and item.
5.0,I am very pleased to say that I'm happy with this rosary. It will look great on my altar with all my other religious trinkets. I will recommend it to all my friends.

5.0,This has plenty of room for cards and it's very easy to open and close.  I keep it in my very small purse and have no problem with it at all.
5.0,Beautiful!! Colors are bright and the fit is great.
5.0,My daughter LOVES this leotard. Its a phenomenal price and fits her beautifully.

The leotard covers well doesn't run or ride up in any way, I would like to also state that as per my daughter she stated it doesn't itch at all."
5.0,Perfect for cool weather
5.0,This is my second Vera Bradley hipster. It is roomy for a smaller bag.
5.0,I like using this product a lot. Since Covid came my kid has had to use electronics a lot and complains of headaches. These glasses worked for him and I would recommend this product.
5.0,"It's only been a week, but I am very happy with my card cubby.  I bought it to keep track of about 10 gift cards I had with small balances on them-but I am keeping everything in it, including my license.  I've already used the balance of a gift card I've been carrying around for 3 years!  Keeps everything organized and easy to find!"
5.0,Super comfortable and waist slimming! My all time favorite leggings.
5.0,Exactly as the picture-fits perfectly.  Hat is very warm.
5.0,Shipping was excellent and fast. It was well packaged and is a great quality tie. Would highly recommend
5.0,"It definitely runs a little small and unlike every other Timeson shirt I own, this one has zero give. My boobs make a uni-boob in this thing, not flattering. I've been working out a lot lately, so I am going to hold on to this in hopes that my boobs start to shrink up. Short of that, there's always cellophane and tape, right? (JK, seriously, I'll probably gift it to my sister)<br /><br />But, despite everything above, it still earned 5 stars because: the sizing was probably my fault, the material is amazing, the print is beautiful, it's exactly as described."

5.0,These were very beautifully designed and wear very well through my gauges. i absolutely loved them
5.0,Very Cute and made well
5.0,Bought these for my wife to celebrate our anniversary.  She LOVES them!  Beautiful and made correctly with knots between each pearl.  The necklace does have some weight to it with all the pearls.  100 inches is a lot of pearls.Even with the weight my wife loves the length.
5.0,"I love the dress, I'm usually a small but it fits snug. I would suggest going up a size."
5.0,The mask fit my child well and happy with pruches.

5.0,This is a beautiful piece if jewelry.  I have the cobalt and it's a lovely design.<br />It's looks very expensive and the cost is very reasonable.
5.0,Great quality. Washes well. Any true Floyd fan would love this..
5.0,"I bought this for my daughters golden 25th birthday. She is 5-8, about 135 lbs.  I fit her perfectly.  It has a little give in the fabric. Very Cute!"
5.0,The clasp is somewhat hard to get hooked but once it is on it looks great.  First necklace I've ever had that stays in place all day.  Most necklaces you have to check that the clasp has not moved to the front.
5.0,Better than expected.
5.0,great price for what you are getting.
5.0,"I didn't purchase this watch from Amazon but I do own it! And I love it! It's bit on the small and lean side so if you're into a big watch, then one is not for you! The little piece that holds the watch band in place broke in mine because it is plastic after a year and I have been so sad. But I am happy to see that Amazon is selling this watch, so I am going to get one for my dad and see if I can get a replacement holder for the wristband for myself.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a very basic but durable watch, in my opinion!"

5.0,Beautiful! Such a flattering dress!
5.0,"Very cute owl, I like it haha"
5.0,Waiting to order another pair!!
5.0,"Prompt arrival in good packaging. Great idea on a belt you can trim, finally got one that fits me right. Leather is really nice, soft but also sturdy. It is very attractive as well. My only gripe would be that the punch tool was a little hard to use, but because of the design the hole doesn't have to be attractive and I ended up getting through. Would recommend!"
5.0,It looks perfect and makes a great gift for a baby gender reveal party.
5.0,Great bands..  Sturdy.. my favorite thing is that you get multiple sizes which REALLY came in handy since we don't know what size rings we wear!! :)
5.0,Me agrado mucho mi ni√±o esta feliz buen  material

5.0,I love everything about the red/black knit parent hat ( of the parent /child hat choice )  . The material is very soft. It is stylish. I have worn this hat in windy 40degree weather and my head stayed warm.  The hat is long enough to pull down over the ears and be comfortable.
5.0,"I love this! The material was lightweight, the cut was flattering and it was the perfect cover-up to wear over your bathing suit to the beach."
5.0,Quick ship and nice comfy fit bi expected they would be hot but they are very comfortable!!
5.0,I am really impressed with this yoga bra and pants set. I ordered a large and wish the pants came in an extra large. My waist is 28 inches and hips are 38 inches.  I can wear the large but they are just a tiny bit restrictive...but I bought them to wear while exercising and riding my bike so maybe in a month or so they will fit better! My bust is 34DD and the bra has a nice and snug fit yet not uncomfortable. I washed the set in cold water on gentle cycle and hung to dry. The rose color is neon pink and is awesome! The wicking on the pants and bra is great because it seems like it absorbs the sweat. Very happy I made this purchase. I received this item at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased review.
5.0,I love this wallet! I bought it for college cause I didn't want to keep having to dig my student I.D. out of my bag whenever I needed to get into a building or pay for something. And I also wanted to keep some cash and cards easily assessable to me. The color is great. I haven't had any problems in using it. The wallet itself is pretty light just have to be careful not to overload it with too much stuff.
5.0,"It was way to small even with ordering an xl, their was a hole in the left sleeve... very disappointed"
5.0,Shoes fit my 18 month grandbaby perfectly.  The colors are vibrant and they're simply beautiful.  I'll definitely order again.
5.0,Ordered for my mom
5.0,"When I bought this is was planning on giving it as a gift but I loved it so much I decided I wanted to keep it for myself. It came in quicker then what I expected. and it looks pretty much the same as it does in the picture. the only thing is the rose looks a little bit darker, more of a yellow color anyways its still really cute"
5.0,"Loved the product packaging. Comes in a sturdy thin case, which I am using to store my extra bands."
5.0,My husband and I are very pleased with these necklaces.  They fit great and are very lovely.  I received these necklaces at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I would recommend these to any couple who wants to show there affections with each other.
5.0,"These boots are super comfortable and fit like a glove! For the price, they can‚Äôt be beat! They look cute on weather they‚Äôre peaking out from under jeans or fully exposed with leggings. I‚Äôve received a bunch of compliments on them and will be back to buy more colors."
5.0,My daughter wears them so I assume she likes them

5.0,Love this shirt and I plan on buying another one when this one gets ruined.
5.0,I just wanted to say this is a really beautiful bracelet. I got this as a gift for a friend and she loved it too. I almost wanted to keep it for myself but it was a gift. I might just get one for myself.  I'm giving u a million stars‚≠ê!! BEAUTIFUL!!!&#34;
5.0,"Buy 2! Classic staple for your closet. Very stretchy, comfy, and flattering. I danced all night and it was lightweight enough to keep me cool."
5.0,I find the top of this suit to be super comfortable. It's not real supportive for the ladies but I think it fits nicely and has a good tank top/swimsuit top look to it. The bottoms are just ok but I have a little extra fluff that the seams dig in to. If I could tone up a bit it would probably fit well but I think I'd still prefer a little more booty coverage.
5.0,beautiful! looks and feel very expensive!
5.0,Very nice bracelet highly detailed

5.0,Very pretty tiger
5.0,"I'm a true L/12 and I bought the large.  It fits great and the material is of good quality.  You may have wear a camisole underneath as the white top is a bit see through.  Overall, I love it, wished it came in a better colour variety or I would buy more"

5.0,Nice socks. Unfortunately my husband has swelling in his feet and for him they were too tight. Donated them.
5.0,Bought for my 11 year old who wanted to dress up as an FBI agent for Halloween.  This is meant to fit an adult but it worked on him just fine.  He wants to go into Law Enforcement as an adult so he still wears this hat often and dreams about being one one day.

5.0,These socks are super cute! They are much softer and more durable than I expected. Very happy with them!

5.0,Stretchability great and pretty clasp with hook closure. I liked enough I ordered 2 colors.
5.0,"The fit is a little large, size down one size. I love the feel and length! Legs don‚Äôt get tangled up in fabric, nice and cozy. The weight is just right. NOT hot and heavy."
5.0,"this thing was way too tight with no stretch, I had to cut the white under slip out of it, I wish a picture of the dress inside out had been posted where it is being sold, i would not have purchased it HOWEVER&lt; i stopped the entire airport in this thing, even women were stopping me to give me compliments which was awesome, no way i would have been able to get in this dress ( i purchase THEE largest size) without having my fabric scizzors to cut that slip thing out, it was not too see through without the slip, it flows better without the slip and looks a lot less frumpy (which is a risk with this dress) without the slip. nothing but compliments in this dress, check it out on my you toob chanel number 5"
5.0,This dress fits exactly as I hoped it would. Snug without being unforgiving. It accentuates without showing every single flaw. The colors are so bright and the seams are solid. It is thin material so a slip is required. I wore it for 8 hours in court today and it was super comfortable and I received many compliments on it. It pairs well with some black heels and a red purse. I am really pleased with this dress!!!<br />ETA: For sizing purposes I am 5'1 110 lbs and a small fits perfect.
5.0,I love how it looks but it fit slightly too small
5.0,Did there job!
5.0,"Very cute top! The packaging was extra cute and environmentally friendly. The top is form fitting but has a very good stretch and is not sheer. It is also longer than an average shirt, which makes it great for working out."
5.0,I love these and they are more affordable than the other brands but still are very high quality and feel great.
5.0,Looks great !! The colors are beautiful
5.0,"Love, love, love it!"
5.0,It‚Äôs a bit small so if you have a large wrist may not be for you . This bracelet is heavy and sturdy enough for everyday. It‚Äôs not sterling it‚Äôs stainless steel. It blends well with my numerous sterling bracelets well.
5.0,Great color and fit.
5.0,Very adorable came as expected
5.0,Perfect went up one size bigger
5.0,This is the best belt I have ever owned.  I have had it 2 and 1/2  months and it still looks brand new. Very easy to shorten and no one will be able to see you shortened the belt. The punch tool required to shorten the belt is supplied. Very well made leather belt.
5.0,I bought it for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!!!
5.0,"Very cozy for sitting around and binging netflix, warm enough that I don‚Äôt need to waste money on heating the whole house"
5.0,I sent it back bc I ended up not needing it
5.0,"Came on time, fits great, easily adjustable and is very comfortable. Wish you guys did used electric guitars. I haven't had the best of luck so far but thanks for having a good product."
5.0,"definitely worth the $40&lt;, I love this sweater. it came is very secure packaging and smelled completely normal/no smell. it's true to size, I ordered up for it to be looser and honestly would have been fine getting a small. it looks so good, just like the picture, and has been SUPER durable! my dog usually scratches up all my sweaters as soon as they're on but he's nipped and scratched at this one so many times - no marks so far. no loose threads or splits or anything. the fabric is very soft and warm, not scratchy. and there are no holes/gaps in the sweater so you really don't need to wear anything under it :-) this is now my favorite sweater!!"
5.0,This was a gift for my niece who loves to eat Nutella.
5.0,I am very happy with this chain.

5.0,Daughter loves her necklace
5.0,"I really like thos sports bra. it's really soft & comfy. & unlike alot of sports bras I have purchased, it comes with padding that you have the option to keep in or take out. I have a rather large chest & I got an XL. It's a bit snug, but it's perfect for me."
5.0,A good watch. No handling (I have a lot of years). Its work in water.
5.0,"These are darling.  The detail of the continents hand-painted on these recycled glass marbles is marvelous.  I bought one each for exchange students I volunteered with the past school year, as a going away gift, and they loved them!  I need to buy one for myself!"
5.0,"OK, I have been looking for a bathing suit after losing 100 lbs. I wanted something that was comfortable and does not cut you under the arms. I wear a size 14-16. I usually order a large or XL, but bathing suits run small. I ordered the Xxl and it is perfect. Came earlier than I expected. Great price."
5.0,My teenage son loves them. They are eye-catching
5.0,"Great design! Especially appropriate for the ""darkly inclined"".<br />Love it!"
5.0,Just love it overall and wear it to a party
5.0,"Comfy, no problems with seller"
5.0,Was a little larger than expected.

5.0,nice thick material.  stretches well but not too much so they stay in place. definitely buying again.
5.0,"Awesome Hat,<br />I Truly Love My Hat & I Wear This Hat Almost Every Single Day ..  lol, Love It..."
5.0,"I ended up buying multiple pairs of these.  They are nice, lightweight, and look good.  I wouldn't mind if they had a bigger set since my head is huge, but they still work for me."
5.0,"My other granddaughter wore it for school, just loved it"
5.0,My boys are in love and they have worn all brands of compression pants. They are dying for more for football and basketball.  They said they are the most comfortable they have ever worn and the price is AMAZING! You have a repeat customer for sure!!!
5.0,Fit great. Not too thin. Not too thick.
5.0,This was a great gift to my friend who loves yugioh.
5.0,great reminder
5.0,"Really soft, comfortable fit. The neck has a firm hold, but the fabric has enough give that you don't feel like you're being choked! I generally prefer an XL in PattyBoutik to accommodate an ample upstairs without being too clingy. I should have sized down on this one, and will when I buy the navy."
5.0,I love this band and its so comfortable and easy to wear
5.0,"Great all-around use top for summertime.  I intend to wear layered, but by itself it is also very nice.  Fits as expected, sizes run true.  Material feels nice."
5.0,These are the best glasses I have bought in years. The are very well made and attractive. I will order another pair.<br />They are light weight enough to be comfortable and still very sturdy.
5.0,My LG V20 slid right into this very securely.  Not so bulky that it's annoying to keep in your pocket and not so thin that it slips from your hand.  Perfect balance of sleek and grip.  Definitely recommend!
5.0,Gorgeous cobalt blue pendant with a beautiful silver necklace!
5.0,great gift .. my grandson loved it .. conformation gift
5.0,"I have gotten many compliments about this purse, which I ordered as a birthday gift to myself. I love the color and it's super comfortable to carry. Lots of room for daily MOM stuff and it is soooo cute."
5.0,XXL FIT GREAT FOR SIZE 14 WOMEN<br />GREAT LENGTH!<br />WISH FOR MORE COLORS!
5.0,Good fit for my Mario-loving son.
5.0,"love this dress fits well about ankle, wash and dry well, comfortable material.  Not to thin.  Love this dress"
5.0,"I love these! Thin wicking material. Very stretchy! So much higher quality than expected. I‚Äôm a 34C, 28 inch waist, 36 inch hips, size S/4, 5‚Äô3, 130#, curvy-athletic. The small fits perfectly & the tag says US size small. If I weighed even 20 pounds more or was up to a D cup I‚Äôd still get a small bc they‚Äôre not really compression - they‚Äôre just skin tight and clingy. Move with you. Perfect for hot yoga without a bra. Very very similar to the 90 degree brand but run slightly smaller perhaps or similar. Probably more similar. These are an amazing bargain and I may even buy more since I do 2 yoga classes a day & the price is so good. Length is down to my hips. Doesn‚Äôt ride up. If you‚Äôre really tall like over 5‚Äô7 and love long tanks and weigh more than 150 and aren‚Äôt looking for compression then a M instead of a S may be better for you. But seriously these are soooo stretchy and not see through and not compression that I think they actually run big for their claim as a compression top."
5.0,My friend loves it. Beautiful
5.0,Great shirt. Need more album cover shirts
5.0,"Nice accessory, Means I can have my cat where ever I go!  Lots of complements too!"
5.0,Bought for a friend for church love it
5.0,I loved the first pair so much I ordered this two pack so I wouldn't be without a pair. They are super feather weight and have a great polarized view.
5.0,A comfortable medium sized purse with two open pockets and two zippered compartments on the one side and a good sized interior.  The adjustable strap is strong and the medium gray color is fashionable.  I love this brand.
5.0,I really like these for 4th of July!
5.0,"It's really a nice wallet! I didn't expect it to be this nice for the price. It smells like leather, and the compartments are perfect. It has a look and feel of quality that you would expect in a much higher priced wallet."
5.0,Used for wire wrapped necklace
5.0,The fit is good not clingy.
5.0,"Super Cute!! This is a super cute bathing suit! I really like it! The back of it is cut really low where the strings all are and it makes a cool weaved design. There are soft cups in the front which is a good thing, because the material is kind of thin so that should hopefully prevent any adverse visual wardrobe effects from cold water! I received this item at a reduced rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."
5.0,"I love this product.  Sometimes you just don't need a purse.  I use this when I  know that I only need cash, ID, credit card & phone.  I only wish it had a pocket for my eyeglass case."
5.0,"I like everything about these earrings... style, color and size! I really enjoy wearing them and going out with friends during the summer. In the sun, it becomes more dazzling. A good choice for summer."
5.0,"Very beautiful, thanks!üëç"
5.0,I love that these leggings are thick without being too thick. I hate when leggings become see through when you put them on and that was not the case with these! I found my new favorite leggings
5.0,"Great sock, very soft and comfortable"
5.0,So pretty! My husband loved it
5.0,The earrings were prettier than I expected and packed in a beautiful box. They were a Christmas present for my daughter and she loved them!
5.0,Super cute bathing suit that will flatter all body types.
5.0,I like my socks small. Love these I have bought them 3 times
5.0,Perfect.  So much so I got the saying tattooed on my other wrist.
5.0,"I almost bought a 3 PK from a different company that I was referred to. I went with these instead and have no regrets! I go to the gym 4-6 days a week and this has helped so much when I do cardio. Holds mask away from my face, and allows me to still wear lip balm without it rubbing off onto the mask. I can't wait to try these when I am out running errands to see if it helps prevent my makeup from smearing and my lipstick."
5.0,Nice fit love it ..
5.0,Very good replacement
5.0,It looks exactly like the real thing! I was so surprised and so happy
5.0,This ring is so unique and bright. Every time I wear it everyone thinks i spent so much money on it because of its beauty. It is so pretty and shiny I love it! Thank you so much!
5.0,This shirt is so cute. The floral print is really pretty. It's cute but sexy. It fits really well and it definitely makes my chest look good :)
5.0,"BICO Australia Star Pendant - Nice!<br /><br />* I love BICO products and I have been collecting them since the early 2000‚Äôs - I own many authentic BICO pendants and necklaces.<br />* This is an excellent addition to my personal BICO collection.<br /><br />** This pendant was sold by Tribal Hollywood Men's Jewelry. They have Excellent Customer Service... they seem to be a company that really cares about their customers and that also stands behind the products that they sell - a bonus!<br />* Product arrived in a nice looking shiny red bubble envelope and inside that was a nice gift box - a nice presentation and a great touch.<br /><br />** The only thing about the pendant itself is I would have liked that the black in the background was darker so that the Star on the pendant had more contrast, so that the Star had more depth and looked more 3-D like.<br /><br />*Overall - Excellent product.<br /><br />* Definitely Recommended product and seller."
5.0,"I must say I had my doubts about ordering this. All I could think of was that classic scene in National Lampoon‚Äôs Christmas Vacation when Cousin Eddie is wearing a visible dickie under his sheer v-neck sweater!!! But this half shirt solves a number of wardrobe problems for me. I love the look of a button-down under a sweater, but I‚Äôm busty - any top that will accommodate my chest comes with a lot of fabric that tends to bunch beneath a second layer. This eliminates all that extra material and I don‚Äôt have to worry about popping a button. And the intricate design of the collar makes this much more interesting that a standard white shirt. I was afraid it would shift around and ride up during the day, but it stays securely in place due to its length and the elastic bands that fit comfortably beneath your arms. Lastly, this top prevents me from getting too hot from wearing layers when the heat is cranked. Very smart purchase!"
5.0,Seems to be well made. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,"I wore this for the first time today and LOVED it!  It's the perfect fit--I'm 5'3'' 118 lbs and I rocked the small.  I like the length it's just below the knee, for you taller gals it will be just above. The fabric is interesting but does not detract from the style nor the wear."
5.0,Ive been looking for boxers that feel this good for years.
5.0,"honestly when i ordered these pajamas I didn‚Äôt expect greatness, but ended up beyond pleased with them! Nice material, nice shape, stylish design...my new favorites!"
5.0,Very pretty and I have received quite a few compliments.
5.0,Never heard of this company before and have gotten crappy cheap screen printed shirts before with poor results. But fits great. Print is really well done. Its much better than some NFL shirts Ive purchased. I have zero complaints. I would say that is not an athletic fit shirt. But I knew that going in from reading the review. I think they nailed it couldn't be happier with it. I dont have prime but I did get free shipping and it arrived a week earlier than expected. They shipped it the same day I put the order in. Was really impressed by this company. You nailed it.
5.0,EXCELENTE
5.0,Thick cute love the colors
5.0,"I totally Love it! The top part fits a little oddly, but then again I have a bigger cheat then waist. I wear a shirt under it. But I love the print and the feel"
5.0,Love these. They are a little shorted than a true crew length but they are tall enough to be ok. I really like the way the colors pop.
5.0,Its a great product. Loved it.
5.0,"Looks exactly like the photos, great clean finishes and very durable, well made. I'm so happy, it arrived quick."
5.0,Loved it. Great quality.
5.0,"When I opened the pretty box I was shocked!! I was NOT expecting such a big and beautiful piece of art work. I was stunned. I will defiantly order from this dealer again. Well done piece. So happy, can't wait to show it off at work."
5.0,Top fit extremely well which surprised me
5.0,"Great material and super cute! Slightly short, so maybe size up."
5.0,"Very pretty, very comfortable."
5.0,These are amazing! I threw out all my other underwear and will wear these only from now on. I was a little thrown back by the ‚Äúnude‚Äù underwear color. It was more of a pale yellow in my opinion. Overall these are great!
5.0,So this is a knockoff dress. But if you know that when you buy it you will be fine. The material is cheaper and the sizing runs a little on the big side but the cut and shape of the dress are really really great and I am so glad I bought this
5.0,"El vestido es lindo , pero corre peque√±o ordene una talla L y es como una S"
5.0,Great fit. Fun to wear
5.0,Cute outfit wore it in Mexico
5.0,Love the item just disposing rd in the delivery process
5.0,My niece a absolutely loved this suit!
5.0,No weird odors and actually have like a new leather type smell. They're super cute and well made. They are pretty narrow so I don't think they're made for super wide feet or calves.<br />Perfect for cosplay or costumes but my daughter will be pairing them with winter dresses. She is just 5 foot tall so they're to her knees but I think on myself(5ft7in) I think they would hit a couple inches under the knee. Very cute fall/winter boots!
5.0,Everyone wants one lots of I love its !!!
5.0,I was impressed it came with a Pandora charm box. My mother loved this charm.
5.0,Very good material like expensive pants.
5.0,Looks like a quality item.
5.0,Nice üëç
5.0,I bought this as a gift for Christmas. It's well made and looks exactly like the photo. Comes in a nice little box and is exactly as described. My Captain America fan thought it was pretty cool!
5.0,love this totally thinking of getting some as gifts. it came well wrapped. there has been no peeling or rusting or anything of the like even though its been worn all day every day since i got it.
5.0,I purchased this Women Lingerie Slips Satin Snip-It Half Slip Lace Underskirt Long White by Avidlove for my wife to wear to an event. She has a beautiful red dress. Floor length. Strapless. A flowing ruffle all the way from the top to the floor. The only downfall is that it's a bit see through. My wife has a corset like top but needed a half slip for the bottom. In our search to find her one we came upon this product. This review is based on her experiences using this product. Pros: Comfortable to wear. High quality. Made out of real satin with lace accents. It's a simple but beautiful garment. The material flows and does not stick to the skin. Price: This garment is better quality than what you would purchase at a place like Walmart and is considerably cheaper. Easy to wash. The directions say to hand wash and/or dry clean. But my wife washed it in cold water on the delicate cycle and it came out just fine. She hang dries it. Cons: Runs slightly small. It's a very subtle difference. Just be aware of this when ordering. My wife had to order this size because the one above it was longer and my wife is short (4 feet 11 inches). My wife said that this slip is great to have on hand. It can be worn to weddings. Formal events. Theater and music performances. Baptisms. Proms. Balls. It's better to have it ahead of time so it's there when you need it.

5.0,"This is such a cute hat! It looks just like the picture. The soft, fabric-covered headband feels nice against the head... but it also doesn't have any grip so it easily falls off the head. My teen wore it to a Halloween party and had to take it off just a few minutes in because she had to keep readjusting it all the time. The headband needs grips to keep it up."
5.0,"Very satisfied, fast shipping, good quality hat"

5.0,"The watch is great and keeps time really well. I haven't had an issue with it yet and I've had it for four months. Fits nice, looks great. Haven't taken the watch into water but seems like it'd be fine and would like have a panic attack if you wore it in the shower."
5.0,"Super adorable, thick material, looks exactly as pictured,"
5.0,Purchased as a possibility for wedding.  Very surprised and pleased with quality - far exceeded my expectations.  Fit much better than anything else I tried.  Received lots of compliments.  Didn't have to wear foundation garments since the weight of the fabric and pleating in the front gave enough coverage.  Hoping to have other opportunities to wear it.  Great value!
5.0,Wow
5.0,These are absolutely perfect for the gym. Don't expect to wear these out for hours they aren't too comfortable but if you use them just for the gym or to shower then they couldnt be any better! They dry almost completely by the time I have to pack them back in my gym bag. 10/10 would recommend.
5.0,Super cute & chic!

5.0,So far seems like a great quality shirt! One thing I didn‚Äôt not expect is that it is a graphic jersey. Material is jersey and so is the fit. So if a large is a normal cotton shirt better size up to a XL if you want a bit of a looser fit around your waist.
5.0,Gorgoues purse! The quality is great and even the little studs on the purse are Minnie's! The strap is a good length and the purse itself is lined nicely and could hold a small wallet your phone and some sunnies! Love it and have already gotten so many complients on it and the shipping was so fast!!
5.0,"I wore this with a retro style dress and got so many compliments on it. Wonderful bright shade of yellow, no shrinkage from washing either. Love it."
5.0,It was exactly how I thought it would be. It came earlier than they said it would and it was beautifully polished. Be sure of your size however as they are true to size.
5.0,"Good deal, nice shirts"

5.0,"At first I was very skeptical to pur hase these, but when I say these pants were just soo comfortable, I got home and could not take them off! The color is nice, its a great style to just throw on and go and the best part is that it is not too tight. The material is okay, not too bad. But these pants will definitely be my go to for now."
5.0,This shoe was perfect in size. Ordered size 8 and that is what I got.  It took quite awhile too reach me from China but true too their word the shoes did come. Thank you HAPPYLIVE!
5.0,Great purse lots of room in it
5.0,"Love it!!!! I am a size 8 in body dresses for Calvin Klein. 34D chest, 27 waist, 46 hip... Everyone love this dress, i didn't find any imperfection. The fabric is a little heavy (which is good if the wind blow, the dress doesn't up), but not hot. I wash in cold water, cool dry tumble, no shrinkage. Will buy another color!"
5.0,Very well made with a beautiful jewel color.
5.0,my kids loving it . me too

5.0,"Got these for a kid and they loved them, they picked them actually for the spiderman look and also cause they're waterproof! They've not been tested out yet but they've been put on in the house. Hope they will be waterproof! The instead is a soft furry material, not the cheap feeling furry stuff but a good quality soft material that will be warm!"
5.0,"I just love ByTheR clothes, and this is no exeption. I get compliments on all the items I wear by this company. The price is also great. Asymetrical, edgy clothes by other designers will usually run you at least twice as much."
5.0,Very nice and comfortable.
5.0,Fits just a little short. About 2 inches. I am 5'10&#34; 180 lbs. I knew I was taking a gamble though. I still think it is awesome!
5.0,My daughter loves it üòä
5.0,"Better than even the lesser Victoria Secret bras I usually purchase.<br />I would buy again, wish they had more colors!"
5.0,Great thick material and stylish! It does wrinkle but nothing more than other jackets.  Definitely worth it.
5.0,I bought these for Christmas for my almost 6 month old baby. I was worried they were going to be too big but they were are the perfect size. They are super cute!
5.0,"I love these unders! They are super soft, and comfy. I usually wear an XL in the underwear department, so I figured I would play it safe and go with that size for these, butt (underwear pun) I really could have just gone with a large."
5.0,"Great quality product and great looking, too.<br />Purchased for a 13 y/o. Put a big smile on that face!"

5.0,NICE RING FOR THE PRICE LOOKS GOOD.GOOD QUALITY S. SILVER.
5.0,"Perfect, beautiful"
5.0,"I bought a similar product like this for a friend of mine.  I love the quality and recycled nature of this product.  Though the picture doesn't really show much material detail, this little coin purse is made of a glossy plastic-like material.  It is the perfect size for holding credit cards, ID cards, cash, and change (for those times you just need to downsize to a smaller wallet).  I love this product and use it everyday."
5.0,Great to organize my duffel bag.
5.0,"Great dress for the cost! Looks and feels like a good quality dress. I'm 5'6 and it was 2"" above my knee. Just as expected üòä"
5.0,"fit well.  stretchy, got compliments. comfortable.  however the long back kept getting snagged on my shoes.  then I washed it and it got weird fuzzy.  I should have washed separately and hung to dry."
5.0,Gave as a gift to my sister. She was very happy with PJ's.
5.0,I like the item my only concern is if it is brown.
5.0,"I like it. I thought it will be a bit wider, but actually it is small. It is cute though."
5.0,I wore the first one so much it has faded and I needed a replacement.  This my favorite hat when driving with the top down!
5.0,Beautiful fit perfect
5.0,This bra is very comfortable! The padding and texture make it very comfortable to work out in. I even wear it out to the gym since the length cover most of my midsection.
5.0,"Light weight and is never too hot or too cold.It‚Äôs very lightweight and packable but at the same time amazingly warm.,Great for day hikes when it starts off cool and gets warmer so jacket comes off, it takes up no room in day pack."
5.0,"These are more comfortable than you might think, but due to the height of the heel, I highly recommend going up one size"
5.0,very comfy !
5.0,&#60;3

5.0,"They are absolutely adorable! It reaches up my leg mid thigh, but they are super warm and cute."
5.0,"We were a little hesitant in purchasing from a firm called Gem, but the quality of the item more than convinced us.  My wife enjoys the quality of this item much more than the previous one from a more expensive store. For us, Gem is a ""Gem."""
5.0,I bought these for my daughter who is 4 but on the bigger side on height and they fit her perfectly! They are thick enough to keep her covered well but not so thick that she's too hot with her school polo on top
5.0,It's cute and dainty so far no complaints
5.0,"Great body suit!  I am 5'7&#34;, 170lbs. (170cm, 77kg.)  I bought a size large.  It fits great, with a bit of room to spare. There is a built in shelf bra that fits me well (I am US size 34G), and the cross back lays nicely between my shoulder blades.  It does NOT go see-through when I bend over/squat.  I believe it would be appropriate for yoga/exercise.  There is a slight gap around the ankles (about 1 inch?) so if you have thick ankles it should fine. The fabric is soft and comfortable.  Best thing I've ever bought from Amazon."
5.0,The cap is quality made.
5.0,Awesome bracelet looks real and I get lots of compliments.
5.0,"Two preschool grandkids thought these were cool...  and that was BEFORE we turned out the lights.  Lots of giggles and squeals after that.  We took videos of them doing jumping jacks, giving &#34;light hugs&#34;, etc."
5.0,The wife is happy
5.0,I live in Hawaii and it's the perfect dress. Good quality and I would have bought more and I'm sorry that I didn't!
5.0,I love it!  After having 3 kids I am just a bit more conscious of my figure.  These gives pretty well and hides my belly which I really like.  It's cute for water park or lounging around the pool.
5.0,"I have used two caps out of the pack. Both are strong, smooth, and have not stretched. Most caps stretch at the band after a certain amount of time, these have not. I love these caps. The only reason I‚Äôm using two is when I misplace one, I still have the other. They work perfectly with my box braids."
5.0,Love this robe!
5.0,"I use this as a diaper bag for my 5 month old. I found that most of our outings are only a few hours at a time, and diaper bags on the market are huge! I can fit two outfits, a few bottles, changing pad/wipes/diapers, and a few toys. No more bulky diaper bag!"
5.0,Love this necklace set!! Ooodles of compliments and matches my best earth tone outfits
5.0,I needed jewelry boxes for some gifts. They arrived quickly and were sturdy.
5.0,My little grand daughter loved this princess wand. She has been using it everyday with her princess costumes. I think she even takes it to bed. It is very easy to assemble. It is very well made and a very nice quality. The rhinestones are attached very well.
5.0,"Loved them, bought for vacation and they held up nicely. They just seem not to fit to snug on smaller heads fyi"
5.0,Love it and wear it all the time!
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù & this dress hits mid knee for me. Accommodates my large bust & plenty of extra room to move about. I always order several sizes larger than my actual size bc I hate clothing in the summer & cant stand for it to touch me (AL humidity is a biotch).<br />The dress is a matte not shiny or chiffon (or bathing suit material like many dresses) & has no give making it airy & fun to wear!<br />Wear it as a dress or unbuttoned like a cardigan for cool summer evenings (if you‚Äôre lucky enough to live in a place that has them).<br />This will be excellent year round where I live with a bit of layering!<br />Going to buy the blue next. Hope they get more colors in bc this is a true win for me! Dress it up or down you won‚Äôt bs disappointed.<br />Runs exactly as stated in description üíØ<br />Keep up the fantastic work!
5.0,Durable and really compress my calves and shins. I wear these chasing chickens and I feel like they give me that extra edge.  Thanks HOFAM.
5.0,Great strap. Bought it for my daughter.  Easy to adjust and she loves it.
5.0,I bought this for my guy and he rocked it! Fit well. I ordered a XXL.
5.0,Soft and great fitting PJs for my 2 year old.
5.0,"best of all, it's vegan and it's made very well. I am very happy with it!!"
5.0,This is one of the best/cutest finds this summer. Just the perfect little conversation piece to complete a summer attire. A particular blogger that I follow makes the most awesome recommendations.
5.0,"I love this bracelet! my order was delivered very promptly & the packaging was terrific, so nothing got broken or mishandled! I was worried that when I received them one would be damaged or broken & I'd have to return it, but everything was perfect! & the bracelets themselves are awesome! You can wear just one, all together or mix & match! Whatever way, they look great! A definite MUST have, especially for the price!! Very satisfied costumer & I look forward to buying more jewelry!"
5.0,Amazing.
5.0,As described and wear it often for my fidget from anxiety issues.

5.0,Love this three piece sparkler!!  Exactly what I was looking for and quality is fantastic for the price.  Delivered fast too!  Highly recommend!
5.0,Nothing like the color in picture.
5.0,"Love, love, love this bag!!! I brag about it at the gym all the time, I've been searching for a great gym bag that will easily hold everything I want to haul. It keeps everything organized so I don't waste time digging, quick and easy to pack and unpack, holds everyone which is a lot since I go to gym early morning before work and shower there, so easy to carry, over the shoulder bags are clunky and fall off the shoulder, this is a backpack which allows me to carry something else if needed very easily and I can walk a normal pace while carrying it"
5.0,Best wallet ever!!! Is all as described.
5.0,"I love this!!! It's nice heavy material (a bit heavier than I expected but it's really nice!), long enough to be worn by itself, thick enough to hide flaws and stretchy enough to adjust as needed. Love it!"
5.0,"I wear 8-10 and ordered a large because I am tall and wanted it longer. I'm 5'8&#34; 155#.  It fits generously but the shorts are very short.  Main problem is that the elastic in the waist band is not tacked down anywhere and it twists horribly.  If you sew, tack it down at the side and center front seams BEFORE wearing.  Also, the drawstring is attached inside at center back, so when it disappears inside the casing, there is no getting it back.  You can't pull it out to reinsert it.  I just cut it off and the waist still fits fine.  The fabric is very soft and comfy.<br />Update: the company kindly contacted me saying that they are working on improving the issue with the elastic. I would buy these again."
5.0,"I've been wearing these for years. Great value for the money. Can't imagine why Sears would stop selling them. Dumb move on their part. Designer hoodies, who needs them?"
5.0,Inseam length was perfect.  There was more than enough room in the thighs that I didn‚Äôt have any problems while running.
5.0,I love that these have sleeves. They are actually great for my 2 year old when she‚Äôs eating spaghetti üòÜ
5.0,"I bought the yellow.  It was see through despite another review saying it wasn't.  I didn't like the shade of yellow on me, so I'm returning.  Other than that, the dress itself was well made and fit perfectly.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 130 lbs and i night a medium.  The dress fell to my knees."
5.0,Vibrant colors !
5.0,Fill your closet if you like hoodies!!
5.0,Highly recommend these for casual wear.
5.0,"I love this hat!  Comfortable, warm, stylish.  Very Happy!"

5.0,"being a retired marine engineer I was required to wear protective eye in many forms. these are excellent for the home workshop, lawnmowing, leaf blowing and other dusty places. They are easily cleaned with soap and water and will last for many uses."
5.0,"If you have looked the TLBC website before and know how their sizing is you'll love this bra because its the first wire-free bra that is comfortable and gives a lift! this bra will fit true to your size, it'll start off being a little tight but it will naturally stretch out over time"
5.0,"This is our third set!  They are so nice to have your clothes organized at your destination, with few wrinkles...easy to transfer your clothes from your luggage.  We were given two sets and just received this third set!  That is how much we like them!"

5.0,"I have another of the same item, with different magnification factor; different colors makes it easy for me to see which is which.<br />The temples have sliders with detentes for sizing the head loop. My head is medium-sized, and these get just about big enough for me. Those with large heads may not like them."
5.0,Great hat. Looks great and fits great. Get a lot of compliments. Great quality with a Stetson Hat.
5.0,"Look ridiculous, but they're nice for the price. Gave them to my buddy as a gag, he loves them."
5.0,Just as described great price.

5.0,Grandson is a good basket ball player so a basketball shirt was perfect for his birthday.

5.0,"These boxer briefs are going to be the greatest around for the fourth. If this will not show my love for this country I do not what will. It will also go good with all of the other stuff that I have for that day. I just love the fit of them. They fit so well and plus they have a breathable cotton for comfort and the elastic waistband fits very great around you. I just love the pattern that the Boxer brief has; which is US Flag Design,and some Great Stars! These flag boxer briefs have that flexible waistband that is comfortable and able to keep its shape. Just love how it snugglies on my body but not too tight. The boxer brief has material like 95% Cotton, 5% Elastane.Belt Material:100% Nylon.You would want to wash it in cold water machine wash is acceptable to keep the color longer..<br /><br />This is what the seller had to say:<br />The underwear is mostly designed into sexy, fashion and unique one for our customers.<br />Machine wash in cold or warm water, hot water will destroy material softy.<br />100% Customer satisfaction Guarantee, feel free to leave Customer Questions & answers or email to us.<br />Please note the size details we offered, is not standard us size, but the size we offer is enough for main sizes of men.<br />if you worry about the size measurement issue, or size fitting issue, we suggest you to buy the bigger size if yours between both sizes.<br />any pack of 4/5/6 include each piece of differnt color we have.<br />Other accessories not included,only underwears/briefs/boxers.<br /><br />I got this at a discount to give my honest review."

5.0,Is perfect size medium
5.0,"First I ordered a 6 based on the reviews, but that was too big. So ordering the size based on the chart I came out to a size 4. I am 5'2 and 116 lbs. It fits very well, good quality. What I will say and you will see others stating, the elastic on the sleeves is way to tight. I had to have altered and add inch and half of elastic. This is a real dress, not a costume piece. I am going to look authentically dressed the part at Oktoberfest! My husband says the bratwurst is already cooking..."
5.0,I love the way the dress feels and fit it‚Äôs super comfortable .Perfect if you just want to be cute and comfy.
5.0,I like everything about this brand. I bought one and loved it so much I ordered another. Great color selection and good price.

5.0,"These cloths are great.  I gave my sister a piece of silver jewelry for Christmas and included one of these cloths with it.  They last a very long time (just don't wash it), and do a great job of removing tarnish.  I use them to clean my jewelry (and silverware) on a regular basis and have always been satisfied with results."
5.0,Love this bracelet! Cute and well made. Great if you have small wrists.
5.0,Was to large gave to my granddaughter
5.0,"The picture doesn't do this ring justice.  It's a beautiful royal blue and really shines!  I got a size 10 and it fits perfectly.  I initially ordered the black carbon fiber and didn't like it.  Shawn at Metal Masters was very helpful and exchanged it for me with no questions asked within 5 business days.  I'd recommend these guys and their products to anyone, and I certainly will be.  Order with confidence, and you won't regret it!  I have a beautiful wedding band!"
5.0,I didn't realize these would be as small as they are because i forgot to read. but they are very cool and will be fun to use.
5.0,Necklace fob
5.0,Super fast shipping and makes me laugh. Definitely lots of fur and recommend wearing leggings or something since inside of pants feels weird but was totally worth it üòÅ
5.0,"Love, love, love this! Perfect weight for layering arms soooo soft. I want one in every color! I'm 5'3&#34; and it hits perfectly above the knee and doesn't shallow me. So many other long cardigans look like bathrobes when you're short, but not this one!"
5.0,It works very well! I love it. Wear it all the time. Battery lasts a full day too!
5.0,These globes feel like magic on your hands. They really have the ability of helping you scroll through touch screen devices.
5.0,"This backpack is so gorgeous.  My boyfriend uses it and it looks sleek and fits all of his books and laptop quite nicely.  It is great quality as well, with zippers that run smoothly and straps that are well-designed and put together to hang mid-back.  The only thing I will say is that it is a little on the small side, so if you need something to carry a lot back and forth, this might not be the best option for you.  But if you're looking for something that looks great and will last you a very long time and carry a moderate amount of things, this is an excellent option and I would highly recommend it."
5.0,This is a Christmas present and I can‚Äôt wait for my friend to see it!!  I love C4 belts.
5.0,"I purchased this purse for my wife for mothers day, she absolutely loves it! She has no complaints what so ever around the purse at this point!"
5.0,Exactly what we were looking for!
5.0,I absolutely love these earrings!!!
5.0,I wear this watch all day except when charging. This elastic band let‚Äôs my skin breathe. It‚Äôs more comfortable than the silicone band that comes with it. Looks nice too.
5.0,"So comfy! My second pair. The foam padding wears down fast, but still has cushion. I like them like that. Great around the house scuffs!"
5.0,"After reading some reviews, I decided to buy whole size bigger than I normally wear and it was a good decision. They run pretty small and I was worried they would be too big when they came but they fit perfectly with thin-normal socks. Go up a size and a half if you prefer wearing thick socks.<br />They arrived pretty quickly in the mail. They are also really cute and are good quality."
5.0,"Nice good looking piece, bought the black also"
5.0,"It is what it says it is, soft plush robe. It fits great, is very comfortable and was just what I was looking for."
5.0,Looks wonderful. Wife loves it. She was surprised at the weight of it.
5.0,These fit amazing! I am going to purchase more of them!
5.0,Cute shirt!<br />Size ran a little bit small.
5.0,"Semi sheer, it's like a linen blend material. I want this as a beach cover up but it could possibly be worn with jeans or as a casual outfit. The fit was great, it's flowy and fresh. Doesn't feel too hot. It was probably below my thigh and wasn't tight around the shoulders or anything, this fabric has zero stretch."
5.0,Look belt.  Quality  is good
5.0,This is a nice cotton-poly t-shirt with a soft finish that feels good against the skin. I especially like the scoop-neck for summertime -- it's not too low and feels great.<br /><br />The shirt washes and dries just fine; I've worn it many times and it shows no wear yet. I would buy another.
5.0,Great dress. Fits great.
5.0,"My dauhter LOVES Five Nights at Freddy's! She was ecstatic to get this pajama outfit as an early Valentines day gift. Fits as expected, super adorable and super comfy and I'm more than positive she will never change out of them. Will eventually have to scrape them off of her lol"
5.0,Perfect.  I have received many compliments! I purchased a brand to match and wear this as an alternative to my wedding set. I love it!
5.0,"Attractive scarf with handy pocket for cell phone, etc."

5.0,"Believes will withstand ""normal"" baggage handling and is easily identifiable on luggage."
5.0,It was for a gift and looked as advertised
5.0,"This dress is soft and comfortable. @ 5'1"" a small hits at/slightly above the mid-thigh. @ 140lbs typically wear a medium but this small is loose and flowy, so size down. Arm length is perfect and so is turtle neck size."
5.0,These socks are warm without causing sweat. We love them!
5.0,great and amazing!
5.0,"This is an awesome band, it‚Äôs very comfortable and it allows you to adjust the size.  The material is so soft and the price is good too!  I‚Äôm going to get few different designs to match my outfits."

5.0,"Well I am just a man guessing, I guess this time I chose wisely. Very elegant and will make her smile."
5.0,"I love these socks! I‚Äôm an 8 1/2 and they‚Äôre the perfect length up to the ankle. If you‚Äôve ever worn Hurachi‚Äôs, you know it‚Äôs quite difficult to get in and out of that sneaker. Most ankle socks are either too thick that it makes it very difficult to get in the shoe or so thin and small that they might slide off throughout the day. These socks are that perfect in-between. I‚Äôm they are very secure on my foot and haven‚Äôt slid down once but also aren‚Äôt so thick as to make it a pain to get in and out of my sneakers."
5.0,nice quality and good fit
5.0,"We just came from Rome and Florence( Firenze) and fell in love with il Doumo.  My wife was missing this charm of our trip. I got her this charm form her birthday and when I received it, I was impress. It looked like the real thing up to the red terracotta tile roof. Very nice craftmanship and material. Not cheap looking at all. My wife loves it!!!!"
5.0,Love the scarf it's beautiful
5.0,Cumpli√≥ con lo esperado
5.0,"I love it so far!!!! It does not make my phone feel mych heavier, but it seems like it will protect it in case of a drop. I haven't dropped it with this case on my phone yet but if I do, I'll try to come back and comment on the case's protection. I love the glitter :)"
5.0,good quality. nice and soft. fit as expected. got a size medium and it fit well.
5.0,Nice larger size and reasonable price
5.0,"My granddaughter love everything about it, and it got home way before X-Mas, Thanks"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:1d31d567e89969edc5ad9b712632af2a]] I love these leggings, exactly what I was looking for - perfect fit, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 125 lb wearing a Medium. A little long but they will be great for hiking"
5.0,"Muy buena calidad, los mejores materiales como deber√≠a ser un producto  original."
5.0,"This seems like a great bag, not too big but holds my everyday stuff.  Seems very well made.  I added  a water bottle holder to one side and small flashlight  holder to the back. I have it set up so I can attach it to my backpack with 4 tier system strap-buckles by Garud."
5.0,These shoes have lasted my 11 year old son longer than any other shoe to include Sketchers and Reeboks. Good qaulity for the money!
5.0,"These are adorable. They came quickly too, which is always a plus."
5.0,This is an amazing piece of jewelry! Been watching this one for a while and finally gave in and purchased! I just love it!!

5.0,"I bought this product to one of my best friend. I bought it as a gift, he is really happy about it and he is recommending this product. He is very pleased about it."
5.0,Absolutely in love with this dress. I am 5'9&#34; and nothing is ever long enough for me. This dress touches the floor! The material is shiny as opposed to cotton but is otherwise exactly as represented. Pockets are a huge plus.
5.0,Quick delivery and very cute!
5.0,This is a great wrap.  I work from home but sometimes get cold in my office.  I love that I can throw this on and stay a little warmer.  It is very stylish and the material and weight are perfect.
5.0,"I fell in love with these purses several years ago. I only have 1 because of the price and when I saw this one on sale for over half off, I had to have it. It's bigger than I thought and is now my favorite purse, it is absolutely beautiful!!!!"
5.0,Wow. They are perfect üëå.  I will forever imply that they were insanely expensive if anyone asks. Definitely the classy glam look every girl needs.
5.0,These boots are so comfortable and light! They  look great and fit perfectly. The price is amazing.
5.0,Excellent machine and waited impatiently for shipping in a very extravaganza
5.0,I get complements on this shirt all the time.  The item is as described.
5.0,Cute summer dress. Stretches a lot.
5.0,I wore this as a voodoo queen in a dance showcase and a pirate at Halloween.  Lightweight and fit well.  Received quite a few compliments.
5.0,I showed via photo it to my mum and she loves the colors. Looking forward to give it to her when i see her.
5.0,"Great Item, make's Apple watch look nice designer watch."
5.0,"Dot&Dot Large Flat Hanging Toiletry Bag<br /><br />I attend my daughter's volleyball practices and games. I keep a bag full of things and I threw together a first aide kit. I needed a bag to hold all the things I put in the kit. I found this travel bag and wanted to give it a try.<br />¬†<br />Pros:¬†¬†¬†<br /> ‚Ä¢ 2 separate compartments<br /> ‚Ä¢ Zippers open easy<br /> ‚Ä¢ Zippers have rubber ends<br /> ‚Ä¢ Handle on top<br /> ‚Ä¢ Elastic straps inside for holding<br /> ‚Ä¢ 2 mesh storage areas<br /><br />¬†¬†<br />Cons: ¬†None<br />This bag is perfect for my first aide supplies. It has three separate zippered areas and plenty of room for what I need to carry. The zippers are sewn on well and the thumb piece has a rubber end for easy grabbing. The top of it has small handle for carrying. Inside, there are elastic straps to hold items in place. On the other compartment there are two mesh screened pouches. Overall, I am very pleased with this travel bag."
5.0,Loved the ring and how it fit!
5.0,Great price&delivery.<br />Sooo comfy w/side pockets. I use it as housedress. Throw shawl over it to get mail in lobby & still look cool :)
5.0,"I love this dress. It‚Äôs an interesting fabric, thick but silky on the outside. It is too low to wear a bra with the fabric is thick enough to conceal."
5.0,"Beautiful pair of earrings! Looks like a diamond, and I love the screw on back so I can make it tighter on my child."
5.0,"The stone is clear and bright and the white sapphires are larger than anticipated for the price. It is not deep enough in color to be classified a swiss blue, but the topaz has a good strong blue color. The bail is large enough to change out to a different chain, though the accompanying chain quite substantial for a small pendant.Good value for the price. Would make a nice gift if you're holiday shopping."
5.0,These boots fit great and are comfortable right out of the box. I‚Äôve been wearing them through the Minnesota winter and they‚Äôve held up well. Water proof and warm - only noticed some cold toes when it was -4 degrees Fahrenheit.
5.0,"When I originally opened my package and saw these things, I was underwhelmed. First of all, they came in one color, highlighter green (way more neon than the picture even), and they felt flimsy. But I thought ""meh, they're cheap and will work for now""...<br /><br />I had these flip flops for 2 full years, until last week when one finally broke after tripping on something. I cried, these stupid neon green flip flops became iconic to me. I even got neon green rainboots and running shoes just to be consistent when I couldn't wear them lol so yeah. That's my opinion on these things"
5.0,Definitely would be recommending this to my coworkers It‚Äôs hard to find good shoelaces that last through rough conditions
5.0,"I love the skirt!  I am wearing it to church and it is the perfect fit and church appropriate.  The material is thin so please wear a black slip, spanx or body shaper underneath...CANNOT wear panties because the lining will definitely show.  The length is good and the bowtie is super cute and enhances the skirt.  I wear a size 12 so I ordered an XXL because I read other reviews but I really could have gotten an XL.  I will have to get it taken in, in the waist area but it's worth doing so I am not complaining nor do I have any complaints on the skirt.  I will be purchasing other colors to wear for Spring!!!  Cute skirt and great price! GET IT!!!!! Just order your true size."
5.0,"I am impressed with the extra communication from this seller! They sent me 2 follow-up emails, one if which contained cleaning instructions for the jewelry! I like the do-it-yourself for jewelry cleaning, and the ph of my skin can do a number on jewelry! The item us beautiful, and the addition of the cards, etc, was great too!! Thx Quan Jewelry!"
5.0,Watch works fine. Alarm is soft. Waychband fits my small arm
5.0,Beautiful and good quality. I love all the different colors. Would purchase again!
5.0,"This is a great little mask, very lightweight with an Exhale port and I love the filters that can be inserted easily and changed out. The only downfall for me is I have a small, thin face and they are a little bit large for me but the ear straps are adjustable. You can also order replacement filters!"
5.0,"This is a top quality jersey- good looking durable fabric in a substantial weight. I bought two in the home and away versions of my varsity jerseys of long ago to relive my glory days on the gridiron (LOL!), so I won‚Äôt be wearing them over any pads, and while you could easily do so, it still fits me in my regular size over a T shirt. I have no doubt it would hold up well in competition, unlike those low quality cheapo ‚Äúfan jerseys‚Äù. The numbering/lettering is a first class job, and clearly applied properly so as to be permanent. Good choice of colors in the jersey and fonts to choose from to get the look of your old uniform or that of a favorite team. Be advised that their navy blue is a very dark shade which comes close to black. In my contact with the seller over a minor inquiry, they were friendly, polite, and quick to respond. All in all, I am entirely satisfied and happy to recommend HK highly."
5.0,Very nice shirt at a great price! My favorite brand of shirt.
5.0,"Great value as an add-on item. Wife uses it as a beach top. Well ventilated, wicks moisture efficiently."
5.0,I like the fit. Feels fresh. I purchased the Large size.
5.0,Not much to say...the hat is pretty much amazing.  Looks identical to the picture. Fits like any other trucker hat.
5.0,"The picture doesn't do justice. It is 100% even better looking in person. The color of ""London Blue Topaz"" is SO gorgeous.<br /><br />I gave a bracelet/necklace/earrings as a GIFT for my friend's birthday - B072KFCRV4 (pendant), B081PRGRG1 (bracelet), and B076KXV6JD (Earrings). She absolutely loved it.<br /><br />What an amazing combination. You have nothing to lose getting it and checking it in person with FREE Returns. It's better than anything you can find in any local jewelry store!"
5.0,"Super cute! I have a tiny neck so they're a little loose, but it's not bad at all. They're very trendy :)"
5.0,"Awesome fit, awesome material, I am going to order the black one too!"
5.0,my daughter loves it!!!
5.0,Loved this piece... it was the perfect compliment for my wedding dress and hijab....
5.0,These fit my 4.5 year old son just right with plenty of room to grow for him. They're plastic but have enough bend in the sides that if the kids bend them out to put them on like my son always does (even though I always tell him not to because thats how he's broken so many pairs before) that they didn't break. That's always a bonus. He loves them and wore them even when we went back inside so he's a big fan. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.
5.0,"This fits as expected.  True large size.  The fact that it is 100% cotton means that it is breathable.  Perfect undershirt for cold weather.  To top it off, I was lucky enough to receive this shirt at a discounted price I e change for my honest opinion.....love it!!!!"
5.0,"Got this in 18mm for the new Timex ""Blackout"" Marlin hand-wind reissue. This one even has a double fold-over security clasp."
5.0,"Absolutely love this hat. It is well made,  attractive, and warm!"
5.0,Really like this band. Only beef is the holes are a bit oddly spaced for my wrist.
5.0,Quality product with an understated classic design.  The leather is does not readily show abrasion.
5.0,Adorable coin purses. I use them all for something in my purse. They are pretty good quality.
5.0,Really happy with the jacket. Light breathable and really pretty yellow color.
5.0,"Gave as a gift to my daughter, she loves them!"
5.0,"I had gotten my normal size, a 7. They fit perfect; and I wore chunky thermal socks too. These were purchased to wear for a weekend trip to St Paul Minnesota. Temperature daily ranged from 18 degrees to 36 degrees. There was snow. There were huge puddles from snow melting. My feet stood dry and normal warm. No overheating feet. And last I walked- A LOT‚Ä¶ there were zero comfort issues; zero issues with hold up of boots. Truly loved them and for the price you cannot get any better. Absolutely recommend these!"
5.0,"After buying the matching necklace that my wife loved, I got the matching earrings too. They came on time and in a nice small black cloth bag. They do appear as seen in the picture. The earrings are larger than I expected which is GREAT. They are very beautiful, uncut, pieces of amethyst. My wife loves the necklace, and I'm sure she will love these too."
5.0,Really soft.Does not hurt your feet.Loved them.
5.0,"Love this - it's great quality and I'm going to wear mine to the BTS concert in April in Santa Clara!  I cannot wait.  It's a really nice fit, good sewing on the seams, and printing on it is really cool. I got a XL and I usually wear a Gap 8/10, fits me perfectly."
5.0,"Arrived quickly and are perfect. Dont forget to make sure you are ordering right piece. You either get leggings or vest, not both. Leggings are perfect fit for my girlfriend. awesome gift and bright colors."
5.0,Great sneakers!
5.0,Beautiful ring for our 89 year old dad! He loves it!
5.0,"Putting these overalls on I feel like I need to get something done. Paint a bedroom, move some furniture, they're inspiring. Would recommend."
5.0,A big hit as a stocking-stuffer for a cat lover.<br />They are comfortable as well as cute.
5.0,Love the feel and keeps me cool.
5.0,Beautifully handcrafted.
5.0,"Roomy, lightweight, washable."
5.0,These combrwean panties fit amazing. It comes above my belly button. They are very soft and comfortable. It is high waisted and doesn‚Äôt roll down. The colors are nice and bright. They are soft smooth and washes very well.  I will be purchasing more in the future.
5.0,"Great gift, recipient loved it. Nice length and width too"
5.0,I love my charm!
5.0,Light weight reading glasses (1.50). I've worn them while working on my computer for an entire day with no eyestrain or headache like I've gotten from similarly priced reading glasses.
5.0,"Nice roomy purse for the price, great value!"
5.0,I love this hat. It‚Äôs lightweight with excellent face coverage. It also looks good. I have a large head so finding an adequate  sun hat is difficult. I lost my first one so I bought a second one. Worth the $.
5.0,I don't usually buy dresses on Amazon but this one is perfect - fits well and the material is great - does not require ironing. Good quality stuff.
5.0,I bought these for my very outdoorsy fiance and he loves them. The polarized lenses relieve eyestrain and allow him to fully enjoy the colors of nature while letting him look for fish and obstacles in the river.
5.0,This worked perfectly for my son's lumberjack-themed first birthday party! He looked so adorable. I highly recommend this product!
5.0,"These are SUPER soft and comfortable - great leisure pants! Don't seem to attract too much pet hair. Would not recommend if you have pets that might claw these as they look like they might get pulls easily. Comfortable fit, true to size, nice leg length and very comfy waist band. I don't find these any warmer than normal trackie daks."
5.0,You don't have to be a punk rocker do enjoy this leather bracelet. Wasn't sure about the style at first but when I received it.. it's so well put together that it's not cheap looking at all. The whole thing is based on two leather braided straps there about 5 millimeters each put together with looks like stainless steel adornments. The clasp and Hardware in the front are all highly polished was no defects. If you don't like it the manufacturer does have a warranty..so it can be returned. I did order the 7.5 which runs a little small but most of these bracelets online are usually too big. I have repaired the bigger ones by using heat gun pulling off one of the ends trimming the leather and  epoxying the end back on so it's a perfect fit. This one I might try the opposite where I can pull the end clasp and fill with epoxy and make the size slightly bigger. Please don't do this if you don't know what you're doing..but it is an easy fix if you have the right equipment. The magnetic clasp makes it easy to put on and take off and seems to hold well when being used. Overall I think that this bracelet is worth giving it a try. I did receive this product at a discount for a fair and honest review. I hope this will make your decision in buying this product. Thanks for reading.
5.0,When I open the box I was amazed at the color and quality.  How well they match the earring.  I think alone or with the matching earring it is beautiful.
5.0,"It is the PERFECT ring for Halloween!!  Looks great, it's big and blingy.  I absolutely HATE spiders, but I love this ring.  May wear it the whole month of October.  I won't really, but it's cute enough that I want to ;D"
5.0,I am IN LOVE. I just took my pin out of the envelope and it is utterly gorgeous!! The photo matches it perfectly and I was very pleased to see the back had two clasps rather than one! I'll be checking out more of TheMysteryShack's merchandise soon!
5.0,Buy inexpensive earrings only because I lose them all the time sometimes hurt my ears. Thought I would give these a try were not that expensive and really like hoops. Great buy the clasp is very sturdy. Each package contained a pair nothing missing. Thinking about buying another set just in case I lose one.
5.0,"Sweater was as described, colors were accurate. Happy with purchase"
5.0,Super cool! This is made for smaller wrists. Bracelets are usually super big on my small wrist but this is snug. Beware of you have bigger wrists it will be tight!!
5.0,"I wasn't expecting non much from this product, I was wrong,  they have a very good quality and the durability is pretty good, just be aware on the size you choose."
5.0,Works great as a cover up. You can go from swim to lunch and feel comfortable

5.0,The dress fit my granddaughter perfectly ! The colors are bright and happy and she loves the dress!<br />It is well made and I will purchase more clothing from this company !
5.0,I really like these shirts. I was prepared to hate these shirts because most shirts you buy online is hit and miss. These are high quality material. The neck is strong and the print is built to last. High quality material. I bought 3 of these shirts from this Amazon seller and I'm extremely happy with them. Thank you.
5.0,Every thing CP creates is wonderful!
5.0,"Nice hat, all as expected. Would like to find a little lighter weight more breathable version for really hot days. Not sure why manufacturers only make the really big brimmed synthetic styles for this end."

5.0,"I generally dont wear coats or jackets. The are big, bulky, and in the way. Well, so is the flu! I was looking for something that will keep me warm and well but not feel restricted when I came upon this jacket. It is exactly what I've been looking for and comes in 3 colors so it will match anything. Another thing that I like about it is that it can go with a pair of jeans or a can go with a nicer alpha so I don't have to worry about changing a jacket depending on what I'm wearing. Works for me!"

I panicked and thought I forgot to bring them with me!  Love the color too."
5.0,These are great for those not soo cold or hot nights. I loved the feel and fit.
5.0,"It‚Äôs just right in every way.  The length, the weight (very light) and it‚Äôs beautiful.  Thank you so much,Spunky, I couldn‚Äôt be happier!"

5.0,Great fit and easy install!
5.0,"This dress is awesome I absolutely loved it. recieved a bunch of compliments . Just wear a spank without not regular underwear, the dress seems to move the underwear so you will find yourself pulling your underwear out your butt all day."
5.0,Very cute and work perfect in taking pictures with my 1 year old and my 3 year old...
5.0,High quality. Met my expectations.
5.0,"Love the colors, the material is super thick and perfect for the fall/winter weather in Colorado."
5.0,"Love it, love it, love it. I cannot say it enough times...how much I love this bracelet...and so does everyone else, because every time I wear it I get compliments gallore on it :-)"
5.0,Like it very much too
5.0,Love these glasses. They fit well over my prescription glasses.  I gave a pair to my daughter to wear when she jogs and she says the glasses don't bounce around like the ones she had. And they are pretty.
5.0,I wasn't sure if I'd be happy with this because some of the stuff I've ordered from overseas before was made poorly.  This is actually made really well and it's super cut.
5.0,"Just as I expected! Great looks!  Great Quality!  I may be out of shape for the squared circle, but the mask lives up to its end of the bargain...."
5.0,Love love love them. They fit exact.
5.0,received a lot of compliments on this scarf ring
5.0,This is an awesome necklace and looks much more expensive than in the picture. Love it.
5.0,"Nice quality, nice bright colors & receive many compliments when wearing them!"
5.0,this skirt is way beyond what I expected - it looks very classic and upscale.
5.0,I just had a baby so I don't know my specific measurements right now but I think I'm a large. I sized up to an XL and it fits perfectly.<br />The jumpsuit is super cute and I can't wait to wear
5.0,Great glasses.... I'm happy customer !
5.0,If you are between sizes go with the larger
5.0,"Great duffel bag...only used it on one trip, but unless it breaks down in a hurry I doubt I'll lower my rating.  It's sturdy, simple and does the job - like a Carhartt product should.  Solid size side pocket, small inner pocket in main storage area, heavy duty zippers, solid handles and should strap.  My concern is the water proof bottom will break down, but unless I'm really hard on it, it should last.  Holds tons of stuff."
5.0,Oh My! This dress is amazing. And the quality is of high standard. Will order from this seller again.
5.0,I bought this in white for me and black for my daughter.  Lots of room for all your everyday things and lots of compartments.  You could use this as a briefcase/purse. Love it üòç
5.0,I am in love! It fits perfectly and is so flattering too. I need one in every color!!!!
5.0,The keychain wasn‚Äôt cheaply made at all. I love it. I get compliments on it everyday I love it.
5.0,"Just what I needed to make a short necklace wearable. These are a nice quality, looks like the finish will last after prolonged wearing."
5.0,I ordered 2 sizes up since it looked like it ran small but I would say just one size up and it would be a good flowing looking with lots of movement. I keep mine because I wear it with leggings and like my told loose with that. Really great quality its a thick material not some cheap thin top. Would definitely buy in more designs if available.
5.0,"Absolutely in love with this earrings :D<br />The size is perfect, I honestly bought them for myself because I like to wear small earrings but gave them to my mother, i recommend this product, you're gonna love it ;D"
5.0,"Fit me  perfect , very nice  Beautiful ."
5.0,I bought this to give to my bf in the beginning of our relationship and he keeps it in his backpack that he takes everywhere with him. I keep mine on my vanity when I'm not wearing it. I like that it gives my wrist a little added weight and that the bracelet fits my wrist and his! I have very small wrists and he has a bigger wrist. I love couple matching and this is perfect! He notices every time I wear it and smiles. I sometimes wear it on my ankle whenever I'm wearing shorts or capris. Definitely a great gift!
5.0,Pairs well with the lv toiletry 26. Love it!
5.0,Fits great! Very cute! Goes to down about to knees.
5.0,"My kid loves to wear this. Amazing fit and love the material. After the first wash, no shrinkage or fading of color noted."
5.0,This ensemble came quickly and is just as described. I can't wait to wear it. I sized up because I wanted to be comfortable and did not want any costume malfunctions. I was super glad that I did.
5.0,Since we have both Packer and Bear fas in our house these are the perfect gifts for both Teens.
5.0,Enjoy
5.0,Fit is Perfect! So soft and comfortable would wear every day if possible!
5.0,"This dress is beautiful! I'm more on the curvy side, but it hugged in all the right places to be flattering. The fabric is thick, but not too much for a spring day in Florida. The places where the embroidery touch the skin can be somewhat rough, but not enough to take away from the overall 5 stars this dress deserves."
5.0,How it came so soon and the price is what I like about it!.
5.0,"Just Gorgeous and Classy‚ÄºÔ∏è Not to mention the packaging - A nicely folded brown envelope with pink ribbon üéÄ‚ô•Ô∏è, The Quality of the scarf is just Amazing üòâ, Thank You üòä"
5.0,"Perfect.  Bought 5 pairs of these.  5'10&#34;, around 175 lbs.  Bought the large with ample room in the waist.  Plenty long and LOVE the belt loops.  Material is great."
5.0,Extremely happy with my purchase! Watch is Gorgous!!!! Very fast shipping!

5.0,Loved the dress. Got lots of compliments on it!
5.0,Perfect gift for maid of honor
5.0,"I adore this shirt. The pockets are a great addition for someone who loved to keep their hands out of the way. The white is a little see through, but not sheer - just be aware when making your purchase. This is one of the best, most comfortable and flattering shirts I have found in quite a while! The top of the shirt is a bit wider than I was expecting, so when I am not wearing over a long sleeved tank (when winter goes away) - I will need to pay attention to which bra is worn with it, as not to show straps. The length of the top is nice and the bottom of the tank is elastic, so it does not flop or curl in the wrong direction like so many other tops!"
5.0,"This product its great, comfortable, it don't itch and it does its job amazing. I will really recommend this product and will buy it again"
5.0,Great boots and we love the look with the bows
5.0,Perfect gift for a yoga teacher!
5.0,"Fits my Pokemon Go-tcha. I have a Pokemon lanyard so I wanted something I could clip on that, and this does the job. I've even gone bike riding and raiding in Pokemon with it and the Go-tcha stays secured.<br /><br />I ordered 2 and gave the second one to my spouse, since his wrist is too big for the watchband the Go-tcha comes with. He is enjoying his as well"
5.0,These leggings are the best! Very good quality for the price! They look good and feel good! So comfy to workout in! Definitely buy some!!!!
5.0,"Love those joggers, very comfortable and looks really nice!"
5.0,My daughter is a size 6 and we ordered a medium. It fit her perfectly. It‚Äôs been washed a few times and we‚Äôve had no issues with fraying or anything ripping. She ordered two (red and black). The skirt fits her about 2 inches above her knee and she is 5‚Äô7.
5.0,"These one inch sterling silver earrings are great.  Light weight on ears, just the right size.  Really like the faceted appearance which sparkle. Also like the snap closure which is secure.  Highly recommend."
5.0,The glasses are helping me drive at night.  Love them.
5.0,Got it for my wife and she couldn't get enough of it. She loved it very much. Fitting was perfect for her size too.

5.0,Very happy with the headbands! Item arrived just as shown in the pictures. Like having two bandanna's that I can wash and rotate between. Would buy again for sure! Thanks!
5.0,The shirt is comfortable and moisture wicking‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not the most fashionable shirt but to work out with it‚Äôs just fine!
5.0,"Perfect, cool and comfortable to workout in!  Had many nice compliments on shirt!<br />Excellent and very on time shipping!"
5.0,I guess know im a gold fan. It‚Äôs beautiful. I‚Äôve gotten lots of compliments on this
5.0,I wanted a strap that would stay put but wouldn't cut off circulation to my wrist. This one fits the bill. It's comfortable and pretty decent looking. I have gave the rest of my watch straps a rest and this has been my go to.
5.0,purchased for a bride and ironed on last name. worked out perfect
5.0,Fun earrings! Great textures and presence. The attention to detail is fantastic and they definitely do not look like every other pair of silver earrings. Have gotten compliments every time I've worn them.
5.0,"Great bag, durable & strong stitches"
5.0,Great product.  Came quickly and item matches description perfectly. My patients love it.
5.0,I love wolves and this was a nice addition to the collection I have honoring that
5.0,"The estimated fit dimensions are pretty accurate! the bottoms are a little tight of my waist, but that‚Äôs no fault of the bathing suit itself! The material is very soft and the top has a great balance of sturdy, with coverage, and a hint of cleavage. All in all, a great bathing suit that I very well may purchase again in another color."
5.0,Recieved it today ... it was small but good quality
5.0,Well made and the perfect yellow.  Just what I wanted to add pop to some of my outfits.
5.0,I always get compliments in this it's super cute
5.0,"Great, used on a forward helix! Fits very nice!!"
5.0,This swimsuit is adorable and perfect for a vacation! The top fit as expected even though I‚Äôm about a 32A. The bottoms are cute but very cheeky which is why I didn‚Äôt show them on here so only buy this bikini if you‚Äôre comfortable with showing some skin!
5.0,very nice quality.  they seem quite sturdy and the beads are so pretty!
5.0,I wore this for a semi-formal lunch (got it for a space themed grad party though). The price I paid was under $7 with Prime when this had a coupon for a percentage off on it so I wasn't expecting much... This is comparable to my $50 dresses though. Even better because it's not dry clean only - so I'm still very ecstatic. VERY WELL MADE FOR THE PRICE. Worth far more than I put out for it.
5.0,They are very beautiful sandals
5.0,Gift for the wife
5.0,Great product fast shipping
5.0,I have received my bracelet(EARLY!) i will definitely be buying more products from them. This bracelet is just adorable looks exactly like it does in the picture with a claw and chain for more size options.
5.0,I first got my boyfriend some peppers as a birthday present and I loved his so much that I finally bought my own pair and they are awesome! I had friends keep taking them from me at the beach because they are polarized and you can see right through the water with these. They are super cute and fit great!
5.0,"I wear a 6.5, I ordered the 5.5-6.5 and they fit perfectly! Love the color, it‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for!"
5.0,"my wife is 5'4&#34; and 180 she adores this hoodie,ordered a size us20 and its a little floppy but fits great ,the cut will not allow any thick sweater under it as the the sleeve under the arm is tapered making for little room in the armpit but what a great price  and super witchy just like her,i would definitely buy it again great for leggins and boots or any other boho fashionista ,,"
5.0,"Product is great. Lightweight and easy to wear. Easy to breath in.  Three different light settings ‚Äî- on, slow strobe, fast strobe."
5.0,Really beautiful and just as pictured!  I love it!  :)
5.0,I bought this to wear over my bathing suit for my trip to Cancun this year 2017 for my birthday. Let me tell and the vibrant colors are simply amazing against the amazing blue ocean. I fit as one against the beautiful background. I was like the  mermaid goddess of the sea. I think I rocked it.... I'm not a model by the way...lolü§£ü§£üòò
5.0,"This cloth cleans better than other jewelry cloths that I have had.  I am also happy with its size.  Very, very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Nice to have color option changes. Very comfortable rubberized band.
5.0,"I gave this as a gift but may buy another for myself. The quality is much nicer than the price would suggest. If found in a retail store, it might very well be tagged with the &#34;list price&#34; stated here."
5.0,Luv it!  Goes great with my man cave horror collection! Highley recommend
5.0,Awesome bad.. Have gotten lots of compliments....
5.0,Perfect for school teachers. True to size
5.0,"It's a cute dress, especially for the price. It's super flowy so be careful if you're in a breezy area! I wore it to a wedding and got lots of compliments on it!"

5.0,Very soft and light have washed these twice since I got them last month very well made and not pricey will be buying from this company again.
5.0,"My girl loves this shirt to wear under her adidas hoodies, keeps her warm enough that she doesn‚Äôt need a jacket. Good price also, I would buy again"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:2ca503c31b541b88f4675041dba0078b]] I absolutely am in love with my necklace. It came out perfectly. Better than expected and shipping didn't take too long either. It actually came a lot earlier than expected. I also want you to know that Jesus loves you so much and He died for youüíïüíï
5.0,Great item for the price and the cost. Love it and highly recommend. It arrives quickly too!
5.0,Love how dainty they look!!!
5.0,Nice thick material used so they don‚Äôt easily bend out of shape. Nice size for wearing
5.0,GREAT BAN
5.0,I really like the outfit and it fits just right
5.0,"Good quality, great design, a bit wide, but I think it might be so it fits most babies. However with the strap it doesn't feel loose."
5.0,"I ordered a 2x, and I'm a size 16.  It was a perfect fit for me, not tight anywhere and just skimmed my body.  I got so many compliments on this dress.  I wore it to a gala where women were wearing very expensive couture gowns and I did not feel out of place.  I was worried about the zipper from other reviews so I just pulled it on over my head.  It's a stretch lace and a stretch lining so it was easy to do.  I hope I can find other places to wear this dress because it was so comfortable and flattering.  I can't believe how cheap it was, because it certainly didn't look like it.  I had to show my friend my order history because she swore I was lying about the cost.  I'm a pear shape and it looked great, but I think this silhouette will work on any number of figures."
5.0,Good quality shirt purchased for my son‚Äôs Hawaii themed day at school
5.0,The fit was excellent. Also the garment washed well with little or no shrinkage.  Good product
5.0,my grandson loved them

5.0,"I love these, they are so adorable."
5.0,Perfect fit!!  I highly recommend this brand of leggings as a less expensive alternative to LuLaRoe
5.0,Purchased for my niece. She loves it!
5.0,"Purchased two of these saws. Both arrived broken. In  my opinion, there is a design flaw in the assembly. The motor/blade pivot so you can cut any angle up to 45 degrees. The motor mount is cast aluminum and it has one projection on each side which enters a curved nylon bushing on the saws outer case. The saw is supposed to pivot within this nylon bushing, On the first saw, the aluminum projection had been dislodged from the bushing, which had been badly damaged and the motor was suspended by motor wiring and what ever the motor could rest on. In spite of trying for several hours of trying to get the mount back into the bushing, it was of no avail. Then I realized the saw probably wouldn't work well due to the damaged bushing preventing precise adjustments.<br />So... I sent that one back and ordered another one. Same thing. Nylon bushing damged again and motor mount out of place. I am in process of sending that one back.<br />Bosch is generally a very good product, but this cheap arrangement is in need of rethinking. Next, I'm going somewhere where I can examine the product prior to purchasing it."
5.0,"I bought this not knowing if I would love it.  It is pretty but not overly sparkly.  It has held up well, even when getting wet washing hands.  I would buy again!"
5.0,Very simple... yet Beautiful !
5.0,"As of yet, I don't know anything about how they fit or if my sons even like them but I know they will for I myself wear Vionic shoes, that's the main reason I ordered these."
5.0,"Sturdy, snug, light for no leather. Very happy with purchase."
5.0,I think I'm gonna buy another one. :)

5.0,Love it.very modern and unique..will be getting more
5.0,"These cute little birds were a gift to my mom. She loves the pin. The art work is very sturdy. Will buy gifts like that again. The pin came in a gift box, which was very nice."
5.0,"One of our Scouts bridged to Ambassador, so we wanted to get her a simple pearl necklace.  This is elegant looking.  She's worn it all summer through sand and sun and sweat ad it still looks beautiful.  We'll be ordering more when our next group of girls bridge."
5.0,working good
5.0,"Se ve de buen material, peso ligero al doblarse."

5.0,Gave it to my daughter - it looks wonderful on her! The charms were just right for her!
5.0,I love these for my daughter--no messing with laces or velcro or tongues that get out of whack.  They are easy for her to get on and off herself.  The quality is great--she will outgrow them before they wear out.  Easy to throw in the washer and dryer when they get dirty.  Highly recommended!
5.0,"It‚Äôs long which I like, coming well below the knees. It was a little stiff at first bu, as cotton does,  has softened with each washing. I bought two and am pleased!"
5.0,"Perfect, thanks"
5.0,It‚Äôs very thin but I expect that! Supper cute and comfy tho.
5.0,I purchased these for two of my best friends. They loved it!!
5.0,I got them for my brothers birthday and he loved them!

5.0,This is bomb I'm about to order every color lol
5.0,"SO CUTE! The color is lighter than the picture, but still very cute. The headband is really comfortable and doesn't push into your head, which I love. I ended up curing off the veil bc I couldn't get it to come down, but other than that, it was perfect."
5.0,Very cool scarf.  Bought as a gift and she loved it.
5.0,Omg this necklace is everything and more it looks exactly like the picture just flawless will order again
5.0,Looks stunning.
5.0,"My new favorite socks! These are super comfortable and they're the perfect thickness. Great in my boots, but also perfect to wear around the house. I've got chilly hardwood floors and these keep my feet warm all day. Cannot beat these for the price and I'll definitely be buying more!"
5.0,Order arrived quickly and product was great.
5.0,"Looks just like real pants. Wear anywhere. Drawstring, no fly."
5.0,"I purchased this suit on a whim and I'm very pleased. After having a baby, I wanted something high waisted, but still cute and flattering. I love where all the ruffles hit on me. I feel more confident in this suit than I did before having a baby, and that says a lot! If you follow the sizing chart it will fit well. I usually wear a M or L, but ordered XL and it fits well."
5.0,"vibrant and lightweight, just like the picture"
5.0,"Absolutely adorable, love the fabric. My granddaughter is very slender so it's just slightly loose."
5.0,Excellent fit... color is the right shade I was looking for.
5.0,well made and fits my 7-1/2 fat head lol
5.0,"For the price I was not sure what to expect, but I am so happy with this band.  The leather is petty descent quality, and the hardware is sturdy.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to upgrade their Fitbit band."
5.0,It was super. Slipped over my shoe and made me all kinds more confident in wearing shoes that I usually never wear.
5.0,I actually love these overalls. They are made with heavy fabric and made well. I think I will love them more after many washes. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 3‚Äù and 112 pounds. I ordered the small and they fit nicely. Not to tight nor too baggy. I didn‚Äôt need to hem them either.
5.0,Amazing fit!
5.0,TGEY ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
5.0,"Cute, versatile bag for when you want a smaller purse.  Even though small, you can fit in the essentials."
5.0,I am pregnant & growing out of my panties.... These r so comfy & super cute...would totally buy againüëçüëç
5.0,Use it for the beach or the shower it does what it is meant to do.
5.0,"This sweater is nice!  Well worth the value.  Have received many compliments, even from my husband.  Will buy more.  The fit is as expected but I think that I will go a size up for a longer length."
5.0,Big but we added a belt 'cause they look great!!!
5.0,Beautiful vintage dress for the price. I get compliments all the time and it hugs your curves in all the right places!

5.0,So cute and is exactly like the picture.
5.0,"This is my go to jacket. Love wearing it, plenty of pockets for storing items. Only draw back is I wish it had a thicker liner. I recommend layering up if you are going to be in cold conditions for longer than an hour."
5.0,"Great contrast, excellent fit and appearance."
5.0,"This cosplay is good enough for what it is. The uniform is accurate to the photo. Since I‚Äôve been cosplaying for a long time I‚Äôm very used to ordering 2 sizes up, but following the size chart I was a small so I ordered it skeptically. Even though I ordered a small it‚Äôs still a bit baggy, with the pants being a bit too big. It‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt fix, but I‚Äôd say follow the size chart exactly"
5.0,It's very warm and comfortable.
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 120lbs. Small fit great, very warm. Loving it!"
5.0,"Loved this dress wore it on my trip to Morocco very comfortable and appropriate. Love, love, love it."
5.0,"It's very pretty, the chain is very thin,  it makes a very nice gift."
5.0,My kid loves them. Great buy for price.
5.0,Thinner than you expect but pretty good.  I have had them for a couple of months and they are holding up really well.  I only gave a 4 starbecause socks are expected to last longer than 3 months so I cannot attest to longterm durability.  Great in summer as they are thin and cool and very comfortable.  Not sure how they will do for warmth in winter.  I would get these again.
5.0,Perfect lightweight shrug for a church function.
5.0,This is a beautiful bracelet!!! It is very dainty and feminine. It's much prettier than the photos. It‚Äôs well made. I will be buying this again for my family and friends!

5.0,The material holds on to the wrinkles. Love the cut.

5.0,"My son is 3 and without fail everything we found at stores were to big and didn‚Äôt fit right and he was able to break/bend them up.<br />These are light weight, flexible, and fit him properly"
5.0,They fit great and are WAY less expensive than the competitors. Look at the prices for Speedo And TYR on this type of short. Ridiculous! Thank you EASEA for giving me a sensible alternative for the shorts I wear under my wetsuit!
5.0,real leather. excellent as was showed
5.0,Love this dress! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and it was a little long so I hemmed it for cheap at the dry cleaner. Worth every penny.

5.0,great coverup
5.0,Fits as expected if you read the reviews and pay attention to the size chart. Ordered up a size looks beautiful on super cute can't wait to wear it in the summer.
5.0,This bracelet is a pleasure to wear.  It‚Äôs good looking.  It‚Äôs masculine.  It‚Äôs comfortable.  It looks good with other bracelets.
5.0,I had to return the first one because I bought size large and it was huge even though he wears a large shirtThank goodness for the free quick return policy. I had liked the lightweight and quality so I got the small and it has washed well and fits
5.0,"Great statement piece.  The clasp is a little difficult to handle but other than that, you can't beat it."
5.0,"Just got this in the mail. It looks just as it does in the picture. It feels very high quality, solid and heavy. The clip function doesn‚Äôt feel cheap or flimsy. I‚Äôm honestly surprised it‚Äôs not more expensive. Based on what I‚Äôve received, I‚Äôm definitely going to buy more products from this brand."
5.0,Really like these.
5.0,"Nice shade of blue, nice addition to a collection of Camaro hats"

5.0,"Great fit, includes 2 filters, getting many compliments"
5.0,The silk kimono is as advertised.  It is beautiful.  Thanks for a great product.
5.0,"I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù, 130 lbs. I ordered the XL & am glad I did. The sleeves and length I had to do some petite fashion hacks to, but it fits just right in the width. It is super soft on the inside & I'm really happy with the quality of the decal. It‚Äôs really heavy and warm too. The only other thing is it has no ‚Äúgive ‚Äú to it at all. You can‚Äôt pull on it to give yourself extra room. I expect it to hold up really well by washing inside out and letting it air dry."
5.0,Vert comfortable against the skin and breathable.  Did not roll like other activewear.  Ran a 5k in comfort.
5.0,This dress is so super cute and flirty! Definitely a date night dress. I got a 2xl but is a little large--just a little around the side bust area but I think I can use a pin to pull fabric a little closer to my skin. I'm a 38DDD. I do recommend this dress. You can either make it halter or spaghetti straps over both shoulders.
5.0,Super cute. Good quality!
5.0,"These fit perfectly, are so comfortable, lounging around or at the gym, and are so flattering on my butt. My new favorite leggings!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:34f32bea8ede4f97d766d34f84236871]] Excellent quality, my 7 year old daughter loves those gloves"
5.0,"Quality earrings.  They look great dressed up for the evening or even with a casual top & jeans.  Slightly larger than I anticipated as they hit right about the jaw line, but the designers got it right.  Great addition to the wardrobe."
5.0,Super cute and  light weight. Got tons of compliments on them from bougie people who I was soo excited to let them know that they were non name band and cost me $10 on amazon... love the matte finish.
5.0,Perfect solution to avoiding the cost of prescription sunglasses. Great price and looks good on my prescription glasses. You have to get used to the clasp onto your glasses but after wearing a few times I was good. Nice that they flip up so you can go from plain to sunglasses without removing them.
5.0,I bought this cap for a gift and it fit well. This cap is for a small framed size head so pick them wisely or I would measure to be sure!
5.0,I love this watch band! I wash my hands a lot and get sweaty often and the silicone bands cause me to break out from all the extra moisture and I was having a hard time finding a watch band that was cute and wouldn't cause me to break out. I was scared this band would feel like a dog collar material but it does not and I never break out anymore. It has made me so happy. I was about to give up wearing my watch. Also you can't beat the price.
5.0,This purchase was a birthday gift for someone who loves flamingos and travels.  Large enough to easily spot on a baggage carousel.
5.0,Cute hoodie! My son loved it!!
5.0,I'm super skinny but it fits me so well! Also so in love with the color!
5.0,Hubby loves it.

5.0,"Good fit, nice fleece fabric, sturdy build, pockets."
5.0,What a classy little dress! I got SO many complements on this fit and style! Super comfortable as well!
5.0,Very nice belt for the price.
5.0,I like the fit of this zip hoodie. It keeps me warm on chilly days and is good as a jacket on mild weather days. The quality of this hoodie is great. Washed it a few times and the color is not fading nor is the stitching deteriorating.
5.0,"My daughter absolutely LOVES this! Great chain, beautiful design, top notch! Highly recommend!"
5.0,Dainty and cute!!  Lots of compliments on this necklace. Not really long enough to double layer though like the photo suggests.
5.0,Fits as expected. Very cute and comfortable. The material is very soft!
5.0,Could use a better chain but overall great product
5.0,This product was another good buy. My son loves it.

5.0,great colors
5.0,Perfect love them
5.0,"Charlotte is five and loves the umbrella. Stabs her brother with it. Beats the dog with it. Prays for rain so she can leave the house with it. One of her favorite Christmas gifts, hands down."
5.0,I love this hat so mucbh

5.0,It fits perfectly! Its beautiful and unique! Amazing!
5.0,It fit a little smaller than expected. It‚Äôs great quality!
5.0,"My grandson LOVED these shoes. Comfy, warm and especially the indoor-outdoor soles. Washed just fine and tumble dried on low heat."
5.0,Smoking hot suit!! It fits true to size. The medium is perfect for me. Will be ordering in another color. It's perfect!!
5.0,"Reviewed by spouse:<br /><br />This is a very chic blouse/top. The overall fit was good.¬†¬†I‚Äôm wearing a large and for sizing reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 154 and 34d And it fits perfectly. I wish The v-neck in the front was a little deeper it‚Äôs more of a modest cut, but nice nonetheless. The back is completely sheer so you could wear a cami¬†¬†under it or I have on a nude colored bra and I thought that looked fine. The front is lined so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it being see-through in the front."
5.0,I love this bracelet!! I wear it all the time!
5.0,"They fit so nice and are super high quality with a gorgeous bag and case.<br />The lenses are beyond what I thought they‚Äôd be. They bring the world into clear focus and even though they are dark glasses, they brighten up the view."
5.0,"I love this dress. It's so nice looking, and the material is kind of a stretchy/elastic matetial. IT works perfectly for Belle cosplay."
5.0,"This suit is fantastic. I never thought I would ever say that about seersucker, a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g. I receive compliments about it everyday (Thursday's only) I wear it. Great fit, great weight, great comfort. My ugly problem is that I blew out the crotch after wearing it twice. Lil' restitching and it was as good as new."
5.0,"I have to order these face masks again.  They‚Äôre comfortable and pretty.  I get compliments on them all the time.  I have no problem wearing a face mask, especially during this season where there is so much pollen.  If wearing a face mask helps others, I‚Äôm happy to so so for the greater good of our people."
5.0,Really good quality! I love it! =D
5.0,Updating my review. I received it. I like it very much.
5.0,Have you ever wondered what being a true Patriot felt like? Buy this hat<br />Do you find yourself staying awake at night on July 3rd thinking of what to wear the next day? Buy this hat<br />Have you been the guy known to wear boring old baseball caps and want to change that? Buy this hat<br />Do you want people to start checking out more than just your killer physique? Buy this hat<br />Are you a proud American that wants to embody all that is great in this nation? Buy this hat<br /><br />Also the material is good
5.0,I love this sexy and classy romper! It looks exactly like the picture and it's so flowy. If you are wider at the hips you might need to order a size up. I'm a size 10 dresses and 8 jeans and I ordered the large.
5.0,LOve this
5.0,There are so many and all great quality. I can change mine out everyday!
5.0,Cute and comfortable dress - plus it has pockets! :)
5.0,The picture does not do justice for the watch.  Absolutely lovely for the price.
5.0,Love this tank. I'm 6'2 And wear a 22 and the 2xl is long enough even for me.. usually have a hard time finding tanks that are long enough and go to hips.
5.0,Cute band.Fits my pebble 2 watch. Design is on on 1 side of the band and sides.not sure how long the color/designs will hold up. Only time will tell
5.0,I just got this and I love it! I felt like it hugged my curves perfectly! I got a large I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 164 pounds.  It does stretch a bit so it‚Äôs see through but just make sure to wear a slit under it.
5.0,Great material. Fit as expected. Fast shipping. Thank you
5.0,"I wear watch caps all the time, summer and winter. I recently bought a blaze orange tactical knit hat made by Underarmor, supposedly a great company. The cap cost more than twice as much as this one. Two weeks after I bought the Underarmor cap, the stitching let go between the inner and outer shell. Hat is basically unwearable now.<br /><br />This Wolverine watch cap is perfect. It's rugged enough for extreme use and it fits nicely, There's plenty of elasticity and material to keep you warm and the cap in place. I have no problem recommending these caps.<br /><br />Note#: I received this cap at a discount in exchange for an honest review. Regardless as to how it came into my position, I think it's a fine watch cap. although, I probably could have done without the leather tag/logo."
5.0,"I am so happy with all the mid length little dresses I have purchased this season, this purple one is sassy with the ruffle hem, and cap sleeve. It even has pockets ...."
5.0,"Quality product made by quality individuals!! I wear mine once a week to our FC, added a pic to LinkedIn and amazonions from all over are asking how to order it!!  Would make a great Christmas gift !"
5.0,This dress has beautiful princess seams which drape lovingly to my curves.
5.0,"Nice shirt, that slim fit"
5.0,"Great shirt, fit my hubby perfectly."
5.0,Exactly what my daughter wanted and fits great!
5.0,"I have ordered multiple of the same sunglasses for my bf, so he could have in every vehicle.  He seem to like them very much"
5.0,Get compliments on this watch every time I wear it. I love it.
5.0,Love the fit of these bike shorts! Great tight fit no tugging and pulling! Stay put.<br />The phone pocket fits a IPhone 12 max pro and similar.
5.0,It's comfortable and good stretch but sheer
5.0,"I really liked this product. it is snug on the arm, but not too tight that I cannot move. It helps alleviate my pain, which is super exciting. Also, I am a plus-size gal, so I was worried the arm sleeve would roll down but it did not.  I wish I would have gotten more colors.<br />The fabric is breathable and cool as well. I have it when I go walking and my arm does not feel hot. I purchased a size Large."
5.0,This purchase was for my teenage son and he loves it.
5.0,Very comfortable and flattering.  I always get compliments when I wear this shirt.
5.0,Super stylish shades... look very Parisian- sort of a Paris in April 2017 vibe.
5.0,Great shirt. Fast delivery
5.0,This is a cozy sweater with a snug fit (form-fitting).  I like it mostly because it is different than your typical sweater design.  I would highly recommend it especially for the price.
5.0,Paints a little worse for wear in the edges doesn't have the clean painted finish as in photo.Kinda gives a cheap effect. I'm thinking of gettin acrylic paint and touching it up maybe wig aglossy sealant too. But friend loved it . Apples are her thing so it's nice. Fits in Palm of her hand . Nice antiqufinished looking chain
5.0,"Despite how it looks in the pictures these clear packing cubes are really clear and lets you take a sneak peek at the contents without the need of unzipping and looking inside.  I'm, very happy about the purchase.  This is our second set that we purchased within four months.  Just glad that the product was still available after four months since we purchased our first set."
5.0,"We all turned heads when sexy badass Australian cutie, Emily Browning, graced the movie screens and television promos with her kittenish, doleful eyes and her sultry, pouty lips. The fact that she can just as easily dual wield a pistol and a katana and carve up a 50-foot robot-knight makes the Babydoll character she plays in ""Sucker Punch"" all the more enticing. And when you put the actress and the fantasy together in one sickly slick photo presentation, you'd be hard pressed to put something more instantly beautiful and awesome on your wall.<br /><br />The action of the first main hallucination sequence from the movie -- the snowy Japanese temple -- is barely glimpsed behind her, but the real show is of course the sexy cut-off school girl top with her otherwise exposed belly button cleverly hidden by an overlong neck ribbon (like something out of anime). Honestly, there's something almost piratey about the outfit's design, but that only makes it cooler. Emily sports a near expressionless cold stare (she's looks about to pounce with her weapons drawn), but there's a hint of sadness in her eyes. It's a very fitting representation of the character, and the whole thing is finished up nicely with the slick silver ""Sucker Punch"" logo sweeping the lower half of the picture, just barely leaving an opening for the sight of the slit in her skirt. There's nothing slutty or sexist about this picture because the scene just oozes girl power charm. A very classy tribute to a lovely up and coming actress and her neo Alice-in-Wonderland persona.<br /><br />I enclosed it in a simple black plastic frame: $9.99 from TARGET (don't ripped off by the stuff on Amazon)--- oh my gawd :O Soooooooo HAWT! The dark tertiary colors and steely modern look matches my room interior as well as a really cool poster I have of ""The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess"""
5.0,My husband was needing a new wallet so I say this one and gave it a shot. I thought it looked good cause it had so many card slots and 2 bill pockets like I know my husband likes. When he first seen it he looked at me ‚Äúreally‚Äù. He hated how big it was (wide) compared to his current one. He decided to give it a shot and after a few days he told me He Loves His new Walket. He said with the same stuff in it as before it lays flatter in his butt and he don‚Äôt have to take his wallet out of his pocket to sit down. His other wallet would make him sit lopsided and throw his back out. Sometimes the smallest diffances make the world of diifferance!
5.0,"I really liked these bras! I tried several including underwire and fold over style. These worked great for me and I ended up buying another pack. They‚Äôre supportive enough for daily activity and I wear them to work just fine.<br /><br />As another buyer stated, the pads shift (a lot) so I just took them out and wear washable inserts instead."
5.0,"Fit perfectly out of the bag, the quality is perfect. I‚Äôm so happy with this dress!"
5.0,Love these glasses and the fast service
5.0,"Nice fabric, great fit.  A little longer than I expected, but overall a great top"
5.0,It is beautiful!!
5.0,It‚Äôs a great piece to add to my collection<br />The Rosegold is beautiful !

5.0,Just how i wanted it
5.0,I have no complaints about this purchase. It was easy to attach to the watch and it‚Äôs a comfortable every day wear
5.0,Love it but is a gift for daughter in law for Christmas
5.0,I love my skirt.
5.0,"My 13 year old granddaughter whose birthday is in March wanted a blue stone ring. (Aquamarines are thousands of dollars)!. I bought this ring for her and it was beautiful! I almost kept it for myself as I have a March Birthday as well. It‚Äôs been 5 months and she still loves it, takes good care of it, and has shown me she is mature enough to begin receiving some of my authentic Aqua jewelry soon!"
5.0,I purchased this collection of fingerless gloves as a gift--the recipient was very happy--nice color selection--well made--good price--fast shipping
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my mother in law and she loved it. Very pretty purple color, super soft feel and fit perfectly."
5.0,~These gloves are good Quality and fit nice~Good shipment~Thank You!!
5.0,Nice uplift without pushing up and out of the cips.
5.0,We needed a book character costume as my son wanted to be Pete the Cat and the Perfect Pizza Party.  This is apron and chef's hat were perfect for him!  It has a nice weight to it and fits him well.
5.0,Very beautiful and clearly is great quality! It‚Äôs solid and has a beautiful sparkle to it! It came with a nice satchel for protection and even included an additional chain! Very satisfied!
5.0,These are the best underwear....stains don't have a chance to set or ruin these underwear!
5.0,"Excellent product, easy fit, soft to face and fits perfectly under the mask"
5.0,Very pretty ring. Just as described and fits very close to size. Was bigger than I expected. I bought it for my niece that loves sunflowers and she loves this ring. Arrived very fast.
5.0,"Quality fabric, soft and washes beautifully. Fits as expected. Fitted so I recommend hang-drying. Color as pictured. Low cut, but I've worn it with and without a tank underneath. (Military Olive, XS)"
5.0,Perfect for my 8‚Äù wrist. Nothing to complain about with 2 so far.
5.0,Honestly cant recommend ordering from here enough! The leather was great and the issue we did have they solved immediately.
5.0,"I ordered down a size (M) because I wanted extra support (32DDD).<br />Fits just the way I wanted, fairly supportive (not for sports/exercise other than yoga).  The band rolls up a bit at the bottom. But overall great bra."
5.0,I just love my pink lace dress.  I absolutely can't wait to wear it to my event.  I read a lot of reviews and was skeptical on getting the size 3X because I thought that it wouldn't fit because it says that it runs small.  Fits perfectly.  I weigh 240 pounds and I am 5'5&#34; tall.  I have a lot of butt as well.  It's not see through on the top like everyone else said.  It's only see through from the knees down.  I recommend this purchase to all of the curvy girls in the world. The only problem that I have is trying to find the perfect shoes to go with this beautiful dress.  Enjoy!!!!
5.0,im obsessed‚Äî i knew that i had to size up so i did. Usually a size medium in both top and bottome and ordered a large! It fit really nicely‚Äî got so many compliments! Really worth it
5.0,Super cute and fit perfectly! Will definitely order again.

5.0,Received as advertised -- no problem!
5.0,I think they work work great! Just ordered another pair for my friend!
5.0,"I am 3 months postpartum (c section) so I was looking for an undergarment that provides some compression on my abdomen. This works great! The material has a nice stretch. There is boning at the top which I was worried would dig into my skin but I haven‚Äôt had an issue so far. I really like this because I can wear it all day, it holds my belly in place and it‚Äôs not overly tight."
5.0,It is a very dazzling bracelet! I receive compliments every time I wear it!
5.0,"Love it! Very soft, light weight and comfortable!"
5.0,prfect
5.0,Very pretty ring.  I wear it on my middle finger.  Many compliments.  Recommend

5.0,"Great quality!  I bought as a gift for a friend and she loved them.  They are very long but the color is bright beautiful teal.  The metal at the top of the earring is detailed nicely and great quality.  Recommend these earrings, great price!"

5.0,Bought as Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it. Looks very nice and was easy to put together.
5.0,Perfect for my needs.  I ordered bifocals as I love to read when outside or at the beach.
5.0,I was afraid to try these funny but cute shoes. I finally did and I am pleasantly suprised! Cute comfy and i love the loafer look!
5.0,My son loves them.  He is only 3 and they fit as expected.  They have held up well so far.  He loves the design and they seem to be more comfortable then his other pairs.
5.0,"The masks are in good quality.<br /><br />Comfort: I worked in a dentist office as a dental assistant before, and these masks are just as comfortable as the ones I used at work.<br /><br />Quality:<br />Water Resistance - I have put water inside the masks (white side), and the middle layer stayed dry when I pour it out and cut the mask open to check.<br /><br />Meltblown Layer (middle layer) - After I cut the mask open, and separated the 3 layers, the middle layer is NOT thin like some of the knock off ones that you can see through them. The thickness of the middle layer is relatively even across the mask. Also, a very important function of the middle layer is to attract bacterias and viruses,  and this mask's middle layer is full of statics , which is great. When you touch it lightly with your finger, you can feel that it's attracted to your skin, when you let go, you can feel that it's trying to stay connected, and when you look at it under bright light,  you can see the fine fibers are all ""standing up"", reaching out to the direction of where your finger is (close to the mask but not touching it). I also burned the middle layer with fire, it melted as it should, not caught on fire.<br /><br />I cannot tell if these are medical grade or surgical grade of masks,  but for average civilians that are not first responders, I think they are good enough for using in public areas to help prevent the spread of diseases.<br /><br />Customer Service is GREAT:<br />I made multiple orders with this sellers, shipping to different addresses (family members at different locations). Most of them arrived within couple of weeks. Mine were presumably lost at the customs (still says label created, waiting for package on the USPS website, one and a half months after the shipment was sent). The seller reached out to me about 2 weeks before the far end of the estimated delivery date range, and let me know that they think the shipment might be lost given the tracking status. They volunteered to offer me 2 options, either a full refund immediately, or resend me the masks. I took the resend masks option, since we need the masks due to COVID-19. Seller immediately sent out the replacement orders, and shared the USPS tracking information with me as soon as they became available. In less than 2 weeks, my orders showed up at my door as the tracking information indicated (while the original orders' USPS tracking still says ""Label created, not yet in system."").<br /><br />I would order these masks again from this seller."
5.0,"It fits loose but I think it‚Äôs supposed to. Very comfortable. I love it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù3 , 130 lbs. small size is perfect."
5.0,Awesome product...!!!
5.0,These are awesome.  I get compliments all the time.  The polarization is nice to have in the car on a super sunny day.
5.0,Really good quality
5.0,This is big. Very sturdy and good quality. Liked it.
5.0,"My son loves this shirt and wears it daily.  It's a generous fit, which is good, so that he won't out grow it anytime soon.  Washes well, soft and comfortable."
5.0,Perfect 1920 party
5.0,What I ordered
5.0,Love this mask because it has a slip in the back to put in a N95 filter which is crucial today.
5.0,A great top.  I wear it all the time. Very comfy
5.0,"I love the design, but the ear pieces are too short for a man. So It was to late for me because I was not smart enough to see the unisex description, which should have told me something! If you are a woman fine, but beware gentlemen."
5.0,"Great fit, adjustable waist.  Nice quality, perfect for dressing up.  They still look good after washing, too."
5.0,It was very easy to assemble and put up. Only took me about 1/2 hour. And I am an older woman and did this alone. It is also vey easy and quick to adjust. Great purchase..
5.0,"yep, they're socks"
5.0,Perfect coat not to heavy but very warm
5.0,Really like the long length.  They stay put and  I also like that they are breathable cotton.
5.0,Great wallet. I love that it zips up securely. The plaid looks great with my black purse.
5.0,"Gotta admit, the Eye of Agamotto is awesome. Looks great and I enjoy wearing it. I forget sometimes I have it on and just take it everywhere. The quality in the craftsmanship is great for the price."
5.0,"Super cute shirt, fits well and it‚Äôs flattering! Had to order it in 2 colors."
5.0,"I love this product! I took the LightWalker onto the darkest street in my neighborhood and took pictures with my phone (attached). The photos are not retouched and show the three different brightness settings. As you can see, it really lights up the path so you can see exactly where you're stepping. No more twisted ankles or tripping for me!<br /><br />The hands-free operation is fantastic (I don't like to hold anything while I'm running). It also has a blinking reflector setting if you want to make sure that others can see you. The beam cast onto the street can be rotated up or down to adjust for people of different heights. Belt is easy to clip on and off. Uses common AAA batteries.<br /><br />This is such a simple, but excellent idea. I don't know how I ran at night before without it. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Great looking watch band.
5.0,When I got my sport bra I put it on and it feels amazing. I have never had a sports bra feel so comfortable and keep my breast in place they really do not move or bounce
5.0,These are the best socks. My husband purchased these for hunting and during those cold months it gets rather cold in PA. He lovers these socks and I do too lol. I wear them with leggings and they keep your feet really warm and are so comfortable. They don't ride down and are really thick and lined with so much fur. Great price and great product
5.0,Work perfect and are very comfortable.  I have an average size head and they fit like a glove.
5.0,Cute and fits!
5.0,Soft and gorgeous even after multiple washes.  Best robe I ever had.
5.0,"I was worried a little about the contoured nose part, as obviously not all faces are the same, but I worrying for nothing.  Very little to no light comes through!!  The elastic is adjustable (though, in my case, arrived already perfectly sized for me).  It's awesome you get TWO and both come with their own carrying pouch, for such a low price!  VERY happy with this purchase and WILL recommend!"
5.0,"I usually wear a size 7US panty and because there was no sizing on these panties I presumed they would probably have a pretty comfortable stretch capability. Alas, they do not. These panties would be better suited for a size 5/6US size lady. I gave these to my daughter who normally wears a size 5/6US and they fit her quite comfortably- no complaints. I still consider this a great buy fifteen pairs of panties will last a good while.<br /> I'm happy (:"
5.0,"I ordered the one that looked exactly like this from other sellers before. But, this one is far far amazing. Easy to wear, to adjust the links & a greater quality than any available on Amazon ‚ô•Ô∏è"
5.0,"I bought two for my son's wedding in July and they fit my two grandaughters perfectly. Very soft material, very light for a hot July outside wedding and a very pretty print. We are very satisfied."
5.0,Great fit and amazing quality!
5.0,so comfortable and cute!!
5.0,"Super cute, comfortable, and true to the size (at least it fits me like a glove)!"
5.0,So cute! Very nicely made and my daughter loves it
5.0,Love this backpack for my 9 year old! Shipped very fast! So happy with this purchase!
5.0,"Nice necklace. Goes with sweaters, suit jackets and many outfits."
5.0,I have two other pairs of these socks. I work two jobs - even during the current pandemic. You feel the support when you put these socks. My first job is in an office and I now have to sit or run from my desk area to another part of the office. I feel the support all day. The same when I work at my part time job in a retail store. I have the support I need when I move throughout the store. I will buy more and replace the rest of my old compression socks. Thank you.
5.0,Very comfy top! Perfect for sleep! Love it so much I ordered 3! I highly recommend!! üôå
5.0,Nice shirt keeps you cool
5.0,my boy friend likes them
5.0,"I love my dress, get so many compliments!!"
5.0,Very nice shoe.  Husband loves that they are very well made and can be worn inside or outside.  He threw out his other pair when he got these.  Worth the money.
5.0,"I have about 5 pair of these pants. They fit great and are a really good quality. They don't roll down, they stay put and don't restrict movement in any way. Also I am really short so it's hard to find pants that don't bunch up at the ankle, I find these work great as full length for me."
5.0,Bough this for a vacation at the beach and it did what I needed it to do- covered my bathing suit.
5.0,Necklace is lovely. Came beautifully cased and seller was very accomodating
5.0,Got this for our 6 year grandson's birthday.  He put it on immediately & headed out for a ride.  No better rating than that!
5.0,"I haven‚Äôt had a truly cold day yet to try it out but just from initially trying it on, I can see it being great for those bitter winter days when you can‚Äôt escape having to go outdoors for a while."
5.0,Awesome jersey for the price. Definitely giftable!
5.0,Exactly as expected- looks like an adorable smock on my 5‚Äô3‚Äù frame. I wear it to work and it‚Äôs super functional.
5.0,So far these are the warmest gloves I have found and they do appear to be water proof. I've worn them in light rain. They can even make your hands sweat but I cannot complain about that. It would be nicer though if the inner lining did not cling and try to come out with your hand as other reviews have mentioned.
5.0,"I bought three of these dresses.  They run a little small so I ordered a size up.  They are versatile,  washer/dryer friendly  and no wrinkles if you pull them out of dryer while hot."
5.0,This will last as a field pouch for years.
5.0,"Really is rain proof. Wrinkle resistant, great for traveling."
5.0,My daughter wore this on her wedding day in the Bahamas.  It was beautiful and fit perfect.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, exactly as pictured, great quality, great seller, great communication, fast ship!"
5.0,"This dress fit true to size, I love the way it flares and swing, the color is just as beautiful. I also have this in maroon and white."
5.0,I was very amazed how elegant and classy the brooch looks.  It was  just right height and width. Matched my gown and hair color.
5.0,love it. So pretty and shiny I can't wait to wear it.
5.0,"Awesome Watch, Easy to read"
5.0,Sent quickly abbd better quality than I expected
5.0,I love it. I just adopted a dog and the weather is changing and it works great under sweats. Keeps the cold air out and keeps me warm.
5.0,"This is a really pretty robe. Good fabric weight. The lace detail is actually soft, which surprised me, as I was concerned it would be somewhat scratchy/stiff. It is also a substantial width lace trim. They did not skimp on this detail. Bought the blue grey color and it is really lovely. Fit well and as expected."
5.0,The picture is just what you would expect when you order this dress.  I love it!  It's ethnic without being over the top.  I've worn it on two separate occasions which normally recommends formal attire.  I wore this dress instead and stood out in a positive way.  I would recommend this dress.
5.0,These are really nice hats I bought other colors.  Good price and I was able to gem stickers on them to spruce up for they are pretty but just needed a little bling.
5.0,"Beautiful blouse. But it is actually very loose. It's American sizing.p, Not Chinese. So if you buy large or extra large it will be really big."
5.0,"This is the third one of these I‚Äôve purchased. As a truck driver, my hoody gets worn hard and I wear it all year long. It gets dirty quickly, and has held up to frequent washings in hot water with no fading. It‚Äôs warm enough for walking across parking lots in severe weather, the hood is deep enough to actually stay on my head, and the pockets are large enough to actually put my hands in when I need to. The zipper is a sturdy metal. No down side that I can see. When the time comes, I‚Äôll get another, I‚Äôm sure."
5.0,"Exactly what I expected. They don't seem cheap at all, which I was worried about. I would recommend this."
5.0,"I purchased the brown purse and it is much lighter than what was depicted in the pictures.However, it is still a gorgeous bag that I can pair with a multitude of outfits. Lots of storage and the handles are beautiful decorated. I can't wait to wear it out! Great price and fast shipping. To say the least, I will be purchasing at least one more in a different color in the near future.<br />Update: I loved my brown purse so much that I purchasd the burgundy one!"
5.0,Beautiful ring!  Great quality.
5.0,Rose Gold glasses are the Bomb dot com! It really is polarized. I love the look and its very comfortable to wear. It fits just perfect. I'll be purchasing more. Thank you!!
5.0,Perfect! Great quality and absolutely adorable.
5.0,Muy buena chaqueta para invierno

5.0,Perfect as a cover up!
5.0,"Everything. Color,fit well"
5.0,Package came sooner than expected. Ordered size<br />Medium. It‚Äôs Light weight and good for spring weather. Pretty good quality and color is exact to the advertised picture. I‚Äôll definitely order again.
5.0,"Heavy duty, works well, made well!"
5.0,They are super pretty and came super fast!!
5.0,This size fits loosely which I like in this type of fabric.  I usually wear a size 2x in department store clothes.  The shirt is light and airy and looks nice. I have not worn this shirt yet. Nice shirts.
5.0,The night light can help you a lot when walking either with your pet or alone.
5.0,It was just what my 10 year old daughter needed. She loved it!!!!
5.0,"Great product, well packaged exactly as pictured"
5.0,Love it. IT was a gift and she loved it.
5.0,I loved my pop beads as a child and am hoping to please another generation with similar gifts.  Each bag of beads will make about four strands of child size beads.
5.0,excellent product!
5.0,"Nice , comfortable and lots of pockets"
5.0,Would highly recommend. Good quality and very stylish. Works well with touch screen. They run a little big so size down if unsure of size.
5.0,"Finally found a cute, sturdy pair of affordable sunglasses on here! Most I find are too big or just not as pictured. These are perfectly large, snug, and cute!"
5.0,"Such a nice dress.  Very classy for work, church, or after work dinner.  Will be ordering more colors."
5.0,"Este vestido es muy hermoso, sin embargo corre peque√±o, compre una talla 5 para mi hija de 4 a√±os y qued√≥ peque√±o, tuve que pedir un 7."
5.0,Everything was great about the tanks
5.0,I really liked tht finally my afro could fit under a cap!!!
5.0,Great Detail!
5.0,Works as advertised. Good product!
5.0,One of my favorite shades
5.0,"Love this bathing suit! Bottoms are a little cheeky, but not too bad. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 125lbs and the medium fit perfect."
5.0,"Beautiful dress! Awesome price! My daughter is 6 years and 8 months old. She is 4ft tall and her waist is 22 inches. I bought the dress in a size 10. She loves to wear her dresses long and puffy, and I love to buy her dresses a few sizes bigger so she can enjoy them for a while.<br /><br />The waist fits perfect! The length is perfect as well. The chest area is a little loose but it can be easily fixed with small darts or safety pins."
5.0,"It Is beautiful, good  quality,  delivery is fast"
5.0,"Super excited for these. They are cute. Individually packaged may have been better for my purposes, but otherwise I am more than satisfied with them."
5.0,"I go through umbrellas very fast. Mostly because I put them in sleeves in a salt water pool. I've gone through a variety, and I now have three Tempera umbrellas. My oldest one has held up incredibly well. The fabric doesn't fade like less expensive umbrellas and most importantly, the bodies are aluminum and not iron. This makes them both lighter weight, but also much better in handling wet environments. The iron umbrellas always end up rusting out, even with the powder coating.<br /><br />This Tempera umbrella was super easy to assemble, it literally took 30 seconds. The tilt mechanism is a manual one which is less ideal than the crank one, but if you want a crank style, the 10' Tempera offers that.<br /><br />I really like the beige color, it's the perfect shade. I really highly recommend Tempera umbrellas!"
5.0,"Love them, second pair"
5.0,"The piece is gorgeous!  I however was hesitant on ordering what I thought might be an accurate size going by the seller's help which was a the smaller one than I chose. Based on reviews and photos, I sized up, I don't know what I was thinking by ordering the XL.  Laces fully gathered and it is just too large for me. If it helps and anyone I am 32 inches under bust, 28 waist and 34 inches at the hip bone. When it comes to writing reviews it would be helpful if people try to provide measurements and also to be truthful about their size, they do not have to provide a real name."
5.0,Will hold together well if shrink washed (hot wash and heat dry or quick dry).
5.0,Beautiful colors and great fit. Runs slightly large so size down. Ordered more already. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and weigh 145. Medium was to big but small is perfect!! Definitely recommend.
5.0,"Reasonable quality, gave a much better look and feel to my watch."
5.0,Very soft and perfect for Christmas Pj's for my teen boys.
5.0,Cute and sturdy
5.0,Item received on time and as described.
5.0,Very comfortable; great fit
5.0,"Was nervous to order a product with no reviews, but given the price I had to give it a go.  They are awesome!!  I received them today, so I don‚Äôt know long term wear and tear but they are meant to be worn under clothes so either way I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll like them for a while.  Ordering more pairs now!!"
5.0,"This dress fits me like a glove!<br />I am 53 yo- 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 134lbs, 36 D - Still have a figure but not as tone as once was.  A reference to help you with sizing.<br />Very flattering and classy dress for any occasion."
5.0,It is in great condition box wasn't smashed.
5.0,"I saw these sunglasses on a influencers IG and was curious. Typically, what you see is not always what you get, but in this case, they turned out better than I thought they would. They do you look designer from the side and straight on. I ended up getting the two pack, both black, and they‚Äôre great for travel sunglasses if you don‚Äôt want to bring your expensive designer ones. Good quality, darkness for lens, and price. Note, they are oversized, but fit great. 5-Stars and definitely recommend adding to your collection."
5.0,Very cute boot that looks like it cost a lot more that $30!
5.0,Another beautiful creation from Janasya.. gorgeous color n print.. fits perfectly. I don‚Äôt need to look anywhere else for my ethnic wear shopping when Janasya is there !! Thank you for prompt delivery :)
5.0,I really like this item. It‚Äôs super soft and cozy!
5.0,I bought this for my 6 YO son for camp. My boys hate bugs in their faces so this is the perfect solution for both sun and bugs. He loves it.
5.0,Amazing Design
5.0,"Tried to buy another,  I like so much"
5.0,"Finally put on my new belt today. Good quality stylish belt. I love the smell of new leather. This belt doesn't disappoint. It is extremely easy to put on, take off, and adjust (can all be done with one hand). The ratcheting buckle is a great design and so easy to use. The buckle is well casted and the design is nice. The look and feel of the leather is smooth and the stitching is perfect. They did a good job dying/tanning and preparing the leather before it turned into a nice belt. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. For someone who usually looks for functionality before style/fashion, I'm glad I picked a belt that does both so well. The belt can be put on with one hand (with a bit of practice). It can also be taken off with one hand, and quite easily I might add (no practice required). The racheting system is well engineered. Great belt. Works great and looks good doing it."
5.0,"Im 5'10&#34; 155 lbs.  That is to say, skinny.  My legs are a bit thin even for my weight.  I bought the L and am very satisfied with the fit.  I have no interest in these fitting like compression shorts, and at L, in my size, they do not.  If you want them to feel that way, at my size get a M.  They are quite tight and close to the skin without compressing.  The drawstring is solid and despite the non-compression I seriously doubt I'd have trouble with these coming off in a dive.  I bought the Red/Navy.  My only complaint is that the top is lower on my waist than, say, my usual Volcom or Hurley board shorts, so that feels strange.  This is the style of Jammers, however, and I'll definitely get used to it.  I think they look great.  I don't care to grab attention, so I only wish they were more popular in the USA.  Also, wish I didn't skip leg day."
5.0,The product arrived promptly and in careful packaging. I will use the keychain with a Red Sox key. Now all that is needed is a Red Sox comeback and World Series win in 2020!
5.0,Excellent value! Took these to the snow for an entire day and they stayed dry and warm.
5.0,Es hermosa econ√≥mica y buen producto
5.0,La compre para regalarsela a mi padre en EU y le gusto. Muy bonita
5.0,This was used in place of a face mask. It was more comfortable and easier to breathe.
5.0,"A large square, adds warmth as well as color"
5.0,Kids liked it
5.0,My friend loved the ring.  Thanks for such quick service.
5.0,"Good quality and nicely distressed leather give it a pleasant, old-school and relaxed feel.  Metal inserts in the end loops to make feeding the pins easier.  Nice touch.  Be careful though:  the brushed steel clasp is huge.  This band is best suited for a large man."
5.0,I ordered this suite with the pink flower print for a cruise and it was perfect! The style is cute and comfortable. If you are not use to a suite that ties around your neck it may feel a little restrictive.
5.0,no issues nice item
5.0,Love how lightweight yet durable !<br />Great quality.
5.0,"Bought wife for Christmas, she loves them more then her under amour pair. Wears them all the time. Loves the pockets."
5.0,This is a beautiful set. Love it!!
5.0,Know someone who always loses their keys?? Perfect!
5.0,This thing is gorgeous. The photo doesn't give it justice at all.
5.0,"This a charming little ring is so cute, it looks great on and I'm happy with my purchase."
5.0,Very nice detailed lace and embroidery as shown in photos. Fits well. Bottoms run on the small side .Got this in 10 days from ordering!<br />Looks nice on and has separate padding which is removable. Great quality. Got the one in red as well.
5.0,Delivered on time and performs as described.
5.0,These masks make it easy for my family to breathe ! Love it thanks !
5.0,Awesome print & quality. I have several of these pouches for different things and love them!!
5.0,"I love this turtleneck! The material is great, it fits perfect and I love the slits on the sides!"
5.0,"42 yr old, 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 184lbs top heavy, respectable apple bottom...Only wore it twice but I love it. Not a fan of the 2xl sizing since I normally wear a 10/12 or m/l/xl in American women‚Äôs sizes. Top heavy (38DDD) with a medium frame. Did gain some water weight from pain medication so now I‚Äôm pushing into the large/x-large clothing category. This 2xl fits me well on my upper woman parts and fits with room on the thighs and torso. Not too baggy but the fit is different in the top than the bottom. But that‚Äôs a me thing. So if you‚Äôre not top heavy and you normally wear a m/l, go down a size from this 2xl.<br /><br />The material is great as well. I use the pool more for therapy. Think it will last a season or two maybe more.<br /><br />Also, I love it because it‚Äôs a one piece and I still feel like I‚Äôm sporting my curves without revealing more than that (you know, all the back fat). Definitely recommend."
5.0,Very cute bathing suit.
5.0,Totally loving this skirt and the fit.  The design is so gorgeous and I absolutely love the bright colors.OUTSTANDING!!!!
5.0,Amazing  looks good and fits awesome
5.0,Great product fit perfect ordered another one
5.0,Best locs I‚Äôve had
5.0,Beautiful my daughter loves them
5.0,"It is amazing and everything I expected. Good gold finish, looks exactly like the one in The Pirates of the Caribbean."
5.0,"I use these when wearing contacts, especially when I'm doing any sort of outdoors activity like Scuba Diving. The lenses are very clear and sharp, the frames are very comfortable. The earpieces adjust several ways, angle and length, so no matter what shape your noggin is in, it should fit like a glove."
5.0,Great quality. Beautiful dress.
5.0,Beautiful summer color's! Fits great and the pockets are great.
5.0,Love it.  Great fit.
5.0,Love these hoodies have in two colors great material soft comfortable and got so many compliments
5.0,"In am 5'9 220 and got an xxl. I normally wear a 16. It fit perfect. I fully expeced to wear it as a shirt but it is long enough to wear as a dress with flats!  Good quality,  construction and material is good.  I want it in black"
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Adds flair to any outfit
5.0,This one turned out to be nicer than I thought very well made for a cheap price
5.0,Easy to find my glasses now!
5.0,their grate
5.0,I am happily surprised. I would like to find a longer version of this same dress even. I will buy additional colors. You can dress it up or down it is perfect.<br /><br />Only down side it doesn't have pockets
5.0,This is my favorite sweater that I got for Christmas this year. I have the camel colored one. I plan to get the grey one too. I just wish there were more color options!
5.0,I like it and I get a lot of comments on it.  Wish the chain was a little longer but other that I would not change anything.
5.0,My kids and their friends loved these for a school theme day!
5.0,High quality  this is my second purchase.. still have other pair. But my other daughter wanted a pair too. So we got purple this time
5.0,It is what the picture shows. I love it.
5.0,Nice hat!! Like that‚Äôs flat bill
5.0,"These are fantastic.  They fit exactly as expected, have a great color, feel amazingly soft and warm.  I absolutely love them.  I only wear them to take out trash, check the mail or maybe even a quick trip in and out of the car at the corner store, but I love them.<br /><br />Would highly recommend these to anybody looking for a nice easy to slip on house shoe / slipper."
5.0,"Looks great, not to bulky and not to thin. The appearance gives the strap a higher quality look without the sacrifice of being over priced."
5.0,"Nice, clear, smooth glass. Will buy again"
5.0,Love this dress! I wore it to my husband's Christmas party.
5.0,So great product but I need to order a size down. I'm normally a medium in pants but I need a small!
5.0,Loved it.  Subtle and yet makes a statement.  Would order again
5.0,This is by far my best purcahse on Amazon! Just when i'd given up on finding the perfect bag for all my accessories tablet and laptop I found this. It holds everything you need to get through the day and looks really elegant. The interior has a strong material and lovely layout. I'm totally in love with it . I will definitely buy this again (hopefully not soon ) üíìüíì
5.0,The dress is very beautiful and classy.<br />It does run big though. I‚Äôm 32DD and size XS was way too lose in the bust/shoulder area.<br />I highly recommend it for someone that fits the measurements better!
5.0,"This band is super. Fit my watch perfectly. Very easy to install. Should b standard on all watches. My wrist tends to swell frequently and this band makes it so easy to readjust. More comfortable, allows airflow to minimize sweat build up. Would recommend to anyone."
5.0,"Just what I was looking for, they stay on your foot."
5.0,"I bought this pajama set after my friend showed me a pair. They are great for lounging and perfect for traveling. Super soft and comfortable....stylish too. I washed them in a delicate mesh bag with my normal laundry and hung to dry.  My husband loved them on me. (I'm 5' 4"", 140 pounds and purchased a size small....fit nicely with plenty of room.)"
5.0,"Idk why the other reviewer is so mad, but I love my rings.  The gold is worn off, but I've been wearing them for 2 years, so... to be expected.  I wear them as pinkie rings, not midis.  The rings are sterling,  stamped, nice."
5.0,"As described, cool toned pale pink color. I recommend going a size down as it looks better fitted on the body. Very useful with the hood and being so long."
5.0,Perfect for wearing during yhis covid outbreak I can wipe them down after clinic and I can match them to my scrubs
5.0,"I am a long-time fan of Derek Alexander bags, and this one has not disappointed. The quality is excellent.<br /><br />I normally carry a smaller bag, but when I faced cancer treatments, I wanted to have more supplies and medical papers with me for all appointments, plus my tablet and its charger for entertainment during long waits.  This fits the bill. It has convenient places to organize for all those extra items, as well as the usual purse content. I especially like the two readily-available outside drop pockets, which I use for the cell phone and for parking cards.<br /><br />When my treatments end, I may go back to my smaller bag (also a Derek Alexander). Or not."
5.0,"The latch hook is actually on the opposite side of where the chain dangles; instead of right next to it as pictured, but I still love it because it dangles right on top of my foot.  Very sexy in a pair of pumps üëçüëç"
5.0,Amazing headbands. Love them
5.0,"SUPER soft, they don't slip in my shoes/boots, and they breathe really well in heat and humidity. I wish they sold them in larger bundles, I would buy them by the truckload if I could. I'm a Farmer, so it has been really hard to find socks that work well in my muck boots, and then just as nicely in my casual shoes. I have ordered these twice now, and will keep doing so whenever I have a little extra cash."
5.0,I had very little expectations for this dress to be honest. I bought it for our 10 year anniversary photos and the only reason I got it was because it had prime shipping. I used the size chart that the store provides and it was just a hair big. It is an absolutely gorgeous gown and looks like it came from a boutique. So incredibly happy with this dress and cannot wait to wear it!
5.0,really beautiful necklace! I love it and get compliments on it every time I wear it
5.0,The bag is mage well and I love things upcycled. Plan to have a custom bag made from my old license plate.
5.0,I just wanted a little change in straps other than the one that came with my Itouch.  Fits great and was easy to put on
5.0,"Cute glasses! Made for excellent party favors for a group party. Actually looked good on almost everyone- we thought it was going to be just for fun/ one silly pic, but people ended up wearing them the whole weekend!"
5.0,This bodysuit is awesome! I didn‚Äôt know what to expect for sizing. I‚Äôm a size 8/medium and I ordered the xl and it fits well. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you are any larger than an 8. I look terrible in bodysuits so I paired it with a tutu. I love that it‚Äôs unique and I won‚Äôt have the same costume as anyone else. I highly recommend it.
5.0,Super soft and great fit!  Very versatile - can be casual with leggings or pair with heels and a statement piece. Will be buying more colors!
5.0,"This dress is a great buy, it fits great (true to size, I'm an xl and bought an xl, fits perfect ) fabric is great, I loved it so much I bought another in a different color!"
5.0,It is a cool design.  There are pockets that is essential.
5.0,I bought these for my kids and they fit my two-year-old and seven-year-old perfectly and funny thing they fit my face perfectly I find these to be more snug to my face than the adult ones
5.0,very easy to breathe
5.0,Have received so many compliments ‚ò∫ ... mask not too heavy and super comfy... considering its a mask!!
5.0,good fit i like it
5.0,"Perfect size bag! Just got it today, and I can't wait to carry it. Seems to be well made. Time will tell!"
5.0,Cute shirt for back to school! Arrived quickly! Washed nicely and fit was super!
5.0,"Love it, it‚Äôs perfect"
5.0,"Great value, these deploy quickly and seem to be just as good of quality as far more expensive poles. Looking forward to my next ultra with these!"
5.0,Perfect gift for my dad!
5.0,It shapes body really prettily. It is not uncomfortable like the usual shapewears. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit. I also like it as i dont have to wear bra under it. It has a pretty good support
5.0,Facil de usar y nadie se imagina que est√° escuchando musica
5.0,Very pretty. Nice quality.
5.0,"Fit as expected,  great item."
5.0,"Love love love this dress. I was super skeptical about purchasing a wedding dress online. Have no fear. This dress is as described. You will need your MOH to help you I to the dress. But once tied in, it's gorgeous"
5.0,"This is a beautiful necklace, great quality and price!"
5.0,"they fit great, the colors are great too!"
5.0,"Precious dress! I have a different one in the same shape and knew I needed this in green!<br /><br />TTS. Careful! It‚Äôs a bit short- even in my shorter frame. For your reference, I ordered a small and my personal measurements are:<br />Bust: 35<br />Waist: 29<br />Hips: 36<br />Height: 5‚Äô4<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful! If it was, would you be so kind to mark it as such? Also, if you appreciate this review and enjoy other great deals, I‚Äôd love to connect with YOU! Come say hello on FB/IG!  Happy shopping, friends! @prettycheapmama"
5.0,It was a little fitted in the thigh area but so pretty!
5.0,I struggle finding sunglasses but these are cute on. I have a smaller face and they are a good fit for me. I think the polarization might take a little to get used to.
5.0,I love these! i would most definately order again. They are so comfortable and a very cute alternative to regular trouser socks.
5.0,"Got these for my daughter for Christmas and she accidently stepped on one and broke the post off.  She was devastated as she had gotten lots of compliments on them!  So, got her another pair for her birthday!"
5.0,I like the colorful pattern
5.0,"Love it, it's really pretty and good quality"
5.0,"Absolutely fabulous earrings, my new favorites for all occasions. They are made pretty solid but look very sophisticated."
5.0,The watch is so elegant and beautiful. I had to adjust the bracelet but I do not mind since I am not the standard size.
5.0,My husband loved the tie. Wore it to our holiday party and received many compliments
5.0,These are cute and comfy and much cheaper than other ones we've seen.  Which is nice when they only fit for such a short period of time on a growing child.
5.0,"Son is a camper he loved this , made a perfect Christmas gift"
5.0,Very nice product. My son loves it.
5.0,Love these headwraps!  My son has also stolen a couple from me.  Sonia
5.0,My teenage daughter looked adorable in this dress. It was just at her knee and she's about 5:3. Best of all she loved it!
5.0,Got these to pair with 1 Direction concert tickets for my granddaughter!  She is going to love them!  Can not wait to give them to her!
5.0,Perfect for the summer time
5.0,Cute little summer dress.  Has enough give in the fabric that it fits well for busty women.
5.0,"I tried it on for the first time and I fell in love with it. So breathable and comfortable. It‚Äôs really stretchy so if you get a size smaller don‚Äôt worry it will still fit. Also the fabric feels nice and secure, not see through at all."
5.0,"Cap was perfect great price, shipping and arrival time perfect, thanks."
5.0,The original watch bands with this model watch are rubber and tend to break. This leather band seems more sturdy and fits well. It has been 3 months now and the band is holding up well
5.0,My daughter loves it. Great qualityüëçüèº
5.0,"I cannot be any more satisfied with my order! Got my son a personalized belt, it is beautiful craftsmanship and arrived so quickly! Mailed out same day as I ordered. Messaged seller for a brief question and she was was incredibly sweet and quick to respond! I am so happy with everything! Plus small business here in the USA is the best."
5.0,Quality stay-dry fabric. Nice design print as advertised. Comfortable. Spot-on for standard US size fit.<br /><br />Better than expected.
5.0,As described. Absolutely love it! Fast shipping!
5.0,Great Item for the price LOVE IT!
5.0,Bought this for my son to put his softballs in<br />It‚Äôs lightweight enough but durable
5.0,"I love the material, great quality. (Just machine wash cold and air dry, no dryer!) they fit my body very nicely for a &quot;tight&quot; look. I am 5'3, 115 lbs, usually a size 2. I ordered the x-small. I will be buying other colors right now!  Fit perfectly."
5.0,"I love the color and the feel. It is on the smaller size (I purchased a medium, I am 5'6'' with no boobs) -- the sleeve length was on the short side which made the cut over the shoulders feel tight. Oh -- after washing once in cold water and drying it on low, it shrunk substantially. I would say this hoodie is just meh overall..."
5.0,Well made and offers a lot of coverage.  Very comfortable as well.
5.0,"I fell in love with this painting when I saw it in the National Gallery in Scotland, and I have been trying to find a mouse pad with this image on it for a couple of years.  The image on the mouse pad is clear, and the proportions of the image are very good (i.e., not distorted looking from the original painting).  The size of the mouse pad is perfect.  It's also thick, which I like, and I think it will hold up well.  I like to use items that are both beautiful and functional, and this fits the bill.  I like mine so much that I'm ordering another for an art loving friend."
5.0,My son loves the sweater!!!
5.0,Well made. Survived 4 trips with my 4 daughters already and they absolutely love them.
5.0,"Was exactly what I expected it to be.  On a down side, it is slightly heavier than the watch I put it on.  So, I do I have to gingerly place it on the charging cradle to make sure that it charges over night."
5.0,"Fits great, and is very practical for choir performances."
5.0,I love everything about this belt.  Great fit for jeans!  Stitching and material is classy!
5.0,"So soft, not too big neck area, and perfect waist, I hate too tight elastic. Oh and did I say soft as soft can be"
5.0,Beautiful and I love it. I wear it every day.
5.0,They were going I loved it
5.0,Haven‚Äôt used it yet but it looks good
5.0,LOVE-LOVE-LOVE!
5.0,Very cute. Exactly as pictured. Not to lightweight. Perfect for whimsical bracelet:-)
5.0,Looks just as pictured. Good quality
5.0,"Flattering and versatile. Goes with jeans/shorts, or a sundress and sandals."
5.0,I was very happy with the quality of this nike and it come with original nike box
5.0,Live this watch band. Super comfortable and stylish. Makes it look more like a real watch!  Can‚Äôt wait to order more bands from this company!
5.0,"One of the best hats I have ever purchased.  Sizing is good for me, as I have a large head (7 7/8) and most ""one size fits all"" hats are hopelessly to small.  Fabric is very high quality, wicks well. Folding bill seemed odd, but actually works very well so the hat folds into a pocket nicely.  Add the loop for hanging, and roomy shape so you stay warm, and this is a terrific product. I own three of them (green, beige, and black) and wear them all the time.  A bit hot for hiking in Summer would be my only complaint..."
5.0,"bought this in camo also I loved it that much. great features, warm by itself in above freezing weather, great to layer under a proper jacket/parka. Have been wearing it 6 months and have noticed no quality issues. May even buy it again in another color. Shipped from UK and arrived quickly. Pretty standard 'tactical' styling that seems increasingly popular these days but I still love it."
5.0,Perfect for my designs!
5.0,"I loved the t-shirt, great quality I washed it alot and the print still looks brand new, the fabric is really nice and soft."
5.0,"I love them!!! They are a bit see through, but I‚Äôll take it for how great the fit is! I‚Äôm 5.1 and the length is perfect and they are not  too tight."
5.0,"My 5, almost 6 year old is on the skinny side. I got him a M size. It fits without looking too tight. I think it helped him because I didn't get another note from his teacher about his lack of focus or keeping his hands to himself. I know it's not going to get rid of his attention/focus or hyper behaviors, but I think it helped reduce it and that's all he needed."
5.0,"Started using these socks to help improve my recovery time from work. They did a great job, they also helped with muscle fatigue and cramping if I wear them during the day while I'm actively hiking/running."
5.0,Just like advertised!
5.0,"These are solid quality, they also clamp 3 different levels of tightness. Nipples, and ears worked well for."
5.0,Cuter in person!!!
5.0,"Worked great for my Weird Al costume, excellent!"
5.0,"Great sandals, very comfortable and light.  Bought them just for backpacking but now wear them more than any of my other shoes."
5.0,For valentine's<br />7 months pregnant was looking for a fitting dress t
5.0,Really liked the dress and comfortable fit. But it is a little thicker then I would have liked for Hawaii.
5.0,There short
5.0,Great size and attractive. All my stuff fits in it easily and I carry it everywhere!
5.0,Great watch so far!
5.0,I purchased the black with tortoise sunglasses and they‚Äôre super cute on and don‚Äôt look cheap at all!
5.0,"These are exactly as described and they stay on!!  I am a teacher aide and I wear them all day, every day and they do not fall off or slip. They are cut perfectly and can't be seen with your shoes on. I forget I have them on!"
5.0,Bought this for my kiddo. Works as described. Pictures kinda indicate that you might be able to use these for glasses that is incorrect. Perfect for your mask tho.
5.0,"Very pretty deep red color. Great quality, have received compliments already.Makes finding keys in a purse much easier."
5.0,Very happy with this shirt. It fits as expected.
5.0,"Love the dress, got lots of compliments.  The dress has a some stretch to it, not much, but enough for it to fit your curves.  I bought two, one I wore to a fashion show and the other to a wedding, I got lots of compliments I wore it to a fashion show and got lots of compliments. The dress looks nice with or without a petticoat, but I think its the petticoat that really makes the dress.  I would definitely recommend to others."
5.0,We purchased both the green and the pink floral blouses with the ripped jeans for our niece and they are the cutest!<br /><br />They both fit nicely on her and because my husband is from the old school he has to sew on extra patches underneath because he didn‚Äôt want her diaper/onesie showing!  Funny man!
5.0,"Great quality and beautiful, just like the picture. Received in timely fashion. Highly recommended."
5.0,"Really great product, exactly as hoped."
5.0,Vest definitely makes me sweat a lot more.
5.0,"Large fits like a large, true to size, good thick padding"
5.0,Exactly as described. perfect fit.
5.0,"I was afraid about the quality of this dress and am very relieved! It is truly beautiful on my daughter. It was a bit long, but that just means it will last her longer! I hope the quality lasts!"
5.0,"Great for entertaining board kids!I bought this for one of my kiddos who now has her own kiddo. I‚Äôve had one since my youngest, now 25, was about two years old.  I can‚Äôt say how many times it has saved us at dinner, on a plane, anywhere else that kids are bored to death. I‚Äôve even handed one to a stranger‚Äôs kids And it‚Äôs amazing how quickly they quiet down with something to fascinate them. They‚Äôre not expensive, so I have no fear of handing mine away and buying another one when I get back from my trip. It‚Äôs worth every bit of the cost to have a quiet dinner or flight!"
5.0,"In all my years of rocking earrings I have seen many styles of them. Many shapes. Many materials. Numerous options to choose from. So as I was navigating through Amazon, these ear jewels appeared. After taking a closer look I realized that these are pyramid earrings. Just when I thought I had worn every available style of earring, boom pyramids!!! Images of pyramids then raced through my head. Egypt. Mexico. Antarctica. The mystery behind the pyramids. Who built them? How were they built? ..... Awesome!!!!! ... So I thought why not have my lobes decorated with one of the wonders of the earth. So of course I ordered them. When they arrived they did not disappoint. The pyramid earrings were exactly as pictured. The earrings are stainless steel and about 7.5 mm. They accent the ears wonderfully. Not too flashy. Just classy. Also they are very flat when on the ears. Many of the other earrings I have worn protrude from the lobe a bit. These pyramids not so much. Which is nice so they don't snag on things. So the bottom line is if your looking for something new to wear for your lobes, at this price how can you say no."
5.0,I bought a fitness tracker on Amazon about a year ago for my daughter. It came with 2 bands that could be switched out. She wears it every day and the bands got discolored and dirty. We couldn't wash them very well. This blue band fit her tracker and works great. I wish there were more colors to choose from!
5.0,"Nice, laces, not shoes, no arch support...why did they ask that?"
5.0,I bought it second time
5.0,Very Comfortable! I would have maybe purchased 1 size Larger though!

5.0,"came faster than expected. they look dope, really liked them."
5.0,"I bought these for my daughters teacher for Christmas, he loves them! He wore them on his first day back from Christmas break."
5.0,"My three year old granddaughter loved the nightgown. She doesn‚Äôt want to take it off, which is a good thing cause it‚Äôs pretty enough to wear out."
5.0,"These belts are reversable, so you also can cut them to your size the buckle is removable. you just cut your size at the buckle end, and put the buckle back on...since the buckle is removable you can use another belt, but that one you would have to cut the buckle off.  nice value for the money..for a Ferragamo belt your looking $300+."
5.0,This looks quite stunning on.  It hangs well and it's very comfortable to wear.
5.0,"The lens color is just right; keeps out the glare, but still allows me to see color, and inside car. They look good,and the clip and flip up are excellent."
5.0,"I have a large head and this fits comfortably, which is tough for me to find. Thank you."
5.0,It wa great!
5.0,"They're flexible, which is huge.  Easy on, easy off."
5.0,Cover has multiple pockets to carry IDs/credit cards and SIM cards.
5.0,"I love it, it was a hit with an all white outfit"
5.0,They're comfortable and fit pretty well. I'm 5'4&#34; weigh 135lbs and got a medium. The only thing I'm not too thrilled about is that it does give you a camel toe. Maybe a size bigger perhaps?
5.0,The size was as stated and fit perfectly and arrived early. I wore it to a luau instead of a Hawaiian shirt and everyone loved it.
5.0,"As a working woman inv my late fiftIes, I can no longer wear high heels everyday. These look stylish enough that I don't feel drab and dowdy!  I have some brown Ugg slippers too and I love them also! Sheepskin feels awesome!"
5.0,I bought this as a gift for someone. It was very good quality at an even better price!
5.0,"No dislikes, arrived very quickly, fit and perfect for the occasion"
5.0,"Well made, good weight, I have the green plaid and love it."
5.0,This item is as described. Works great with the mask I purchased.
5.0,"Very nice! Very sturdy and the material is thick and strong. We have strong winds and past umbrellas always tore up within a year (collapsed) but the material used on this one its almost like canvas. And the tilt feature is terrific. Its also been out in the sun all SoCal summer and the color has yet to show signs of fading. Another good note, the bar splits in the middle making for easy storage during the winter months!"
5.0,This bracelet was exactly as described.  It is sturdy and very well made.  Not cheap at all.  I bought this for my 94 year old grandmother and she just loved it.  I would definitely recommend this bracelet.  It makes a great gift and comes in a nice black jewelry bag.
5.0,"I received so many compliments, very pretty!"
5.0,I really liked the high waist. Comfortable fit.
5.0,Bought for granddaughter she really loves them they fit great and look awesome. She adores the fact that they have pockets.

5.0,"This is a great charm to represent our time in disney as a birthday celebration for my daughter.  The metal quality was a little poor as it started to tarnish, but it is still a good addition."
5.0,very nice pendant.
5.0,Excellent collection!!! Perfect size!
5.0,"A cute salwar set ... The fit is perfect , and got delivered on time ..."
5.0,Gift for my dad and he loved it!  Very good material!
5.0,When I say I loooove these pants! I get compliments on them when I wear to work or church. Love the fabric .. I don‚Äôt have much hips 25‚Äù waist 34‚Äù hip - 105lbs ‚Äî I  have more butt than hips but the pockets somehow make it look like I have a little hip. Lol the way the waist wraps makes me look like I have some curves! I need more colors for sure! Oh and these pants are LONG! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and I HAVE to wear 4‚Äù heels with them.
5.0,"These shoes were purchase for a boy with cerebral palsy. He needed shoes large enough for him to wear his capos (leg braces). These shoes which were a big large lengthwise, were just what we needed width wise. And because he does not walk were perfect."
5.0,This was an amazing christmas present at an affordable price!
5.0,I was thinking they may be stiff uncomfortable.  I was wrong.  Love them so nice!!
5.0,this is a surprisingly nice bag.
5.0,"It looks great. Present was loved, and worn with pride with saying."
5.0,Have had for about a month now and still in great shape. Took on a trip and was very hard on it. Held a lot of heavy items with no wear and tear. Love all the pockets. Nice that you can wipe off exterior too.
5.0,It is very soft. Touch like silk but with pretty good stretch. Make me look like 5lbs less!
5.0,"Very cool! I want it, but it's a gift. : ("
5.0,"Absolutely Positively Beautiful! Originally I intended to purchase one for my GDaughter only, but thought I would get one and we could match :). Great Move on my part! Now I am purchasing another for my Daughter-in-Law and I few extras just in case one gets lost, my GDaughter is 5 yoa.<br />I'm wearing the size 3 on my pinky finger, my GDaughter (chubby little fingers) a size 5 on her ring finger. A pinky would be much too easy for her to lose.<br />Now look at the matching earrings, be careful buy the same rose from the same supplier. Trust me the earrings are just as pretty (for lack of a better word). These small items are detailed, have a antique flare and so different. One trip to the store and I came  home with so many compliments.<br />Please for the $$$, this is a no brainer!  I will now head over to the earrings and write my review for them .. you can guess what will be said. Have a good day, Be Safe."
5.0,Very classy looking cross and chain. Lots of complements whenever and wherever I wear this nice cross/chain combination.nice
5.0,It was good as expected
5.0,These are really great for the price!
5.0,Nice boots but they run big. I have to wear thick socks
5.0,"Love these socks, very comfortable. Got these as a gift and a pair for myself. Would buy again."
5.0,"Honestly what more can you ask for!? I wanted a low cost pair of sun glasses to keep in my car that were polarized.  I must say I was thoroughly surprised that they were polarized, sturdy and so inexpensive.  You will be impressed and they look very stylish!"
5.0,Great for kids party
5.0,This outfit is so precious!! Size 4
5.0,Runs small so reordering!
5.0,Sweatshirt as pictured. Great buy. Shipping was fast. Would buy again.
5.0,I used this product to Alleviate swelling And comfort for my legs.
5.0,"I received these and they are just fine, but I mistakenly ordered a slightly smaller size than I intended. These wonderful to use pendant trays come in a few sizes, from 25 mm to 30 mm to 38 mm to 50 mm. I prefer the 38 mm size because I can match it with an exact size craft punch. I work on either aluminum foil (kitchen foil) , Yupo paper (which takes alcohol inks beautifully) or any variety of light stock colorful and exotic papers. I embellish the pendants on whim and have received a lot of compliments on them. No two are exactly alike!"
5.0,I bought these pajamas for my mother. She has very bad arthritis in her hands and can‚Äôt do buttons. She loves them! And they are so soft!!!
5.0,"I bought an inexpensive hat for a party, but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the item.  I can use this one every day if I wished.  No problems."

5.0,Liverpool
5.0,Used as a Belle Halloween costume and this dress was perfect!
5.0,"So Comfortable! I love these shoes! Very cute! Lots of compliments when I wear them.  Size runs a tiny bit small so take that into consideration when ordering.<br />All in all, excellent buy.  Took a while to get, but I am pleased.  Look just like the picture, which is fantastic as, often times things don't."
5.0,I bought this hat for my 2 yr old. I was nervous not knowing what size to get since she has a large head for her age. The 3T fits great and I have faith it will last all summer. Her head measured at 20inches for those wondering.
5.0,"These masks are wonderful! The materialbos silky smooth and the elastic has generous stretch too. The material is thin and breathable whilst still providing ample protection. I like that they fit my kids perfectly and don't rub or irritate them. They're comfortable all day at school and help make the masks more usuable. All in all, I w ok old highly recommend these!"
5.0,This is a great sweatshirt and it's fits true to its size...but I read the other reviews and everyone is dying that it runs really small but in reality it doesn't so I got this in a large instead of extra large and I had to keep the sweatshirt (it was for my friend) and get him a different present. But if you like baggy sweatshirts or ones that aren't to tight I would suggest to get a size larger than you usually would:) So yeah hope this was helpful
5.0,Looks nice- similar to the photo. I bought it to dye with Rit Dye More dyes (for synthetics) and got the tips and bangs to a very pretty hot pink for Halloween.
5.0,"these socks are soft, well-fitting"
5.0,"Love Nike shoes, great color, fit as they should."

5.0,I love the dress I use the dress for a graduation party outside event
5.0,Fits great and great quality definitely satisfied. Good for back days
5.0,So pretty and unique. The heart shaped handle is a nice touch. a little pricey but its pretty so that makes up for it.
5.0,"Very nice feel and a cute look!<br />Wore with some khaki pants and jeans, worked with both."
5.0,"We are very happy with this purchase. And ya ya was very happy as well, it is amazing quality looks More like a 60$ bracelet for half the cost you can‚Äôt go wrong.  I would totally<br />Purchase again from this seller"
5.0,"Shiny, dainty, and well made"
5.0,The top fit slightly loose not to bad and the bottom was a little tight but could still move around and sit down
5.0,"I LOVE this top!!! The print is beautiful and the lace pocket is a great detail. And it's a relaxed fit, but still has some shape to it. I'm 5'7&#34; and 150lbs and a large fit great. I think a med would have fit as well, but I like the looser feel."
5.0,we love it and plan on buying more colors. Everyone wanted one!
5.0,These are most comfortable flip flops!
5.0,Nice design and texture.  the ratchet system is a real nice concept with great execution.
5.0,of course i will still wear sunscreen but i think this will help keep the sun off my face. it's woven like a basket so some sun will still be able to get through but it's a tight weave so it casts a nice shade on my face.
5.0,3 months after I've bought them they haven't fallen apart and still working as good as the first day.  Good buy
5.0,My nephew loved these.
5.0,"I love these sunglasses. In fact, this pair is my second purchase from losing the first out at the lake. They are sturdy yet pliable, you can bend the nose peice to fit better. With a good price, you should check'm out. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,"This was as expected, and a very well-made and cute little skirt."
5.0,"I love these harem pants! The pattern is wonderful & the rayon fabric is super soft & lightweight without being too transparent, plus, they have a soft & comfy, slightly gathered jersey knit waist band. They are beautiful & comfortable, dress them up or wear them casually!<br /><br />For fit reference, I'm a standard U.S. 5'6&#34;, 150 lb female, & I bought the size L, just in case they really shrank from washing, plus, I've been bed ridden lately, so I needed them to be slightly baggy & roomy, for comfort, not clingy. They fit me slightly more loosely than I expected so I may wash them in warm water to try to shrink them a bit more. They fit slightly more loosely than the ones on the model in the listing. I probably could have gone with one size down. The waist is very gently stretchy & comfy, not binding at all. The ankles are also gently elasticized, right now, since they are a bit too big, they fall over my heels, but, as I mentioned, I'll just try to shrink the pants a little bit in warm water ; )<br /><br />After I first received them, I gave them a quick seam check for any loose seams or flaws (they looked slightly larger at this point), then I hand washed them in cool water, with Woolite, thoroughly rinsed them in cool water & hung them up to air dry. The colors do run the first time they're washed & the fabric does shrink, but this fabric is expected to do that, so do be prepared & don't be surprised. After this first wash I launder them, inside a mesh lingerie bag, in the washing machine, using cold water, on the gentle cycle, then hang them to air dry & they come out just fine. The rayon fabric is moderately thin but not as thin as some other harem pants I have & they aren't really see-through when worn, so flesh toned under garments are just fine. The fabric is very smooth & wonderfully cool on hot days.<br /><br />So far, I haven't had any issues with any seams coming out or tearing or anything else. These look well made & are very elegant, easily dressed up or worn casually. Again, the fabric is slightly thicker than some of the other, almost handkerchief thin rayon some harem pants are made of (which I also own). I'd gladly buy from this company again : )"
5.0,"Quality is fantastic; color is beautiful and as is pictured. Fit is spot on.<br />Bought a second of the same parka, but in light grey!"
5.0,Very cute. I was looking for a mini backpack to carry all the essentials like gloves & masks around during the pandemic since my purse too small. This backpack is exactly what I wanted. Very roomy & fit my 32 oz HydroFlask perfectly as well.<br />I took off the pad in the front to make it look simpler. Also straps is adjustable to your height. Worth the price & I absolutely love it.
5.0,"Great gym, jogging, a.nd lounging."
5.0,They come in last night very beatiful thank you üòçüòç
5.0,Arrived in a timely manner! Excellent pairs of glasses! Made reading so much easier.

5.0,I LOVE IT and WOW Fast Service. THANKS!!!! Will be Ordering More...THANKS
5.0,Love these mask and were even used to travel with no problems
5.0,The fit is good and I love the color
5.0,"These are really nice tshirts. They fit well and the 3XL is true to size. I do notice that they are a lot longer than other shirts of the same size but that isnt really a bad thing, just different. The material is very soft and feels good going on, almost like your favorite vintage shirt thats been well used and well loved. So far the print has stayed on the shirt and it just feels very comfortable!<br />I am often on Amazon buying products and use reviews to help me decide which one may best suit my needs. I rely on others' reviews to guide me in finding out the good and bad about things I'm interested in and so this is why I often write reviews for everything I've tried so that it may help someone else and that is how I came to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for this honest review. This honest review is in no way influenced by the discount. The opinion and words are strictly my own that I've provided after testing this product to see if it would be a good fit for me and my family.<br /><br />If you have any questions about this product, please do not hesitate to ask me and I will try my best to help you figure out if this may be a good product for you."

The fit is A line and come to the mid-thigh.¬† Perfect with or without leggings underneath.¬† We love this brand and find that the clothes really hold up.¬† Check the size chart!¬† My daughters are petite but I find that they wear a size smaller in this brand than others.¬† I would definitely recommend and reorder this style.¬† I wish this style came in solid colors too.¬†
5.0,Really cute and a great value!

5.0,We sold these at a school fundraiser and they were very popular and looked beautiful. Fits younger and older girls. Nice to have 3 different light modes plus a few different colors and one multi-color style. Very satisfied customer and I should have purchased more.
5.0,"I love this ring. I wear it on my middle finger. I wanted to get a Celtic tattoo, but I'm a coward. This ring is a perfect substitute."
5.0,"This is another great item from Patti Boutik!  I'm 5'9"" 125 pounds and a size small fit perfectly.  This really shows off my curves!  I already had this style in the short-sleeved version in pink and really liked it, so was happy to find the long sleeve in beige.  It is perfect for fall and winter.  I would probably by another if it was available in a larger variety of colors."
5.0,"Bought for grandaughter residing in Wyoming. Before buying this item, my daughter sent picture of my grandaughter making snow angel and her hair and head was halfway out of her hood exposed. So I searched in Amazon if there's winter mask, hat and scarf and found this awesome set. My grandaughter loves it."
5.0,Love it! Perfect for her!
5.0,These were really nice. I bought them for a cowgirl costume but have enjoyed wearing them with other outfits. They are made well and a deal for the price.
5.0,"Very pretty, as shown..<br />Delivered on time, as promised.<br />Appreciated e-mails  keeping me updated<br />  on shipping & delivery."
5.0,"I LOVE THESE SO MUCH, WISH I COULD WEAR THIS BOOT, FITS NARROW FOR A B SIZE, NEED A WIDE WHICH THEY DO NOT MAKE.  BEAUTIFUL BOOT. LOVE IT, LOVE IT."
5.0,This dress is so versatile and can be dressed up or down! It‚Äôs super soft feel makes it a dream to wear and it fits great! I would definitely recommend this dress as a staple to anyone‚Äôs closet!
5.0,Didn't like the fact that the wristband were to short. I think this is more like a children's watch. Other then that I like the way it looks.
5.0,"If you're using a green laser level and are struggling to see the line/point, these are what you're looking for. I have a Milwaukee laser level and it is a good tool. My level works great indoors, however, I was struggling to see the lines 50' away outside in the summer sun. Pop on these glasses and it was much easier to pick up my lines to finish my work. Really, should be included with any decent level."
5.0,"They are just as described and pictured. I bought them for my 2 year old because she snatches earrings out all the time, but with these she can‚Äôt get them off and haven‚Äôt bothered them since."
5.0,I absolutely LOVE these.  I get compliments every time I wear them.
5.0,Looks exactly like the picture! Super sparkly and shiny! Definitely worth the money! Would recommend to anyone!
5.0,they are what the are
5.0,Bbhh
5.0,I love the Olivia and Joy totes.  I am constantly getting compliments on them.  I want to add more colors to my collection.
5.0,This backpack is holding up much better than anything else I've bought in the price range. My son loves it and it hasn't fallen apart like most of the other $20 chinese backpacks have. What more could you ask for?
5.0,When you buy a teenage grandaughter a dress for a special occassion you can only hope she would be please.  To my surprise she LOVED it.
5.0,Llaman la atencion
5.0,I had ordered other team flags that are thin and wimpy. This flag is high quality with thick material. The logo stands out and you can tell it's well made.
5.0,"They fit great, stay in place, and work perfectly for holding my phone while walking and biking! I like them so much I've got multiple pairs and just had to size down!"
5.0,This was a hit!!
5.0,Beautiful. Large sparkly love them
5.0,pretty dope glasses. fit a lil snug around the head but. still saucy
5.0,"Okay, so this robe is like wearing a microfiber blanket, almost literally.  It feels very lightweight on the body but it is certainly not thin.  I've got this microfiber blanket on my bed and this robe totally feels like the same material.  It feels almost like a blanket manufacturer stitched their blanket material into the form of a robe.  It is light to the touch, lightweight, and so soft!  Its lightness and softness makes it almost feel like it's not there, like you don't have anything on your body,  just because it is so comfy!  I love this robe!!  I recommend it to everyone!  And it is already getting warm in southern California, like high 80s, and so far the robe has still been comfortable in the morning, not too warm."
5.0,Bought this for my son as part of a costume about being responsible and being a good boss of yourself. He loved it and it suited his purpose well. It did break shortly after but it had served its purpose.
5.0,Keychain was a gift to my fianc√©. It‚Äôs high quality and the message is clearly written. It‚Äôs charming and meaningful. An awesome reminder to drive safely because someone who loves you is home waiting. Gift recipient was touched by the sentiment.
5.0,Absolutely LOVE this top!!!  I got a medium and it fits perfect. I did listen to other reviews and bought a size down. Looks and fits just like it is shown.
5.0,Granddaughters love the style and feel.
5.0,Bought these for my wife and she loves the fact that there's so many of them. She is going to love being able to swap them out and to be able to have different colors.
5.0,They have the best hats and coolest designs. They‚Äôre comfortable and always get me compliments.
5.0,Great fit plus not to hot to use everyday use. Fits true to size.
5.0,Plenty of arch support and spongy sole but seem to run about 1/2 size too big.
5.0,"True to size. Easy to wash. The only problem is that it does get fuzzy, but it's not a huge deal and easy to fix. Love it!"
5.0,I own a small farm in Upstate NY and it gets cold in the dead of weather. This shirt is lightweight and keeps me warm. Would buy it again.
5.0,"My wife loves these! Fits great, soft warm and comfortable."
5.0,I‚Äôm a jewelry snob. I own very little costume jewelry...yet I love this and am happy and proud to wear it. Looks as real as it possibly can. Great craftsmanship and value. Comfortable to wear.<br />Quality of the metal and finish is the best you can get in costume jewelry
5.0,High quality and cute package. They were a smaller diameter than I thought but look great anyway
5.0,Love love<br />Great price<br />Great length<br />Have gotten compliments<br />Happy
5.0,These fit beautifully and do not slip off my feet like other pairs I have had. The lace shows around the edges of my shoes and looks lovely. I will purchase again.
5.0,He loved it!  He watched the movie 3 times!
5.0,Love it... just a perfect size for a mom of two
5.0,PERFECT FOR CHRISTMAS. I LOVE GNOMES AND CHRISTMAS. THANK YOU.
5.0,I‚Äôve had this for a very long time actually & I love it. Very durable and I love that really strong clasp. And it‚Äôs so easy to slip on my wrist but it doesn‚Äôt easily slip off. And it‚Äôs big so it always stands out to help me find my keys. May reorder a different color as it will get dull over time
5.0,These were sent as a gift to an octogenarian who doesn't want to mess up her hair with a hat.  They are perfect!
5.0,Beautifully made great product.
5.0,Great mask!
5.0,"Perfect fit, quality is excellent for the price- been washed and worn a ton and no fading or loose threads or anything you‚Äôd expect with ‚Äúcheap‚Äù clothing. Happy with the purchase."
5.0,Very sparkly and the stones don‚Äôt fall out
5.0,"This is my second set of these. They are very well made and have a soft terry lining across the inside of the forehead. They have a nice cinch cord, and fit my medium length hair really well. The more you wash them, the softer they get.  The coolest part is that they are indeed retired Vera Bradley prints- I know the company cannot advertise them as such, but the one with the black background is ""Symphony in Hue"" and matches exactly to a bag I have that I use for work. The one with the colored circles is ""Impressionista"". I don't know the others."
5.0,great earrings for the price and look way more expensive than they are.
5.0,I bought this for my wife.  This is a cute item and much easier to wear than a N95 mask.  A+
5.0,"SHhhhhHHHheeeee LOVES HER QUEEN POPPyKicks! Good deal, good quality, All around very good purchase that arrived within a few days, thanky Ju!"
5.0,"My daughter loves these shirts! She would wear them everyday if I would let her. They are a little bit on the small side though, she usually wears a 4T and I sized up and bought a 5T. It‚Äôs a little hard to get over her head but otherwise it fits great!"
5.0,"Got the package quickly. It comes with two, just FYI. The item itself is great, I leave it in, and no issues have come up."
5.0,"I love this earring!! It fits my ear great, no trouble, unless you move your head too much then of course it'll fall off. As pictured, it's for your left ear ear only. It was delivered fast, just in time for Halloween, and came in a plastic bag."
5.0,"A lot of the reviews said this dress was too small. Also looking at the measurements, it seemed like I should go up a size. I looked at some pics and decided to go with my normal size (small) instead of going up a size as suggested by many. The dress was actually a bit big on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, 120lbs, and my measurements are roughly 32, 26.5, 37.5. I definitely had room to spare in the small.<br />Aside from that, it‚Äôs a great little outfit. I got lots of compliments. I was very happy with it!"
5.0,This was the sweetest tux for my little boy. Great quality and great for. I was so worried about purchasing online as it was close to the wedding date but it was absolutely perfect.
5.0,"It took me forever to find a case like this and it‚Äôs beautiful, sleek and durable! Love it!"
5.0,"Love these bras! My only suggestion is to go a size up. I‚Äôm normally a Large & 36D, but ordered XL based on other reviews & they fit perfectly!"
5.0,"I did not expect the rings to be so big but I still love it nevertheless. I was scared also the choker would not fit me, but it is very adjustable. I am very happy with my purchase of my first choker."
5.0,Fit great and very cute!
5.0,Gorgeous necklace!  I received many compliments! Good quality too!
5.0,Fits well and effectively blocks the sun-highly recommended.
5.0,"Great dress, has the same quality that I've come to expect from my past Miusol purchases. Material is stretchy and sturdy - not thin or see-through at all, so just perfect.<br /><br />If you've purchased a Miusol dress before, the sizing for this one seems to run identically to most of their other dresses (at least the ones I've worn). So for me, the fit was exactly as expected. Keep in mind that if you are buying the &#34;right&#34;/&#34;intended&#34; size, the dress will fit you closely like it does on the model in the picture. This is of course subject to your own body shape as well - I am more pear-shaped than the model so I found that the waist fit me more snugly than in the picture (but, since the material is stretchy, it caused no issue at all).<br /><br />For reference I usually wear a Levi's jean size of 12 and a women's Fitted T-Shirt size of XL. I found that the Miusol XL provided the closest fit to what is pictured."
5.0,"These are awesome, but make sure to purchase 2."
5.0,This is a very good buy I highly recommend it
5.0,"I absolutely love this bracelet! It is durable and from that i can see, is quality crafted.<br />The engraving is straight and there are no flaws on the front metal plate.<br />I definitely recommend this product!"
5.0,Grand boy loved them for Christmas!
5.0,Beautiful! Very nice quality! Fancy I'd dare to say!!
5.0,It arrived quick. Love the feel of the beads .  Just beautiful! Very satisfied
5.0,Nice assortment. Well Made. Would recommend.
5.0,I actually prefer these to the official ones. It's held up great for three months and I swap my bands daily.
5.0,"If I knew that the orthotic inserts would feel like this, I would  buy them much earlier than I did.  I had problem feet for the longest time, because there is flat feet, when i walk for a long time, the ache killed my feet due the arch of shoe insoles i bought before was not high enough, but when i put these in my shoes, i feel pain relief, which is something i really like."
5.0,"I work at home and can wear these all day. Comfortable, and good looking if I have to go out to run errands."
5.0,Comfortable leather Reefs with the bottle opener perfect for college and beach days
5.0,"Adorable. I was worried about quality, considering the price. The dress isn't the best or most expensive material I've owned, but it is a super cute dress. There wasn't anything wrong or odd about the one I received. I received a ton of compliments on the dress. I'd recommend this purchase. I'm a size 4 and I purchased the small. The material is stretchy."
5.0,"I was hesitant to purchase; however, I am so glad I did. This dress was/is beautiful, fits extremely well and comfortable. The only drawback is that is extremely long. I am 5'5 1/2 and I wore 3 1/2 inch heels and it was still long but I didn't care. So many compliments and I danced all night. I purchased a Large and it is true to size."
5.0,We‚Äôll made and very cute!
5.0,Great product!! I bought 2<br />Black and silver- love them!!
5.0,Really cute and well made!
5.0,cute! sheer but perfect for hot days!
5.0,"This is such a fun funky necklace. It is sure to be noticed and people will be asking what it is if they don't know and aren't familiar with chemical compounds. Then once you tell them what it is they are going to love it. It's a perfect gift for any coffee/tea/energy drink or caffeine lover in your life! I am obsessed with caffeine and coffee. It has gotten me through more days than i can count. I would be LOST without it! lol Point is- i am passionate about it! This necklace is a conversation starter too. People will want to know what it is. It it such a clever fun idea and not your regular run of the mill piece of jewelry.<br /><br />It comes on an 18 inch chain with a 3 inch extender on it. I LOVE that it lets me have that extra three inches so i can wear it higher or lower on my neck depending on what i'm wearing. The chain links are on the bigger side. The silver finish is NOT dull like an antique finish. It is a shiny silver and made well. I don't feel like the chain is so flimsy that it will break and the caffeine charm itself is good quality. It doesn't look cheap at all and the structure of the molecules are accurate. It isn't too big or overpowering hanging on your neck. I feel like the charm is the perfect size, not too big or too small. The actual charm is approx. 1 1/2 inches wide and 1 1/4 inches tall.<br /><br /> I LOVED taking chemistry in college and this reminds me of those days. I love the more (i hate to say it bc its such a cliche term now) nerdy, science-y accessories that are popular now. Girls don't have to be GIRLY all the time..they can love science and show it. This accessory is a perfect way to express yourself in a fun different way and to personalize your accessories to match up with what you love in life. And trust me, coffee is something i love dearly! I also LOVE the other molecule necklaces available too. I can see myself wanting to get the seretonin or dopamine ones as well because i definitely have days when i'm not feeling as happy as i could. It's cute to think that even though i may be feeling sad, that i can WEAR the chemicals that make me happy. And also with this caffeine necklace. It's a way for me to always have some even if i don't have a cup of coffee in my hand. So since i am so happy with this one i just know the other two i saw by this seller will be gotten soon too.<br /><br />Overall, i am completely satisfied with this purchase. It was all i expected and more. Everyone that has seen it LOVES it so i know what gifts to get them when any holidays come around. It came in a felt gift bag that i can use for travel to avoid it getting scratched up, OR if you are giving it as a gift it is basically wrapped already! I love that i am supporting a small business. The seller was sure to email me and make sure that i was happy with everything. They truly care about their products and their customers satisfaction. Their necklace is great quality and doesn't turn my skin green. It was a great purchase and i can't wait to complete my collection with the other ones i saw too! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. These opinions are my own and i was not swayed in any way. I really am happy with this necklace and can't wait to get more. It's an original funny clever idea that just expresses who i am and what i love without saying a word."
5.0,"Nice sweatshirt, just fits a bit small."
5.0,Fits as expected. Makes your waist look small.
5.0,It‚Äôs nice and stretchy and very comfortable. Surprised at the quality for the price!  I‚Äôm petite so I‚Äôll cut off some of the strands on the bottom. Fun costume!
5.0,"This scarf is short enough to use for a hair tie-up (which I originally wanted it for), as well as a nice neck scarf.  Glad I got this ...!"
5.0,"Since I'm in America for a while I had to buy some gloves.<br />I must say, I did nothing wrong with this choice. The gloves have a nice stiffness and are protecting well. I use them for Thai box training and even blocking kicks with them, brings still a nice protection.<br />I will use them now for a while and update my review."
5.0,"Simple but effective, well made and sturdy, gives me a feeling of confidence when carrying around my new camera. It performs exactly as advertised."
5.0,They fit great.  They are extremely comfortable and the material doesn‚Äôt feel cheap.  I would buy them again.  I wish they had different designs and I would purchase more.
5.0,"fits great, don't dry them they will shrink. If you can hang to dry these socks are great for everyday wear!"
5.0,Pretty and encouraging!
5.0,Looks even better in person! My daughter loves it!
5.0,Hat  fits  great
5.0,My sister and I have cataracts  and we love them!
5.0,Super cute on ! Fit as expected. Blouse might have been a little small but overall worth the money.
5.0,It's beautiful. Has a pretty chain.
5.0,Just what I wanted. Gives my LBD ( little black dress) a new polished look
5.0,"I was skeptical, but these cheap glasses do actually block blue light from monitors, and it helps the experience of working on the computer so much better for those of us who sit in front of a screen all day. The glasses are plastic, super lightweight, and are big! I think they are made to fit over top of regular glasses, but these also work for those of us with big heads. Anyway, I recommend these."
5.0,Very affordable and comfortable! Great for running as expected. Initially I was worried about hiking in Hawaii with these because some of the trails were slippery when wet and very steep. However I went several times and found the shoes to be very comfortable with decent traction and they dried very quickly. I'm quite happy with them!
5.0,"It was exactly as I had imagined. Came in the mail right on time. If you are unsure about the length always order a little bit bigger, it's super easy to adjust the size."
5.0,These are super soft and cozy socks. Colors are bright and cute. High quality material.
5.0,Scratch easy but at price just get another

5.0,Fits great for the size I got which was a 5T.
5.0,These are extremely comfortable and the fabric feels great. Would definitely buy again! Bought XL and it fits really nicely and looks great even with me being on the bigger side.
5.0,"There is nothing bad about these shorts. Love the length and color. They also have some stretch, but not to much. Had them on for at least 8 hours without them feeling like they are hanging in the seat."
5.0,"Nice product worth for the money I spent ! Last year I got a more expensive one, unfortunatlly, that one and had nothing but noise and did not work this year. It cleaned my pool in a matter of a couple of hours! So this year I just want to buy a cheap one for using once. Luckly, it moves very well and quicky clean my pool. And this one is much easier to attach to my pool. I am so glad with it! The only one that might be a dissapointed thing to me is it has a little bit noise, but much better than last one."
5.0,The cup seems durable and strong but also flexible. According to my 7 year old it is comfortable enough to not be a distraction or a bother when wearing it.
5.0,Very comfortable! Cute and good quality
5.0,So cute and soft!
5.0,Soft and just the right amount of thickness. Not too tight.
5.0,I was very pleasantly surprised with these masks.  They fit nicely and are well made.  The fabric patterns are cheery and the toggles on the ear straps allow for a custom fit.

5.0,Love it!! Stretch is perfect.
5.0,Great gift for any type of event
5.0,"It is oversized, so size down if that's not what you want. I love it! Perfect to throw on after shower and lounge it. I went back and ordered another one. It would be nice if it came in other colors. Buy it. You wont regret."
5.0,"Nice looking, works well, decent price"
5.0,"Great price, and a heavy duty pair of socks. Very well padded sock, and very comfortable."
5.0,"These are great. Not too big and baggy like most boxers but not too tight at the same time. Perfect for summer time, nice and cool. I'd ordered these online because the store where I'd purchased my first pack from never has my size in stock, 32 - 34."
5.0,Purchased this as a gift for my Mother who walks with a cane and wanted a wrist purse. She loved it.
5.0,"Wife loves them, no more cut fingers."
5.0,Loved this necklace. It was exactly what I ordered!

5.0,These earrings are so cute.  Even my 14-year-old daughter loved them.  I get compliments all the time.  The flower is a foamy material which makes them light and easy to wear.
5.0,"Read the reviews previous to purchase skeptical if this was really an authentic Gucci belt, but it is the real deal! Well made. Looks better than the photo. I measured where my jeans sit not my true waist line. Fits perfectly. Highly recommend. Wish it came in brown as well."
5.0,"Genuine, US made, Polartec."
5.0,Definitely one of the superior quality CZ solitaires out there.<br /><br />Very happy with it.

5.0,I love it so much it makes me want to spend time in exile on a deserted earth-like planet that looks like Skellig-Michael.
5.0,Very pleased with the workmanship. Will wear with pride.
5.0,"This ring is beautiful and perfect and exactly what I wanted.  I got it for my pointer finger and it will definitely be an every day ring. It's nice and light and makes a statement without being too bold. Also, it does have a metal stamp so it is definitely real 925 silver."
5.0,Well made and very comfortable.  This is a casual fit which I love.  It washes well and wears well.  A really comfortable long sleeve shirt.  Great for around the house or to wear to a casual gathering.  Highly recommended.  I love the buttons as well.
5.0,Perfect size. Looks just like advertised.
5.0,"Worked perfect for my Garth Algar costume, would be a really nice gift for your flannel wearing folks in your life. True to size."

5.0,I had this too in an xl.  I lost weight and so I ordered a small and was so happy Amazon still carried this tshirt.  I looked everywhere for a ringer style tshirt and this one is great.  It fits my shoulders really well and I feel great wearing it.
5.0,Very cute I like it
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:a754a899351d05beefd6fabea6d0c033]] Don't mind the slippers or dirty mirror, this dress is well made and beautiful. Honestly,  I knew when I got it that it wouldn't fit me the length of the model and I was right. It firts more towards the middle of my shins. For reference, I am 5'1"" and around 90lbs, I got a size small.<br />  I didn't mind because originally I was going to shorten The hem but after trying it on, I'm not sure I want to anymore! It gives me witchy vibes and putting it on, it looks more edwardian. I love it! It fit perfectly fine everywhere else which I'm glad!"
5.0,Will work great.
5.0,These shoes are super cute!  The pic does not do it justice. My daughter squealed when I pulled them out of the box because the silver is all sparkly like glitter.  REALLY girly and cute.  I love Sketchers and my daughter loves wearing them.  :-)
5.0,"Was not expecting the hoodie to feel this soft, very comfy, but fits very snug, no wiggle room at all. This is the size I usually wear without the snug fit."
5.0,"Yay, better at sopping up the humid Georgia summer hot flashes and the thin things that usually pass as sweat bands. Makes me much more comfortable. They fit comfortably, too."
5.0,Super cute and simple. I'm a US size 4/6 with a small C cup bra. The small fit perfectly.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:c8a332bcf222a68c57cfef96cb4da151]] Pair it with a nice leather skirt and it‚Äôs the perfect look!!
5.0,This hoodie is so cute! I love it. I purchased the grey one and I wear it often.
5.0,"I have previously loved my puma ankle socks in the past whichs have lasted several years and worn very well, so I went ahead and ordered a package of these puma brand crew socks.  They arrived and are of the same high quality, super soft, well constructed and a great amount of stretch to stay up but not constrictive and leave those nasty too-tight lines on my ankles I have gotten from cheaper socks. They wash well and hold there size and shape. These are definitely worth the slightly higher price and I would recommend them to anyone looking for an everyday or athletic sock.  I will be ordering another package in black.  This item fits me great and I wear a women's shoe size 11."
5.0,"has a lil swivel thing at the top so you can screw forever without letting up, 10/10"
5.0,1st off this is sooo pretty. 2nd I am a sucker for presentation and this one passes with a beautiful Tiffany blue box. 3rd you can adjust the chain which is a plus. 4th I don't really like matchy matchy sets but this looks so cute together I had to make an exception. I would recommend this as a gift for yourself or someone special.
5.0,"great wallet and it is of high quality leather and very durable, should last many years, thank you"
5.0,Soft on my feet.  I have neuropathy in my feet and every little thing hurts them. These socks are soothing and comfortable when nothing else is.
5.0,"I got my first pair of Judy Blues last year and while I love them, they are very long. I'm only 5'4 so I really wanted a paid that fit my height better. These ones are perfect! I ordered a 9/29 and they fit as expected. Super comfortable, good color and great length. Highly recommend if you haven't tried this brand."
5.0,"Great fit, super soft material"
5.0,Love these glasses. They have helped my eyes so much. I work At computer all day and these glasses have helped with the glare!! They are also very stylish and comfortable.
5.0,"Super great quality, and so soft!"
5.0,"I love the velcro straps on the shoulders and around the ribcage.  Haven't worked out or ran in it yet but i did a few jumping jacks really quick and this bra did not disappoint.  I wear a 40D and ordered a 40D and its perfact.  I'm 5'5"" and weigh 192lbs.  I will be buying more!!"
5.0,The color scheme was bright and cheerful; the accordion wallet was perfect and fits a lot of cards! Zippered wallet is great so items don't fall out and there's even a place inside (zippered) for coins!!!  Great quality product which I look forward to enjoying for many years!
5.0,Gift to grandkids
5.0,"Love my new ice cream PJs. They're so soft and comfortable.  I'm fat and they fit my form. If you don't like that, not for you. I bought the largest size and I'm 250 lbs, 5'4&#34;. Happy happy."

5.0,I'm a guy who wore this as a Halloween costume and let me say that &#34;male freedom&#34; you receive from this dress was amazing! A few drinks into the night and it didn't bother me one bit that I was high stepping through the night in this amazing dress. I owned that dress and it owned me. We were a team. It made me look fabulous.
5.0,This necklace is super cute.
5.0,"This is the perfect crinoline petticoat for under swing skirts and dresses!

5.0,"Great flip flops. Super cute. I bought for my niece for her Easter gift.  She loved them, being the girlie girl she is! The price from Amazon was considerably cheaper than anywhere I could find locally.  The fit a little smaller than expected, so it might be advised to order up a half size or so.

5.0,i loved this very much. We had a Disney themed picnic at my work and this was just right touch. Very good quality and it helped that it was adjustable. Could be worn by an adult or child.
5.0,"I love this design with the flowers and Lines. I bought this one to match a outfit. But‚Ä¶it arrived a different shade/color. The photos on-line show it in a lavender shade but what arrived was not lavender it was Pink. I choose not to return the scarf, it is nice pretty. I like the Design so much I can wear it with something else. Just not the outfit I intended. Just thought I‚Äôd mention it as it might effect someone else‚Äôs decision."
5.0,I love these shirts!!  They are long enough to be worn with leggings.  They wash up very nicely... minimal shrinkage.  I always get compliments when I wear them!  I have several!

5.0,I totally love this hat and I hate beanies!!
5.0,"These are really nice quality and 1/3 the price in the exact same style from a designer brand I like. If you want the fit to be a little looser, size up. I ordered 3 sizes to figure out which one was right for me. I'm a 39"" chest and the size 2xl was the right fit for me as a tank top to wear at the gym. If I wanted it as a super tight undershirt, I would have taken the XL. Hope that helps."
5.0,Beautiful pair and at a great price.

5.0,Love this top. Bought all three colors. Wanted something I could nurse in but still looked flattering (most nursing tops are pretty much moo-moos). This worked perfectly! I wear them constantly and they've worn very well through frequent washings for such an inexpensive top.

5.0,Awesome! Heavy buckle though.
5.0,Looks awesome on my Galaxy Watch.
5.0,great for everyday use goes with any jeans or pants
5.0,Beautiful necklace for my 4 year old to wear with an ivory lace dress.  The flowers soft and pearls are a good size. Seems durable too.
5.0,"very good quality and it‚Äôs all as described, at first it seems it‚Äôs wet but all leathers come like that, also very important to measure your head as the picture they provide and choose the correct size. I had to contact customer service and they were awesome and quickly responded. If you are a first time leather product buyer, I would recommend this for starters."
5.0,"These are really pretty plugs and the size is dead on. I used my calipers to measure them because I was concerned the company might have measured the smaller base not the top where the glass slumps (yes that's the technical term) given the previous not so great review, but they measured correctly. Unfortunately I'm back up to 14mm so I wasn't able to wear them, but I did buy a 14mm pair. I'm just waiting for them to arrive from Taiwan."
5.0,Perfect!. I love it
5.0,"This bag is still holding up well after months of using it. I can store lots of stuff in it. Journals, books, even my makeup bag. It's perfect for everyday use."
5.0,"They are super awesome as undershirts when at work in a healthcare setting. They're very effective at moisture-wicking and the material is comfy. They did smell a bit when they arrived, but a run through the washing machine fixed that. If you order your usual size, they will be VERY FORM FITTING and you can see every lump, bump, crease, and roll, so keep that in mind if you're a woman of size or are otherwise not super comfortable with your body. But as an undershirt, they work great! I wouldn't wear one on its own without spanx or very high-waisted pants."
5.0,"These worked out well for me and my husband, I have used them as a headband and light-weight face-mask. My husband uses them as a face mask while cutting brush, woodworking, and while out and about. They are long enough and snug enough to  stay in place and provide adequate coverage. Would be better with a pocket for a filter, but for a one-layer mask, these are great!"
5.0,Works awesome!  Really cool side pockets!
5.0,Love my pin
5.0,THE DIFFERENT COLOR OPTION FOR HOW YOUR DRESSED FOR THE DAY.
5.0,Me<br /><br />Small fits as medium. Company must create x small sizes.
5.0,"I love the thickness of these tank tops.  They keep snug throughout the day.  I‚Äôve ordered Papi tanks that loosen up in half hour.  Pure junk.  G Unit tops are what I usually use every day.  Wish their price was lower, but will continue to get these."
5.0,"excellent, soft and comfortable to carry, lot of space‚ò∫"
5.0,I wore it on Christmas day.  Love this style of necklace.
5.0,Great Cub cover!
5.0,It hasn't turned color yet üëèüëè
5.0,"Not too big, not too little. Definitely get the job done. May not want to use the grips to keep them locked (maybe use a rubber band or something like that) or else they may cause bruising but they're definitely worth the price."
5.0,"Super cute shoes!  Sizing a but weird too determine, but we managed.  A but bug, but perfect for an 11 year old to grow into (instead of out of!) We'll be buying more!"
5.0,"I bought my first Susu bag and was really impressed with the quality of this leather product.  Most of my other leather bag purchases resulted in returns because the leather was either too hard or the handbag handles were digging into my shoulder.  All my Susu bags are beautiful and practical, not to mention the great price Amazon offers. A must have bag for practical women."
5.0,"tiene un acabado muy bonito, excelente!"
5.0,Great product. Cute. Different variety for every mood I have. The metal doesn't react. Easy to change.
5.0,I love these shorts. They are soft and they fit perfectly and I have had so many compliments on them. I will be buying more ASAP! I love the pockets also and the length!!!
5.0,wife bought this...great top! great length. was just a tad big in the armpit but not enough for me to exchange it for a medium. i am typically a 12 in tops and busty and it washes and dries with no shrinkage or piling
5.0,"Beautifully made, comfortable, and has a flattering shape! Absolutely darling designs available- I got the unicorns as a fun little splurge and now that I have it in my hands, really wish I‚Äôd have ordered more! Working on a COVID floor has dimmed a lot right now, but these fun designs give my day a little pick-me-up. Thank you!"
5.0,I love it and my son today came over and helped me put it on.  Thank you so much for such an interesting necklace.<br /><br />Mitzi
5.0,Just extra large enough.  Very comfy and durable cloth.
5.0,"I needed a clear set of glasses to put prism stickers on (for double vision).  I didn't want to buy expensive frames from the optician because all I need was a clear set of glasses and they affix a clear sticker to correct my double vision.  Because the price was so low on these glasses, I thought they might look cheesy.  But they have a great designer look, fit perfectly on my face, and it looks like I have $500 frames.  I highly recommend these!"
5.0,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who attends gymnastics year round.  It fits as expected and is a nice soft material.  Capezio is a reliable brand and I have washed it several times without any issues.  I expect it to hold up over time without any issues.
5.0,Super happy with these biker shorts! The fit is great and the fabric is buttery soft and comfortable. They hold you in without sliding down. The pocket is the perfect size for a phone. Definitely would recommend grabbing these for summer!
5.0,I love these. So comfortable!
5.0,Love the colors and easy to carry. Well made
5.0,Too small can't use it but it looks great I'll pass it to my nephew
5.0,"I bought these sunglasses mainly for mountain biking since they included the strap, but I gotta say, that you dont even have to use that strap, because the sunglasses are literally glued on your face once you put them on.  The quality is superb, after all its made in Germany, so the quality speaks for itself. The blue lenses look pretty cool and they dont fog up or sweat gets in them. I'm absolutely satisfied and will be ordering another pair just in case, for this price, I dont have to worry about breaking them."
5.0,"I am fan of Prime Labs products, especially Prime Test, but decided to try Prime Labs Test Boost. I am pleased that the Test Boost product works great. My work outs are more energetic with no jitters or crashes. I highly recommend this product for anyone as I am looking forward to completing this bottle."
5.0,Comfortable and fit fine
5.0,really cool.
5.0,This is exactly as expected. It is the same as the one Scottish Rite Hospital gave us.
5.0,My Grand daughter absolutely loved them!  She thought they were great!  Kid tested and kid approved 100%.
5.0,Work great. Wash great. Will probably order more!
5.0,"During the pandemic, wearing glasses & properly wearing a mask can be difficult because your glasses tend to fog up making it impossible to see!!<br />You easily spray your glasses, let it sit for 20 seconds & simply clean your glasses with the provided cloth."
5.0,"Love everything about these!  Fit, quality and cut are all great.  Product is true to size"
5.0,Delighted with this very inexpensive earrings
5.0,simply amazing
5.0,Fits perfectly to size. I love this dress I could wear every day. I will be ordering it in more colors
5.0,"I bought this shirt because I wanted something longer to cover my behind, I also have been wanting more white shirts! This long sleeve shirt fits me exactly right. It also has a nice vneck. And it is thick enough that you can not see through it."
5.0,very sturdy and pretty
5.0,Great print and amazing quality. This camo barber Cape will last a very long time. Exactly what professional barbers would use. The best part is the adjustable collar. Now I won‚Äôt get any more hair on me when my wife cuts my wig. Love it!! MERICA.
5.0,This is adorable!! I wore this with my ears to work!! The boys definitely got a kick out of it!!!ü§£
5.0,"For the money, you won't find a thicker belt. So thick and rigid in fact that you can't tie it. It takes a little work to make it more pliable but there's no doubt this is a quality belt."
5.0,These were very nice. I only returned because they were bigger than I expected.
5.0,My daughter loves these so much that we bought another pair!  So cute and lightweight!
5.0,"Not heavy. Opens easily, but doesn't open by mistake resulting in a panic because of lost keys (Happened with another key holder)."
5.0,Love to wear these playing poker
5.0,Very comfortable dress. I receive many compliments when I wear it. I highly recommend it.
5.0,Beautiful earrings; nice size.  Love them.
5.0,Really cute. The colors are pretty and it fits nicely.
5.0,"Just what I expected. üòè<br /><br />If you want a lightweight summer cover-up this is a perfect choice.<br />I'm 5'5'', 170#'s, average build. It covers my shoulders well with the points of the poncho style sweater dipping below my waist.<br />Have had this type of material before in shrugs and delicate cardigans.  Be aware it can snag easily and if it snags badly a hole may be created. Repairable maybe but because of the mono color, the mend would be obvious.<br />A nice alternative to a cardigan. Easily adjusted to whatever look/ preference you wish to create."
5.0,Very beautiful! more than on the picture.
5.0,"i've recently ordered a bunch of similar summer tops on amazon (because i don't enjoy going shopping), and of all of them, only this one is perfect.  gracefully disguises my belly but still has a waist, and shape to it... not easy to find.  i came back here hoping to buy one more in another color but none left, bummer."
5.0,Perfect dress for my daughter. Very comfy. She is 5‚Äô2 and 130 lbs. I bought the medium and it fit perfectly.
5.0,Es un mono lindo. Queda un poco justo
5.0,They work for brining handbells
5.0,They‚Äôre so cute and fit great!
5.0,"I have tiny fingers, so I wish they sold smaller than size 5, but this set has worked well enough for me. I ordered it to wear while I am getting my wedding and engagement rings sized and I do believe it is true to the named size. My thoughts on this set are that it is very pretty for the price. It probably won't be mistaken for diamonds by anyone, but they do sparkle very nicely in the light. Considering the price, they are nice rings. I have been wearing the set for several days without any problems, and will definitely keep it as a backup ring set once my others come back from the jewelry store. I did receive these cubic zirconia rings at a discount in exchange for an honest, unpaid review and will update if my experience with them changes over time."
5.0,So glad I ordered this. Very helpful after shoulder surgery.
5.0,"Fit great, soft and light weight"
5.0,"This raincoat is adorable, fits great, and is a great price."
5.0,It was just as it looked in pictures
5.0,"This is not a complete review but it was the only way I could upload a photo.  An earlier poster wanted to know what the dial looked like when the light was activated in a dark room.  When there is little ambient light the illumination from the watch LED is good enough display the day/date window very clearly as well as the numerals on the dial.  I also use it as a mini ""flashlight"" when I have to visit the other room in the middle of the night.<br /><br />One advantage of this model is the numerals in the LCD window are positive.  That is, the numbers and letters are black on a white background.  I feel this makes it easier to read than if it was the reverse.  All in all I am very happy with the watch.  I love the solar recharging feature - got tired of changing batteries in old watches - and the charge is always on H.  I always forget how to use the proper feature to reset the watch during daylight savings time which messes it up (operator error) but this is a minor issue.<br /><br />I did consider getting the version with atomic time to avoid DST issues but felt the feature was not worth spending another couple of hundred dollars; so far no regrets about my purchase."
5.0,Best watch ever.
5.0,"These are adorable, great quality, and at a great price! The ball on top snaps on and off so you can wash the hat!"
5.0,"Fits well, true to size. Nice length. Sleeves are a cute detail. Fabric is soft."
5.0,Love them! Beautiful earrings... perfect!
5.0,"So cute and well constructed! There are little bird-shaped beads on the end of the front tie that are fun. One thing to note, there is no give/stretch on the fabric and it did run a tad smaller than I'd like - will have to wear a sports bra for a better chest fit. The material is vibrant and does not smell of heavy chemicals."
5.0,I really like this simple tool to replace laces on boat shoes!  Easy to use.
5.0,I absolutely love this watch.  The colors are amazing.  This is my first turtle and I&#34;m looking to buy more.  Watch is about 15 secs. slow per day for me.  Hopefully it will settle in as I wear it more.
5.0,"I bought the red version of these for my husband for Christmas. WOW! It hugged his... body ... so nicely and showed off all that he has, but to him it didn't feel tight at all. He claimed it was very smooth and comfortable, even with its second-skin fit. It looked and felt fabulous! I ordered him two more -- including this black one -- for his birthday. Ladies, definitely a must-have for your man."
5.0,I bought these to use as slippers. They are soft and warm and perfect for my intentions. They are a bit big and I haven't tested out the waterproof claim but for the price why not give them a shot.
5.0,Got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. The color is very vibrant and beautiful
5.0,"Very pretty, and they look expensive."
5.0,Helps me to have lest pain in my right foot
5.0,Bought for hiking/camping. They so far have served their purpose. You can pull pants legs up to height you want and secure with drawstring.
5.0,"Great wallet! Zipper works smoothly, very nice packaging! Great for a gift!"
5.0,Love this hat.
5.0,watch works great very happy with this item
5.0,"I received a promotional discount for an unbiased and honest review of the product. I love this dress! I'm not a dress person but I needed something for an event for work. This was perfect. It isn't too formal but not too informal. It fit right in with a business casual environment. The skirt is nice and airy/swing-ish, and it comes with a belt around the waist to make it a bit adjustable. I would have liked the fabric to be a little less stiff but it works."
5.0,I absolutely love it
5.0,Loves the color
5.0,"I love this ring! Very comfortable on your finger unlike most rings of this type. Usually bulky rings feel bulky and get in the way and I end up taking them off soon after putting them on, but I can't even feel this one on my finger. Very nice, thank you."
5.0,A beautiful timepiece.
5.0,"Like very much, gave out as a gift, then I had to get set for myself."
5.0,I.love these. Ordered several. Super good qaulity
5.0,I just received it today and I love it! Even my husband wanted to have one ‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüíô
5.0,"I'm kind of upset that I unnecessarily sized up for this dress. I could have chosen my normal size and had a really cute dress. The bodice is stretchy and will fit most cup sizes. The rest of the fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. The dress is unlined but not sheer. The shoulders are adjustable in the back. There's about two inches of leeway. This is the perfect dress for warm weather. I highly recommend it. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The medium would have probably been the best fit.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
5.0,Nice Hat Good Quality
5.0,"This set is the perfect combination of style and function for any woman. The color is great and goes well with her ski pants. The knit exterior gives it a cute, cozy look, while the fleece lining definitely will keep you warm, especially while skiing. The neck warmer is the perfect length to keep my neck and chin warm, and the beanie is just the right size to cover her ears without sliding down over my eyes. She's worn this set on chilly walks around town and on ski trips, and it has held up great. The material is durable and the stitching is strong and secure. We would definitely recommend this set, and the price is affordable."
5.0,Giving this to my Mom for Christmas. She is gonna love it!
5.0,Love this dress.  Fits absolutely perfect!!  Durable material with a little bit of stretchiness.  Size chart is accurate.  Order by measurements.
5.0,Came in literally 3 days and these are PERFECT size. Will order again cause I like them so much! A++++ perfect flares and easy to get in awesome u guys!
5.0,"I got mine yesterday, and they are beyond adorable. I love that they have a post and some dangle to them! They really grab attention, I've gotten quite a few compliments. They're more than worth the money, trust me."
5.0,Warm and a lot of fun
5.0,"just as it looks great!!!! Fast ship, just as described I would get this again if I had to for sure"
5.0,"The hat is warm and comfortable, especially with the ear flaps. The soft material feels good when you put it on. I also like that you can put it in your suitcase or pack."
5.0,Purchased for my mom. She loves it.
5.0,Just keep in mind that US size Large = Asian size XXXXL. I purchased according to my measurements and the item fit me perfectly. When buying from China remember to only go by measurements and you won't have a problem with the fit.
5.0,My daughter loved these! She's a big LOTR fan.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for.  Each to adjust to size I needed and looks great.
5.0,"I love'em I wear them inside at work and outside whenever its not to sunny. My eyes have become very sensitive to light. and these take the harshness of oncoming headlights, and brite indoor lighting away<br />plus they fit nice & look good"
5.0,Hermosos y suevez
5.0,"I love this dress! It is soft and lightweight. Perfect for summer or with a cover for fall. Pockets on both sides, come on, who doesn‚Äôt LOVE POCKETSüíûIt is honestly perfect."
5.0,Loved the dress. I wished it would have fit. I returned it promptly.
5.0,This bracelet is absolutely stunning. Ut is so much more beautiful upfront. The tiny heart shape makes it a gorgeous gift for someone special.<br /><br />The bracelet is made of sterling silver with diamond accent on it. It gives it a real diamond look and makes it look more then it actually costs. It comes in a nice box too. I was pretty happy with the product.
5.0,great stuff - thanks
5.0,My son was constantly pushing his shirts into his armpits because he can‚Äôt stand the feeling of the shirt just grazing his underarms. I got him this shirt and he never wants to take it off. I quickly bought a second one. He wears one under his shirt every day now.
5.0,Best color! I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments! I will buy this in as many colors as I can find-very good size. Not too big. Perfect!
5.0,Got this for a costume party and it was perfect.  Very pretty little hat and the headband stayed on great without hurting my head.
5.0,I love the fact that the inner part has pockets.  It fits great!
5.0,"I really love this dress. It is comfortable. Easy to wash, inexpensive, has pockets, and is overall a great dress. I have bought several in different colors. My one complaint is the V neck gaps open a bit when sitting down.  I wear a camisole under.  The dress is not sheer. Very thick. You do not need to wear a slip."
5.0,These slides are super comfy!!!
5.0,My husband says....They feel amazing! Way better than I expected. It feels like i'm walking on a cloud. I would definitely recommend this foe ppl that stand all day and want to come home to some comfort.
5.0,"I got this to use stacked with other bracelets. I was a little leery of a magnetic closure on a bracelet, but it's stayed secure every time.  The stone beads look nice, same color as the black leather.  It's very light, I expected stone beads to add more weight, but it's nice that they don't because it means they aren't always rotating to the inside of my wrist.  It looks just like the photo in the listing. Really nice bracelet."
5.0,I was alittle worried that it wouldn't fit her curves but it does I could have went a size smaller. I will definitely buy again.
5.0,I love the case. Wish it had the shock absorber but someone actually thought I was holding a cassette tape.
5.0,Heavy duty. Comfy but durable.
5.0,Love my top.
5.0,"quality was way better than what I expected, my gf has been using it frequently for 6 months now. She used a seam ripper to take off the label and it looks a lot better. also comes with multiple pockets inside. would buy again!"
5.0,"I love this product. The material is excellent. The color is exactly what I needed and expected. It was a bit longer than I wanted, but this issue was very easy to be repaired. At the party where I wore it many people came to ask about it and make compliments. It had the effect I was looking for. I highly recommend this product."
5.0,The top is a comfortable bundle of softness!
5.0,I really like them I have always like locs
5.0,Great outfit bought for my sister she had a blast at a japanese fair
5.0,Excellent service<br />Pricesize measurements<br />Very pretty dress<br />Thank you

5.0,Excellent and nice
5.0,I love these glasses.  Exactly as described and yes they are polarized.  Great fit.
5.0,"I love the length! Long enough to use as a wrap anyway you like. I love the vibrant greens and purples, not a usual combination! Love it! Great value, too!"
5.0,I get a ton of compliments for these! Really fun to wear.
5.0,I have very sensitive ears in regards to metal and these really work great.  Awesome!!
5.0,awesome products
5.0,"Good fit, good weight, scrunches up and bounces back to form."
5.0,Cute. Looks exactly like photo.
5.0,I love this mask. I was worried it was going to be too big on me but it‚Äôs perfect for people who struggle with adult sized masks as an adult. I usually wear children‚Äôs size masks (regular medical mask are too big). This is a life saver!
5.0,"I purchased a XXL, I usually wear an XL but sized up because of other reviews but I think an XL would have done fine.  XXL will work tho especially if I wear long sleeves under it on cold days.  Comfy and soft.  I really like this shirt."
5.0,"BUY ONE! Best hat you'll ever own...  Super comfortable, extremely well made, flashy and smooth.  Waterproof and not to mention super fly!"
5.0,My daughter is over the moon about the MLP wallet Santa brought her. She has been storing Shopkins in it... ha.
5.0,My daughter loves these glasses ...says there so comfortable and help her see so much better in the sun..would expect to pay twice as much as we did...
5.0,I love that these earrings have screw on backs and the gem is very pretty.  Plus they are 14K gold!  They are perfect for my second piercing in my ears!
5.0,My best friend loved hers. Very happy with my purchase!
5.0,Cool and weird. Comfy. Lots of compliments.
5.0,"I gave this necklace to my daughter on her 16th birthday. The message that came with the necklace was exactly what I wanted to say to her on the special day. She loves the styling, it goes with many types of outfits, and it is of great quality for the price."
5.0,"Excellent for the Price, my Wife loves it....!!!!!"
5.0,"Soft, lightweight (which I like) can easily layer or wear by itself. Cute with leggings."
5.0,"I love your dress.  Thanks it has pockets!  Yep.  Said that a few times.  For the price, this dress was great,and decently made.  Pockets are large."
5.0,"Great for our 70s party . Even had enough for the pups. Strong plastic, good quality."
5.0,"Exactly as described.  Great quality and construction. Strap is thick and stitching is very well done; no ""wrinkling"" or ""crinkling"" like other, cheaper made plastic handbags.  Bag is great for NFL games and concerts requiring clear bags.  I highly recommend!"
5.0,I bought size 6mm and 7mm. They were easy to open/close. I wear the smaller ones in my tragus and 3rd whole on my left ear. I wear the 7mm in my right cartilage and the other in my left ddaith piercing. These are the only earrings that don't itch or turn my tragus piercing black. Thank you
5.0,I bought these for hiking and they are great!  Soft comfortable fabric.  Well cushioned and in just the right spots.
5.0,Perfect for my clutches
5.0,"I absolutely love this band! It is durable, bright, and solid-I have revived many compliments and I enjoy wearing it each day. Whenever it gets dirty, I take a soft toothbrush and some dish soap to it and it‚Äôs as good as new!  The best thing about this band, however, is the seller-when I first received it I had an issue with the band, needless to say the seller went out of their way to make sure I was happy with my purchase. I'm about to buy a second band and will do so from them again, because that‚Äôs rare these days-Thank you Bandmax!!!"
5.0,This is such a cute band.  Fits my Apple 3 42mm watch well.  Has 2 ‚Äúsnap‚Äù pieces to hold the band on so super secure and comfortable.
5.0,I've received many compliments on this necklace
5.0,"Beautiful, very secure post."
5.0,"everyone loved it, very comfortable, the colors are beautiful, love the long coat."
5.0,"I've wanted this  sweater for a while now & I'm so happy I finally bought it! It's not fitted, but it still fits nice, just as I expected. The colors are just as shown in the pictures posted. It's a little chunky, but i like that and its very warm, perfect for this weather. 100% acrylic"
5.0,Lo compre de regalo para la novia de mi hijo y le encant√≥
5.0,"5'7&#34; 145 lbs female with a big butt. Fits almost as expected... a teeny bit large, but not enough to fall off. A bit long. More comfortable with a belt. Heavy fabric, loose fit, nicely sewn pockets with good storage. Rings hang above the knee, pocket covers the knee (so if you put something hard in your pocket and fall, it'll hurt).. I'm considering buying a second pair."
5.0,"I bought these for my toddler's sneakers and they are so great!  It's so easy to get the shoes on and off and there is no hassle of tying laces or worrying about the trip hazard of untied laces.  I bought the XS and her size 9 sneakers only have 4 holes so I did have to get a little creative with how I laced them so they weren't too long, but they work great!"
5.0,"I got this hat on a great sale. I was skeptical at first, but when it arrived, the quality and weight of the product exceeded my expectations. I like the stiffness of the brim and overall shape of the hat. A+"
5.0,"I love these boots, they are edgy, very different than my usual boots and I have gotten several compliments on them. I won't tell my friend  where to buy them because I don't want to be twins with any of them, lol."
5.0,"Very nice necklace. The top loop hangs a little lower than a shirt neckline and the bottom hits about mid chest. Looks very vintage. I received many compliments when I have worn it. I have only had it about a month so I'm not sure if it will tarnish, but since it is not a bright, shiny metal, it shouldn't be obvious."
5.0,"I was a little iffy on ordering panties online but I'm so glad I took a chance on these. They fit perfect, they have the right amount of stretch, and they are soft! The material is exactly what I was hoping for. They feel so smooth, it's like not having panties on. I am 5'1, 152 pounds with a big caboose and the medium is just right."
5.0,Just beautiful!
5.0,I Love it.
5.0,So cute & comfortable.

5.0,Works wonderfully and love the feel of it!
5.0,I am really impressed with the dress.  I love it so much. I'm 5'2  and the length is little long but wearing heels with it looks perfect . The material is thick and I dont have to wear bra with it.  Love love it and wait to wear it.
5.0,Very nice shirt for the price..
5.0,"I ordered a size large as was recommended to order a size larger and they fit fine, I wanted to order another pair but they were out of mt size."

5.0,Nice looking earrings and affordable. Aiirived safely and quickly
5.0,So damn fun. Followed the previous reviews and sized up - so glad we did - fits well by sizing up.<br />It‚Äôs not high fashion but it obviously not meant to be.... let‚Äôs be honest let the tacky Christmas wear reign!!
5.0,Love these glasses litw weight and so comfortable
5.0,Lulu level quality with a better fit and price!<br />Only shorts I will workout in
5.0,Ordered a youth medium and fit my 9 year old perfect
5.0,"I LOVE this dress. I normally wear a medium or large, 10-14 depending on the brand, but ordered a 2xl after reading reviews. It fit like a glove. It's a super comfortable breathable material, and is very flattering. It requires a little bit of shapewear for a seamless look, but I will definitely be ordering more patterns of this dress!"
5.0,"Perfect size , love them"
5.0,I love the color of these pants.  I'm the snazziest student in my tai'chi/yoga class for seniors!
5.0,This is a very lightweight  tank but has good coverage.  I wore it under a semi-sheer top in very hot weather and was comfortable.
5.0,A bit pricey but well built.
5.0,Such quality socks. These socks are nothing short of festive and functional. They're not too thin but also not overly thick. The design is perfect and flawless. I'm crazy about Stance!
5.0,"I was so relieved to feel the nice weight material of this top. Darling. And I'm a size 16 and the XL fits perfectly.  Also, it's LONG ENOUGH so that it covers my size 16 tummy.  I wish they had it in Fall colors besides this brown - like dark green, magenta, navy -but they don't. Sad."
5.0,My 5 year old is happy with them
5.0,"It was a pair of good quality glasses, I bought it for my grandma. She said it is good."
5.0,super cute!!! theyre both very light weight and my eyes feel less strained RIGHT after i put them on. one side of the black pair doesnt close all the way (maybe bolted too tight) but ill just be extra careful...its still an amazing deal :)
5.0,I am a tall 2X gal and 3X fits good. High waste is flattering and orange is my color! Will buy another color.

5.0,My son uses the shoes for school
5.0,"La talla es exacta, tela gruesa de muy buena calidad. El color no desti√±e y se ha lavado dos veces x semana durante 1 mes.  Excelente inversi√≥n a un muy buen precio."
5.0,Like the vintage look of the lapel pin. A little small but well made.
5.0,Fits perfect.  Just as described
5.0,EASY TO INSTALL & USE

5.0,Gave it as a gift and my husband hasn't taken it off since!  Looks really nice.
5.0,Nice soft leather<br />Amazon should make it more clear which sizing they are using.
5.0,"I‚Äôve bought these for both cosplay and everyday functional use, and honestly they‚Äôve worked pretty much perfectly! The material is great, and the color is exactly what I was looking for. These leg warmers are must for both the cold and for fashion üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
5.0,Fit my 6 year old nephew perfectly! It‚Äôs also adjustable with is great.
5.0,This is really an amazingly nice scarf. The colors are more vibrant than the picture shows. Great scarf for the Southwest - just the right colors and design.

5.0,Fits well and the birthday boy loved it!
5.0,Affordable and stay on during the night. I'd purchase them again when needed.
5.0,These are the cutest gloves for cleaning.  It almost makes cleaning fun.  Love the doggies on the cuff and the extra long sleeves.  A must for the household chores.  I love them and highly recommend them!
5.0,"This tie is gorgeous!!! My husband looks fantastic in this tie. Our whole family wore white, gray & gold for our Christmas church outfits. This tie added in the gold for my husband."
5.0,Flattering to the body
5.0,"I wanted something different than a purse and instantly fell in love with this bag. I use it daily, it‚Äôs very comfortable and a perfect size for your wallet and even a Switch. (It can fit a Switch case as well too!)<br /><br />I‚Äôve had it for maybe 3 years now and it‚Äôs still in great condition. I‚Äôm always getting compliments about it."
5.0,Product everything as expected
5.0,Excelente producto. Gracias
5.0,I absolutely love this sweater dress. It fit  perfect.o
5.0,"not shoes, eyeglasses"
5.0,"Received this belt today & my husband LOVES IT!! As soon as I gave it to him, he loved it right away. We both loved how the belt was packaged in a really nice box. On top of that the belt was inside a small black bag inside the box. He also loved the way the belt is made. You can make the belt as lose as you want & as tight as you want. My hasband already wore it all day today & has no complain about it. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who like to wears belt. Great price for a great belt. You won‚Äôt be sorry!"
5.0,Love these in the summer
5.0,"Hubby goes thru rubber rings like crazy,  this was perfect!"
5.0,"I was looking for another hamalaya umbrella but they are no longer available. This looks like an exact copy of it, same handle/button/ribs. When fully open it isn't as sturdy so it will flex more in strong wind but still a good alternative."
5.0,Just as pictured.  Love it!  Classy!
5.0,Kid loves these. It‚Äôs hard to find bluey clothes so these made them super happy
5.0,"Great fit,very comfortable"
5.0,Size small was perfect fit. 5 3 and half 125
5.0,Fast shipping! Love them!!
5.0,Excellent night cap.  Fitted at the top of your head and loser in the back.  Perfect for keeping the top of my head flat.
5.0,Fits great.  Looks classy not cheap.
5.0,Although I loved it I could not fit it.  I ordered a XXXL and it looked more like a small to medium.  I gave it away as a gift because the quality was awesome for the price.
5.0,These are super cute boots. My daughter loves them.
5.0,I wear as an ankle bracelet. Many compliments
5.0,"These are fantastic. When stuffed in the little attached pouch, they are about the size of a tennis ball. I keep 2 in my car, one in my purse, and one in my bike basket! Super sturdy, too‚Äîthe handles are part of the fabric versus sewn on, so they will never rip off due to inadequate stitching."
5.0,"It's (very) inexpensive, yet gets the job done."
5.0,Very good Quality! Love it!
5.0,"I really like the feel of this plastic insert. It is a pliable, durable feeling material. Hopefully, it will stand up to the west Florida air quality, which is hard on plastics in general. The 12 pages provide lots of storage space, which means no doubling up for me...one card per insert. I ordered two of these inserts, one as a future replacement. I'm thinking I won't need it for a while. I would definitely buy this product again."
5.0,Beautiful and well made.  The band is smooth and the stones and style are pretty.
5.0,"Love this item, so comfortable and great quality!  Will continue to buy this product and in different colors."
5.0,"It is perfect. I was worried reading some of the comments about size. However, a large shirt is what i wear on a normal basis so i purchased a Large vest and it was the perfect size."
5.0,Fine items for any price.
5.0,Love this purse so cute
5.0,"These are great! Everything you want in a winter sock: warmth, comfort, softness and durability. The blend of wool, cotton and poly is perfect."
5.0,Love it and all the layers!
5.0,The item is exactly as shown. Beight in color and the details are clear. Would order again. Thank you.
5.0,"Very nice, but returned it because it didn't meet dress code policy"
5.0,"I ordered the exact size and it fit like a glove, Changed the shoe to look like new<br />The best ever. Thank you , Perfect product,"
5.0,I ordered a medium one size bigger. Fit very good. Nice blouse made well too.
5.0,Great value for the price ! Super comfy for the little one.
5.0,I really love it came in a 6.5 size... I would love another one with a double tie in yellow gold but can‚Äôt find it in size 6.5... maybe they can start carrying it üòÄ
5.0,I love these stupid little earrings. I have a mild metal allergy and these are the first I've had in a while that don't hurt my ears.
5.0,They were nice but to small.
5.0,"It's so cute. It's a little big on my wrist but I can always put a bracelet next to it so it kind of holds it in place. But it came clean, perfect, with no minor scratches. Love the little diamonds that move around."
5.0,In love with it super happy with this item!!
5.0,Earth shoes are supportive for your feet.
5.0,I love this!  So pretty and fun. Nice quality and quick shipping.
5.0,Very unique!
5.0,El size es buen peque≈Ño
5.0,It‚Äôs starting to get really cold. My home is pretty old.<br /><br />This blanket/sweater is really warm. I washed and dried it. It made it through the wash perfectly.<br /><br />Very cute and it‚Äôs so warm! I love it
5.0,GREAT bag!  Just the right size and plenty of space for all necessities!  Leather is good quality.  Would recommend!
5.0,Great summer stylish summer glasses. Love them!
5.0,Used it twice so far. Gets the job done nicely. Satisfied with my purchase
5.0,"Great fit. I‚Äôm usually an XL in tops and size 16 in jeans. I got the 3x and it fit even with my wide 51‚Äù hips, It does not have any stretch to it if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for but the material is very nice. Doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. I got red leggings to go with it and a white shawl."
5.0,"The hat is perfect to protect my ears and face from the sun.  Used it for golf and had no problems with it.  As far as I was concerned the whole hat could have been a little smaller, but it did the job of protecting my skin."
5.0,really soft on skin and great stretch
5.0,I absolutely love this dress.  The print is fantastic.  The material is cotton and perfect for summer.  It fit true to size.  Delivery was great.  Would buy again.
5.0,I loved this bag. It is all nylon & many departments & i am looking to purchase another 1 in a different color.
5.0,"I bought two to replace a couple of nylon shoulder bags I had used for years. These are great!! I love all the pockets, the bag fits close to the body, and the strap stays in place. I highly recommend this."
5.0,"Great quality shirt, my daughter wants to wear it every day."
5.0,"These soccer socks are so cute. My daughter is 3 but the size of a 2 year old, in 24 month clothing currently. These socks are the perfect fit and they hit just above her knees. After running and moving around for a while they do slouch a little, but I don‚Äôt know any comfortable fitting socks that wouldn‚Äôt. She does not wear shinguards yet but if she did they would help keep the socks in place. There should be enough room to add shinguards. My only wish is that you could pick which colors you want, but for the price we will live with the white ones we don‚Äôt really want."
5.0,"Get adorable- the closest I have ever come to wearing something like this previously was my wedding day, so I'm not sure how they compare to other petticoats, but the size was as expected and it looks adorable, adding the desired shape and a fabulous pop of color.  The pictures tell the story!<br /><br />My waist is 29 inches, my hip is 37, I got a small, red.<br /><br />I recieved a sample in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
5.0,got this as a nice night out hand bag. it's the right size and i can fit my phone and make up with wallet nicely. small but compat.
5.0,Very cute necklace....fast shipping. Happy customer!
5.0,It Perfect To Go With The Ugly Sweater Christmas Party Our Family Is Going To Have
5.0,"I bought two of these, one in the Rose Gold, and one in Silver. My Granddaughters LOVE the necklaces. They are actually taking good care of them and wear them to Church and other special occasions. The price was right for a 'first' cross for the girls."
5.0,This is a well made dress . I liked it so much I bought another.<br />Washes well .. no shrinking. Buy your normal size .
5.0,Love these pants - so much so that I bought two pairs.
5.0,"Very detailed work, it's very pretty."
5.0,Love these pants. Super comfy and well made. I should‚Äôve ordered short as they are a touch too long-but I‚Äôm short so my bad.
5.0,I love these! Super fun and the perfect dupe!
5.0,It fits perfectly and I need the straps so the ocean breeze will not blow my hat away!
5.0,Love them came earlier than expected. Which is a total plus
5.0,From cruise ship to beach. I was able to pack 2 huge cruise ship pool towels plus the usual beach products.
5.0,Son loves it for his phone.
5.0,Good material nice quality but the colors I didn't like that much
5.0,"I loved the way it fit, plus it was warm. Will buy again, perhaps getting one in another cooler."
5.0,Bought this for my daughter to wear for her birthday party. Ordered last minute and it was here on time. Thought based off of looking that it was too big until she put it on and it was a perfect fit. Very cute and everyone loves the outfit!
5.0,I received this bracelet as a gift recently! I love it and can tell the difference almost immediately!!
5.0,Looks just like the picture and like it says. A lot prettier in front of you. Makes a great present!
5.0,"My shirt arrived on time and fit perfectly, I didn't wan't my flab to show and it doesn't! very loose and comfortable."
5.0,I‚Äôm a Betty Boop fan. This was nice to add to my collection
5.0,The glasses allow you to see much more than I thought. The pattern does not get in the way.
5.0,I‚Äôve worn this type of bracelet for years. Took a chance (because price was so good and much less then I‚Äôve been paying in stores) and purchased and absolutely love it. Got compliments the first time I wore it. Will be back for more
5.0,"This looks just as pictured! Wool makes me itchy, but this sweater is so soft and comfortable, not to mention it is warm! I bought this in both black and white and love it!"
5.0,Work great!  No show socks with a little bit of adhesive to help keep them up.
5.0,"Even cuter than I'd imagined! The shells' coverage is spot on and because I'm soooo pale, the mesh really blends in with my skin tone. The only thing I would caution is that if you're small yet busty, the straps may feel a little too tight HOWEVER I have very narrow shoulders so the straps are at a different angle than most people would experience. The seams all look very secure and the legging portion has plenty of stretch, but so far has returned to size without sagging."
5.0,"I absolutely adore this skirt. It's beautiful and the colors are perfect they look very similar to the picture. I love the little embellishments that are on it making it sparkle a bit. It's lightweight and good even in warmer weather it breaths and isn't stuffy.I like the drawstring waist that allows it to fit almost anyone and it's very comfortable. It has the main skirt, that is sheer, with the color on it and an underskirt that adds to it's flair and cover."
5.0,"I love these shoes! I‚Äôve owned the higher priced shoes, but prefer these 100%! These shoes are super comfy, easy to slip on, and feel like I‚Äôm walking on clouds."
5.0,"This watch truly is the sweet spot between your entry level seiko divers and the almighty marinemaster 300. It‚Äôs outstanding. Not a huge fan of the bracelet but only because the center links have a flat design with cornered edges. It‚Äôs not a traditional oyster with the rounded links. All in all, amazing watch and my favorite seiko."
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous!
5.0,"Purchased as my Kate Spade &#34;in memory&#34; and very happy I did.  It;s on the back of my phone, so it doesn't leave room for the comfort add on button,  I love cats, so this wins.  RiP Kate Spade."
5.0,"Everything as shown. Beautiful watch, I love it."
5.0,"good quality, good material."
5.0,wears comfortable
5.0,Everything was perfect from delivery to fit.
5.0,Just as described brand new.

5.0,Execelente calidad
5.0,"Great sun glasses, great price"
5.0,bought for husband and stepdad and they both found them useful.<br />GREAT GIFT

5.0,Love these glasses‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,Quality leather band.
5.0,It's comfortable. And looks good. I am a big fan of this eSports team.
5.0,Keeps my key protected from damage.
5.0,The material is absolutely wonderful. You can wear as pajamas or outside as tshirt. Best buy I've made to date
5.0,"These soft are thin but I would almost call them medium thickness.  I have some dress socks that are so thin that you can see through them.  Those are really nice in the summer but not great in the winter.  I also have some really thick dress socks that are excellent in the winter and can be worn in the summer but these are right in the middle.<br /><br />They are comfortable and it is nice to have 6 pairs that are identical so you do not have to match them up one to one.  I have sets with different designs or socks that I bought individually and although they are nice, it is harder to match them.  I can wear these all day long and not get lines on my legs from the elastic bands.<br /><br />They are simple and comfortable."
5.0,"Honestly, tight at first, but after 2 wears, seems like a shoe I will be showering in for months."
5.0,This is the cutest set EVER!  I only wish it came in my size.<br /><br />Typical of Hanna products it is soft on arrival and only gets softer with washing.  Colors are vibrant and stay that way.<br /><br />Love
5.0,The band looks good and the quality is good. I would recommend this to others.
5.0,"I love the material and it fits like a glove, I wear a 12-14 usually in dresses because of by breasts, a large fits perfect.beautiful orange color"
5.0,"Great color, size, quality, price"
5.0,My daughter saw some earrings like this on some foreign website that was going to take forever to ship and not make it by Christmas. She had no idea these were not the same and she loves them!
5.0,Works as expected and looks really cool!
5.0,I'd purchase again and again. Great shirts! Great length. Too often shirts are too short but these are perfect.
5.0,"The dress is soft, airy for summer and fits perfect. Love it!"
5.0,Todo excelente
5.0,This is a heavy ass ring. I mean it‚Äôs huge but well worth the money.
5.0,"I used the dress For a wedding, and I got so many compliments. Size Fitted  little big but still Look wonderful."
5.0,"Lightweight fabric, super cute"
5.0,"Drove 6 hours in the rain at night, it made it possible!!!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:c7e15e36e0e71c51cfb37e2357295a6b]]Years ago, my hubby use to wear Bikini Briefs sometimes and then he changed to boxer briefs and boxers and I miss seeing him in the bikini type underwear so I decided to purchase him some again. I have always liked the way he looked in them and they definitely have a more sexy look on him than his boxers. He wears a size 32 waist pants so I ordered the Medium and they fit him fine.<br /><br />I was actually quite surprised at the material of these. The front area is very thick and definitely much higher quality than the ones I use to get him. In the front, there is even a little extended pouch area for their goods so they are not tight and confined in them. The waistband is nice and wide and it's comfortable and doesn't pinch him nor does he have an issue with it rolling down on him.<br /><br />He and I both like how these have an accenting color to them on the front too. Granted they are just underwear but the contrasting colors on the front really add to the look of these. They do not have a back tag in them so there is no irritation or scratching from one. There is however a very small tag on the side seam which just gives the material made with and the size so that one can be removed easily if it bothers you. All the stitching on these is double and triple stitched and all done well. There were no loose seams or threads at all. These washed up well in the washer and dryer and there was no shrinking to them. Overall, a really nice set of Bikini underwear by Dimore that I would recommend. I have other underwear from this company and they never seem to disappoint me.<br />I received this product at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
5.0,Love this shirt and the material is so soft!
5.0,Added this watch to my G-Shock collection and am very pleased!
5.0,Beautiful addition to my summer wardrobe!
5.0,Very soft material.  Very true to size. I'm a size 16 and ordered an XL. fits perfectly.
5.0,"I purchased my husband a Masonic dog tag that I had engraved with his installation dates.  However, this was large and he is not a chain person by nature, let alone with a large, heavy pendant on it.  This charm is just PERFECT.  He loves it and wears it CONSTANTLY.  He NEVER takes it off and even sleeps in it.  It's very noticable to others and gets commented on.  He's proud to show it off.  It was by far one of the best items I've purchases for him that he USES!"
5.0,"I ordered this top in both a M and L (in white) and decided to keep the large.  I'm usually an XS/0; while both sizes fit, I liked the looser and slightly longer fit of the size large so I can wear with fitted pants, plus I can adjust the tightness of the waist with the tie.  The sleeves aren't as long as pictured, more of a loose cap sleeve that goes a little past your shoulders.  Overall this top looks very chic and at a good price point."
5.0,Dress fit great. Tighter than the pictures but it has great stretch and flexibility to accentuate your waist and chest without looking tight! I would buy it in more colors if I needed it!
5.0,We love these shoes they fit perfect and amazing quality!!!
5.0,Sent on time - great looking watch.
5.0,What perfect with my dress
5.0,Looks really nice. Haven't wore it yet.
5.0,"I have triple piercings, so this little set of three pairs is perfect! They are small enough to be worn next to each other‚Äînice simple basics! The loops are great for sleeping. My only critique is that there was a lot of plastic packaging. I wish they wouldn‚Äôt put everything into an individual bag and then into a larger bag."
5.0,Very cute necklace!  Made of metal.  Not too heavy.  Cute purchase.
5.0,"Soft cloth. Not sure anyone likes to wear them, but at least this has a nice design."
5.0,Just too long
5.0,Love them. Fit perfect. Not see thru at all. Good fabric.
5.0,Love the designer of these ear rings
5.0,My boyfriend loved these! I wanted him to wear them indoors but he wears them outside as well and they are fine!
5.0,Very nice product and delivery.  Thank you.
5.0,My daughter and her friends loved it!! It‚Äôs very beautiful!!
5.0,Nice thank you
5.0,Great Value:)
5.0,item arrived on time and as described.
5.0,This was a last minute I-don‚Äôt-know-what-shoe-to-wear-with-this dress situation. So happy they arrived! Shoes look exactly as pictured and have a sparkle to them. They were comfortable enough to wear throughout the trip after the wedding to give my outfits a dressier look!
5.0,These are very breathable and soft. they fit my son great and they also fit my hands. they are so comfortable and will save his hands from falls. He loves them.
5.0,"It says men's, but I got this for my wife. She does cosplay around the room more than I do, and I thought this looked like a lot of massage oil fun."
5.0,Someone asked to buy the shirt off me. That is how you know it looks good! haha
5.0,This dress is very cute  and the color is beautiful. The material is very good and breathable.
5.0,"This jumpsuit is a 10! Great fit/cut, unique and flowy üôå"
5.0,perfect fit. i get so many compliments! I have the red one and the gray one.
5.0,The cow tag necklace is a bit bigger compared to the other ones than you see online. I loved that it was bigger because you could see better details. The straight necklace is bigger also. The necklaces are shown like they are equal sizes but they aren't. The chains are nicer than you would expect also.
5.0,"This is a really nice sweatshirt. The material is a good quality and it's well designed and made.<br /><br />It fits true to size but I ordered a size up because I like to wear sweaters and sweatshirts as an outer layer on top of another shirt and it fits just as I expected.<br /><br />It's lightweight, but not too light because it's still really warm. This will be great for when the weather turns a little cooler which will be pretty soon now.<br /><br />I like the colors, which are subdued, but the light and dark and the pattern work well together. Also, this is almost a sweater rather than a sweatshirt -- it doesn't have that fleecy feel inside like regular sweatshirts, but it's not scratchy.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty nice shirt for the price. It's durable and washes up well without any noticeable shrinkage."
5.0,"These compression tanks are prefect for under your dress shirts and golf shirts. They keep you ""tucked"" in just enough."
5.0,"Nice fabric, true black color and true to size. I'm a size 14 US and the XL fits perfectly."
5.0,This is the most comfortable nightgown I‚Äôve ever bought. It is lightweight and flowy and the  pockets are a plus.
5.0,Me encaron son lindas igual ala fotos
5.0,"This is a nice set, I wore it to a wedding and had a lot of great comments on the tie!"

5.0,couldn't be better. These earrings are perfect for people who don't like to change their earrings everyday. They are perfect for sleeping in. They never get caught on towels and that is why I love hinges.
5.0,Love this dress. Comfy and cute. I'm 5'4 170lbs and got a large.
5.0,"You get what you pay for. bracelet is very nice for the price. That &#34;silver&#34; looks very cheap but it's a cute bracelet and I have fun wearing it. Haven't gotten any compliments though, one way or the other. Feels good on my wrist. Packaged well."
5.0,This watch is a great pigpen character watch! I love it! The only frustrating was that that it took over a month to be delivered..
5.0,Bought it as a gift and my friend loves it.
5.0,Great pair of shoes! Typical character shoe feel. They even light up! (I was unaware of this until we got them) they light up with white lights. Really nice shoes for a hard to find show!!

5.0,I work out a lot and wanted a comfy workout shirt that wasn‚Äôt huge. I‚Äôm sort and often they are so long on me. I ordered my usual size and they fit perfect.  I will order more in different colors !!
5.0,My friend loved it for his wallet and it doesn't make his wallet bulky.
5.0,I'm absolutely in love with this vest.  It's amazing how many things you can fit into this lightweight vest.  I love that I can insert my hydration bladder into the back pocket. Fits comfortable and does not move around.<br /><br />My new trail running gear must have!
5.0,These look even more lovely in person! I plan to wear them in my wedding :)
5.0,"My daughter said this is one of her favorite gifts, she absolutely loves it!!"

5.0,"went to the Alaska Tundra on a mission trip temperatures varied from 7 degrees to 29 degrees F. Did its Job kept heat in and felt no discomfort whatsoever at times I even got hot when I layered, wish I would of bought a smaller size I bought two sizes bigger in anticipation for heavy layering and didn't need them. not sure about negative temperatures but for me a hoodie and this jacket were more then enough."
5.0,"Great bib , fits good, comfortable and warm, not noisy when walking, I love mine."
5.0,This is a good quality and hilariously annoying doge hat.
5.0,"I wear a 7 5/8&#34; fitted cap, although abit big on me after washing in hot water and drying on high heat, the cap fits me appropriately now. Great quality for the money!"
5.0,Look great but may be just a touch over scaled (too big). They would be better just a hair smaller. Better than spending $500 on the actual Dita Flight pair.
5.0,Cute and comfortable with a little bit of swankiness!
5.0,he loved it
5.0,Recommend this dress! So cute and comfy!

5.0,Good quality for a dress up hat!!
5.0,"it is soft, colorful, long and is versatile."

5.0,"Yall, you have no idea how often I have wished for a belt that didn't have a front buckle but still held your pants up!!!<br />Fashionwise, no one will know you're wearing a belt if you decide to do the cute front tuck with your shirt!!<br />Trust me, these will keep your pants up!!<br />Also these belts make great dress belts if you wanted to sinch a flowy dress at the waist!!<br />And I love the colors!! Especially the camel one!!<br />Although I will say there's a risk in your belt loops ripping especially if you clip the belt snaps on and if you tighten the belt a lot.<br />But I still 100% recommend it!!"
5.0,Very satisfied with purchase
5.0,Such a cute dress! It‚Äôs excellent quality. I got my actual size but if you‚Äôre bustier than a B i would size up! Follow me on Instagram @thefashiondoctorsfinds for all of my amazon finds!

5.0,Great hat very patriotic made well fits well AAA +++
5.0,"I can't say enough about how pleased I am with these sunglasses. I have several pairs and haven't been wearing them because of how uncomfortable they are. Not true with these sunglasses. I had them on for most of yesterday during the day. They fit well, don't slide down my nose and don't leave marks on the side of my head. They are well made but light, which is one of the reasons as to why they are so darn comfortable. The shade that I chose is just right for me. I can see everything just fine, but without the distracting glare. I really like the spring hinges. They work well and without having to worry about bending the frames. The case the sunglasses came in is well made and I appreciate having something to store the sunglasses in that will actually protect them from being damaged. I am going to order a second pair, just in case I lose the first pair.<br /><br />For The Record: My name is not Michael, and I didn't use to be a spy."
5.0,"Such a great concept.  Easy triggers in the palm make biking at night safe. The On/off button on the outside makes saving battery life easy. They have a velcro strap to adjust for your hand size. I like the color as well..it's like a cool ocean blue.<br />This is a great item for bikers. .<br /><br />In the spirit of full disclosure,  I received this item free to facilitate my review."
5.0,There great!
5.0,Me encanto. Sobretodo el empaque. Me sorprendio vino en una hermosa funda de tela hecha a mano y un sticker de Santiago de Compostela. Rapido lo puse en mi auto.! Buen Camino.!!
5.0,Love!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,Gorgeous sunglasses.  Bought them as gifts and own my own.
5.0,"I tried several different products to clean my boots but nothing was doing the job. A friend recommended this product and was not disappointed. It worked the first time a round! Followed the instructions and worked like a charm, highly recommend."
5.0,I use them as Hijab pins. They are simple to pin on don't come off easily.
5.0,I think it's a really nice lanyard. It's described perfectly. I had no issues with it. I however stopped using it for my phone. I just did not feel safe having my phone dangling from a breakaway lanyard. It's perfect for card keys. I don't think it should be used for expensive phones.
5.0,Love this purse. Very well made.  There is a lot of room for all your necessities that you need. The color is exactly what is pictured.  I highly recommend this purse.
5.0,Love this necklace.  It's large enough to be noticed and has bright color and shine.  It came in a lovely gift box.

5.0,Bought these for a ‚ÄòGrandma‚Äô Christmas party.  Purchased fresh water oyster pearls they opened and put in these charms. A great hit!!
5.0,"Pretty color, good heaviness without being bulky."
5.0,"Small..  Good quality but definitely for kids 9 or under.  My son is 10 years old and he is one of the shortest ones in his class, they barely fit. He wore them anyways but the truth is if we had had time we would have exchanged them.for larger ones."
5.0,"Awesome for the price. I have always had a hard time finding necklaces this long, even though I think they look better with a lot of outfits. I've worn this necklace a few times now and it hasn't tarnished, or anything."

Will order another color for a December event."

5.0,"Works awesome for long, thick hair!"
5.0,"I spend a lot of time working in front of a computer and like so many people, I tend to lay down my glasses somewhere and completely forget (often on the top of my own head). I keep these as my emergency pair just in case. Of course, it is only a matter of time before I can't find these either."
5.0,I received 2 of these necklaces. One was missing some stones and the other one was fine. I wore it with a blouse the same color and it looked amazing.
5.0,I love these. They are very cute and comfortable. Great price also. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase. They are also pretty sturdy. I hate it when a ring can bend easily but these don‚Äôt.
5.0,"Great fit with just enough stretch, Knee length rich color"
5.0,"Love the quality of wallet, the RFID safety feature, and the fact that it came in so many color choices. You might consider incorporating one space with clear plastic for picture ID. thank you so much"

5.0,"This dress is really cute, flattering and comfortable. And! It has pockets! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 130ish lbs and medium fits great. Lightweight yet heavy enough to drape nicely.

5.0,"I have a condition that makes my skin extremely sensitive and, over the years has gotten to the point where I can no longer wear pierced earrings or even tight clip-ons.  Finally they are coming out with cuffs and earrings like this one!  It is wonderful!  It comes in a small velvet pouch in wonderful condition.  It only took a couple of days to get it AND I can wear it without even feeling it!  If the stones didn't swing I would forget I had it on.

5.0,This portfolio is well made and works just as it should.
5.0,"I love this ring! The only down side is that i ordered a wrong size and it was too big.But that was my fault! Not their fault,It was mine.So i would say to buy this ring but remember that rings don't &#34;live&#34; forever.So buy this ring if you want to look cool and awesome but the colors will not &#34;live&#34;.(Well,At least mine did not.Also,I had it for like two weeks and its starting to lose it's colors.)Thanks for viewing my post and Have An Awesome Day!"

5.0,"I bought the brown color tote. Beautiful made bag & fast delivery. I purchased the black one from this seller in the past. Very satisfied, thank youu."
5.0,"I read the other good reviews and loved the way the jacket looked so I ordered it, still a little skeptical. But it all is true!  They do call you to get exact measurements, and they rushed shipping for no extra charge, so I had it in plenty of time for Christmas.  They also called and texted me to make sure everything was ok.  I gave the jacket to my husband a few days early, because it was also for his birthday (Christmas and Bday combined).  He loves, loves it!!  It really is all what the others say.  The best customer service I have had.  If only other companies were this way.  Very impressed!  I rarely leave a review.  That is how impressed I am!  Wow!"
5.0,me encantaaaaan

5.0,"My cat loves watching what I'm doing when I am on the computer. This is extremely inconvenient when I'm gaming as I shift in my seat and he inevitably loses balance or becomes agitated and tries to reseat himself on my mousepad (Kitten, no! My SR!)<br /><br />This solved that problem for me. It is comfortable and warm for me and my cat. I can shift as I please without him slipping. He often falls asleep in it!<br /><br />I wear a large in US Men's, so I ordered the 3xl. It is just right for me, comfortably baggy."
5.0,"Fit kids and adult.  Propeller spins perfectly and the bow ties are adorable.  We used them on a family vacation, it made it so easy to keep track of everyone!"
5.0,Producto llego rapido! Y es exactamente como se ve en la imagen
5.0,I have 5 of these nightgowns in various colors.  They are great to wear and hold up well in the laundry

5.0,Really cute purse! Smaller size which I like and the multi colors go with everything.
5.0,"Authentic, and very nicely made.  The blouse that comes with it is nice and more reasonable than most- no absurdly plunging neck line, but also not prudish either.  Length was exactly what I was hoping for- about mid-to-high shin height on a 5' 2&#34; frame.  Sizing is spot on with correct measurements taken.  Bottom line is that this is a very nice dress, well-made, and will last a lifetime if taken care of."
5.0,Love this dress. Fits well and the fabric is comfy and sexy. Perfect for valentines day ‚ù§Ô∏è Highly recommended and also delivered before expected which is a plus
5.0,Love this!  I've had so many compliments!
5.0,Love the overall style and comfort for our son. He loves it!
5.0,I loved the first pair enough to buy a second one! Excellent quality and fits as expected! I love the pocket for my phone.
5.0,"So many compliments on this. Casual but not sweatshirt looking. Can wear with linen pants or leggings. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù, still perfect with leggings. Ordered xxl as I wanted it roomier."
5.0,"Love these! I can have the look without putting a hole in my nose. Some of them hurt because the spring is tight, but I'm usually not wearing them all day."
5.0,"Good set for family of four. Had no issues so far, used it 4 times."
5.0,"Sturdy, soft and perfect length."
5.0,It is nice to have a pair of pplain and simple earrings to wear.
5.0,"It's my favorite ring it's soooo cute, I love it."
5.0,"Somewhat large, but that's OK. This type of dress is supposed to be roomy. Very comfortable."
5.0,Great pants very comfortable
5.0,Just received these in the mail for my bridesmaids and absolutely love them! They look so classy especially for the price! Feel sturdy and made well. Thank you for helping me pick a great gift for my girls!
5.0,"I ordered this dress as a costume for Lucy Wilde from Despicable Me 2 and it was perfect! The dress fit very well, although it was a bit loose fitting before washing and drying so keep in mind it will shrink just a bit. It was very comfortable and the cut was very flattering, it hid my little bit of baby weight very well."
5.0,"Fit was awful. Very pointy, unfortunately!"
5.0,Hubby just loves it so glad I went for it.
5.0,"Absolutely love it! I am 148lbs and 5' 2"" I ordered a medium. It's very very comfortable and I LOVE that it has pockets!"
5.0,This is a very well made product.  My daughter loves it. I like to know her eyes are safe.  I would order more but stopped shipping to PR.
5.0,I love this dress Figure flattering True to size
5.0,"I absolutely feel in love with there earrings! buy people! It took a very long time, but the seller IS making them by hand, so that's ok. I make a lot of things by hand and I know it does take a while to make things. They looked so cute, they looked so professional! And the packaging was so cute too! It felt like a gift x). Worth the wait, terrific buy for me thank you so much! I'm about to buy another pair right now  :D. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"I love this swim suit, it's flattering and comfortable!"
5.0,Loved the design of hat once I received it.  It was a gift my son loves it and it adjusted to where he needed it.
5.0,"i am very patriotic, this sparkles, moves - it is very cool. Has a little bling - what more you could ask for."
5.0,These are so cute
5.0,"Great size and colors for fall and winter.  Came in handy at movie theater, used it as a blanket for 5 y.o. and myself in reclined seats."
5.0,"This is a pretty good belt, especially for the price. I wish it were a little more adjustable, but it still fits. I am thinking of getting the black one. They were sold out at the time though."
5.0,I used these on a trip to London. My feet did not swell and my legs felt great. First time I used compression socks. But travel has made my legs swell when sitting too long so someone recommended compression socks and these worked great.
5.0,"As an 80's baby, I love to see items as well as brands that once ran a muck during my upbringing, back to the forefront of the purchasing world."
5.0,Very cute and very well made
5.0,Bought for my granddaughter and she loves it
5.0,"I cannot speak from personal experience since these are for my children, however....they LOVE them. They first used them at camp. They only had a few pairs at camp and everyone fought over them. My son didn't want to swim without them.  They fit well, they are comfortable and they don't leak at all."
5.0,Really good bike short for the price.  Does a good job of giving cushion and support while cycling.  Will buy some more of these :)
5.0,"This is a really cute two-piece workout outfit. The ribbed fabric is both flattering and supportive. I love the olive green color too!  It does have removable pads, so it should work for any size chest. The rouched back and smoothed cheeks makes the booty pop too!<br /><br />The shorts are high waisted, which is very flattering for any figure. I got a medium, which I typically get, and it fits pretty true to size. The ribbed fabric seems really elastic and forgiving for all body types. I like the fact that it‚Äôs two pieces, so I have a perfect OUTFIT for working out and don‚Äôt need to find two coordinating pieces.<br /><br />I recommend this set!"
5.0,Old school round the way girl.
5.0,"High quality sturdy and stylish.  The frames are commercial quality and give off an expensive vibe<br /><br />I bought 4 pairs and leave them at the office, car and my home. Lenses are clear and optically correct<br /><br />Nice and stylish while being functional"
5.0,"Great deal!  The color is a pale gold, not too yellow like it looks in the photo.  Will work great with an ivory shirt for our wedding."
5.0,"Great flow & drape, slinky fabric with a lovely amount of stretch. I ordered a 3X in magenta & navy print which looks even BETTER in person. I'm 5'8""--and a women's size 26-28. I knew the 3x would be snug, and it is--but it's nothing a good pair of spanx can't fix. If I was a true 3x, I have no doubt this would fit like a dream. As to the HiLo hem-- this is a mock wrap skirt, no worries about wardrobe malfunction. The front drape split comes to below my knee in my bare feet when worn as a skirt. Perhaps because of the print, I didn't notice any sheer/transparency issues with the fabric. It's solidly full coverage.<br /><br />If wearing as a gown-- a skinny belt and a bolero, cardigan, or shrug tranforms this lovely skirt into a super cute HiLo dress. The front split is about 2-3 inches above the knee for me (5'8""), but if you're significantly taller, it might wind up hitting higher on your thighs.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, get this dress! I'll be picking up more in other prints."
5.0,Super cute. I like how the heck isn‚Äôt too high like all of the other Dorothy costumes
5.0,Daughter loves this top.
5.0,I love it you can see clearly not too dark just right..
5.0,It arrived on time. It has a long strap so it fits larger heads comfortably. It is comfortable and durable and wears well if you sweat a lot. I would recommend it.
5.0,"I have been looking for two winters for mittens that fit on my toddler's hands without being too difficult to get on or making it so she can't use her hands. Currently, she is two years old. These mittens are her favorites and work well.<br /><br />I love the zipper on the side. It makes the mittens much easier to get on than other insulated mittens. They have quite a long cuff, which fits over the sleeve of her coat and makes it less likely for snow to get in.<br /><br />They look as pictured, and are so well liked that I currently can't find them, which leads me to recommend that you order a backup pair. Hope you like them as much as we do!"
5.0,This shirt is super cute. And fits really well. But it took almost eight months for me to retrieve it. I ended up just canceling the whole order after a month or two. It finally came at the beginning of Summer
5.0,I bought this for work. I try not to dry clothes I buy in the dryer cuzz they could shrink. This did not love it. I work in a cooler cutting fruit it‚Äôs under 40 degrees in the cooler. Love it
5.0,"Have you ever purchased from Amazon a product you love and tried to reorder but it was no longer available? I wore these one day and decided to reorder before they disappeared. These bras are as comfortable as wired bras can be, provide full coverage, and have the perfect amount of lining so as not to be embarrassed no matter how thin your blouse is. So, yes, I ordered more after I wore these. I highly recommend! ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
5.0,Perfect add on to the bag.
5.0,"When ordering this product, I did not expect that it would be so high quality and soft üòç"

5.0,Love this.. read and watch tv at the same time

5.0,I love them ! I have always liked the shield sunglasses.
5.0,Great lenses. Easy to replace. Made my favorite pair of sunglasses brand new again. I will definitely recommend Revant to my friends and family.
5.0,Gave as a gift to a drummer. She loved it. Comes in a nice velveteen satchel for nice presentation.
5.0,I‚Äôve purchased these backless bras before from other websites and tbh after a few times I couldn‚Äôt use them anymore. But Rosmax bras have a really good quality. You can have them all day on and it feels like nothing. Very comfortable!
5.0,"These are AMAZING! I bought them thinking they were just going to be black leggings, even though the description said ‚Äòcolorful‚Äô, but to my surprise they have this awesomely subtle rainbow sparkle to them. My daughter is going to love them when she sees them! I haven‚Äôt been able to test their fit, but the leggings are very thick, and appear to be really well made. I want a pair!"
5.0,Good face masks
5.0,Bought it for my cousin graduation and she loves it
5.0,Soft and like the length of shirt (longish) and sleeves
5.0,"Excelent: size, desing, color, price, shipping time."
5.0,If you are busty then this swimsuit is for you. I am 5'6&#34; 140 pounds 34DDD-28-36 and it is hard to find the right swimsuit. I came across this one and I took a chance and ordered it and let me tell you I am so happy that I did. It fits better than I ever could have hoped for.
5.0,I love this bag - beware though it is huge.
5.0,I bought these to use out in the desert to protect myself from sand and debris  took them for a test ride  on my  Harley  and  I  love them  very breathable and protects me  very well from bugs at 80mph+. Definitely will purchase again. Thanks for a quality product üëå
5.0,"These are so good-looking in person! I‚Äôm a sucker for a good buy on Celtic items for my hubby to wear, and these did not disappoint!!! They‚Äôre a fabulous item for the price, and he loved receiving them as a gift. They look so super classy when worn! I‚Äôve definitely taken note to check out this brand‚Äôs other items going forward."
5.0,I love this cute... but also very handy little compact readers to keep in your handbag... pocket... computer bag... or anywhere you want. In fact... I put it on a release clip and attached it to the inside of my handbag.
5.0,"Super comfy, super cute, well made, fit great. All around awesome. (I got a medium for B cup 155lbs and 5'3)"
5.0,Beautiful detail and colors! Daughter is very happy with it. Good great with her guitar which has red around the outer edges.
5.0,Daughter is obsessed! She loves them. Cards are a nice quality and so is the bracelet
5.0,"Have worn these for many years.  Slightly different fabric this time, which gives the garment more flexibility.  A little long, but the large fits my size 14 torso very comfortably."
5.0,Great buy.. it fit as expected
5.0,I love this bag! Size is perfect and I love the color
5.0,It arrived PROMPTLY. The quality of the fabric and manufacturing were great. My only complaint was that it was high waisted and I usually don't have this problem when I order online so it must be the manufacturers interpretation of sizes. I returned it because that was something that affected the look on me. I really liked the dress. It fit in all other areas.
5.0,Looks just like it does in the photo. Quality materials and a good size. I'm very happy with it.
5.0,Comfortable. Seem good so far.
5.0,Support is the best!
5.0,"The scarf feels like it is soft silk, the colors are vivid and bright, and the print is sharp and crisp.  The length is convenient enough to wrap around your neck at least twice over.  It is also long enough to be draped around your shoulders.  Overall, an excellent scarf to bring color. style, and panache to your winter wardrobe."
5.0,"I love this cap.  It is nicely made. The fabric feels very light, and soft.  I like the fact that it has two buttons on each side to eliminate pressure on the ears."
5.0,Really soft material. Great cut / fit.
5.0,It looked great and I'm super glad I got it in a large it was only a little short in the legs for me. I wore it for 4 days at a convention and it held together amazingly. Super soft as well.
5.0,The fit was perfect and the most comfortable pjs I‚Äôve ever worn.  They are cool in the hot weather.
5.0,"Very versatile. It's especially perfect for when you for any reason need to adjust your belt with little sizes. It also stretches so if you normally wear M size, I'd suggest going with S with this one."
5.0,Husband very happy. Slippers very comfortable and warm. Recommend.
5.0,Work better than vacuum bags
5.0,I really loved this necklace.  I got one for my mom and then one for me.  the small jewelry bag that is came with was a nice touch
5.0,I bought 00g. Can't wait to try them. Just received them! They're beautiful! Very colorful. The only default with them was my opal/ clear pair. One of them had a small bubble in one of the plug but to me that just adds character considering how gorgeous the entire set was ü§ó very pleased
5.0,This is a nice raincoat.  I had it on for about 20 minutes and received a compliment from a store clerk while I was shopping.  I must say that I agree totally!  The length and sleeves are just perfect and this was no chemical smell emanating from the vinyl.
5.0,"Nice Dress! Fit great because the material is kind of stretchy, so even if the size isn't perfect it still looks good!"
5.0,This coat is exactly what I wanted.  It goes great with a dress and jeans with boots.  It also has a really nice fit and flair to it.  Very happy.

Was nice to see him in the mask bc he Likes the Marvel movies and all the cool superheroes!  A lot of his friends really like the masks too!"
5.0,Awesome wig! We got so many compliments.

5.0,"After my Scully leather agenda book--containing not only credit, insurance and Medicare cards, but also personal information and future appointments -- was pick pocketed from a large, open style LV shopping bag last month, I needed a safer way to carry important items into a store. After replacing my 6 ring zipper agenda, credit and insurance cards and drivers license, I searched Amazon for the perfect mid sized crossover bag -- one that would hold my new agenda book, reading glasses in hard case, keys, Kleenex and<br />iPhone 6sp while cruising Wal Mart and grocery isles -- and still fit into my LV shopping bag (now left in my car before entering a store). Finding no leather bags of the suitabable size, I settled on this bag. I received the shipment early and have been using it for many weeks now. Couldn't be more pleased. Color is as depicted. Bag is well constructed. Exterior pockets are well designed and the exterior zipper compartment holds my iPhone6SP perfectly. Either of the two large interior compartments holds my 5.75&quot; x 8&quot; x 1.75&quot; agenda book as expected. As a unexpected bonus, there is also ample room for coupons, pens, note pad, loose change, meds, must have make up and more. Comfortable, adjustable cross body strap. Completely forgot it was not genuine leather. Excellent value. Highly recommend."
5.0,Good for the price and comfortable.
5.0,Worked with sellers for a special request with the bags which was very professional and prompt. Highly recommend.
5.0,These are the best!! Sorry we cant get additional colors in my size XL30

5.0,Definitely want more. Wish they had more color options
5.0,Really cute and my son loves them. Happy with my purchase
5.0,The fit and feel of this shirt is wonderful! It‚Äôs lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,We were disappointed that we had to send it back because it was too small. (Our issue not the sellers sizing) The quality of the jacket was AMAZING! The picture they have for the product doesn't do it justice.
5.0,I new the suit would be too long because he is only 13 years old ... other than that the suit fit perfect.
5.0,Classic!<br />Just a subtle amount of color!<br />Great quality. It‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs new favorite belt. It looks fantastic with any color combination.<br />A great value for the price.
5.0,"Trying to find something that's not too bulky for my daith or rook has been a challenge, especially something with detail that's not plain. I normally wear black but it's nice to have options. This went in with no problems, clicked and stayed in place. Seems to be good quality. Since I don't have metal sensitivities (other than sterling silver) I don't know how it could affect others."
5.0,Muy Bonita
5.0,I ordered an XL and it fits true to size. I am super pleased with this product. It's flattering in all the right places! Its super comfortable and light enough to be worn in spring/summer but I will totally wear it in the winter as well with some leggings and boots. Oh and POCKETS.
5.0,It looks amazing
5.0,I bought a pair of these replacement lenses after I scracthed the original Oakley lensens. They are as good as the originals and only cost at one fifth of the okaley lenses. I ended up buying extra two pairs just in case I scratch these ones two.
5.0,"For years I have had to switch from polarized sunglasses to ""readers"" while fishing, a clumsy process, at best.  I now leave those ""readers"" in the tackle box (just in case!) but these bifocal reader sunglasses from Coyote are now by standard attire while on the water."
5.0,Beautiful details & well made.
5.0,My husband loved this!  Nice hat for the price.
5.0,My wife loves them. Exactly like the picture
5.0,Delicate and very pretty and I love how the claps works. It feels very secure.

5.0,i bought this crewneck sweatshirt for my husband.  he looks great in it.  smooth transaction thru amazon as usual.  thank you.
5.0,I love this dress.  I have been wearing it in the summer and in the fall.  It‚Äôs very pretty and you can‚Äôt beat the price.
5.0,Husband wanted this for his game room. Is perfect height for his pinball machine.  Nice quality.  Easy to assemble.  Is sturdy for big and tall sized individuals.  Would purchase again.
5.0,"I bought this for my 2.5 yr old and she loves it. Its perfect for colder days especially in Chicago. My main reason for buying it was for Halloween since here we never know what weather we will have. Its thick and feels like being inside a blanket. Def worth the money. You can also find it on the Disney website for the same price. I ordered a size 4t which is actually big on her but i wanted her to be able to wear it more then once and to last her a little longer. Her usual size for things like this would be a 3t. Even then it would be loose fit which again is good bcuz she would wear clothes underneath. So for us it works. Quality is good, shipping was fast, size works, overall great find on amazon. It also has a zipper and comes with the actual Disney store tags like buying it from them."
5.0,"My husband loves this ring! We had previously ordered a matching white gold channel set diamond ring set from a different company for our wedding two months ago. They did not have the rings ready on time, and they gave us plain white gold loaner rings. My husband's ring quickly scratched from weightlifting, but he liked the simple white gold look. When his real ring came which was nearly $600, it was terrible, the ring was rough and sharp, it was not a perfect circle, and the baguette diamonds were crooked, oblong triangles and looked awful. So we demanded our money back and returned it right away. We spent over a month looking for the right ring, and we decided he needed tungsten for the scratch resistance but spent hours contemplating over colored tungsten bands, but nothing seemed right. He kept saying how he wanted his plain loaner band and soon I realized that Tungsten comes in this white that looks just like white gold. When it arrived in the mail my husband was thoroughly impressed, the engraving was very big and visible and when it went on it was so smooth that my husband said it felt like a &#34;baby's bottom.&#34; Soon after he got his ring, he went to the gym, and it still looks flawless with no scratches! I'm amazed by the look, feel quality and engraving for such a low price. It looks like a proper wedding band and not cheap at all. It just goes to show that expensive isn't always better."
5.0,This Wool Buff has saved me through out the winter
5.0,"Replaced my worn out and broken doordash bag. Plus use for my own groceries when buying cold or frozen and it is extra hot or I have another stop before house. Handles are a little long, but that was easily solved with sewing machine. Rather have long and be able to shorten than too short."

The prices is much better than what you would expect to pay at the ballpark.<br />After purchasing this hat for myself i purchased another for my sister to take on deployment. This product makes a great gift as you can adjust the back of the hat to fit any head size.
5.0,I'm writing this review after 2 years of wearing.  The material is too good.. I'm still using this.  Looks elegant and fits well.
5.0,I got tired of regular sunglasses! So much glare and distortion I just didn't want to wear them. I want to protect my eyes with something I want to wear. I just got my pair and love them already! Great price and I'm so happy! I will wear these for my commute every sunny day!
5.0,It‚Äôs cute and practical. I got two different patterns in this style. This will be my stationery pouch on the go for sure. Great quality. Always love Hobonichi!
5.0,"Love them, very comfortable and don't hurt my feet.  Will by again."
5.0,This is the style of Jean I wear.
5.0,"I got this strap for my Seiko SNK809 field watch which is loosely based on a WWII German B-Uhr Flieger watch. Pilot straps should have a few things: stitching (especially white), rivets, and genuine leather. I also own a 55mm A-Uhr WWII-style Flieger Watch which came with a pseudo-pilot strap with rivets and was labeled &#34;genuine leather&#34; but some flaking and damage to the upper-layer revealed a rubbery substance underneath. Dishonest and unacceptable.<br /><br />This strap on the other hand, has all the requisite elements for a pilot's watch band and is sturdy with a fine grain of truly genuine leather. I recommend it.<br /><br />N.B. In the picture, this strap is on the watch that is farthest to the left."
5.0,"This is a fantastic Mirabel costume. It isn‚Äôt identical to the animated version but there is no doubt what this dress is. There‚Äôs so much attention to detail, even on the back. There are scalloped sleeves and collar and a pearly button clasp. The bag has the bright ribbon woven through it. The material feels great to the touch and it hides wrinkles well. The stitching is perfect. It‚Äôs true to size. It‚Äôs absolutely what I hoped it would be for my adorable niece who loves Encanto! The only thing missing is a pair of glasses!"
5.0,These are great. Love these shorts...lightweight..quick dry..super cool
5.0,awesome addition to my bracelet :)
5.0,"Love love love this shirt. I got one years ago, still have it, but felt like I wanted a &#34;backup&#34; shirt for if and when my original wears out (but it's held up remarkably well so far)."
5.0,My 5 yo loves these!!! She tries to sleep in them! Easy to put on but can be tricky for the child at first until shown.
5.0,Awesome christmas socks
5.0,This was a great necklace with lots of detail I got many compliments when I wore it. I would buy product from this seller again.
5.0,So cute and is a nice cut.
5.0,"This watch is very nice, as it is high quality, looks nice, has many features, and even lights up. This watch was a bit big for me, but thats my style.<br />It is completely worth the $80. It is also water resistant! Once you get the hang of how to utilize each of the watch's functions, this watch is very handy. If you like the look in the pictures, you wont be disappointed in your purchase. The watch came in a very nice box.<br /><br />Remember to measure and understand the watch specifications:<br /> -Net weight 231g<br /> -Case diameter 51mm<br /> -Case thickness: 15mm"
5.0,"Absolutely best watch bands! Durable, comfortable and really great colors."
5.0,Love the stretch watch band. Looks great with the Apple watch.<br />Shipping was fast
5.0,Very nicely made.  Design is on both sides.  Highly recommend.
5.0,La talla quedo bien
5.0,The tie and pocket square were nice.  It also included cuff links and although we did not use it was nice suprise.
5.0,"Out of the leggings I bought if this brand, these fit the best. I run a lot of miles and I don't find myself having to pull them up. They fit well and look cool! Surprisingly I have run faster in these leggings than any that I have, maybe they are aerodynamic. Lol"
5.0,I was concerned that these earrings were too big but they are just right!  They have a 3-D quality (they are not flat) which makes them look good from the side; this is important because my ear lobes lie flat against my head and I'm always seeing my earrings from the side.  I bought these earrings to go with a necklace and pendant (Black Spinel!) and the silver on these earrings really makes them stand out.  Very happy with this purchase!
5.0,"No necesito un reloj que me mande mensajes y notificaciones necesito un reloj que de la horaaa! Para m√≠ estos CASIO est√°n perfectos.<br /><br />Aprueba de agua.<br />Hora, minutos y segundos.<br />Alarma.<br />Luz de visi√≥n nocturna.<br /><br />UPDATED: la correa como era de esperarse se puso amarrilla y sin querer le di un golpe y se craqueo un poco pero sigue funcional!."
5.0,Great fit and soft material
5.0,"Great shirt for the price,I've bought 3. Great golf shirt."
5.0,Most comfortable compression sock I have ever worn.
5.0,"5'7, 122 lbs 34A. Fits perfectly. I find a lot of the time small top will fit me but the bottoms are never right. Too and bottom fit perfectly. Really cute look and seems well made."
5.0,"First of all, I was pleased to see this shirt came in 2 weeks earlier than it was estimated to.<br />When I ordered this shirt I already knew I would be tampering with the pockets based on the other reviews.<br />It's also slightly larger than what I expected which I don't mind.<br />I ordered a large and I'm 5'4 and this shirt is even longer on me than it is on the model.<br />Other than the pockets adding bulk to the hips, this shirt is super cute and the graphic looks great."
5.0,They are just what I needed
5.0,"Fit perfectly, I ordered a 8. Me having a big head is kind of hard to find hats anymore so I had to order one."
5.0,Basically what you expect to get.

5.0,Love that they are washable... good quality for the $
5.0,"Attractive watch. Nice weight to it. Keeps good time, have not had to adjust since I received the watch. Gets compliments from people who are always asking me what time it is."
5.0,"I gave this to my sister for her birthday. Its perfect for her, since she needed a sturdy pack to put in her briefcase. Its a nice fabrice and a small size."
5.0,Want sure about this at first got it for my son..but he really likes it. He says the neck warmer is great and works better than a scarf does. Hat is warm. Glad we got it for him!
5.0,I love this non medical mask. It is soft and breathable and easily used. I will buy more!
5.0,I bought for a gift for my daughter. Only took it out of the package to try and see quality. Loved it after just handling it for a few minutes. Hopefully my daughter does as much or it will quickly become mine!
5.0,"It fits me perfectly! I ordered medium, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and 165 pounds"
5.0,Good value for the money. Quality nice.
5.0,"My style is modern, and classy, with a little bit of edge. This bag was perfect for me! I purchased it for a work bag (I'm a nurse), and it is big enough to fit all of my stuff, wallet, book, makeup bag, pencil bag, stethoscope, and keys, without looking or feeling overstuffed. I can even toss my empty coffee cup in there at the end of the day with no problems, and I have gotten so many compliments on it!"
5.0,"love it! Good fit, very comfortable, like the color. Happy I purchased this item."
5.0,"I LOVE this suit! Supports on top, covers the belly without looking like a grandma mumu (I'm 36,) and the shorts provide great stylish coverage. Don't have to worry about bending over or constantly picking a wedgie!"
5.0,This necklace is darling...and so sparkling.  I love it!
5.0,"I bought these for my son who is on the autism spectrum.  He has a lot of sensory problems so he hates regular pants.  He usually wears leggings,  but these are more appropriate for summer time.  They are super comfortable and give him the compression he needs.  The higher waist line is more flattering and stays in place better."
5.0,"Wore it to an outdoor wedding in the summer and it took me more than 40 minutes before it got too hot to wear anymore, solid achievement in middle Georgia. Looks nice, wears well, gives just enough space so you can show off cufflinks too if you'd like."
5.0,"Very nice handbag, I love the style and the size.  You can even use the smaller handbag by itself--it serves a purpose as well.  A good purchase."
5.0,"Nice little loupe, great magnification, cant beat the price."
5.0,It‚Äôs my new favorite shirt. I love how it fits.
5.0,Will be wearing it out this year when the summer weather kicks in.
5.0,Great bag. Just what I needed.
5.0,Small but holds so much!!
5.0,"Ordered these for my mom, and she loves them. She just thought the backs came up a little higher, but none-the-less, she likes them. THANKS!"
5.0,Great it came earlier
5.0,These shirts are the best for workouts!  The sizing is accurate.  Very durable.  I've ordered almost every color available.
5.0,Very high quality.
5.0,"I bought  these for my granddaughter ,<br />She loved them !! And the colors  were<br />Perfect  they went great with all her shorts and capris. Really great value & fit."
5.0,"At first I thought these looked too bulky and my son wouldn't want to wear them - but they are very comfy inside and he loves them.  As they have been worn more, the fabric has relaxed and they look more like normal jeans.  My son asked for more pairs.  These are great for kids who like to be outside in cold weather, or who just don't like to be cold."
5.0,"My new favorite for NC summer shows. Very cool, not too see though (but do wear a nude bra) and washes well. I sweat quite a bit, but the shirt doesn‚Äôt feel too wet, and removing my coat in between classes gives everything a chance to dry out some before the next. I have a wide shoulders and a decent bust, and the fit is great for me- not too tight. I suspect that some may find the fit a bit boxy though, as it‚Äôs not cut to be super fitted. I prefer it that way, so I‚Äôm happy."
5.0,I'm very satisfied with my purchased.
5.0,"Bought a size medium. Fit perfectly. Love the colors, washed beautifully and glad I got it."
5.0,Sturdy buy dainty chain. I wanted a great chain for a charm I bought and this is just perfect. It is strong yet still dainty and the price was just right.
5.0,"Purchased my second one since the first one I bought was damaged after my son dropped my phone :( I know it's not the perfect case to protect it from falls but I love the little cat & sakura blossoms so I don't care! It's light, flexible, and not bulky so I'm happy with it."
5.0,Fit comfortably. Loved the look perfect for work outs.
5.0,Very pretty and well worth the cost
5.0,"I love these pants! They are very comfortable, with a hidden elasticized waistband. They are stretchy, but still retain their shape after wearing. If they made more colors, I would buy one of each!"
5.0,Cute and easy little black dress. Above average quality and material is a nice weight. I wore this for a birthday cocktail party and got lots of compliments. I have washed it but hung to dry and light iron and the shape is great!
5.0,"I have a bunch of these now. I get a compliment each time I wear one. Plus, they are super breathable, and my child and others can understand me when I talk. I just wish they made child sizes, because it's hard to understand my child speaking through a cotton mask.<br /><br />I also like that, when I'm not using it as a mask, I can just put leave it around my neck, and it's not ugly."
5.0,Still like the umbrella.  But dislike the mistaken part.  Supposed it should stand under sunshine instead lays under my roof.  Will make a feedback after get the replacement.<br /><br />1. Got replacement after contacted Wikiwiki within one week.  2. Got a sincere email and good offer from Wikiwiki and Amazon.
5.0,I like the band but it broke. The tiny part that holds it on the watch.
5.0,"Ordering this wallet was one of the best choices I have made. This wallet is clean, modern, and has all the essentials that I need in my EDC lineup. My back will be thanking me for years to come!"
5.0,"These leggings are super comfortable and fit me really well - I'm 5'3"" and 116 lbs and these do not bunch up in the wrong places nor are they constricting. These will look great with my fall and winter sweaters and boots!"
5.0,"This is a great product, wind and warm; in the cold winter, which wear a underwear and a shirt is enough"
5.0,Muy linda y abrigadora
5.0,Amazing look
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous dress! I wore it to an event and got so many compliments! The material is thick and great quality. Amazing dress for the price!

5.0,"delicate, cute and importantly unique.. must buy !!"
5.0,"Love these light-weight blazers that are perfect for Spring or Summer. This is my 3rd one (I have a grey, rose and maroon color) and I plan to get several other colors. I love them that much because you can dress them up for the office or down for a night out. However, they are made small so order a size or two up."

5.0,"Bought this shirt for my almost four year old, he loves it!"
5.0,"This hat is well made and fabric is soft, yet holds its shape. It is adjustable and has a liner to absorb sweat. The colors are great and when you put the hat on it feels very comfortable!  The hat is not too big in the front and doesn‚Äôt sag on the sides. It is a great hat!!!"
5.0,This blouse is soft and fits perfect. The order was shipped quickly too.
5.0,Great and cute!

5.0,Use for work very good quality and feels comfortable.
5.0,"UPDATE 8/9/17: Well, after about 4 months of using this every day, I have to say that this purse has exceeded all my expectations. Holding up great and still looks like brand new. I have gotten SO many compliments on it. Definitely going to be keeping this one around.<br /><br />Lovely purse! I would say it's comparable to Michael Kors, but at a fraction of the price. Love all the pockets, the color, the size (not too bulky, but big enough to hold everything I need for the day). It came a little bent from the way it was shipped, but I stuffed it full of books to give it structure and left it for a day--it straightened out just fine. I might buy it in another color as well!"
5.0,These were awesome for my niece when she was learning how walk.
5.0,"Purchased these as a gift for my husband, and he loves them! Thanks!"

5.0,My glasses fit the case just fin.
5.0,"This earring is absolutely amazing! I have an awkwardly placed cartilage piercing (thanks Claire‚Äôs) and this makes it look normal! I‚Äôve had this earring in (like I‚Äôve never taken it out once) for well over a year now, and I haven‚Äôt had a single issue. The diamonds are all still in tact, and the metal has remained shiny. I would honestly compare this to some of my other piercing jewelry that I paid an arm and a leg for at the tattoo shop. Additionally, it never stained my skin or left any irritation in my piercing! Usually with earrings you either get a good deal or you get good jewelry, but with this earring I was lucky enough to get both!!"
5.0,"I've had this purse for quite some time now, almost a year, and it was worth every penny! It still looks as good as the day I got it."
5.0,Perfect bag
5.0,The added cushion does help with foot pain

5.0,Now I wanna get more üëçüèª
5.0,"It‚Äôs definitely a great buy for the price! I got it as a gift to my kids‚Äô godmother... I got her initials on one side, & their names with godmom on the other... she loves it."
5.0,"This luggage tag is so cute, and seems very durable.  I've taken it on several trips so far.  I love the color."
5.0,I love this top!! I bought this and I am 7 months pregnant. It actually had enough room without stretching. I plan on wearing post baby so that it will be a little longer  I am 5‚Äô2 and purchased a medium
5.0,Great quality at good price.
5.0,Nice quality and as described but beware the size they say is WAY OFF. The outfit is somewhat wide and wayyy to big. I returned it unfortunately. I bout 0-3 and when i put it up to my 6-9 month clothes it was still bigger!
5.0,"I'm work in Lawenforcement. This cloth works great on my badge and name tag. Gets rid of the tarnish and shines them up really nice, like new and inspection ready. Works on silver and gold colors."

5.0,These are the best glasses for working in warehouse/production and ULINE certified
5.0,My kids love these.
5.0,"I must admit it was the price that initially got me, and didn't really care much for the design. I only needed a huggie I can wear to work. When this arrived, my son took the blue and black ones, while I kept the gold and silver ones for myself. They looked really great. The perfect size for someone who has midlobe piercings. And it clicks! You can actually hear when it locks; so I know it won't be falling off my ears. They're not as shiny as other jewelry but that's how I like it, kind of a matte shine, if such exists. I've worn the gold ones a couple of days, and have gotten a few compliments at work. We will see how they hold up to daily wear and then I will update my review."
5.0,Warm and comfortable the gloves and hat have a extra lining . On the gloves the extra lining is around the fingers and the hat is at the crown of your head . They are thick but not so thick that you can use your fingers. They are warm . Worth getting .
5.0,"Finding a plus size swim suit that actually flatters and fits comfortable is a bit of a pain for some of us that have all of our weight in the tummy area. For me my other parts are normal sized but my tummy has always been a huge issue so I've never been able to truely find a cute suite for summer. Until I came across this cute piece.<br /><br />-The swim suit material is super thick and durable in comparison to other value or online ordered suites I've tried. All stitching was where it should be and everything free of defect.<br /><br />-The top is a one piece number that is a muscle tank mixed with a Speghetti strap/Cami top all in one. It's not only flattering but it securley holds up top and around the waist. The top part has built in thin but just enough, cup inserts to keep nipples from showing through. And finally on the sides of the top it has cute little scrunching sides with tankini style strings.<br /><br />-The skirt has something I really appreciated being plus size and that's a thick band on the top that gives more tummy control and a better fit. I did not have my tummy going up and over the band like with other two piece numbers. The skirt is plenty long and has the built in undergarment system. The skirt being long on top, tucks under the top piece so I can raise my hands up high and no one is seeing my tummy.<br /><br />-Lastly this adorable swimsuit came with a handmade multicolored bead necklace. Just a cute little bonus to the already great buy that I received.<br /><br />Overall this swimsuit is the perfect swimsuit for a plus size gal or any size woman for that matter who wants something that is cute and attractive by covers and holds in all of the right places. The suite washed well on low in the machine and air dried. The material is super thick with great stitching so I expect it to last me.<br /><br />I did receive this swimsuit at a discounted price in exchage for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the product after using it."
5.0,Material is thin but it's still cute and I think my girlfriend will love it
5.0,love it so soft and comfy

5.0,Omg this dress is seriously so dang cute! It‚Äôs the perfect length and very flattering and many body types. I‚Äôm 120 lbs and 5‚Äô6 and ordered a size small!
5.0,I am very happy with this toe ring.  It is not only beautiful but also nice quality!!!!  I have worn it everyday since purchasing it!!!  The design is so pretty and the details show up so u dont have to look up close to see.  Which is nice considering it is worn way down on the toes!!! haha
5.0,The fit was as stated. Super comfy. I sleep in them!
5.0,"The three pack is a great deal. Fit is great. I wore one on a run recently. It‚Äôs my favorite new running shirt. The hood is a good bonus. I just use it for sweat post run. It‚Äôs thin, so it‚Äôs for indoor workouts or good weather."

5.0,"This is much nicer than I even imagined! it is a heavy material that drapes so beautifully. The sleeves are my favorite and it is so comfortable! It's pretty true to size as it is supposed to be a little roomy, but I do think I could've gotten away with a size smaller. I recommend this blouse!"
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and weigh 135. I ordered a medium and it fits just right. Very comfortable.
5.0,The material is flowy and soft
5.0,"It's actually a gift for a ten year old boy in France who loves Real Salt Lake, and I haven't given it to him yet, but it seems very well made and it looks like it will hold up for him until he changes team loyalty!"
5.0,Love it cutest jack O lantern perfect size to.
5.0,SO CUTE!!!!!
5.0,"The material is comfortable and washes well. It is a cute design, I've got a soft spot for fictional gift shop items."
5.0,It's very good comfortable skirt.
5.0,Very cute! One size fits most. 6 year old loved it for her birthday party
5.0,Super soft and comfy!!! My daughter wants to wear it and only it all the time. I need to order ten just like it
5.0,"Great thermals for kids. Buy these, seriously skip the flimsy cheap stuff they have at Walmart. These have meat on their bones and will do the trick of insulating and keeping them warm. Will buy these from now on, they are good quality and affordable."
5.0,My only complaint is that even if you wash in cold and hang dry it shrinks just a little but not enough to make it uncomfortable. Beautiful top lots of compliments on it!
5.0,SUPER cute. And well made. Feels very light weight and will be perfect for a summer day. I think I will pair it with sandals or wedges and a sun hat.
5.0,"I thought the belt could have been better. It's a black stretchy sash. The gloves are like under the sink gloves too. But the goggles, wig, and jacket are the real show stealers."
5.0,"This wrap is absolutely beautiful. The color was accurate to the photos. The size is surprisingly large, it often seems like most items ordered online are smaller than they seem, but not this one (The measurements are accurate). Everything about this item was quality. From the heavy plastic bag it came in, the cording instead of plastic holding the tags on, the reusable gift bag included, the small free gift thrown in (mine was a beautiful beaded bracelet) to the actual wrap itself. The beautiful lacing around the edge is stretch and the whole wrap, including the lace, is snuggly soft. I look forward to using this accessory often. It is great for dressing up or casual. Again, not only is the wrap beautiful and quality but the whole presentation is one of quality. I am quite impressed that the company took the the initiative to make every aspect speak to the quality of their products. LOVE IT!<br />*I received this item at a discount for my review. It is against Amazon's policy to &#34;buy&#34; good reviews however and any seller attempting to bribe for stars can be removed from Amazon. Take comfort in that my integrity and my love of Amazon will not allow me to post a dishonest review. After all, I shop here too and rely on others honest reviews when I myself am purchasing items. Therefore I strive to make MY reviews an honest and clear assessment of the products."
5.0,"I've had sensitive eyes for as long as I can remember mostly due to glare. When I am indoors the white walls and LED lighting really affects my acuity. These sunglasses are the best at reducing glare. It's surprising how cheap these glasses are but how well built they are. If you are scared of breaking them, what I am notorious for, the glasses come with a hard case. I keep it in my car and it's always there for me when I need it. I also like how light the glasses are. They do not feel heavy and I can wear them for long durations."
5.0,Nice art details.
5.0,Looking for some gloves that are not thin and can handle the work that I do. These came out great! I bought a size medium and it's not too loose when I wear them. Doesn't feel cheap. Will buy more!
5.0,Recieved this shirt fast and I am happy with the quality. The tags tear out easily so no problem with itchy tags

5.0,Bought these for my son for the start of the scool year. His school requires almost all black sneakers. Also bought a pair of Asics as well which were much more. I like the look and the detail/styling of the Under Armour so much more but cannot comment yet on the durability as it has only been 3 weeks.
5.0,"I use these for daily wear at work.  Comfortable fit, legs feel good."

5.0,Very cute. My granddaughter looked really pretty.
5.0,Best
5.0,"I like that the fabric is soft and they have great coverage over the important areas. My daughter used them the first night she received them  and in the morning she was all smiles, no more leaks or ruined sheets. She feel much better about starting school with the extra protection since she‚Äôs pretty new at this. They do run small, I‚Äôm glad I read the reviews before I ordered!!!! My daughter is about 116lbs, so I ordered her a XXL. You can also wash them with your regular clothes and dry them normally, I have done this once. I do prefer the hand wash cycle and less dry setting just because I think this way will be better on the material. I hope this helps whoever read."
5.0,I love that it‚Äôs baggy to pull off the look I want. I get so many compliments. I really need to order more. I love this sweater!
5.0,This vest is perfect for those who work in the elements! Not too hot where it would be uncomfortable but cuts the chill for sure! Battery lasts a full work day if not more and the sizing was spot on. It works best when snug!
5.0,This was bought for my young son. He is know for scuffing his shoes up and these have held up with no scuffs so far! Well made and stiff material so as not to loose it‚Äôs strong  heel for quick put on.
5.0,"I LOVE this purse. Lux de Ville always makes cute, high quality bags and this one doesn't disappoint. The pattern is so cute and it's built to last."
5.0,"I was not sure about these Socks, I was looking for a good Merino Wool hiking Sock I know there a Snowboard Sock but gave them a try I really like the Socks I have big calves and Socks tend to slide down and bunch up I don't like that,, it's uncomfortable, if your out all day hiking or climbing, I will stay sun up to sun down  most times, anyway the Sock:  this pair has a really nice feel on the skin, does not pull the hair on my calves and my feet tend to swell when i'm out all day and that also becomes uncomfortable but with these compression Socks I don't have that problem and I have better circulation which keeps me moving longer. They go over the calve and then some they say up all day. There not to hot or to cold just right. I'm really happy with these Socks I highly recommend you give them a try. Winter has not really hit here in Utah yet so I will have to see how they are  in cold climate conditions in my Muck's that will be another review. OH!! please when you wash them,  wash in cold gentle cycle hang to dry they will last you much longer. I have worn Merino Wool summer and winter for years these are GREAT!!!"
5.0,Made a nice bow. Was easy to adjust for larger neck.
5.0,"They fit true to size for me,great product."
5.0,Cool shirt that fits great!
5.0,"this bag is perfect for carrying just the essentials for a trip to the gym or field. I didn't find the shoe compartment super useful, as it takes up space in the main bag; however, it is still just right for 1-2 items, shoes and a water bottle."
5.0,Comfortable and very pretty.
5.0,Super soft. I get lots of compliments on this top.
5.0,For my husband who loves them.

5.0,"This is so beautiful! I'm going to wear it all summer! I  am 5'1 , 38B, size 30 pants and weight 150lbs. I normally order a medium but went with large because of reviews<br />..... I'm sure the medium would ha e fit me just fone but the large fit perfectly. It didn't squeeze to tight anywhere and made me feel sexy! 100% recommend"
5.0,A High School Memorable!!
5.0,"The dress is very nice quality for the price. The material, even after being shipped in a plastic envelope, was relatively wrinkle free. Very attractive appearance. Fits okay....but would like it just a tad looser. I am 5' 5&#34;. About 144 lbs. The large will definitely be too big. The length is perfect. I will enjoy this dress anyway because it is such a great value."
5.0,Very beautuful!!
5.0,I like the way it fits and i like the side pockets.
5.0,Love this bag!!!!!! I know I paid too much for this but I really wanted this. I love the gold color.

5.0,"Very nice watchband.  Looks like it will wear very well, unlike the last one I purchased (another brand/company).  Especially appreciate the insertion tool and extra pins.  I would have had difficulty installing it without the tool."
5.0,"I love these panties - they go through the wash well, and are therefore durable, they look fabulous, and they look practically invisible under clothes. Additionally, I selected the colors, black, nude, and white, which are very neutral, and benefit many different color schemes/outfits. What more could you ask for?"

5.0,These are great glasses. Much better than Raybans and the like.
5.0,"I have been using this bike shorts with my stationary bike. It does the job of keeping me comfortable while spinning. I give it a 4 in thickness since the padding is thinner, if I compare with a Pearl Izumi. But for the price, I am happy with my purchase. I will be buying again."

5.0,"The neck closure is nice because it doesn't get too tight, yet keeps the hair from going down the back.  Hair slides right off - easy to clean. And the window is nice because my son can look at his phone while I cut his hair; makes for a more peaceful haircut for the both of us"
5.0,Muy feliz con mis botas gracias üôèAmazon
5.0,Very Nice! Just what I was expecting!!!

5.0,"I bought this backpack for a trip and I loved everything about the backpack. Look in the listing pictures and read the descriptions. It came with all that it states and is actually thick. I didn't have a good trip and I'll never go back there again, but this backpack came in handy and kept my things together during walks. The width of the straps are too thin, but the straps itself were long so they extended enough to become comfortable for me. I was able to wash it after using it on my trip and it didn't get damaged or lose its color. I love the color!!! Thank you."
5.0,For me this bag is great since I was only looking to carry a laptop small note book and some documents. It is not a big bag at all and won‚Äôt fit most larger laptops. Great for traveling with on plans and long trips. There are many pockets for smaller items like chargers.

It‚Äôs hard to find this kind of camo for cheap and fits great! I was scared about the sizing looking at other views... I am 5-10, 260 (athletic/bodybuilding) and it is perfect at 2XL.

5.0,"My favorite masks . But needs to be washed by hand per the wire inside. Doesn‚Äôt make my face tingle at the end of day like other masks so I love it. I just ordered 6 more of these last month with the increase of delta variant. The new masks fit a bit more snugly than the old ones, so there is a bit of maneuvering around the ears. Still, for the price of $5.95 per mask the fit and ease, these are my go-to. Can wear without smothering and sweating all over the place. Plus, they look sleek and sexy on the face."
5.0,My 7 yr old only wears these disposable masks. She doesn‚Äôt like cloth ones. I have bought these 3 or 4 times already. Would recommend. They fit well.
5.0,"Son muy ligeras y muy c√≥modas ,es perfecto"

5.0,"[[ASIN:B06XGBCFX3 Outus 3 Pack Heavy-duty Key Chain Key Reels Retractable Key Holder with 27.5 Inch Thick Nylon Cord and Key Ring]]<br /><br />This 3-Pack of Key Chain Key Reels work well! I have had these for two or so months now. I purchased them in conjunction with [[ASIN:B01LX5P6PL MIFFLIN ID Card Holder (10 Pack), Clear Plastic Badge Holder, Resealable, Waterproof, Vertical Style]] to hold a homemade name tag for my son's library card and bike lock key. I clip it on to the included key strap in the small front pocket of his backpack.<br /><br />My Boyfriend also liked it and asked if he could have one of the extras and now he uses it to hold his work ID card/key."

5.0,"Excelente muy comodo,facil de pones y quitar de la mu√±eca"
5.0,Absolutely LOVE this choker<br /> Wear it a lot!
5.0,"I ordered this kaftan as a swim suit cover up, but you could wear it on a summer's day or evening as an ethnic style casual dress. It is comfortable, stylish and vibrant, and I like the Rayon fabric. Rayon is man made from wood-pulp, but breathes, feels smooth, is cool to wear and drapes really well. The only down side is Rayon does crease, so needs the occasional iron. Much better fabric than Polyester.<br />I am delighted with it, for the price, as it fits in a relaxed way, and my hips are 52""! Even so, there is room to loosen it if required, about 2"" extra fabric at the hip level. I ordered a large size, and when it arrived there was no size label, but the bag said ""One Size"" and described the colour as Green. It is actually turquoise (mid way between green and blue). The length is down to the top of my shoes, and I am 5Ft 5""tall.<br />I immediately looked it up again on Amazon, but guess what - no more! It must have flown off the shelves."
5.0,The top is too small & the skirt is too long for my 3 yr old.
5.0,Good quality for a good price.

5.0,This pin is so cute and the quality is great
5.0,Love it thank u
5.0,"My kids teacher‚Äôs loved these!  Very simple, pretty, and we thought they would get more use out of them."
5.0,"I am 6ft and wear a size 14 clothes and these actually fit great. When I put them on, they went up about 4 inches past my knee, which is higher than I thought they would. The patterns aren't as vibrant in the picture, but they are great for a queen of hearts halloween costume."
5.0,The sizing is perfect and top fits very nice. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 weigh 145lb and ordered a large love the fit.
5.0,These saved me during a week doing relief work in Puerto Rico. Absolutely worth it.
5.0,It‚Äôs summer time and I‚Äôve been traveling a lot. I usually wear jeans but I have been loving wearing dresses and skirts. The material is soft and light. It‚Äôs perfect for packing just a carryon since it‚Äôs thin and lightweight. The design is so pretty and the ruffles in the sleeves and body gives it a fun flirty accent. It‚Äôs a little short so I wear it with bike shorts. The large is perfect I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 145lbs. so it was nice and flowy. What a bargain for summer dress! The design and pattern is great you can dress it up with wearing heels or dress down and wear sneakers! Love this dress!

5.0,This royal blue is so pretty and the top itself is cute.
5.0,"What can I say about this watch that it hasn't been said.<br /><br />It truly withstands the test of time. Bought in 2014 and it still going strong in 2022, I have not even had to change the battery.<br />I been mountain biking, swimming, kayaking, the beach. Whatever you throw at it it still works.<br /><br />The strap will fall apart every year or two years, but mostly depends if it gets caught on something.<br /><br />I wish everything was as reliable, cheap and straightforward as this watch. In fact this cheap watch outlasted my garmin fenix2 watch, which was marketed as adventure watch.<br /><br />This is the toyota truck of watches. The only thing I don't like is the light which is dim ."
5.0,"May not be the same quality as Oakley?? but much, much cheaper. These were bought for my 15 yr old son and the primary use is baseball and the beach. The lens are very clear and have held up to the abuse and multiple drops for almost a year"
5.0,Great fit and color.
5.0,Lovely soft material. Really nice fitting. Perfect. Delivery was on time packaging was ok.
5.0,These fit nicely over my everyday glasses and look stylish to boot!
5.0,"I like the LCD display of the winded and the customization for the needs of different automatics. I will say that if your in an environment that is completely quiet, you will hear this functioning, albeit ever so slightly. For the price it‚Äôs a decent single watch winder."
5.0,"beautiful, modern, love it"
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the fabric of this dress. It‚Äôs not that cheap silk fabric that most sellers have. It‚Äôs quite warm and comfortable. There‚Äôs an elastic waist. In the picture, I‚Äôve added a belt to it. The dress was just not my style. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù4‚Äô and it was a tad too long for me so I‚Äôll be returning it, but if you‚Äôre looking for something long and conservative with pockets, this is for you! It would look great with a scarf and booties."
5.0,These shorts end right above the knee giving your quads some space to breath. Form fitting. Great workout shorts.
5.0,"Good quality, soft and well made, I just need to get a larger size."
5.0,"LOVE this dress.  I‚Äôm big busted and carry my weight in my mid-section, and this dress fit PERFECTLY!  I can‚Äôt remember the last time I was so complimented in a piece of clothing; every single time I wear it.  I‚Äôm a size 12 and I purchased the XL."

5.0,Fabulous dress! Super comfy and looks great! Excellent bargain!
5.0,"GREAT QUALITY, MORE THAN ENOUGH STORAGE,  IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A SMALL WALLET THIS ISN'T THE ONE FOR YOU, THIS IS VERY LARGE FOR A WALLET IT WONT FALL OUT OF YOUR POCKET, IF YOU DON'T CARRY A LOT IN YOUR WALLET EVEN BEING LARGE IT'S A GREAT QUALITY, WILL LAST A LIFETIME, MINE AT LEAST. LOTS OF HIDDEN POCKETS FOR STORAGE. GLAD I PURCHASED IT...."
5.0,"A very good imitation of the Pandora charm, I love it so much!!"
5.0,Great quality great skirt!!!
5.0,"Like many of the other &#34;reviewers&#34; my daughter has eczema. All night long she scratches at her hands until the bleed and she wakes up screaming. All. Night. Long. We got these sleeves in yesterday and she slept so well! She didn't even try to scratch! Also, the fabric didn't irritate her skin. For us, it works better if you put it ok under baby's clothes."

5.0,"I bought these for my 16 year old daughter.  She loves them.  They fit great (she is a size 7 and that is the size I purchased), she says they are super comfortable and all her friends complimented her on them."
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprized when this brooch arrived, as it is shinier and much more attractive than pictured."
5.0,They do exactly what I want them to do: allow me to reuse the 2.0 kcups.
5.0,"Great !!! Got product quickly , as described. VERY SATISFIED"
5.0,Easy to install and fit perfect on my daughters gizmo watch.
5.0,I have to use sleeveless shirt for lifting.  Love how these look and feel when working out.  Need to order a few more colors.
5.0,Fits as expected and is exactly as described. Buttons are sewn on poorly though so I did Have to re-sew one on that fell off and I reinforced the others. Besides that this shirt is super cute
5.0,I ordered a size up from what I‚Äôve ordered before just for a more relaxed fit and it‚Äôs a very comfortable shirt which reflects my everyday attitude

5.0,good bands
5.0,"I bought this beautifully, gothic dress on impulse. I have no place to wear it to. Maybe one day we will have concerts, conventions, fancy dinners, etc again.<br /><br /> I was not disappointed though. It is gorgeous.  It‚Äôs not exactly high quality fabric but it is great for the price. It will hold up well if taken care of. It fits me perfectly. I purchased a large. I am 5‚Äô6.5 125-130lb DD bust."
5.0,Beautiful color they were birthday gifts and individuals at received him a very happy
5.0,My bestie looked amazing in her wedding with those!
5.0,"I have used the same junky carabiner for many years to hold my keys, primarily to make quick removal easy. However, it's easy for rings to fall off accidentally since there is no lock. This keychain solved all of my problems.<br /><br />No more accidental removal of rings. The lock on this keychain is excellent. It's almost impossible to disengage on accident, and very easy to disengage on purpose.<br /><br />No more fumbling around in my pocket. The length of this chain allows me to easily hook to a belt loop for easy access.<br /><br />No more Chinese junk. This is made in Taiwan out of what appears to be much higher quality materials.<br /><br />Others have mentioned it is easy to end up with an unwieldy glob of keys, but there are easy solutions. Stagger the groups of keys by attaching a secondary ring to the provided ring, remove unused keys, or buy a different large ring that is actually intended to be used for a large number of keys.<br /><br />My only gripe would be the price. $20 seems pretty steep for a keychain. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />UPDATE 2019-09-12:<br /><br />I'm still using the same product I purchased years ago and it has held up wonderfully. I still love it and would buy it again.<br /><br />UPDATE 2021-10-25:<br /><br />The finish is a little scratched up but no rust and it still works perfectly. I even bought another one for my wife. This is the keychain I recommend to everyone who cares enough to ask."
5.0,"I ordered the white with gray stripe cardigan and love it.. I ordered a large but only needed a medium. I will be using it to layer over long sleeves so it will probably work but the sizing was my own fault. The length is great! I am 5'3"" and it hits me at my knees. Great price and great quality - will probably order another color just a little smaller."
5.0,Bought for granddaughter who was absolutely thrilled with it.
5.0,"Very cute! Only thing that would improve this is if his face or mouth was on the hat, but it was a hit at the baby shower. Very soft, cute, and came quickly."
5.0,Really nice material. Pretty stretchy but holds it shape will be buying more colors
5.0,Girls love it!
5.0,"If they came in more colors I would buy them all! I have a very large butt compared to my waist so when I buy leggings that fit my waist and height the backside becomes completely see through, not with these. Great fabric, slightly higher waisted (which I love), perfect fit all around. I ordered xl I am 5'4&#34; 150lbs 30&#34; waist 42&#34; hip/bottom"
5.0,We loved these pins. Well made.

5.0,Beautiful earrings and my daughter loved them. Easy to adjust the clips and just the right size
5.0,"This is an excellent silicone band! I was very sceptical at first since it's shipping from abroad, but to my surprise came in 6 days. You can't beat the price and the quality seams very nice too. Not a dust picker!! I purchased it for my Huawei smart watch and it fits perfectly. It also comes with quick release attachments!<br />I really like it and hope it last a good while but only time will tell. I will update this review of anything changes."

5.0,Beautiful dress!!! Looks just like the pic! Perfect for Summer!!
5.0,My daughter saved all her money for a few months to get this dress!  Its so adorable it fit great.  Arms were little tight cause of the stretchy material but otherwise great dress.
5.0,As expected and no defects! Great price too!
5.0,"This fit perfectly, nice quality, not too short or long.  Doesn't have the bulky look that a lot of skorts have."
5.0,Just what I was searching for. Great purchase !
5.0,very great form fitting dress - but not overly sexy.  love that it's still classy.
5.0,So neat

5.0,I don‚Äôt even need it but it‚Äôs so gorgeous I‚Äôm not returning it üòπüòπüòπüòπ
5.0,Very cute bracelet for only pennies.
5.0,Perfect product. Fast Shipping!
5.0,So cute and casual. Fits loosely but that‚Äôs how I wanted it to be!
5.0,Definitely too small for an 11 year old. But she still wears it.
5.0,This was a great gift for my husband.  He loves them and uses them every day in his shirt collars.  They are far better than the plastic ones.
5.0,"Package arrived on time. Dress is very comfortable, and it fits well too."
5.0,"I got this in XXL, because I'm a size 20-22, roughly 279lbs. The waistband is fully elastic and fits snugly but not uncomfortably around my waist. I am 5'4"" and it is a bit below ankle length, but doesn't drag on the ground.<br /><br />The fabric is sheer and smooth, and although it wrinkles easily, it looks to be good quality and is soft against the skin. It's voluminous and swooshy, which I really like.<br /><br />Plus, it has pockets! They are big enough to fit my cell phone and don't distort the silhouette of the skirt at all.<br /><br />Overall, this is very comfortable and well-made, and it looks great. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I received a complimentary sample of this in exchange for a fair review. For many years, I used a punch pin I made myself to knock out watchband pins. This device makes the process much easier and secure. One side pushes the pin out, and the other side pushes it in. I was very impressed by the workmanship of this. It is made of tool steel to excellent tolerances. It is a precision instrument. It comes with two extra pins. If you frequently have to adjust watchbands, this device will soon become your friend!"
5.0,"I like them. They fit pretty snuggly at first, but they break in very well"
5.0,First watch did not work but I happy with the second one
5.0,Fantastic Purchase

5.0,Material is cool enough for the Caribbean
5.0,I will order more stuff from you.
5.0,Exchanged for different color - same jacket -
5.0,"I live in downtown and need to keep my key handy while walking my dog. So I bought two lanyards of different colors. One is used to hang my key, and the other is used to hang my phone. But it‚Äôs so pretty and I get compliments on it all the time."

5.0,Really nice lanyard and keychain. Comes with a thick sticker of the fallout boy too.
5.0,Need XL instead of L
5.0,Fits true to size!
5.0,"I purchased this one as there was more expensive dresses out their with cactus print that was a little above my pay range for a novelty dress.<br /><br />This dress fit wonderfully! I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, around 170 pounds with a 34DD bust. Most items I have to alter a bit and this one fit well. I did add a white cami under it as well as white bike shorts - because duh it‚Äôs white. All white items are going to be see through.<br /><br />I did receive a ton of compliments and stood out at the party I attended, especially since I added a succulent to my hair.<br /><br />It‚Äôs a must buy!"
5.0,Super comfy. Perfect for working out.

5.0,"The reason I purchase the HeatherGem products was because I have twice over the last 10 years visited HeatherGems in Pitlochry, Scotland. The process of creating the HeatherGem jewelry is in itself fascinating and the end products are exquisite. Each creation is different."
5.0,Great weight and color
5.0,These earrings are beautiful! I wear them in both casual and formal settings and always get compliments.  They catch light and sparkle like real diamonds.  Pretty proud of this great purchase!
5.0,"Perfect size, perfect purse"
5.0,"Nothing to dislike.<br />I'm not sorry I ordered them. Fits good, and I'm getting used to the progressive lenses.<br />Absolutely recommend them. Silver hardware looks elegant. Hard case is an added bonus. Even a polishing cloth and ü™õ."

5.0,I bought these for my converse so they would be easy to slide on.  I want them for every pair of shoes now! I ordered the size 7-8.5 for my size 7 shoes and they were the perfect length. I loved how these look like regular shoelaces. You wouldn't know they are stretchy from just looking at them.
5.0,Love these. They came in sooner than expected and I have been lounging in them for the past couple of days. Very breathable fabric as well as enough to keep the chill off my legs when walking in the 40 degree weather.
5.0,Adorable and high quality feeling! I was shocked at how thick the material was and how awesome this dress feels. Pearls are individually sewn on. I wore for family Christmas and it was perfect! Found via IG blogger.
5.0,Very happy with company's s product and service. They are &#34;spot on&#34; with products.
5.0,I did a ton of research to find leggings on Amazon that were good for active wear and wearing out. I took a gamble and ordered these and they are perfect! Fit awesome and have tummy control as well as not see thordered am 5 ft 4 and 150 and I ordered a medium. Couldn't be happier. Well done Tesla.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:800b216e9887133b21801ae788f51cc3]] Sometimes, we buy clothes that flaunts our shape, though at times our very unsightly bra strap ruins the whole look. So instead of throwing away that untouched dress in your wardrobe, why not get a solution to your fashion disaster. Tadan!<br /><br />I know your time is of value so let me try to go directly straight to the point as i summarize my findings and experience with this cover:<br />1. Adhesiveness- i will be attaching a video showing how adhesive this cover is. And i know it could be scary that maybe you'll ask ‚Äúwhat if it falls off?‚Äù  well, i was worried about that too, so to test it, i did some exercises at home to sweat out, and to my surprise, they were still adhesive!<br /><br />2. Application-so basically, there's a plastic cover on the side that will be in contact with you, take it off, then cover your ‚Äúlovely parts‚Äù. What i want to do (and you could too!) is i start at the lower part, then i gently pull it upward to stick to the upper area. Creating a lifting effect. Rather than just splatting it on, so for me, starting at the bottom going up makes the form better.<br /><br />3. Does not leave lines on clothes. (see the photo.) okay. So for me, it could be unsightly to see indentions and bra lines in general. I wore my dress that usually easily gets lines to test this out. And wow! It's just free flowing!<br /><br />So overall i am completely satisfied with this product. Especially that i have an infinity dress that is often styled backless, this would really make wearing it hassle-free!<br /><br />Notes:<br />‚Ä¢remember, it is in your hands on how neat you are going to place it, if you just place it, there may be a tendecy that it wouldn't look free flowing on your clothes.<br />‚Ä¢clean clean clean! You want to wear this with clean skin, no oils, moisturizers, perfumes, or lotions. After wearing it, i would clean it with wet wipes, then i would air dry it then cover it with the pastic again to maintain it's adhesiveness.<br /><br />I hope i was able to help you in your decision making.<br /><br />You deserve the best! :)<br /><br />Stay awesome!"
5.0,"I love that this comes with the exact two sizes I needed. I have my cartilage stretched to a 2g, but it's very painful to put flares in it. I wanted a matching 2g and 0g set, and this fulfilled that. The fact that they are hollow inside allows for the earring to squish and be placed inside my cartilage piercing without pain. I will be buying these again if I can find them in black."
5.0,"Very pretty, soft n feminine.  I ordered 2 sizes bigger, because it comes from China. But I could have ordered my usual size, almost..maybe just 1 size bigger. I do like things loose"
5.0,".  At Christmas I gave him a book about the Indian Motorcycle, he and his father had a grand time looking at it.  This was a gift for my son-in-law.  He was very excited to receive the &#34;Indian Pin&#34;"
5.0,"Bought a few of these for my band's music video. Looked great as props in a mental hospital. Then I recycled them and now use them for my college science courses. The wrists are elastic and fit well, and also it has pockets and buttons."
5.0,Cheap boots but I LOVE them!!!! I want another pair I wear these all the time!!!!
5.0,Love this!  Super cute and molds/bends to proper size for my ear easily.

5.0,"Great phone purse.  I was looking for some that would go cross body  and was small enough to carry my phone and a few normal wallet items, that I could use at work and it would still keep track of my steps.  I saw something quite like this item at Game Stop near by, but it was a little different style.  As always I look on Amazon to see what I could find.  This little purse was so worth looking for and finding.  I use it as the cross body purse but I also use it to carry my phone and all of my wallet items, in my large purse.  I would purchase again."
5.0,"I wear this top all the time. It is comfortable, but still looks really cute. The color isn‚Äôt as vibrant as it is in the picture, but I still love it. I would buy it again."
5.0,I love this shirt. well worth the price. My son loved it and everyone complimented it!
5.0,"Fun shirt, good quality."
5.0,These little bands are great and the Seller is great to wrk with. Mine were too big so I messaged them & they sent out smaller ones fast at no cost. I‚Äôm using them to keep my engagement ring from turning -during the cold weather my finger shrinks lol. I‚Äôve had other brands in the past and these by far are the nicest.  I would recommend going down a size as they do stretch as you wear them.  I still may need a smaller size but I‚Äôm sure this seller will make it right. Don‚Äôt hesitate on these.
5.0,Very comfortable. Cute and colorful. Shipping was fast.
5.0,"The product is perfect...litter bit large, but it is ok, is useful! Thanks!"
5.0,i like the color and the the comfort.i was a little worried at first because the left shoe seemed tight but after wearing it for an hour or two it felt perfect
5.0,These are very versatile and excellent to wear under low cut or clothing that exposing too much skin.  Excellent purchase.
5.0,Fantastic gaming mouse pad
5.0,My two year old absolutely loves these. He has sensory issues due to being autistic and having these helps him so much! He grabs them and takes them everywhere and loves to just wear them!
5.0,"Very fast delivery,  item was exact to description, highly reccomended."
5.0,Love it.  Pendant is larger than expected but not too large.  Chain is a bit short.  Overall very pleased.
5.0,Came sooner than expected. The curved bar is a little shorter then the one I bought from the store but still fits and looks good.
5.0,So comfortable. Fits great. Washed nicely and no fading or color loss.
5.0,Just what my husband wanted for a his work watch.
5.0,"I recently lost some weight and was trying to find pieces for a new wardrobe. I saw this and took a chance and it is so soft, fits perfectly. Dusty blue is a favorite color. I am 5'7 and weigh about 155# with a 38D bust. this falls below the knee and I need to add a photo sometime, but I really like this dress. I worked with the seller about testing (as per the invite in the package) and they were polite, timely and professional."
5.0,"Size 3 fits like a charm! I have tiny fingers. Buying rings is next to impossible for me. I‚Äôve been in love with aquamarine/teal/turquoise colors these days. This matches my Apple Watch band too! You can go a half size down if your ring size is, for example, 5.5 or 6.5. That‚Äôs because these have a tiny bit of stretch. Highly recommend. Will be buying in other colors!"
5.0,wonderful product.  makes identifying ones luggage much easier
5.0,I love this belt! Great quality!
5.0,"Abosolutely love it! So comfortable, washes well and dries wrinkle free coming right out of the dryer. Doe's not see through so no layering needed. Will buy in other colors!"
5.0,It‚Äôs faceted and gives off a beautiful sparkle.  I have paired with my multi colored tourmaline bracelet which is also sown in this pic. The adjustable cord is strong and well done and beaded on the ends. I definitely recommend this!
5.0,"I love this shirt! Drapes so well and the fit is very flattering even if you have a tummy. It's not too sheer at all, even the white one is not see through. I love how the back comes down further than the front to cover well past your bottom. I'm ordering more colors right now!"
5.0,"This cute June tote came folded and in a ziploc bag.  There is a hard piece to fit in the bottom of the tote to help give the tote shape and stability.  Inside there is a wax-like coating and a smell zipper pocket.  The embroidery is well done, not a print.  This would make a great tote to take to the farmer‚Äôs market.  It also holds my 17 inch laptop, so could be a nice tote to carry books and your laptop to class or work.  The options are limitless!"
5.0,Love how the dress fits my body
5.0,I love it! My husband gives me so many compliments when I wear it!
5.0,For the price.... it's a good deal! Looks nice.... ordered in white and silver.

5.0,Love this hat!  I'm going through chemo and it fits my bald head perfectly and kreps me warm.  I get lots of compliments too.  Will be wearing this long after the cancer is gone and my hair grows back!!
5.0,I Am tall and was worried it would be to short but the cut is flattering. I got the white and it is just enough to throw on over a tank to cover my arms down to the elbow. Worth 10 bucks
5.0,"Beautiful bag! Big and roomy...I carry lots of stuff in my purse, including wallet, cosmetics bag, cell phone, earbuds, books, and sometimes my husband's and son's cell phones and sunglasses...this bag will hold it all!"
5.0,"Love the texture pattern on the pants.  I also work them to work under a big sweater and dressy flats.  Really cute.  Then went to yours after work!  I usually do not wear leggings or yoga pants to work but these worked. By the way, the ‚Äúmaroon‚Äù color turned out to be a dark mauve more in the darker blush pink side if that makes sense."
5.0,Perfect size! Rings are very nice!
5.0,Incredible. I absolutely love it. Looks even better in person.
5.0,They measured exactly as described and work amazing
5.0,Cute on him and price was right.
5.0,"This is a leather belt, not bonded leather. i expect it to last for a long term"
5.0,"Cute style, great fit, nice weight. This will be great in the winter with leggings."
5.0,I like it and the price was right
5.0,These were fantastic!! Fit the dogs well.
5.0,"Its really hard to find vests for little ones especially of 12-18 months old. But this one fits perfectly to my 15 month old son(who is a bit on the taller but thinner side). It works just like any inner wear/vest would do! Really cottony, good absorbant and really stretchy and soft fabric. I wish it would have come in a little more smaller sizes like for newborn or 6 months old., then I would have bought it in bulk for my son who is really a messy eater and needs changing of his clothes every 3-4 hours a day!<br />Best purchase of vests ever.!"
5.0,"so far so good. had about 2 weeks, impressed so far."
5.0,I will be purchasing more of these; they look real
5.0,I got a medium because I‚Äôm a little bottom heavy but it still fit great in the waist. This is such a cute casual dress. I pair with boots and tights when it‚Äôs chilly or just rock the dress with flip flops in warm weather. It‚Äôs very versatile and it‚Äôs held up wash after wash. I will probably order another pattern
5.0,beautiful and dainty.
5.0,"Love the breathable, lightweight, soft, comfortable, cool material it‚Äôs made out of is just right! Doesn‚Äôt stick to your mouth, allows an air pocket to breath comfortably. You can wear it long periods of time outdoors without it causing you to sweat like other kinds do.<br /><br />Highly recommend!"
5.0,"Best underwear I've purchased. These fit great, don't sag, don't ride up and have a comfortable waistband. The material is soft and after several washes they appear durable. There isn't a tag on the waistband so dressing in a dimly lit or dark room requires feeling for the seam at the back of the waistband. There is a small tag inside that will be on your left as you put them on."
5.0,"very cute, makes great gift"
5.0,"Beautiful dress. Color and design just as pictured. My daughter is going to be 7 years old in 3 months, Ordered a size 6 though she wears a size 7 and the length is fine but loose around the chest by 1 inch each side."
5.0,I love this dress it is super cute and fits just right! I can't wait to wear it to work!!
5.0,Looks amazing and its well made
5.0,"i had a pair,of these boots,when i was in the marine corp!!!"
5.0,"I normally use RFID the thin plastic like sleeves or a hard case for my credit cards.  However, I will be using my passport and wanted the same protection.  I do have a waterproof/ RFID pouch but wanted a stylish cover to keep it in and use when needed.  I wanted a leather cover but they are pricey and always black.<br /><br />I love Amazon Prime, so of course I went on line.  The price was great!  The quality is great!  And I love that I could choose something other than black.  Am very happy!"
5.0,"I am a normally 14/16 or a xL so I was a little nervous to buy the 12, but it fit perfectly! I bought this dress for a Halloween costume but I could definitely wear it again! The fabric is light and breathable. It does wrinkle a little but not too bad!"
5.0,I got several compliments while wearing this bathing suit. I have never felt so covered up and sexy at the same time. I LOVED IT.
5.0,Adorable dress
5.0,Amazing nd perfect
5.0,"I couldn't wait to get my waist beads! I will be taking them to Jamaica üáØüá≤  with me. I am pleased with the quality.  I sized up just to be on the safe side,  I normally order 1X I'm a size14-16. I ordered a larger size, the beads fit loosely either way I am happy with my purchase.  If you are on the fence just get them, I did.  üòä"
5.0,"High quality, sharp looking baseball hat? My husband is going to love it. Great stitching. I just love the way the gray with the white look very sharp and complimentary"

5.0,This is a quality item.
5.0,"I love my earrings. I have gotten many compliments on them since I got them. They are bigger than I expected, but I didn't mind. Just be prepared for a bulky pair of earrings."
5.0,"Beautiful, everything I had hoped it would be. I don't love carrying purses often and this holds my  iphone in one pocket and the other zipper pocket fits my ear buds and chapstick. While the inside has all the room for cards and cash."
5.0,Lovely and flattering fit
5.0,Fun to wear. Will re order
5.0,"Purchased an XL  as i didnt want a skin tight dress and something to fit my larger bust in, this fit perfectly!. Purchased for valentines day and my husband loved this one!"

5.0,All as advertised
5.0,Hermoso!  Encantada con el vestido
5.0,"I purchased the Larges being a 36"" waist and I wish I would have bought the XLs. Super tight, especially around the thighs. Otherwise I think they are great! I liked the patterns and they did NOT shrink in the wash!"
5.0,"Great quality, i wear it all the time, nice chain and the connecting piece is heavy and good quality."
5.0,"Very nice, nice size stone and color"
5.0,"I originally bought a black pair and loved them so much I had to buy them in grey, light blue and this dapple print.  They are great for lounging around in and the pockets are fairly deep.  I normally wear a size 16 in jeans and went with XXL because my hips/butt are at 54"" at the widest point while my waist is at 36"".  The fit is great though the legs and the waist is tappers so they don't  slide down off your hips.  I tend to have a problem with them riding up above my waist."
5.0,I get compliments wearing this with the high waisted bottoms
5.0,"This is great for a petite woman, if you want it to hit just below the knees. I'm 5'1&#34;, for reference. Medium fit as expected from the description, and was not too tight."
5.0,Nice hat. Fits as expected.
5.0,"This is exactly what I‚Äôd expect out of a good T-shirt. It‚Äôs soft and comfy, as well as true to size. The logo print on the front is good quality and looks like it‚Äôll stay put through many washes."
5.0,My fianc√© loved this hat! I ordered it so he would have a nice clean hat for our wedding reception & pictures.<br />Good quality material.
5.0,"Perfect size for airplane carry on (book, tablet, snacks, headphones, light windbreaker, wallet, eyeglass case) and day trip (water bottle, microfiber towel, snacks, camera, sunscreen). Bought three and had no zipper or strap problems whatsoever."
5.0,Easy to screw on and clean. The quality is great-don‚Äôt have to worry about threading the .
5.0,"Adorable!  I'm 5'3, 160 pounds and purchased a Large. Super cute and covers my muffin top!  ;)"
5.0,Like ! got it for my nephew
5.0,Super soft and comfortable lounge set! It‚Äôs lightweight so it‚Äôs perfect for the warmer weather.
5.0,Great bracelet for the price
5.0,Very happy with this.  Well made and works fantastic.  Repeat buyer this is a great cloth for shining silver.  Naturally it gets dirty after a while if you have lots to shine so I needed more.
5.0,"I love these shorts! Side ripped at the bottom, I have thick thighs."
5.0,"Awesome,  just a little heavy on face"
5.0,"Great color, fits very well"
5.0,"beautiful necklace with really nice stones. FANTASTIC price for what you get. Is a bit smaller than it appears, but the measurements are correct."
5.0,The hat fits well and is warm and comfortable.
5.0,Very pretty and very non irritating.
5.0,Washable & reusable
5.0,Because I swim at least four times a week this has been an excellent wrap in the locker room! The velcro makes it easy to stay closed plus it continues to absorb excess moisture after the shower. Easy to roll up in my gym bag. Glad I got it!
5.0,I always wanted to try Grillz . 48 years of age. They arrive one day early. I was so excited. I followed the direction . The top ones was too BIG but l LOVE the Bottom. I can Rock the bottoms.  Love them.
5.0,I love this!!! Wish I had ordered it sooner!
5.0,I purchased this shirt on a whim expecting it to be &#34;okay.&#34; It is so comfortable and I received many compliments on it the first time I wore it. It quickly became one of my favorites. I will definitely be purchasing in another color!
5.0,Love them My fianc√© is very happy and they are comfy Thanks
5.0,Great quality. Eye catching.
5.0,These may be my new favorite pajamas. The fit is perfect and the feet fit perfectly. I love them and will be buying another pair.  They did not shrink at all when washed and dryed. They were delivered quickly.
5.0,"I got this for a friend who is like a mom to me. She has a pandora bracelet and has a couple of charms on it, a Russian heart flag and a little St. Basil's Cathedral. I wanted to get her something special for Christmas and looked to see if I could add another little charm to her collection that was the Russia theme as she was a missionary there for 18 years. I was delighted to see this and bought it after reading such great reviews. It did not disappoint! She was delighted by it and even said. ""Your gift to me is much better than what I got you."" That's obviously not the point, but the fact that she was delighted made me happy! This is a great little charm and it's super cute! If I ever get a pandora bracelet for myself, I will most definitely get this little charm for myself as I am Russian and lived there for many years. It was beautifully packaged and had a little anti-fake certificate. Thanks Nina Queen for this beautiful little charm! You've got yourself a loyal customer!"
5.0,I absolutely love these leggings.  The best pair I own.  I love them so much I bought about 10 pairs in different colors.  They fit perfectly.  I am pretty active especially walking my dog every day and these are perfect for that.  I even wear them with a longer shirt and heels to dress them up to run errands or get together with friends.  I am really selective about leggings.  Some just don‚Äôt fit right.  I highly recommend these.
5.0,"Very comfy jeans and good quality. Would buy again! Although they are low rise and i prefer high rise, they did not show any butt crack though (and I have a bigger butt)! Jeans for the win!"
5.0,Warm and fits nicely. Doesn‚Äôt stretch out like most of them do!
5.0,Cute and very stretchy.  Does not give a great deal of support for the pooch but that is what makes it so comfy.
5.0,Made my night!
5.0,"These purses are lightweight, yet hold just enough stuff.  I carry it inside a larger bag and just pull it out.  I use it everyday at work, shopping, traveling, even hiking.  It holds money, credit cards, chap stick, and receipts.  The back slot is just big enough for my iPhone and I've folded up 8.5x11 sheets of paper and stored them in there...with a pen.  Perfect!"
5.0,AWESOME! GREAT! EXCELLENT SELLER!
5.0,I brought this for my son.. And he and I both love the fit. The package came on time as well. So far so good. Thanks

5.0,"11-year old son wears this every day. Perfect for him. He's had it for maybe 6 months, and is pretty rough on it, still going strong. He's 5'6&#34; medium build, fits great!"
5.0,Keeps me so warm - I love the scarf and hat!!!
5.0,Super soft. Generously sized without being sloppy. Has a nice shape and color to it. Lightweight.
5.0,My son likes these. Got stuck in the Sierras for that historic snowstorm!
5.0,"My Dad was cleaning out some cross-country ski gear from his place.  I used it and the old boots had rotted away.  These boots are great. My wife and I plan to take these ""rebooted"" skis up to  Whitegrass in Davis, West Virginia and have a dandy time.  I use the Skis now to walk the dog and take out the trash.  Run the kids to the Bus stop.  Hey if you got a pair of old skis with the three prong 70 some mm.  This is the answer.  I called around up at the mountain and they said they might have some boots somewhere in the back for like $200.  I think these are a value. Hey, go look at those fancy LL Bean websites or REI.  Unless you are like super serious okay, but if you are the average joe taking out the trash running to the corner store just get these and reboot those skis in the attic that Uncle Greg used twice in 1987.  I like them!!"
5.0,Awesome sunglasses definitely want more of the same
5.0,"These diaper covers are a little larger than the description, but I prefer a little to large over smaller than described. These fit great, and they are absolutely adorable!! They make my little girls' dresses puff out in the back and it's just so cute!! I got these in 2 colors and will probably get more!"
5.0,"These are beautiful, I am a teacher and I will give a sent to each of my coworkers on my team at the end of the school year. There were a cute end-of-the-year gift that I was able to afford."
5.0,"Belt looks great.  This is my husband's first ratchet belt.  He loves the concept, and this belt looks awesome.<br /><br />In addition, we had an excellent customer service experience.  On first attempt he cut the belt too short, and we contacted customer service and got a replacement one shipped ASAP.  Note that you will have to cut the belt a little longer than expected.  (see first ratchet on the back of the belt).<br /><br />Overall, highly recommend!"
5.0,Light weigh love that it flares very feminine
5.0,"Took a chance on this bag after reading mixed reviews and let me tell you, am glad I did! I did not run into any issues with smells, noises or bad zippers! Mine is black so maybe depends on the color but I would definitely order another no doubt. Great size bag to take when traveling and you can fit a lot of stuff in here! Plenty of compartments! Worth the price! Stylish bag!"
5.0,Nice. Look great.
5.0,"Never have a complain with the brand, always gets the job done"
5.0,"I love this top but had to return it for a large, it seems to fit more like a junior size. To be fair I am normally a medium or large, I‚Äôm a 38C. It was just a little snug in the chest and tummy area for me, if you want it to be flowy, order a size up, otherwise very nice cute top!"
5.0,"Perfect quality.  Nice to add to my collection of Keychain's for my bike keys!  Stitching looks of good quality, and the resolution is pretty high for the details too!"
5.0,"Just received my paracord replacement band for the apple 4, 44mm and love it!  My wrist is 6 3/4 and the small fits perfectly on the small setting.<br />The screw type pin is a little rough getting used to especially on the smallest setting, but I can live with it.  Overall, the band is very comfortable.  The band holds the watch snug to my wrist for accurate heart and exercise readings. Very happy so far."
5.0,The mask is very comfortable since I need to wear one 8 hours a day. I bought it as a Christmas mask but I can wear it all year. Love it!
5.0,"I adore this dress! I‚Äôve bought it in every single pattern! It is so flattering on. The only thing is, if you‚Äôre cheery like me you‚Äôre gonna need to stitch or safety pin the top unless you don‚Äôt mind showing your goods off a bit! Fits my shape really nicely, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 40s bust, 29 waist, 43 hips, 163 lbs and I ordered an XL"
5.0,These glasses are super cute and sturdy. They feel like they‚Äôll last me a long time and also they flatter my face in ways that my other sunglasses couldn‚Äôt.

5.0,"These are awesome! I love them and would highly recommend them. They stay from on your face , no leaking and are comfortable ."
5.0,My son had slippers in the past that would always wear out fast and couldn't withstand his boyish ways. These hard bottoms are great! He even wears them outside walking down our gravel road to get the mail and they haven't let him down yet. IF they ever do wear out I would order another pair of these because they have already lasted so long in great condition.
5.0,"Just got this yesterday and the mirror was broken, but I'm keeping it anyway because it's PERFECT!!!  I have been struggling at work to hold my ID, smartphone, and keys in my pockets, but this little purse solves all my problems.  People can see the ID through the clear plastic side, and my phone and keys fit inside no prob.  I spent hours searching trying to find a lanyard, ID holder, anything to help, and this purse is exactly what I needed.  Woo-hoo!!!"

5.0,"I ordered this band for one of my watches because the original band was cheap, the clasp was fragile and adjusting the length was practically impossible. This band fit perfectly, the colors match exactly and it feel comfortable and safe on my wrist. The seller explained sizing when ordering and they were right on! Impressed! 5 stars."
5.0,A good fit to my wrist and I love the color
5.0,I love it. Very classy looking and I also got the earrings to go with it. Put clear nail polish over it so it doesn't turn color and diamonds dont fall out
5.0,I have not worn or laundered them yet. But so far they are lightweight and obviously rip-stop material. They fit as expected and are quite comfortable. I expect them to be cool in the hot day.
5.0,LOVE this top! it is super comfy and looks exactly like the picture.  The sleeves are a little long but that's how i like it! I ordered an XL and definitely would purchase again.  It is just so comfy and i think i need to add a few colors to my collection.

5.0,Great quality and excellent price!
5.0,My new favorite shirt! The black is sharp looking!
5.0,I like the thickness of it. I am not plus size but this helps me accentuate my waist and hide some of my muffin tops ;)
5.0,"Ok, I had to send this dress back. I really hated to. I am a tall and thin woman, who large bust. This dress Is beautiful. I unfortunately couldn‚Äôt keep my bust covered. I do not like to show cleavage. I wanted to get something for our trip to Hawaii. I would recommend this dress to any. I‚Äôm top heavy and older, so young lady‚Äôs this is the perfect dress."
5.0,I love my new green agate ring. It's so classy & elegant.
5.0,"I really like the Citizens Watches I have five now in my collection the blue angel was the last piece of the puzzle, they are absolutely the best."
5.0,My kid love it. Wants more!
5.0,"I needed something heavy duty for a camping trip to Utah and California.  I was very impressed with this bag.  I like the metal latches on the shoulder strap instead of the plastic on most bags.  Seems to be constructed good.  It will be tossed around and abused in the next month, so if I have any problems with it, I'll let you know.<br /><br />Up Date:  I put it to the test on the three week camping trip.  I was very impressed as mentioned above.  Very tough bag.  Would buy again."
5.0,I gave it as a gift and she really loved it.

5.0,Disappointing because it was too large but she will grow into it. Loved the little ruffles. A dress that you don‚Äôt see very often. Sweet and can‚Äôt wait till she is able to wear
5.0,"A great and awesome hood, fastens with buttons, not zippers, sew buttons on if they're not already in your jacket, I substituted the ""combat BDU shirt"" with a cold weather liner instead of the M-65 jacket, added buttons and attached per instructions and created a very warm, versatile, lightweight cold weather jacket/coat, very high quality, very strong hood assembly, very warm with the wool lining, this civilian is grateful to buy military gear, love that it's MADE IN USA. Remove copper wire if not wearing helmet, hood will drape better, be warmer, lay down more naturally when not wearing and folded back."
5.0,"These are the most comfortable underwear I've ever worn. They are soft, yet firm. They wash and dry well on normal cycle. Highly recommend these briefs."
5.0,Love everything about this earrings perfect colors size and so lite you can't even fill them in your ears!!!!
5.0,Very nice! This was for my 18 year old grandson and he loves it.
5.0,Liked the product but had to send back for a larger size.  They wouldn't let me just exchange.  I had to refund and purchase new which is kind of a pain.
5.0,My 3 year old daughter loves them. We like that they are not the same. The princesses on the right shoe are different from the princesses on the left shoe. She can't stop jumping in them to get the lights activated.
5.0,Nice touch to have stretchy cord especially for the younger children. Remember to keep the card the necklace is packaged with to know what ‚Äúmood‚Äù each color stands for.
5.0,So cute! Medium fits perfectly. Can't decide what colour bottoms to match with tho!
5.0,comfortable and cute
5.0,I like the necklace and earring set very much. The color is great. Very good buy for the money.
5.0,Fit well. The pieces were well made. Wish it came with an anakin wig. We did have to pin the straps to hold on the shoulder but I would recommend it.
5.0,very pleased!
5.0,Super comfy. I really like this dress.
5.0,Last winter my daughter order a pair of red gloves that turned out not to be very warm.  So when i saw these I hope they would replace the gloves she bought.  She loves them the gloves fit as expected.  They are very warm.<br /><br />The best part of these gloves is the ability to text while wearing them.  She tested them with her phone and was able to easily send text message.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for an honest and fair review.
5.0,awesome shirt
5.0,"Me encant√≥, queda perfecto, yo peso 178 libras y lo ped√≠ talla L"
5.0,Perfect fit and style.
5.0,This was great for my Grandson. I suggest going a size up
5.0,"These are perfect for my 4 yr. old, who is about 3ft tall.  They actually go to her knee or can be scrunched a little above a boot. Adorable!"
5.0,Exactly what I ordered!  Perfect for my daughters first ballet and dance classes.  The quality is amazing and material will hold up for a couple of years!  Love it and shipped great!
5.0,"It. Has. Pockets.<br />Also, bought this as a bridesmaid dress and it was super cute. It is comfortable, flattering, and flowy."
5.0,"I am a longtime owner of the Osprey 20 hydration pack [[ASIN:B014EBPNEI Osprey Packs Manta AG 20 Hydration Pack, Fossil Grey, One Size]] that I use for mountain biking and hiking. I have always loved the bite valve on the reservoir. It doesn't drip and has great flow. I have also owned Camelbak hydration packs in the past but find them less ergonomic and don't like the bite valve as it drips. I have had my pack for 10 years and needed to replace the reservoir and found that the Mazama Windigo [[ASIN:B01CUT242A Mazama Designs Windigo, 3 L Top Fill Hydration Reservoir Water Bladder With Insulated Hose for Most Hydration Pack Water Backpack Replacements]] had a similar bite valve. Since it cost less I decided to pull the trigger. This has definitely been an upgrade. Filling it is a complete no brainier, quick and precise. The handle allows for no spill. I don't have to worry about a screw cap that leaks if not properly secure. When the clamps are down no leaking occurs! It even has clear marks on the side that allow you to measure the amount of water. The wide mouth and detachable hose allow for quick and easy drying. No taste or smell either. Fit my pack perfectly. I noticed that they also have a dual bladder system and would like to try that for electrolytes replacement."
5.0,love them boxers
5.0,"Perfecta opci√≥n,  recomiendo no exceder mas tarjetas de cr√©dito d√©bito y carnet de identificaci√≥n ya que no se recomienda forzar el broche de cierre. Para mi ha funcionado muy bien durante un a√±o. la recomiendo."
5.0,It's a wonderful bag
5.0,"My favorite bag...even better, at a great price."
5.0,Great value and wonderful feel to this shirt that you would not know wasn't pure suede. Washes well! I'm very pleased. Highly recommend.
5.0,"I love the feel and softness of this boot. It's so cute for women! I am very satisfied with my purchase! I received them very quickly.  So, thank you so much to the seller! I will definitely be back to purchase more from your store! Apologies for the picture not being from the side of the shoe! But trust me, they are perfect!"
5.0,I have an obsession with Jordan's and these are by far my favorite ones. Best purchase I've made!
5.0,"I bought this top to layer over a tank for yoga class at the gym. It works perfect! It lays nicely and is flowy. I love that the back is longer and covers my butt while doing yoga just in case!! Lol. Don't want to give any see through shows while bending over in yoga. I try to get good leggings that don't have that issue but I feel like they all are a tad see through. Anyways, I think this top would be super cute to wear out with some shorts this summer too."
5.0,Love this bag.  Light weight and carries every thing I need for the gym
5.0,will make a great Christmas gift
5.0,"Purchased as a gift, person receiving gift stated they loved it."
5.0,It's really light but it looks good
5.0,"I see older reviews that say to size down, but I found the opposite. Maybe they changed the sizing or materials since those past reviews. I'm an 8.5 with a very narrow foot, and I found the Mediums to be too tight. Large fit perfectly, but I can't see how anyone size 10-12 with a wide foot could fit the Large - seems like it would be way too tight"
5.0,"Plain Black?....hardly....beautifully black- dress up your outfit...or just add a nice simple scarf accessory. You cant go wrong with the light weight sheer chiffon scarf. It is a large square well finished, scarf. So many ways in which you can wear and tie it. I have given 5 step by step ideas below, but there are several ideas on the internet- videos and other step by step with pictures....so have fun!<br />wear as a cover up for the beach, or over a tank to dress up as an over shirt, so many possibilities.<br /><br />This scarf can make a plain T-shirt look cool, or make your neck warm when the temperature gets cool.<br /><br /> Here are five looks to do with a long rectangular scarf, and one for a large square scarf.<br /><br />Step-by-Step<br /><br />1. The Pull-Through Knot: After hanging scarf around the back of neck, tie a loose knot on one side. Pull the other end through the knot. Slide knot up or down.<br /><br />2. Loop-and-Knot: Drape the scarf around your neck front to back, pulling ends around to the front, so the scarf is looped once around neck. With the ends, repeat steps in Knot Pull-Through.<br /><br />3. Turtleneck Scarf: Drape the scarf as you did in the Loop-and-Knot. Tie the ends loosely together, and pull up the knot to hide under the section looped around the neck.<br /><br />4. The Loop: Fold scarf in half. Drape around the back of the neck, and pull both ends through the loop formed by the fold.<br /><br />5. The Loop Through: Follow the same steps as in The Loop, but only pull one end through the loop. With the second end, go over the top of the loop, and pull through in the opposite direction.<br /><br />6. The Chic, Parisian Necktie: Fold the scarf into a triangle. Starting at the point, roll into a coil. Hand around the back of the neck. Tie a knot, left-over-right, right over-left.<br /><br />I purchased this scarf at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,Perfect fit! I will be buying more.
5.0,"I liked everything:  the front zipper works perfect, easy  and it's discrete, the support is great, the material thick enough,  so for me the optional  pads are not needed, it fells very very comfortable and the shape very natural, just the good covering not less nor more. The price is very convenient taking into account it's  good quality.<br />I bought small and my size is 34B. Fits perfect<br />It's so comfortable that I wish they offer more colors to wear it everyday..."
5.0,"While I had issues with my first order of this product, the company made good on my issues and the replacement  was perfect.  I got excellent customer service and my boss loved his birthday gift."
5.0,Durable and fit good. He used these everywhere in the islands.

5.0,Very comfortable. Socks fit as expected. Love this brand.
5.0,Very pretty.  Well pleased

5.0,Wife is happy! :)
5.0,fits perfectly and super comfortable and cute! you won't regret.  Buy your normal size
5.0,"Cute, but I'm 5' 11"" 190 pounds and normally wear a M/L, but this swimsuit I purchased in a M was a no-go"
5.0,"I loved this top, and my granddaughter loved it."
5.0,"I have both sides of my nose pierced and I only buy these I love them, and it is slow shipping but the price is great and product has quality ."
5.0,Love this shirt. It is very comfortable and looks great on- received many compliments when I wore it. The material is a mixture of cottony-t-shirt and silky- it‚Äôs very soft.
5.0,The gloves fit well and I like the elastic around the wrist. I've only worn them in temperatures above 40F with 15mph winds and that was fine.
5.0,"Very comfy, love the colors, super soft"
5.0,"Not what I expected but it was my fault not theirs. Picture shows it as is. I didn't really like it myself because it just looked like a long chain pull, again, my fault not the company's"
5.0,Absolutely love it!
5.0,These are perfect for reading while glancing up at the tv at bedtime.
5.0,"I love this bracelet. It fits like it was made for me, and the strong magnetic clasp is awesome. I saw something similar on a jewelry store website but the price was extremely high so I went looking for a reproduction. The two metals aren‚Äôt as starkly different as they are in the picture, and of course I will come back with an update if it turns my wrist green."
5.0,It was a birthday gift for a friend and she just giggled... loved it!!
5.0,Wife loves these
5.0,Amazing replacement band for my Fitbit. Well made and super cute!!!
5.0,Perfect fit!  My husband loved it!
5.0,I bought both the Rim Job Cleaner and the Rim Job wheel polish and I highly recommend both products. The cleaner make cleaning the wheels so easy to do on a weekly basis and by using the polish the wheels don't seem to collect as much brake dust. I will continue to use these products on both my Carrera and on my Audi A5. Alan
5.0,"This dress is perfect! I got it for my trip to Jamaica and I'm so glad I did!! The material is not what I expected and I DID NOT read the info so that's my mistake. Even so, the material is actually flattering and this dress slim my belly/hips. The length is perfect as well. I will be utilizing the dress as often as I can! I highly recommend it and am so excited to have my first maxi!"
5.0,I love the cap.. it fits great and keeps my head warm..
5.0,I like these socks for a couple of reasons. They look good and my job has me on my feet for some very long shifts so the compression of these socks really helps me. They fit me as expected and they haven't streched out or lost their compression after repeated wash and wear.
5.0,i like everything about the handbag
5.0,Ordered a medium. I am 5'7 and 139 pounds. I loved the fit and material.
5.0,"I just put my good-luck charm on the chain, and it looks great.  My necklace is a 30 inch, so I don't have to struggle with the catch, as I just pull it right over my head.  I dislike all catches, so I can't be objective in comparing them.  The chain is slender and glows, and was delivered on time. I'm very pleased with the purchase."
5.0,"These are hands down the best sunglasses I have ever owned. The polarization is so unique that no other brands can touch. They stay on your fave no matter what, and they are so confortable! BUY THESE SUNGLASSES"
5.0,Not a lot to say about this one; it polishes my jewelry well. I do like the large size; it should last quite a while.
5.0,"OMG I *LOVE* this little wallet.  So many slots for all my cards and now I feel so much more safe and secure while I'm out shopping.  No more worrying about those scammers out there trying to scan my wallet.  Besides being super functional, this wallet is beautiful too!  Nice & compact.  This was just a little gift to myself for added peace of mind."
5.0,"Been using it for a couple of months now and I can assure you that this product is really good, still looks really shiny just like the picture, hasn‚Äôt faded or anything"
5.0,Perfect fit for our 6yr old! &#60;3
5.0,i love this bikini!! i tried in on for the first time today and i feel in love with the color. the fir is great for my small boobs and the bottoms have the perfect amount of cheekiness.
5.0,I been wearing this thing 24/7 for more then a month haven't even took it off through multiple daily showers (wouldn't recommend) but it's still the same so far
5.0,Awesome product.  Highly recommended!  Fast delivery!

5.0,They were what I expected!
5.0,"These fit so well! The material is incredibly soft, but not very breathable.  I would wear these more to chill in versus doing yoga.  I would buy again and again."
5.0,Great quality for the price. Used as a gift in gift baskets for teachers. Will buy again!
5.0,very cute shirt and good material
5.0,"Beautiful bag, lots of room, very sturdy canvas. Has a zippered pocket in the inside and another one on the outside, which closes with a metal clasp. It looks like a smaller version of a messenger bag. The print is beautiful. Just an amazing bag. I am in love! =)"

5.0,Very sweet and sentimental
5.0,Fast shipping! Item just as described...and it fits my small hands!
5.0,Need more
5.0,Bought two pair for both hubby and I. I love them. They fit snug and they are warm. The touch feature is awesome and just what I've been dreaming of. I used to hate the choice between cold hands or answering my phone.
5.0,My Husband is a Dale Earnhardt fan and he really likes this hat. His old one wore out.
5.0,"This necklace is almost identical to one that I lost and I must say, this one is better. Its more detailed and feminine than my other one. I love it"
5.0,Love this dress! Perfect for work! Very professional and perfect length.
5.0,"It fits like a glove one-size-fits-all unless you have an abnormally large size head than this would not be for you, but for the average person go ahead and buy it. You‚Äôll love it!"
5.0,I really like the size of the earring and the quality is great! I bought them for my second piercing hole next to the first. I had hopes that they would be small enough where I can leave them on and not have to switch them and thats exactly what I got! I haven't taken them off since I bought them about 3 weeks ago. They have rusted or damaged my ears. Highly recommend.
5.0,"Love this , looks great"

5.0,I have received several compliments on the watch and have enjoyed the look and feel of the watch so much I will only wear it when attending a function. I am even thinking about purchasing the black faced watch as well.
5.0,Cute fun party favor
5.0,"As usual Double D does not disappoint. Expect to wear a top tucked in as the volume of fabric within the bottoms needs to have a fitted top.  The waist and lower waist is slimming, but if you are a hippy gal, this style may add too much within the hip area, or for certain body types it may conceal the area with fabric."
5.0,It fits and they are very nice.
5.0,This shirt is perfect for fall!
5.0,My daughter loves that there is kittens at the bottom.
5.0,These chains are sturdy. They are real Sterling silver. They're easy to put a pendant or bead on it.

5.0,Love it! Just what I wanted and came very nicely packaged.
5.0,This dress fits very nicely and it's true to size.
5.0,"I bought these shorts specifically for hiking. I hiked 8 miles in 90+ degree weather and these shorts were amazing. They kept me cool and the material withstood a couple miles of bush whacking. For reference I'm 5'8, 140 lbs and the medium fit great. If they add more colors I will definitely be buying more!"
5.0,"Lovely, gorgeous silver! High quality.  Carolyn Pollack thank you!"
5.0,"The pearls look better than the photo!  Since faux jewelry is actually more in style than real jewelry, they are a great buy.  I would recommend to lovers of faux jewelry as a fashion accessory."
5.0,My favorite purse ever!
5.0,"Great find for me! These beanies are exactly what my little grandson needed. Fleece lined, stretchy and super well made. He loves them. And so do I!"

5.0,"Love everything about these Capri pants.<br />I am 5&#34;8 125 lbs, they fit & feel wonderful.<br />Nice & light, but strong enough to hold up to a good work out. I wish they had more bright colors"
5.0,"I was surprised by how cute this was, actually. It fit exactly as expected. The waist was stretchy. There is a built-in slip underneath the dress so it doesn't stick to your butt, which is great. The color was exactly as pictured, too. The material was a great quality for the price, too. Overall, 10/10. I am definitely going to be buying some dresses from this place again. I attached some pictures. I'm pleased."
5.0,Lightweight. The quality was fine.
5.0,"Really nice wallet, spaces to put credit cards are wider then other wallets. your cars actually go in without struggling"

5.0,it's perfect for my iPhone8!
5.0,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I love this shirt. It fits perfectly!  Great quality for the price. Shipped earlier than expected!
5.0,"These glasses are great for the price. They look cool but more importantly they work great for fishing.  They fit great and are relatively cheap!  I lose and break sunglasses on occasion from wear and abuse and I ordered several pairs for future use.  As long as they keep making them I will keep using them, until something better comes along, if that happens."
5.0,"Purse is very high quality, and packaging was beautiful, it felt like opening a Christmas gift! I am very pleased! All zippers work, has a lot of storage room, and the appearance is as pictured"

5.0,Great little cover
5.0,Sharp looking shirt for the price. Perfect fit!
5.0,I bought this dress for a wedding that I'm going to. I was a little nervous to buy a dress online but it fits perfectly. It's stretchy so you don't have to worry about it being too tight as long as you get the right size
5.0,"Just as advertised! Large cases, seemingly well made."
5.0,I get tons of compliments on this hat. It looks amazing on stage. I would love to get all of the colors
5.0,Got it for a wedding.  Should work very well
5.0,It is very roomy I love it

5.0,I love the warmth of it. I wear it when I have to run out to run errands.
5.0,T-shirt is very thick and comfortable. The letters are already coming off after wearing and washing a handful of times. Even turned it inside out but the corners are still pulling up.
5.0,"I loved everything about this sweater! It‚Äôs so comfortable! It can be worn casually or it can be dressed up. It‚Äôs a little on the bigger than ‚Äútrue to size‚Äù but it is meant to be worn a little loosely. You won‚Äôt regret the purchase, enjoy!"
5.0,What treat to own a ratchet belt.  Adjust to perfect size unlike belts with standard holes.  Material is strong and durable
5.0,"These mittens are just what I was looking for. The string between the two is significant enough that I don't worry about it snapping with the slightest tug and the mittens are soft and cozy on my one year old's hands. Does she keep them on? Not for long, but at least I don't have to worry about losing them!"

5.0,Soooo cute!!!
5.0,Use them when I take my dog for a walk.  Keeps the wind out of my eyes.<br />Just what I wanted!
5.0,"Exactly how it‚Äôs explained, compact sleek wallet which fits approximately 8 cards well"
5.0,"Love these plugs, I got 0g size, when you look at them in the light they are gorgeous. I received a darker pair so when it‚Äôs actually in you can‚Äôt really see the beautiful colors so well, looks more like a more transparent black plug. But besides that, it‚Äôs exactly as advertised and I can‚Äôt complain."
5.0,The best watch ever I get it thank you excellent design scratch proof waterproof dust proof thanksfor designers
5.0,"Nice shoes for kids , have lasted so far it‚Äôs been two months"
5.0,Very nice material. Usually I wear a medium or large. Happy I chose the large this time as it is clingy. Length is prfect!
5.0,nice watch as pictured
5.0,Everyone wants one now I created a trend
5.0,"I might have finally found a dress that I like from Amazon that is how I expected to fit and flow at the right size I wear and the right material as my other maxi dresses.  I would buy more, but all were double the price of this one.  Got lucky on a good deal with this one.  I‚Äôm going to wait for the others to go on  sale so I can buy more."
5.0,I think they will be nice and cool in the gym. I haven‚Äôt worn them yet.

5.0,This product is great. It came in great shape and my daughters face was a classic when she opened this for Christmas. She had no idea what it was!! She wanted an ear ring holder for a long time and the ones in stores were small and cheap. This even matched her room. I would recamend this product.
5.0,"It is a little loose on my head, but that is a plus in this hot weather.  It is cute and I really need the protection from the sun."

5.0,Very nice and clear.
5.0,Nice romper.
5.0,Love these shoes planning on buying again
5.0,"It was great. It does have a good bit of toile, so gives it some weight."

5.0,It is very warm and I received it in a timely manner
5.0,"THIS is such a happening top that it will be replacing several things in my closet.  It is warm and snuggly, almost like a soft baby blanket, long enough to keep you warm all over and very attractive.  The flowers on the front add a graceful touch and the back is just fun.  It fits me as an XL and I expect to get many cries from my young relatives who will want to take it over. No way.  This is  a keeper.. or a great gift."
5.0,My little tassel thing fell apart pretty quickly but it didn‚Äôt bother me one bit. I LOVE this wallet and I honestly don‚Äôt see myself buying any other wallet now that I‚Äôve found this one. My best friend even got one because I spoke so highly about it and she loves hers too. It‚Äôs so convenient to have the detachable card holder to just throw in the diaper bag or to just jumo in the car and run a quick errand. I‚Äôm terrible at using a purse so this is perfect for me.
5.0,Prefect...Love it so much
5.0,Amazing waist trainer! Has so much support does not bend at mid section like others tend to do. Does make you sweat a bit.

5.0,So classy looking. I love them!
5.0,I love this dress! The material is soft and fits accordingly. I'm getting a few more colors:)
5.0,"4 stars only because this coat arrived in a soft mail pak that was never sealed by Amazon shipper! ... but somehow managed to get here okay anyways ... sloppy NO sealing up of the package! ... Moving on ... I live in Hawai‚Äôi and every time I go up to around 6000‚Äô at Pu‚Äôuhuluhulu to join the defenders of Maunakea ... I feeze to death! I am 69 and cannot take the cold windy temperatures up there and so especially dreading when it is winter! ... I am a size 6-8 about 5‚Äô6 and 115lbs (largest in bust, narrow hips, so ordered the medium and it is just right! But if one‚Äôs arms are extra long, medium might not work ... as just barely just right for me ... love the length not many other brands offer ... it fits well not too tight and can have a not bulky layer or 2 underneath ... I did not want down because up on the Mauna when the wind & clouds roll in, it is so wet and nasty! ... will update after trying it out soon"
5.0,"These feel great on.  Not difficult to put on, but yet feel nice and snug once on. Recommend"
5.0,Husband absolutely loves these. Comfortable and easy on and off. Wipable if you get them dirty. The colors are really nice.
5.0,"The shirt looks great and perfect for someone who loves vintage fireworks!  The shirt itself is soft and very comfortable and the logo looks great on it!  It's a little lighter-weight, which is perfect for the summer and for comfort.<br /><br />The seller (Trau-Loevner) was amazing and went above and beyond when we had issues with the shirt; the first shirt had some imperfections but the replacement was perfect, so it was just a fluke on the first one."
5.0,Love this shirt. I had shoulder surgery and it came in very handy when it came to moist surgery needs. I continue to use it during my  Physical Therapy sessions. I get slot of comments about the shirt! I plan on wearing it again when I have the opposite shoulder surgery scheduled in a few months.
5.0,"I bought this sunglasses strap for when I go paddle boarding on the lake.  I was terrified of losing my good sun glasses to the lake monster!  (And because of my light colored eyes, I need to wear good glasses all the time.)<br /><br />Can confirm - this does allow the sunglasses to float on top of the water if you fall into the water!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It does add a little extra padding to the arms of the sunglasses so it does press on your skull a little and you can be a little tender when you take them off when you get off the water.  But it is worth it to not lose sunglasses.<br /><br />- I spend a lot of my time on the lake where the water can be a little dirty.  A trip through the washing machine doesn't get all of the dirt and sweat out but for the price, you can buy one or two and cycle them through the washing machine."
5.0,"Perfect little holiday dress for any office party or family gathering for anyone at any age. I am a true size 8 and a little busty at a 36 full C, but I ordered a small anyway and it fit perfect. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it is stretchy so even if you are unsure about what size to get just stay true to what you normally wear and you should be fine. I plan on ordering another one just because they are so comfortable and so inexpensive. Delivery was fast too. Highly recommend"
5.0,Super cute gift!
5.0,"I love these shoes! I have small feet, so I can wear kids shoes. Kids shoes have some fun colors!"
5.0,This is a charming necklace especially for girls who love fairies.
5.0,"These are a great value for the money. I use one to keep my hiking shoes in, another for my water shoes when I‚Äôm done playing water volleyball, & I pack the other one in my suitcase. They‚Äôre big enough to hold any shoes or short/ankle boots."
5.0,"This is a very cute and fashion. We ladies something wants some cute and fun assessor to bring up our active young mindset, this necklace achieve this goal. It is in very good size as it is not too big. It can be used for teenager or mature women. I recommend this product."
5.0,I love how the sleeves fit at the wrists. The sweater looks stylish and effortless. Worth the buy!
5.0,gorgeous for my little one who is going to have her first communion.

5.0,I want to use it everyday now!
5.0,It worked!
5.0,Bought them for husband. He loves them. Hard to find a good pair of black denim shorts. Will buy more.
5.0,"Great scarf. Soft material, amazing colors, and nicely made. I've gotten some bad/scratchy shemaghs on Amazon, this is not one of them. Definitely getting another in the future"
5.0,Exactly as expected! My husband has these in all grey and wanted a brighter pair.
5.0,"Based on reviews I decided to get the xxl. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 240 lbs and it fits nicely. Enough room to wear a sweatshirt underneath comfortably. It‚Äôs not too thin and not too thick. I look forward to wearing this summer!  Don‚Äôt second guess, but it!"
5.0,My son in ROTC (3rd year) requested these. I received an unprompted text that he was  really happy with them. He NEVER texts first...
5.0,"This brush worked great for what it is intended to. It, along with the ""cleaner"" got off some spots but not all."
5.0,Quality materials and excellent size
5.0,"Very nice shirt.  Washes well.  I hung to dry, no dryer."
5.0,no brainer to use for a charge. I like it!!!
5.0,These hoops make me feel classy and sassy. Perfect for all occasions. Great hoops. High polished. Lightweight and easy to put on and take off. Delivered in 2 days. The box was beautiful.
5.0,"I love these pants. I can‚Äôt imagine using them to work out though. I think they are perfect for a dressy casual look (but not casual Friday at the office-not very business like). They swish as one walks, offering brief glances of leg. I feel comfy, flirtatious and feminine. I have paired them with sandals with a 2 inch heel."
5.0,It's great Quality for the price. Very easy to adjust the size too fit your wrist perfect..
5.0,"Very pretty dress, true to size.  Did not expect it to be as long as it was.  Took it to be altered.  My daughter is 5'2&#34; so it leaves alot of length for the different heights which is good."
5.0,Love product
5.0,LOVE!  I'll be wearing these for my wedding.  SUPER fast delivery.  Beautiful packaging.  These are really so pretty!
5.0,"I was looking for star earrings & fell in love with these! They look great, they're not too big or small, and they don't irritate my ears at all (I have a nickel allergy). Love 'em! üíñ"
5.0,"100% exactly what I wanted,thanks again."
5.0,exelente gracias.
5.0,"Super cute, great find!!"
5.0,Not a good style for my shape. The pockets didn‚Äôt help that. I would be cute on a slender figure. And it was comfy. Loved the color.
5.0,Very elegant watch
5.0,I SAW THE FRAME IN THE OPTOMETRIST'S OFFICE AFTER AN EYE EXAM. I FELL IN LOVE!!!! PRICE TAG IN THE DR'S OFFICE WAS $399 WITHOUT MY PRESCRIPTION LENSES! YES....THREE HUNDRED & NINETY NINE DOLLAR!!! OF COURSE I COME HOME SAD BCUZ I HAD TO LEAVE THE EXPENSIVE FRAME WHERE IT WAS!!! GOOGLE!!! AMAZON!!!! LIKE MAGIC!!!! $69.99!!!!!!!!
5.0,It really works!
5.0,"The jeans fit to size. They are very comfortable. They hug my hips without choking me. If you have an active life/job where you move alot, walking, constantly up and down then these are the pants for you. I have not had any proplems with them loosing and having to constantly pull them back up like with most jeans. They actually stay put. I luv them."
5.0,Great for making shirts .
5.0,I love this shirt. It is soft and beautiful. It is light enough to wear in the Arizona weather.
5.0,I love this top. The cut is awesome and it‚Äôs very comfortable. It does run small so go a size up... two sizes if you‚Äôre well endowed in the chest region.
5.0,These slippers are really cute and cuddly.
5.0,"Fits perfec!t im short (barely 5'1) and I finally don't have to roll up the bottoms of my yoga pants. I wouldn't call them warm, they're perfect for a cool day but aren't super thick  like fleece. Loved the first set so much I ordered another!"
5.0,"These little house dresses come in a 2 pack!($19.99)!! other sellers are charging that plus for only one of  the same item‚Ä¶<br />they are a bit  heavier than the tricot fabric,<br />so not very see through, and only bit shiny, plus they have a R. pocket. I am 5 2‚Äô about 115 and bought medium which fits comfortably with a little extra room. Although gathered at the top  they have a straight cut and fall just below the knee. Small would have probably been ok but barely, plus there is no give to the fabric.<br />I haven't washed/dried yet but the tag says ok to do so. They are all polyester, so I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to shrink anyway, but if so should still be OK! Definitely happy to have stumbled on these‚Ä¶and am buying another set!"
5.0,All fans will love this
5.0,"This top fits me perfect and it‚Äôs a fashion statement, gotten a lot of compliments."
5.0,Very comfortable with great arch support. Got lots of compliments.
5.0,"practical and super comfortable, ah nothing is marked"
5.0,Nice and soft loved it
5.0,"She has a slightly narrow foot and these worked for her for a easy summer sneaker to pop on for trips to the mall, beach, ice cream, walks in the neighborhood, playing. She is not using these as a running shoe. Colorful and fun. I've had issues with the quality of the Sketchers with the rhinestones and bling, no issues with these, velcro works fine, laces are good."
5.0,I have gotten SO many compliments from complete strangers on this bag! It's super fun (like all the Tokidoki prints!) and a really nice size.  I can fit probably more than I actually need to be carrying around in this bag. It has a few inside pockets and I put my keys and lip gloss (that I never put on) in the small pockets.  I bought a Tokidoki wallet to use as well!
5.0,Love these! Super cute and a great buy!
5.0,They arrived on time and looked exactly as pictured. I‚Äôm very pleased with the overall quality and price. They were the perfect addition to my husband‚Äôs business attire.
5.0,Great shorts! They do run a bit small so if you are between sizes order up. Great for the pool or working out!
5.0,Absolutely love this shirt! It's actually far more appealing than the model picture. The material seems strong and should last a long time. This is defintely my favorite shirt!
5.0,Used for a tree topper and worked perfectly
5.0,I love my dress
5.0,Good workout shorts. I like the side pockets for my phone
5.0,Fit perfectly and came quickly if you‚Äôre using it for Lolita I‚Äôd recommend buying too. One on its own just isn‚Äôt quite poofy enough.
5.0,Great fit and very comfortable
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Niece loved it.
5.0,"Great Service, fits a little small"
5.0,"I used these for an invitation I created for my moms 70th birthday. Although they were silver, I painted them with a gold sparkle nail polish because I needed gold. The painted great, and I got a lot of compliments about the invitations. Some of them were unusable, but I ordered extra just in case of defects. There were only three defected of the 50 I ordered, so not a big deal."
5.0,They look and fit good
5.0,"BUY THESE NOW!!!<br />These fit perfectly, except they are long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 190 lbs, 46‚Äù hips, & got the XL. They‚Äôre so comfy you can sleep in them, & the waist band does not roll down! The tummy control is good, too. HOWEVER, if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have a butt‚Äù, no leggings will ‚Äúgive‚Äù you one. But if you have been blessed in the derri√®re like myself, these WILL accentuate what you have, & do so very well! My husband loves them, & so do I! I spent hrs looking for the best ones. These had the best reviews. And I will add, they are NOT see thru!! So if you‚Äôre brave enough to show everyone everything you have (they show every nook & cranny), then you can actually wear these out. IF you want everyone to look at you (which I do not, so I only wear these at home.) But they have boosted my confidence so much!! Buy these!!"
5.0,Love the quality for the price
5.0,Great quality. Helps keep my husband‚Äôs shirts looking crisp. My husband loves them and wished had had them during his time at the citadel. no issues so far with shirts tearing/wearing through. We have had them for 8 months.
5.0,My husband wears a hat everytine he goes outside and loves the Scala brand.  I'm guessing that will be the only brand he wears from now on as he loved his first and now has two more.  Other brands are just hanging there!
5.0,Got the jeans for my son and he loves them. Fit perfectly.
5.0,Wore on a longhaul transpacific flight.  These were extremely comfortable both for feet and calves.  These offer great support and are perfect for travel and on-your-feet all day jobs.  Easy to was and hold up to repeated use.
5.0,Super comfortable out of the box fit as expected
5.0,Looks just like my Wirehair!
5.0,Arrived on time and exactly as expected.
5.0,"Nice earrings. Longer studs for ears, I like that. Very cute."
5.0,Fit was great and what I wanted for the beach.
5.0,The case fits nicely around the phone and holds it tight and safe. The cut outs are in the right place and work great the cut out for the camera doesn't get in the way of the shot or decrease quality of photo. The kick stand for the case is also great and works properly as said. It feels very professional and over all a nice build.
5.0,SAME AS PIC
5.0,I bought the mustard and Love it! It could be thicker but I don't  think anyone makes thick sweatshirts anymore. It if soft and comfy! I bought a Large. I am 5 foot 2 and 160 LBS 34 triple D and it fits perfect. I have  not washed it yet but it seems it will hold up well.
5.0,Like the way the socks feel and really help me get through the day. Great value for money and will definitely be buying more from this company. Real fast delivery..thanks
5.0,"These made for adorable party favors! The girls loved them and I thought the price was fair for the product. We did have one pair that was missing the jewel for the eye, but had no problem with the others falling out."
5.0,My wife loves their jewelry.
5.0,"Cheap material, yes. But it's $20! Fit was very flattering. And dressed up, looks and photographs very well. Sexy. Classy.<br />I'm 5'8, 160 lbs, DD chest. Large was definitely the right size. (Too small or tight and the fabric will stretch too much and no longer look blue - it will look stretched and whitish)"
5.0,"Watch came as shown in the posting. Good quality. Band is thick, flexible rubber and sturdy so I don‚Äôt expect wear and tear to affect it any time soon."
5.0,"Looks just like the pic, a very cool/modern looking mouse pad and goes great with my decor. And it works well, mouse glides over it just perfectly. Love it!"
5.0,"Great photo bag. This served me like a champ on my recent European trip. Plenty of space, the top zips fully shut which is a huge improvement over previous ThinkTank bags I've had. With full zip closure you don't have to worry about stuff falling out when you're running through the airport and tossing the bag into plane overhead bins and stuff. The only slight downsides are the seatbelt material in for the shoulder strap. The length control thinger slips in the fabric and you'll find your shortly cinched strap slides down to full extension after walking around in hellhole Rome for an hour. Also the little snap thing for the flap comes undone when you have the bag fully loaded and pick it up by the hand strap. Not big deals in the grand scheme, but the design could use a tweak."
5.0,"I was looking for pants that were comfortable for lounging and for activities like biking, hiking, elliptical workouts etc.  These fit that bill perfectly -- fit exactly as expected (I am 5'8"", 175 lbs - a regular Large fit perfectly.  The fabric is soft but stretches nicely --- and has generous sized front pockets -- a very nice feature.  Very satisfied."
5.0,"While there isn‚Äôt a lot that can be said about rings, and these have obviously fulfilled their purpose, I appreciate that they arrived very quickly!"
5.0,"Love this top and it is so slimming, soft, and comfortable!"
5.0,Was absolutely perfect for Disney on Ice!
5.0,Got this as a gift for a friend and they loved it!!
5.0,Very cute set!! Good quality and brilliant colors! Fit great!
5.0,Absolutely love the KLIM brand. They make high quality products. I usually wait for the sales to purchase as not to put such a dent in the wallet!
5.0,"I have several pairs of dark frame glasses, and I bought these spring of 2014 as I wanted something lighter in shade. These glasses are flattering and subtle.  I receive many compliments on them as the Sage color is so different.  You can't tell by the picture but the frames are an opaque sage on the arms and near the sides of the frames, and it actually becomes more of a transparent sage color as it blends toward the center of the glasses around the bridge.  It is extremely subtle and very unique looking.  Great pair of lighter color frames that goes well with light color outfits.  It also freshens my face up as I have dark brown/black hair and ivory skin.<br /><br />These are also light weight and has a hinged arm.  The Valentino signature of the studs are also subtle.  These are my second pair of Valentino frames and they are timeless and sturdy.  If you've tried them on and hesitated on getting these-- I would get them before they're gone."
5.0,I love it!!! Very easy to put on it slides easily on to the ear and its an eye catcher. And its not to heavy very light in the ears in the pic im wearing the earring
5.0,So cute!! Love the length and colors!

5.0,I found plenty of La Cera dresses on Amazon at very good prices. They are SO comfortable and easy to care for. They have lovely designs and fit really well.
5.0,This hat is lightweight and it fits beautifully.  The brim is not too wide but wide enough to offer protection from the sun.  I love the light color and feel it will pack easily for travel.
5.0,Very beautiful.  Great quality. Wife loved it.
5.0,Easy to paint on just  wish they were a little cheaper for rocks
5.0,EXCELENTE

5.0,üëèüèª
5.0,I love the socks!
5.0,Awesome pin to place on my backpack.
5.0,product was very nice but just was too big in the breast section for me.
5.0,"Delivery time EXCELLENT!! Nice hat,bought it for Halloween. Well packed.<br />Thanks"

5.0,They're perfect I can use them on my bike at night
5.0,Perfect fit and style for flashy occasion
5.0,My husband works outdoors and has to wear safety glasses. These look nice and most important they are polarized. He says they are comfortable and they are easy on the wallet. Great shipping!
5.0,The hat is a little meh but I have my own ash snapback im going to wear instead. But I think the costume is cute. I got a medium and I am 5'10 175lbs usually like a medium/large. its slightly small on the arms but its fine I can still wear it. if you want it roomy i would go a size up
5.0,This is the second time I have purchased this watch for my husband.  The watch ran beautifully until the battery died.  He wanted another one exactly like it.  It is very attractive even though he wears it in the shop.
5.0,They are lovely and stretchy! I'm 5'11 and they are long enough too...which is super rare for me. Go up a size!
5.0,Super soft material. Love the pockets. Perfect for lounging around the house during covid
5.0,Wonderful gift
5.0,"Nice and good fabric, the printing is also of good quality. Everybody make comments on the t-shirt, always a good conversation starter.<br />The fit though has changed. I purchased two Life is Good t-shirts three years ago and they were size Medium, now I had to return the Medium and order Small, and I am 5'10"" @ 165lbs. I kept this Medium one a gave it to someone else who is larger than me."
5.0,I love love love this watch band. It is exactly what I have been looking for for a year. It stays in place even in my sleep.
5.0,"My boyfriend loves this shirt, however, after the first wash it shrunk.  Would buy again and wash separately."
5.0,This was the fastest delivery I've received from a seller.  The shoe is beautiful and very well made. I would definitely recommend this purchase if you love shoes like I do‚Ä¶you will be very pleased.

5.0,"Hands down my favorite pair of shorts I bought for my son. The details are amazing, they are comfortable, and just so cute! I want to buy them in more colors/ shades but they have been out of stock."
5.0,very nice. she loved it.
5.0,super comfortable. not quite sure over long term wash and wear they will survive (i suppose if i wasn't too lazy to let them air dry it would be better) but they look like the picture and i sized up one size just to be sure of the fit and baggyness after washing and am very happy
5.0,"super comfy, arrived on time."
5.0,"You get 6 beautiful pairs of different sunglasses with DG on them. They each come wrapped separately in plastic, so you can give them as gifts. Each one comes with a cloth DG bag to put the sunglasses in to store. Definitely worth the value."
5.0,I bought 2 of these for my 13 and 20 year old boys.  They love them and so do I.  The sound is crisp and clear and the battery life is great.  I am awaiting them to be in stock again so I can order 2 more for me and my brother in law.
5.0,Very nice and good value. It‚Äôs lightweight and covers even long tops.
5.0,love these Russell hoodies. They are the only brand i will wear now. i own 3 of them.
5.0,good leather
5.0,"Sized perfectly, looks like the real thing"
5.0,It is perfect
5.0,"Awesome Lobbo tank, Very Comfortable for  any Exercises, Thank you"
5.0,Gift for my daughter but I know it will fit.
5.0,"I‚Äôm really loving this watch. It‚Äôs quickly become one of my favorite watches. There are so many good things about it: it‚Äôs under $150, it‚Äôs a dive style watch from a reputable company in Citizen, I like the giant hour markers and hands, the bezel has a great and unique look to it, the lume is pretty good,  it has decent water resistance at 100m (330 ft) and I actually like the somewhat big 45mm case.<br /><br />There‚Äôs only a couple of flaws to the watch. First of all, the strap has to go. I changed it out immediate to a Panerai style camo strap. Secondly, some people may not consider this a true ‚Äúdive‚Äù watch as it only has 100m of water resistance. But honestly, is anyone really using a watch to go scuba diving? I feel like the water resistance rating is given way too much attention when people review watches. Lastly, the movement is kind of noisy. This is probably the most glaring problem with this watch. This is by far the noisiest watch I‚Äôve ever owned. I can actually hear the movement rattling around inside the case when I move my arm around. And when changing the date and day, it makes some unpleasant noises that I could do without.<br /><br />Overall, while this watch has a few minor flaws, the pros easily outweigh the cons. And it feels great in my wrist."
5.0,I really like this western looking bracelet.
5.0,I purchased the gold colored glasses in January and 8 months later they're still in good condition. These were the only glasses I wore during the summer at the beach and everywhere! They're super cute and exactly as shown in the picture. I get a lot of compliments on them! I'm purchasing the black ones soon.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter-in-law from her wishlist. It looks adorable on her and she loves it!
5.0,"I have been looking for a smaller size mask for a long time because the standard ones are too big for my face. These come in 2 sizes and I purchased the small size. They fit perfect for my  size face and do not look big at all. Finally! It was embarrassing wearing the standard size masks because they were just too big for my smaller face. I highly recommend these for those of you with the same issue I have. Good product, and the design looks great."
5.0,I like darker shades and this is pair is great! Very light and adorable. Need to order another pair because my preteen claimed them as hers.
5.0,Fabulous dress!
5.0,"Bought this for my son, he's in love with it, going back to buy another one, wirth the money, you can see that this company is very detail in their products."
5.0,Good quality. Great support and flexibility.

5.0,Got this for my sister and she loves it. Fits true to size.
5.0,Who wouldn‚Äôt love to have a chance to have the icon of love???They are well made and the choice of finishes made it a wonderful personal gift!!
5.0,This dress is beautiful. I received so many compliments in this dress! I had a baby 3 months ago and haven't quite made it back to pregnancy size yet but this dress makes my waist look small! Love it!
5.0,After the gains and sweating I needed a shirt that can keep me cool and not way me down! This is perfect I even ordered more!
5.0,These house shoes are perfect for little ones. The inside sole is very soft and comfortable. The material is also soft so if you have a little one who is sensitive to materials this isn't rough in any way. The back is designed to make it so the slippers don't come off while they are walking. I bought these for my 1 almost 2 year old and they were a smidge big but because of the way the back is designed they don't slip off when he walks which is perfect if you are like me and prefer to buy a little big so they have room to grow into them.
5.0,Beautifully executed product. Great quality . My daughter loves these ! Can't wait for her to use them Product was packed well and shipped quickly. Highly recommended seller. Great products!
5.0,"These socks are soooooo soft and comfy. They keep my feet warm in the gross winter weather without getting itchy or sweaty. I've also noticed less foot odor, even after a long day with my feet stuffed into boots!"
5.0,The quality was great! The sweater was very well made and I was surprised and pleased.
5.0,I use the facemask for work and I use them for other places they going around town instead of the other cheap ones these they work excellent I have not had any problems getting sick or anything from that what‚Äôs going on now and our days in the future so thank you a lot for the masks  Amazon I will still shop for more if I need more but right now I‚Äôm good but they‚Äôre really awesome I recommend it to anyone and everyone because they‚Äôre good and they had to work with they are supposed to work for and they were really good to know cause it works when you are coughing it does not go thru easy from the mask and so thank you so much for a good quality outside keep up the great work you do a great job at your workplace keep it up stay safe everyone in the USA and the world.
5.0,Lleg√≥ r√°pido y lo puse en mi pulsera de pandora
5.0,Super cute for my gf
5.0,Have only had it a month but it has been just what I needed. Use it everyday for work to hold my badge and it gets a fair amount of abuse in my bag and shows no damage.
5.0,It's amazing what an inch or two of extender can do to make a bra more comfortable!
5.0,"Dress is very pretty and fits well. The fabric is somewhat thin, but is nice overall."
5.0,This was my after wedding dress. It fit like a dream & i felt like a princess! A petticoat made it flare perfectly
5.0,"I use it to hold my keys and my iphone 4s during my runs. One morning, I stuffed my keys and my iphone into it and started a four mile run. When I finished, I reached for my phone and realized I had not zippered the SPIbelt shut -- yet everything was still securely in place and had not fallen out! I was thankful AND impressed. Not only does the SPIbelt hold everything with a good fit that doesn't bounce around on a run, it holds everything securely."
5.0,Nice snake ring to accessorize my Cleopatra costume and even better price.  My girls want to wear it to school!
5.0,We needed a costume for school.  This was perfect and our son can wear it for dress up play at home as well.
5.0,They are surprisingly better quality than expected.  Wish I would have ordered a couple more pairs
5.0,Looks small but fits just fine.
5.0,These wool mittens were very nice and warm. My mother loved them!

5.0,"I love the soft material of this shirt as well as the loose, casual fit. The print is very unique/fun and I'm excited to wear it as the weather gets warmer!<br /><br />/Users/Shelby/Downloads/IMG_4069.JPG"
5.0,I love the style of the dress but wrinkle very easily
5.0,Great costume piece. Very sturdy and fit was good.
5.0,Really nice glasses for the money
5.0,My daughter loved it! It was her favorite Christmas gift!
5.0,I thought the material would be more wispy - but that's okay.
5.0,"Love the color! Very sturdy and cute, the pink are especially eye catching and you can never go wrong with a nice pair of black shades!"
5.0,It was as advertised.  I really love it.
5.0,Pineapple watch is super cute!
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this up and tried it on. It is just what I was looking for as a plus size girl wanting to wear a bathing suit that I didn't need to use a cover up with. The drop sleeve falls perfectly on my arm, hiding the little bit of arm fat I didn't want to parade around showing. I was shocked at how well the padded push up bra supported my boobs without any underwire in it (that's hard to come by when you have larger girls to hold up in a bathing suit). It also really helps that you can adjust the straps to give you the lift you need. The bottoms fit well too and the set looks great together. I did buy a pair of swim pants to pair this with since I am not comfortable with my big legs being on display. Bought the size xxl and as of right now it fits great, but if I lose anymore weight it will probably be too big to wear. For size reference I am 5'5, 260 lbs, xl tops/t-shirts, 18/20 jeans, 40D bra size. I am very much a pear shape with more hips, thighs, and butt than I know what to do with. Hope this review helps!"
5.0,Looks good with just about anything üòç
5.0,You did a great job 5 star feedback
5.0,"Great sandals, very comfortable."
5.0,"These boots are even cuter in person, they are adorable! I bought them for my 6 year old Granddaughter and as she had a huge smile on her face said ""These are so stylish MoMo"" (grandma). Since then she wears them almost daily and finds them to be very comfortable."
5.0,"I was a little sceptical of ordering these but im really glad I went ahead and got them. They are sturdy, comfortable, and fit perfectly. Cant beat the price!"
5.0,I‚Äôve had lots of compliments on this dress.

5.0,My husband loves these. They make his legs feel and feet feel better for his long work shifts.
5.0,"Works well, good quality"
5.0,Great item to purchase when trying to get a child to put the ball in the hoop.  The height is adjustable and prepares a child to put the ball in a taller hoop.
5.0,Belt quality is good.i l recommend it.
5.0,Plan to get a lot of use out of this
5.0,"The tie is very good quality, I got it as a replacement for my son‚Äôs school uniform tie. It matches the French toast school uniform plaid tie with a little difference. It is long not like the one size the other company offer. He is 10 years old and fits really good."
5.0,"I adore it! It's super cute in person and larger than I thought it would ""bee"". Comes with a gold color chain that can be adjusted - in my picture here I'm wearing it on the biggest/widest setting, with the lobster clasp on the furthest-out link."
5.0,I've been wearing this every day since valentines day. Love this necklace. It does shine and sparkle. Can wear it with almost anything.
5.0,"It's perfect for this Southern summertime heat, super breathable, and my daughter absolutely loves the colors :)"
5.0,These lights sold out very fast at my son's elementary school's spirit shop. All the kids thought they were cool and being relatively inexpensive they sold out very fast. All the lights worked too! I only wish I had purchased more. The shipping was very quick too. I highly recommend this item and seller.
5.0,great fit.. son loves it.
5.0,"Bought 2 as gifts, keeping one, love them."
5.0,"Easy to insert, bendable enough to clamp shut"
5.0,"This is a rally nice jacket for the price.  The zipper is on the wrong side - so every time I put it on I do a double take.  But the quality is amazing.  I think it's discontinued - so the a great price.  Fabric is good, pockets reflectors, and has a built in back pad.  Really nice."
5.0,"It was smaller than I anticipated.  However, the details are beautiful and it will be perfect as a pendant. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

5.0,"Gorgeous, well made, and exactly what I wanted."
5.0,I bought this necklace as a gift for my granddaughter.  It is extremely pretty and she really liked it.
5.0,I really love these plugs! They do run a little bit small. I‚Äôm at 5/8ths and unfortunately I have to let my ears shrink up a bit before I can wear them. The flare is small so it doesn‚Äôt feel secure. But they stay in my ears and are comparable to other glass plugs I own.
5.0,Fit my 6 year old granddaughter to a tee..She is quite petite and fit well. Would recommend
5.0,It's a pleasure to have this keyring.
5.0,I like fit and feel of the jacket.
5.0,My favourite type of shirts
5.0,Hubby loves his ring. He uses it when he goes to work (on an Ambulance). His wedding ring is made of unbreakable material so I was worried he might get injured. He is a huge 49ers fan so this ring was perfect.
5.0,i loved the colours
5.0,The company even provided the tools required to remove links to the band.  The tools worked as advertised.
5.0,Very nice just as pictured
5.0,I got it for my husband! It‚Äôs really nice

5.0,Great statement necklaces. I get lots of compliments. Makes any plain out fit unique.
5.0,Love this great for back fat And sit my girls up
5.0,"I dont like the behind-the-neck sunglass holders and these do the trick when you need your glasses to stay put.  They take a few times to get used to feeling the rubber behind your ears, but do the trick. Highly recommended."
5.0,It is a really nice fitted dress just as pictured. The material was very comfortable and exactly as it looks in the photos. I personally would prefer a more silky fabric but this one was very stretchy and nice so no complaints from me!
5.0,"I originally bought this same watch but with the brown band, black face, and in gold.  I love the watch.  First off, the product comes to you packaged like my more expesive watches have come.  In a nice box around a watch pillow.  Inside it had the instructions on how to set the time and date, a 12 month product warranty, and a voucher for a free watch. (This is the free one I picked)  I contacted their customer service to see if it was some kind of scam, I couldnt believe they were going to give me a free watch.  It wasnt, the  customer service is amazin as well.  They got back to me almost immediatley.  All I had to do to recieve a product code for a free watch was like their facebook page and post a picture of me wearing the watch on my facebook.  Done and done!  The watch fits my wrist perfectly.  The precision of the second hand and the minute hand are perfect.  The band smells of quality leather and I have recieved compliments on it already.  I will be returning for more of these inexpensive but high quality watches and I highly recommend them."
5.0,Very sturdy and stylish. Perfect kids sunglasses that look great and can survive the bottom of a backpack or beach bag.
5.0,Nice product - size fits well - use for playing golf
5.0,So beautiful and it looks just like the one in the picture. Shipping was really fast. Fell in love with it. Worth the money. My big oversized sunglasses fit perfectly. Thank you so much.
5.0,"Loving this Kipling Nyrie Bag! Plenty of room and extremely lightweight! I use this as a overnight bag. Easy to pack and carry. I can fit my clothes, my Kipling Aiden toiletry bag and my iPad Pro 10.5 , along with a few additional essentials. The strap is easily adjusted to crossbody, shoulder or tote whatever your carry needs may be. Same Great Kipling workmanship."
5.0,"I usually wear a Medium, but I ordered a large because I wanted a baggier fit. These are super comfortable and I love them. Going to order the gray pair as well."
5.0,Just received these and they're great! Look just as pictured and they are great quality and variety for the price.
5.0,Loved the sparse. Great value for the money!
5.0,"Got them for my girlfriend and she is thrilled with them! Scored some major points with these. Plus they're super fashionable, glad I got them before the trend blows up."
5.0,"After 5 years of being an old (!) Navy Officer assigned to the Marines, I finally had enough of sleeping on the ground with only an iso-mat during field exercises. Just got back after sleeping on this cot every night for two weeks and am absolutely happy. This combined with a decent inflatable pad was almost as good as my bed. No painful spots in my shoulders and hips while I slept, far less stiff in the morning. It was easy to set up and break down and fit perfectly in the standard issue 2-man tents we are assigned.<br />My only knock on it was that one leg had a tendency to fold in every so often. Not all the time, but it could be annoying.<br />Recommended this to all my other fellow service members while we were away."
5.0,"i love everything about this leggings! design is nice, i love the fabric! so soft! and ofcourse love the fit and the pockets on the side! plus it is not expensive!!!"
5.0,"Nice hat, holding up great.  Son loves to wear it!!!"
5.0,Exactly as pictured and Very cute!
5.0,Impressed with the quality of this set of shoulder pads.  They fit nicely on my shoulders and attach well to my bra straps to keep them in place.  I will definitely purchase these again when the need arises.
5.0,"Excellent product, fits really well. It is somewhat thin, but thats why it's so versatile."
5.0,Perfect match for the necklace I had that was too short. Loved that it came in a three pack so I could choose which length worked best.
5.0,GREAT WATCH! VERY STYLISH AND OF COURSE IT'S A SEIKO !
5.0,"It's tough realizing that you need to wear reading glasses (especially when you spend a lot of time on the computer)!<br />So, I appreciate the quality of the anti-glare, anti-reflection - Computer and Reading glasses.  The frames and lens are durable and help me complete my tasks.  The different colors and the reasonable cost of two pairs allows me to have this tool available and accessible in dual locations."
5.0,Sturdy and good looking  hook to hang my indoor plants
5.0,Arrived on time. Wore them on vacay to the beach. Perfect.
5.0,"The necklace is beautiful. The pearls have a good sheen and are white, which I like. I initially bought a string of pearls from another store on Amazon and returned them. These are definite keepers. They are very well made and unique in design."
5.0,Keeps jewelry from the dark color that normally silver or gold can become from the use or after save it for a long time.

5.0,"I've had these for about a month now and they're holding up well. They're comfortable enough to wear all day out of the box, though I have added an insole for arch support."
5.0,"Love this hat, looks just  the picture!"
5.0,this is awesome! thank you
5.0,It just beautiful and fun. It will make you feel special when you put it on.
5.0,"The shirt fit as expected out of the package and after the first wash and hot press.  However, these shirts tend to shrink slightly around the neck after about 3 to 4 washes and press.  I would recommend buying a 1/2 size higher in the neck.  Other than the slight shrinkage, the shirts are great for the money.  I own three of them and they‚Äôre holding up great!!!  I will definitely continue to buy them in the future..."
5.0,"This top came faster than I expected. Love the color, nice and soft and fits great."
5.0,I love the cut out shows just a little skin. fit is ok  .Very cute
5.0,The scarves were of high quality and much enjoyed during the holiday season - having arrived quickly and well wrapped.
5.0,It added something special to my bathroom
5.0,I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù with long legs and these joggers were a little too short for me (hit above ankle) so I am returning them. Otherwise the quality seemed good and they were soft and comfortable. I wish they were just an inch or so longer.
5.0,"Awesome product, 100% recomended"
5.0,Great quality material and fit great.  My son love it!  Just wished the Saints won!
5.0,"Great quality for the price, look just like photo"

5.0,I love the feel of the material.  It is a perfect summer dress.
5.0,My daughter love this as Christmas gift. She wears it every day
5.0,Arrived fine thanks barb
5.0,"Just beautiful !  The photo on amazon does not do this very beautiful necklaces justice. they are are stunning in every-way. I got these on a lightening deal and so happy I got in on that. They are very, very pretty. The chains are as other posts say. maybe 18 inches but I will still wear them . To beautiful and perfect cut not to. If you hesitate all... that is too long. Just buy  and I bought both the blue and champagne ."
5.0,Very nice well constructed. Received many compliments.  For the price I couldn‚Äôt ask for more.
5.0,"They're super stretchy and comfortable. Light weight, breatheable, and the quality is amazing. I love them so much and wear them all the time."
5.0,"I love this dress!! Fabric is super soft.  Bought in a medium, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and about 150. I typically wear a med or size 8-10 and I could have comfortably ordered this in a small.  In fact, I plan on ordering in a few different colors and will order a small."
5.0,Got this just in time to head to the beach it was light weight and fit perfect size. The color made it easy to see my son on the beach.
5.0,"Love these so much. So cute and the design is on both sides so they are reversible to fit on either hand. Perfect for spring, fall, and milder winter days.  And I love the price."
5.0,just in time for winter cold
5.0,The shirt is perfect for golf on hot days.  It states cool and when the temp is over 100*. We spray the sleeves with water !! Wonderful
5.0,"I bought these bike shorts to have as second pair to compensate for the increased riding I am doing this year. They are of the same good quality and workmanship (stitching, material, etc.) as the more expensive pair I already own - in fact the padding insert is identical except for the color. These shorts fit wonderful, the material is soft and quite breathable. I usually wear somewhere between a large and extra-large for these types of clothing - I went with the extra-large for these shorts as about 1/4 of the reviews claimed they ran a little small. The fit is perfect, tight (as they should be) with feeling restrictive. On the bike the shorts do their job - the padding adds much needed comfort for the longer rides - I used them for the first time today on a 20+ mile ride. The &quot;ZITY&quot; logo on the thigh of one leg is reflective - looks good too! This product was provided to me at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br /> Mens 3D Gel Padded Bike Shorts Black X-Large ..."
5.0,This dress fits perfectly. Ordered a large.
5.0,Great socks for your nearest and dearest wicked witch.

5.0,Loved it just what I wanted and was looking for.

5.0,Four stars.
5.0,Product came early. Has hole for breathing out of your nose and small holes for the mouth which are not visible. Perfect for my day of the dead costume!
5.0,"The jersey is wonderful, my grandson is going to love it."
5.0,WOW!!! My ring was SO shiny after using this! I love that it is super easy to travel with too. This is worth every cent.
5.0,Socks are comfy and cute. I get compliments every time I wear them. Buying a second pair!
5.0,The dress was perfect for my Power Point presentation.
5.0,I love these. They are definitely super comfortable and the sizing is just right.
5.0,These bracelets are beautiful I love the ones I got they fit me well but I do have a small wrist I will definitely buy some more of these around the holiday
5.0,Love this dress! I have ordered it in multiple colors. Super flowy and true to size.
5.0,"This dress has become my favorite dress! Love this sweet dress. I can dress it up or simple it down. It fits like a dream and it is reliably put together. Wash AND dry, though I tend to drip dry this so it lasts longer. Buy this one, you won't regret it! Just wish it came in more colors."
5.0,My 5 yr old loved them.
5.0,"Soooo soft, warm and comfortable. Would buy over and over. Wore it with a long sleeve shirt underneath in the snow and was fine. Would definitely recommend"
5.0,YEAHHHHH!!!! she loved them - I am so thrilled - I finally was able to get something for my Mom in law that she really liked and did not ask for the receipt!!! The best. Thank you
5.0,"Looks exactly like picture! Cute back and the leggings are very well compressed. Overall good quality & mine were 100% squat proof. LOVED IT. Yes, does accentuate down there a bit but a lot of leggings do that."
5.0,These are beautiful!  They are lightweight and perfect for dressing up a little!
5.0,"If you're looking for a statement piece to complete your outfit, look no further than this stunning cuff bracelet. My wife loves this bracelet! The rhinestone design and gold crafting create an eye-catching and luxurious look. This piece is perfect for any occasion. The beautiful colorful beads add an extra touch of elegance, highlighting the intricate craftsmanship that went into its creation. This beautiful piece of jewelry is truly one-of-a-kind and my wife says it falls in her favorite category!"
5.0,I got this for my best friends birthday. The pictures online don't so it justice.
5.0,Purchased these for my teenage son.  Way better quality than some of those bigger name brands you can get everywhere.  He says they are more comfortable too.  I already ordered more.
5.0,"Hands down, THE cutest, coolest sunglasses I've ever purchased, and that includes many expensive, designer shades! The online photos don't even do these glasses justice; they are just SO cute in person! Lightweight and super comfortable. If you buy these, you won't be disappointed!"
5.0,Came quick and Got everything that I expected to.
5.0,"I am still (somewhat...reasonably...ok BARELY) young and I like to show it while I still got it, you know what I mean!?  This dress accomplishes that! The optical nature of the lines give me an hourglass figure which I desperately need as I'm a small chested girl with no curves and short legs! This dress makes me look curvy, busty and gives the illusion that I have legs for days (spoiler alert- I have none of these things!) The material is fabulous- thick enough where a slip isn't necessary but not so thick that I'm sweating in the pit area. It's form fitting and hugs all the right spots but isn't so skin tight that you can see the outline of my body shaper through it! The colors are bright and the seams and stitching are solid. This is a well made dress that looks wonderful on its own or pairs wonderful with either nude or black heels and a blazer. I am thrilled with it. For sizing purposes I am 5'2 105 32-26-32 and a small fits perfect."
5.0,"Lovr it,perfect fit"
5.0,absolutely beautiful dress
5.0,SO THANKFUL.<br />Bought for my three year old who was having trouble sleeping. She would only sleep in her too small pj tops and stay up for hours shoving stuffed toys in her pj top for compression.<br />She wore this shirt for almost two days straight after we received it. Its easy to wash.<br />Very happy as this is one of the only products like this on amazon.
5.0,These are GORGEOUS!!
5.0,I liked the fabric and playful styling of this product as well as the affordable price.
5.0,Me quedo perfecto
5.0,I love it...It accomplishes all it is meant to do.
5.0,Cool glasses!
5.0,grandson loves the sneakers
5.0,These slippers are exactly what I was looking for...something to wear around the house. I wear size 6-1/2 and they fit perfectly. I love them. As for the lint issue that I read some complaining about...a small amount of lint came off for the first few days and I have seen nothing since. They are holding up great. I have zero complaints.
5.0,"This protective cover did a terrific job. I was extremely doubtful it would be effective, given the material, but it did a remarkable job. After seventeen days of traveling to London, Paris, and Dubai, our brand new suitcases were completely unscathed, no sign of scratches anywhere. And the wonderful color pattern elicited a number of positive comments. Surprisingly, there is no need to wash them for our next trip. These suitcase protective covers were worth every dollar and then some.  Would definitely buy them again."
5.0,Good value for price. My four granddaughters go through shoes at a tremendous rate so economy is a must. These sneakers are sturdy enough to last perhaps till the next shoe size up.
5.0,Bought as a gift for my wife. She LOVES it so much. It is very sparkly and finely detailed. So far she wants ALL of the NinaQueen animal charms. They have all been well done and adorable.
5.0,"The kiddo loves this pj set, wants to wear it every night! It's soft, fits well and hasn't faded yet with repeated washing"
5.0,Very cute!  Used with Galloween Costume!
5.0,"This is a nice, modest tank top that fits as expected, and feels super soft and comfortable. It washes well without shrinking or fading. The fabric is lightweight, but not transparent, and it can be dressed up with a skirt and jacket or down with jeans or shorts."
5.0,"Love this dress.  It's so comfortable.  I wish they had more colors.  The fit, length and size are perfect.  I ordered a small and fit great."
5.0,"I know my husband thinks these pants are cute on me! He makes positive comments every time I wear them! They have a nice fit, design, and coverage for me!"
5.0,exactly as expected. packaged appropriately and arrived in timely manor!
5.0,Love the material unfortunately I ordered it Lg thinking it would be smaller but it‚Äôs the actual size so it‚Äôs Big on me
5.0,Love it not too think soft fabric perfect for mask use and wind use.
5.0,"gift, very happy, nice material."
5.0,"Love these sunglasses!! I bought them for spring break because I didn‚Äôt want to bring my expensive ones with me. These glasses comparable to my polarized ray bans I have. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved them! I got the purple because I thought they are fun and trendy. For the price of these glasses, you really can‚Äôt beat the quality."
5.0,Sweet deal! Awesome set. Very good for the job. I wear them all the time. I'm<br />Sending the extra-big ones to a friend.
5.0,Love these very warm and comfortable. Good quality!
5.0,So easy to put on and remove
5.0,"Wow this one is pretty. I wasn't sure about it when I purchased it but when I got it I fell in love it looks great on me. The fit is great, I just went off the measurements they provide. The material and the lace is good quality.  This is one is a keeper."
5.0,The product fit very well and I received lots of compliments.
5.0,"This is my second Burei. My only complaint is that I have no idea how to pronounce Burei. My last purchase was of an automatic of which I wrote an extensive review. This is my second 5 star rating for this brand and I'm pretty particular when it comes to giving stars to watches. I have a $300.00 Seiko I wouldn't give 5 stars. In comparing this watch to others of this price point, I can say definitively that this brand blows all others out of the water in both design and quality. This is a battery operated chronograph with a Japanese quartz movement. I lost 1 second after 3 days which I believe means 1 minute every 6 months. I can more than live with that especially considering my watch collection is expansive and I usually only wear watches a day or a week at a time and I pull the crown to conserve battery when I put it back in the display case.<br /><br />This watch functions beautifully, and is very well designed and built. Even the strap is of far better quality than any other at this price point. My recommendation if you're on the fence about purchasing this brand is, &#34;Go for it.&#34; I have several more on my wish list. In my powerful, not so psychic, in no way supernatural, psychic prediction, these watches will cost in the hundreds by this time next year. Keep in mind with watches you're not only paying for quality, you're paying for the name, and this company is still trying to build a name. Albeit one I can't pronounce."
5.0,fits great!!
5.0,Stash your treasures in this tiny zipper bag. Adorable bombshell print. Tyvek. Sturdy bag stays 3 dimensional when zipped.

5.0,"For cute, adorable Christmas earrings, these are made very well.  They are so cute and are perfect in size."
5.0,"These leggings are amazing!  They have a soft lining, great color, and thick enough to avoid being see through.  If you're debating on whether to buy the three pack or the bigger set.  Go big!  Wishing I'd done it.  These are the best I've worn."
5.0,This works well for outdoor water aerobics classes in October!
5.0,Roomy. Adorable.
5.0,"Hubby rides his scooter back and forth to work, and in the early morning hours before the sun comes up, Cars can see him! it's a wonderful product for anyone who needs to be seen in the dark."
5.0,Very nice quality super cute great buy!!
5.0,Love it! Good material. Would buy again if needed.
5.0,It's way too small for my husbands head and even tight on my son so I kept it for myself and absolutely love it.
5.0,These are so cute and comfortable...I wonder if I will ever wear my wedding ring again ha!
5.0,"Nice soft cotton robe...the material is light, the length is perfect for me (5‚Äô4‚Äù)"
5.0,Works great for NY snowed winter
5.0,"This purchase was a gift for our 11 year old grandson. Therefore, I cannot speak to the fit or feel of the sock when being worn. Our grandson was happy about the jet fighters featured on these socks as he enjoys anything with this theme. As a shopper, I was very satisfied with this transaction."
5.0,I got these shoes for a Halloween costume. But I actually think they're really cute and could possibly end up wearing them out on a regular basis.

5.0,Shipped and received quicker than expected.  Fit very well.  Lightweight but not THIN.  Well made.  Ordered the black and 'orange' which is really more a beautiful pinkish coral.  Both will be comfortable and cool this summer.  Love them.  Thinking about ordering additional colors.
5.0,Husband says comfortable. Feel good on his feet. Did not use the pads.
5.0,"These are very nice. They include a hard case and cleaning cloth. Really good stylish look. I think it‚Äôs a bit much for these to say they are for women and men‚Ä¶I bought for myself (male) and they are a bit too feminine looking for me, but will make a great gift for a special lady. I recommend."
5.0,Thick and comfortable material.
5.0,Super cute!! They fit my 10 month old perfectly!
5.0,I got this for my husband. He loves it so much. It is quality made. Great value for money! I highly recommend!

5.0,as stated
5.0,"So beautiful and definitely so much better in person. Photo can‚Äôt capture how cute this is because it‚Äôs little, but if you love sloths it‚Äôs totally worth every penny."
5.0,My son bought for his nice the baby was excited loved
5.0,"It was the perfect match for a bag that I purchsed used (vintage) where the company no longer sold them. Durable, but has worn in nicely. Adjustable to perfect length to be used by me (5'3&#34;) and husband (6'0&#34;) both as a crossbody style on a briefcase. Would buy again!"
5.0,"Fits well, comfortable, good color, good price, and<br />delivered promptly."
5.0,"The pin is very attractive and exactly what I wanted.<br />  My order was shipped in a barely padded envelope and as would be expected it was smashed flat.  The clasp wouldn't even come off.  That being said, customer service was excellent and I received a replacement within a week.  Surprisingly, it too was in an envelope.  Guess I was lucky."
5.0,It's a tight fit and doesn't look like the picture in the product.

5.0,I really like this! Perfect.
5.0,"This is so comfy, love the color, and I get so many compliments on it! Perfect for summer. I recommend hang drying it because your dryer will mess up/tangle the tassels."
5.0,A beautiful iridescent pendant that holds its reflective charm against the skin and in any light.
5.0,"I bought this watch about a year ago, and it still looks brand new. All the other watches I've owned ended up scratched or chipped in the first few months, but this one is in perfect condition. I have no doubt it will remain that way for a long time to come.<br /><br />Great product!"
5.0,This is the softest nightgown ever.

5.0,Very sexy and beautiful.<br />I did read the reviews and went a Cup size up and fits perfectly. Like the diamond pendant dangling. Also panties was perfect fit.
5.0,I am really pleased with this ring thus far. I wanted a ring that I could wear when we're outdoors or traveling that I wouldn't be constantly worrying about losing so I ordered this and am really happy I did!<br /><br />I find it really comfortable on my finger and I haven't had a problem with it rubbing the insides of my other fingers. It's lightweight in that it doesn't feel heavy on my finger (sometimes I forget it's there) but it's not lightweight enough that it feels cheaply made.<br /><br />I wear a size 5 so that's what I ordered and find it to fit true to size.<br /><br />I will say that it took about 12-14 days to arrive but if you're not in a hurry or plan accordingly that shouldn't be a problem. I'm really happy with it and would definitely order another.<br /><br />I was provided this product free or at a discount for my honest unbiased review. These opinions remain unaffected by that fact and are my honest opinions and experience with this product.
5.0,These watches are really gorgeous . I received every color in the picture not one was missing . My lady has a watch fetish with these watches now . These watches are very colorful and vibrant .

5.0,"I bought this as a gift. It is very durable and I'm sure it will last a long time. However the person I gave it to said that even though the pockets are big enough, the tops are small. You could easily break an egg while putting it in."
5.0,"I LOVE it! It's a perfect size and I love that it has the crossbody option, because it's what I prefer.<br />Some people said they had problems with fading, but I have only had mine for a few weeks. I hope I don't have that problem."

5.0,"I began using this after having issues with what should have been a great dive.  I have long hair and hate putting it into a pony tail.  This band gave me the best of both worlds...  free flowing hair and the ability to see!  It is fully adjustable, stays on, and works well with my mask. I also enjoy the color, making my dive photos just a little more enjoyable!  This is a wonderful accessory for divers who need to tame their hair!"

5.0,My son and grandson both wear these.  They love them. I have purchased a couple of times.  Great price and great product.
5.0,"I ordered 2 and both arrived quickly with all of their stones in place. Time will tell if they stay in place but for now they look great! There was a plastic film that I had to remove on both sides of the locket. It did look scratched until I removed the protective film. It‚Äôs very hard to tell the film is even there so it would be easy to think the glass is scratched. I added a few red and blue tiny gemstones I purchased elsewhere and used a silver chain I already had but loved that it came with 3 charms and a necklace I can keep as a backup. Overall, great value!"
5.0,Good quality simple but cute
5.0,Fit great. Love the material.
5.0,"My daughter asked for a melon hat.  I thought I was ordering a melon hat.  It turns out I didn't order Melon.  She took the hat to Alaska, and she loves it.  She says everyone there is wearing the same hats!"

5.0,beautiful! nice material
5.0,"Re-review, having had this watch a while now, it still works great. Has been battered and scratched by animals and walls alike , while surface blemishes are present the watch itself works great.

5.0,This is. My favorite belly button ring I‚Äôve ever had. All the other ones are not long enough and get super rusty quick‚Ä¶ not this one this is my favorite of all time
5.0,This dress shows the right amount of sexy but most comfortable to move around in. I‚Äôm obsessed with the silver shine it gives my look! I‚Äôve even worn this with heels or a solid shoe for edginess.

5.0,I love the bag. It has a nice quality feel to it and the stitching and quality make of the bag gives me confidence it will hold up to the abuse of being apart of my wildand firefighting gear.

5.0,"Again, Orthofeet comes thru'. I've had lots of slippers but none as comfortable as these. I love the adjustability."
5.0,"I ordered these silicone rings for myself after getting my husband a set.  He's a mechanic and really needs them.  I do a lot of house work..both inside and out.  I ordered a 6....i'm between and 6 and 7......The 7 would have been too big......but the 6 seems to cause this little fat roll to show on my finger...lol...I know...it's not biggie...just saying!<br /><br />I like how they feel....it's like you aren't wearing a ring.  I've gardened in it today...washed the dishes...lifted weights....all with ease.  The water dries fast under the ring after I wash my hands.<br /><br />If you are active like me....these rings are for you.  I haven't tried any other brands but Tera Armor so far.....my daughter in law felt of them and told me they were equal quality to hers...and she gave a lot for her one ring....and I received a pack for less....she plans on ordering her some from Tera Armor now.<br /><br />I did receive these rings at a discount for my honest opinion.  If you found my comments helpful, please vote."
5.0,Great price and comfortable.  Relatively easy install.
5.0,It is beautiful and comfy. Small is a little bit short for me. But I guess for a younger girl is just fine. It is a must have this season with long boots or chunky sneakers when gets warmer
5.0,I love this dress. I'm so glad I took a change and got it. It fits great and is so comfortable.
5.0,"I ordered a large for my figure and the fit is great except the waist is a little small, not uncomfortable though, and I can get them on. I am not going to complain about that issue because I am just built different with no real waist and smaller in the hips and thighs.  I really like the weight of the jeans, perfect for our hot and humid weather here in the south."
5.0,Cute and I love the higher neckline
5.0,"The design is unique and it perfectly fits to my head. Sun is out and too much hot here so to protect my head looking for good design, light weight and soft hat. This one has all those qualities. The stitches are proper and you won‚Äôt find any threads are out or any cheap materials. Super happy"

5.0,Best and most durable quality cap I have bought on Amazon. Color did not change despite washing it every week for last 18 months. I love it and got so many compliments. I wish they had other colors.
5.0,"This dress is so pretty! I love the material, made of 86% Acrylic, 14% Polyester . I know is not that cold yet but I am thinking of wearing it during Fall time here in my area. I am 5'2 and weight 115 so I ordered size XS. It fits a little big but I think it is the model and cut of the dress. I like the combination of grey and white. You can wear it with boots, flats or booties."
5.0,"The shirts are pretty thick, soft, and the bow accent is just the perfect delicate touch."
5.0,Good quality and looks great on meüëç
5.0,Thank you so much!! My daughter is over the moon excited!!! Perfect addition to her costume!!
5.0,These face covers provide excellent protection while looking good too.  The item is re-useable due to being able to change the filters.  I ordered more filters to use.  Love this product.
5.0,Love the dress well made and fast shipping
5.0,very pretty and doesn't irritate my very sensitive ears.
5.0,"I don't wear shoes inside the house, so easy-on, easy-off is essential. I wanted something that was easy to  put in the shoe, functioned well, and looked,  well, like they belonged in an adult pair of shoes. Many lace alternatives look a bit juvenile or clunky. I put these in my Converse All Stars, (I know, not the epitome of mature footwear, but still...) and they definitely fit the bill. They work well, look sleek, and were a breeze to put in the shoe. They aren't tight enough for a running shoe, but for everyday wear they will work just fine. One note: if I had a a narrow foot, I  would want the next size smaller. Next time I order some, I hope that they have a wider selection of lace colors, or that I could choose from different colors of aglets, although I do like the red in these shoes."
5.0,I use these outside when I have clean hair and want to keep it that way. Well made and I love the design
5.0,Great fitting socks!!
5.0,Love this dress! True to size. I ordered my normal size in the navy blue and it fits perfect. Its very loose and flowy. It is longer on the front left side of the dress but i think it looks cute. You can  wear it out and also as a night gown.  I am ordering more colors
5.0,"omg I am so in love with my necklace, I have not taken it off since I got it! It holds such a special message for me! It has not tarnished or changed colors! Nothing! I love it!"
5.0,The size I ordered was too big for my son and the remote doesn't work when I received the item. I contacted the seller and they quickly resolved our problem! I'm waiting for the replacement shoes right now. I'm very happy and so is my son! The shoes are great and definitely catches attention. My son is very excited!
5.0,Seems to be well made.  Easy to use
5.0,"Got these for all my niece's! Perfect, love them!"
5.0,This glasses is excellent for night driving. I am not struggling to see at night and do not have watery eyes anymore. I have 20/20 vision which means I have good vision. These anti glare glasses help because it does not strain my eyes or cause headaches.
5.0,"Looks great, works great with 24mm leather band. I would buy another if I wanted to get an additional band (another leather or metal) just because it'd be easier than switching them out with just one set of the adapters."
5.0,These are good. The plugs are easy but the tapers are heavy and weigh down the ears
5.0,I bought this to be part of a Rainbow Brite costume for my daughter.  The quality is excellent and the sizing seems accurate.  Love the blue color.  This will be great for dance and gymnastics the rest of the year.
5.0,"It's stylish, adjustable with velcro, easy to store when traveling.  It serves it's purpose very well.  I'm glad I purchased this sun viser."
5.0,"Great nightie, exactly as advertised.  Arrived quickly.  Very comfortable to wear"
5.0,"I bought a black pair,  then months later 3 more pairs in different colors once i found how comfy they are. I wore the charcoal pair for the first time today to a TOB conference and got two complements on them. I feel so good wearing them. $69 is a lot of money for a pair of slacks, but oh, they fit perfectly for my 5‚Äô8‚Äù body."
5.0,I wanted to make sure it stood up to the swimming and shower test and it does! This necklace is 100% sterling silver and won‚Äôt turn green after it‚Äôs wet. Perfect size to wear layered with other necklaces. Would buy again!
5.0,Son tallas muy peque√±as.

5.0,This is just like the photo.  It is the right size for a necklace or charm bracelet
5.0,"Had to keep taking off my safety glasses and putting on my readers,these glasses solved that problem.  Thank you."

5.0,Came back n the mail fast. Love them.
5.0,"This is the first watch I've bought in probably 10 years. I wanted something: simple yet elegant, formal yet functional, casual yet classy. This watch hits all of those perfectly. The build quality is superb. I've worn it for a couple weeks now and it shows no signs of wear or tear.<br />As for keeping time accurately, as far as I can tell it does that very well.<br />I have a smallish wrist and wear the watch at the second to last hole. The leather band is soft and comfortable against the skin."
5.0,Love the my purchase
5.0,My grandson loved his pajamas
5.0,"This wearable blanket is very warm, and very comfortable to wear. While there are several sizes available, they're all intentionally oversized for the specified ranges with wide hems, so that you can curl your legs up underneath easily. With the hoodie on, you can keep your entire body warm head to toe!<br /><br />The side-opening pocket is a plus - nice and deep, although not zippered or buttoned so don't be surprised if things fall out while you're rearranging yourself into a comfortable position. Note - while the images show a top flap with buttons, giving the impression of a top-closure pocket, there's no actual opening in the top. I can't really figure out what the flap is for; it doesn't seem to serve any purpose other than design/decoration.<br /><br />Can't speak to durability yet, but it does seem well-constructed. Will update further if needed, but highly recommended for now!"
5.0,Super cute and stretchy so you can actually pull them up however high you want. I have medium/ thick thighs so this is always an issue with normal cotton socks but these are great. And super cute.
5.0,love the look of these! so cute easy to put on. only thing is I wish they were shorter so that they looked better with pants. they are too tall to really wear to school because he can't get pants to pull over these
5.0,My favorite gloves for warm weather gardening. The 10-pk was a great deal!
5.0,Great socks that don‚Äôt slip. I wear them all day and don‚Äôt have to adjust at all!

5.0,its very slender GOOD QUALITY and easy to get in and out of my purse quickly
5.0,The V neck doesn't come down to far if you're worried about modesty. Its a great for your waist. You necessarily don't need to wear spank or anything under it. It fits as expected. I ordered a 3X and it was a roomy but still comfortable.
5.0,Only downsize is the bracelet is bigger than expected.
5.0,"I bought these laces for some LL Bean Chukka boots so I could use them as slip-ons.  The laces are a bit longer than called for per the boot size, but in all other respects they're doing a great job.  I didn't comment on the questions referring to the Unisex Sneakers for obvious reasons."
5.0,Loved the way it fit my daughter. Material was very very good. Extremely satisfied!

5.0,"This is an excellent satchel. It shows no wear in daily use and not a stitch has come undone since I bought this in early 2016.<br />I don't know how I got along without this satchel before I bought it. Oh yes, now I remember, I was always asking<br />my wife to hold this or that in her bag. It became a pain to both of us.<br />I keep my EpiPen in it, my wallet, other little things that make life a little more comfortable for having them around.<br />The wrap around zipper on the outside does add quite a bit of room to the bag, it became the perfect size<br />as I suspect you will find more use for it than you at first imagined. At least that was my experience with it.<br />I'm glad I followed through on my wife's idea. She's a smart lady."

5.0,"These frames fit over large prescription glasses. They are sturdy enough, I occasionally use them when riding my motorcycle without a problem (apart from fitting all 4 branches under the helmet).<br />I had a pair of these for a couple of years before misplacing them and ordered 5 pairs (one for each car). Can't live without them. A must have if you live in a sunny state. Excellent quality, extremely light."

5.0,"Very soft and comfortable dress! The color is exactly as shown in the picture, material is soft, stretchy and not too thin (but wouldn't want it any thinner), and you can't go wrong with a dress with pockets. I'm 5'5&#34; and it skims the ground but not so much that I trip over it or need to hem it. Its exactly what I was hoping for."
5.0,"These are clear glasses, very comfortable to took through for the eyes (unlike some yellowish Foster Grants I owned previously). The frame also fits my face structure very well, I tend to forget I am wearing them. The color is black and the frames feel well made, sturdy and not flimsy at all. I was not disappointed at all."
5.0,"AMAZING!!! These are so frikkin pretty I can't even believe it! For the price they are a steal of a deal! In person at a shop they would be VERY expensive. I HIGHLY recommend that you buy these!

5.0,My wife loved the shirt and it fit as expected.  Would definitely buy again!
5.0,"This is a beautiful Tux shirt.  I love the black studs and they fit the button holes just right.  I purchased a shirt a size larger than I normally take because I have long arms.  The arm length is perfect so if you have long arms, I would recommend going up a size.  The body of the shirt is baggy and not as fitted because I had to go up a size but it still is and awesome shirt.  I would much rather have a shirt a little large than tight fitting.  I would recommend this shirt.  I purchased it for a woman's tux but it will look fabulous with jeans as well."
5.0,love this purse.
5.0,"I love it! I'm 6ft, 195lbs. I thought it would be super short, but it was just a little above my ankle. I ordered a large, fit perfect! You do have to lace it yourself, and it's slightly see through, but not to bad. Lol! This was the only pic I had!"

5.0,Just what I was looking for.  Super comfortable and absorbant.  Shipped very quickly.
5.0,Love the masks.  Nice how they are reversible
5.0,"I cannot say enough good about this dress!  For reference, I'm 5' tall, weigh about 123 lbs and bought the xsmall and it was perfect! It was even short enough that I could wear flats with it without much trouble, which is basically like finding a unicorn for a short person buying a maxi dress!  I got so many compliments when I wore it that I lost count.  If you're looking for something a little different that is really gonna make a statement, get this dress!  My nephew even told me it was ""dope"" which apparently is high praise. ;)"
5.0,"Wonderful soft material , washes without shrinking .  My neuropathy is not bothered by them , they don't bunch up or have any bulky seams ."

5.0,"a bit tricky to figure out because of poor instructions, but a very good basic pilot's watch"
5.0,"Well made with a fine knit and vibrant color.  This hat really pops.  It's slightly large for my hat size 7 head with a buzz cut, but I realize my size is on the small end of the spectrum.  It's also on the thin size, but has a tight weave.  Good for above freezing temperatures and my head doesn't get hot.  Overall, it's a solid hat with great color in a sea of black and gray."
5.0,"I love the color and the quality. The paws are interestingly upside down. And the ears don't stay up while wearing. Otherwise, it's worth the price."
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. I will be buying more because these are the best. I don‚Äôt know why I haven‚Äôt bought these sooner

5.0,Girlfriend loved them.
5.0,"Nothing bad to say about these shorts. I'm 5'6"" and 125 pounds. I bought a medium and these fit really well. I feel mobile in them. They are a nice length on me as well. I did feel itchy even just while trying them on when they first arrived. I'm hoping that's something that will pass after a few washes. Other than that, the material is smooth, soft, and comfortable. I'm not somebody who needs pockets, but they do unexpectedly come in handy when out and about."
5.0,Great product for the $.
5.0,"I got the tie-dye pink , size M. I absolutely Love the lock! But it‚Äôs a thin material you can see through it. The bright color is there, can‚Äôt come plain about that.  Wish I got size L  to achieve that baggy T-shirt  look.  I‚Äôm 5 ft 5‚Äù and 158 Lb üò´ bust  size 34 B. üòí"

5.0,I loved the fit it is definitely true to size. So comfortable & sexy.
5.0,This is such a cute outfit and fits my daughter very well. I love that it's true batman/batgirl colors and not pinks and purples. The cape stays on pretty well and the velcro hasn't caught in my daughter's long hair so far.

5.0,"I love this!! I always question the quality of items like this but honestly,  the fabric feels great and isn't see through. Sizing is true- I'm 5'3"", 150 lbs and I ordered a L bc I wanted it to drape a little like it does on the model. I love the fit- it's adorable."
5.0,Took a chance and gave this watch to my husband as a early fatherr's day gift... And I'll tell you...He absolutely LOVES this watch!!! He couldn't stop looking at it! The band is beautiful and it looks very expensive. I just ordered the black one for him also. Just hope they don't give him future problems.<br /><br />If you're thinking about purchasing it...DO IT! Great buy!!
5.0,It is soft and light to the touch. It enhances the colors in the dress I'm wearing to my son's wedding. I couldn't be any more excited with this purchase.<br />I wish that there had been washing/care directions in English.

5.0,Comfortable and warm enough to wear year round.
5.0,"Totally love this belt. Not having to deal with holes or a specific size in a belt is fantastic. It's easy to setup. Just cut it, attach the buckle and you're off. I highly recommend this."
5.0,"Wonderful fit, snug but easy to get on"
5.0,"Love this belt!! Trendy at the moment, good quality leather, heavy solid buckles, very well made. Looks as it is in the pictures. Make sure when you order to measure your waist or wherever you plan to place the belt when worn and check the circumference of the belt :)"

5.0,It's a great summer dress!
5.0,SO COOL ! LOVE IT !
5.0,"That neck less I bought is pretty darn awesome, I have any clue what the symbol means or the lettering. But I like, it's very Fancy!!!! But only but this if your into Japanese or other Asian accessories. Like Paper Lanterns, Dragon Decorations, or any Type of bracelet or Jewels. This for Five or six bucks was a good deal."
5.0,"Bought this for my daughters 30th birthday.  She absolutely loved them.  Much nicer in person, the picture does not do it justice.  Good size also, thought it was smaller from the picture but was pleasantly surprised that it was a substantial size when I received it.  Thinking of ordering in other colors =)"
5.0,Nice quality right size
5.0,"They're great, They might not be polarized but they're great at blocking the sun while i'm riding my bike. They're not too tight or rough around the ears like many other pairs i used. Fogging is never an issue when i'm riding and breaking out a good sweat. I highly recommend them."
5.0,Fit<br /><br />Nothing disliked
5.0,Love love love the material of this shirt!! It is thin and very light and was just what I was looking for. It is softer than cotton and breathable . I will be buying more
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He LOVES it! He even likes the little coin pouch on the side. It's already been 3 months since I purchased it and it still looks great and hasn't came apart.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my friend, who is studying dental hygiene.<br /><br />She was really happy receiving these.<br /><br />Super cute"
5.0,I ordered a large and it‚Äôs been great! it has finally broken about half way in at 100 hours of use. It may slouch in the sleeve but while on your bike you notice that‚Äôs where it fits the best and the most natural. Lots of fun pockets especially if you carry protection of the steel kind. The quality is fine enough I wear it in direct sunlight like a flannel.
5.0,Wore these all day upon receipt. Feel great.  Not too much compression.  Well made and will purchase again.
5.0,Fits a little bigger than I expected. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 163lbs and it comes almost to my knees and as it‚Äôs worn it relaxes more. I don‚Äôt mind tho because it‚Äôs still a pretty awesome dress.
5.0,Perfect for smaller cups. As comfy as it gets!!

5.0,"My sons love these colorful, funky socks. They are sturdy and seem to be holding up well to teenager wear and lots of washing."
5.0,"Being a larger woman, this swimsuit is great! Material is thick and strong. I ordered a large and it fit like a glove, I plan on ordering a xl for my next one because it was a tad small. This suit so does show off the booty cheeks so if that is something you're not interested in than do not buy! I get a lot of compliments in this suit which is why I'm buying another color!"
5.0,Too cheap of quality. Doesn‚Äôt look like photo
5.0,I thought at first they were too small but tried them anyway and to my surprise they were perfect .
5.0,"I got these for my 8 year old son, and he loves them. The velcro is so nice especially when you travel or have an active lifestyle. They are cooler IRL than pictured online."
5.0,I was kind of worried when I first received these because they looked like they would only fit a child. I gave them as a gift to an adult with the intention of returning if they did not fit. The good news is they fit an adult female size 8 foot. The back of the sock looks like the back of the characters outfit and the bow poofs out also. They are really cute and were a big hit with our Sailor Moon fan.
5.0,Cute and really helpful!  I got it because I kept getting sick at work and this stone was supposed help with redirecting bad energies and so far I haven‚Äôt gotten sick!
5.0,Perfect for making dog collars.

5.0,"After my first pair of Mountain Khakis which I purchased at a retail store were woefully damaged, I went to Amazon to order my second pair and as with the first pair, I was not disappointed. In every aspect, these are some of the finest pants I've ever worn. Great quality, great look and great comfort!!! This product is well worth the price."
5.0,Official and fit true to size
5.0,"Very pretty. Appropriately small and discreet;) Perfect for imaginative play and exciting to have at home:)<br />Sand falls through almost immediately, acting as a count for each turn.<br />Shiny shiny."
5.0,So I‚Äôm a personal trainer and I‚Äôm always looking for nice tank tops and muscle shirts. I am very picky so I‚Äôm usually not happy with my purchases. These are great quality and look good.

5.0,"Great material, great design. Keeps everything in well. I am typically a standard Medium, and I exchanged the dress for a small, especially considering that there is the option to tighten/ loosen the chest area."
5.0,was a great costume I was a day of the dead bride
5.0,thank you!
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress.  It is long sleeves, a must for me.  It reaches from shoulder to ground, just the way I wanted it to.  it clings to my every curve and hides all the bulges except the one that would give me away if ZI wasn't able to tuck it in."
5.0,Got a lost of compliments lived it so pretty
5.0,"OMGosh! I am so excited about this hat!  Several years ago I bought a similar hat from a street vendor in Aruba and it has been perfect for the pool.  Unfortunately, I have worn it so much in the salt water that I am about to have to throw it out.  But I have searched for one similar to it and this one fits the bill.  I particularly love the wire, which is what I was looking for.  The last one just had wire on the edge...where this has two rings of wire.  Others are either too floppy and don't offer the sun protection, or are straw.  This one (as the other one) does fit snug, but that's what you want, right?  The other one was one was just a plain off white...so I don't know what to expect from these adorable print colors.  But I am about to find out!"
5.0,Thos is vibrant and comfortable.  It is breathable yet durable feeling fabric.  Love it!
5.0,If fit... but not comfortable fit... still a noce piece m still like to keep it
5.0,"Great boxers, they might run a little small, but overall a super product.  Very comfortable."
5.0,A gift. They liked them. Thank you!
5.0,I bought several packs of these for my child‚Äôs birthday party. Good quality for the price. I would recommend as a party favor or casual dress up. Can‚Äôt beat the price.
5.0,Great Products
5.0,Really nice set
5.0,"These hats are great! Super comfy fleece lining, and there is quite a bit of stretch so I think they would fit even bigger kids if needed. I got these for my nephews, they will be great for the upcoming cold months."
5.0,"feels nice, looks nice :)"
5.0,"This dress hides a little of the tummy many of us have developed during Covid.  Just draw the waist string and<br /> blouse the top over the waist.  It is a great summer dress...add a long necklace or a pretty scarf to dress it up a bit, a pair of sandals or even comfortable heels and you are ready for anything. They are sheer and cool...you may need a half slip.  For the price...you can't beat it!"
5.0,"Me encantaronn,,,diferentes, hermososs,lindosss colores,,,como muestran en la foto!!"
5.0,"I needed a new wallet and was looking for a high end designer leather one and could not find one that was big enough. After searching, I found this one on Amazon and I absolutely love this wallet. It‚Äôs very spacious and holds all of my cards, iPhone, passport, check book, and cash. Definitely worth it for the price."
5.0,Everything was good with item.
5.0,"When I went my religious meeting, I pinned on my vest. It attracts attention."
5.0,Very unique! I've gotten tons of compliments. It is small so you need to treat it more like a small wallet vs a purse. Very cute!
5.0,Got this for my gf and she takes it everywhere. It‚Äôs used daily
5.0,Really great bag for the price.
5.0,"My last pair of sandals ( water proof) lasted 5 years.<br />I had to stop wearing them because one of the straps broke.<br />While searching to replace them, the Megnya sandals came up.<br />When I received my sandals I was very happy with them,<br />with a great feeling like walking on foam.<br /> One problem I have is  that my  left pinky is a bit short so it gets stuck with one of the strips.<br />So I have to push my foot up.<br />Now that I have been wearing them for over a month, I have two problems.<br />One, that the foam at the top has ripped a bit.<br />Also, the sandals do smell at the end of the day.<br />I can recommend these sandals as  a fashion accessory but less as a hiking sandal."
5.0,nice spleep pants
5.0,"love it, get positive comments about the scarf all the time"
5.0,"These are great bands! They are secure, slim, and just all around wonderful. I bought the forest green to go with my rose gold watch and it is lovely together! All of the colors are rich and I will be using these for a while."
5.0,Lots of room. Not real leather but nice enough
5.0,"I had been looking high and low for shorts like these. They are so classy  and stylish for women of all ages, especially those of us who are older but  whose legs are still worth showing-off."
5.0,"These style watches are my favorite. This watch is beautiful, I have only worn it twice but so far no problems with it at all."
5.0,Amazing jersey üôåüèº
5.0,Worked great! My brand new necklace turned black but has been restored to it original beauty!!!!
5.0,"Very pretty, wear a lot with my beach summer outfits"
5.0,I think I may have to get a matching one for the other ear I like it that much and I likr hearing the little tinkle as it jingles when I shake my head and stuff.
5.0,"These look fantastic on, and so far nothing has broken or peeled off of them. I've had them for a few months now."
5.0,Slytherin House!
5.0,Easy to slip on and comfortable fit
5.0,"I really like the quality of this band , it looks amazing with my watch and its super cute ! I will be buying more bands in the future"
5.0,this is a lovely set very elegant for dressing up
5.0,"great product, arrived just as pictured!"
5.0,The mask fits.  Nicely made.  I love it.
5.0,I have another one from another company and it works great but it is little different and I needed flat one for smaller bags. I haven't tried it yet but it looks like it can't be broken into so that's good.
5.0,These are great for tired legs or restless legs. The material is a bit on the warm side. I am not sure I would use them to work out. Good as winter socks too.
5.0,My daughter loves all the colors and the fact that they are wash and wear.  She is a mom of boys and a special ed teacher so they get dirty often and she can match her band to what she is wearing.
5.0,Perfect fit. Very cute jumper. Comfortable and looks great on.
5.0,"Great shirts!! These are thin, but will definitely get the job done. I‚Äôve washed and dried them and they‚Äôve held up no stretching. I sweat a lot and they get drenched quick and can be a pain to take off but otherwise they‚Äôre great value for the price!"
5.0,Everything was as described!
5.0,The product is light weight and shapes well to your head. It has an adjustable string in the back to cinch the cap and fit it to each individual person.
5.0,Such a cute ring. I'm wearing as a thumb ring. Excellent packaging and very nicely made ring. Going to purchase several more for Christmas gifts.
5.0,"These came quick, they fit my 7 year old perfectly, and he loves the design!"
5.0,"I absolutely live these leggings. They are comfirtable and they are nicer than the traditional cotton. This is the second pair I have purchased, because I like wearing them while out and about."
5.0,love the shirt cute with jeans and boots
5.0,"Loved this dress, very comfortable and casual."
5.0,I always accessorize
5.0,Feels good on the face. Doesn't press on the eyes.
5.0,"Nice belt, good quality especially for the price. Fast shipping and arrival as well."
5.0,"I have purchased and tested every model of fan powered masks available on Amazon over the past three months, and this one is easily the most attractive and quality made units I‚Äôve seen. (See photos posted by other reviewers).  The blue LED lightbar is also an interesting touch that breaks up the monotony of yet another white mask.  The soft silicon is extremely comfortable, but I agree with other reviewers that it‚Äôs best for smaller faces. Yes, the bottom vent flaps don‚Äôt close completely but that‚Äôs totally irrelevant because the fan ensures outflow even on the lowest setting.  Im also pleased that the rechargeable lithium battery is good for many hours of use.  Overall a good buy at a reasonable price.  It sure beats the heat and discomfort of those ridiculous cloth masks and useless paper masks."
5.0,These are great for the price. Shipping was incredibly fast. They have been very durable. The clasps work great. Colors are very accurate to the description.
5.0,Muy bonita de buen material
5.0,"It was really cute. My girls still use it for dress up. The crown and wand were a little flimsy, wand broke pretty quick. Still worth the money."
5.0,"I over estimated size. I'm a 36dd bust, 5'2&#34; 150lbs. I think I could've got the large instead of xl. But because stretchy it still fits and looks good do I'm keeping it. I think it would look better with a belt but otherwise comfortable and flattering for a girl with hips like me lol."
5.0,A beautiful addition to my fishing belt buckle collection!  It also works very well too!
5.0,Lightweight and I would say it fits true to size.
5.0,They were great until they broke on me after 2 weeksü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5.0,I prefers if it was sewn and not baked but it is Ok.
5.0,"This dress is super flattering and hugs your body in all the right places. I‚Äôm on the thicker side so tight dresses can be a hit or miss but this was definitely a hit. Not to mention, you can‚Äôt beat the price!!"
5.0,My skirt is absolutemy beautiful.
5.0,Wow! I am in love. I am the maid of honor in a wedding going to wear this. It is very pretty dark navy blue. I plan on getting a blingy sash as it is a plain dress. I am 5'9&#34; and typically wear a size 4-6. I got the small thought it might be too small but it's stretchy fabric so fits perfectly
5.0,Unless you take them off and lay them down somewhere. In that case they're where ever you put them down and we know they're somewhere. Best reader glasses I have ever had. I've been using these over the last 4-5 years. I've had to replace them due to either taking them off and stepping on them or scratching the lens. I always know where they are as long as they're hanging around my neck.
5.0,"I probably have 20 pair of ToeSox, but this pair just might be my new favorites. I wear them for Pilates and Gyrotonic;  they have plenty of grippies on the bottom, and all the elastic straps make for a really secure fit.  These socks stay on and in place really well, AND they look super cute.  LOVE THEM!"
5.0,To create a set of wine and mixed drink jibbitz
5.0,The bracelet is exactly what I like delicate.
5.0,"Better than expected! I have twin girls that I ordered these for and they absolutely love them. Super cute, functional and comfortable."
5.0,Perfect add on for my Maleficent costume. It drapes around your shoulder with a satin ribbon you can tie behind you. Plenty of room to move even after tying it. Loved it!
5.0,"Nice looking belt, works great...buckle somewhat heavy"
5.0,I got an XL and I weigh 196 lbs. It fits great. The bottoms are a high rise like in the picture so great for covering up stretch marks if thats an issue for you as well.  The top is very open and could be a little revealing for a busty woman. But overall I am pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"Love the band, but things stick to it a bit more than the on that came with the watch from Apple. (Cat fur mainly) slim profile is much better than the thick one from Apple."
5.0,"Love this hat! Always get so many compliments when I wear it. I'm a female with a big head and thick hair and this hat fits perfectly! All other hats are way too tight on my head and I can barely get them on, if at all. I was a little hesitant to buy this hat since I assumed this would be too tight as well, but I am so happy I bought it! Thick haired gals, this is the perfect hat for our hair!!!"
5.0,This is well made and beautiful.
5.0,ya feel like COG soldier. nice build and look durable. this hat design new for me anyway i m satisfied.
5.0,"I have worn it several times in the Bay Area.  It is crushable, very feminine, and looks good on my head."

5.0,Really nice soft to the touch and very pretty. Love it.
5.0,"Authentic and great fit, size large!"
5.0,Fits perfect to size
5.0,I think that this is very pretty and will go with all of my sweaters....
5.0,"I purchased the blue with pink cloth sash and its a great robe.  I do wish the pocvkets were placed in front rather than on seam but other than that minor complaint, this is just a great little robe.  Very soft and perfect fit."
5.0,Fantastic and fun.  Gave it as a Christmas present to my mother and she loves it &#34;Oxytocin?&#34; So much she won't take it off.
5.0,"THIS IS ONE OF MY NEW FAVORITES! Y‚Äôall, this shirt is amazing. Super cute and flattering fit without being too clingy. It‚Äôs long enough that you can wear with leggings or dress it up with a necklace and jeans.<br /><br />I wore it out today and already received compliments. For reference I‚Äôm 120lbs, 5‚Äô3 and bought a small. Buy it, you won‚Äôt regret it!"
5.0,"This is worth the price, soft and comfortable. I bought the biggest size for my daughter 7 years old, fits her perfectly but if she is stall would suggest getting a bigger size.  Other than that it is a great buy"
5.0,I‚Äôm super satisfied with these pants I have to order another color. I would definitely recommend if you are like me and on the shorter side you definitely should wear heels but who would wear flats with these. Lol They Fit Perfect super cute high waisted
5.0,We loved these earrings! They look exactly like photo and are so dang adorable
5.0,"We bought two different sizes and colors.  We use them for sports clothes, sports equipment, and as a swim bag."
5.0,Great Gift to add to his collection
5.0,Very strong magnet. A little difficult to get the cards out initially but it's perfect after a couple months use.
5.0,Liked the color.  Nice fit
5.0,"I have used these for years and now have my daughter and friends hooked on them too.  Great for when you don't want to carry a purse but need your ID, credit cards and small amount of cash.  Just slip into your  pocket and go. Being a metal case, nothing inside gets damaged."
5.0,"These are so cute, light, and comfortable. I live in AZ and can see myself still being cool in these pants during 100 degree plus weather."
5.0,It‚Äôs a cute and fun band. Has good stretch to it and is comfortable to wear!
5.0,Stunning.
5.0,It came earlier than expected and it's beautiful!
5.0,"I love this watch. I have a nickel allergy, so I love these styles of watches - leather behind the face so I don't break out. I've had a lot of watches in this style, but this one has been my fav. The face is bigger than similar watches I've bought before. And though more costly, I think it'll last a long time."
5.0,This item fits like a glove and is truly high rise waist. Great for middle aged tummy coverage.
5.0,"As soon as I opened the package I fell I love with the dress, love the color, the texture, I wasn‚Äôt sure about the size so I went a size larger and it fit perfectly!!! Am so happy!!! The dress looks exactly like in the picture!!! Am very satisfied, thank you Amazon!!! üëçüëçüëç"
5.0,Love the fit.  Stretch makes for a very comfortable item.
5.0,"These are exactly as expected. Polarized lens, great mirror finish."
5.0,Very nice hat. It matches his pea coat. This is a good accessory for a music lover.  So my son will love it.
5.0,"I had a vein stripped at Deborah Hospital, they recommended compression tights. I am not an extra large with regular tights, but that is what fits me with compression tights. My legs feel much better with the support. I will continue to wear them."
5.0,Absolutely love this shirt.  Fit and quality are excellent.  The picture of Vladdy looks awesome too.
5.0,"I love the gloves, but the pair isn't as warm as I thought. They look great and are soft and somewhat warm. I just thought they would be warmer."
5.0,"THIS WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE CENT! All Social Media: @tshaunie to see the dress and more pictures. I did not take it off or changed and was perfect for my Bridgerton themed party! so perfect! I‚Äôm a 34D bust if that helps, 5‚Äô4, and 180lbs and the size I selected was perfect. No alternations needed."
5.0,This is a stunningly beautiful piece.  A wearable work of art.  I got the cotton it is soft and drapes beautifully.  I plan on ordering many more for Christmas.  Delivery was quick and efficient.
5.0,It came as stated in the description.  Fits perfectly to my strap.  Would definately recommend.
5.0,Cute outfit. Thick fabric. Not cheaply made
5.0,Beautiful purse. Nice quality and a good value.
5.0,Very cute and can't beat the price
5.0,"It's nice to get something of quality to review. These shoes are great. Very comfortable yet sturdy. The straps hugs your feet but aren't too tight. The soles are cushy and the color is a rich, saturated hue. Very well made and stylish."
5.0,"I receive so many compliments when I wear this dress. It is very cute, classy, and comfortable. Definitely recommend this dress!"
5.0,I LOVE THIS!! I did order a XL and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù so it covers my butt perfectly. The arms aren‚Äôt too long And I love the stretch around the wrist it has. The mastery is super soft and the pink is super cute! I might have to order another in a different color.
5.0,"Great for, true to size. My son loves his new pjs"
5.0,Stayed in all day and didn't pull my hair!
5.0,OMG So perfect üòç
5.0,[[VIDEOID:2b65f59bfe5766906efaeda1a0bfb3ea]] Love all the choices in the light settings very bright vibrant different settings love it ....  and shockingly it‚Äôs very lightweight ..
5.0,"Great top, love it. It's comfy, stylish, hides belly fat, and can be worn to work or casually."
5.0,"The product is soft, durable and comfortable. Great for layering!"
5.0,I love them. They could not fit or feel better.
5.0,I loved the leggings real nice texture to them. Highly recommend
5.0,"Beautiful! Really nice size ,  crystal settings and color! Love it!"
5.0,Very nice but a bit too long for me. I got the xlarge and I'm 5'5 it goes way below my feet
5.0,Perfect and dainty for those of us with a lower set septum!
5.0,"Fit's great. I think the cut-out design is a fabulous idea for those of us who like to wear our hair in ponytails or in buns. Everybody at work keeps laughing at me when I wear the hat with my hair down, since I suppose it looks a little bit silly with the back half of the hat missing. :)  I keep telling them it's meant to be worn with your hair up, but I think it is great anyway. And it fits my head really well."
5.0,"This shirt is great for Halloween!  Happy. Fits well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 150# and I ordered L. Haven‚Äôt washed it yet so don‚Äôt know if it shrinks."
5.0,Excellent belt and reversible to boot.<br />Can easily cut to fit your size.
5.0,"Great quality bathing suit. My daughter is 3yo, 31lbs...the 3/4 bathing suit was too big. It‚Äôll probably fit when she‚Äôs closer to 4 so we will just be using the top and rolling the sleeves until it fits better."
5.0,"My son really likes these glasses, they sit well on his head"
5.0,Love the drape and texture.
5.0,Very pretty. It's the right size too.
5.0,"These are so comfy I never want to change. If you're tall definitely size up for leg length but I'm a standard US small and these fit great, slightly high on the ankle but nothing I'm worried about. I ordered the teal because I've been looking for pants this color for three years and it's absolutely GORGEOUS! the color is exactly as pictured. The texture is slightly odd (comfy and stretchy) but does have a slightly plastic feel to them just in case that matters to anyone. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about it because tactile stuff can bother me but after doing a morning stretch in these babies I'm obsessed."
5.0,Loved it. Worked just right for my costume
5.0,I decorated two tiny pine trees with the little ornament charms. So cute‚ÄºÔ∏è
5.0,"Wonderful. Its that kind of grandmother's cardigan, which is in trend now. Cosy. Wonderful. Love it!"
5.0,Woof!
5.0,"I needed to pick a costume that wouldn't be too much for my husband. So, a gangster was perfect. All we had to buy were the arm garters, a pocket watch with a long chain, and this Tommy gun. I LOVE that it's inflatable because we didn't want a bunch of extra ""stuff"" in the house once the season was over.<br />We won ""best couple""! ü§©ü•∞"
5.0,Great quality gift at a good price.  Very pleased with this authentic bit of Israel. Definitely would recommend this product.
5.0,They came right on time. Look just as pictured but as a small buttons toward the wrist that clip together.
5.0,"Honeymoon shirts, we loved them! Comfortable and a soft material with a little bit of stretch. Didn‚Äôt shrink much in the wash."
5.0,Very nice LEGO darth Vader key ring
5.0,"Very comfortable, doesn't cut into my skin at all. The fit was perfect."
5.0,"This dress is a great value. Super comfortable, flouncy, and fun. It's modest enough that you could wear it to work, but casual enough that you could wear it on dates, vacations, etc. Fabric is very soft and lightweight. I ordered the navy color and it looked like the picture, just a soft muted navy. I'm 5'7&#34; and about 135 pounds, 34C bust, and the medium fits me perfectly. I really hope this dress holds up after several wears because I really love wearing it and am already tempted to order another in a different color."
5.0,"I‚Äôve been wearing compression socks for years. Recently it became necessary for me to wear open toed socks, which my favorite brand did not carry. I now have two favorite brands. As I  need closed toed ones in winter boots, their blend is winter warm. My new Zeta socks, a cotton blend are summer cooler. Same compression and fit for both! Now the contented owner of seven pairs of both brands and styles<br /><br />Am happy to give this small business a thumb‚Äôs up!!"
5.0,"Loved the band! It is breathable so it doesn‚Äôt bother me when I workout. People have complemented the color.<br /><br />Only thing is i wish I could have bought it without the embellishments, as I do not use them."
5.0,"The best,toughest watch you can buy. I am in construction and have been buying these for years. They take a beating and last for years. I like the Casio work watches so much that I bought a Casio dress watch.Can't beat the price."
5.0,"They run large I usually wear 7 but I wear a 6 in these.<br />These are stunning and I cannot say enough about them!!<br />the silvery part is just slightly darker in person but they look just like the pic but way nicer - very elegant!<br />Footbed just has a bit of padding but you do not need it with the low, air like heel - these are dreamy on and off!!"
5.0,"Adorable dress! It's my new favorite for a dinner out in the summer, or to any party. Fits comfortably and looks very sexy."
5.0,Bras are pretty good material . Did lose the padding but I have had it for over a year and they still work amazing
5.0,"If I could give this coat 10 stars I would; it‚Äôs better than any name brand coat I‚Äôve ever had. This coat is perfection! It exceeded my expectations for quality and fit and the price seemed too good to be true but you get more than what you paid for. Anyone one a tight budget looking for quality, this is the coat to beat."
5.0,3 months in with this wallet and it braking in nicely to contour around my cards.  No sign of actual wear.  Awesome for the price. I really like the pull tab in the back that I use for my second most used card.  My most used card goes in the front piece.
5.0,"These are really cute sunglasses that go with many outfits. They aren't cheap and are pretty durable. Perfect size for face, not too big or small, and fit well around my head. Great for the price!"
5.0,My daughter loved her swimsuit!!!
5.0,"Belt exactly as described, very well package and perfect communications. ebay at it‚Äôs best."

5.0,"I love this dress, so comfy. Not to tin. Fits perfect. I'm 5'8&#34;, 196 lb, large is the perfect size."
5.0,"For an inexpensive hat, this one is nice. I steamed the crown a bit and pulled it on tightly. Fits like a glove now!"
5.0,Definitely worth purchasing! My car tassel needed the year and it looks fabulous I‚Äôm my car!
5.0,Better quality than I imagined. Exactly what I was looking for...came fast and my 2 year old loves the flower.
5.0,I usually wear a 2x top.took a chance and got xl since measurement chart said it would fit.it fits great.my bust is a 44.looks great with leggings and heels or boots.a definite recommendation.
5.0,Love this owl! Especially cute is what he is holding! My owl & friend is a wonderful addition to my collection!
5.0,This pair of earrings are gorgeous. They look exactly as pictured. A great size and seem very sturdy. I am happy with the price for a good value.
5.0,Very funny shaped dress I quite can‚Äôt understand how it fit the model the way it did materials very cheap and wrinkles easily see-through I think that maybe not even a thin tall person would look right in this dress very poorly made just weird I may have received defective product but regardless I didn‚Äôt like it and returned it I‚Äôm 51 138 pounds bought a mediumWhich I know is my normal size for something like that and it was just totally off
5.0,Very Satified. Loved product & size was perfect. Thank you.
5.0,"Nice heavy band,  well stitched.  The leather is smooth and attractive.  I expect this band to last a good long time."
5.0,I like these earnings. They sparkle in dark light. They bling in the sun. You should give these a try
5.0,My wife wanted this for Valentines.  She loves it.
5.0,Omg they are more cuter in person üòç
5.0,The bouth of them fixz great an they're on fleek with da shine yo thanks!
5.0,"Just love these leather bands, and many of the colors. The rose and brown combination is especially pretty! I wear it a LOT!!!"
5.0,"I wore these for a 1920's themed New Year's party. They were surprisingly good quality and quite comfortable. I'm a size 12/14, and these fit perfectly. They didn't cut in or cause bulging in the arm area. I cut the fingertips off my pointer, so I could still use my phone throughout the evening."
5.0,"Great necklace! Solid weight, perfect size, double-sided. The string is cheap and rubbery though, I just moved it to a new piece of leather and it was perfect!"
5.0,"Smooth feeling, strong. Overall a great product"
5.0,Like it much!!
5.0,next time will buy L
5.0,Love it feels good and you can breathe
5.0,La falda es exactamente igual el color que ped√≠ y me lleg√≥ r√°pidamente lo √∫nico que es demasiado larga tengo que cortarle o usarla como vestido porqu√© no puedo usarla as√≠ de ancho se ajusta bien al cuerpo pero lo largo es para una persona bien alta.
5.0,love these very much...
5.0,Absolutely love this. It's even better in person!
5.0,Really cute but also sexy. Would recommend for costuming or a night out.
5.0,This is a great everyday watch my husband loves it. It is scratch resistance which makes it a great watch for work. It also looks stylish for special occasions. Great value for money.
5.0,"Worked out of box. Charged reasonably quick, haven't used it for more than 3 hrs. Straight. Kids are really enjoying. (So are the adults who see it.)"
5.0,These are a good set of socks for people with larger size feet.  They were purchased for a man with size 13 shoes who always seems to struggle with finding good size socks and these fit really well.  They seem to wash up well and hold their shape afterwards.
5.0,It was liked
5.0,Very lightweight and comfortable.  Just what is needed during this hot summer.
5.0,Stays clipped on my pandora bracelet better than the pandora clasp did. It's also great quality.
5.0,It is much thicker than normal face mask bandannas and the adjustable drawstring helps keep it secure on my face. So much better than regular masks because it can easily be moved up and down when going in and out of stores.
5.0,"Very cute top! I ordered a medium, fit was good, wish the length was a little longer."
5.0,Beautiful necklace for my niece who graduated high school. A lovely reminder that she goes to college with a lot of love behind her. Great value for the money.
5.0,I love these knee warmers because they are thicker than most and they are made a little larger than some I've bought in the recent past. They are nice and long like the picture. I bought 3 pairs because I haven't found other knee warmers that have all the categories I want; Thicker + Larger + Longer = Warmer + Better Circulation  The shipping was fast and I would Definitely recommend this product and seller.
5.0,High quality! I will buy more!
5.0,Looked very nice on
5.0,Perfect for school
5.0,I love it!!!! Beautiful jewelry for a sci-fi lady!
5.0,They look great! Can't wait to give them as gifts!
5.0,Bracelet arrived on time.  Was in original box and plastic.  Very nice. Could not have expected better.  Thank You.  Would use this seller again.
5.0,"Sooo cute! It‚Äôs exactly as pictured. I ordered 2T- 3T and I think it‚Äôs fitting a little closer to 2T. Which is fine for us. I also love the price. Very cute, would definitely buy again!"
5.0,I love this swim suit! I was skeptical of ordering online but the fit is perfect. The bottoms give the right coverage in all of the right places and the top gives the girls some lift! A+
5.0,This pullover is very cozy and soft. It is one of my favorite sweaters to wear!!
5.0,This purse is very nice.  I ordered out for my granddaughter she loved it and I do too. I'm buying one for myself
5.0,Such a cute gift for Mother‚Äôs Day! She loved it
5.0,Veteran recognation
5.0,"They are indeed thicker than normal tank tops, but after 5 washes, so far I haven't seen any degradation of the material itself. The logo has worn off in some of them, but that doesn't really matter for me. They feel super comfortable and fit perfectly.The variation in colors is a bonus too! (at least for me)"
5.0,I just love my necklace.perfect for iguana lovers like me!
5.0,Love it! Light weight and cool. All my friends ask me where I got it. Looks super cute on. I ordered 2X & fits as expected.
5.0,"Cute watch band and very soft silicone. Looks really cute with my series 6 Apple Watch and the glitter is really pretty. The only thing I would change is maybe having an XL size option instead of this one (M/L), I wear my watches always on my left side and I have congestive heart failure and my left arm, wrist and hand are much bigger on my left side. I‚Äôve tried to wear it on my right side (which fits so much better), but I just can‚Äôt get used to it on that side. I did take the pics with it on my right side.<br />Most of y‚Äôall won‚Äôt have this problem."
5.0,"Great socks for the price.  It has become very difficult to find bamboo socks in the U.S., so it seemed worthwhile to try overseas. These socks are just what I wanted. They are plain black, soft and cozy, but thin enough to wear with normal shoes and pants. They stay up on my legs and don't slide down into my shoes.  No complaints.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  And I love that I no longer have to match up my socks after doing the laundry, since I bought a dozen pair!"
5.0,"Durable, good looking wallet. Seems to be made well; I've been abusing it for a few months and it's holding up just fine. Moved to this after yet another fashion-grade leather wallet fell apart on me."
5.0,Quality product and very soft
5.0,"This is a fantastic ring. It is a thick comfort fit ring that I can't believe cost less than $20. What a value!!<br />I would give this ring ten stars if I could. The ring size runs large. I ordered a size 8 instead of a size 8.5. The ring fits perfectly. If I lose this ring, I'll buy another. The shipment arrived as promised."
5.0,Love the feel of this wallet. My LG G5 fits (without a case) in the inner side pocket.
5.0,Me quedo muy bien gracias
5.0,"The red. black, yellow, blue tasseled ear rings are extremely long for me.  I cut about an inch off.  I gave some of the ear rings as gifts.  I enjoy them."
5.0,Love the dress. Beautiful details.
5.0,"WHAT A DEAL! WENT TO RADIO SHACK,THEY WERE $4.99 EACH. THE CATCH? OUT OF STOCK AND  THE MAIN SUPPLIER ALSO DOESN'T STOCK ANYMORE. FOUND THEM HERE IN A 5 PACK SOOO MUCH CHEAPER , WERE AT MY FRONT DOOR BEFORE I KNEW IT! GREAT BUY AND ABSOLUTELY GREATER SERVICE!"

5.0,"My wife was introduced to this brand Ekouaer by one of her friends. Tried 3 dresses from them. Very happy so far. She had nothing but great things to say about the fit and the fabric feel. She is yet to try all of them. However, this one has made her very happy."
5.0,"Get these, they are the  best period product on the market."
5.0,I love this mask you can breathe when wearing it and UT don't foggy up your glasses
5.0,Beautiful dress!  Came right on time as promised. I sent in my measurements and it fit me like a glove!  The only down side is it didn't look exactly as pictured. The gradient on the front is V-shaped in picture and mine is straight across. It was still a big hit and I got TONS of compliments!
5.0,"Son loves it!  Exactly what he wanted. Fits as expected, quality as expected."
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous. I have purchased dresses of similar style and material at David's Bridal for close to $200. Amazing for the price. I ordered a size 2, which is my usual dress size. I am 5'6 and the dress was the length as shown with 3-4 inch wedges. Could have worn flatter shoes and still would have been an appropriate length. Got a ton of compliments. It will need steamed, but so worth it."
5.0,"Love the in graving , it's not big it's not small it's just the perfect size and very much uplifting"
5.0,These are super comfy and I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase.  You can‚Äôt beat the price.  Just order a size smaller than you normally would.  I‚Äôm a size 6.5-7 but I ordered the 6.  There‚Äôs still plenty of room for bulky socks.  Great for indoor and outdoor use.  Added bonus is that it came with a nice shoe bag that I can use for traveling.
5.0,Great watch so far.. Easy to read!
5.0,"Fit as expected, looked great for my friends outdoor wedding."

5.0,We gifted this to my son's Library class teacher. She loved it. The colors are very nice but I think ( because I did not open the package ) it felt thin...
5.0,"Great tank top! It pulls ever so slightly to the left, but its barely noticeable. I love it!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:6261c9d72dea5b1d66e864477fd4a88]] Love. Had a silver pair but wanted gold, also. Came in a box with the earrings and the black leather type drawstring bag. Great buy. Would buy 10 times over again."
5.0,These are well made and very lightweight.  It has a soft footbed and fit well.....not bulky.
5.0,The material is thick and the fit is wow! But just be careful when washing/drying it.

5.0,"Love the quality and the feel of this shawl, very well made!"
5.0,Loooooved this dress! I got so many compliments when i wore it to a wedding.  The color is stunning and seriously looks more expensive than it is.  It is thick so doesnt show anything! I am 5'3&#34; 122 lbs and ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.

5.0,"My 8 year old niece LOVED these when she first tried them on.  They're not the most amazing quality but ya know what, the darn kid grew out of them within a couple weeks anyway.  ..I wasn't expecting the quality of an adult's shoe when I purchased these as a gift so we were both satisfied with the product."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine.  It is really well made and comes in a little sachet.  The pendant is large, about the size of a half dollar and the stones are real stones.  the chain that it comes with has a link at the end and a few inches in so that you can select to wear it at chest length or just below the collar bone."
5.0,Killer jacket at stupid low price. You can't regret this one.
5.0,"My favorite dress by far this season. When I make a bit more room in my wardrobe, I will buy it in another color....just love love love. Fit is big but comfortable, its airy and flowy and it breathes. It looks beautiful on and there are pockets!!!!"
5.0,"I wore these for one full day while going around. This will definitely be used by me when I travel overseas for my month long vacation. This feels like a sound product and will not slip, sag or fall off my leg."
5.0,Even more beautiful in person.
5.0,I normally wear a medium for some reason the medium was too big. I returned it and got a small and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'3..175 lbs.
5.0,This shirt is extremely soft and very flattering for a full figure.
5.0,"great bra for a GURL wit barely anything uptop ,,ANDREA"

On top of this one of the best Seiko caliber 4R36 (could be wind by hand or auto).  all of this was for 154$  any price below 200$ will make a very good purchase. forgot-  sapphire  is also here!
5.0,I enjoy the fit & feel of these leggings
5.0,I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but I just received these in the mail and they are awesome! The fit is great and the material is very good quality. I may order a second pair!
5.0,"It was a great prop for our Halloween candy giving. While it might have been fun to have one that opens up, we used it merely to complete the look. And it did."
5.0,These are my husbands new favorite pants!
5.0,"Absolutely Fabulous!  Purchasing Bras is Always a hassle when You wear a 48DD, or larger, But for the price I couldn't pass up.  WOW I Love This Bra.

5.0,"As many other reviews startled, these gloves for very comfortably and are not hot. I have lupus and photo sensitivity makes my lower knuckles blister. These were a godsend!"
5.0,"I am working up the courage to wear them. I didn't realize how short they were but once I lose the proper weight, the will fit better."
5.0,Great bag. Perfect size and easy to handle. Folds nice and holds tablets really well. Has window for easy product identification.

5.0,"And here‚Äôs why...<br /><br />The good-<br />-Great material.<br />-Great idea, woman‚Äôs company and fair trade.<br />-Really great price.<br /><br />The meh-<br />-They fit, but not really comfortably as the rise can‚Äôt make up its mind. I will wash them a few times and see if I change my mind.<br />-They don‚Äôt hang well. Again, I will wash them a few times and see if I change my mind.<br />-The fact that I have to wash them a few times in order to discover if they work for me or not.<br /><br />All in all I‚Äôm still sitting a 3.5 and really hoping to go to 5 stars. Fingers crossed.<br /><br />UPDATE- Freaking awesome pants. So sorry that they are gone."
5.0,"Gorgeous and new<br />couldn't be happier.  Great makeup bag,"
5.0,"I don‚Äôt know about you, but I am ALWAYS looking for my glasses, mainly because I really need them to read practically anything. Recently they came out with the blue light problem, especially when you use your cell phone or in my case, both my Kindle and cell phone. So when I can‚Äôt find my reading it is VERY upsetting! I found these VERY low cost Rimless, Anti Blue Ray reading glasses and due to the cost I wasn‚Äôt really expecting anything great at all. I was very surprised when I received them. Sure they weren‚Äôt packaged fancy, just in zip locked plastic bags in a bubble envelope. The glasses themselves were a BIG surprised. I have readers that I paid A LOT more for and they weren‚Äôt as nice as these and for the price, amazing that you get two of them. They are very well made. The ear pieces are firmly attached to the top rims and the glasses themselves are comfortable to wear. The magnification is perfect for what I needed. As a whole, I am very impressed by these readers and recommend them wholeheartedly!<br />If there is any change in my experience with these glasses, I will return and write an update."
5.0,"good band, easy to adjust if you google removing watch links. instructions provided are poor"
5.0,Perfect fit love it wish u had more colors
5.0,I love this necklace.  It pretty much goes with everything ~
5.0,Very nice. Just what I was looking for.
5.0,"I'm glad I didn't buy a size larger.  I almost did, but figured they would be stretchy and hoped for the best. I'm glad I did because these were larger than I expected. The fit is actually quite nice (as I said, I expected them to be a bit on the small side) and they legs were super long.  I'm 5'9&#34;, and they could really use to be hemmed an inch or two.<br /><br />So far the quality has been good and I haven't had any issues with them.  We will see how they hold up with all my dance classes."
5.0,"PERFECT work attire dress.  It's easily ironable, doesn't get really wrinkled and feels good wearing it.  I purchases this dress in both brown and black.  I plan to purchase a few more for work as well. I'd highly recommend."
5.0,These are so big! Sturdy and fold up to very small size.
5.0,"Great quality, recommending to buy. Thank you very much!"

5.0,"Bought long sleeve too, only thing with short sleeve was it's a little big and only got a large ( 5'10 like 175 lbs avg build)."
5.0,I bought this for my sister as a baby shower dress. She was IN LOVE. She was able to move with ease and even hoped it would fit after her pregnancy. Very inexpensive. Would buy again and recommend it.
5.0,This is a really cute shirt
5.0,"I was  A little skeptical given the low price, but I am completely impressed.<br /><br />After cutting the belt to size, it‚Äôs possibly the most comfortable belt I‚Äôve ever worn. No exaggeration.<br /><br />Hope it‚Äôs durable, cause I‚Äôm buying another color."
5.0,"Dress fits beautifully. Wish it had lining and side pockets. Oh well, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride!!  Lol."

5.0,Loved these so much I ordered more!
5.0,Very light weight and easy to load with groceries.
5.0,"I got it for my husband and he said it fits comfortably. Despite the fact that I hate how we have to wear masks, I think his looked very nice on him. It is made slightly different than others I've seen, so they do seem to provide a more fitted coverage. They have a strip at the top where you can form it to your nose. The extra filters are nice. I would definitely recommend you purchase this mask for anyone you know in the Marines."
5.0,Muy hutil algo peque√±o
5.0,This dress is absolutely beautiful. Very flattering on a curvy figure. Will post pictures soon!
5.0,I got this for my boyfriend who was an army medic for 18 years before he got hurt.  He absolutely loves it. Very nice material. Looks great.
5.0,it was a perfect gift for my granddaughters.

5.0,It was a gift for my daughter and son-in-law due to buying their 1st home and they were not cheap looking they were nice and they were excited to immediately put there keys on.
5.0,Exactly what is in the picture came on time .
5.0,"Soft ., perfect colors ., great quality"
5.0,very nice fit smooth
5.0,Fit as expected and arrived on time
5.0,Good leather quality
5.0,my product is still fairly new so i am not sure about the long term quality but so far i LOVE it and it looks beautiful with my rose gold apple watch! i recommend :)
5.0,"These socks are well made, soft, with good ‚Äògrippies‚Äô on the bottom. All of the patterns a very cute. I would definitely purchase these again especially with the very fair price!"
5.0,"I purchased this a few days ago for an upcoming interview. I'm delighted at the fit. It's perfect. It goes well with a navy blazer for the interview, but it's so comfortable and versatile I'll likely wear it all the time. Can't wait to get more.<br /><br />Please note..... I'm five foot two and very short waisted. The top fits perfectly and the skirt to just above my knees. I'd worry if you were taller or had longer preportions as it fits me as a short girl very well."
5.0,"Shoes are dope, good product"
5.0,I Love it!!! It's beautiful!!!! So brilliant in colors!!! I bought this for a present. I know my friend will love it as well. Very well made also
5.0,"I bought it as a gift to my wife, these glasses are very nice and she really likes and loves them."
5.0,"These are so, so pretty.  The metallic silver, peaking through the cut-outs, is simply stunning.  I hate that they're slippers because I'd totally wear them out and about.  As is typical of Uggs, these are snug when you first start wearing them, but then the wool molds to your feet and they fit like a glove.  They're so comfortable and so warm.  I have absolutely no negatives to report about these slippers.  They're everything they should be and more!  I do wish they were cheaper but they'll last forever, so they're a worthy investment, in my opinion."
5.0,Got this as a gift for a friend. She loves it!
5.0,Super buena calidad  y el precio excelentes justo lo q necesitaba
5.0,These did not fit in the cartilage ear piercings but they look just as cute in my lobes. I would recommend for that purpose.
5.0,My nieces and daughter love them.
5.0,Form fitting. Nice
5.0,The fabric is nice
5.0,Great bag. Perfect size for athletic unform. Ruggedly constructed.
5.0,"I love this earring. I use it for my helix piercing and it‚Äôs exactly what I needed. It‚Äôs harder to get it to hook together than some hoops, but once it hooks it‚Äôs very difficult to get it undone on accident. So far it‚Äôs only come unhooked accidentally once while at the hair salon and it caught on a comb. Highly recommended for someone who doesn‚Äôt like to change their jewelry all the time."
5.0,"This little bag works great; it holds a good amount of weight and, it‚Äôs cute. You will get a lot of compliments."
5.0,"Hello this Erica the reviewer once again with anothe product review.<br />The first this I need is say is that this bracelet is stunning. It is very radiant and elegant. It is a gold color with clear crystals on it. It does not turn black or make your wrist green. I have had it for 2 weeks now and I must say I do everything with it on. I even shower with it on and it has not lost its color or shine. If your a diva this bracelet is definitly a must have for you. Treat yourself to this stunning bracelet.<br />This is Erica the reviewer in and out, thank you!"
5.0,Love the swimsuit very flattering.  got lots of compliments.  I think it fits a little bigger on the back but that is because I thought it said 12 - 14 and it came as a 14 - I am kinda between that range.  Great buy will keep and if need to take a tuck in the sides.
5.0,This is a great chain. I put one of my large floating lockets on it and were it constantly. Since I have three lockets I can switch to the one I want to wear in just a few minutes and be ready to roll. This is stainless steel so I don't have to worry about marking my neck or tarnishing.
5.0,The perfect cover for your head when it is cold and the wind is blowing. The muffler covers the neck and tucks down inside shirt or jacket.  Keeps you warm. Bit over priced but when the wind is blowing and it is cold outside you will love it.
5.0,I love it no
5.0,Comfortable! Great fit and flexible!
5.0,I have this in two colors and wear them all the time. I took the buttons and embroidered patches off and it's really versatile now.

5.0,"Smaller than I expected, but thats probably a good thing considering all the keys I carry. Cute ~"
5.0,So far it's has served the purpose that made me purchase it.
5.0,"I really like the fabric, colors and it feels so comfortable."
5.0,"Really liked the unique design on this hat for my 2 1/2 grandson. He really liked it too. Was hard to find a hat for his age and glad I found this one on Amazon. As always, fast shipping."
5.0,"Perfect--- shows no sign of coming open on its own in my pocket, as those carbiner keychains seem to do before long.  Pricey but nice!"
5.0,It was just what I was looking for. For some reason they are becoming more scarce. This was exactly as advertised and was delivered on time. I would use this vendor again.
5.0,loved it!
5.0,"Bought this ring as a replacement for the tungsten carbide wedding band for my husband. It has held up wonderfully considering he works in construction. Added bonus, because it's ceramic the ring is very light and comfortable!"
5.0,I purchased this as a gift for my future sister-in-law. It's so pretty! The pearls are lovely and look beautiful on the gold strands. I wish I was keeping it for myself!

5.0,I was very please with the quality of this suit. So affordable. My first online swim suit purchase and I am so pleased I then ordered it in black. I have yet to wear it in the pool or beach so I do not know how it does in the water but so far it is cute
5.0,Desert boots...
5.0,"When I received these masks I was immediately pleased with the material. The material is very lightweight, breathes easy, fits comfortably, and best of all they are fashionable. I buy these and give them as small gifts to friends and family. Really worth the buy and the price."
5.0,Love these and the price.  They are a great knock off for Converse.  I heat pressed a KU Jayhawk on the side in red glitter and it looks awesome!
5.0,can't beat $2 and it looks great !!!!!!!!!
5.0,"Amazon you've made me proud. The packaging was perfect, i was so pleased when i pulled the bag. The container was an excellent choice. Reusable for many things. The earrings are cute!!!!! Nice gift for many friends at an affordable cost."
5.0,"We had to file a claim because the necklace broke apart. Instead of them asking for me to ship it in and have to wait a long time. They instead, gave me an Amazon gift card for the original price of the necklace. This allowed me to find and buy a replacement necklace right away!"
5.0,"Gorgeous and a good price. I've looked at these elsewhere. If anything, I could have sized 1/2 size down.<br />They are nice looking , very well made and comfortable! Worth the money! Recommend!"
5.0,"I love this short sleeve shirt because its very soft and provides great arm  coverage and it's the perfect length for my petite height.<br />I keep my shirts from shrinking by line drying them. They still look brand new and I have had mine for almost a year so they wear quite well.<br />I am back to buy several more because I know a good thing when I have it and they always discontinue my favorite items.<br />It's lightweight but not thin. I have worn mine to the beach , the airport, grocery shopping, the gym, to my yoga class and to work under a blazer.<br />I love this tee shirt."

5.0,"I wear this all the time! Fits perfect, is very warm, and I get a lot of comments!"
5.0,Love this dress! The quality is better than I thought after reading the other reviews - impressed me. It travels well in my carry on luggage and ready to wear for work meetings. I've dressed it up with jewelry and after work with my jean jacket. I'm 5'3 and 160 lbs and glad I ordered the XL.
5.0,"Love this dress. It is very comfortable, I have it in 3 colors."
5.0,"Got six, as it said. All colors shown except the clear. Didn't really care which six that I got. Love them!"
5.0,"These are super cute, I receive compliments every time I wear them. I love that they‚Äôre adjustable and velvet lined to help keep them in place without being too tight."
5.0,this is now my favorite shirt to wear! love it ty
5.0,It is extremely comfortable and makes you sweat alot! I highly recommend and will buy again!
5.0,"I'm 5' Nothing, this coat reaches to my ankles and I Love it! I bought a small. After reading reviews I waffled back and forth between small and medium. I went with small. I like a snug jacket, and this one is only snug in the shoulders, which is usual for me. I could have gotten medium, but I wouldn't be as happy with the all over fit in medium. The small flatters my waistline and the fall of the jacket is stunning. Pics don't do it justice."
5.0,I bought this bathrobe since it's weighted and I am very impressed with quality. It's very soft and weight is enough for moderate shoulder massage. I wish the bathrobe was hooded too which unfortunately it's not.
5.0,"Very nice looking tags, they seem like they'll hold up for a few trips. Will buy again for the cost if damaged or broken."
5.0,there were so many difrent once amazing not one of them were the same i have one to where every day of the month
5.0,"I bought these because I wanted pants with pockets.  Not only do these have DEEP pockets but they are so comfortable (just a bit long for my height). The material is not thin and will be nice for cooler weather.  I got a 3X, these are perfect since I am a plus size girl with thick legs. Love the open bottoms because regular sweats cut into my ankles. My only complaint  is I wish there were more available colors in my size.  I bought the red and purple space design but if had the chance would get every color.  These are so comfy I don't want to take them off."
5.0,"I bought a slightly different model from Viktor thru another website after searching through a great many different brands of pilot watches.  I have to say I'm impressed.  Very nice watch.  I have a number of other watches with Swiss and Japanese watches... some mechanical, some quartz.  This might be my new favorite."
5.0,Looks just like the picture.  Item arrived as promised.  Made a little girl very happy.
5.0,Love  ‚ù§Ô∏è this shirt but it runs small so I have to Exchange for a larger size but that‚Äôs OK I can‚Äôt wait to get it back
5.0,"I really like this bracelet, haven‚Äôt taken it off since received. It is snug but still moves quite freely"
5.0,"I love these , I just leave them on when I ash my jeans, there great"
5.0,"Always a little difficult ordering sunglasses without trying them on but I love these so much I ordered them in black the next week. The quality is fantastic, sturdy and stylish."
5.0,"Great bag, perfect price, and awesome size!"
5.0,Love it! Perfect!
5.0,"First, I loves me some Timex watches. Yeah, they are not the most expensive watches but they are certainly reliable for the $$, and if you take care of them they'll last for years. This is now one of my favorite watches in my 400+ collection and definitely one of my favorite Timex watches. It is stunningly handsome to wear and the onion crown is easy to handle when setting the watch."
5.0,"This is a beautiful beach cover up. It‚Äôs lightweight but not cheap looking or feeling. The colors are very vivid‚Äîand the shape is flattering. It isn‚Äôt baggy. It falls fluidly, and sort of floats. You can‚Äôt really see much through it, but plan to wear your bathing suit. The side slits do go up high.  You do need to wear it off the shoulder to have it fall properly, but it looks great that way. I like mine so much I am having it hemmed (it is long for me, because I am slightly under 5‚Äô4‚Äù).  A+++!!!"
5.0,"I love this strap. I actually wear it all the time. It fits my wrist perfectly and looks fancy, if it was bigger I would worry that it wouldn't be tight enough for the Fitbit to measure HR etc. For reference my wrist is a little over 6.5 inches round."
5.0,I love these earrings! Simple and clean-looking.
5.0,"Luxurious feeling so soft, silky, smooth. No pinching, pulling, squeezing; an extremely comfortable fit--especially in the pouch. Don't know why I waited so long to try something different. So glad I finally did!"
5.0,Beautiful!  Purchased as a gift for my Mom!
5.0,Look so glamours and not fake!
5.0,This was a lot of fun and fit great
5.0,"they came as expected, feel good look Good. my heisenberg look is complete.  for the price you can't ask for anything better."
5.0,Craftsmanship is wonderful
5.0,one size
5.0,I love them. Durable and nice looking.
5.0,Great slippers! Very comfortable and good quality
5.0,It‚Äôs shaped really cute for little girls.
5.0,Went as Matt Foley (Chris Farley's motivational speaker character from SNL) for Halloween. This really tied the costume together. I actually won the costume contest!
5.0,Love love love love love wish I would‚Äôve invented this
5.0,"So pretty!<br />I bought it as a gift, but now I want one for myself."
5.0,"I've had this case for a week, and I dropped it once. Not a single scratch on the case. Amazing buy and amazing price. If you want a really slim case that was the cutouts so you have access to all the important parts of your phone, and you bought an Samsung Galaxy Note 9 I suggest you buy this case. You can get any color for the same price. Not a lot of sellers do that on Amazon. I learned that when I looked for a case for my new phone."
5.0,Perfect fit! Great value
5.0,Fitbit Versa2  Bands rose gold hardware matches well with rose on my Versa2.
5.0,"Gorgeous dress. The fabric is thick and not cheap. The neckline is also really cute sweetheart style. Its a little tight on me in the bust but the medium I thin would be too large and too long. I ordered a small I'm 5'1"" and it hits right above my knee. I can zip it up but once get to my chest a little tight. I'm a 32C and weigh 127. The white color is very nice!!"
5.0,Beautiful and they loved it. Will order more. Fast shipping
5.0,Best Birthday Ever! My daughter loved them. It‚Äôs her favorite characters and she is collecting puns.
5.0,"I like everything about this light bathrobe. I'm not sweaty in it. It's perfect for packing small and wearing modestly when I go traveling. It arrived in time before my trip. I tried it on, washed it, and was even better after I washed it. I like the gray color which goes with my gray hair. It'll go with all my more brightly colored night clothes. - - Thanks to the sellers!"
5.0,Bought this as a gift. Look forward to seeing her reaction when she opens it. Very cute necklace and very good price
5.0,Got the studs two days after placing the order.  They look great but since I am no diamond expert I'll have to assume they really are diamonds.
5.0,"Living in Texas requires constantly carrying sunglasses.  I need prescription sunglasses, resulting in the fact that I always had to have two pairs of glasses with me.  The cases took up quite a bit of room in my purse.  This leather case is soft, pliable, well made and PERFECT.  I bought another case to keep as a spare....so glad with my purchase."
5.0,"So cute! I bought a few of these, but I get the most compliments on the black cat. It has done its job keeping any unwanted debris (dirt, sand, etc) out of the headphone port on beach adventures."
5.0,Bra fits just right. I like the support it gives and it lifts the lady's just right. I would recommend it.
5.0,Excellent condition and a perfect gift!
5.0,"This is a pretty lightweight jeans jacket with 3/4 inch sleeves, perfect for Florida evenings."
5.0,So cute and I rarely wear women's long sleeve shirts and sweatshirts because I hate how they fit. I have a longer torso so I'm picky. I'm 5'5 169lbs and this fits amazing. I love it.
5.0,My son loved it!!!
5.0,IT FITS perfectly for the 1950 s VINTAGE dress .It is making the dress look very classy and fashionably.
5.0,I loveeeees them.  I wear them so often and works perfectly for cycling as well.  The pockets are the best part
5.0,"I normally wear an extra small or small in dresses, but the medium fits perfectly! It fits my cousin as well. We are both around 5 feet tall, 34B, and wear a size 2-4. The dress is so soft and flattering!"
5.0,Very soft and long. Great buy!! Will compliment any outfit...
5.0,"these are the first ones that have not already started slipping down the earpiece, in most of the ones I have had they slip down or off the earpiece quite early.  Finally found one I like."
5.0,"I usually wear a medium but ordered a large, fit perfectly!! Still trying to figure out the multi ways the top ties. But the bottoms are great fit!"
5.0,As expected. Perfect fit. Using to workout
5.0,I love this band because it goes with everything. It's lightweight so you don't even know you have it on most of the time. It's great for everyday wear and I don't have to worry about damaging it.
5.0,My grandson adores these sneakers and they are colorful and cute.
5.0,"Mine arrived today,<br />Very nice."
5.0,I have had excellent experience with Totes. This is the second one that I have bought.  The first latest through years of New York City winters and summer thunderstorms.
5.0,Was looking for a meaningful gift to get a coworker that just graduated as a Vet Tech and passed her state licensing exam. This was perfect and touching
5.0,Very cute - had to buy another because my step dad stole mine!
5.0,I brought these for my grand child and she loved that it not behind her ears
5.0,"Great fit, great look!"
5.0,"Great product, good price, and fast shipping. Would buy from again."
5.0,Fantastic gift for a little girl! I have a very happy and entertained 6 year old niece!
5.0,Love the case and that the glasses came with a cleaning cloth. Overall I notice A reduction with eye strains and headaches
5.0,love how light it is and comfortable. material seems like it will last long .
5.0,Husband got this for me and I love it. Super cute and comfy
5.0,"I purchased these gloves to hide an arm tattoo for work at the request of my employer.  They completely cover the tattoo, however, now customers constantly ask me what I did to my arm!  They are machine washable, but they tend to not come perfectly clean for me (working in a local hardware store...gets pretty dirty there).  All in all, I am very happy with these sleeves."
5.0,Work well and they look great.  These save me having to spend over $125.00 for prescription sunglasses.
5.0,I loved this dress. The colors are exactly as the picture shows. I received so many compliments on this dress at the Christmas party I attended. Definitely worth buying.
5.0,Backpack is made of sturdy material NOT cheap & flimsy. Very comfortable. Very happy and would order again.
5.0,Great fit and it‚Äôs soft. Good material and it‚Äôs absolutely precious with the glitter tutu and how it crosses in the back
5.0,This is so adorable on and very flattering but it is somewhat see through bc or the material. So keep that in mind. I will wear it over my swimsuit or boy shorts. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs totally sheer but since the material is knit you can sometimes see through. So def wear something you don‚Äôt mind showing underneath. Overall very pretty and I‚Äôm excited to wear
5.0,"Have gotten soooo many compliments on this bag. Everyone thinks it's designer! It is not, however. There is definitely cardboard in the construction. It is not soft. The clutch wallet is very convenient."
5.0,"Perfect fit, true to size. Washes well, soft, looks like the picture. Very happy!"
5.0,"This beanie and matching neck gaiter set is incredibly warm, thanks to the super soft faux fur lining. I liked the fact that this  generous-sized hat actually fit my head, while most are too small and slide up. I have used a neck gaiter in the past, and I find they are less work and less constricting than a scarf. Scarves I need to keep adjusting, but the neck gaiter stays put, and I can leave my jacket unzipped at the top because they‚Äôre so warm. Fabric is 60% acrylic, 40% Terylene; hand wash only, lay flat to dry."
5.0,"I bought these for our groomsmen to wear at our wedding, and they were perfect. They looked so nice. Great width. Great price."
5.0,This bag right here is the truth. I love that it's so compact and fits so well in my purse or jacket pocket. Yet sturdy and able to hold a truck load of groceries. So far so good. I can hold 5 cases of sodas in one bag. So I bought 2 more for groceries. Kudos
5.0,"Although these pajamas took super long to arrive in the mail, I love them! I literally wear them every night LOL!<br />They fit perfect and pretty good quality as well. Great purchase!"
5.0,I like this belly ring even more than I thought I would.  It's super cute and shiny and looks better than I had anticipated.
5.0,It was more than I thought it would be. Lovely addition to my collection
5.0,"This is my first pair of compression socks. So far, they're holding up well. Be sure to use the provided instructions to put them on, and hand washes in cold water only. I use them to run; enjoy the extra support they provide. For reference, I am 6'0"", 150 pounds, wear a size 10 women's shoe and purchased the S/M size which seems to fit well."
5.0,Love the shirt. Purchased for a Christmas gift. Thank you!
5.0,"Love it. Great unique style, perfect for street wear outfits. I am 5‚Äô7 175 and the one size still fits oversized on me. Not too big or too small!"
5.0,Fit perfectly. Colors are great
5.0,I ordered the Dearlovers  jumpsuit in two colors black and white. the fabric is a polyester/jersey/spandex fabric. it does indeed have a little stretch. I was skeptical about ordering due to the reviews not being consistent. The length is long I am 5'1 and I weigh 150 lbs I ordered a large. My measurements are 36B-33-38. Once again the length was long had to take to tailor. The fabric is neither thick nor thin it is as expected. I would suggest going to a store and finding the fabric to see if you like it. I like the fabric it is not cheap looking. The black dearlovers fit me better in total overall fit. The white fit but not as well as the black. I carefully inspected the stitching and it was good. I really like the fit on me and I am glad I took the chance and ordered. The belt is not the best but that happens with a lot of garments that come with belts so I was not expecting much. I hope this helps anyone else who may order. Also part of the reason I ordered a Large was because of the camel-toe references. And I am glad I ordered the large.
5.0,"Just gorgeous.  I'm very happy with them.  I have a couple of other mala necklaces but they lack the luster that these have.  I can use them for meditation and/or as a fashion accessory.  They came in a cute little gift box with a note from Amorwing encouraging me to contact them if there is any issue with the necklace.  We'll see how they do after some handling, but so far the more than exceed my expectation."
5.0,"Larger than expected.  Works well.  I suggest cutting one into 2 pieces, it will be easier to use."
5.0,"love it! perfect size for my phone, ear buds, cards, and cash! also really good quality"
5.0,Loved everything
5.0,"I really like this dress. I've tried it as full length, at half calf with a belt and above the knee and they all looked great. The colors are vibrant and the fabric is nice also."
5.0,I love these! They are so comfortable and fit really well. My only comaint is that I would like to order another pair and you no longer have them listed. Please bring them back!
5.0,"True to size, really soft material. I get a lot of compliments when I'm wearing it."
5.0,"This leather toiletry bag has two main compartments of equal size. They will fit a bottle of shampoo, deodorant, hairbrush, shaving equipment, toothbrush and toothpaste. One of the main compartments has an internal zippered pouch, great for keeping small items together, or stashing valuables such as a ring or necklace while you bathe. That same side also has an outer side zippered-compartment.<br />The zipper pulls are all over 2"" long and easy to grasp. The leather handle is a strap going across the top of the bag and down one side. There is a loop near the corner where you can pull the majority of the strap to either the top or side, giving you the option of carry-orientation.<br />The leather is smooth and appears durable. The stitching is even and straight. I recommend this bag!"
5.0,"Very nice material, sturdy and soft."
5.0,"Arrived on time, great little bag"
5.0,It‚Äôs a Christmas present- but it sure looks like he‚Äôll love it!!!
5.0,Loved the quality and blend of colours. My daughter wore it at graduation.
5.0,"This flower is just one of twelve I bought to form a bouquet.  They're absolutely beautiful and will compliment any home.  Each rose is 12 inches long.  This rose would also make a beautiful gift.  There's a special vase that will hold all twelve flowers, but a simple bud vase will hold two."
5.0,Came before its time. LOVE ITTTTT<br />Such a masterpiece
5.0,I bought this for a Havana nights party and it was PERFECT!!!! I am usually anywhere between a 6-10 and I ordered M and it was perfect!! So many compliments and so comfy!!
5.0,Very cute good material for the price. The shorts come at the perfect length for high waisted. The top is perfect. Love it. The yellow is more of a pink but i actually love it.
5.0,"The fit issue is my fault, I should of ordered a smaller size. HOWEVER....I took it in a lil' wore it and it is STUNNING"
5.0,"I knew it could run a little big. I wear a size 20 ish and often wear a 2x in shirts. I ordered a 2x and it is a bit big. Even my kids noticed that. However, I do not like constricting bathrobes, so I'm good. Love the buttons! I can just pull it over my head too. Not particularly soft on the inside but not terrible. Keeps me a great temperature without overheating in fleece or polyester. I am 5'6&#34; and it comes to no more than 2 inches off the floor. I like long robes, that close without a tie (though you could use something for one if needed), I need all cotton. Works great for me! Wash on gentle and dry in the dryer before wearing. It will take a lot of the initial fuzz off and save your other attire from picking it up."
5.0,"The sound volume does not ‚Äòblow your ear drums‚Äô, but it is perfect for keeping noise out if you want to ignore people/the world for a run or something. Plus the beanie is fleece lined so it‚Äôs SUPER warm. Great gadget to own in my opinion."
5.0,I haven‚Äôt taken it out of the pkg yet but it loos o.k..
5.0,These were very comfortable.  They fit perfectly.
5.0,Fits great and is in great detail!
5.0,"They are so very comfortable.  A little clunky looking and a bit heavy, but wonderful feeling on the feet.  You could easily walk or stand all day in these things."
5.0,Exactly as described and looks great.
5.0,Great quality coat for fantastic price. My son and I both love it!
5.0,It took me a few tries to get the correct size but if you have breasts then definitely only choose the size based on your breast measurement. I ended up going a size larger than most tops I usually wear based on the measurement chart. Quick delivery and super easy if need to return/replace.  Very comfortable and soft fabric - looks great and as shown in image. Will likely be ordering in other colors.
5.0,Very soft and nice flattering cut.
5.0,I feel flirty and sexy in this dress and I get a lot of compliments.
5.0,Perfect well made comfy warm shirt
5.0,Very lightweight and comfortable!
5.0,"They work okay on my iPhone. They are very pretty though, fit great, very soft, and warmer than expected"
5.0,good to have these cleaning clothes around when your silver jewelry needs a buffing!
5.0,I'm going to wear this to my baby shower. I'm 7 months pregnant and 5'8&#34;.  It's long enough and fits well! Super cute as well.
5.0,"These are an amazing bargain. Nice size,pretty and colors to go with many, many outfits. Perfect  !"
5.0,Very pretty necklace and earring set. I bought them to go with a certain outfit but I will be able the wear them with a lot of things because of the neutral color. The earrings are not heavy feeling. I cannot wear a lot of metal necklaces because of nickel content but this set must be hypoallergenic because I have been able to wear them without itching.
5.0,"My Invicta Blue automatic watch review (Model: 27631).<br /><br />To begin with, Invicta is a worthy brand to consider. The company has been around longer than most well renowned watchmakers. The thing about Invicta is that they are not afraid to be bold and different. My experience searching for an Invicta watch, is that I have to filter through most of their styles, many of which work best for men with larger wrist. These watches are great for football players like Jason Taylor No.99 of the Dolphins. He has a series of Invicta watches designed by him. I kept wondering why Invicta had watches named JT with the number 99 at the 9 o‚Äôclock hour ‚Äì so it had to do with that. With that being said, I do end up finding a good selection of Invicta watches that I‚Äôd consider adding to my collection, like this one.<br /><br />My recent addition is this Invicta blue automatic watch. At the time of purchase, it was and still is 59.99. I‚Äôve read reviews from others complaining about the fabric wristband that came with this watch. Let me tell you that you really need to trust those reviews. This has got to be the worst wristband that I‚Äôve ever had. I highly recommend that if you do get this watch to immediately consider switching it to either a Nato type strap, leather band or even a metal band. Anything ‚Äì just don‚Äôt even bother with the strap that it came with. I still consider this to be an excellent purchase. This is a diver watch and an automatic from a decent watch maker at just 60 dollars. If you consider an extra 10 dollars on average for a 22mm replacement band, then you‚Äôre looking at a total of 70 dollars spent for this automatic diver watch that is just extremely beautiful to look at ‚Äì to me, it‚Äôs a great bargain and a great intro into the world of automatics. I‚Äôll add photos which will include the watch with a black leather band, an18mm blue/red stripe strap (pins will still show but if that doesn‚Äôt bother you‚Äì still works fine), and a Ritche 22mm NATO strap. I‚Äôm wearing the NATO strap in a non-traditional way ‚Äì if interested in that ‚Äì take a look at YouTube video called ‚ÄòOver-Under//The Ultimate NATO Strap Technique‚Äô (just my preference).<br /><br />Go on vacation with it. If it‚Äôs lost or stolen, it‚Äôs not such a terrible loss compared to a Rolex or Omega being stolen (their prices are beyond me at this point in my life). If held at gunpoint, I‚Äôd say please just take my Invicta. If it were a Rolex or Omega, I might risk my life. Who needs that stress. Thank you, Invicta.<br /><br />So even with the terrible fabric band that this watch came with, I would still give it a 5 start review.<br /><br />To be honest, I‚Äôve only owned it now for a few days. So far, it‚Äôs keeping perfect time. I‚Äôm not a diver and will only be using this on occasion for informal or semi-formal events.<br /><br />The only other con for me besides the wrist band, is that it has a saucer shape to it where the lug ends of the watch are high up and do not hug close to the wrist as much as I would like. Other than that, I am very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've only been using a 22mm dark blue leather quick release leather strap from Fullmosa (currently on Amazon for 11.99). Very comfortable.  I gave up on the NATO straps that work better for my Seiko field watch. Adding a picture with the Fullmosa strap."
5.0,I. Love. The. Sunglasses. They. Work. Great

5.0,"So happy with this purchase! It fits snug on body in a good way, and is stretchy and comfortable. I ordered a Medium which is my usual size and it fits great."
5.0,Good looking band that fits well. More of a suede feel than leather. Came on time without delay.
5.0,Todo perfecto.
5.0,A cute dress with quality lace.  Appeared to be well made.  Would benefit from a crinoline to maximize the full skirt.  Bodice was a little tight compared to the shoulder width.  Length was appropriate for 5‚Äô6‚Äù frame.
5.0,So pretty and soft. I wrap my hair with it all night.
5.0,"The sleeves aren't as long as on the model and the shirt is a little longer than a crop top. Although I may have a long torso since I am 5'10&#34;. When I wear this shirt, I receive many compliments"
5.0,"Nice, warm but not thick. The leg part is not binding."
5.0,POCKETS! These are like sneaky-soft on the inside. Super soft and aren't bulky from the fleece. I wish it wasn't so hot outside so I could wear them more. I've washed them about a dozen times now and they still look brand new.
5.0,This is absolutely beautiful and well made. Highly recommend!
5.0,"These are exactly what I needed. I pair these, under my exercise clothing, with the padded bike seat that I got for my Peloton and the combo is perfect. No pain at all. I tried them without the padded bike seat and they worked great too. They fit under my existing clothing. High quality, great fit and function."
5.0,Amazing. Literally perfect. This is my new go-to brand. Why pay $80 for yoga pants that are almost exactly the same!?
5.0,I love these shoes.  So much that I ordered black as well as white.  I have a wide foot so they fit perfectly.
5.0,"Super soft, super cute, and comfy!"

5.0,I use this for my eyeliners and concealers.  Such a great pouch.  I'm sure it can hold a child's pencils for school as well.  Well worth the price.
5.0,true to color<br />soft and cool
5.0,They run large. I had to return to find that out but it was  worth the wait.

5.0,Retro. Very classy
5.0,"I love these Fixgear shirts. They're breathable, so it almost feels as though I'm not wearing a shirt at all. At the same time, they keep me warm in the winter. The patterns on the shirts are unique and exciting"
5.0,i loved this flips flop cause they were sturdy and non slip and my dad loved them that i bought him a pair as well definitely worth the buy.
5.0,Stunning beautiful love. So many words for this gorgeous set of earrings. Must buy she will love it. I got it on a real good deal. Still worth the original price

5.0,"I normally wouldn't buy this type of hat, but since I have complex skin and need to be careful with sun exposure, I thought I should try it. It gives such good sun protection. It is exactly what I was looking for. It's pretty and gives some good shade not only to the face and chest but the shoulders as well. It was shipped fast, and it was well packed. I recommend it to any woman who wants some extra protection from the sun and still looks cute."
5.0,"These are so comfortable!  I usually buy Acorn slippers, but didn't see any that I liked, so I tried these.  These are just as comfortable and cheaper in price.  Win, win."
5.0,I love this coat. It fits true to size and looks amazing on.
5.0,"I ride a bicycle outside in the sun, and this helps with protection."
5.0,"This dress is really pretty. I'm around 5'7"" and 130, 27 waist, and size M fit like something tailored. It really is a well-made dress."
5.0,Nice little gadget!
5.0,"Love these! They're soft, warm, comfy and they fit very well."
5.0,My baby girl looks so cute in this! I is excellent quality and fits perfectly!
5.0,I have several of these shirts in different colors and everyone fits exactly the same.  They are lightweight and perfect for workouts and/or running.  The colors stay vibrant after dozens of washes.  The variety of colors allows me to mix and match with my work out pants. I love these shirts! I have 7 of them in different colors.
5.0,"I bought this chain to replace my daughter's necklace that I broke.  It's just the right length for a child's necklace and is very sparkly, perfect for her small heart charm.  Great price too!"
5.0,"Really nice watch, pretty heafty as well. The metal is a little weird looking more a chromium look but really nice definitely would recommend and buy again."
5.0,"At less that $20, teh fit, quality, durability, and appearance of these shirts is hard-to-bit. Combined with no-iron  qualities, I'm not sure that you can beat these. They are stylish enough to be seen in an upscale &#34;casual&#34; restaurant and sturdy enough to use for travel. The size L is equivalent to a 16/34 moderately-fitted dress shirt. I just wish that they had a wider variety."
5.0,"Great quality, thermal material really good jacket for ride bike in wintertime."
5.0,I love this watch I have reordered it several times. I have small wrist and this watch fits perfectly
5.0,"The charge doesn't last a full school day, and it is hard to connect the charger to the shoes, but they are amazing!!! So many color options!!"
5.0,Used with a cheap shark army watch. Looks more expensive than it is with a bracelet. This is my second ritche bracelt. The first was used with a casio duro. Note is not a perfect fit you need to bend the two tabs that holds the spring bar.
5.0,Love the dress! Used the dresses for my wedding!
5.0,"Purchased these as a gift for my father and he loved them! The color is vibrant, fabric is sturdy, and the price was great!"
5.0,Awesome little product
5.0,"A stylish take on the Maxie skirt. Comfy, cool, versatile. üëç"
5.0,not as big as i hoped. still good
5.0,Its fits perfect and its long like I love it. Long flowing and beautiful mesh material on top of the silk underneath lining. Its just straight up gorgeous.
5.0,I love these! I wear them folded to add an extra stylish flare to the look.<br /><br />My foot is US 6.5 and they fit true to size & comfortably. Highly recommend!
5.0,Great pin!
5.0,I am very susceptible to cancer on my nose so this hat really covers my nose well it seems like my nose got burnt when I was a kid because it‚Äôs always been touchy. So this is a nice cover.
5.0,Bought this the same time as Katmai EXpedtion Bottom.  See that review.
5.0,"Great half the price from last year, and a better house slipper!"
5.0,"Ears fit well, were about double the size of a normal ear, large but didnt weigh you down. Were so funny to have on as a troll."
5.0,i bought it for my nephew's birthday gift. he said it looks so cool. it was heavy raining two days ago. so he took it to ski on the mountain. then he told me it is the best one he has ever used. it is very comfortable and keep warm. i am very happy he loves it.
5.0,"Love the flowy and soft fabric, great fit and comfortable!"
5.0,I love this sweater so much I ordered two
5.0,"Fantastic! Very well made! It does run large. Doe not glow under black lights as i would have hoped, BUT  you sand out in any other light!"
5.0,The fabric of these onesies is very comfortable and the quality of the colors are great. Nice and vibrant.
5.0,This dress was a beautiful color and had just the right amount of stretch!
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 195 lbs and I typically wear large in just about everything due to my muscular build. I ordered large and they are a little tight around my chest and back, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm jacked. Ordering another pack in XL. Definitely would recommend though!"
5.0,Ordered a medium for my boyfriend and it fit perfectly. Fitted but not too tight and the perfect amount of space for mobility. Definitely would buy again!
5.0,The scarf is truly as described .... thin for spring and summer wear.  My MIL loved it and has several outfits to wear it with.
5.0,"I just ordered a second pair of these. That's how much I love them. They've only been washed once, and by hand, but when wearing them for the third day in a row, they are holding their form as if just washed. No looseness in the knees, as with my others. With leg warmers, they are perfect for every day wear. I'm a tad under 5'3'/110 pounds and an XS is perfect. They ride on the calf as pictured. The waist is snug, and stays snug, high enough so there is no muffin top. Yay!!! When I first tried them on I thought the waist would be too tight, but it has more give than expected, so super comfy."
5.0,Perfect for hiding it at work. Comfortable. I suggest it to everyone i know tht is looking for one. :)
5.0,Lasted me three years
5.0,"These are pretty much the bees knees. I'm driving to Texas on Friday and wasn't sure they'd get here on time but I sure am glad they did. I have no idea how I'd navigate those complicated southern and midwestern social mores without them.<br /><br />I read a lot of reviews complaining about the lack of visibility when you wear these. All I can say is, if you can see well enough to take a selfie to post on facebook so your hipster friends can seethe in quiet jealousy over your possibly not ironic awesomeness you can see well enough."
5.0,The kimono holds the same quality as the first time I bought it. It's still super cute and chic. Bought it as a Christmas gift!
5.0,These socks seem to be idea!  My husband  is very hard to shop for regarding socks.  He usually will clip the top edge or cut off the  top  1&#34; edge all together.  This pair is comfortable top to toe!  So comfortable that we are ordering more!
5.0,Better than expected.
5.0,love the design.
5.0,Do not hesitate to buy it.. size runs well good quality. Really comfortable..
5.0,Perfect for teacher gifts.  Ladies all loved them.
5.0,Purchased for my 13 yo son for grad pics. It was nice looking and simple enough to use especially that neither of us are good at making the knots. Stays neat under the collar. Length was just right on his 5‚Äô7‚Äù frame. Not sure how will be on someone much taller.
5.0,"Brown watch 22mm fits, looks nice and functions well.  Very attractive and leather quality is top notch.  Clasp works well, not to loose.  Perfect for my Citizen Eco."
5.0,"great item, highly recommended"
5.0,It‚Äôs very soft and I like that it comes down to my mid calf. I did not realize it had pockets-pleasant surprise. I washed it before wearing. No shrinking.
5.0,I usually wear size M but for this I took L and it was perfect
5.0,"Nice soft fabric, very comfy. Flattering fit, as others have mentioned top button is a little low in placement but not an issue."
5.0,Used these in the snow and they kept my hands dry and warm. The pointer save thumb fingers show you to use a touch screen device which is great.
5.0,Worthy of of the lit award<br /><br />U got a litty
5.0,"Fabulous and sophisticated, I will use these ears for my Halloween costume. Veil covers my eyes just fine, ears are wire frame so can be adjusted to any liking, loose threads can be cut with scissors. I did not expect superb quality in $4 costume part, so these sexy ears will hold well for the purpose they're intended."
5.0,Really like the shirt very comfortable
5.0,Love it love it!!!!!
5.0,love this necklace. Its just what I wanted. Thank YOU!!
5.0,"Very nice sweater, fiance loves it"
5.0,It's more beautiful then pics fiance loved it hope to find it in different colors down the road for her
5.0,"I love how understated this top is, yet it is full of style with a unique cut.  The slit in the arms makes it a perfect summer top for work!"
5.0,It did fit somewhat small but it worked out fine. This was such great quality that I will be ordering again in a larger size because I absolutely loved how this looked on my daughter.
5.0,Bought this for a Mother‚Äôs Day gift with our Childrens names and birthstones. She wears it daily and hasn‚Äôt taken it off since. since I‚Äôm great shape the durability is great. The stones are beautiful. Great for the price.
5.0,"Too small, I will order a larger size later."
5.0,This is a great dress. I'm 5'4 and 175lbs I originally purchased an XL but it was really big on me. So I re-ordered it in a Large and it fit great! I did need to stitch the top portion as it was way to low cut for me. And I also had to stitch down the dress because the split on the bottom went up so high when I was sitting you could see my lady parts. LOL after a few alterations the dress was fabulous and was worth every dollar. I was complimented all evening and just felt very beautiful.
5.0,Very nice and colorful boxer briefs which fit great and very comfortable.
5.0,One of my favorite dresses. I'm short and heavy so I was afraid it wouldn't be flattering but it's quite stretchy and very flattering.
5.0,"Love this little wallet! Purchased on lightening deal & was pleasantly surprised. Would gladly pay full price for this wallet. It is wide, but carries all my cards & other eallet necessities grest! Love the double zipper!"
5.0,"Came on time, nicely packaged with batteries.  I've been looking for a ct. scale along with grams to weigh my gemstones.  Perfect."
5.0,"Product was what I was looking for, except it was too small."
5.0,This swimsuit fit great
5.0,"This necklace looks so expensive and heavy but in all reality it is very light and didn't cost that much, can't wait to wear it."
5.0,I love these yoga pants! They are comfy and are not  see-through. The pockets make it even better when working out!
5.0,I love my ray bans! I treated myself for my 40th birthday and  splurged! Great fit and great look! So happy I splurged!
5.0,The package was delivered

5.0,Todo OK
5.0,great fit. look terrific
5.0,"These fit perfect, are so comfortable, and of great quality! Thank you!"
5.0,"They are so beautiful and shimmery. Depending upon the lights and angle, they show glimmering hues of blue, tangerine, fuchsia, etc. I wish I could find a matching ring, but there are many colors of rings you could wear with these vivid colors. Very lightweight, easy to wear."
5.0,This is a nice hat. It's sort of a mesh like material. Color is outstanding. Bought it for a costume and it's works great.
5.0,"Love these sunglasses. Fits over my plastic framed eyeglasses and looks so stylish!!  I bought two pair, two colors. Both are fabulous!!"

5.0,Worked great. Perfect for my sister's cell phone
5.0,These fit a little larger than expected. I will order the next smaller size next time.
5.0,"Exactly like the picture!! I'm usually a size XS, slim 90 lbs and 4'10, but I got the S and I loveeee the slightly looser fit. Jacket came in perfect condition and NO chemical smell like some other people have unfortunately experienced. It's a thin jean jacket but still the feel of an actual jacket. Perfect for summer. Such a great quality jean jacket for so cheap I can't believe it wow!! I'm glad it was worth my money as I'm on a budget lol. I'm obsessed!!"
5.0,Ordering another one in a different color.
5.0,My husband loves these..... they were thicker than I expected
5.0,Very nice fit. Doesn‚Äôt wrinkle. Very comfortable and flattering. I was very happy with this sweater.
5.0,"Nice set of bands for style variety. Fastening to arm is different than other buckle type bands, but the adjustment is good."
5.0,I will be buying several more of these jackets for storage i am a prepper i believe in being prepared for the worst. having the full 7 layer ecwcs clothing system is a necessary essential for survival in cold climates/Winter time. for all those who dont no this is the 6th layer out of the 7 layer military system. Known as ECWCS = (Extended cold weather clothing system). And yes this jacket is waterproof.

5.0,Nice fit and comfortable.
5.0,"I only needed two. Don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôll replace all the straps I have at home then."
5.0,"Good quality sock.  I‚Äôm highly satisfied with this purchase.  Would have liked to have size options available, but they were able to stretch to fit different sizes."
5.0,"I wish it came in adult, the cutest!"
5.0,"This thing is exquisite, with amazing craftsmanship. And for a great price!"

5.0,The pieces stayed on well. I used them to create charmed bracelets and the project came out nicely.
5.0,Easy to adjust and comfortable
5.0,"I loved it! It was missing one of the snaps at the bottom, but that's no biggy. I'm going to replace both with hook and eye anyway. Just feels safer :)"
5.0,"Love this umbrella!  It's extremely compact and sturdy.  It's exactly what I've been looking for, especially for travel."
5.0,I keep forgetting that I‚Äôm even wearing this ring. Does not feel like I‚Äôm wearing anything on my finger and I love it!
5.0,"I got this cool hoodie as a gift for my BF. It fits him well, and he loves the pattern. He likes wearing it on top of this t-shirt at home.<br /><br />Just a note: you got what you paid for, so do not expect the material of this hoodie to be comparable to the Bape ones. It works great as a hoodie~"
5.0,These are really pretty and look a lot more expensive than they were.  Great purchase
5.0,"Very nice quality made bag for travel or just on the go. This has a lot of room inside and has compartments to keep everything secure and in its place, I was amazed at all the things that I could fit in this bag But still is small enough to take along with you with no problem. The zipper is good quality heavy zipper and has a handle to carry easily. a very stylish travel bag."

5.0,Nice mask. It‚Äôs comfortable to wear and fits nicely with the adjustable ear straps.
5.0,Love these pads. Just enough padding and fit perfect.
5.0,"These are great to keep little feet warm, not hard soled booties so is more so for at home or making a quick trip out type of shoe. They are stitched like moccasins and they stay on my 15 month olds feet, which is a miracle! Love them so much I got her another pair the next size up!"
5.0,"This bracelet is very pretty! It is so sparkly, that it appears to glow in certain lighting. The silver part is made of stainless steel, giving it a real sturdiness."
5.0,I like the quality and fit of this shirt. I wear a size 8 and ordered a medium and it is perfect.
5.0,"Used this product for yoga and fashion. Fabulous!! Perfect fit! I am 5'4 145lbs and brought a lg in size in these pants. They are perfect fit and roomy. They are very good quality material made, you can't go wrong witb these, great buy!"
5.0,They are a little thicker than other toe socks and they come up higher than most other toe socks.
5.0,Got it for my mom and she loved it.
5.0,I just received these and I love them! The quality is so much better than I anticipated. These glasses are so nice! I'm going to wear them all the time.
5.0,Material is stretchy and thick. It is the kind of material that picks up dust but still a nice dress for work
5.0,Love this hat..perfect for beach and outdoors..
5.0,"I bought a brand name multifunctional headwear, and this no-name headwear to compare. Though I do like the print on this one, it came with an ugly white stripe up the middle of it. It's obvious that there was a wrinkle in the material when the pattern was printed, which left a big section of the headwear white and unprinted. The worst part is, the white misprint sticks out like a sore thumb...... no matter how you wear it.<br /><br />Update: Seller immediately reached out to me and offered a full refund on my headwear and made me more than 100% whole. That, folks, is how you do business. Not only do I recommend Tough Outfitters, I'm certain I will order from them again in the near future. Thank you Tough Outfitters !"
5.0,"I‚Äôve used this type of wallet for a few years, and needed a replacement. This one has more slots and pockets than my old one, helping with the few cards I trimmed down to from a traditional wallet.<br /><br />Fits better in a jacket or front pocket, and with the extra space I can stash the bigger bills (that I don‚Äôt want to flash to the public when pulling it out) out of sight."
5.0,I‚Äôm always leery about ordering costume online because of the size charts. But I looked at reviews and figured out what size I thought I‚Äôd be. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and 175 pounds.  I got an XL and it fit great. I wasn‚Äôt tight on me. It was a cozy little dress.
5.0,"I like that there was a removable link, and it was a unique band from others id seen"
5.0,"Most PattyBoutik products are very body-conscious, which I prefer, but I don't like to look or feel like a stuffed sausage either. So, if you're quite trim and/or have a solid physique (lower body fat), I would recommend this. I got this top in my usual size (M) (also got the purple) and they fit beautifully and look very sharp. Very soft and comfortable. The sleeves ARE long, but I'd rather have them too long than too short. I'm 5'5"" and about 155#."
5.0,"These are exactly what I was looking for. So much better quality then what you find in the store, sizes seem spot on."
5.0,I got this as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter who absolutely loves it.
5.0,"I AM TALL, THIS IS LONG BUT PERFECT. POLY MATERIAL. VERY MOVEABLE LOVE IT"
5.0,Love it! Was exactly what I wanted.
5.0,Awesome my son in law love it he watch that show
5.0,Perfect fit. Good quality material
5.0,love it! Fits great!
5.0,I likes that when you put the glasses on everything is so red and makes outside look even more amazing and there is nothing that I don‚Äôt like about the glasses
5.0,I am VERY happy with the quality. I got them for my fairway drivers. The tab/tag is also made of good quality plastic so I'm expecting these to last me a VERY long time. Love the fact I can change them to whatever number I want as my fairway drivers are a hodgepodge mix and I am still learning so expect to be replacing what I have as I get better and get a better idea of what clubs work best for me.
5.0,This dress is the best clothing purchase I have ever made on Amazon. It fits true to size with a cut and material that are forgiving and flattering. I am wearing it to a holiday ballet performance and I was nervous about finding something that made me feel good. This dress is a winner all around and at an amazingly affordable price! I love the green color. The material had a bit of a sheen to it if that is of concern to some. Could be dressed up or down as needed.
5.0,Love them! Great materials and very nice fitting!
5.0,"Is the most incredible sandal for walk in the beach and for the street, is very confort and buy it twice... I recommended don‚Äôt submerge them in water many times because the leather can damage and leave to looking good."
5.0,Love the hat!
5.0,Ordered the white and love that they are a ‚Äútrue‚Äù white. The medium is a nice comfortable fit. They wash and dry well. Did dry them on low heat.
5.0,I absolutely love it but it was bigger than what I was expecting
5.0,Buy the darn bag
5.0,"Nice sweater, good wool"
5.0,Very computable and cool. Wish I can buy many different color.
5.0,Just what I needed to keep track of the multiple keys I use on a daily basis. Love the style and functionality!
5.0,"Very, very, very nicely done; new 'Mommy' I'm sure will love this charm."
5.0,"I LOVE these!  I was definitely not expecting this sort of quality with a product bought from Amazon (sorry).  The leggings are  very thick, and the material feels like a very nice quality.  There was a tag on these that said &#34;MSRP $98&#34; and I believe it!  It feels like something you'd buy in a high end shop, or a specialty fitness store.<br /><br />The only thing to keep in mind is that these feel quite tight.  I would definitely recommend going up a size.  I bought a size larger and they felt very fitted, so I think the sizing is one notch off."
5.0,I have purchased several of these because they are sturdy and comfortable. I use them around the house and yard to avoid breaking them if they fall off.
5.0,A lot !
5.0,"What  I got was marked 'new', but the packaging had clearly been opened before and there was tape holding the label and box together. The squishy was also yellowed, and not clear like advertised, but it doesn't make sense to pay to send it back..<br /><br />Updated 12/9/19: Hamee customer service was amazing in responding to me. They apologized for the used condition I received my first one in, and replaced it. The replacement I received was definitely new, and I really appreciate Hamee's support and diligence. I love this little squishy a ton!"
5.0,Great quality these socks really helped me through my 3rd trimester
5.0,"He loves it! Wears it all the time. It matches his school uniform colors. Great buy! Not pilling either, and I wash it just about every other day!"
5.0,Love it love it love it.
5.0,My hubby loves it being that he works out side
5.0,Fine product. Fits the larger wrist well.
5.0,Purchased these for my husband.He loves them and they fit him good.
5.0,Great purse just ordered the wrong color
5.0,Love these! Bought for $5. Anyone with big feet (I'm size 17) knows that the price generally skyrockets the bigger your feet are. Cheap and good quality. Couldn't ask for more.
5.0,"The large fits me every well. I like the fit, material and everything about that I have bought 6 so far."
5.0,Exceeds expectations
5.0,Great little t-shirt. My daughter loves it.
5.0,love these. They fit well and are comfortable. Can't beat the price
5.0,"These are very comfortable Viscatas and look good with any &#34;every day&#34; outfit. I wear them with jeans, skirts, informal dresses, pants. They are also &#34;well made&#34; , mine got wet in the rain a couple of times and look intact üëåüèº"
5.0,"I bought this tactical backpack set for my husband to carry his tools in, because he doesn‚Äôt have a tool box for his truck. The multiple pockets are perfect, the straps make it comfortable to carry, and the small pack is handy to remove and use separately."
5.0,"I have purchased many, many items from Zenergy Gems. However, this is an all time favorite. Not only is it uniquely beautiful, but the energy is powerful. I highly recommend this one."
5.0,They were great!  My granddaughter loved them.
5.0,Very nice and get a lot of compliments wearing it!!!
5.0,Love love love. Im 5‚Äô7 around 190. Xl. Lose enough to be comfortable but snug enough to show curves. I bought this for work but it shows some cleavage but easily fixed with a pin or shirt underneath. Down to my knees. Super soft!
5.0,"Bought these for my little cow boy. They look great and have held up well. He wears the almost every day, from preschool to church. They clean up easily and have held up beautifully."
5.0,Love them! Come with filters if you want one. Soft an breathable an so cute! I love it! My hubby stole the white one lol so perfect for him too!
5.0,Bought this as a birthday gift for my husband.  Something to use for Fall golf.  He really likes it and it fits great.  Love the sage green color with the white trim.  Gives it a classy sharp look and it has a nice weight and structure to it.  And it‚Äôs sooo soft.  Really nice purchase and I‚Äôll probably get a 2nd one.
5.0,I had bought one previously and fell in love with it so much I had to get another one!!
5.0,"I was offered this product free for review.  My husband has a great deal of pain in his wrist as a result of an old accident that created the need for a number of surgeries including a bone graft.  As he gets older, it hurts more and more constantly.  He doesn't really like taking pain pills all the time so he frequently just bears with it.  When this bracelet arrived he put it on (it was a pretty tight fit though).  Over the next few days he not only had his regular activites, he also had one day when he drove for several hours on the highway - something that generally causes him a considerable amount of pain.  He tells me his wrist hasn't hurt a bit for days.  He's very pleased! He has tried the copper bracelets previously, and while they help, he still has some pain.  This seems to stop the pain completely.<br /><br />EDIT:  I was later offered another version of this same bracelet - the brushed steel colored one.  I am not sure if you can order a specific version since all the reviews are lumped together.  Again, we found it worked - however the &#34;silver&#34; bracelet was a larger size and fits him better than the copper one.  Because of this he wears the silver one now, and gave the copper one to me.  I didn't expect much as my pain originates in a neck injury that pinches a nerve that runs down my right arm.  To my surprise, this bracelet does help with the pain in my arm. We're believers!"
5.0,Good quality. I like it.
5.0,Very warm and comfortable.  Just don't try to back up.  they have no heel restraints.
5.0,"Stunning, fun and funky."
5.0,Still holding strong and no issues.
5.0,"Nice, peplum shirt great color"
5.0,Calidad esperada
5.0,No complaints..It fits my needs.
5.0,Love this dress it's super flattering even on someone like me who has a baby pooch from having two kids... It hides well and is sexy and comfortable. I will say it runs kind of big you can definitely afford to size down as it is super stretchy. For reference I am normally a size 10 about 165 and 5'5 I am narrow up too with 34d breasts but I have a belly and thick legs and legs I usually wear a medium or large depending on the style and fit I bought a medium in this dress and j honestly could have bought a small and kind of wish I did as I think it would have hugged my butt a little more lol... I think I might buy another one in a different color.
5.0,just as pictured and I finally win.
5.0,I loved this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è fit great glove looks real and hat looks awesome.
5.0,Dazzling blingy bracelet! Love it!
5.0,My 10 year old nice absolutely loved it!! She thought it was the Best present ever.
5.0,Bought this Spirit jersey along with &#34;Another brand&#34; for my 23 yo daughter. She loves this one and not the other. Perfect length and the material is soft and not rough like the other one. She is 5'6 and 145lb. I ordered the Medium.
5.0,As advertised.  Nice.
5.0,"The product is very sofy and very comfortable. The package they come in was very easy to open. Additionally, they wash very easily without any negative side effects."
5.0,I loved these bracelets! The quality was even better than I expected. The metal is thick but light weight and the engraving is very well done!
5.0,Fit perfectly & great color!
5.0,Looked great but the fit was small I gave it to my daughter she loves it
5.0,love them! I lost my silver pair. I loved them so much I bought a whole new set. These are my go to earrings.
5.0,I needed decent size hoops for work and let me just say wow these hoops are even better in person.üòç They‚Äôre so lightweight and honestly a perfect size. Can‚Äôt beat the price
5.0,I love the knot material it‚Äôs not the cheap fabrics it‚Äôs a good and comfy material! Fits well!
5.0,This dress is really cute. It is a nice soft fabric that is a good weight and not see through at all. I am 5'1&#34; size medium/large and the medium fits perfectly. It hangs nicely and is flattering- tighter over the bust and hangs over/hides my mom-tummy. It is longer on me than the model- a few inches above my knees. I ordered the red and it is bright and pretty. I highly reccommend.
5.0,"My husband's old wallet was falling apart and was almost 2 inches thick!  He carries his wallet in his front pocket, also, and it was always a challenge to retrieve.  He loves this wallet!  It holds a lot but it's so thin."
5.0,I needed some different glasses that are cute and big. I saw these and knew they were the find. I have them but they should have come with a case
5.0,Great pair of glasses üëì so cute!
5.0,Love the product. Super soft material and high quality. Fits true to size.
5.0,Perfect for the occastion
5.0,Cute and casual. Very comfortable. Ordered a small at 5‚Äô6‚Äù 130lbs. Fits as expected. Dark green color is accurate.
5.0,"I'm very pride with this article, it's really beautiful!"
5.0,I got so many compliments
5.0,"Top! I bought it according to the measure of my glasses and it was excellent!  I took the measurement before to see which one was better.  This is not that huge clip.  For those who depend on glasses, it is an excellent cost benefit!  See the photos."
5.0,"My fiance and I took this with us to the beach this summer and it was perfect. There was enough room for our towels, sunblock, thing to put down on the beach to sit, and phones in the top and the bottom held  a couple drinks and snacks, along with an ice pack to keep them cool. Definitely recommend!<br /><br />If you have kids you might need 2 but it held more than I was expecting."
5.0,"Little big, but nothing the dryer can't fix. Super soft material, love it. It also arrived sooner then i thought it would."
5.0,Love the mask. Didn't like that the metal piece wasn't already on and I had to do it. But over all very happy.
5.0,"The shirt fit as expected and looked exactly like the photo. I got the gray one, size Large. The fabric is soft and stretchy, very comfortable. I wish they had the pink when I bought this- it's so cute!<br /><br />It was the perfect length and fit, as I like my shirt to be flattering, but not too tight and long enough to hit below the hip. This shirt fit the bill! People love the messaging too. It's a fun conversation piece! Buy it- you won't regret it!<br /><br />For size reference- I'm about 5'4, 36DD and around 190lbs at the time of purchase."
5.0,Very dainty and matches everything.
5.0,A little bulky but seems to be made well. Shipped slow but was to be expected. Lava beads absorb oils well but not too overpowering. Would purchase again or as a gift.
5.0,Stance are just amazing socks. This design is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Very vibrant colors and the durability is why I‚Äôm such a fan of this brand.
5.0,Nice!!! Just wore it today to work out and it felt like I had nothing on. I look that it is somewhat fitted but isn't too restrictive.
5.0,I absolutely love it and it arrived fast!
5.0,"Ordered these for my 3 year old grandson. He loves them. They do run small. I ordered a size 5 (he wears 3-4). These fit perfect after washing. No growing room, as I had hoped."
5.0,Very nice fit.<br />Thought the bell would be bigger but its a nice size and it tingle lings!
5.0,"Wow. This is one of the most amazing dresses I have bought for my wife and it's an instant favorite. COVID-19 is forcing us to have at-home dates but that hasn't stopped us from dressing up for each other and dining in.<br /><br />Ladies, do yourselves and your men a favor and skip the shapewear and bra. This dress holds you in place exceptionally well and skipping those garments means no interruption to the evening progression.<br /><br />Cant wait for her to wear this on our next social/outside date!"
5.0,"I love, love, love this bag! It is the exact size I was looking for and the strap is perfectly long! I am 5' 10 and always find that the straps on bags aren't long enough especially if you wear them as cross body bags but this is perfect! I love the size as well and the material is really high quality canvas and leather. I have already received compliments on this bag. It is a casual bag and can be great for traveling as well! Super all around bag."
5.0,"Love the silky feeling against my face, and pinches at the nose"
5.0,"This is a lovely piece of jewellery. I bought it for my daughter, she loves our little dog, and was delighted to receive this. It looks great on it‚Äôs own or she sometimes wears it with other silver necklaces. It‚Äôs a subtle piece of jewellery with meaning."
5.0,"I love this romper, it's very flattering, nice and lightweight fabric. Unfortunately if you're a busty woman like me (36 DD) doesn't work because it shows too much flesh on the sides, unless that you are fine with thatüòâ"
5.0,"It looks just like the picture and because it is all one long piece, it can fit anyone."
5.0,"Really nice watch band. Beautiful leathery smell. A bit on the thick side, but not a bad thing. I carelessly bought the wrong size at first but the exchange was painless."
5.0,Love the style. I wear the with casual as well as business attire
5.0,"My daughter loves this hat, it is warm and fun!!"
5.0,I love them I just wished they were bigger
5.0,did the job and was beautiful wish they had more sizes and colors.  Soft comfortable!
5.0,"Great color (mint). I was expecting it to be more conservative attire but it is more sexy. More club wear or Saturday night date wear, not work wear."
5.0,Very good for cold weather running!
5.0,"I was literally about to click on the return button!<br /><br />The rose gold stoppers are very pretty but extremely difficult to insert onto an authentic Pandora snake bracelet. It took me an hour and a lot of force to get the stoppers to pass through (refer to image). My index finger and thumb are in a lot of pain, but for right now, I can say it was worth the hassle.<br /><br />I‚Äôm rating 5 stars for now. And will update in 3 months to see how they hold up.<br /><br />Update 08/06/2020<br />The stoppers are holding up in color and shape but I do not wear the bracelet everyday. Still like it and will retain the 5-star rating."
5.0,"it was very comfy and I wore it for years, but as all good things do, it finally came to an end one day and broke in half. Looks good on and really did enjoy it.  Must have lasted probably 5 or more years before breaking...most of the time I've lost a toe ring before then!"
5.0,A real hit with my Grandsons. They are young and are happy which makes me happy. Way to go. :)
5.0,Cute dress and fit well with good quality for the price . Grand daughter loves it !
5.0,"This dress is very cute and flattering. As a plus size girl, it's sometimes difficult to find dresses that fit well without looking frumpy. This dress has a flattering waist band and the added perk of pockets! The only thing I can say that was a bit strange is there is no tag whatsoever. However, that really doesn't matter to me, I just have to pay a bit more attention before I slip it on."
5.0,"Love this dress I always get compliments,  I have the blue with flowers, so I ordered the white with flowers not the same material and doesn't wear the same. Also I'm 5'5 and it's a true maxi the bottom is just above the ground, it has adjustable straps if you are shorter"
5.0,"I do use this product for - b -day gift .I do love this purse !!! Excellent art work ,craftsmanship...love it !!!"
5.0,"So cute. I ordered the size medium and they fit my face (which I always assumed was heart-shaped according to those silly charts) and look good in my humble opinion. My boyfriend even sat on them once and they seemed to hold up pretty well. Haha! Anywho, once they do break or I lose them I will for sure be purchasing again because these are just too cute and fun."
5.0,"I love this hat!  Bluetooth works great. This hat is fleece lined and not to tight. Usually my head will itch like crazy from wearing hats, but I could wear this all day, and there is no itching."
5.0,"Very satisfied with my purchase, I bought four."
5.0,This was a wonderful sweater a little bit more snug than I would expect but most of all a really good fit. I hoped for a little bit more of a v-neck but overall I like Patty boutiques quality and I would definitely buy again. I have many of her sweaters.
5.0,"I bought a size up because I prefer an easier fit.  That said, they have a compression feel so they still are fitted.  The material is a good thickness so no unsightly bulges or outline of one‚Äôs lower area.  The cell phone pocket is suitable for smaller phones although still functional for the larger versions they will stick out of the pocket.  I wear these for running errands or walking my dogs."
5.0,Great glasses for a great price.
5.0,"Very cute little bows that fit our daughter well and are not too big or bulky.  She is 3 months old and they fit her tight enough to stay on her head well, but not tight enough to bother her.  We love that there's a color to match every outfit!"
5.0,I Absolutely love it‚ò∫Ô∏è
5.0,I thought about ordering a Medic Alert bracelet but instead bought the cuff that goes on my smart watch. I uploaded all my information easily. I love how each item can be loaded with pertinent info. I bought this kit for a trip I'm taking later this year.  Better than Air tags imo
5.0,I wear a lot of silver jewelry and this is absolutely great for keeping it clean and shiny bright.  Buy it!
5.0,"I have a few other sun protection fishing (or in my case hiking) caps and in Arizona, they are an absolute necessity if you're going to spend a lot of time in the sun. Many people walk around in baseball caps and believe that they are protected but three areas that are very high risk for skin cancer are the top of the ears, the neck, and the nose. This won't protect your nose (well, maybe a tiny bit depending on where the sun is) but it will certainly protect your ears and your neck. When we first moved to AZ I noticed that most landscapers, who are out in the sun all day, wear this type of hat.<br /><br />What's nice about this particular hat is that it is very lightweight and it is so light and can be folded so small, that it is not an extra burden to be placed in my knapsack, so it will always be there if I need it. That also means that as it gets dark, I'm not compelled to wear it just to save room in my bag.<br /><br />Compared to some other similar hats, this hat folds up very easily. Some hats have a stiffer brim which could be a benefit sometimes but for me, it's nice that this will roll up without the brim taking on permanent creases.<br /><br />The hat has, as many other similar models have, a mesh band for airflow along the top which helps reduce sweating a bit. It also has a cord with an adjusting lock so that it can be made tighter and fit better. I might note that I don't have a large head (size 7 hat) and this fits very well without any tightening, which means that it might be a bit small for someone with a larger head. The material is fairly ""stretchy"" so I imagine it will fit heads that are not unusually large or that have a lot of hair but just note that this fit my size 7 head almost perfectly (about 22 inches,  56 cm in diameter).<br /><br />There is a nice thick sweatband which is appreciated, and a neck strap to help keep it from flying off in the wind or on a moving boat.<br /><br />The back flap easily covers my whole neck, my ears and extends forward to about half of the side of my face. The brim is wide enough to cover, as mentioned earlier, my nose depending on the angle and direction of the sun. I would not depend on this to shade my nose but it's nice to know that it will do that sometimes.<br /><br />About the only thing different from some of my much more expensive hats, besides being lighter which I consider a ""plus"" (although those in colder climates may want a heavier hat) is that most of my other hats have a reflecting strip on the back. Now, why I would want something to reflect light when it's a sun hat and not meant to be worn at night, is beyond me but I mention it in case you expect a hat to have a reflector.<br /><br />Good value, and definitely great for warm weather climates where thin and light is a positive attribute."
5.0,"Cute , breathable , stylish :)"
5.0,"I started with the purchase of a  black top and now I‚Äôm on my 3rd purchase. Very comfortable and has a longer length, fits great. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Bought these for my husband. He is 6 ft 1 in tall. These shorts are pretty short on him. Fyi.
5.0,Very cute and very soft.
5.0,Absolutely love this strap. It is absolutely adorable. I have used it on two pairs and it went on well and stayed on perfectly. It is cute with a retro feel.
5.0,Very comfortable and does not wrinkle when seated for any length of time.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:af2e5faf460901e3f39c70cfc65bd763]] Very nice! seals ears very well... Very simple , cut and dry. Wear them to bed , in the house, in the yard , at work, shooting...etc... Go everywhere with them and keep them on your ears by turning up the surround without taking them off . Your hearing is too important.  Feels good on the ears when you put some soft plush  fleece in the ear cups . Feels like hearing protection and ear warmers all in one.Slap on some Camel back Gel Sealing Rings and your good to go. Love those gels.<br /><br /> Update 4/12/16 They are not so great as stereo headphones, just as  ear protection.<br /> So being that the WorkTunes and at least one communication head set has better stereo It gets annoying sometimes because it sounds like a short , and it comes and goes without warning. I've tried to be patient with it, and the cord I got doesn't do a lot of good . the Stereo or surround sounds boxed in. I'm leaving the stars and reviews , just wish the seller would follow through even more , but the WS Alert XPs are great, just a small range of radio stations you can get.<br />Not like WorkTunes ...Even at that they have five stars from me.<br />Update 10/17/16. The short sound has went away. Feel a lot better on my ears, more so with the soft plush fleece lining the ear cups. (Gotta try it) waiting on Pro-Tac III from France. They are very slow at [...] fr. Supposed to have shipped out Pro-Tac III Friday and I see nothing that says they did on my account. I'm thinking about withdrawing my order and getting a refund but hope to get the news today.  If not I'm buying from Earshot.<br /><br />Update 10/30/16<br /><br />The Pro-Tac IIIs arrived, yet they are not as comfortable as the Pro-Tac II. I guess you have to break them in for a longer period.  The Pro Tac IIs and WS Alert XP are by far the most comfortable headsets to wear. There may be others but these I know for sure.  As I said put in some fleece to make it even better. Fleece is water resistant so the material doesn't get sweaty from your ears . You would do very well to buy this headset. I find a pair of the original Pro-Tacs on eBay, and will see if they are any better than their successors . Have a great day and get a pair of Pro-Tacs from Earshot. 2 day shipping ( in most cases)to the US.  Remember that."

5.0,"I got it for my Wedding, only down fall was i didn't have a shirt for the Cuff links and didn't have a jacket for the handkerchief until 10 minutes prior, but my wife and everyone like it.... keeping it around for date nights"
5.0,Great quality and thick fabric.  I wear an XL in all jackets and hoodies.  Should have ordered the XXL.  Buy it you will love it!! GKG!!
5.0,"Love the to, cute"
5.0,Gifted to a friend she loved it.
5.0,"Not as super-snug as a pair of compression shorts I own (different brand). Fits more like a rash guard, loose in the armpit. A size smaller would have fit too short for my liking. Still, it works for it's intended purpose (BJJ)."
5.0,"Delivered quickly, My beautiful lady love bling, and it has a lot of it, she was delighted to get this as a surprise."
5.0,Look these books. So many compliments.

5.0,This credit card holder is exactly what I was looking for
5.0,"I recently purchased some white bras through mail order. When they arrived, the cup size was fine, but they did not fit around. I really did not want to return them, so I intended to go to a retail store and purchase some extenders. Then I saw these offered from Amazon. I am so glad I ordered them. There are five extenders included in the package. They are 100% nylon, and very comfortable to wear. They worked perfectly with my new bras, which now fit just fine.<br /><br />I did purchase these bra extenders at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product. I am very pleased with these extenders, because my bras now fit perfectly. They also arrived several days before the estimated delivery date, which was a very pleasant surprise. I would recommend these to anyone who might need just a little more width to their bras."
5.0,Perfect bag for traveling and it holds an amazing amount of good stuff too!!!
5.0,"I had been using Nike Free runs for over 2 years and it was high time that i got a new pair of running shoes. I was ready to buy a new pair of free's until I stumbled upon these shows on amazon and fell in love. I have slightly small feet so I am down to buying kids sizes since they cost much less than adult sizes. So I decided to give the new boost foam shoes a try and this is my review:<br />_________<br /><br />DESIGN: What can I say about these shoes. They are definitely a looker. The brilliant electric blue color along with the the well accented black and white really do catch your eyes and the eyes of others as well. I have no complaints about the design. I love the blue and they will be the envy of other runners in the track.<br />__________<br /><br />COMFORT: These are a bit heavier and more restricted in movement than my Free Runs but the flexible upper helps in increasing flexibility even though its not a minimalist shoe. This shoe is more of a hybrid between a minimalist and stability shoe. The ankle area is a but tight for me but I am easily adjusting to them. My biggest complaint as far as comfort goes is that they do end up getting hot in the long runs. Please be aware of this.<br />___________<br /><br />CUSHIONING and PERFORMANCE: The boost foam is remarkably pleasant. It really does feel like memory foam for your feet but as far as making my runs more effective, I found no difference between these and my Free Runs which means the performance is great and definitely worth the price that they are being sold for. And the cushioning of course is phenomenal.<br />____________<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I love these shoes and recommend these if you are considering them. Give them a try."
5.0,Great fit nice looking
5.0,"I purchased these for a river trip coming up, I wanted some fun sunglasses :) I was surprised they are actually really nice. They come in a nice protective case with cleaning cloth. They are very sturdy and won't budge easy. The lens seem polarized to me but I'm not 100% but they feel the same as my oakleys when I'm outside in the sun. Overall they are a great pair of sunglasses for the money for sure. In exchange for my honest review I was given a discount on this product."
5.0,The dress was a perfect fit and very comfortable!  It is a somewhat thin though.
5.0,Buy them! I got the regular black ones and they‚Äôre perfect! They fit true to size but I went a size up because I like a looser fit. They‚Äôre so so comfortable and soft and lint/cat hair don‚Äôt stick to them at all! Just ordered the drawstring ones as well :)
5.0,"really cute, warm, good quality"
5.0,"I wrote this for a formal wedding, and felt like the belle of the ball.  Got compliments all night, and the photographer took tons of pictures of me because she loved the dress so much.  Order a size down so that you can take full advantage of the corset back."

5.0,Love this purse! I love the deprecate compartments so it's not just one big bag stuff gets dumped in. Keeps everything organized and it's so cute and stylish. Only thing is I wish the handles were just a little bigger so I could wear it on my shoulder but I still love it so much it don't matter I just it as a hand bag

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:6c148cd73a4ead99dbdc3a65eda28589]] This is as good as the blue mask given out at hospitals.  They are not a guarantee for covid protection, but meets the CDC guidelines for masks.  Be safe and always follow your doctor's orders.  For high risk people these types of mask may Not meet all your medical needs.  However, I like these masks for myself and we supply them to people at our worship services."

Im going to get me some more in every color!  i LOVE it THAT much!  Length is just slightly above the knees and it makes feel feminine and work appropriate while it could be used to run out to store or anywhere. I am 5'7, 180 pounds and I ordered a large and it fits perfectly."

5.0,This mask is literally perfect. Such good quality and a really good fit. So hard to find HIM merch these days and I literally jumped up and down when I opened it! HIGHLY recommend
5.0,"So happy there is a brand that caters to those of us that are not exactly 'proportional'.  I normally wear a 6 1/2 wide shoe, but have bigger calves (around 14 inches) and none of the other compression socks I've seen fit right. Usually, to get something that fits my calves, the foot part is way too big, which defeats the purpose of having a compression sock.<br /><br />I have only been wearing them for about an hour now, but so far they are comfortable and the material is not itchy, like some of the other socks out there. I have poor circulation from a condition called POTS, and I'm also pregnant, so these socks are going to be a lifesaver!  If all goes well, I will definitely be purchasing more from this brand. Will update review as needed."
5.0,Great bag will use often for church
5.0,"Love this shirt! Super comfy and also fits perfectly! I'm just under 5'2 and weigh around 105 - 110lbs, and I ordered a size small if that helps. I know people my size always have trouble with things fitting properly! If you weigh more than 110lbs you should be fine too, as the material is stretchy."
5.0,These ears and tail are great! I love how the ears clip in and there is no uncomfortable headband. The tail was very popular at the Halloween party and I loved how it moved when I danced
5.0,Bought these for my coworkers wedding. The bridal party looked great.
5.0,Great quality product and price. Use for emergency information.
5.0,"Excellent product!! I use them with my summer clogs to keep my toes warm and that part of my foot very dry!! I must share, VERO, the company that has this item, goes Above and Beyond with their customer service!!! Very sad that you do not see this much anymore.  When I ordered the larger size, knowing I should get my regular size, and saw I could not return via Amzon, I emailed the company and on the same day I received a response and instructions to get this resolved. And may I add, numerous emails with updates!!! Now this is how all businesses should operate! Thank you Elizabeth,  MP üòÉ"
5.0,"This bag was just as expected,  awesome! In looks and quality. I am pretty rough on purses and one of the buckles on the front pockets finally came off but I would definitely recommend this to anyone."

5.0,"I love this ankle bracelet! Perfect for belly dancing, which is what i used it for. But I cannot wait to wear it during the summer on the beach!"

5.0,"I got these as a gift (off my wishlist) and I wear them with everything. Shorts? Yup. Dresses? Yup. Skirts? Yup. Pants that have holes in them? You betcha. I adore these leggings. They are durable and machine washable, but I find that they twist up too much in the wash, so I hand wash them. Sometimes detangling them isn't worth the fight."
5.0,Looks even prettier in person. Looks well made and so cute for summer. Love this necklace.üíïüíïüíïüíï
5.0,"Very pleased with purchase, better than oragami!"

5.0,"My middle school daughter is required to wear a mask all day at school, and she loves the smaller fit and comfort of these masks so much that we ordered a second set. Thank you!"
5.0,There‚Äôs not a lot of option for a vertical helix but there‚Äôs this one! I love it. I put it on with tweezer and rubber band and it work.  I wish this was available in gold.
5.0,"My granddaughter is in band, she loves the necklace!"
5.0,"looks like a 100 dollar watch and it looks like it, I was very rough on it and treated it terribly but for the most part, it held up. I dropped it all the time, and once off a balcony and it took 6 months to brake after droping it on cement, greate buy would recamend for the price."
5.0,Very nice material and got so many polite comments. 5'6&#34; 150 pds and the medium fit me perfect. Looks like a dress that would cost a lot more. I have not washed this but it looks like something I would only hand wash in the tub. Very breathable fabric on a hot day in NYC was really impressed and felt confident wearing it. Very classy and sexy!!
5.0,I got this to replace a hat I got when I was in Ireland. This one is Perfect!
5.0,So comfortable and light.  I love it
5.0,There quite a lot for the price and the croc charms themselves are good quality and cool.

5.0,Love this top so much! I only wish it came in more colors!
5.0,"Came in perfect condition, not damaged. They look good, the black powder coat is coming off the post, but that's expected. The black powder coat is staying on the actually front piece just fine, and it looks awesome :)"
5.0,"Estoy muy contento con la compra, es un reloj de muy Buena calidad y a muy buen precio"
5.0,Son loves it - he wanted the retro Casio for a long time and says this one is perfect !
5.0,My Grandson loves his sunglasses and actually wears them all the time
5.0,Love them.  Just what I was looking for.  I wanted a black small/post size earring.
5.0,Nice wax kit.
5.0,Love it! I've never spent this much on a purse but it is so worth it. I can fit so many different things in it so now I'm not having so many different things in my hand on my way to the car. I will say the brown isn't exactly what I expected it to look like but it is still cute.
5.0,"Good size and quality, very pretty!"
5.0,Stylish and different.  Can dress up an outfit or make you look nice even if your wearing jeans

5.0,Nicely made Fits perfect true to size
5.0,This was just the right size and was well received as a gift.
5.0,This fit my husband perfectly and is warm and absorbent!
5.0,"Impressive men's ring -- but the ladies like it too! This ring is really fun to wear, but without the added fear of loss or theft. It's somewhat bold and heavy, and it looks amazingly real. Like real diamonds and 14kt white gold. Actually, I hear that wearing stainless steal on the skin is one of the more healthy metals to wear for body chemistry. I'm wearing mine on my middle (Saturn) finger, and it fits slightly more tight than other rings that have a narrowing of the band in the back. Perfect for men, too."
5.0,"You can‚Äôt beat it for the price! Cute and lightweight and goes well with high waisted leggings. I bought it in gray, black, and white. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and got a medium in the black and white, and small in gray. Both sizes fit fine.<br /><br />It does get super wrinkly though, so be sure to hang it up.<br /><br />It‚Äôs also a smooth cotton material, super soft but not sweat wicking at all. It holds on to moisture when you‚Äôre working out, and the gray and white tops show sweat marks really clearly."
5.0,Followed the sizing instructions and it fit perfectly. My little one loves it. The cap is great for keeping long hair out of their faces while they swim. Very cute and not problems with colors bleeding/transferring.
5.0,"I'm 135lbs 5'3 normally a medium in most things, bought a small in this and it fits perfectly. The skirt is super good quality and really soft! Love it."
5.0,Very flattering swimsuit! Very happy with the purchase!!!

5.0,Beautiful color and print. Cute summer dress!
5.0,"I like everything about these jammies! Smooth on the skin, comfy comfy, wash up nice. Might purchase another color."
5.0,Husband loves it. Gets compliments daily.
5.0,Fits as expected I order up a size to get a more loose look.  Super soft material.  Happy with my purchase.  Nice quality.
5.0,Adjustable ear straps ‚úÖ protective yet comfy‚úÖ Not too thin‚úÖ Doesn‚Äôt slide a whole lot love it!
5.0,"Wow, wore on my trip to Montero Bay"
5.0,I love sloths and I love this super comfy tank top!
5.0,"Purchased as a Christmas gift, but I may keep it for myself.  Large & sturdy quality tote that is made very well."
5.0,Whenever I wear these gloves everyone asks me where I got them and if they work; they are GREAT!
5.0,Nice tops.
5.0,My daughter loves it she loves anything that his kingdom hearts and it fits her perfectly
5.0,Loved these earrings. I wanted something with a nautical theme and these are perfect

5.0,"Nice and light, perfect for my Nikon mirrorless camera"
5.0,Best visor ever. Adjust to your head and stays on in the wind!
5.0,Fits great & so cute!
5.0,"A little on the bigger side, but beautiful"
5.0,"The Grid-it is fantastically customizable, and I use this one to organize my oboe supplies.  It holds my folding stand, tuner, reed case, soaking container, pencil, mandrel, reed knife, spool of thread, cutting block, ruler, and pipe cleaners very nicely.  It also looks great and fits into my messenger bag.<br /><br />There is a pocket in the back, which is only good for relatively-flat things (like plaques, dollar bills, and coins), which cannot easily be accommodated by the front part that has the stretchy straps."
5.0,I have two pair of these and bought a pair for my daughter. All together I own 8 pair of Taos shoes I love the style and quality of the shoes and the comfort and support is fantastic.
5.0,Ecelente material
5.0,Great look and even better price
5.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved it.  Good quality too.
5.0,My granddaughter was so surprised! She absolutely loved it and hasn't taken it off since it arrived!
5.0,"Bought this for my son. He loves beanies and it looked cool and different. It fit great and he loves it! Now all his friends want one. The goggles function like sun glasses, making a sunny winter morning in Western Pennsylvania better."
5.0,"Can't say enough great things about this suit. So cute and flattering. I just love it and everyone else does too.  Very comfortable, and DID I SAY FLATTERING!"
5.0,"I bought these leggings in the grey marl and light blue marl colors. I am usually a large in leggings, and the larges fit as expected. I am 5'9"" and they also reach full length on me, so if you are on the shorter side be aware you may have to roll or scrunch them. They are super stretchy, so if you are between sizes I would suggest sizing down. I don't own the Gymshark vital seamless leggings, but I own other Gymshark products and these feel of similar quality. The stitching is all high quality with no loose threads or bumpy/warped seams. The fabric is a more slick/performance material, but they are still quite soft and not too thin, scratchy, or shiny. They are also squatproof! Even the light blue color, which I thought may have issues, was totally opaque. The flexibility, comfort, and opacity of these make them great for leg days. I have been working out in my garage since the gyms have been closed and while these are long, I don't find they are too heavy or hot for the days where it's 100+ degrees Fahrenheit. Seriously, if you are wanting Gymshark-style leggings but don't want to shell out $50, give these a try. I've owned a lot of different Amazon leggings and these are by far my favorite so far!"
5.0,I like the polarized lense on these glasses better than any other low end polarized glasses.  I also find them very comfortable.  For the money they were a great buy.
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE ... get comments every time I wear them
5.0,Love this chain perfect length
5.0,"Well made Elvis boxer underwear. I actually purchased this for me to wear as summer pj, with a t-shirt top. Underwear is comfortable"
5.0,"Can't say enough good things about this hat! It's comfortable, warm, water-resistant, soft and (I think) stylish. Great value for the $$"
5.0,"This set is very soft and comfortable. It‚Äôs made very well and isn‚Äôt super thin. It did not shrink when i washed it and it held its shape. The pants were a little long, but I‚Äôm accustomed to this because I‚Äôm short."
5.0,"Comfy, supportive and gives me some push up. Ordered medium and it fits perfectly! The padding is not too much and no wires it a plus. This is a bra that I don't have to worrying about taking off to relax at the end of the day. I love the colors and would definitely order again. I'm throwing my old, padded, wire poking bra away today!"
5.0,I bought these for my granddaughter. True to size and so soft!
5.0,"This shirt fits true to size for me.  It has a long length and is worn tied, so I can adjust the tightness at the bottom. I  love the rich red color. I have worn and washed it twice in cold water and have not noticed any bleeding. The fabric is soft and comfortable when it is hot out. Overall, flattering for me since I am not too happy with my stomach area. There are a few ways I can tie it to adjust the fit, which adds some options.  You do have to knot it twice to keep it from slipping, since the fabric is so smooth.  I think this is a nice top for summertime, good value, and overall I am happy with it!"
5.0,the best Ray-ban.
5.0,Very comfortable.  A little big but good for overall.  Love the pockets.
5.0,I am always a little cautious when buying things on line but this dress is absolutely perfect! The pockets make it even better and have received a lot of compliments on this dress. The cute it very flattering as well.
5.0,This seems to run a little large at the top. But I am pear shaped. Smaller on top than I am at the bottom.  I think I could have went 1 and a half size down. But other than that it is very pretty and I love the color. I might just take it in a little with some needle and thread in the bust area. I will shop here again and just order 1 size down.
5.0,"This is hands down the absolute warmest jacket I have ever worn.  Even the hoody is filled with down.  I have owned multiple $300 jackets in my life, and none compare to the comfort and warmth of this jacket.  The only thing this jacket is lacking is being 100% waterproof like Gortex jackets.  But that's it.  This jacket is as close to perfect as it gets!  Trust me, stop reading reviews and just buy it.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
5.0,Warm and fun designs! I didn't think they would be so nice at that low price!
5.0,"I ORDERED ONE IN BLACK.<br />SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE.<br />TOOK FOR EVER TO COME BY SLOW BOAT FROM CHINA.<br />ORDERED RED FOR MY DARLING DOCTOR'S ASSISTANTS.<br />STATED - ""IN STOCK""<br />ORDERED 26 JULY 2020<br />DUE - 21 SEPT-31 OCT 2020 - IF ANYTHING LIKE BLACK I ORDERED - MAYBE 31 OCT 2020.<br />AGAIN - SLOW BOAT FROM CHINA"
5.0,"These women's earnings are so pretty. The jem in the middle is a dark blue, just the same as a September birthstone. The other ones are clear crystal. The back is silver with a clip to hold the earning in place. I have worn them a couple times and they fit very well. They are not heavy and do not make ears green or anything. I think these would make a great birthday present or mothers day gift. The square piece seems to be made out of metal, and the hooks are a thinner metal. These would go great with a evening gown or even prom dress. These women earnings are very elegant. If there is anyone in your family that has a September birthday i would jump all over this since these do have the birthstone in the middle. with prompt shipping and fine packaging, this order exceeded my expectations. The quality of the product seems superior to loose stones i found at gem shows and over the internet. The blue gem are vibrant, dark-blue, well-matched and free of visible flaws. The stones i found are before these, less well-matched, and obviously flawed. Also, i would have to pay for the setting and labor to have the stones i found mounted. So the quality of this order is superior to any jewels i could find or make for myself. i also bought a small ring with equally beautiful matched vibrant blue gem."
5.0,"This bag was way better than I expected, especially for the price. The leather handle wrap makes it much more comfortable to carry if you have a lot of weight in the bag. Well constructed and looks nice. Very sturdy and roomy. I was very hesitant about this bag after reading some of the reviews, now my only regret is that I didn't find it sooner. I will be purchasing at least one more possibly two."
5.0,I don't usually wear flowers but this is a very nice top. I can wear this with pants or skirt.
5.0,Very tight for my smaller wrists and I even ordered the large and it still was leaving marks. Not true to size at all.
5.0,It's great and well made!!!
5.0,I don‚Äôt usually like ‚Äúsilky‚Äù sweats but these are so soft and comfortable and fit PERFECTLY. Very flattering. You won‚Äôt regret this purchase.
5.0,I bought this for my Halloween costume going as a sexy fairy godmother and I fell in love with this cape as soon as I saw it! It‚Äôs so cute and I love the blue and the added sparkle to it. Definitely helped complete my look.
5.0,"Well made, well priced, solid and comfortable for shoulder toting.  As a brittle diabetic, i always carry blood test kit, glucose supplements, then,too, my wallet, kindle, notepad, pens.  This has room to spare.  Pocketswell made.  Zippers well made.  The charcoal color is quite attractiveagainst the leather straps.  Have already received compliments.  Hh"
5.0,I love these hats. I now have a few and even got my friend one because she liked mine.
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this wallet!<br />Designed perfectly to fit everything I want in it!<br />I‚Äôve had mine almost a year and it still looks new! I have gotten lots of comliments on it, my mom liked mine so much I had to buy her the brown one! Great quality at a reasonable price!"
5.0,"Made well,fits great,Ive bought one in almost every color,love these shorts."
5.0,Got this dress for my daughter and she loved it.

5.0,These are perfect at the beach
5.0,Hat made very nice & the Ohio symbol is perfect on it I love it
5.0,"Fit well, look great and delivered on time! Thanks"
5.0,"I just love this anklet, it is not too gaudy, does not look cheap and can be worn with any outfit.  The elastic seems like it will hold and not stretch out of place (with time we will see).  I think it will stand the test of time.  Love IT"
5.0,Great fit arrive sooner than I thought it would
5.0,"In the image I have 11 cards total, and it fits well!! I haven't tried with only 4 cards, but with all the different rewards credit cards I have, I can't just possibly bring 4. I thought they'd slip easily but no! I would possibly attach a tile on this on the future because it can be misplaced (I haven't yet but I can see how it can be due to its size). Picking the card you need is easy too! Just slide all the cards up and pinch the bottom!"
5.0,These glasses are really helpful against headlight glare at night. They are oversized so they can fit over Rx glasses if needed or fit well by themselves. Nice! Thank you!
5.0,I forgot ordering this but after checking remembered I ordered it for our granddaughter.  She loved it.
5.0,I love this shirt & it's style. Fit like a glove compared to other shirts I've ordered on Amazon. Satisfied.
5.0,super soft and comfy! the drawstring says ‚ÄúKE SPORTS‚Äù which made me chuckle.

5.0,WOW ! So good. These are awesome well worth it I will be buying more the app black ones I bought are very comfy and polarized . They are as good as 100$ glasses to me. Highly recommended
5.0,"It says men's but it feels and looks feminine, gave it to mom as a gift."
5.0,Very nice....it is black and not green as shown in the listing but that is what I wanted and that is what is stated on the listing....I like the combination and could not find it in Maui while I was there....(I didn't spend that much time in gift shops) Good price on line..made in same place (Philippines I think) No stinky odors...Mahala
5.0,Smaller than I thought but very cute. My daughter loves them.
5.0,"They are what they are. Fun and on the big side, light weight. Kept most of they for myself give the other away and they love them."
5.0,"If you're a runner and need something to keep you warm in the winter, these are for you. They do fit snugly but very comfortably. Get these, they work down to about 0 F."
5.0,"Ordered a small for my daughter who is 4'11"" and it fits perfect. Even has a little stretch to it"

5.0,Comfy cozy & cute. Matches well with pink & white outfit
5.0,This is such a cute necklace. The chain is just the right length for me. The colors are so pretty. I wish I could have found earrings to match.
5.0,"My hands get very cold because I have poor circulation. Anyway, I wanted soft mittens I could wear to bed, I had a hard time finding soft mittens for adults, all I could find in local stores were gloves, but I specifically wanted mittens to pool the heat. Boo hoo, blah blah blah anyway, there are perfect. Very soft inside, warm, good size. My hands are on the small size, these fit well.."
5.0,"Love these...so cute, fits great, very comfy to sleep in. I bought one and loved it so much I got another one."
5.0,I am now wearing my dime necklace. I wish I could have closed the bezel completely there was a little space there

5.0,"Just like I remember as a kid, and just as cool"
5.0,Perfect fitting. I use this since I am a nurse. It puts less stress on my ears. It also looks good. I hope the colors don‚Äôt fade!

5.0,"Most comfortable and easy to adjust cold weather mask ever!  Only downside is that it's not water resistant, but I have a hooded waterproof hiking jacket, and the hood easily fits over this.  No more canvas or stretch-knit for this guy.  Great for prescription glass wearers like myself."
5.0,Used for recital. Fit perfectly.

5.0,Socks were comfy and colorful. I got tons of complements.
5.0,"Love them, no negatives!!!"
5.0,"These are the only bars I have found that will do a reasonable job of keeping my Garmin Vivomove on.<br /><br />The Garmin has large holes for the lug, and the marathon bars have 0.90mm thick lugs, while most are only 0.90.<br /><br />I have not measured, but it seems like the Marathon bars may be longer when uncompressed.  Every other 20mm spring bar I have tried will pop out easily when the band is pulled at a diagonal.  This easily leads to fishing the watch out of an engine.<br /><br />I've had a few of the marathon bars pop out while working, but they aren't coming out easily."
5.0,"The built-in light could be better.  The description said the watch is waterproof, the instruction manual that came with it said that it is not waterproof, so which is it? Anyway, the watch does what I want it to do, which is keep the correct time and show me the day and date at a glance. That's all I need."
5.0,"Flattering to any body type, this is such a breezy and pretty dress.  Comfortable to wear anytime. Yellow color is a little more orange than true yellow, but pretty none the less. Great value for the money."
5.0,"These are great! I'm a size 18/20, 46DD and they fit really well. I was worried that the little cut out in the back between the band and and racerback would cause a knob of bulge in the middle of my back but there's no bunching or bulging anywhere, not even under my arms or around my band. The colors are really bright and cute and make me less self-conscious about them being seen under tanks with large cut outs under the arms. They've really comfortable and the memory foam cups can be removed easily."
5.0,Such a fun image for a shirt.
5.0,My daughter loves loves this set it‚Äôs very pretty and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap also cute earrings come with
5.0,"Very handsome piece of ""jewelery""."
5.0,"I normally wear a extra small in everything, and this dress fit perfectly. The middle section of the dress has some type of elastic to it but I wore a long jacket over the dress so it wasn‚Äôt noticeable or annoying or tacky to me (like some of the other comments) It was super cute and not super thick but not sheer either. Definitely a cute dress for fall time or a nice 65-70 degree day."
5.0,"my 5 year old daughter uses it for kindergarten and she loves it. she has the pink, grey & green hearts.<br />the pencil case loop tore off almost immediately, but she doesn‚Äôt use that for kindergarten so it wasn‚Äôt a huge deal."
5.0,It is exactly as described. Definitely buy it again.
5.0,"This ring is adorable, and true to size. I love it!"
5.0,This is just the cutest dress. It does run small. I‚Äôm normally a 6-8 in dresses and got the large/xl and it fit .
5.0,"This is our second pair of polarspex eye glasses. My daughter had some issues with her eyes, and we were told by doctor to always wear sun glasses when outside. Better to have polorized ones. They are well made, we used another one for about a year, and still use it without any harm. I can not say how good they do their job as I am not wearing it. But seems like my daughter is absolutely fine while playing under the the sun. She is 5 years old now, and even when emshe was 4 glasses fit her face perfect."
5.0,Like the style. Very cute. Just not crazy about the material.
5.0,Daughter loved it! A little bigger than expected but super soft.
5.0,Surprise!! I am using it as a face mask.
5.0,"The ukulele is new to me and I have arthritis. I bought this beautiful strap to help make holding the uke while I play much easier.  It definitely does that while also being very pretty.  Plus the pics that came with it were a lovely surprise.  I am still a novice, but I am catching on since I played the guitar previously.  Thank you for such a high quality product."
5.0,This picture is a sweet-faced as my own Cavvy. I take here everywhere with me.
5.0,These boots are very comfortable. Not too heavy and suitable for outdoor work.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ef4bced8584b5998870f58a1c2f9079c]] These pants fit soo well, I love them so much. I ALMOST GOT SCAMMED to buy these from a website on advertising on IG. They wanted me to by them for 100 dollars but give me 50% off as a ‚Äúbrand ambassador‚Äù, I got them up here for 25 dollars."
5.0,"Comfortable and I like the style, easy to slip on yet stay on your feet easily. The more I wear them the more I enjoy them!  As a Chiropractor, it's difficult any sandal with reasonable arch support. Flip flops are terrible and I see people all the time just destroying their feet in one of the ten colors they have. Get a solid pair of sandals and enjoy them for years, my last pair of birks lasted almost a decade."
5.0,Like the feminine design and classic Polk a dot.
5.0,"Very nice and very shiny chain.  It's a bit costly, but this size is hard to find and the quality seems especially nice.  I bought the 30&#34; but now I see it's not available.  Too bad."
5.0,Have tried it and it works as advertised.
5.0,I received a lot of compliments while wearing this dress!
5.0,Bigger than expected. I love the inside too. Cards everywhere. It's awesome. A little to pricey for me. It's pretty durable. The outside zipper does get caught up on the inside zipper.
5.0,Really like this item.
5.0,Love this dress. It is lightweight and comfortable. The dress hangs straight and loose. When you add the belt it is very versatile. You can have the bodice form fitting or blouse it over the belt. Very easy to dress up with a regular white leather belt or a little jewelry.  A really great buy. Would love to order in more colors.
5.0,"These are beautiful pajamas.  After reading the reviews I ordered a size up an extra large I should‚Äôve stayed true to size and ordered a large I will keep the extra large and next time or a large. They are good quality material feel very good next to my skin,  And because I am large chested to pull over top is wonderful no buttons to gap. The sleeves and gloves are plenty long enough and contrary to what people say the waist  is very ample. The seller was right on"
5.0,Don't know how it fit. Was gift
5.0,"Great style and fit--have bought two of these dresses so far, and hope to buy more.  Great summer attire--wash and hang dry quickly.  My husband really gave me a big smile on first seeing both dresses--recommend highly."
5.0,"Really nice piece, and so reasonably priced. We now have a few of these, and each is better than the last. Don't know how durable they are, but as they are glass they get special care. My wife will probably have many of them before long, as she likes them so much."
5.0,I love that it fit so well but I don‚Äôt like how very thin it is.
5.0,Bought as a gift. Nice scarf
5.0,I have a new Beiber fan and she was so overjoyed to open these on Christmas they are great quality fit just right
5.0,True to size my man LOVES it!
5.0,"Very comfortable and supportive bra. RARE FIND in my position. It is very challenging for larger chested women to find a comfortable, high quality bra. Even at a store in person it‚Äôs nearly impossible. I took the plunge and gave this a shot. Normally I get a 38 DD, but I bought it extra large at 40 DD. I like options with adjustability. It‚Äôs perfection. Nothing pops out, everything stays in place and nothing is digging. I just ordered more. So happy I found this one!!!"
5.0,"I love this set. It is so soft and comfortable to wear around the house, but I love it for the movie theater because it‚Äôs always cold in there. I have also worn it to the grocery store, I love it."
5.0,"I love the longer length of these earrings.  Will be perfect for any party, but especially for daughter's dinner party!"
5.0,Love this dress - it‚Äôs super cute on! I ordered another in a different color!
5.0,"Excellent gift item, the pearls are not round, more of a flattened pearl but that doesn't detract from how they look.  Well worth it."
5.0,The product had good quality for the price.
5.0,"I got a small and it fit perfect. Am 5' 6&#34;, 124 lbs, D-cup.  It has some soft sponginess to it, but still thin and tight enough to wear under clothes.  I really like the material.  It will not stop wind at all, so be aware.  But very breathable.  The bottoms were perfect. Not too short.  Didn't cut into midsection. Very comfy.  The top could have had longer sleeves and a bit longer torso length, but it will work.<br /> All in all I am happy with the quality and comfort."
5.0,Love love love .... is the only way to describe this bag !
5.0,Looks great!! Material is soft - and HUBBY LOVES IT!!
5.0,I love this set.  It is very nice and lightweight.  I wore it to a class reunion affair and received lots of compliments. My mom even asked me to order her one.
5.0,Loved the dress and fit perfect!
5.0,I ordered two sizes larger based on the size chart and other reviews and I probably could have ordered only one size up. It does take a while to arrive but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. It's a nice fabric - not paper thin but not quite sweatshirt material. The cut is flattering even when it fits a little baggy. My only gripe (and it's a small one) is that there's no tag but if you hold it up you can tell which side goes the back
5.0,"This tu-tu is super adorable. Its soft and fits my baby girl well. I was a bit worried about it being tight or extremely short because she's on the chunky side at 36lbs and usually wear sizes 3T/4t. But this fits great and it washes even better. She had cake and juice all over it after the party, thought it would stain but it was good as new in seconds after hand washing. I would definitely recommend. However you may need leggings if your child is on the chunky side like mine."
5.0,Great price for this necklace. Dressy enough to wear with business casual clothing and does not look super fake.
5.0,"Love these, they look good on. Put around the ankle of a plain boot, very bohemian chic!!"
5.0,Exactly what I needed and it was a great purchase.
5.0,"Love them, cute anklet socks."
5.0,Love the shoe
5.0,it fit my wife üëç
5.0,I love the face on this watch. It's clear and highly visible.
5.0,"My only complaint I didn't discover these before being limited in options. I really, really want more of these."
5.0,Very nice. Comfortable.
5.0,Comfort and the feel
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter who teaches kindergarten, (she has an owl theme in her classroom) and we both agreed that they are fun and exceptionally well made. She wears them most days and gets lots of compliments. I highly recommend them."
5.0,This was a gift for my little cousin and she loved them! She was even more excited when I told her how much they were and that there were a lot of other options.
5.0,Another pretty dress for summer at the office.
5.0,It's a beautiful dress. I just need to lose weight to look better in it lol
5.0,"Great stylish selection of gauges, they fit perfectly. I‚Äôm looking forward to changing up my gauges more often than before."
5.0,Delivery  is amazing.
5.0,"It was a little larger than I thought, but overall I like it. It seems to be well made."
5.0,This is the second dress I have ordered. I ordered the navy first to wear for my daughters birthday party and loved it so much I came back for the maroon. I am so self conscious but this dress makes me feel beautiful.
5.0,Awesome looking sneaker.  My 9 year old son really loves them!
5.0,I love these perfect for homemade jewelry a lot higher quality then i was expecting !
5.0,got the product as advertise and still works after 6 months
5.0,I like it very much because of multiple pockets. The location of the pockets make sense. They are functional.
5.0,I've been looking for ear socks for my Oakley X-Frame Ducati prescription sunglasses so that I wouldn't have to replace the frames themselves. I was relieved to find the Walleva accessories.
5.0,I got this for my grandson for Christmas and it is adorable on him.
5.0,My size
5.0,"This is my third pair - my first pair I stepped on in Mexico, my second pair got knocked off my head on a sailboat, and I'm hoping third time is a charm with this pair.  I love everything about these glasses and if something happens to this pair, I will gladly buy a fourth pair!"
5.0,"This is absolutely beautiful! Large enough to make a statement.  A+ for first impression.  The amethyst color stone is so pretty against my real dress, and the chain is gunmetal, so pretty love love love."
5.0,This is the absolutely most wonderful robe that I have ever had. And I have had a cashmere one!
5.0,"Love the hat, fits well.  Great deal.."
5.0,Its very lightweight and love it.

5.0,"Love the dress great fit.<br />I'm 5'4, 120lbs, order small."

5.0,"just as in picture, beautiful bag. I use it as pool bag. wish it had water proof liner."
5.0,This men's cross body is a great buy.
5.0,"This dress is so cute and the fabric is soft. It's not as structured as some other 1950s dresses so it fits on me perfectly. The bow is a little bit floppy though, it's made out of a more stretchy fabric."
5.0,Love it! All I can say is you won't be disappointed üôÇ
5.0,"So pretty, and well made! Hat and arm warmers look like the photos, true to color. They feel soft with comfortable stretch. Hat fits my larger noggin nicely. Really nice quality!"
5.0,"my husband loved it, now he wears it when he wants to hide....lol"
5.0,"I like everything about this Pj... material, color, and especially the way it fits"
5.0,Works as advertised!
5.0,I used this on my cats Christmas stocking and love it so much!
5.0,Wow  amazing
5.0,"Love the blouses and ordered three. Light material with a comfortable fit, look attractive."
5.0,"I have several cowboy hats but I purchased this one strictly for work. I've had it for almost a year now and has been through all kinds of abuse. Still holding up very fell. I have yet to cut off any fraying fibers or strands because there haven't been any. One thing to note though is that since the inside isn't lined, if the hat is worn frequently and is moist with sweat for long periods of time, the inside will develop mold. Doesn't do any harm, it's just there. A day of leaving it upside down in the hot sun dries it all up. Otherwise this hat is real trustworthy and made tough enough for real world use."
5.0,"I've ordered a number of different bands for my Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle. So far (I've only had it a week) this is my favorite! Got the blue one. It's stylish, lightweight, and good quality. I'll update this review if something goes awry, but I like it enough to order the brown and red varieties."
5.0,My husband loves the cap.  Reminds him of his Navy days of 50 years ago.  This is the carrier he was on.  Well made cap.
5.0,My favorite socks. Stay put and dont roll down
5.0,Great look and appears true to size. Nice material as well.  Beliece I bought a large or XL.
5.0,It is so comfortable and perfect for cool summer nights.  I don't know how to do pictures.
5.0,Love it! Will be buying for friends and family for holidays and birthdays!
5.0,"It came 2 days early. It's light weight with a big ring. Very elite to design. The logo colors and the whole look is exact same as the scual product. Great price for a great item. This 49ers key chain is made out of  chrom medal not plastic . I a, extreamly pleased with my item  and purchase. Great gift for any football 49rers fan for any occasion."
5.0,My grandson look so cute in this coat he is 2years old coat fit really nice the only compliant I have is the sleeveless are a little too long so I tuck them under but other then that I love this coat for him as a gift
5.0,My new favorite sweatshirt!
5.0,Very dainty and fun.  I like it alot.  Hopefully it doesn't change colors.
5.0,Well made! Perfect for storing cleaners!
5.0,"I like the color blocked design on this Cashmerelina brand cardigan. I wear a lot of black on the bottom but black can be a little too harsh near my face so black on the bottom with white on top seems an ideal color combo.<br /><br />Normally I wear a small or medium on top and the medium sleeves were roomy enough to accommodate a shirt underneath. The open cardigan has no buttons down the front but to my surprise, on each side near the hips there are three well sewn hidden snaps. This design allows you the choice of opening a side split (or not) up to three snaps or seven and a half inches deep.<br /><br />I placed my Amazon order on August 1 and the jiffy bag post marked from China was delivered to Southern CA on August 12th.<br /><br />The sewn in tag states:<br />&#34;100% Cashmere&#34;<br />&#34;Dry Clean only&#34;<br /><br />I have never purchased anything from Cashmerelina before but will consider them again."
5.0,"True to size! Soft and great short pajamas. I love it! I normally wear a M but I decided this time for a S, I don't regret! I will order a new one"
5.0,Bought these handkerchiefs as gifts for faculty I'm visiting in Africa. Each one has a slightly different floral design. Quality fabric and beautiful.

5.0,Extremely impressed with these earrings. Beautiful!
5.0,I was surprisingly pleased with the material durability and comfort!
5.0,Fits perfectly and very comfortable.  Fairly lightweight and a little stretchy.  Arrived amazingly fast.
5.0,the comforter was great great grandson loved the softness and it streach to the comfort of his head
5.0,Great sneaker
5.0,"Good quality, nice shine, comfortable to wear"
5.0,"I kind of wish this was a bodysuit but the top fit nicely. Soft material, sleeves were a little loose but overall no complaints!"
5.0,My favorite clothing item I‚Äôve purchased on amazon. They are stretchy yet fitting. Will be buying more. And it‚Äôs a lil cropped.
5.0,Love the necklace!!
5.0,"My daughter was looking for some cool clothes.  The Scarlett Darkness line has been bringing out some really fun clothing.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />Although this would be superior in cotton spandex, this is okay in poly.  It is not picky to wear and is comfortable as it can be for being polyester which tends to be hot.<br /><br />STYLE<br />The style is really cool looking.  Once the ties get situated, securing them is important, especially if you want to shorten the ribbons.  The back has a point which looks kind of cool too.  It is a bit short, but a bright shirt underneath really sets off the features and it is nice.<br /><br />HANDS<br />My daughter is bugged by the tied ribbons on the middle finger.  She is thinking of replacing them with a stretch cord or a cord instead.  The ribbons get in the way.<br /><br />FIT<br />My daughter wears a size 14=16 misses US and this in XL fits her perfectly.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />The style of this hoodie is great.  My daughter loves it, but a few small modifications will be made to make wearing it more practical.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is cool.  It looks great and is fun to wear."
5.0,"Love, Love, Love, these are my new go-to earrings. Perfect size, color, and shine. For the price you can't beat these earrings. Also own them in rose gold. You can't go wrong with either color."
5.0,"Bought for my toddlers baby shark bday party. Super cute, fit well, comfy and priced reasonably."
5.0,My daughter love‚Äôs it.
5.0,"so pretty, received lots of compliments"

5.0,Beautiful.  I would definitely buy again.
5.0,it was a good gift
5.0,"Love this dress. Great quality, got lots of compliments from my step son's wedding. I'm 5'2"" and it was tricky to hem because of the stitched design on the front of the dress, but mom hemmed it for me and it turned out beautiful."
5.0,Well made and very comfortable and helps with swelling.
5.0,Perfect! Exactly as advertised. Very happy with purchase.
5.0,"I had no idea it was for ashes, but it is a nice gift otherwise!"

5.0,"Exactly what my husband was looking for, perfect fit-not too tight on the waist like some others. Bought one pair initially and have bought 2 more since. Just bought the longer leggings for winter for him, hopefully he will love them just as much!"
5.0,"Fits my watch, and it does not make my 4500. Breitling watch look cheap! Many trips to watch repair shops and jewelers could not gain any band 24MM. I wanted a mesh band and had been told it was an old fashioned style that no one uses or makes anymore and that the size would be impossible to get anymore. I am grateful to have found exactly what I needed from this seller!"
5.0,Outstanding outer layer for rain and winter running. I ordered a size larger and this fits perfect over my rain and winter running gear. Great solution for early morning runs when you need heavy gear for colder temperatures.
5.0,"No liner, which is ok with me. Very cool and light weight here in the Phoenix heat. Quick drying. Durable and fit is exact."
5.0,Love this but it was too small for my daughter
5.0,Purchased these to wear a bra with a low-back dress and it worked really well.
5.0,They are so cute!!!

5.0,This dress looks amazing on me. I am extremely happy with this purchase.
5.0,"LOVE THIS!!! I get so many compliments!! My only withdraw is that it is on the heavier side, so I can't wait to take it off when I get home from work."
5.0,"These socks are just as great as they look. Warm, comfortable, and very, very cute! I did not put mine in the dryer, though they did fine in the washing machine. Would definitely buy more colors if I had the money to spend on socks!"
5.0,"This is a great tool.  It holds the watchband securely while you add or remove links.  All metal so it is well made. Had plastic one with one hold down, it couldn't hold a candle to this watch band holder."
5.0,Was skeptical about the material but was actually nice to wear in the hot and humid area of New Orleans. Would buy again.
5.0,LOVE IT!! I am 5.6‚Äù Approx 180 pounds post partum in this pic. I loveeed it.

5.0,"My daughter loves this so much it's a fight to get it off. In fact, I just let her sleep in it last night because I didn't want to battle and its warm an cozy. I like the one snap at the top that holds it on her better."
5.0,I LOVE this swim suit!!!  So flattering!!!  It is my go to
5.0,Always happy with the LIGE brand
5.0,Good :)
5.0,I‚Äôve bought 2 pair. Fabric is the perfect weight. These can be worn to the gym or dressed up with boots !  Will definitely be buying more .

5.0,The dress is made of a very nice high quality material. I was definitely pleasantly surprised. It is comfortable and flattering. Super soft!
5.0,Love this watch.  Like the size since I have big wrists.  Reminds me of the 80s.  Wear it everywhere.
5.0,The key-chain was very nice and just what I expected
5.0,"I use it everyday and for travel. No metal makes it TSA friendly, and the black is subtle. I love being able to adjust the length precisely, and the excess lenght neatly tucks underneath the belt."
5.0,"My husband loves these! The jeans have just a little stretch to them, and form to your body as you wear them. He is very picky and said these are his favorite jeans and now wants some in every color!"
5.0,"At first, I wasn't sure about these pants.  The fabric is a bit shiny, so they looked more athletic than a true jogger.  However, I've worn them for two weeks and have really fallen in love with them.  I work in a fairly casual environment and I can easily dress them up or down.  They really are the perfect mix of stretchy leggings and joggers!"
5.0,"I love this dress, i get great compliment and it is so comfortable"
5.0,"The first day I wore them I got so many compliments, they have almost no weight and I forgot they were even there"

5.0,"I can wear this as a dress, cover up,  and a nightgown.  Soft fabric"

5.0,LOVE THEM!!!! Get plenty of compliments wearing them!
5.0,Looks very good feels great not heavy at all . The smell was a bit off  ..like a fishy sent but after I wash it . It's prefect
5.0,It's a good mask for social distancing or just just biking and fishing. Very lightweight..snug fit for normal male heads but is adjustable for smaller head sizes like woman..
5.0,Very sturdy and expensive looking! I‚Äôm using it to replace the leather strap on my $800 briefcase and it looks great!
5.0,"Great quality, graphics are clear, but I have a tiny wrist and it‚Äôs a gender neutral band that has to be large enough for all wrist sizes so it wraps kind of weird. Overall it‚Äôs super cute."
5.0,Had to do a little adjustment but it was good
5.0,Beautiful garment. It was perfect for my son's Key West wedding in December.
5.0,cute and easy to adjust
5.0,"The insoles in my shoes had become compressed with time, and I was starting to feel like I was going to fall off my shoes.  I figured these new insoles might help, and were worth a try.  They instantly make my feet feel more stable, and seem to be the perfect fit for what I needed.  HOORAY!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:4bbea995af87e86c3a1a141c09f27a0d]] SOOO easy and fun!! Tons of holiday laughs and cheer!

5.0,My daughter loved her Halloween outfit.
5.0,I love this peice. It was exactly what I wanted
5.0,"I'm 5'8' 130 lbs. Usially a size 8-10. This top totally works for me, but if you're muh bigger, I wouldn't recommend it. That said. I'm very happy with it. The fabric and finish is like a light weight rayon. Super soft. I have no idea what will happen when I wash it!"
5.0,As advertised. Comfortable socks that can be worn to work or causal functions since the stormtroopers icon isn't very noticeable.
5.0,I am very impressed with the quality of the mesh bag.  The draw string used to close the bag is of high quality that should last for years to come. I will definitely be ordering a second mesh bag.<br /><br />Thanks
5.0,Great fit....nicely made too
5.0,"I bought these for my grandson. He was so excited, he couldn't stop bouncing and jumping up and down while wearing them and thanking me"
5.0,"I originally bought just one belt to see the quality ... And since then I have purchased 6 more belts in various colors.  Great for bluejeans, khakis, shorts etc.<br /><br />The ""rivet"" construction is well-made.  I purchased a belt from another vendor that was not well-made and the rivet and material came apart... So I'm sticking with this ""brand""."
5.0,Love these earrings. They are just as described. The quality is great for the price!
5.0,"Have had this item for about a week. So far, very pleased with the quality. It is made fairly heavy-duty. It is a good size and has good color. Hopefully it continues to hold up!"

5.0,Love these dresses!
5.0,The sweater is of high quality material. Not too thin at all. Although the bottom only comes to my waist and sleeves are 3/4 length. Ad picture isn‚Äôt totally accurate. All that said I love it!
5.0,"This is my 2nd dress.. I am getting online to buy a 3rd. I love love love it! its so comfortable, cute, and great material. I am 5'5 170lbs. I have very chubby arms and dont have an issue with it being too tight. I get so many compliments on my dress. I have sent the link to two other people who have purchased a dress as well. Dont hesitate! BUY IT!"
5.0,I love this blue color and how lightweight the fabric is on these workout pants
5.0,"I love the way they are made, and the way they shine. I will be getting more of them."

5.0,"This dress looks great! I love the style and the color. It‚Äôs snug fitting, but comfortable and cut to enhance curves. It‚Äôs a holiday party go to for me."
5.0,I loved them
5.0,They are the best slippers I have ever had. Excellent arch supports and the soles are tough enough to wear outside. My shoe size is 11 1/2 so I got these in size 12 making them just a bit large. Good thing is I can comfortably wear them with or without socks. If I had known they are adjustable may have gotten 11's. Definitely recommend them!
5.0,ITS ALL GOOD !  cool slip on pair  will buy a 2nd pair asap.
5.0,Love the way it wear and feel.
5.0,"I bought this headband for the days when I'm having a bad hair day and I just want to throw it into a ponytail. I ordered the pink green and blue one, and the color is so pretty and bright. It fits my head perfectly and has grips on the inside of it so that it doesn't slip off of your head. It hasn't moved out of place all day so it works perfectly. It's my new go-to headband."
5.0,I can see!  I love my new look.
5.0,I like the fact that this zebra suit is stretchy and is a full body suit. It stretches the fit if you can get into it. I hope you found this review helpful for you and thank you very much for reading it. God bless you and yours and may the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ
5.0,"I'm 5'4 and 180 pounds, size L fits nicely."
5.0,"I can't complain, l am quite satisfied."
5.0,"My son has played on these for months and the shoes still look new. They fit great. He has a bit wider and thicker feet, so it can be hard to find a shoe. These are super stylish, cute for my little 3 year old."
5.0,"Love these, i'll be playing with them soon. (Christmas present)"
5.0,Super cute! Fits perfectly.
5.0,"Small, but great"
5.0,"My husband is very happy with this beautiful and unique gift, a wonderful Father's Day, although you must ask for it at least one month before the date you want to deliver it."
5.0,Well made and nice looking for a lanyard!
5.0,These were great for my Halloween costume. I dressed as Gene Simmons from Kiss! Super easy to put on and take off too.
5.0,I love love love loooveee this wallet! Its exactly what I wanted!
5.0,Good quality and print. Washed and dried few times and still looks brand new.
5.0,I bought this dress for my first renaissance festival and it arrived so fast! It fits perfect I am 5‚Äô7 and 150lbs the only think is that I am tall and this dress was still long! If you are shorter I would probably get it hemmed but overall it fit very well
5.0,"My lenses are solid red. Cool aviators that fit comfortably with nice construction on the arms, well better than the Top Gun knockoffs out there for $2.  The arms pop out and in with no flimsy give to them. Note, the lenses are on the bigger side but not by much, I have a big head so they fit me well. Would buy again in other colors. The price is insane!"
5.0,Super cute! Great gift for all your friends that watch Young & Restless
5.0,This sunglasses was bought for my daughter and she loves it.
5.0,This umbrella is very sturdy. The colors are also beautiful!
5.0,I would like the lens to be a little darker
5.0,It was okay it was definitely high waisted...<br />But at my age... I‚Äôll probably just wear the top
5.0,"My friend and I needed these for a pre-Valentine's event we hosted last minute. A quick Amazon shopping landed me on this product and I liked the dimensions and the fact it is 2 cups in one. I felt I need to post this review coz it really did a great job for our outfits - and again - we're size D cups.<br /><br />I've included a couple of pics so you can see how nicely they actually fit considering the top I was wearing - which was actually a low back.<br /><br />Hint to wear it better: Wash your top area with soap and water and do not use any moisturizers. When holding the cups to yourself, make sure it is where you need them to stay. Hold them in place for a good few minutes and make sure they are sticking to your skin as smooth as you can.<br /><br />This is my second set of these stick on bras and I am loving them, especially to ear for the low front (or back) outfits.<br /><br />Care: I save the plastic covers it came with and after washing it and drying it well, I stuck the plastic back on it to protect until the next time. The next time is actually this weekend while lounging with halter tops on in the warm sunny days of Cabo."
5.0,The bracelet is beautiful
5.0,"This is my new favorite piece of lingerie! I love everything about it. The color, the type of lace that was used. The fact that the straps are adjustable and it actually supports my breast that are above average. I am 5'2, 180 and 36DD and this fits great. I wore this last night and my husband loved it as well. The lace top is slightly stretchy so you can move the cups to the side for easy access. The panty have a cute crisscross pattern for the straps so it compliments the bra nicely. I also love that it is comfortable and I can wear the top for a cute accent with my everyday shirts."
5.0,"This so cute, slim and neat ... love it"
5.0,Excellent as always
5.0,"For is flattering. Great overall stretch, rides up a little but stays put pretty well."
5.0,"After reading the reviews, I ordered the XL for my 14 year old daughter. It fits tighter than I would like  (I would prefer her wear baggy clothing), but nevertheless its a really nice fit with stretch material. What helped me out on sizing was the reviews and exact measurements. My daughter is 5'6 and 175lbs. Typically wears a 14 in pants. Hope this helps the next person"

5.0,"I ordered these for my soon to be 13-year old daughter. She loves them! She doesn‚Äôt workout in them so I cannot review how they hold up with a lot of activity or squats; however, they are basically in her weekly clothes rotation. She says they are very comfortable and fit perfectly."

5.0,"We LOVE our playsilks. My 7 and 4 year olds use them constantly all day long! They are belts, capes, wings, blankets, scarves, baby wraps, oceans, deserts, lava, grass and SO much more :-) These are also our go to gift for other children, friends or family!"
5.0,"Great fit. I was worried the fabric would be too thin, but it was perfect."

5.0,Bought this for myself. The rosary is very pretty and came in its own little pouch.
5.0,"Lightweight, great for warm weather and just what I wanted"
5.0,Easily the second most discussed watch I own(compared to the Whiskey Barrel OG watch I also own).  Instant conversation starter and as a bigger guy it really fits my wrist well.  I'm a fan of Original Grain from now on.

5.0,It is PERFECT. I'm so very pleased. Perfect size for a crossbody purseüíñ

5.0,True minimalist wallet at a great price.
5.0,I got the wrong size .. but it fit my co workers watch . Do I have it to her
5.0,Gorgeous. My grandmother loved it.
5.0,"I'm a 34D, I got a medium. It's not supportive and I spill out the bottom, so I always wear it with a black or strapless bra underneath shirts and dresses. I love it though, and I've gotten so many compliments that I just bought another medium."
5.0,excellent product very good material with which it is manufactured

5.0,Good quality exactly what I wanted and ordered!
5.0,"I like that it came with a few accessories like a microfiber wipe and a pick to help open it. The size was perfect for a picture that isn‚Äôt too small, but not too bulky:) very happy with them‚Äô"
5.0,Loved the store and bought one for my granddaughter..
5.0,Needed this for the wife as she has had bad luck with gold chains kinking and she has a few pendants that require this thickness in order to fit them.  The linked chains are just too delicate and are prone to binding where this snake does not.  It looks great on her and she loves it.
5.0,"jeans size 29, well caught. my hips 98 cm."
5.0,I wore this jumpsuit for a long flight- was SO comfortable yet stylish!  I love it!

5.0,Fits my 13 month old perfectly. It is thin but I like it because she can wear it in the car seat safely!
5.0,"Love the 24x30 bag!  I used it for the first time this weekend.  Tossed in clothing, a pillow, and other stuff.  My pack weighed a good bit but bag showed no signs of weakness or damage.  Another thing, other than saving weight or drying out wet clothing, you can find WHERE your items are in the stuff bag rather than needing to dig through a typical bag trying to find one item.<br /><br />UPDATE: I used my first purchase when traveling.  It worked great in my checked bag to keep things in place after the November flight chaos with TSA not securing the straps in my bag..  No problems with security.  I also just purchased another bag, their 24x36 to use.  Being the first one has held up I'm going to be pleased with this product line."
5.0,Nice plain boxers.  Comfortable and cool.
5.0,Love love love this shirt fit perfectlu even at 2 months pregnant
5.0,I love the memory foam in soles and they look so cute with my jeans and shorts.  It‚Äôs my second pair!

5.0,The edges frayed a bit when I putting them inside my sunglass case.
5.0,Lovely looks very nice and holds up to showering etc very well.
5.0,"Got a lot of compliments and love these alot!  If you are any shorter than 5'3, they may not be for you because you'll have to wear something very short to see the details. Will buy again."
5.0,Very nice quality and feel. Nice rich green color
5.0,"Belt and buckle seem to be well made. I also like that there is no logo/label name on the buckle like one of the other similar belts I ordered. With this belt, the ""excess"" belt is outside the belt; with the other belt I ordered it sits inside the belt (between belt and pants). Just mentioning in case you have a preference."
5.0,Very cute!! Fit was just as expected.
5.0,I love this shoe the arch support  is great we used this a couple of month before he learn to walk and during his walking starting stage. I LOVE that they remind me of the ones I brought with my other children  over 20 yrs ago...just the same Love these I think am gonna broze them!!!
5.0,Fits well.. colorful.. lifts my spirits
5.0,"Great quality belt strap. I have owned and used this for at least 6 months. The strap has held up well. I like the look of nylon natos, and this one is gorgeous."
5.0,"These are a thicker sock and very comfortable, exactly what I was looking for!"
5.0,My Granddaughter wanted it and it is very cute. Arrived on time and packaged well.
5.0,Hermosos!!
5.0,I just love this product. Absolutely perfect for the gym. It is NOT thick and heavy.  I always wear it in the steam room or sauna or after a shower. No more of those too short gym towels they hand out.  Good coverage.<br /><br />If you want a thick fluffy luxurious one this is NOT for you.
5.0,"Runs, large but I love it!"
5.0,"I really love this product - I've been looking for coffee bean necklace forever now, and they all either have weird design, or the bean doesn't look like coffee beans. This one, however, is perfect.<br />The material doesn't smell like metal over time (I wear it everyday), and it's easy to clean; the design is perfect where the bean looks like a coffee bean and it's perfectly sized; the bean doesn't slide up and down the chain though, which is what I prefer.<br />Even though I bought this for myself, the package came in gift-wrapped. So it's perfect to gift it to someone who loves coffee as much as I do."
5.0,Best fit
5.0,"As a veteran, I‚Äôm all about 550 cord. Love the bands, especially the more manly look to it. I don‚Äôt like how the Apple Watch looks. Not my style. But my wife convinced me so I bought it. These bands made it look super aggressive and combat style. Love them. Mines ran a little too big even on the third hole. Luckily I know how to weave the 550 cord and simply cut it to size and looks awesome. Make sure you size it right."
5.0,Cant go to sleep without my eye mask. Great value.
5.0,"5' 1"" and 135 pounds and the medium fits really well with thermal top inside."
5.0,"The material is not too thin or too thick ,structure,I bought this because I need it for some warmth when I wear a short sleeve dress ,and it does well"
5.0,Nice tie  great Price
5.0,Great product..
5.0,"This is a a cute top.  I love the sleeves on it.  It does run a bit small so I would suggest ordering a size up.  I normally wear a large, but got an XL and it fits perfectly.  I am 5'3 160 lbs and a 38-39 bust. I also have a tummy.  The material is a regular tshirt material.  I can see myself wearing this with jean shorts, and low top chuck taylors or flip flips.  I've enclosed pictures so you can see how it fits.  I hope this review helps."
5.0,Beautiful necklace to wear every day. Can't beat the price. Comes in a nice box.
5.0,Very cool wristwatch. Light in weight and good size.
5.0,"Holy cow, these are an amazing value for $25 (normally $30, they have a $5 coupon right now).  I ordered the gray pair and after they arrived I immediately went back and bought the blue as well.  They feel amazing and are very light weight.  They look awesome.  They're polarized.  The collapsable case they come with is worth $10 on it's own.  You want these."
5.0,My 5 year old loves them
5.0,"Sturdy, yet chic.  It is very well made, holds everything I need and then some.  Room for extras, so if I shop for one or two items, I don't need a  bag.  Great for art fairs, too.  Zippers all work and are strong."
5.0,Mom liked it
5.0,My wife loves Snoopy and I am constantly looking for anything Snoopy. There is a lot of crap out there with Snoopy slapped on it and I am always pleasantly surprised when I come across something as well made as this jacket. Thank You!
5.0,"These are great gloves...kept my hands warm, but thin enough to accomplish work and texting, as well."
5.0,Awesome for any snoopy fan! The material is very sturdy! The bag is big and roomy! It's great for taking everything on the go.
5.0,GREAT HAT!
5.0,True to size! My brother loved his Christmas present.
5.0,"This is a very comfortable, nice looking shirt for any daily activities. Only the logo on the sleeve keeps it from being worn to more formal events. It is great for casual daytime use and is very soft material. The material has a sight shine to it, sort of a happy fabric. The side slits look good when worn untucked but I‚Äôve mostly worn it tucked in. The fit is great. It has a slight stretch to the material which allows it to give with motion. It is not a tight fit, but a very comfortable fit. Great looking and very comfortable shirt for any daily activities."
5.0,"Excellent for kids, are flexible material ideal for the kids. Good desing and color. Great price."
5.0,"I really like these! 110 as described! I added some of my jewelry in the box, but I recommend getting these!!"
5.0,A gift from my granddaughter.
5.0,Got a great deal on quality replacement lenses for my Oakley Industrials....Very happy with my purchase
5.0,No disappointment here.  Good quality.
5.0,Really nice earrings!
5.0,Item arrived as advertised.  The bracelet is very delicate and the bezel setting is well done.  The clarity and color of the stone is good.  The stone will change colors depending on the light source.
5.0,I love them. Somehow I thought that they would be more cottony and less knit. But that was my mistake so 5 stars
5.0,Not a bright pink.. more like dusty rose. very pretty
5.0,A good fit. If ordering in USA order size up. Quick delivery.
5.0,Excellent Value. Very solid
5.0,They run small but that wasn‚Äôt a problem for me because I read the comments before buying and I ordered a size up and it fitted great üß°other then that quality was good
5.0,Given as a little thank you and they loved the pendant
5.0,Great wallet. I like the fact that there are 3 windows in it for her health insurance cards and id.
5.0,I got them fast I really cant tell you alot about them yet .she loved the colors and they fit well . As far as any good after wash and dry dont know yet .
5.0,"Cute, cute swimsuit! Fits perfectly. I am 5'5&#34; 145lbs and ordered this in size L"

5.0,Is of very nice quality! Fits as chart recommends and it‚Äôs durable !
5.0,"Very nice looking Minnie Mouse cap.  Good quality, well made, vibrant colors and good sizing.  It does not disappoint."
5.0,"I LOVE, love, love these leggings. The high-rise waist stays in place, and they don't ride down when squatting and doing burpees. These are super comfortable...I was able to wear them all day for both leisure and the gym. The true test of how much I like them is that I bought a second pair in another color! (Picture shows my dark green marl)"
5.0,Third pair and third color I‚Äôve purchased. They look great. Are a little flimsy but worth the buy.
5.0,"Looks like resin, but it most definitely plastic. I still gave five stars though, because this particular band is SO pretty. I love all the different colors. They are also very easy to adjust, though a little time consuming. I have tiny wrists (child-like, and I'm 42) and I can get enough links out, without harming the beauty of the band, and it fits perfectly. I have three like this one, but the colors aren't as vivid. I will most likely be purchasing more of there since I love mix and matching them!"
5.0,"The quality is very nice. It is silk, very soft and as described- you will love it!"
5.0,heavy material and looks great
5.0,"This headband worked great for me.  I am growing out an undercut on my hair (shaved the bottom 1/3 of my head) and wear it with the wider part at the back.  Soft material, just the right amount to cover the back of my head.  Stays in place throughout my workouts."
5.0,These capris are SO comfy and soft. I will be buying more from the company. I plan to wear them under my dresses. Just know that the navy is most definitely not navy it's much lighter.
5.0,i love these ! they are super comfortable
5.0,It's very nice. Warm and very soft. It's a good quality hat.
5.0,"Love these! Super cute and I love the 1st and 2nd ones in my left ear, the most. I have the smallest hoops both in my right ear with the stud and they‚Äôre just perfect. Especially for a 3rd hoop."
5.0,I love the look and feel of this little purse. It's just what I need it to carry small items and my phone.
5.0,It was great! Perfect for my daughter's circus costume!
5.0,Beautiful dress!!!! I would just recommend to get one size up.<br /><br />Wore this Dress for my Wedding and I got soo many compliments!! It‚Äôs just beautiful

5.0,Absolutely gorgeous! Another homerun from MYJS.
5.0,Easy to assemble. Sturdy with water-filled weights. Fully covers seating area on deck.
5.0,These are exactly as expected
5.0,just as adverised
5.0,"Living overseas for a number of years, I saw many visiting friends get their pockets picked. This made me extremely cautious about the way I carry valuables when traveling. I have purchased three of these, and my husband, son and I all love them.<br /><br />DO NOT assume you can wear them on your thigh. They are too tight for that. But they slip around your ankle easily enough and within minutes, you'll forget you're even wearing it. The only way off is over your entire foot, so there's no need to worry that you'll lose it without realizing it. And access is easy. With a money belt, I always had to go into the restroom to access it. With this wallet, I just sit at the table in a restaurant, cross one leg over the other, and access it under the table without anyone even realizing what I'm doing.<br /><br />I don't stash credit cards in here because the way the sleeve wraps around your leg the cards would bend. But I routinely carry large sums of cash in them and they are great for that. The two zippered pockets mean that I can split the money, thus avoiding a huge bulge in one place, and they're so comfy that you can sleep with them on if you're staying in a hostel, or any sort of hotel that feels slightly less secure. Best of all? Despite the metal zippers, they have never set off the metal detector when going through airport security. In busy airports, I always worry that someone will grab my bag while I'm going through the scanner. This way, my cash stays secure. Now if I could only figure out a way to wear them through the x-ray machines...."
5.0,Its hard to find something this cute for plus size. I have a bigger waist and could have sized down. But it still works and I kept it. Will definitely buy more.
5.0,"I LOVE this hat!  I bought my first one on the Goorin website in charcoal and it was so great I wanted another in a different color but they don't make it anymore. I was so happy to find it here.  I have a small head but I find it to be rather stylish and well-fitting.  I have gotten so many compliments on this hat, and it can be worn different ways but I prefer it slouchy. It's nice ande warm too.  LOVE it!"
5.0,"These are adorable. I love anything and everything with sunflowers. üåª They are a bit long on me personally but that is because I am only 5 feet tall!! haha... I just rolled them up a bit.<br /> I made the mistake of putting them in the washer and also the dryer and the sunflower decals started to peel up a bit so you definitely shouldn't put them in the dryer. Besides that, I am really happy with them.üòäüåª"
5.0,Bought these for our 5 year old grandson to go to the Winter Nationals...the fit was good and they worked great.
5.0,"Very nice swimsuit cover. Flows nicely. Kind of see thru, but that's nice for a swimsuit cover. Your size chart is accurate. Thank you."
5.0,"very sparkly, glad i ordered them"
5.0,"I have used this on three morning hunts now,i turn on the heat after i sit in my stand and battery has lasted over the 4-5 hours i have hunted! All three days morning temperature of 30 degrees and i only wear a early season jacket and stayed nice and warm, wind of 15mph on one day was not even a factor! It will def keep me out for longer hunts without the chills"
5.0,"Beautiful, comfortable, right out of the box."
5.0,I bought this sweater for my 11yr old son as a Christmas present and he loved it! He wore it every single day during winter. The material is nice and soft. I've washed it many times and it still looks like new. Good quality light weight sweater!
5.0,This is SO soft I was surprised! Fit perfect and looks great on.
5.0,"Not sure what the delay was for delivery, but it took a long time to receive shipment. The product is great though. Perfect fit and excellent quality - just as expected."

5.0,Gorgeous! They can be adjusted for tighter or loose feel. Very dainty and pretty

5.0,Great gift for a mom!
5.0,Omggg. Elegant. It was the highlight of my wedding dress. Good quality
5.0,"I love Skechers Girls Lite so much, that this is the 2nd pair I've bought for my 7 year old daughter. My priority for her is comfort, and these are some of the few shoes that she can wear without any blisters or soreness in any spots. They are also only 4 ounces which adds to the comfort. Will definitely be buying a third pair as soon as my daughter outgrows these."
5.0,Product worked well to repair the broken attachment for my outdoor pull down screen. Very satisfied.
5.0,Perfect for 3 yr old frozen living little girl! She is obsessed! ‚ù§Ô∏è

5.0,"These belts are great.  Stylish, comfortable, and easy to manipulate if you've eaten a big lunch and need to loosen the belt a little. I've got two now, a brown and a black. They're my &#34;go to&#34; belts when I get ready dressed for work in the mornings. I've only had them for a couple months, so I can't speak to their durability yet, but they're holding up well so far."

I would definitely recommend it!!
5.0,One of my coworkers told me this was a game changer. She was correct. I have asthma and have been at home working for 50 weeks. After going back to work I was struggling with my mask. This has a bridge for your nose. It allows me to breathe air not the fabric from my mask.

5.0,"These crocs fit to size, are beautiful and very comfortable.  If you have a high top of foot (high arch ?), then this croc is good for you because the piece that goes between your big toe and the next toe is longer than the usual flip flop. This makes it more comfortable and I wear them all day long."
5.0,Fun tie

5.0,Absolutely adorable!  My grand daughter loves them.
5.0,"Just received this bag yesterday, but already love it. Nice, masculine look, but not rough-looking at all. Well-built, nice size, and a good setup of extra storage areas complements a spacious main compartment. Sturdy strap and alternate handle for carrying. I would love to see this bag made in a slightly larger size (say, 2 inches each way, excluding depth).<br />Very pleased."
5.0,It is lightweight and comfortable and easy to read.
5.0,Good Dupe for the real thing
5.0,My daughter loved hers and we got one for her best friend. the necklace fit her best friend but needed an extension to fit my daughter which made her feel a bit self conscious. Either way they both were excited to have something so unique and special to wear to their prom.

5.0,"Perfect!<br /><br />5'2, 155lbs. I'm over 8mo post pregnancy and this &#34;blazer&#34; does the job! I ordered an XL, generally wear a Large. I have an average body type.<br /><br />The sleeves go passed my elbows as shown in the photos but I can roll them up just fine.<br /><br />It's definitely a thinner, flowy material than your usual blazer. But it works perfect for this SoCal weather. It won't keep you warm though. Wore it today during a business appointment outside, it was sunny and 75 degrees out. I wore a sleeveless underneath and I was very comfortable!<br /><br />Could definitely wear for business or casual with some jeans!"
5.0,This top arrived on time and fit perfect and was the part of the perfect bachelorette outfit

5.0,I love mesh hats and this one with Brasil's flag is fantastic.
5.0,Finally found period panties that are light and breathable and are also super cute! The color is a beautiful teal. This is meant for lighter days and it's supposed to absorb up to 2 tampons or one pad. The fabric is soft and they fit pretty well and unlike some period panties these feel close to regular underwear. I'm looking forward to wearing these during warmer weather.
5.0,Exactly as advertised. Love this style. It's cute and sassy. Went back and bought two more. Definitely recommend seller.  Quick delivery.

5.0,"Looks great once I put them on.<br />Worked well with a long summer dress or capris.<br />I'm short in height, so these shoes added leg slimming length to the eye.<br />Perfect!"
5.0,Inexpensive and it does the job. I purchased this kit because I was buying my third watch in 3 years and I knew I would need to shorten the band. I took the last two watches to a jeweler and I get tired of paying to shorten the the band that I can do myself. The watch and this kit showed up the same day. I shortened the band easily with the tools in this kit so it paid for itself in one use.
5.0,Such a great find! Love them!!

5.0,Bought this dress to wear at a beach wedding and it was perfect.
5.0,This dress is so fun! It comes in a bag and you need to steam the bottom of the dress so that you don‚Äôt see the back of the fabric (it‚Äôs white). The dress is tied at the nape of the neck and has a zipper that goes down the back. The material is great and fits well!

5.0,I LOVE this bag! I‚Äôm not a purse person so I usually use backpacks as purses and I am so happy with my purchase. The purse came fast and was packaged well. There was no chemical smell and the bag is well made so I know it will last me a while. There‚Äôs lots of compartments on the inside and I love the hidden zipper compartment in the back. I was confused at why you couldn‚Äôt adjust the length of the straps but I just unbuttoned them and let them hang low. I will purchase again!
5.0,This dress was perfect I wore it to a wedding and got lots of compliments. It's very comfortable and stretchy I usually wear a large while pregnant but I decided to get a medium based on the reviews I read and I'm glad I did. 5'2 and weigh 175.
5.0,"Great value heavy weight and well made, my favorite shirt!"
5.0,I receive a lot of compliments on this pendant.  Suggest buying a thicker necklace for it.
5.0,Nice product. I haven‚Äôt worn it yet.
5.0,"This costume was amazing, from the dress to the crown. My daughter is 5. She is 44 inches tall and wear a size 6. I ordered a size 110 and it fit perfect. I was nervous about the crown but it stayed on all day with just the 2 Bobby pins provided. It cost more than other costumes but the material is a lot better. I didn't think it would get here for Halloween but it came a week early. I'm so happy and she loved it so much. She wore it to school and Halloween evening and it still looks good."
5.0,I love the heart inside<br />It doesn't keep the time pass 6 hours
5.0,"Read the reviews about how it runs large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 180lbs so I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs perfect! Better than typical Halloween costume material. Great details, comfy and cute!"
5.0,Love the colors and the fit.  Very comfortable and easy to clean.

5.0,"This product is just what I needed!  Perfect.  Helped me to organize my jewelery and keep it all out at a glance so that I'm not digging in drawers.  So glad I bought it, you should too!"
5.0,"I used these on both leather and rubber Heel/Toes , it was a bit tough to install them in the leather but when they went in they went in good!<br /><br />It was easier to install in the rubber, but they may need additional glue (which is no big deal),<br />perhaps a bit of shoe goo.<br /><br />I'm happy with these heel plates"
5.0,"Oh, my god!  These boots are so cool.  They are attention pieces where ever I go.  I like the pinched heels with rubber sole.  It's the city sleek meets the rugged style.  The red laces give the punch for the fashion.  Very comfortable like my other 3 pairs of Timberland boots."
5.0,This is a very well-designed well executed necklace with a keen eye for detail extremely happy with my purchase
5.0,Wore them out & about they‚Äôre so cute . Definitely true to size
5.0,I have had this watch over a year and the battery life is still amazing. Not alot of features but I just use it to help me keep time and alert me when I have notifications. Very tough and I work in a wet environment.
5.0,Cheap material. But nice style
5.0,Very beautiful and business savvy dress! Texture is a nice cotton. Love that this is an asymmetrical look with buttons curving down from top to bottom.
5.0,I am a straight 2XL in Torrid and Lane Bryant and purchased this in a 2XL and if fit perfect!  I am a 38L bust and the top fit great and my bra didn't show out the arm holes which is always an issue with tank dresses.  I will be ordering more of these!
5.0,"I really love this dress! I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù, and it is long enough for me. I am also on the smaller-chested side. If you are larger-chested, this dress would be too small."
5.0,"I love this purse.  This purse has a very high-end look for a very fair price.  I receive complements on it almost everytime I wear it.<br /><br />As a mom, I am constantly carrying many items in my purse.  I am very pleased that this purse seems to be able to hold a large amount of stuff, without worry that I am damaging it.  The purse is very sturdy and spacious.  A 7-inch tablet can easily fit inside, along with a large wallet, cell phone, and other usual items.  There is a small zipper on the back, two inside zippered compartments, and two inside pockets.  There is plenty of space for everything, and the compartments keep tiny things from getting lost.<br /><br />The main compartment has a big zipper to keep everything inside.  Because there is not a lot of excess cloth, I am not worried about the zipper getting caught constantly, which was a HUGE problem with one of my (expensive) Coach purses.  There are also four studs at the bottom of this purse to keep it clean when you put it down somewhere.<br /><br />This purse has a pair of attached small straps, which I use exclusively.  It also comes with a long detachable strap for people who would prefer to wear it on their shoulder.  I have kept the straps wrapped up in the purse, but I don't forsee a use of them personally.  But it is nice to have options.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.<br /><br />I must disclose that I received a discount on this product in exchange for my agreement to use, assess, and review it.  My opinions are my own, and I hope that they are helpful."
5.0,This was a gift for my grandma and she loooooved it!
5.0,"In a nutshell, this is made with a high level of skill. I have a friend who had done this for a few years and compared to how this is made he had a long way to go. If you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs a no-brainer, great quality along with the price. Hurry up."
5.0,Gloves are perfect for -6 to 0 C. The touch finger works well. Size fits as expected.
5.0,Absolutely love!!

The straps don‚Äôt fit around my high chair but it doesn‚Äôt even matter.  The suction cups are awesome.  The Velcro is strong as a fastener.  BUY IT.
5.0,Son absolutely loves it. I'm impressed with the look and the feel.
5.0,I like the size because it is a little larger than others I‚Äôve seen. I have a large head and these fit me. I have both the navy and black. They wash well but are a little wrinkly when they come out of the washer. I don‚Äôt put them in the dryer.
5.0,"I love these shorts.  They are comfortable and flattering, even on this 71 yrs young woman.  I am 5' 3 1/2"" and 108 lbs, 26"" waist and 36"" hips .  The waist is a  bit loose but the tie takes care of that nicely.  And one of the best features for me is the length.  They are very flattering without looking like I'm trying to dress too young.  I like these so much that I also ordered the pink and the camel.  I ordered them in a size small.  They can be dressed up or made casual depending on what type of top you wear.  Hope they make these in additional colors soon."

5.0,great  I love it
5.0,I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù so it had to be hemmed which is expected. It doesn‚Äôt have much structure but with a bodysuit with a low back beneath it was amazing. It is comfortable and very sexy. It doesn‚Äôt hide your stomach but it shows off your wagon.
5.0,Cute comfortable the split is a little higher than expected.
5.0,Awesome protection not too heaven on the eyes either...
5.0,So soft! We love them!
5.0,"In U.S. sizing, I take a medium, but size Large in this item, could not be a more perfect fit. I was expecting the typical linen/cotton blend that I love, but the material has been treated, and my initial reaction was not a happy one. I then tried it on, and the drape and weight of the 2 garments i bought from Sellse is just...how shall I say... lovely! Comfortable, gorgeous and even wrinkle resistant. I couldn't be happier, and I am extremely picky! I wear the 2 dresses more than any other garments in my wardrobe. Well worth the price. Very satisfied, I am."

5.0,It's a really cute necklace that you can share with your friend or spouse however it comes with a very cheap cord that goes around the neck. So obviously it's not top quality but it's really cute if you want a sentimental gift on a budget

5.0,Great dress. Super light weight. Comfortable. Has slits up side though so be ready to wear leggings underneath.
5.0,"I have long hair and a high ponytail looks best so this hat ended up looking awesome on me and I got several comments from friends.  It adjustable so no matter the size of your head, it will fit.  The only thing I wasn't too fond of is the size of the brim - it's a little on the large size but I'm working on shaping it.  Overall, this is a great product!"
5.0,Heavy duty feel that is comfortable to wear.
5.0,"A fan of Casio for years, I thought this watch would be good for ""everyday wearing.""  I was right - it's durable (like a tank!), easy to read, lightweight, and can take some bumps.

5.0,"Love the green color of this watch and the simple, slim design for a gshock!"
5.0,I really like the lapis lazuli and the silver bead look on this bracelet. It matches nicely with my silver bracelets. The stones themselves are lovely. I am so pleased that I purchased  the aqua aura. The packaging is very nice also.

5.0,Beautiful bracelet!!  Well made
5.0,"I‚Äôm going to buy more in different colors.<br /><br />The fabric is very soft and yes it can show your flaws by the way it just molds around your shape instead of concealing you. Which is why i went with a size up.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù , 175lbs and 36G and the XL fit well, not too loose but not so tight to reveal my flaws.<br /><br />It‚Äôs just a bit longer than I was hoping, but it still comes well above the knees and can be very flattering even though it‚Äôs made to fit loose.<br />The open shoulder and criss cross low-cut neckline are very sexy!"
5.0,beautiful -fabric is good quality and liked packing

5.0,"Perfect! My kindergarten twins can put on their shoes by themselves! Hallelujah! And I don't have to retie shoes 8 times a day.<br />As their feet get bigger, it's harder to find velcro ones. These made the hi-tops my boys love practical. Thank you."

5.0,"Ordered a size large as I wanted a shirt that was roomy... A medium would have fit fine, but I enjoy the loose fitting shirt. The material is very soft and not stiff at all. The color is as advertised, very nice color. The lettering has not peeled after several washes. Great shirt."

5.0,Purse was exactly what I was looking for
5.0,this was a very nice vest.  i love the tapering and it is made of good quality materials.  the only down side was it was more of a burgandy than a red color.  Otherwise very pleased with this purchase

5.0,perfect shirts
5.0,"My 2.5 year old loves to dance like a ballerina. She goes through these little dance costumes so quickly because once we put them on, she doesn't want to take it off all day--even for bedtime! So they get stained and ripped.<br /><br />This particular costume has held up so well. We've washed it several times and all of the stains have come out. The bottom hasn't frayed or become damaged at all--even with all of her time on the playground and in the yard.<br /><br />The design does have built-in undies, so my young daughter does need help pulling it down to go potty.<br /><br />I can tell she feels like a beautiful ballerina in this costume...it's so fun to watch her twirl and dance in it."
5.0,"If you have someone who is like family but technically isn't, this is the perfect sentiment without going overboard.<br />It conveys what you want to say, its really cute and he loved it!"
5.0,"This isn't a particularly well made skirt. The button hole was opened and it smelled awful right out of the package. So why did I give it 5 stars. I'm skinny and it fit. I bought a small and I don't have to get it altered. My guess the size is around a 00. By the way as an older woman, I appreciate the longer length and flattering drape. It washed well."
5.0,"Love this dress, wore to a work event, a wedding and it washed well in the washing machine. Great thick fabric for a sleek look."
5.0,Quality and very cute
5.0,"My has curves and large breast, she thought that she would never be able to wear a sexy little number like this, and especially without a bra. SHE WAS SO WRONG! This dress fits and hugs all the right places and with comfort to boot! Great colors and a great look. Wear it with sneakers for a fun day look, or a pair of sexy scrappy heels to turns heads at night. My wife does both in this. These images were to prove to her that you could not see her nipples in direct sunlight"
5.0,"I got this to give as a gift and he loves it. The N64 consol is very nastolgic for him. He actually had this exact hat already but lost it on a beach. He was super bummed when he realized he had lost it but was very happy when I got him a replacment. It's comfortable, thick, soft and good quality. Fast shipping."
5.0,Great summer non-skid socks for use in the house.
5.0,I love it üíì<br />Same looks like photo Super nice and does not seem so cheap to like the picture. In reality seems an expensive necklace. Very nice and would recommend if I loved it.
5.0,Really like my handbag .... only wish is was real leather ..
5.0,"Collar precioso y de alta calidad. Muy vers√°til, lo recomiendo totalmente! ‚ù§"
5.0,Great selection and feel great!
5.0,Brightens up my mornings with these happy and cheerful colors ! Love it !
5.0,"The best rash guard I own. The feel is great. Movement is completely natural. I recommend this without hesitation. There just is no comparison between a professional rash guard like this and the common brands. Wet or dry, it is comfortable. If you are in-between sizes order up. (I'm usually a medium in t-shirts, sometimes a small; the Fourth Element's medium size was appropriate). I bought the long sleeve version before it was on Amazon - I had to import mine - and I admit it was the silk screen design that drew me to it. Now I'm an advocate. I'm aware it usually costs more. But even if I had only a fixed amount of money I'd choose one more of these over two of any other more common brands. Though I wish the black version had more color options for the piping/silkscreen - the women's black version has fuschia piping that looks darn cool, which I think guys could pull off."
5.0,"I don‚Äôt do yoga, I purchased this because the description said it is very stretchy and not see through material. I like to wear the yoga pants daily and I tried it, the material is great as it described. The pocket design makes the pants look better and more convenient for the phone. I like it so much! Also the high waist makes your tummy feel warm and comfortable. I am very pleased with the purchase this time. Thanks Amazon for the such great quality product listing. Definitely recommend it to everyone."
5.0,Gave as a gift. Reciever LOVED it!!  He has been getting lots of compliments on it!!<br />Thanks!!
5.0,It's a must have if you have the printer.  Fits snugly with space for extra labels.  Decent quality.
5.0,"I love this sun protection shirt.  Design is great and the fabric is very soft and lightweight.  I will use it for tennis and golf,"
5.0,This jacket is so nice and comfortable. It also fits true to size. Its great if you work out of doors or if you work close to traffic or even for hunting. The reflection it gives off is more than adequate. You will most definitely be seen. Perfect safety jacket. I would definitely recommend.
5.0,Just as described. Very soft fabric and the print is not bulky. It may be a little bigger but that's fine with me since these kids seem to be growing out of things way too quick.
5.0,Very warm and cozy for wny thank you Amazon
5.0,Product came exactly as described.  Used for graduation tassels and they looked great.
5.0,Un poco pesadas al caminar pero gran producto
5.0,The fabric is almost like a liquid which he doesn‚Äôt bother me a little bit of shine on the fabric
5.0,"Good grip, nice to have one for my new iPhone 7"
5.0,A nice gift for someone special
5.0,"Peeeeerfect, bright colors, super soft!"
5.0,"Was larger than I expected but still very pretty.  Looks nice on a thicker, longer chain because of its size and weight (kind of heavy) but still is a very pretty and nice locket.  Also stainless steel so it shouldn't turn."
5.0,LOVE THEM.  I will order more!!!!
5.0,I can‚Äôt wear heavy pierced earrings.  Making pierced into clip is so easy
5.0,Very well made and easy to wear...
5.0,LOVE THIS SHIRT! fits great. I get tons of compliments! Love the material. Its not to clingy and hot. I am 5'7 and 190lbs and ordered a xxl.
5.0,"I love this bag for several reasons. First this is the second one I have owned and they are very sturdy and strong. It's nice and roomy and I have a few smaller cases that I use and place inside to sort my things.  It's a very nice bag all around and very pretty.  I would buy this again. Also, it came quickly and nicely packed by the seller."
5.0,"I've been wanting this locket since the show first came out, and I am very pleased with the result. It arrived 1 day earlier than expected, still in original packaging, and exactly as described. Only thing is that the locket is a little difficult to open, but i think that it's just a manufacturing thing. Otherwise it's perfect."
5.0,These joggers are cool and casual and a good fit. They hold up well to exercise and great for lounging on saturdays on the couch.
5.0,"So many women at my church have asked me about this set, and love it. I am pleased with my purchase, all though the ear rings could have been a little bigger."
5.0,"Product looks great, and the chewed-up sunflower shells in the package were an added bonus."
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress!! For the price, it's an absolute steal!! I am super short(just under 5'1&#34;) with a small frame, and this dress actually fits!! I got the XS, and I didn't have to hem it. I also love that it's opaque enough that you don't need a slip or tank underneath."
5.0,Comfortable and great for any setting
5.0,"We bought a small and she‚Äôs between a 3t and 4t. It‚Äôs a little loose but still looks cute. Love the length off this costume perfect for a little girl. It‚Äôs well made and durable, not afraid of stitching coming loose while she plays in it."
5.0,"Love this ring. It feels great in the finger, the inside is so smooth"
5.0,This is a very pretty dress . It‚Äôs not fitted at all so it‚Äôs perfect for work .
5.0,So soft and expensive looking. I got the purple and its gorgeous. Very well made.
5.0,Just the perfect size and color.  Small but very interesting!
5.0,"Feels flimsy, not comfortable at all no room to breathe. Feels to tight when placed on face."
5.0,Love this skirt. The material is very forgiving and fits well. I'm short so it hits below the knee which is fine with me! The texture is soft and smooth.
5.0,"I now own 7 of these.  Beautiful, easy to clean, and keeps liquids hot for a couple of hours. They do crack if dropped but holds up well to normal use.  The lid sometimes needs to be adjusted to prevent leaks but a quick check usually resolves this."
5.0,"I absolutely love this stuff. I mink oil my belts, shoes, boots, sandals, etc... This stuff softens the leather a bit and helps recondition and waterproof it. I‚Äôve had daily worn boots that I‚Äôve used this stuff on and they lasted 10 years. They were still in such good shape that when I bought new boots, I applied mink oil to the old ones and sent them off to Goodwill for someone else to enjoy."
5.0,So comfortable and easy to wear
5.0,great and very cute
5.0,"Very cute, and fits nicely!"
5.0,"I was a little hesitant buying online, beautiful dress.  So glad we bought it."
5.0,I love these RayBans! They are beautiful!
5.0,Little bigger than expected- longer
5.0,They worked great! Brought back 2 bottles of wine from Portugal.
5.0,"The hat and mittens fit my 7 year old perfectly. They seem to be well-made, and the fleece was nice and thick. They are very cute!"
5.0,"beautiful ( price,color,style,length)"
5.0,"Like many people, my leisure time is almost always spent in jeans. So I'm very critical and demanding about how comfortable they are primarily, second how they look, obviously and finally the quality of the stitching and the denim composition. I discovered Joe's Jeans and they instantly became my overwhelming favorite despite an eye watering price, at least in my opinion. I bought multiple pairs of one model of dark blue to assure having them for years to come. These Genuine Assembly Skinny fit jeans arrived and I was immediately struck by the weight of the package. they had heft that might indicate a substantial jean. They have ""skinny"" right in the name so I was prepared to snake into them and pronounce them uncomfortable like compression socks. But I didn't. Though the lower legs are slimmer, I'm not sure I'd call them skinny at all. Maybe slim fit is more accurate. Surprisingly, as other reviewers noted as well. the waist area, even though they are my standard 32 inch waist, were actually a little loose. No wearing these without a belt. But once belted the fit is almost perfect for my form. I love the fact that the pockets don't have some obnoxious stitching that screams No Style Taste, though even expensive jeans can go off the deep end with cheapening details and over design. These have clean lines and an efficient cut and look. The stitching is even and secure. Areas are faded, but in a way that makes it look the most convincing of any pair of jeans I've owned that makes it appear this was caused by genuine wear and washing and not some contrived exaggerated design or acid torture process.  Like many jeans today, the length is a standard 34 inches. I wear 32 length, but the extra length allows you to roll them into a cuff if you like. I coincidentally just bought a pair of sueded Chelsea boots, and these jeans were made to be paired with them, including the extra length. I was asked to review these jeans as a preproduction model so no price was listed on the amazon page. My Joe's Jeans retail for almost $200, so if these are anything under $150, I'd say they are a good value since they should last many years of wear, the material is comfortable with just enough stretch, and the fit, while not exactly skinny as advertised, to me is a more user friendly and comfortable ""slim"". Highly recommended! These are more casual and less dressy, serious looking than my deep blue Joe's, but they will get nearly the same workout in my wear rotation."
5.0,"Received for Christmas and absolutely love it.  Roomy, inner and outer pockets and awesome color with nice long strap to use over shoulder."
5.0,I like the way it looks and the lava rocks hold the smell of the essential oils for a significant amount of time.
5.0,Printed on a glidian shirt with a tear off tag. Screen print is sharp and on point! Over all comfortable fit.
5.0,Super cute! Not as soft as others we have but still adorable. Always get compliments!
5.0,Beautiful necklace and it‚Äôs holding up perfectly. Daughter loves it.
5.0,"Great bag for grocery shopping. My daughter like it for the cat face design though. Oh well, it's very sturdy."
5.0,Purchase for my daughter who just swore in to the Air Force.
5.0,Producto de buena calidad.
5.0,"It is true to size  I went 1 size up and was loose, the back part is way too high I have to sew it, I'm 5'1 and weight 145, so as I got large instead of medium I had to make a little adjustment, quality is not too bad, it is ok, but the price is too high considering the material, however I will recommend it. I got many compliments"
5.0,Great and special birthday gift.  Fast shipping!
5.0,I like the material I should have order 1 size smaller.  The built in cups are wonderful.  I am ordering again.  Ty
5.0,"Absolutely fabulous!!  Beautiful, very light weight silk and in gorgeous colors.  I bought two and I think there will be more.... so many choices."
5.0,Purchase this for my niece super cute. She loved it!!!!
5.0,Everyone compliments these. Most think they're expensive designer shades. I love them!
5.0,It's a nice shirt. It feels soft and it looks really nice. I managed to get the shirt a week early without any problems.
5.0,the material was a bit itchy but overall very nice garment
5.0,Photo doesn't do this justice. Perfect. Especially for $37.00!
5.0,As recognition for a marine bravely fighting cancer
5.0,Loved the pattern.
5.0,"Items as described, comfortable fake rings. 18 of the pieces are silver and gold colored, of the same style, and the other 2 are great. Love the one rose gold piece"
5.0,"Item was supposed to take almost 2 weeks to arrive but got here in 2 days, which is awesome! It's big and shows up well which is better than I expected! I'll be looking for more nose studs from them!!!!"
5.0,Excellent quality and perfect fit.
5.0,"I love this dance costume skirt. The fabric is soft and smooth, the multi colored skirt is easy to find a matching top and the style is great for Latin dancing."
5.0,"Great mousepad! The surface is super smooth and clean, and the mouse tracks very well on it. The rubber backing does a great job of not slipping on my desk, and is incredibly stable. It takes up a ton of room, but I have the space for it on my desk, and I actually consider the large surface area to be a huge plus. If you have a small desk, this probably won't work super well for you, since there's not enough room to set your keyboard on top of it.<br /><br />Overall, would definitely purchase another one of these if I needed it."
5.0,This jacket is lightweight and looks sharp.  Fits perfect and the price was great.
5.0,Great product and my dad lovers it!
5.0,"It is very comfortable, and fit great! I could definitely see myself buying in other colors, if needed.¬†"
5.0,Superb quality. Boyfriend loved it for his birthday.

5.0,"Love love love Gravity Falls. This was a gift to my son and I'm jealous, I should have gotten one for me too. The details are perfect and it is a beautiful necklace for a boy or a girl. Great job making this Haida, it is absolutely perfect."

5.0,Lovely just like picture
5.0,l‚Äôm absolutely in love with this shirt. lt looks really nice and sexy.
5.0,The strap works great with my Dime Dean From Hell guitar and it looks cool.
5.0,I love them! Also got here pretty fast
5.0,very bright and vibrant
5.0,Super cute ! I wore it for a Halloween costume. It does fit a bit larger so I would order a size down.
5.0,Muy hermoso
5.0,"I love cubic zirconia studs and love pink, so I thought, why not look for a pair that featured the best of both worlds?  they arrived quickly, have a great sparkle to them, and I have not taken them off in a week!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful woman‚Äôs top. I purchased it in black, and want it in every color!  It‚Äôs a well-made, elegant top with a high end feel. It‚Äôs flattering, comfortable, and would look equally beautiful with jeans, pants or a skirt."
5.0,"I love everything about the t-shirt.  I first purchased the grey and found it to be exactly as described, including the slight sparkle in the fabric.  After experiencing how well the t-shirt washed and dried, I decided to purchase the black.  It too has sparkle in the fabric.  I appreciate that the fabric is thicker and the design is slightly fitted.  I normally wear a small in women‚Äôs sizes but sized up to a medium based on the size chart and reviews.  I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 110lbs, and 34B and the medium fits me perfect."
5.0,Well made. Larger than I expected. Good quality.
5.0,Great for the office or work setting. Beautiful color I ordered a size up for more room and longer lasting I would recommend!
5.0,It's fits great.

5.0,It's great & warm
5.0,Cute suit.  Bottoms are a little big but leaves room to grow.
5.0,Really beautiful good quality earrings! Love them.
5.0,nice shirt! love it!
5.0,"This is a nice scarf. The velvet has a real deep black pile, not like velveteen, and it is two-sided, so I can twist or wrap it in any direction. It's just long enough to go twice around your neck and cross in front, and it keeps the wind out. I also like it draped and loose in front."
5.0,"They seem pretty sturdy. I've had 2 in my lip and my boyfriend has had one in his for a few days now. No loose balls, they dont get in the way & they're super light in weight. Loving the matte black color as well! The balls can be switched around enough if doubles are needed... but for best results, I may grab another. It'll help even it out a bit. Definitely recommended!"
5.0,Great with garter belt.<br />Smooth and smokin.
5.0,"I just love it,super comfortable"
5.0,"Loved the mask. Use it in place of so-called medical masks when entering restaurants. Gets me a laugh or two. They weren't laughing at the bank, though. LOL."
5.0,These glasses look pretty nice and get the job done. They don't seem super sturdy so I pretty much just leave them in my car in the shell case they came with when I'm not using them while driving.
5.0,The Vine wood wand is very nice and authentic looking. I didn't want the resin/plastic ones available. The velvet bag it came in is sturdy as well. My 9 year old daughter thinks it looks just Hermione Granger's from the Harry Potter movies.
5.0,"I haven't taken it off. Through showering, running and doing yard work it still looks great. It doesn't irritate my skin or tarnish. For $10, you can't the price, plus its cute!"
5.0,Happy with my heart
5.0,"Nice details, fits perfect.  Great purchase price"
5.0,Good product my husband loves it
5.0,I can see where my keys are at the bottom of my purse.  I liked it so well that I ordered another one for my daughter-in-law for her birthday.

5.0,"I loved this dress! The style , how it fit me! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 with a size M dress . I loveeeeeeeeee it!"
5.0,"Always liked Russell sweatshirts. Trouble is, they're hard to find in the stores where I shop so it's been awhile since I've purchased one. Glad to find them at Amazon. These sweatshirts keep their shape, are thicker than most, and fit great. The cheaper made sweatshirts lose their hip-hugging ability quickly. Not Russell. You can't beat the price either."
5.0,I brought this for my husband's birthday/Valentine's Day and he loved it. The watch even came with two coordinating bead bracelets. It came in a cute cardboard type box. Great purhase!
5.0,I am very happy with my kimono fit perfectly and looked just like the pictureüòá
5.0,My niece loved her shirt!

5.0,I like the glasses however the nose guard is uncomfortable
5.0,Awesome product! Heavier and sturdier than I expected. Fast shipping. This is a must have if you have a screw on back on your watch.
5.0,The fit is awesome
5.0,"They are good for anything, sunglasses, phone cords, pens and pipes of any kind."
5.0,Gorgeous! Dainty and light ...love it!
5.0,The bracelet looks just like the pictures. The bracelet has got some weight to it! It feels very quality. The stones look very pretty. I love it. Definitely worth the money!
5.0,"These are really cute- almost too fancy for me to wear to work. I was thinking they'd be a bit smaller, but the stones are pretty big.<br />Great for fancy wear!"
5.0,"Love it. Pulls on easy, very comfortable and cute. It has just enough length to hide your stomach. Great fit"
5.0,"Wow, from the way it arrived packaged and wrapped to the quality of the belt there is really nothing more to say then I want this belt in other colors. It is a beautiful belt and made really well."
5.0,"I love this bag! I was very weary of it before buying. I was nervous it wasn‚Äôt authentic and also that it would be too light for fall/winter. Um, no. It‚Äôs verified Kate Spade and it‚Äôs magnificent. The colors are dark enough for my fall attire and I‚Äôm in love. Hello, new friend."
5.0,Buena tela no se transparenta buen adjuste .en la parte de la barriga..lo recomiendo..
5.0,I love these they are so comfortable I would buy agsin
5.0,"5' 7&#34; 125lbs. Lean/skinny athletic build, broadish shoulders, widish rib cage, narrower hips.<br /><br />I bought a medium thought I usually buy small in the US.<br />It was a little tight around the chest and shoulder, but still fit flatteringly.<br />Would consider even getting a large, but I'm pretty happy with the medium.<br /><br />Fabric is heavier, quality seems really good especially for things like this.<br />Tie is the only thing that is a little cheap.<br /><br />There's a side zipper on the shirt as well as the skirt."
5.0,Looked great on could use other than a costume
5.0,"i really like it and just right for me put some small things, i recommend this kind of product,bag"
5.0,loved everything wish they had more colors. would buy them all.
5.0,"Awesome!  This towel is big and soaks up water, my daughter is 11 months old and in the 70% on height and it is perfect for her.  We should get at least another 6 months to a yer out of it.  Washes well too"
5.0,5'9&#34; 160 - ordered XL and they fit great<br />Great panties! I thought the bows on the front would fall apart quickly however they all have stood up after several weeks of washing. The lace has also held up very well and none of the stitching has come apart like others have said. I wash these on gentle cycle and machine dry.
5.0,Was awesome didn't get wet a bit.perfect fit for all ....
5.0,Soft and lightweight but good coverage

5.0,"My boyfriend just graduated Power Lineman‚Äôs school and i bought this bag for him because he will be traveling a lot on storms and will be in crappy weather. This bag is beyond what i expected. Extremely durable and feels like it will last a long time. Also it‚Äôs freaking huge. Worth every penny. When i gave it to him, he was so pumped and can‚Äôt wait to use it! Carhartt- you did it again, awesome product!"
5.0,Good Price. Good Product.
5.0,Very Large super soft purse
5.0,Such a great shirt. Really good quality.
5.0,"I didn't think I&#34;d like this dress when I first saw it out of the package, but when I put it on it looked way better than expected. I added a black skinny belt with gold hardware and got lots of compliments. I'm 5'2&#34; and 108 pounds and the small fit perfect. Not too long."
5.0,I really love this shirt. Fits well
5.0,"This dress is amazing!! I didn‚Äôt expect much but when I received it, it fit perfectly and the material is great! It looks like it could cost $50. I‚Äôve gotten many compliments on it already. I wear this dress for work and also for dinners with friends."
5.0,"Fun, pretty, can be dressy or not...Love them!"
5.0,Love this mask for easy breathability. I do not use the inserts and can breathe fairly freely through it. It is far less suffocating than any other I have tried.
5.0,"I use these for every travel. Love how light weight they are and takes no space in my suitcase or backpack while keeping everything organized. My husband did not believe in them at first but after going on a trip and realizing how much easier and organized my stuff was compared to his, he started using them for our trips afterwards. One package is enough bags for 2 people. Would not travel without them!"
5.0,goes with most anything
5.0,"FSM, greatly detailed replica of his noodling noodle Ness. Spaghetti, tomato and pinch of basil, throw in a few meatballs a side of garlic bread and a nice chilled rum."
5.0,"I really like this hat.  It keeps my head covered and protected from the sun, and I noticed that my head doesn't sweat the way it does with other sunhats.  It's also a bit dressier.  I'm pleased with my purchase."
5.0,The first pair I bought I wasn't sure if the husband would like them or not.  HE LOVES THEM.
5.0,Love this very fun to wear. Received it faster than I was told and well packed.

5.0,I loved it &lt; it has nice color and style
5.0,I got the pink with black polka dots and it's beautiful I love how soft it is and it's pretty long :) great buy
5.0,Tall enough for a six foot man to fit over the calf. This is the second time ordering the socks.
5.0,"I absolutely adore this robe. From reading the reviews I was a little afraid to wash it, but I did put it in the washer before wearing it and it is just as soft and fluffy as when I received it. I ordered a large even though I usually wear medium because I wasn‚Äôt sure about the sizing and I‚Äôd rather it be too big than too small. I wish I had ordered the medium. I‚Äôd say it fits true to size if not slightly bigger. I am still happy with my purchase, though. It‚Äôs long, which will be nice for the winter. I will update after more washes."
5.0,Don't know how well it will fit our baby girl but it's very well made for the price. Very happy with this purchase. Can't wait to see how it well it fits. The bow I had to untie because it didn't look right and would have been huge on a newborns head but it did come tied and I really like this outfit I recommend 100%
5.0,Very happy with this necklace. Girlfriend really likes it.
5.0,"The material was much thinner than I bargained for. However, it's only $5 so you get what you pay for. It fits like I want it to and if I wear a bralette or bandeau under it, it will work just fine."
5.0,"My son- in- law loved it. Came with papers, cleaning cloth. Very impressive."
5.0,Came as expected. Super comfortable and pretty! Cannot wait to use it for my engagement shoot in October!!
5.0,My favorite shorts! Comfy and stretchy!
5.0,Nice t-shirt for summer.
5.0,"This is a spectacular wallet for the price! It has so much room inside, and designed to perfection. I love the decorative drawstring, as I can slip a folded grocery list under it - no more searching about for my list in my purse! When I first saw the picture, I assumed the drawstring opened the wallet in some way, but it doesn't - there are 2 snaps. It is a very pretty wallet!"
5.0,This shirt is very pretty.  Runs a bit snug in the chest area if you‚Äôre looking for a loose fit.  I am reordering in a bigger size.  Also I‚Äôm a petite size as well and the length is just right.
5.0,"Lovely, soft leather with multiple zip pockets: perfect! Great &#34;new leather&#34; smell, too.Comfortable backpack straps, very important to me. Will buy again if this ever wears out; looks as if it will last forever! Great buy."

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and it fell perfectly to the floor still covering my feet but not dragging
5.0,"I bought this for my clear event bag, I‚Äôm going to some concerts. Seems to be well made. It‚Äôs small, but surprisingly holds quite a bit. As long as I don‚Äôt overstuff it...it should last a long time. I would not put more than one card per slot. No designated place for coins..but bills will fold up nicely. Quite a few card holders. Probably won‚Äôt replace my normal wallet, but this will be just fine for what I need it for."
5.0,So wonderful to have a pair of shoes that feel so comfortable!
5.0,"Realmente hermoso, me encanto"
5.0,"Love it, more beautiful in the person"
5.0,"I love white sweatsuits, this one is cool"

5.0,I am slowly replacing all my yoga pants for ones with side pockets. These are great quality - soft & snug. And such a great price I don't feel guilty buying the same colors I already have.
5.0,Great quality. Which there were more colors
5.0,Quick shipment.  Item looks as advertised.
5.0,"I love having these gloves to use while grinding my stained glass pieces. Before using them, my hands would be so sore after working a few hours. Now with these amazing gloves I can work as long as I need to complete my projects."
5.0,üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
5.0,"WOW you can look through this little puppy.  Yes, straight through this thing.  The cover glass is a nice ‚Äúmagnifying glass‚Äù that gives this watch an added bones in my book.  It has a chain and a clip that will secure the watch to my pants."
5.0,Cute. Five stars for product but not complimentary for side boobs. Had to take away a star on myself for that. Lol.
5.0,"While I'm not a fan of the little pins that hold the band to the Versa--that's the Fitbit and not the band's fault--once I got it attached I've not had issues with it coming apart. I wear my Versa daily and basically only have it off to shower and to charge it. Really pleased with the purchase, if they had more colors I liked, I'd have bought them all."
5.0,"This piece looked like something you would find at an estate sale and would be enjoyed by anyone looking for antique looking costume jewelry. Too, the colors allow it to be worn with anything, especially the matching necklace."
5.0,My wife love these
5.0,Very Awesome!! My husband LOVES them!
5.0,"Same brand/quality as the other masks that looks like this one, but $10 cheaper than the sellers that offer prime shipping.<br /><br />Order date June 21.

5.0,Love the mask! Fits perfect and love the design!
5.0,"Oh my word this is by far my favorite purchase off of Amazon of all time! The top fits perfectly and is super flattering ;) I‚Äôd give it more stars if I could. It is a LITTLE see-through, but not blatantly sheer. The fabric is thin and breathable. The buttons are perfect and this is exactly what I wanted."
5.0,My wife was very happy with this. Thank you!
5.0,I love it! Comfortable enough to sleep it.. and it doesn't stretch over time
5.0,perfect gift for changing link for cross for husband
5.0,Excellent chain for my pocket watch. The link type was a perfect match and the ring clap is big enough to clip on the belt loop of jeans .I am thrilled with this chain.
5.0,"I bought this dress for my birthday karaoke night. I didn't need anything fancy, I just needed something fun. This dress was that! It was cute! It was body forming! It was tight but comfortable! I received a lot of compliments on this dress and now need to find another reason to wear it. It is a little see through, FYI. I wore tights beneath it because it was cold but will be cautious in the future so as not to show too much."
5.0,Husband LOVES them!
5.0,Beautiful dress! The fit is true to size and it‚Äôs very comfortable. Perfect for summer! I‚Äôll be buying one in every color available.

5.0,"They look great on my baby!.  I was worried about quality and durability when purchasing, but they are holding up well so far."
5.0,"I am the patriarch of a clan of Swiftys.  Wasn't my intention, but it happened none the less.  But, when she plays So-Fi in August, Tay-Tay will see my wife in the superfan section wearing the anthem of the day around her lovely neck.  A couple of our kids and their spouses will be there, too, but will have to get their own TS bling.  Me?  I will be home with the dogs."
5.0,"Perfect fit, and comfortable."
5.0,Wearing an saling
5.0,This swimsuit is exactly what I was looking for. It was given to my sister as a gift. She has An ileostomy bag unfortunately and is intellectually challenged/ developmentally delayed. I am her co-caretaker along w/my mother. It's important to me she feels comfortable and not embarrassed/ashamed of her bag protruding.  This suit not only hides her ileostomy bag perfectly but it also is flattering. I highly recommend this swim suit as it is beautiful on and incredibly well made!
5.0,I love them. The steel is just what my ear lobes need.
5.0,"I bought this for myself since I am a Star Wars fan and have to say I loved it. It is an original Lego product, great quality and Darth Vader even has a cape. Fully recommend it to anyone needing a keychain like this, you won‚Äôt regret your purchase."

5.0,Gift for my son.  He‚Äôs 6‚Äô5‚Äù and loves it b
5.0,"Buying socks unseen can be a risky proposition, you never know how they will feel or fit. I was happy to find that these are very comfortable, definitely recommended. They feel like they are well constructed and that they will last. I will update this review over time if they do not.<br />They are not super thin like some other socks that i have purchased, i'm looking forward to seeing how they hold up over time."
5.0,Really warm. More for people with big heads

5.0,Beautiful. Made well. Sturdy. I've had it since August how and no issues at all. :)

5.0,This is so much better than a cheaper bandage that I used. It really snatches in your waist. I also love that there's no wrong end. You can pull as loose or tight as you want. No bulge under my shirts.
5.0,I wear size 12 ladies and these are a little tight on the upper thigh.  They are great quality and comfy otherwise.  I found a larger soze that are way too large.  The material os super soft and good quality.

5.0,Perfect for something light to throw on over whatever

5.0,Muy realista y buena calidad
5.0,My daughter loves the pants and wears them at college
5.0,"Bought this fleece hoodie for mountaineering/hiking layering. My previous fleece didn't have a hood, so I picked up this one. It is fantastic. Great, durable fabric. The hood fits perfect under a helmet. It's not meant to be wind proof, but it is a great thermal layer under a shell layer; or great for hiking with a slight breeze to keep you cool but not cold. Not to mention it looks and fits great."
5.0,Fit my jawbones perfect
5.0,rather thin.
5.0,Fits as expected. Comfortable and nice color
5.0,Lovely gift. The recipient loved it.
5.0,"This is my first time wearing any sock during my yoga practice, and I think my search is over.  I am a yoga teacher, and I bought them to save my feet...I am barefoot so much of the time that my feet were getting very dry and unattractive. They stay snug about 99% of the time. i couldn't ask for more.  I will have yet to find out how long they last....but so far, so good.  They are comfortable and easy to care for.  I feel like I'm barefoot!  I'll be buying another set soon for sure.  I bought them in natural, I may try the black this time :). Thanks for a great product."

5.0,My husband likes the look and feel and all his cards and drivers license fit fine.
5.0,Very nice quality. Bracelet a little small but still nice overall.

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:8e881efde039c9076d8e81882b2edf32]] Great quality! I got a Medium, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 & 145-150lbs & glad I got the Medium, because I know a Small top would be GREAT for me, but I can just tighten the top by sewing it tighter. The bottoms were perfect!! The thigh high leather like material was barely able to fit my thick calves so be weary of that! Any smaller of a size ordered I would‚Äôve had to return it & the same goes for the bigger sizes."
5.0,I love this shirt it fits great and can wear with almost anything.Very satisfied customer!
5.0,This dress is gorgeous. I thought the beading was silver but its black. It's still very pretty and lightweight.

5.0,These are very beautiful & I‚Äôve been wearing one of them everyday since they came in

5.0,"LOVE IT!!!!!! I've been trying to find the perfect one piece that's a flattering fit all over the body. Definitely suits a curvy body and hides and lumps and bumps you have in the tummy area. I'm usually a L (36D) and ordered an XXL (according to the size guide) and it fit great, the chest area was flattering and also supportive!"
5.0,"Very good quality bag, however, will likely review again in a few months to show how it holds up. It arrived quickly and is exactly as described and pictured."
5.0,I love the way these pants tie up on the side.  Nice a cool. Color is spectacular. I am 5'1&#34; and this is not too long.
5.0,The eye of horus holds great power.  These work too effectively as protective charms.
5.0,"I bought these for my mom for Christmas. She had another set but lost the necklace. After looking everywhere for a necklace to match the earrings it was impossible! So I went ahead and bought a new set of both. She loves them and wore them for the first time the other night, she loves them. The look great, are delicate looking, with a little blue ball above the boot. I must say they are great looking and fancy at the same time. We both love them."
5.0,Bought as a xmas gift & my friend loves it
5.0,Arrived very quickly and exactly how pictured and described.  The only very small complaint is that it came in a small plastic bag so you will need to find you're own little gift box if giving as a gift.
5.0,Nice!! They look so sharp on.
5.0,"My 11 year old daughter loves these swim suits!  They fit great, arrived on time, and were a great price!"

5.0,I bought this for my 5 yr old That is a big baseball fan and player to wear to school and he loves it.  He likes that he can wear around his neck and just pull it up when needed.

Would buy again great seller fast shipping

5.0,Sweatshirt was great fit as expected I ordered a large but I like to wear things big and it did shrink once it was washed
5.0,"These are better quality than others in similar price range -  wide, cushiony and absorbent.  Have since purchased more - I give them as prizes to my tennis group.  I especially like the fact that they are packaged (with 2 in each) individually."

5.0,"I bought this as an anniversary present for my husband and he absolutely loves it! It's really beautiful - looks a lot nicer than the price tag. I was intentionally looking for a sophisticated watch that would not break the bank as we have 2 young children and, well, things can happen :) The band was a little tough for the first few days, but as he's been wearing it over the past week it has softened and formed better to his wrist.<br /><br />- Keeps time well - so far my husband has not had it lose time in the week he's had it<br />- Looks wonderful - he's gotten several compliments as it is visually interesting and looks high quality<br />- Great quality<br />- Great price tag"

5.0,"This can be customized how you choose and I chose to put our girls night picture and a saying on it. Well I ordered one and waited to check quality and let me just say I LOVE IT. I loved it so much I order 3 more one for each of the other girls in our group. This keychain makes the perfect gift for men or women for their birthday, anniversary,  wedding,  fathers day, valentines day, Christmas,  Thanksgiving, or any occasion to let your loved ones know you love and appreciate them. The keychain is stainless steel with a white transparent acrylic surface cover to help protect the color of the photo inside and it looks just like the original photo.

5.0,I didn't have much expectation for the quality because of the price.  But at my surprise the quality is very good.  These are nice pair of leggings.  The color is nice and have pockets to put my phone in.  The only thing is I wish they are a little longer then they will be perfect.
5.0,"This was a first communion suit.  Worn for that then for his cousin's first communion and associated celebrations. I washed it in the washer and hung it up after a quick trip thru the dryer.  Flawess.  Comfortable and will be worn as many times as possible before it's outgrown.  Perfect.  Reasonable priced.  PS I didn't wash the tie,  will  do that by hand id needed."
5.0,Very nice fits perfect
5.0,"Great rehearsal dress! Make sure your nude undies match your skin tone, can be slightly see-thru in the sun! Love the fit!"
5.0,"Wow! What a gorgeous dress at a great price! Bought this for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the material (felt heavy and sturdy) and very impressed at the overall look and feel of the dress. I'm a little under 5.6, 138lbs and it's a perfect fit, couldn't be better if it was custom made. Excited to buy more from this brand!!"
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this, it's nicer than I expected.  The length is good for me, which is unusual (I'm 5' 2"").  It's not too long, and the fit is good.  It's a little wrinkly, but I suppose that's to be expected due to the material.  I can't speak for durability as I've not worn it out yet."
5.0,loved this dress wore it on my vacation and got so many compliments one it!
5.0,"I love this, it is so pretty I just lounge around in it."

5.0,"Daughter loved, a little hard to get on and off but that gives it a good fit."
5.0,Was skeptical because of the lack of reviews but it‚Äôs exactly as pictured! Perfect fall sweater.
5.0,"Excellent color and texture, definitely recommend (especially in a Merovingian knot )"
5.0,"My boy used them for months, awesome for the hot weather days"
5.0,"I liked that the sox were knee high so basically over the calf. The compression fit was really nice. I don't like it when calf high socks consistently fall down, These socks will not fall down."
5.0,Unfortunately the dress did not work out.  At first we thought we were out the cost because the refund label required us to pay postage which was over $100.  We contacted the seller and they sent us a prepaid return label.  Thank you seller!
5.0,"Beautiful skirt, I feel as though I am in a romance novel running through the lavender fields. In all seriousness, though, this is going to be my most beloved skirt. It is long, and I have a 36-inch inseam as a 6-foot-tall woman. The pockets are perfectly placed, and the materials feels great on my skin. Five stars."
5.0,"I love this coat it is exactly what you would hope, very flattering fit, great quality."

5.0,"Buy it! the fabric is good quality , the dress drapes very nicely, the color s are just like the photo and the fit is true to size"
5.0,My maid of honor will love this as much as I do
5.0,Just a little small but nothing you can‚Äôt fit
5.0,I'm very happy with the Aussie Chiller.  I have a big head...so finding a hat that fits has been a issue.  Most fitted golf hats that say Large/X-large are a bit to tight for me.  I like that the hat keeps the sun off.  I have used it on warm Arizona golf day... wet it... and it does keep you a bit cooler.
5.0,fits really well
5.0,Bought this for my 2 year old nephew and he will NOT take them off. He loves them
5.0,I loved it so much that I bought another in a different color!
5.0,"I liked everything about the socks, I like the fact that they don‚Äôt look like hospital socks, but they are nonskid and won‚Äôt slip. They fit perfectly."
5.0,My Granddaughter absolutely loves this dress.  It fit her very well and she is almost 7yrs old.
5.0,I'm 5'2 and weigh 110 lbs and this shirt fits perfectly. I saw a lot of comments talking about how weird the shoulders were but assuming this could of been made by an Asian company so something like that is to be expected. Although I did not have any issues with it. The material is not very stretchy and is the kind that you would see on professional work shirts. It's not a see through material.
5.0,"Hold pants up great. Only problem is it falls off of the belt when you use the restroom seated. But easier to us then the clip on or button on type,"
5.0,Bought this for my son.  He says it's very warm and he likes that you can keep your hands warm with the covers.  He rides snowmobiles with this jacket.  It fits him well.
5.0,Very nice cardigan. Well made and fits as expected. I will be buying more of these.
5.0,"I love these bumble bee earrings.  I had a pair and lost one and could never find any I liked as well.  Finally, with these, I am happy.  They are very cute and came promptly after I ordered them."
5.0,Fast delivery! Great quality. So happy.<br />‚ù§Xüíî
5.0,great quality...!!!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:52ea50d85df32dff4181d3eafddb5a3]] This dress was for my granddaughter!  She looked beautiful.  Not too grown.  We were attending a formal evening wedding.

5.0,looks better in person
5.0,La tela es transpirable...
5.0,I bought these pants for cosplay and I like the way they fit. They are very comfortable and light which is perfect since the convention im going to will be in the summer when it's quite hot outside. Im a size 4 aka 27 in jeans and the small fit me perfect

5.0,Great protection in a lightweight shirt.
5.0,Absolutely love these. Work great.
5.0,They're great. Very warm and comfortable
5.0,Loved this dress especially for the price. The front was a little low and the split was a little high but it worked for where I was going. My husband and everyone kept complementing me on the look.
5.0,"I expected the chest not to fit based off other reviews but a medium in the yellow striped fit well- I'm 5'6"", 36DD, 140lbs and wear usually a 6 or 8 in pants. If I wear a nude colored bra I won't need a slip since there is a thin slip sewn in for the bottom half (in the photo my bra is a lavender color and it's a little visible). I wish it was a little shorter, but with heels it'll look better in my opinion. A nice summer dress."
5.0,My daughter begged for a mermaid swimsuit & Im glad I found this. She's in her second summer wearing it and the bottom of the shorts have completely rubbed off so now it's black. But i'll still give 5 stars because it was a great purchase!
5.0,Great fit. Washes up nicely.

5.0,"This dress is amazing! It fit perfectly, it‚Äôs comfortable and I received many compliments. The rhinestones are good quality and sparkle."
5.0,"This ring is a very pretty shade of pink and the quartz stone is approx. 10 mm across. So far I have purchased 5 of these in various colors and they seem pretty durable. Personally, I love them."
5.0,"I don't know why I thought this would look good on me. It's a great quality dress and looks the way it's advertised, but it's definitely not for curvaceous women with strong or wide shoulders. Depending on your body shape, it either looks awkward or not modest enough (for me). Great dress, but definitely not flattering or modest enough for everyone"
5.0,The shoes are absolutely beautiful!
5.0,Very pretty and delicate. Clasp could be sturdier.
5.0,I‚Äôd buy more
5.0,Very well made and can‚Äôt wait to see it on my granddaughter. Perfect size for babies.

5.0,Dainty and charming
5.0,"I like the quality, after one year the color fade but it totally worth it"
5.0,Great belt with buckle that sits flat. fits into most of my short and jean loops.  I hate the look of the lump that is created at the buckle and this sits as flat as any while still providing some support. I purchased in the tan and white.
5.0,I got 36&#34; necklace and it looks totally sexy but koo...I only take it off when I shower other than that its always on...
5.0,"Adorable, and flattering on me. I have plans to wear it with a crinoline, for extra skirt poof."
5.0,"Perfect, I‚Äôm in love."
5.0,great - works as advertised and is sturdy.  good product!!
5.0,we originally ordered these solid ones as well as striped one and we ordered medium which was too small.  This Seller was great for the returns.  We ordered two packs of the solid in large and they fit.  I would recommend this seller to anyone.  They are great.

5.0,We ordered these for our wedding. They were great and everyone liked them!
5.0,"This is a great shirt.  My husband's wearing after rotator cuff surgery.  One recommendation is to buy the grey color.  He has a black and a grey and it's hard to see the sling position against the black shirt.  Not a big deal, but since it's important to wear the sling correctly, it's much easier to do a quick visual check against a color other than black."
5.0,My favorite hat ever. Will buy this design multiple times.
5.0,"Wife loves, awesome price"
5.0,they were perfect!
5.0,Perfect!!! Long neck which I love love love!
5.0,"Looks great, bought it as a gift.<br />Everybody compliments on it, especially if the person wearing it is in the medical field."
5.0,"Extremely warm and comfortable. Dont worry about the elastic strap on the inside, it breaks in quick just walking around the house. A little tight with socks but hey, who needs those anyways?"
5.0,I love this dress. I didn‚Äôt have any and this was a perfect one to start with!  I have gotten MANY compliments on it!
5.0,My 12 year old daughter loved it
5.0,"Oh, I love this ring!!!! It fits well and is high quality. I would purchase this over and over again!"
5.0,Great socks!  I'm buying five more pairs. My feet have been swelling since back fusion surgery.  These socks alleviated the problem.

5.0,"I Love this material, it fits perfectly and I would buy it in every color and print if I could."
5.0,"My sister got me 2 pair for Xmas and I immediately bought 4 more pairs. They are the best socks I have ever worn, as the slightly tighter band around the arch is very supportive. You can just feel how well made they are. I also love the fact that it's a ""buy one give one"" scenario. I feel strongly we should help others (even if it is to just buy expensive socks). I'll never buy regular socks again."
5.0,Pretty girl
5.0,"Love how it fits and feels, although, I did send it back for a different color."
5.0,"Wow...what a great jumper!!  I‚Äôm always a bit weary about buying clothes online, cause approx. 90% of the time, they don‚Äôt fit. This is my new favorite outfit!!!  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 138lbs and bought a medium. I was afraid it would be way too long (which is normally the case, but not this time...length is perfect!  It fits great in every way!! Did not shrink when washed  I highly recommend!"
5.0,"I ordered this to wear to a 90‚Äôs party and I love everything about it, from the colors to the comfortable fit! I got several compliments and asked where I got it. Buy it, you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
5.0,These are worth the money
5.0,Beautiful! Dainty and exactly as it was described. My daughter will love it I'm sure for Christmas this year. Would recommend to anyone this product.
5.0,"My son is a HUGE fan of Ethan Gamer TV and this is his new favorite shirt.  It's soft, the fit is right, the torso is on the long side, but I like that.  It looks like a 'worn' or faded t shirt and it's soft like it has been broken in.  Based on the picture I expected it to be bright red and white and heavy cotton and it's not.<br />Very happy with the shirt, it also arrived way earlier than Amazon estimated even during the holidays!"
5.0,It gets tangled up easily but it's really cute!
5.0,Purchased two of these tunics (royal blue and lilac) for preteen daughter as modest school clothing to wear with leggings. We are pleased with the quality and fit of our purchases.
5.0,"Good fit and well made, not too thin"
5.0,"I've had problems with some capris that fall down as I work out until I sweat, then they will stay is place. But these capris stay in place right from the start. They are true to size, and I'm very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,"Great value, prompt delivery and an excellent gift for my wife."
5.0,"I got this because my mom got diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer October 7, 2020. We all shaved our heads November 13th when she had started losing her hair. I wear this to support my mom and others that had to go through this."
5.0,Great mask - adjustable and well made
5.0,Very cute. Kind of bulky but my daughter loves it.
5.0,"Works exactly as listed. They look good, things look good through them. They fit over my regular glasses well. A little tight on clearance, but the listing gave the size measurements, so I knew that going in. Very pleased."
5.0,"My Mom had hip surgery,  all the underwear she tried was so uncomfortable . I bought these for her and she loves them, and this makes me happy."
5.0,Was gift for grandson.  He loves them!
5.0,I really like these shorts! The length is great. I also like the elastic in the waistline since I‚Äôm a little thicker in the middle. I‚Äôm definitely buying more colors!! Thanks
5.0,Worked perfect to cover my small wrist tattoo. It didn‚Äôt irritate my skin and I even forgot i was wearing it sometimes.
5.0,"Excellent product. Fits nicely, looks wonderful, feels like it was made just for me. Took a couple of days to soften up and mould to my wrist. I like to find cheap watches and put nice bands on them. This went on a $10 Timex I bought and it makes it come alive. I really like this watch band."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful and very well made. The dress had a strange smell to it but after hanging it up for a week the smell had went away. My daughter looked so so beautiful in this dress for my nephew's wedding.
5.0,The tie was very nice and it came before the date that had been established. Great product! I was very pleased.
5.0,Necklace and charm are beautiful. Great price!
5.0,My daughter loved this bracelet for her bday.
5.0,Not too big great size for holding a small purse all boarding passes and flight information plus a few little goodies that you need when you‚Äôre on a plane it‚Äôs a sweet little bag to carry long and doesn‚Äôt get too heavy
5.0,"I was surprised the quality was so good! It was heavier then expected with several layers in the skirt. Fit was perfectly formed to my body. I ordered 2x I'm 5""4 185 pounds for reference. Pardon my bathroom picüòÇ"
5.0,"Love them so far. Hopefully i never need the protection, but glad to have it. You know, because of the OTHHHHER drivers, lol.<br />No but seriously, i wear a SM/MD in mens (normally a MD/LG in womens) and ordered a SMALL MENS.<br />Fit perfectly. Feel good and so far comfortable."
5.0,"Great little cardigan, especially if you are at that age when your arms are not looking as good as they used to look."

5.0,nicely made and looks fabulous!
5.0,I am super excited about this jumpsuit. So excited I'm almost tempted to overlook the hole that's in the pant leg. Going to return this one but order the exact same thing this suit is amazing. I'm 5'10&#34; and I can wear heels with this.
5.0,Very good clothes protection & easy to clean.
5.0,This is my second one.  It is very comfortable. Even though it seem large it is flattering.  I've received several compliments.

5.0,"I was so surprised when these came, the packaging was okay, and the timing was amazing, did not take too long. But the quality of these rings are very nice, it is a very strong metal, very shiny. I must say, I was concerned with the bigger rings, they turned like a brassy color when I touched them, I have no problem with it though, just thought others might want to know. :D"
5.0,It fix me very well. And it's warm enough for Pittsburgh's winter.
5.0,"A little smaller on the fit, order 1 size up to be comfy.  Not fleece!! Def no scratchy seams and pilling, washes amazing, and doesn't shrink."
5.0,O wish I can be little kid again this is nice t shirt my cussing liked my family said is to chipper i told them kids don't care how expensive cloths is is just dress somting nice don't need to be expensive he loved that good enough for me.

5.0,"Great fit, enhancing any feminine look"
5.0,"Perfect earrings for a little girl, very responsive service and support. A great experience."
5.0,Just a little big for a Large but that's ok. My son loves them. he says they feel warm & soft! He's happy!
5.0,"These are VERY chic and stylish Leggings. They lend and edge to any outfit combo. . I'm 4'11&#34; and 110lbs and these fit nicely. . They are a little long  but you can't even tell when I'm done putting my outfit together. I don't think they're quite warm enough for cold weather but they're so cool  looking,  I have to wear them anyway"
5.0,"VERY cat eye... somewhat vintage.  They are a little stiff... but if you're wearing them just for fun... Eh.  It's fine.  . FYI...I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info be useful.  Further,  I do not receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews... my purchases are VERIFIED and full price.  100% independent purchases.  As are my reviews 100% my own and unbiased in any way. However, remember they are my opinions which may differ from yours."
5.0,Perfect little bag. I was a little hesitant on purchasing these cause I thought they were too small but they are perfect for gift bags and children trick or treat bag. They take vinyl great and they were all in great shape. Would buy again.
5.0,VERY BEAUTIFUL.
5.0,i got this as a gift for Christmas for my son.  He is 38 and can wear it to work in an office where they are allowed to dress casual. ...I believe he will like ittoo
5.0,Exactly what I expected ! Only issue is with length next time I will go with a large
5.0,Fits great. One problem-it says floral but those &#34;flowers&#34; are skulls!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
5.0,BEAUTIFUL AND WHAT EXPECTED
5.0,"I hope these are back in stock soon. I should've bought several of them once my 13-yr. old son told me how great they were. They were the perfect teen-sized fit for him. Not too small (like a child's fit), nor too large (like adult fit). He used them for baseball and they stayed in place, shielded the sun well, good coloring, appeared to be scratch-resistant. They were extremely durable and withstood his very aggressive type of play on the field. I was expecting the only issue would be if he lost them or accidentally left them at the ball field. Instead, he left them in the yard and they were no match for the lawn mower."
5.0,"The picture shows a light blue color but description says navy blue. I went by the description and it was good, shirt is navy blue, fit to size."
5.0,Fits well. I usually wear a medium but am curvy so I always opt for the larger size on bottoms.  Great coverage for older mom who still wants to wear a two-piece boogie boarding with my sons.  Doesn't slip down!
5.0,I would of loved to keep this suit but unfortunately it had no support in the chest area. It does have built in pads but nothing that offers support for a medium to large busted woman. Otherwise the thickness of the material was great and the cut was cute.
5.0,"Love this suit.  Very sexy, and it is my favorite swim suit.  It is slimming"
5.0,Just what I have been looking for. Good quality.
5.0,Simply Elegant !! These are perfect for the ‚ÄúWatch Geek!‚Äù
5.0,"Fit I'd average, not particularly warm, although you do get the inclination to devour worlds and set out for the high seas in search of souls...sometimes though, you just want to operate...photo is from my site vdmsr"
5.0,I purchased these pajamas as a Christmas gift for my best friend. They are incredibly soft and cozy. Can‚Äôt wait to give them to her as she is a cat lover and the design is so cute. I think she‚Äôll be very happy.
5.0,I have officially sworn off of bras with straps.  These bras stay in place and don't roll up.
5.0,"All of these are cute, head a hard time choosing which to use first. I use these as a card holder at my desk for my job, and they work great. The hold the card tightly and don't tip over."
5.0,Its awesome!!
5.0,"These are great ‚Äúkicking around‚Äù shorts for the beach, hiking, or just hanging out. I primarily got them for walks on the beach. They have lots of pockets for collecting shells, agates, etc., with room left over for my wallet, sunglasses and keys. They‚Äôre well made, and the fabric is a sort of medium-to-light weight cotton chino fabric. Not heavy or stiff, but also not flimsy. You can see in the photo with the fabric scrunched up, how thick the fabric is. The seams are consistent and very well done - with multiple lines of stitching. The elastic waist makes them very comfortable, yet you can also use a belt if you don‚Äôt want to show the elastic waist. I found these to be even nicer than the vendor photos show. The elastic drawstring at the bottom of each leg, lets you cinch them in a bit and make them look ‚Äúcooler‚Äù and more laid back. Very true to size. I definitely recommend."
5.0,I have a little hip clip purse that I wore everywhere. The best thing is that you can use the clips on any pants or jeans and they stay put. and won't let go even if you tug on them. I had to reorder one clip because I let someone else use it and they tried to clip it on a belt and sprung it. Just don't try to clip it on anything but fabric and you will love it.
5.0,Very comfortable. Good quality
5.0,"The material is so soft and comfortable I have several nightgowns and pajamas made by this brand, washes well and stays soft and beautiful"
5.0,Hubby LOVES. Said they are well worth the $20 for one pair of socks if you play basketball regularly.
5.0,Very delicate looking and sweet. Great for my tennis buddies on their birthdays that‚Äôs why I purchased a few.
5.0,"I brought one last year, my son lost it. This is the second time we brought it again. Good shape, good quality. Fitted 10 years old,"
5.0,My hair was rubbing and breaking off under my bike helmet.  These seem to really help.
5.0,"Good price, quality is soft and fit is right for the size.  No problems to report"
5.0,This dress is amazing!! It fits comfortably and is flattering I all areas. I LOVE it!! I love that it's classy but shows a little bit of cleavage and has a sheer mid-section. Friends and family told me I looked stunning! I will definitely buy more dresses from PattyBoutik!!
5.0,"I love this cardigan!  It is great quality and works great for high-waisted pants, skirts, or dresses.  I wear it almost every day, and will definitely purchase more colors."
5.0,i like that its good for summer and winter
5.0,"Top quality. The Gun Metal Matte is a good match for Apple Watch Space Gray. Two tangs allow for a custom fit, big plus."
5.0,"My lower legs are swollen.  I was diagnosed with lymphatic edema.  My doctor advised me to wear compression socks.  I tried these, but they were too small, even though I ordered the size recommended in the chart in the listing on Amazon.  Fortunately, returning them was easy.  But they appear to be of good quality, and certainly look great--I love bright colors--and were a great value for the money:  3 pairs for the same price as other brands cost for only one pair!"
5.0,A pack of these will last a year. They look great and do what I need them to do.
5.0,Love these! Great price and quality. They fit my 2 year old nicely and and have some room to grow with them. The shipping was very fast and it came from China! Will be purchasing the other colors!
5.0,Bought this for my father-in-law who is a devote Christian. It appeared to be nice quality. He liked it. Good buy.
5.0,Great quality. Fits my son real well. Material is super soft. Well worth the money.
5.0,"Great earrings, fun colors"
5.0,Nice sweater.  Good quality and fits well.
5.0,"Super cute, but I feel needs to be more covering or maybe thicker."
5.0,"Great price, and great size! This was a great buy, the fit was great, very true to size. I'm going to get this item in all the colors, it's perfect for ballet and gymnastics."
5.0,"Love these white shorts, they fit perfectly, although a bit see-through so I'll wear a longer top. Recommend!! I bought a large and I'm 5'4&quot; and weigh 132.<br />Update: I just love the fit of these and I'm ordering more. I like the way they have spandex and hold in my baby/operations stomach!!"
5.0,It‚Äôs good quality lace.
5.0,A lot of fun for a party.  Hat runs small.
5.0,LOVE this brand!!! Fits ALWAYS in my size!
5.0,This dress is really hot and sexy the material or fabric is nice and thick it does not feel cheap. It was just a little too small for me and I did not want to force the zipper so therefore I am going to have to return it but I do highly recommend it. I purchased an extra large I am a 38 triple D size 14 and u s stands and dress
5.0,"These are really great gloves. I have used a number of different cleaning gloves and they all have their challenges, but I like these because they do not have a cotton lining. I've found the cotton on the inside of the gloves gets gross after a while and is hard to clean.<br /><br />I did not measure, but instead just ordered a medium. There is no way my husband could wear these, but they fit me great - a normal sized woman. I like the length and they fit my hands perfectly.<br /><br />These gloves are made with latex, which I was a little nervous about at first because we tend to avoid latex in our house, but I had no issues. The cuff on the 'sleeve' is really nice to keep the glove in place. I used them to wash our dogs and they worked great."
5.0,"Love the length, fit, and so comfy."
5.0,"Great quality bag! Just love it! Zippers all worked well, fabric sturdy. Love it!"
5.0,"This was perfect for swming in the Springs that are always at 72 degrees! It went on and came off easily. My daughter is almost 7, is about 48"" tall and 52 lbs."
5.0,"I use these to sleep. They are very comfortable. As other reviews have mentioned, they are a bit low cut, so that's something to know if you are wary of that sort of thing"
5.0,i bought these bands because my silicone bands seemed to be causing some rashes making me believe i have an allergy to silicone and i bought these bands and haven‚Äôt had anything since buying them!!
5.0,Bought for my wedding dress was a great mermaid but not what i was looking for
5.0,i love it but they arrived with a noticeable tear in the back
5.0,great quality & perfect staple piece to have!!! LOVE IT
5.0,"Have gotten many compliments on these. Now if I could find matching earrings, I would be a very happy girl."
5.0,This is super cute on.... although a little tricky to figure out the ties at first.  I have baby scars and this covers them great.  I'm a size six and ordered large on top and bottom.
5.0,This was better than I expected! It‚Äôs a quality keychain and so cute!
5.0,I love these socks. I never thought I would like the low cut or no show socks but these are perfect to wear around my house on my hardwood floors.  The bottom of the sock has a nice cushion and are very soft.  The no show sock fit better than I thought they would.  Really nice socks.
5.0,Very nice belt and evrybody thinks it's real.
5.0,"We ordered this for my kid in her usual size for her swim class - when it arrived we were disappointed because it was at least an entire size too big. She'll grow into it but yeah, keep it in mind when ordering."
5.0,"Good quantity for good price. They are so soft. I use them for my power banks, glasses, chargers ,mouse for my computer and more. You can avoid scratches on your stuff with these. Also you can clean your screens, glasses or what ever is delicate. Good deal."
5.0,"I'm surprised and appreciative of the quality of this dress and the attentiveness of the seller.  I've tried on several dozen different dresses and this is by far the best one.  Some of the ones that I tried were double and even triple the price of this dress and this one is still my favorite. It's soft and made really well. Quality fabric and sewn well. The seller even added some accent jewelry which was a total surprise and really pulled the dress together.  Ordering online I was afraid that the fabric was going to feel really cheap, and it did on some of the other dresses I tried. But this dress is beautifully made and I feel elegant in it.  It is the one that I've chosen to get married in."
5.0,Purchased to go with a sleeveless dress and it was the perfect color and fit.
5.0,Love the pins from this seller.  Excellent quality and so beautifully done.  I couldn't be happier.
5.0,I bought these dresses for my daughters. They were going to a party and these dresses were Great! Fit well and looked beautiful on them. Would purchase again.
5.0,Bright colors. Fabric feels cool and comfy.

5.0,I ordered this skirt to wear to my birthday and it didn‚Äôt disappoint!! The fit was nice and it was super comfortable all night.
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù, 182lbs. This dress is great to work on my office. Great material. Well done for Chinese dress.  Super summer/spring trendy. Love it."
5.0,"As this watch received reviews starting in 2015, it's interesting that it's still for sale. That says a lot about the particular model. I've collected a number of Rolex watches and even owned this particular model in the past. It's a great watch but was discontinued by Rolex and replaced by the Date Just 41 which has a movement with significantly improved power reserve. The comment that it needs to be shaken to keep it running is rubbish unless they did something to damage the movement. As for the comment regarding the disregards of other plights by buying such and expensive watch. I wonder if they also have issues with people saving for retirement. Clearly a successful, 25 y/o (now 31 y/o) doesn't have retirement in their sites. Rolex watches aren't just watches but the vast majority or them appreciate with time. Much different than the sub $1000 watches which are advocated. Buy a cheap watch and throw it away in a year or two. Buy a Rolex and keep it forever and have it increase in value. Seems like a no brainer to me. In 2015 this was selling above retail; now they go for much more than $200 above retail."
5.0,Purchased for 8 year old grandson.  Bright colors and fit true to size.  He put it own and keep on for 3 days.  Had to make him take it off.
5.0,This robe is so soft! I like that it's not thick and heavy.
5.0,"I bought this dress for a July wedding. I was very comfortable both in the hot sun and on the dancefloor later in the night because the fabric is breathable and not too heavy. Originally I bought a size 4 but had to exchange for a 6 as the fabric really has no stretch and I couldn't zip it around my ribcage. For reference, I'm 5'9&#34;, 145lbs, and wear 34D. Size 6 fit me perfectly. The lace pattern makes it look delicate, but its still very sturdy and high quality. It is quite low cut, just FYI. Overall a really great dress and totally worth the money, I will definitely wear it again."
5.0,Good quality hat
5.0,"I love this product.  however, my fingers are fat, so the didn't cover my fingers."
5.0,Looks exactly like the pic. Love it

5.0,Beautiful and soft.
5.0,Larger than I realized. Other than that satisfied costumer
5.0,Great for softening up my stiff leather boots! Added a nice subtle shine too!

5.0,I love the length and fit. It's nice and loose.
5.0,"Looks nice, perfect size, every day use"
5.0,Great quality üëç
5.0,I like these glasses so much. They looks exceptionally stylish and really make things much sharper while driving. Also they are quite lightweight.
5.0,Beautiful pearl necklace! Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,"The bags are awesome! They are sturdy and hold a vast amount of product inside. The only issues I encountered were the carrying case should have a handle to make for easier transport. Also, they are not the easiest to unfold and get the board inside of them if you are in a hurry. So possibly finding a way to allow the board to remain in the bag itself is a possibility. However, the pros outweigh the cons by far!"
5.0,"totally happy,that I got it"
5.0,"Sturdy, lightweight  and  moves nicely. We will be using the set in a few days...let‚Äôs see how it holds up v√≠a AirPort..."
5.0,"I thought this was a great buy! Wanted to give my friends some light scarves for Christmas, and when I found I could buy 2 for about $3.50 I was sold!! I recienved 2 identical lovely leopard light scarves. Kind of like a chiffon/silky type of light material. the pattern was very pretty and cute. The size was perfect, looked like a super trendy slouchy scarf. Both my friends looooove their scarves! I would say shipping took about 2 weeks - 4 weeks. such a great buy!!"
5.0,"I love the leggings so much I'm buying more, and I prefer these pajama leggings."
5.0,Great product!! I bought these for work so I don't have to worry about losing my expensive one and I am 100% happy with my purchase!!
5.0,Beautiful dress! true to size and the length is just perfect.  I'm 5'3&#34; tall and it sits above the knee. The style of this dress hides my&#34;not so fit&#34; body specially in the stomach area. Love it!
5.0,"Love it!  I'm 5'8&#34; and 155 lbs and the large is perfect.  I especially like that the arm-holes aren't too big, so my bra won't show, and the material is on the soft-side instead of being stiff.  This will be a go-to tshirt this summer."
5.0,Everything was so wonderful. It fits as expected and looks even better in person than the picture shows. Very comfortable and it came folded nice and neat in a zippered bag. Really wonderful and worth the price. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,Ordered it for a gift. The recipient loved it.
5.0,My daughter in Oklahoma loves them.. Thanks
5.0,"I have never bought underwear over the internet before this, but it has been such a wonderful experience, I plan to do it again. And when I do, I will be buying the same underwear, because, as I said, it been wonderful."
5.0,I absolutely love this sleepwear set! The quality is nicer than expected and the fit is perfect for my body type (XXL) - it makes me feel super cute! I am so glad I purchased this ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5.0,I love this color and the feel of these pendants. They are delicious
5.0,If you calfs are extra large you will be pleased with those boots. I have very large calfs and these boots fit great. I would order more from Rose Petals as soon as I can.
5.0,Good dress belt and much less expensive than I've encountered in retail settings. Would purchase again
5.0,Walking is so much easier
5.0,Perfect light weight sweater
5.0,"Nice weight!  Really pretty!  Bought this for a friend, but I may keep it for myself!"
5.0,love. definitely went a size down like othes said and it was a good decision. very good quality and washes great. love
5.0,I was concerned that this shirt may be low quality because of the low price but the fabric is soft and thick and it is well made.  The printing is clear and of good quality also. I am very pleased with my purchase. I received the shirt in 2 days (much quicker than promised.)
5.0,Love the fit I got and XL but that‚Äôs cause I like my hoodies to fit big and loose. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 about 165 pounds.
5.0,Sooo comfortable and adorable
5.0,Love this cuff!
5.0,"Soft and warm, easy to launder, simple and exactly what I wanted."
5.0,"As a woman who wears a larger size bra, I am leery about buying bras online, and not tried on. I was excited when it came in the mail. I tried it on, and it fits! I love it."
5.0,Product is good quality for the price
5.0,Just the right item and quick delivery
5.0,"Great quality, nice packaging, arrived as promised"
5.0,Love them !!!! Took them to my local Lens  crafters and had my eye prescription filled .<br />They feel light not heavy . Sit nicely on my nose .
5.0,"This could not be cuter! Fit is excellent, very high quality for the price, and has lots of retro glamor!"
5.0,LOVED THIS DRESS!! Will purchase another color! I am 5‚Äô4 190 large breasted small bottom. I usually wear a 12 however to be safe I ordered a size 16ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I wanted to be safe. The dress was a little big in waste and bottom but because of print it wasn‚Äôt terribly noticeable. I will order another color in a 14. Print hides any bulges or rolls you might have. Great material as well. I also purchased the hat through Amazon. Received tons of compliments!!!
5.0,I really like these shirts.  I've bought 2 of each color because I like them so much and I'm afraid Blackhawk will stop making / distributing them.  I'm 5'11&#34; / 230 and wear an XL.  They are very comfortable and easily conceal a GLOCK 19 in either an IWB or OWB.
5.0,I us3d it for a gift.
5.0,Bought for Halloween and it is great. I played with the ears a little I wanted a more bent one side instead and the other ear I made it more pointier and it looked perfect.
5.0,Love this bag and can't wait to travel! It will hold a ton and will fit on my luggage handle. Really versatile and handy
5.0,"Loving this band so far. I really hope it holds up and by the feel of it, it should. It‚Äôs heavy enough to be comfortable and not light to feel flimsy. I didn‚Äôt have to remove any links so it might be on the tight side for people with wrists bigger than 7-3/4‚Äù. The band itself measure about 6-1/2&#34; when closed, add 1-1/2&#34; for the Versa for about 8&#34; total circumference.<br />I do like the small levers because they stay hidden within the Fitbit cutout but can be difficult to install if you have no nails. The Fitbit‚Äôs levers are longer and thicker but didn‚Äôt seem to bother me when I wore it.<br />This band definitely compliments the Fitbit nicely! I would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade from the rubber or woven bands."
5.0,It was very hard to find white gloves for a man but I knew Amazon would have them. Im very glad and pleased with my item
5.0,gave it to our teacher to wear around st. patricks day. super cute to wear.
5.0,"Excellent service, fit great, proper length, what more could I ask for!"
5.0,"Fit perfectly, comfortable and good quality material"
5.0,What can I say my second invitation and they just wow me every time. I just love there make and look
5.0,"Fir the price,  great snow boots for the kids"
5.0,bust was small.but still fit
5.0,"The only issue is the bottom of the dress is a little see thru, will need to wear a slip"
5.0,Excellent and wonderful
5.0,"Good fit, adjustability works good.  They do the job I needed when at the range"
5.0,"The fit is adjustable and soft against face, not abrasive!"
5.0,"5'6"" about 190lbs and the XL fit perfectly! I was so surprised by how thick the fabric was, not cheap at all. My ONLY complaint is that the sash needs a better way to stay on like tiny hidden belt loops or something. It kept scrunching up and sliding around no matter how well I tied it. Ended up adding a couple of tiny safety pins to keep it in place. I added a shawl, some jewelry and a flower crown and it made my Freida Kahlo costume a hit!"
5.0,We LOVE smacking MI!
5.0,"Can't beat them for the price, works great for ATV riding"
5.0,"Great quality, breathable, and goes with everything."
5.0,Yellow is more of mustard yellow...great quality and perfect year round as the material isn‚Äôt too thick or too flimsy....just right...wondering if I should get more colorsü§î
5.0,Very cute and lightweight. Perfect for dance class. Materials has held up well and washes well
5.0,Have picky grand son but he loves this watch!
5.0,Love it! I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter and after it came I purchased a second for myself. Amazing shine and good quality.  It is different from other arched stone necklaces in the way it lays and displays on your neck. Looks like an expensive piece of jewelry
5.0,"These cardigans are super soft. I love that they have pockets and that they are versatile enough for work, play, or lounge. The pockets are a bit far back on the cardigans which is a little awkward, but it‚Äôs not too bad. They fit more snugly than I expected, but I still love them."
5.0,"I absolutely love this its super soft ,"
5.0,"Great ring, my daughter loves it"
5.0,Still really cute. Just didn't like it on my body!
5.0,"The product is really good, it looks fantastic and fits super well!"
5.0,What I expected thank you
5.0,"MY DAUGHTER LOVES THESE SHOES. EASY TO GET ON AND OFF, ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE, HAVE HELD UP - TODDLER TESTED!"
5.0,Packaged nicely. Solid pieces
5.0,"Excellent for Moana lovers. Arrived as described. The design emphasized Maui a bit more than Moana, but each item is slightly different. Its universal for any gender and age."
5.0,Arrived on time and it is good quality. It's not see through or thin.
5.0,Looked so cute with my space queen costume - perfect finishing touch!
5.0,My daughter absolutely loved this hoodie.  She slept in it Christmas night.
5.0,A little symbol of Chicago pride
5.0,Loved it looks just as I expected.
5.0,they fit perfect good quality
5.0,Perfect purse for the women who loves to be organized....it's a must have in your collection.
5.0,This eleven year old soccer playing girl has put some mileage on this headband and wears it almost every day. She love it and it has held up well.
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Purchased one each for my mother and sister for their 10-day missionary trips and they fit EVERYTHING they needed and that little bit extra that girls pack. So wonderful :) will be recommending to anyone who asks
5.0,Its beautiful!!!
5.0,"I love this sweater! It‚Äôs very cute and gives the illusion that you have layered three tops. Two people commented on it when I wore it the other day, and thought it was really neat once they figured out it was just one top.<br /><br />It‚Äôs a very lightweight sweater, not too tight, and soft and stretchy. Some of the Patty tops I own (I have a lot) have stiff/non-stretchy sweater fabric. This is one of my favorites for the nice fit and lovely material. As with most Patty tops, the body its well, but the arms a little bit tighter than I prefer - I do have to pull on them to get them to fit properly. For reference I ordered a small and I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 36‚Äù bust, 27‚Äù waist, 39‚Äù hip.<br /><br />It is casual, but looks clean and presentable and feminine. I wouldn‚Äôt put it into the dryer unless you want it to shrink - I fear it would become shorter if it shrinks, which I definitely don‚Äôt want. Otherwise, it‚Äôs held up fine in the washing machine so far."
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful! Quick delivery, looked exactly like the picture"
5.0,Meant to be worn over a top. Wore it at Fantasy Fest in Key West with nothing on underneath it. Got busted by the cops.  Still a very nice product.
5.0,Beautiful Star of David. Very comfortable and adjustable. I love it.
5.0,This purse is large enough to hold my personal items yet small enough to be every day material
5.0,Very well made. My husband loved it!
5.0,This tutu fits nice. It is just as described in the advertisement. It is fluffy and it fits very well.
5.0,"I love this scalloped top! Super cute! Lightweight, and easy to wear dressed up or down with a cute pair of leggings! I wish I had it in more colors!!!"
5.0,"The quality is much better than I expected for 9.99. The color is true, just like the site shows light pink (I have seen somebody in review posted very bright pink and I didn‚Äôt want to get the same) I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8, my usual size ‚ÄúM‚Äù, (37-29-41) and I bought the size ‚ÄúM‚Äù. The dress fits me just fine (look at the picture with leggings). But my friend also tried this dress on (photo without leggings) and it fits her much better than me, in my opinion. She is about 5'4 and wears a size ‚ÄúS‚Äù. So I would recommend to buy a size up if you want it to look like a dress, or buy your usual size and wear it like a tunic"
5.0,Really cute leotard!! I bought this for my 14 year old daughter. It fit her perfectly and looks really cute on her!!
5.0,Cute dolls.
5.0,"This is perfect to wear with all my summer shirt that have crazy cuts or backless ect. I took the foam cup things out. I don't like those so it's kind of see thoughish, but that was to be expected. I need this in black now! Fast shipping, I'd buy again."
5.0,This is my favorite shirt. If only we could all be Mary Poppins Y'all!
5.0,Love it! Looks exactly like the photo!
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter. It was just what she wanted and the fit was just as expected.
5.0,Really liked the stretch material. Item was exactly as ordered. Worth the price
5.0,"I'm a nurse- it gets super cold on my unit so I wanted something under my scrubs. Trouble is, it's July in Pennsylvania (currently 90+ degrees F) and my a/c in my car is out with no end in sight and a 20min commute. So I needed something that wouldn't get all sweaty and gross. This was perfect. The material is super soft and comfy, too. And it looks amazing. I'm 5'2 136lbs and ordered a M for a non-compressive fit."
5.0,Great Product! Feels Great!
5.0,My black dress was perfect when I wore it to church! ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,"This is a gift for my daughter. I was convinced it might look cheap but it does not. Very detailed and cute, and love the little case. Makes a great gift!"
5.0,Bought as a gift. I love the coloring. Fit really good. And has held up to washing for up to 6-months now
5.0,xmas present. I have not opened them.
5.0,Camo sunglasses for the woods are to cool
5.0,As described. Daughter loves the look b
5.0,Well my daughter is chunky she is 5 months but looks and wears size 9-12m i ordered the biggest one and will be a lil tight in her but i will make it work for her photoshoot. It is beautiful as expected i love the crown is well made
5.0,"Love this dress!! Super comfy, forgiving in every area ESPECIALLY the stomach area. Very versatile dress. Can be worn casually or can dress it up. Perfect dress for church! Love the hood and added pockets. I bought one in olive green and gray. No regrets!"
5.0,Fit great! Go by the size directory and you will be okay.
5.0,Love this! Ordered 2 more.
5.0,Very comfortable shirt.
5.0,"These are GREAT, LOVE them!"
5.0,good price and quality of the product! Our boy loves it
5.0,Stayed oily after applying
5.0,"Love all the different designs, great price"
5.0,"I find this style to be very flattering to a true hourglass figure, and it's one that will continue to flatter even on days when you may be a little bloated."
5.0,These are great little stars to add a little jazz to your jewelry projects. The PERFECT size. Very pleased. Good job!
5.0,the gloves are fine but your feel cold quickly when the temp is around 10 deg thought they be warmer good glove though
5.0,"My husband got me this for our anniversary with our kids names on it and I'm in LOVE. I have 5, so there was plenty opportunity to mess it up, but it is just beautiful."
5.0,"Love the light weight and pattern of this shirt. Casual, but cute.  I am 5'7"", 155 pounds, 34 DD, 57 years-old, an hour-glass shape with a slight new pudge around the middle. The size Medium fit well on me.  Not too large, not at all binding.  I wash on cold & hand dry, no iron needed."
5.0,"I was looking for some new nose bones, cause I needed to replace my old ones. I came across these one day while shopping on amazon. They don't have many reviews, so I wasn't sure if I was going to like them.<br /><br />I ordered them, thinking &#34;why not&#34;. When the got here, they came in a little pouch, in a sealed bag. The nose rings are great quality, the gems sit flat on the top of the stud, which is great, seeing as most studs you find, tend to have rhinestones glued to the top, that stick out too far. Very comfortable, not too long, or too short, and they stay in.<br /><br />Awesome buy, for the price! I would however recommend getting something else to put them in, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the quality of the product. Would definitely recommend if you're in the market for new nose studs! Very happy!"
5.0,Purchased this to wear with a Cinderella costume and it is perfect. Well made and adorable!
5.0,I bought it a size larger because of the review. Glad I did! I loved the look and feel of this dress. Very pretty!
5.0,I wear these all the time and they are very comfortable
5.0,"Really cute on, lightweight can be worn with anything"
5.0,Wore top first time and impressed by quality. Top is not bulky so not so warm in cold weather but I layer ie fleece vest and jacket. So all together not so bulky and very comfortable. I typically wear a M/L and I ordered the Large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù so the ‚Äúarm length‚Äù was perfect
5.0,just like the picture :-)
5.0,"This loupe is a great value. Well made, nice case, and clear/accurate optics. The extra loupe is just a bonus!"
5.0,"I've bought stupid many straps, lately. These are the first for which I felt motivated to write a positive review. I've only had the strap a few hours; should there be any long term issues, I will come back and revise this review.<br /><br />It feels substantial and trustworthy. Though I've not had it on my wrist very long it seems much more likely to last long term than most of the alternatives that I have tried.<br /><br />The most obvious unique feature is that it is reversible; it is pretty close to getting two straps for the price of one.<br /><br />It is slightly textured, which won't be to everyone's tastes, but it is pretty subtle.<br /><br />They include an additional buckle and tang. I wish the second buckle was black rather than rose gold which I cannot see myself ever using. The buckle is branded through some so so laser etching. I wish it was not there but it doesn't mar the look too badly and, as this is reversible, there  really was no where else they could have stamped their mark upon the strap without really screwing it up.<br /><br />The two downsides that I can see are 1) no quick release and 2) all the strap keepers have a nub to go into a hole of the strap. (1) is annoying but an inevitable byproduct of the straps being reversible, so the trade-off here is more than reasonable. (2) is an issue if, like me, you have large wrists. I'm using the second to last hole. The final hole doesn't make it all the way to the strap keeper, and thus there is a bulge where the nub is resting against (rather than descending into) the strap. They could have fixed this by putting the bulge on only one of the strap keepers, though I see that this would increase manufacture costs. It should be fixable with a steady hand and an exacto knife, though.<br /><br />If it were not for the limited availability right now of colour and size combinations, I'd be ordering a bunch more, today."
5.0,I am happy with glasses
5.0,"I've used these shorts for 2 years, and they're still going strong. The back pocket fits my galaxy s9 percent, and I can stuff my keys and mask in there as well. Dries out fast after a rainy run. I recommend not using the built-in as the only line of defense though. Other than that, superior quality."
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for a friend.  Can't wait to give it to her.  It's better than the pictures on line. I was concerned about ordering the gold tone, but it's really nice.  No complaints.  It arrived earlier than promised and in great condition."
5.0,I gave these to my two nieces and they loved them
5.0,"Pretty pearl bracelet,  also neat to have interchangeable jewerly pieces, ordered dragon fly"
5.0,Earrings look nice and are exactly as pictured.
5.0,Love the material of this sweater.  It's casual but you can also dress it up a bit.  My only complaint is the strings unraveled but i cut them and tied a knot at the end.  I would recommend to anyone!
5.0,"I LOVE them !!! Just buy them sis you ain‚Äôt going to regret it, fit as expected and they are the most comfortable leggings I‚Äôve ever had No üß¢."
5.0,"Heels above has been a life saver for me... I am always in heels and get so annoyed when they get stuck! Now I don't have to worry, and my shoes still look super cute with them on!"
5.0,"Lightweight, and loved all the different compartments, and the color was rich. I'd buy this again and recommend it to friends."
5.0,Everything was awesome.
5.0,"I've pretty much been living in this thing since it arrived, after I washed it of course. I have a 50 inch bust, 60 inch hips, I'm 5-3 and it comes down about mid-thigh. I got the 4x and it's very roomy, and very comfy. It wasn't overly linty like some cheap hoodies. I've washed it several times, it has not piled which is important to me. Those little lint balls are annoying, I'm glad I don't have to deal with them with these hoodies. My only complaint would be that the head hole is a little snug, I have to take my glasses off and let my hair down before I put it on. We own about six of these and we love them. Not heavyweight material but not thin, a nice medium fabric. The color is gorgeous!"
5.0,Love the soft cotton feel and amazing look of this quality spa robe. The price was a steal too.
5.0,"I love this dress and it came out of a cold water wash beautifully, just put it on a hanger to dry and it is ready to go."

5.0,My favorite mask! I love it and receive many compliments on it.
5.0,Great looking cross
5.0,Gd fabric.got a small.im 5'6 about 145
5.0,"The ""single"" key chain is a quality piece. The picture of two in the ad teases the mind that the price is for two, although the text states ""chain"". Still a Good deal"
5.0,Looks like our black and white cat - Squad Car IV.
5.0,This was a gift to my assistant. She loves it and it was really cute!
5.0,"I love these! I have the butterfly bras but these are soooooo much better! They stay on and actually stick to and cup my entire breast. Maybe because I‚Äôm not so fleshy, the butterfly bras don‚Äôt stick to my sides so if I am not wearing something form fitting, it doesn‚Äôt stay stuck like these do! Have worn same pair twice now and they are great for reuse. Will see if I can get more uses out of one purchase."
5.0,"I‚Äôve just unboxed it. I‚Äôm so pleased with it, that I‚Äôm writing this review already. Not to sound clich√©, but I have around 100 watches (across the cost spectrum). This timepiece is absolutely beautiful. It‚Äôs stunning. The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. This timepiece punches far above it weight."
5.0,great for relaxing
5.0,My Daughter loved it!
5.0,I bought these for my husband who would never pay that much for a pair of around the house slippers but after he put them on he said they are the best slipper he has ever worn fitting well and comfortable. I am going on my 2nd year with the woman's shoe and they still fit well. If you have hardwood floors and ceramic tile kitchen floors they are a must have.
5.0,Queda muy bien
5.0,Love them.  I wanted something small to wear all the time and they are perfect. Shiny and comfortable
5.0,"Whilst not hugely compartmentalized it has served as my daughter's school bag for about six(6) months and she LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it! If it makes her happy about school, then I say Great! The other day she came home and said how she go sooo many compliments from different new teachers wanting to know where she got it from. Should I tell them? It's the small things that make us happy, right?"
5.0,Great quality. I got this for my step dad for fathers day. He loves it.
5.0,Purchased this beautiful linen oversized blazer and got it today. I‚Äôm pretty excited about this because I was looking for a some blazer exactly like this. It‚Äôs very trendy. You can pair it with a crop top or tank top and then a pair of jeans and pumps. It‚Äôs linen material so it‚Äôs perfect for summer and autumn season. The blazer comes with shoulder pads and that‚Äôs the trend right now.
5.0,I get numerous compliments every time I wear it.
5.0,"I bought several hats in different colors. Feminine, comfortable, light and wide brim to keep the sun off your face."
5.0,"I never leave the house without my earrings, and I needed to find a staple pair that wouldn't tarnish. These are exactly what I wanted, and I receive compliments on them all the time! 10/10 you won't regret it."
5.0,I love the fit and feel of Judy Blue jeans! They are the most comfortable jeans out there!
5.0,"I got the mediums which are just right for me. They are form fitting without being skin tight. When I do bent over exercises there is a 1-2 inch gap around my middle. I'm 5'8"" and 140 lbs. 35 inches, 29 inches, by 39 inches.<br />It is a lower neckline so your sports bra might show, even so my bra straps peek out a bit on my back and shoulders. The fabric isn't super see through, but you might want to pair it with similar colored bras (I have a an orange bra that I pair with the pink and yellow shirts and the only thing that shows are the straps, but pairing the same shirts with my blue bra there is a slight shadow). Again these do have a lower neckline so if your doing bent rows or pushups you will want to make sure you're secure in your bra so you aren't giving anyone a free show at the gym."
5.0,Second pair for my daughter - she loves the look and can't beat the price.
5.0,Very pretty and love the fabric and colors. Soft and comfortable. Perfect length for different knots.
5.0,"I got this dress for a college ceremony and it fits really good!! It‚Äôs definitely a steal for the price, would recommend."
5.0,"Like the product and bright color.<br />If you have a small head, my case, it would be too wide<br />I need wide visor to protect my face skin so it is necessary then i worked with the back to fix it. Is not a standard hat...."
5.0,Can dress it up or down. I love graphic tees. This is a FAV. Runs small.
5.0,"So cute and comfortable. I'm 5'7&#34;, 125lbs, 3 or 26 in most jeans, and a 34B. I ordered a small and it fit beautifully!"
5.0,My son lives in these! You would think he had real glasses!! Extremely durable for everything he‚Äôs done to them too!! Only scratched up but hey he‚Äôs 9 and they aren‚Äôt real glasses! Lol
5.0,"This outfit fit Amazing, I wore this to a Bday dinner and it was a hit outfit for the night. may compliments on this outfit. I loved the look and the mini slit in front.  Also loved the wide sleeves fit like a kimono lots of space.  I'm 5""9  and like the length of this dress.  I'm about 170pounds and I order a M and it fit just right and loose of skin at same time."
5.0,The delivery was quick and  we are pleased. The skirt runs a bit small but we were aware of it.
5.0,"I normally wear XS but since S is the smallest,  I tried S.  I am 21 week pregnant and these are more confortable than my marernity pajamas although they are supposed to be regular pj since elastic waist part is so soft and not killing my baby bump.  I am sure I can still wear them after delivery.  But your panty and  breast can be seen-through."
5.0,It was a perfect fit and not as sheer as expected.
5.0,As I said it is beautiful and comfortable
5.0,Bought as a gift for my husband and he loves it! The colors and fit are perfect!
5.0,Fits good and is small enough I can wear at work with no issues
5.0,"I just put this on and it feels like it's not even on.  Looks really nice and I love it.  I would go to a box store and try on sizes, I went a size larger than my typical ring size and it is perfect."
5.0,It is just as beautiful as we expected. My wife got it for her mother and can't wait to give it to her at Christmas. Terrific value: a quality rosary at a good price. Bet you sell a lot of them.
5.0,"Received my elegant Sterling Silver SWAROVSKI Element Crystal Pendant Necklace today, beautifully packaged in the black gift box. box.  Highly impressed with the product, a perfect length and hangs nicely on my neck, with a nice chain.<br /><br />I have designer prescription sunglasses in Swarovski (paid almost $1,000) and of course I need a new prescription, and no one will allow me to reuse these frames due to the diamonds.  I keep hanging on to them, because I have been wearing them for ten years--high quality. They match perfectly with my new Key to Your Heart Necklace and have a pair of earrings which coordinate‚ÄîStunning!<br /><br />I do not like heavy necklaces or ones which turn or get twisted.  The Yoshine necklace is idea‚Äîvery comfortable, delicate, and elegant.  You can wear it daily with casual as well as dressy attire.  Very fashionable and goes with a variety of different earrings, or necklines.<br /><br />Very happy with the seller and the impressive product.

5.0,I brought this ring for my 12 yr old grandson. It's a nice ring good size stone. For anyone who likes dragon....you will like this ring. Priced just right!
5.0,"The fit well, are squat proof and super cute. I cannot see through them and trust that if I do squats at the gym, they will not tear. They are also really flattering and cute."
5.0,"I loved the style of these socks. I was expecting them to be a bit longer, like crew socks, but they‚Äôre a little higher than ankle socks, nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised about the durability of these socks. I sometimes washed them twice a week, and they kept their color and remained soft. They really seemed very well made. They are so great, I passed them down to younger boy relatives, and they are still holding up and being loved immensely. I highly, highly recommend!"
5.0,Very cute dress for my 20 month old!
5.0,Great material and great fit. Love it!
5.0,"Such a relief to find these nice looking shoes for a dementia patient.  The fit is perfect.  I ordered 1/2 size up to allow for socks and they're perfect.<br /><br />I also tried them on for comfort and they're really nice. I did remove the more ""nubby"" insole that comes in the shoe and replaced it with the extra insole that they provided (smooth.)  My loved one wouldn't tolerate anything that feels ""unusual.""<br /><br />It's been hard to find the right shoes (comfortable, no slip, correct fit) for my loved one.  These are excellent.  I'll be happy to buy another pair if these wear out."
5.0,"Do NOT get WET! Made the mistake and forgot to take them out before showering, took them out mid shower and one split in half pretty much about a quarter ways around the plug and up to the carving, pushing it out a bit. I was super sad, dried them off well with a towel and oiled them with coconut oil. In the morning you could not even see where it cracked and it closed itself back up..its been about a year since that happened and you can slightly feel the crack but does not affect wearing. Beautifully carved and nice quality wood! Will probably buy an additional pair just to have in case they sell out."
5.0,Love these and would highly recommend them!
5.0,Wife got me these bad boys because I needed new socks and they work as expected. Total 5 stars.
5.0,Prefect gift for my granddaughter
5.0,"I cannot rave enough about these headbands!<br /><br />1.  My baby has an above average sized head.  As such, it is infinitely difficult to find headbands that fit her without looking like an adorable tourniquet! These fit nice and loose on her head.  She is 11 months old and they fit perfectly with room to grow.<br /><br />2.  I can wear them - ish.  They'll fit an adult sized head.<br /><br />3.  They are just a little scratchy, but not enough where a mark has been left or my daughter hates it.  Just a little.<br /><br />4.  The colors are just as vibrant in person.<br /><br />5.  We used the red one for our family photos and it looks gorgeous.<br /><br />I highly recommend you buy these!"
5.0,My granddaughter loved her new slippers.
5.0,My favorite sunglasses! I am glad I found them here at a great price.
5.0,"I wanted it for a bar crawl. It‚Äôs a thicker weight so it was nice for being outside at night. I wish it had pockets, but overall it was a good purchase"
5.0,Great charm.  Fast shipping.
5.0,Great pj‚Äôs!
5.0,Absolutely love this wallet. Lots of space for all my cards and great material.
5.0,Got these to give to our wedding party. They loved them.
5.0,My wedding ring is a 7 and is a little loose and spins around constantly. I ordered this in a 6.5-7 and it fits absolutely perfectly. It‚Äôs so comfortable and light! I would say if you‚Äôre a true 7-7.5 I would consider sizing up. They‚Äôre not really stackable (for me at least) because they are so wide. Two together comes up to my knuckle and looks funny and isn‚Äôt the most comfortable thing as it interferes with my finger bending all the way.
5.0,"Great product, wrong size"
5.0,Like wearing nothing at all
5.0,"I wear these when I ride my horse & they haven't ripped yet & they aren't scratchy, must have for an equestrian."
5.0,"I have let to give this gift, but it looks very pretty (the card sentiment and necklace combination is a great idea). I'll know more when my friend receives it."
5.0,This scarf was perfect also.  Wore it yesterday.  Very nice.
5.0,"Looks great on my son foot. Comfortable,durable good looking shoe. My son loves this boot.  Cheaper on Amazon than in the store which is great."
5.0,"This fits perfectly. I'm 6ft tall and 300lbs. It's light weight and extremely breathable. Only thing is, it outlines my beautiful nips, lol! All good though. I don't mind at all."
5.0,"Bought this shirt as a gift last minute and it arrived quickly and in time! I also really liked the material of the shirt, it was soft and not stiff like some cotton t-shirts can be. All in all I'm satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,"These are great running joggers the quality is awesome and they feel very good they also look very nice and stylish, I love these, I would definitely purchase again."
5.0,Love being able to interchange the straps on my Timex to match different outfits. Nice colors.
5.0,Very cute apron for keeping your clothes clean while cooking in the kitchen.  Full apron that will cover most of your front against any spillage or splattering.  Handy pockets to keep kitchen tools or recipes.  Ties easily and unties quickly for easy removal. Lightweight so it doesn't feel heavy and weigh you down.
5.0,"these are so hip, i am  incredibly happy with this buy. i thought they might be too big, but they were just right for an oversize shade, and i have a small face"
5.0,That it has no pockets

5.0,Love this mask! Comfortable and light and safe!
5.0,I love the care that was taken in the making of this piece it came and was larger than I was expecting thank you for having it The quality of the piece
5.0,"I like everything about this.  Looked at leather, which I usually prefer, but couldn't pass up this great price.  It looks great, like it's more expensive.  I'm using it mostly for travel, and I usually attend social functions where a regular purse won't do.  The detachable wrist strap makes it more versatile, so I can use it as a wallet or wristlet clutch.  It holds my cell, cards, cash, change and passport with room to spare while maintaining the slim lines.  No unpleasant odor, zippers work well, and ease of opening and removing items."
5.0,"Love the Beauty & Comfort of this Dresses. LOVE wearing it, Beautiful"
5.0,I bought this belt from the Hot Topic at Stoneridge shopping center and it's perfect! I use it with my quiver for archery because its easy to put on and take off quickly. i also use it just to keep my pants up haha. well made belt and perfect!
5.0,Love this top! Feels light and airy. Roomy and flown so can be worn tucked in or out. Very happy with this!
5.0,Material is nice should have ordered a small
5.0,These were just what I was looking for. My niece loves crazy socks. All sizes and colors. Even mismatched! Her party was Harry Potter themed this year and they were just wonderful. Of course she LOVES them :) They were just what I was expecting too. The fabric was nice and the length was good for her (she is 12 now).
5.0,Lightweight shirt with really pretty design in the back
5.0,"Gave these to my granddaughters and they loved them, nice size and weight"
5.0,One of the best ties I own!
5.0,You can dress this up a bit or keep it comfy. Great purchase!
5.0,"Caught if for my younger daughter bc he wears a girls 16-18, and it was too large, so I ended up giving to my older daughter, and she loves. If it fit me, I'd werar it--too cute!"
5.0,Son loved it for his bday waterpark surprise!
5.0,The price is a little high for a hat! But I love it.
5.0,Love this dress. So stylish and flows well. It doesn‚Äôt hide your figure but compliments it. I hope they decide to make it in other colors.
5.0,Fits well I received many complements
5.0,"I love these shirts I wear them all the time as undershirts which adds more coverage to the hip line.  I always wear these under my work clothes, as everyday wear and for working out."
5.0,Can hardly tell it is not the strap it came with. I like that it had two bands to hold back the excess strap.
5.0,"This is a beautiful scarf. I included a close up picture of the scarf detail which is gorgeous. It looks very delicate and expensive in opinion. The fabric is very soft and thin but thick enough to give you the hint of warmth you may need in a chilly room. I got the turquoise color which is really vibrant and exactly as pictured. Although the scarf is pictured as an actual scarf, it is long enough and large enough to worn as a shawl. I plan to use it as a shawl for one of my fancier dresses.<br /><br />The great thing about this scarf is that while I do consider it very nice and fancy, you can still wear it casually. I think it looks great with jeans and a plain top. It's like the little something extra you're missing with an outfit. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My opinions are my own and it's a super beautiful piece to have. I hope this was helpful."
5.0,The shorts fit my proportions well and it's the perfect length. The material does not ride up. I wear these shorts to lift weights in.
5.0,Replacements fit perfectly into frames. Lenses seem a little darker
5.0,Cute and keeps sweat of face
5.0,Love these mesh adjustable belts.  Great for jeans & cargo shorts.
5.0,Have helped me with veins in both legs and corrected a problem on my big toe that was scheduled for surgery. Still have not needed the surgery 2 years later.
5.0,My skin is super sensitive and can't do anything other than titanium. Color is great and the gem is staying in place. Haven't lost the top ball and seems to be staying in place.
5.0,Very nice dress shirt. Soft and comfortable. High quality material. Will buy more.
5.0,"I get a lot of compliments on this dress, comfortable and flows nicely. Quick shipping, runs big, i am 5'9&#34; and 198lbs. Its somewhat large in the waist, but a skinny belt takes care of it. LOVE IT!!"
5.0,"So far, so good with these earrings. Great quality, secure clasp. They look expensive, beautiful and dress up my busy/boring work attire. Recommended to fam and friends. Will probably buy an extra pair or two - can‚Äôt beat the price!"
5.0,"Lovely, look expensive"
5.0,Perferct fit looked great will be buying more from seller. Thanks Carls.
5.0,I ordered these for my daughter who is a huge BTS and she absolutely loved them.
5.0,"Easy to use. As a small-headed woman (16-1/4&#34;), hats would never fit properly. This works well for me. I would buy again."
5.0,"I needed a watch band for my vintage Casio 300 meter digital dive watch, model DW-340.  This one fit the relatively hard to find 19 mm lug with and looks like it was made for the watch.  It look great!  The soft compound is very comfortable and I like that it has a metal, rather than plastic buckle.  If your looking for a diver style band for 19 mm lug watch, this is a good choice at a very good price.  The band is log so it can go around a wet suit if needed.  Of course nobody dives with watches anymore.  They all use dive computers, but this is a dive watch and I want it to look the part."
5.0,"Got for my young daughter, she loved it. It was also easy to program."
5.0,This looks exactly like the picture and is made of quality material
5.0,Allows you to be able to breathe and avoids harassment by stores and other sheep who believe a mask is some sort of protection against a super deadly virus!
5.0,Very good quality and fast service
5.0,I love it! So cute and simple! Couldn't even wait till Christmas to give it to my boyfriend. We've been wearing them everyday and night. It's just perfect

5.0,Stunning!!
5.0,GROYPER üê∏
5.0,necklace is exactly as described and is perfectly made. It came in by estimated delivery date.
5.0,"After one night of wearing these socks, my heels were so much softer.  (I didn't even have to put on any lotion beforehand).  I started wearing them to bed, during the summer.  The open toe allowed my feet to breathe so I didn't end up kicking them off during the night.  Great socks!"
5.0,"Great for the value. I absolutely love sunnies! I spend way too much money on designer ones. I‚Äôll start buying ones from Amazon from now on. These don‚Äôt break the bank, look cheap and they don‚Äôt hurt my ears like the expensive ones!"
5.0,Much larger than expected and I was okay with that! Pretty and shiny! I havent worn it as it will be a gift for someone else but it seems nice quality
5.0,"Great suit! I love that the pads are sewn in so no more struggling to put those annoying pads in every time you wash it! All other suits I‚Äôve tried since having kids make my post baby boobs look sad and flat, but not this one! Great support and makes them look as good as they did before my kids sucked the life out of them! Will be buying more colors for sure! And the bottoms even fit. Amazing buy."
5.0,Comfortable and good for wide feet.
5.0,Good overall quality.
5.0,"This summer dress is very cute. The material is very soft and pretty comfortable to wear. It‚Äôs loosely designed, recommend to buy the size smaller than usual. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it during the summer. Plus the material is not see through at all which is great. I bought the black color, but I think the flower one might be better. I am thinking to buy another flower one."
5.0,I loved it... thanks!!!
5.0,"Grand Seiko watches can be stainless steel or titanium. Their ""driver's"" series are titanium, but many other Grand Seiko models are stainless steel cased with Grand Seiko‚Äôs signature Zaratsu-polished finish... Like this one. It's an amazing watch; I absolutely love it."
5.0,It is a unique and beautiful collection of colors and bead/pearl shapes.  It always gets positive comments.
5.0,"I love these shoes!  I reluctantly purchased the Midnight Blue, because I really wanted black, which was sold out.  But, these look black to me!  I wanted them for cycling because I don't like to ride in sneakers (it's too easy for the foot to slide off the pedal.............So I wanted a sandal with a substantial definition in the sole between the arch and the heel.  This is perfect!  Not only does it have a rubber sole but it also has that slight definition to which I was referring, which PREVENTS the foot from sliding off the pedal.  In sneakers, my feet get too hot (considering the Florida heat and humidity), therefore, sandals are essential for my outdoor activities..  Additionally, each of the ""Velcro"" straps is totally adjustable to enable a perfect fit!  Love these, and will definitely order another pair.  Midnight blue truly appears black, which is what I wanted!  I placed the shoe against black shorts, black pants, and a black towel... And these sandals still appear black...although the black is sold out.  If you prefer a substantial ""arch,"" which I do, this is the perfect pair of shoes and worth every penny of the $45.  Thank you Amazon for carrying them."

5.0,Prefer these backs over the normal ones
5.0,"Update:<br />The seller reached out and offered a replacement of a smaller size and I‚Äôm in love (after my first wash)!!!! Beautiful pair of leggings, fits like a glove, will be buying in more colors for sure!<br /><br />Earlier Review:<br />I bought a pair of these leggings. The material itself is nice and comfy. They fit good when I tried it when it was delivered, once washed, it‚Äôs almost a size loose - it expanded a great deal. Had I known this before, I would have just ordered a smaller size. I‚Äôve washed it already and my conscience isn‚Äôt allowing me to return it. I guess it‚Äôs just wasted money at this point because the expanded pants create an unpleasant Camel toe (since I keep trying to put it up because it‚Äôs loose) and I wouldn‚Äôt even allow to be caught dead with that!!"
5.0,Girls took them to the beach
5.0,Exactly what i wanted and the colors arr true to pictures.
5.0,I loved these pants and got so many complainants but probably could of gone with a small
5.0,"I'm shorter (5'3"") hover around size 10-12 and the Small fit great! Wasn't potato sack-ish. Fits great and the extra material is really cute. I bought a few different ones for our cruise and this one is a keeper. Gotta love free returns just in case! For $6 you really cannot beat it."
5.0,Just what I was looking for for my 11yr old son. He likes it and it‚Äôs secure with the zipper enclosure where the paper bills go.
5.0,Very nice. Love them. If you order them you won't be disappointed.
5.0,"Are you kidding me? This is an EXTREMELY elegant watch at an unheard of price! The black leather band provides a nice contrast to the watch face, though I opted for a different black leather band with white stitching that better fit my 6.5 inch wrist. It's hard to beat the elegance of this watch at the unbeatable price!"
5.0,Beautiful Shirt. I love it!!
5.0,This dress is just like the picture.

5.0,My son doesn‚Äôt like banded shorts or pants but he has to wear khaki shorts for work. These are perfect!  He loves the drawstring feature and he doesn‚Äôt have to wear a belt.
5.0,"Favorite bathing suit. Tried it on at Macy's and bought it on Amazon because more color selections. SO freaking comfortable not even funny. Normally bathing suits dig into me, not sure if that's just me, or feel awkward. This feels like I am wearing nothing. Just enough padding that you have it, not enough where you feel like you're awkwardly lying about your bust size or trying to fit into excess padding. Very cute back, makes great for photos. Green matches with my floral bottoms. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,"I ordered these sometime back in the Summer and I was afraid they would not be as pretty as they looked on the site....Best purchase I have made for myself. I've been hiding them from my oldest daughter but I will get her a pair for Xmas. They are gorgeous and a day never goes by when all I get is compliments  about them and how they look. Thanks again Amazon, 1 happy shopper here and now you will have my family ordering too...Judy M"
5.0,Quality was better than expected.  Packaging was amazing and product was delivered on time.  Will definitely purchase their products again!
5.0,love this dress!! fit perfect and true to size
5.0,Great fitting sock. A<br />Little hard to get on but once in very comfortable.
5.0,"Gevril is a small Swiss watchmaker and their products are often not well-known.  In fact, when I had a couple of links removed, my watch repairer told me he had never seen a Gevril in 21 years of doing business. However, this is a great watch that exudes class and sophistication.  The little touches differentiate this watch from its competitors; the ruffles on the side of the watch case; the Roman numerals on the dial; the watch back (made out of an actual 2 Swiss Franc piece), and the packaging, which was absolutely superior. -It came in its own beautiful wooden box, which you don't see on other luxury watches costing thousands of dollars.  In summary, this is a great buy at a modest price for a luxury watch.  I highly recommend!"
5.0,It's the perfect tiny size I was looking for to wear with other necklaces.
5.0,Really cute. Such a pretty color and light and breezy for summer
5.0,After reading the reviews I ordered my daughter a size larger and it is a perfect fit. She typically wears a medium so I ordered a large. She loves it and it looks great!
5.0,I am always nervous about purchasing sunglasses online because I have the largest head on earth...But these fit great!  I really wish that there were more styles with the same exact measurements.
5.0,"Sizing error on my part, but very cute dress.  Would buy again."
5.0,These boots are great for icy/snowy sidewalks and parking lots.  Not an insulated boot but they look amazing on my wife and she loves them. Much nicer/more attractive than we thought they would be. Good traction/tread on heel and forefoot. Would definitely purchase again.
5.0,I love this necklace! I have received so many compliments on it. It‚Äôs simple yet so perfect
5.0,Perfect for a Respiratory Therapist on their feet during 12 hour shifts. Super comfortable and really cute.
5.0,"What a great purchase! I love the deep, rich color (wine) and the fit is ideal. I am between sizes and went up; this fits loosely (as I wanted) and flows in a very flattering way. The v-neck, too, is very slimming but not too low-cut for large-chested women. I bought this, initially, in black. Loved it so much I bought the wine-colored one as well!"
5.0,"Product received, good packaging, good quality, wear on the body is also very comfortable, fabric is also very good, value for money! Recommended friends to buy!"
5.0,Great quality piece for prom.  My daughter loved it.
5.0,This is a great shirt that fits well. The graphics of an astronaut are very colorful and look great. Highly recommend.
5.0,S√∫per bueno el producto
5.0,"Purchased a pair of glasses for Hubby and was such a great deal, bought two. Turned out to be an awesome look and great for my active man."
5.0,Got for my 90 yr old mom. She likes it. Fit great.
5.0,Tight on my 34&#34; waist
5.0,Awesome love how it feels
5.0,"Very cute, I'm sure my Granddaughter will love it."
5.0,Daughter liked it. So far its holding up. She takes it to gym. Decent size.
5.0,"The colors are as pictured, and the ease of install is just as described in other reviews. This is a great choice if you're looking for a strap, and especially if you need one a bit bigger than what comes with the watch."
5.0,Fit great. Nice addition to my work attire.
5.0,"Cute and comfy. I have a mid drift adidas sweatshirt to go with it. Fabulous outfit with adidas sneakers!!! Girl Bye, lol!"
5.0,I wore my new dress today for the first time accessorized with a scare and black tights and black shoes. I received many compliments. I really like the way it fits. It is very comfortable and the fabric is very soft. The perfect weight.
5.0,Thank you for showing the sizing in mm. I checked the size of my prescription glasses so I knew they would cover all of them. Luckily I have frameless glasses so these look great. Had 2 other kinds of night glasses with frames around them and they didn‚Äôt fit well over my glasses and looked horrendous. And the clip that opens to easily put them on. You ROCK!  Very nice cloth and little case they go in. I have a pair for each vehicle. I drive one way at night 5 days a week and this makes driving sooo much better. Cutting the glare on all the lights  makes it easier to see animals and people darting out into the roadway. And lightens the eye strain of all the crazy lights and brights people drive and forget they have on. Now I‚Äôm not embarrassed to be seen in them vs the other framed pairs I have not made to go over glasses. Even had a compliment on them first night I wore them. And the pricing is excellent.
5.0,This is adorable! I love Springer spaniels!
5.0,Great washed up beautifully
5.0,They are a great fit and so comfortable‚Äî wore them all day the first day and no problems
5.0,Quality hat.
5.0,"It's a beautiful pendant. With good quality. Also they sent it in a wonderful gift box, very cute. I gifted this to my girlfriend and she love's it"
5.0,Bought this ring as a replacement for my original wedding band and it is perfect!
5.0,"Looks great with my outfits, will only buy wratchet style belts like this from here on out"
5.0,"I got this as a gift, and he loved wearing it to the gym since it has zipper pockets, which keeps his things from falling out during or after a workout."
5.0,"Worn by a 10 y.o. who put it on Christmas morning and will barely take it off to be washed, he loves it so. It washes up great and looks brand new each and every time.  Really pleased with this purchase."
5.0,This top is so soft and pretty good quality.
5.0,Bought this watch along with another as a birthday and anniversary gift for my husband and I love them both! This matches my husbands wedding band and my favorite color is blue! Love it!
5.0,I got SOOOO many compliments on this outfit!!! After reading reviews... I decided to size up.  I normally wear a LARGE (I am 5'4 190lbs)... But I ended up purchasing an XL and I'm glad I did.  I am top & bottom heavy but my waist is on the smaller side.  This is the perfect outfit for an hourglass figure.
5.0,Well made suit. Fit me perfectly!
5.0,"Great leggings, waist is perfect! Color is also great."
5.0,Perfect for my use.
5.0,Absolutely love this bag.  It is leather except for straps.  Very well made and well worth the price
5.0,"These dresses are beautiful! My daughters loved them and stole the show at their concert! I am super pleased and will buy other colors if I need to. I did buy crinoline to go under the dresses but ended up not using it because I thought it would be uncomfortable. However, I do recommend a crinoline if you want a princess ball gown look."
5.0,I LOVE this dress and get so many compliments on it!
5.0,Doing a trip to the Big Island. Needed a larger but light bag. This bag is great for the price. Material looks sturdy looks great. It has a semi rigid backing (light cardboard like) which makes it stand up better.  Not a lot of compartments but allows for more storage. There is one pocket I will use for my iPad Pro with a sleeve. Rain cover is stored on a zipper slot at the bottom of the bag which also cushions the bottom.  I will see how it will hold up after a week of outdoor activities.
5.0,"nice ring, as advertised  :)  would recommend it to anyone"
5.0,very thick
5.0,"I am very happy with these socks. As a teacher, I almost always wear flat shoes, alternating between loafers, boat shoes, and driving moccasins, so I am always looking for great no show socks. It is a challenge to find the perfect pair! Some are too small and slide off my feet; others are too large and show too much outside the shoe. Some are 100% cotton and end up being too casual looking, while some are made of a rayon or silk blend that leave blisters on my feet at the end of the day. I'm not completely confident that the Spikerking socks are the perfect socks for me yet (I've only had them a couple weeks), but so far they are just about the best I've tried. They cover just enough of my foot that I'm confident they will not slip off in the middle of the day, but not too much that they show outside of my shoe. The colors are adorable and give me a little bit of fun instead of the same old taupe or black. My one concern is that they seem a little thinner than socks of other brands that I have tried, so I am not sure how they will hold up after repeated washings. If it was possible. I would likely give them a 4.5 out of 5 star rating because of the thinness. I love the four strips of non-slip &#34;glue&#34; on the heel that keep the sock on my foot - I was worried that would be uncomfortable, but it grips just enough and I don't even notice it once the socks are on my feet. In the pictures you can see how these compare to two other brands I've tried in the past - Keds & Sheec. I hated the Keds ones - they were too small and kept slipping off my feet. I like the Sheec ones, but they show a little too much outside the shoe at times. These ones are just in between and I love that about them. These are also more affordable than both of those other brands (at least when I purchased them they were). I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these socks. While I received them at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, I will likely be buying more at full price in other colors!"
5.0,"Nice, colorful."
5.0,Love! Cool looking cuff bracelet.
5.0,"The quality of the shirt material is very nice and durable. The color is very vibrant. Doesn‚Äôt hang like most tshirts, it has a super nice cut. Love it!"
5.0,I love the way these fit enough stretch and very contouring to the body and super comfortable
5.0,Exactly what I needed and shipping was fast.
5.0,Good strap
5.0,Exactly what I wanted! Love my hat! :)
5.0,These are perfect size and ALL great quality. I love them!! I'm actually ordering more.
5.0,Grandson loved it. Graphics are great & material is soft and sturdy.
5.0,Es lo q ordene buen material
5.0,"Enjoying them, last pair I will have to buy"
5.0,"I bought this bag from the Michael Kors store in the mall on sale for much less. This is a great bag. The blue is beautiful and the silver hardware is sturdy. It holds a large Kate Spade wallet, Samsung Galaxy 6 cell phone, lipstick and keys. If your wallet is small it will hold more. It's a versatile style bag; you will want more than one. Amazon has colours you won't find in the store."
5.0,"Never before have I been excited about a wallet. The Coach wallet my girlfriend bought me five years ago finally busted and I needed a replacement. Something small but still functional. The Andar fit the bill. The first day I had it, it felt too small, but the leather has since stretched just enough to carry all my essentials. It seems to be high quality and hopefully it will be another five years until I need a new wallet. Definitely recommend."
5.0,Perfect! Thanks
5.0,Amazing wallet!!!! Super amazing price for it and so awesome. Exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful.
5.0,I find these masks to be of high quality and they fit my face well.  The nose bridge is adjustable in order to get a snug fit which is exactly what you want!  If the material is made the way they say it is then this would be my favorite mask thus far.
5.0,"Great product, very soft, does not bother fingers, looks cool and beautiful."
5.0,So cute on my daughter
5.0,the details on this watch is just fabulous.  way better than expected.  very pleased.
5.0,Beautiful perfect fit
5.0,Good for what they were needed for
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my 20 y.o son. Very appropriate for the occasion.  He is not a jewelry person per se..but this has a little edge. Wording is not large, but present. Cuff looks sharp on...not shiny.<br />Would look great dressed up or down. Nice price."
5.0,I will buy more from this company
5.0,work as described
5.0,Fit as expected. Good quality!  Perfect!
5.0,Pretty color just like the picture but you might wanna size up like 2 times runs small
5.0,"These are perfect for my toddler! Ordered 5-6 and they don't run small. I have also bought her Nikes, Asics, Under Armour, Twinkle Toes and New Balance shoes and the sizing is all pretty much the same(I have a shoe problem). She's a size 5 right now and she will grow into them for summer."
5.0,Love it. I like the pearl face and the black numbers.
5.0,It's a great wallet the detail is really nice and my son loves it.
5.0,"Just what I needed on a very short notice.  Needed to attend / participate in a military honor Mission, and received this in advance of my actual need."
5.0,A barbecue
5.0,Super cute and colorful dress! My daughter is a size 8 so we got her a size medium and it fit perfectly. Really good quality and the fact that it comes with the headband a total plus!
5.0,"Bought these socks to go skiing in, and living in FL, we don't have any warm gear. I was hoping these would do the job.  And did they.  Weather was anywhere between 10-35 degrees skiing and snowmobiling and I never had or felt any cold on my feet at any point.  Very soft, comfortable and did their job.  Thanks."
5.0,My granddaughter looked so cute in her Thanksgiving outfit
5.0,"Fast seller, great for boys"
5.0,"Even though this is a bit too large (and I wear a large) and a bit too thin, I really love this top."
5.0,Bought as a gift for my uncle and it is PERFECT. Bought with guitar belt buckle and they go perfect together.
5.0,Perfect for Halloween. (and they added a gift)
5.0,Very good watchband.  I'm sure it will outlast the watch.
5.0,I really like these earrings. They are comfortable because they are lite weight. They are so shiny that they almost look white
5.0,"2nd pair of Croc flip flops-very comfortable-easy to walk in (touring islands, walking on beaches), nice neutral color. May purchase another pair!"
5.0,They were exactly what was needed
5.0,Love the color and comfort. Got these for a couple of acoustics
5.0,Sturdy and yet feminine
5.0,"I'm a long distance runner and have been dealing with some lower leg pain/issues for the past few months. I've bought a few different products from Aegend and have been really happy with them so I thought I'd give the compression socks a shot and they did not disappoint. They look and feel great and have a perfect fit. They are tight enough to give me relief from pain when running but not so tight as to restrict blood circulation, which is an issue with some similar products. Also, you seriously can't beat the price! Love em!"
5.0,"Beautiful, simple yet unique looking ring. Love the two tones, and it fits well. Would definitely recommend, especially for such a great price."
5.0,Great fit. High quality. Recommended seller.
5.0,Great Keychain.  Quality is great and details are incredible.
5.0,"Product as described, good quality."
5.0,Great wild rag - well made - color matched on line picture
5.0,"I have never gotten so many compliments on a purse before! Everyone asks me where I got this! The only thing I was sad about was that the little strap that the buckle gets tucked under so it doesn't pop out, broke a few days after I got it but that could have very well been my fault. Love this purse so much though. Very well made and looks exactly like the picture!"
5.0,Perfect fit and I like the colors.
5.0,Don't let the large range in size scare you. It fits my 9 year old (kid size 10) and it also fits comfortably on me (adult 4/6). The child will definitely need to wear something under it (it's a tutu not a skirt). Was perfect for what we needed.<br />The feathers in the pic are part of her Halloween costume. It falls near the knees. Good quality. Elastic waist stretches enough that she can use it for years.
5.0,Love me my llamas
5.0,Love them! they fit great look great and really wash well. Keeps their shape all day long.
5.0,They fit to size
5.0,Nice product. Looks like suede leather. It‚Äôs soft. I like it.
5.0,A very wonderful and excellent product
5.0,"I ordered this in XL and fits more like a M or L.  Size up one or two sizes (better to go larger than a tight fitting sweatshirt).  Otherwise, great quality, comfy and washes well.  Love the pockets. Super cute."
5.0,Love these! So cute and have held up great!
5.0,10üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå fit really nice
5.0,"Been using a week, works great and best price I could find on this type of band"
5.0,Awesome belt buckle!  Holds very well and has a great hidden compartment for your ball marker!
5.0,Perfect for my daughters wedding.
5.0,I love that I have received so many positive comments when wearing my pendant. It's beautiful and fully charged with amazing energy
5.0,Made of that jersey material so it's very breathable and feels cool on the skin. Very comfortable especially if other masks hurt your ears. I wear mine around my neck and barely notice until I need to pull it up for use.  Hopefully we get more patterns soon but I love it!
5.0,I love this swimsuit! I usually end up throwing a t shirt on over my swimsuit but not with this one it's coverage is great!!
5.0,"I purchased this t-shirt as a gift for my grandson, who is a Corvette fan.  He loves it!"
5.0,I am about 5'8&#34; and 175lbs. I would say I wear an L/XL.  So to be on the safe side I ordered an XL.  I am glad I did.  I like the flow of the shirt.  It looks great with leggings and I love the beige color.  The neckline does have a slight V.  It is very appropriate for work (I work in an office environment) and the fabric was not see through.  All in all I was very happy with this purchase.
5.0,I absolutely lived this book. An elf on the shelf for those of us that will not move it every day.
5.0,Lunch with my kids
5.0,"Wow! These are so soft and comfortable! I previously bought HUE, and liked those socks, but these are WAY better: socks are a tiny bit more thick and the strap is made of the sock material but serged, so they should last a while."
5.0,"Very very comfortable!! Fits great, looks great, washes nicely. Sleeves can be worn down or slightly rolled up and buttoned. Highly recommend this scrub top!"
5.0,It does not fall apart!
5.0,Got this for my son when the standard one broke. Easy to put on and holds up well. He loves it
5.0,It's a mouse pad. I did have one strange issue that went away; my mouse (Razer Ouroboros) would not track on this pad at all. After fiddling with some re-calibration settings it started to work. Specifically...when I decreased the LED brightness on the mouse it immediately started to work. I turned the LED back up and it still worked.
5.0,Socks were adorable and fit well
5.0,"Love the seller, love the scarves - this was not my first purchase. This one, in particular, is perfect for summer. Lightweight and super pretty!"
5.0,This got so many compliments . It's beautiful and looks expensive
5.0,very comfortable with the adjustable ear links.
5.0,support under hernia brace.  great roduct...bought more
5.0,Love these rings worth the money !:)
5.0,Great buy very comfy
5.0,great classes. clear. comfortable and the bifocal placement works really well.
5.0,This is such a cute and well made shirt. I can tell it will hold up over time.
5.0,Such a cute dress!!!
5.0,"He wears them often, I like to watch him when he does.  Soft, comfortable, fun colors, nice &quot;packaging&quot; if you know what I mean."
5.0,"Where I am currently at, I have to walk over rocks (NOT gravel) to get to the showers. These flip-flops have held up very well. They retain some water towards the toe, but they dry very fast. They are a little large on my feet, but are still comfortable. Good purchase."
5.0,Beautiful and elegant!
5.0,It was exactly what we wanted!
5.0,"This shirt fit perfectly, actual size that they said. Have ordered other clothing online,but because where its made, the size they say, isn't accurate. Usually cut WAYYYY TOOO SMALLL. not this shirt though,& material is super soft üòä"
5.0,Good and durable
5.0,"I have been told for some time that I need to wear compression socks for my chronic venous stasis but I can't find any that I can put on without working up a sweat.  These are perfect!!  I was nervous to believe the commercials at first, but I am a believer now!!  They are still compression socks, so obviously there is a little work involved in putting them on... but I will be wearing them daily now!"
5.0,Love Nike this fits true to size very flattering! I normally wear an xs and I ordered an xs.
5.0,Great product! Will buy from this seller again.
5.0,"I love it as my ""bag"" in addition to my carry on suitcase.  It fits over the extending handle and the color matches my other luggage perfectly.  It has plenty of room to carry my purse as well as snacks when I fly.  I would recommend it highly."
5.0,"A lovely piece of metal jewelry which; even while ever so small, packs a bling factor way-way beyond its weight. Love it!!!"
5.0,"Soft, warm material. Slightly stretchy but not clingy, very comfortable. Colors stay in the wash and don't bleed on whites, and dries without wrinkles when hung out to dry. Fantastic! Love this dress."
5.0,Works very well-temporary fix for loose crowns.
5.0,Very nice looking bracelet for females
5.0,I really love the caps. Very good head coverings. Very fashionable. Pretty colors
5.0,Love it.  Nice size
5.0,It has been -4  here in Montana and my husband has been wearing them to shovel. He said they are fabulous!!
5.0,This is my 4th wikiwiki umbrella. Always impressed with the quality at such a great price. The umbrellas are easy to assemble and they have held up to the elements well.
5.0,"I really love these! I do alot of handling packages and I needed them to be touchscreen compatible.  The construction is great, although the rubber is a bit thick on the back and a bit much over the thumbnail area.  After a week and a wash, they still look great! The touch is a bit finicky but they do the job.  We're heading into the rainy cold season so I'm hopeful these last!"
5.0,"A little context first. I‚Äôm an older guy who has owned numerous watches in his lifetime. My preference over the years has been more established brands that I know will work - Seiko, Citizen, Invicta, Elgin. Typically, I tend towards chronograph watches because I like the functionality.  Because of Amazon‚Äôs exceptional return policy, I find I can explore other brands that I find attractive And reasonably priced. Benyar is one of those brands. I‚Äôm impressed!  Not only do they look good, but they work. This is my third Benyar."
5.0,This shirt was perfect after having a complete shoulder replacement.  The material is light weight and soft. I highly recommend it.
5.0,Skinny silk...now let your imagination run wild....
5.0,grand daughter loved it!
5.0,Like the different colors
5.0,"this is very easy to use,"
5.0,"The fact that this item has a drawstring in the back eliminates my biggest concern that the mask will fall off while I'm using it. I don't have a very defined nose, so I can't rely on that to hold my mask in place. The drawstring in the back makes it a reliable and practical face covering for all uses. Also, the logo design and name make it pretty darn stylish as well."
5.0,It is really good and shinny. I love it!
5.0,"Haha they are the best... It was definitely was worth the price, nice quality and it fits almost all shoe sizes too! We got a good laugh out of them! They look exactly like the picture given."
5.0,"Ok so I originally thought ‚Äúno way can a costume you buy on Amazon be high quality‚Äù. Boy was I wrong. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù but I have wide hips and a kangaroo pouch belly (I wear a size 10-12) so I got the large just to be safe. I figured it‚Äôs practically pajamas so who cares if it‚Äôs a little big? Well the large was a full 12‚Äù past my feet and the cr0tch hangs well below my own but it didn‚Äôt look weird being too big. The tail being below my butt actually looked better in my opinion. More cow-like. So my mom sews and comes from a family of seamstresses so I brought it to her to just cut the excess off and hem the bottom. When I tell you, she was SO IMPRESSED with the quality of this costume. I had originally told her the costume cost less because I didn‚Äôt want her to be mad I spent this much on cow pajamas‚Ä¶ but she told me ‚Äúthis thing is sewn like Fort Knox.  The zippers alone are worth what you paid for it!‚Äù I eventually told her the truth of what I paid and EVEN THEN she was like ‚Äústill‚Ä¶ that is a great deal‚Äù. She loved the smaller details, the zippers, the fact that there‚Äôs two sets of pockets, that one set zippers and one set container udders‚Ä¶ I think I may actually buy my 67 year old mother a cow costume!!!! ‚Ä¶So she cut the excess off the legs and instead of hemming the bottom she actually tapered the legs inward so they fit more like skinny jeans than straight leg. This costume genuinely deserves a great review. Worth the cost for sure."
5.0,"Love these, very light weight like I have no glasses on at all."
5.0,Used for sleeping
5.0,Nice fit and they look great.
5.0,Love the variety of colors and the length. Perfect for making jewelry.
5.0,Great quality for a vey good price. I‚Äôm thrilled with the purchase. It takes abuse from<br />My 2 year old pulling on it too
5.0,"A true Whovian would love this watch!! It's the perfect size for a man. I bought this for my boyfriend, but I have to admit that I am completely jealous that it's not mine! I love all of the features ascetically, but since it's a gift I won't know about its functionality for a while. It can be worn as a wristwatch or a pocket watch, which is so awesome! The details are gorgeous! The display box is cool! Comes with serial number and collectors information. It's definitely a special watch. If he doesn't love it as much as me then I'm totally taking it back. Lol"
5.0,"Love these shirts, soft and confortable, but still maintains a professional look.  Fit was good, sleeves and midsection did not show issues.  Very happy."
5.0,"This head wrap keeps my hair really well, while I sleep. It's a fantastic alternative to a bonnet and the satin lining helps to preserve my hair when straitened. It also helps to maintain my style. I love it!"
5.0,"very lightweight , if you want a heavy band Id go with something else.  but this is super secure and you barely feel it on"
5.0,"I have bought an eBay before and it was my favorite purse. After searching and actually buying two other bags that didn't do the trick - I came back to Amazon and bought this eBay. The depth is just right. There are LOTS of pockets (secure I might add), and it can be cross body or not. Plus it is washable! The ads  don't say that - but I always wash mine and they are fine."
5.0,"Nice float top, soft fabric not clingy"
5.0,"I love IBKUL. This color is gorgeous, it‚Äôs a little bit more red then expected, but it‚Äôs still wonderful."
5.0,"I love these pants.  They are perfect for Spring,  the breach,  or just packing light.  I plan to buy a mother pair or two."
5.0,Came out perfect!
5.0,Absolutly stunning.  Metal is nice and sturdy.  Not too thick or thin. Looks amazing!
5.0,"does the job, I like the colors very cute"
5.0,"I love it! I ordered a Medium for a little oversized fit, TTS. Will be cute with biker shirts, I did a front tuck with Jean shorts. It‚Äôs not a normal cotton tshirt material but it a super soft and comfy! Get it!"
5.0,"I ordered the blue, grey, and black to match my shorts and long pants now I have the entire set. The material is soft but on the silky side. The sleeves were a little short, ,but the pants fit perfectly. I love the outfit."
5.0,Good quality.  Fits just right.
5.0,"I love this fit and flare dress.  It's the perfect waist height and skirt length.  The pattern is exactly as pictured.  One of the pockets was too small for my hand to slide in without folding my pinky and thumb in, but that doesn't bother me enough to take a star off of the review.  This dress was well worth the price, and I would buy it again!"
5.0,"Shirt was good quality. Was given as a birthday gift, which the recipient loved."
5.0,"so many compliments. Also I'm a prep chef, wore theses all day at work and feet feel just fine. Love them!! great colors and embroidery work!"
5.0,My NP of the family loves these!
5.0,Love it makes  you look slimmer just make sure you have something underneath a tan top would work well . because you can see when you lift your arm your bra.  Love the fabric the feel of it
5.0,"These shirts are great!  I have very thin skin on my arms, and so they bruise easily.  I was looking for something to wear under a tshirt, etc.  I am short (5'1&#34;), with short arms, so I got these 3/4 length sleeves and they go clear to my wrists, which is exactly what I wanted.  Very light weight, with a silky feel.  I ordered several more, in other colors."
5.0,The fit was true to size. The material is so soft. I liked these so much that I bought a pair in black and camo.
5.0,Absolutely loved it.... went with my garden party theme
5.0,Its been so hot here but I did wear them around the house after my workout. They are super comfortable and I forgot I had them on!  I think these will outlast my last pair of another brand that I had for 4 years!  Buy them you won't be sorry!
5.0,Pants fit good and comfortable. Wash well.
5.0,I like the looks and functions. Meets my work needs
5.0,"Good quality for the price. Although it's not that sturdy or durable, I guess it will last at least 2 haloween season."
5.0,"The cubes made packing so easy to organize my suitcase. Shirts in one cube, underware in a smaller cube...This is the first time I used cubes. I was on a two week trip to Europe and could easily find what I needed and keep clean clothes separated from the used items."
5.0,"This tank top Is awesome!!More than what I expected it to be!The material is soft light and stretchy, It hugs my body correctly and is Not baggy at the bottom ,which is exactly what I wanted<br />The only thing is when I order my next I might get a size up because I am nervous about it shrinking Otherwise I absolutely Love it!![[ASIN:B06XBZWXSB TREELANCE Organic Cotton Yoga Tank Tops. Yoga Shirts for Women. Black Soul Searcher Medium.]]"
5.0,Fit great and much better quality than I expected for the price.
5.0,I love the costume!! It fits great!! Just make sure u size up. I usually wear a 2x and I got a 3x and fits perfect!!
5.0,"This is the perfect casual summer dress. I feel like I can dress this up or down. I've worn this on dog walks and to work and I always get many compliments. The top part of the dress is a stretchy material, so it's comfortable on hot humid days. The bottom has enough coverage and it comes up to my knees. One thing I didn't like about this was the skirt material can get wrinkly. I usually hang this up in the closet to prevent wrinkling. Light ironing will most likely take care of that problem but unfortunately I don't own an iron."
5.0,The cover up  is a great color and will show off a tan nicely.
5.0,"Love these underwear! They‚Äôre just precious! Wish they were amazon prime. That‚Äôs all that‚Äôs holding me back from ordering another pair.<br />There are well-made, quality underwear."
5.0,Fantastic for nursing at great price.  Quite soft and stretchy in certain areas.  My only complain is that I wish they he the same in short sleeve.
5.0,"Perfect, these are great for earrings that are heavy."
5.0,Super cute and great for the price. I‚Äôll get  in more colors if I can.
5.0,"Comfy, easy to get on and off. Very cute trucks, motivational."
5.0,"Canvas material is really durable. The nipple did come slightly fused and had to puncture some more to open flow. Lid must be TIGHTLY and properly closed or it will leak at the top. That's being said, it's pretty great. Plastic rings are strong for attaching tools with carabiners. I wear it at work all the time. Basically a Camelbak for a fraction of the price."
5.0,Masks were cool but a lil too big for me
5.0,"you want a soft comfortable slipper for you to relax in? well look no further, these slippers and happy feet slippers in general are the best and the softest slippers i have ever felt.. after a long day of being on your feet you will want these on immediately to be comfortable and cozy.. I freaking love these slippers and im usually not a guy to wear slippers just socks but after buyin my first pair i was hooked and these are my second pair cant wait to get another pair!!  added bonus they're in my favorite team!! just wish they had a pair in my brothers team Carolina panthers..."
5.0,My LO is 9 month old she started walking at 8 1/2  months and she didnt have appropriate socks as she would slip a lot i have wood floor and ceramic in the kitchen i searched for socks and after many minuted i came  across this socks and i ordered them about a week ago going two. I waited to test them first before reviewing it. Let me tell you they are amazing. She would take her old  socks off sometimes or they would come off by themselves  omg this one fit perfect and she wont never take them off. They aint that expensive but the quality is amazing. I know from where i will be buying socks as she grows. I just love them!!!
5.0,"This is a very nice jacket. It is a very light fabric and it fits my husband perfectly. I measured him before ordering, so if you're buying be sure to do the same. Great inexpensive item for the occasion where we'll be spending lots of time in the sun."
5.0,"These are soft, not too tight, but tight enough to keep ""the girls"" in check.  True to size and great value."
5.0,Gave it as a gift and it's very soft and comfy.
5.0,"I'm glad I listened and sized down. I'm 5'7, 177lbs and I ordered a Medium. The fit was perfect! the dress is flattering and stylish. Love it, would buy it again in another color."
5.0,"like the size ,easy access and water proof."
5.0,"The wife really liked these.  The ""brown"" are as shown in the pictures more of a white tone overall with perhaps a hint of brown.  Fit to size."
5.0,"I sprayed the hat with some Scotchguard.  Then stuffed bubble wrap inside the crown. The hat fits great, looks great. Will order more this month as gifts. Would like the company to make this in a solid black ."
5.0,Perfect for my sons football practice s jersey.
5.0,"Beautiful, shiny send super petite! Love them, exactly what i was wanting! Is hard tho find the spider ""diamonds""...im always finding the larger ones when all i want is something that doesn't stand out on my nose... and basically want it to look like a tiny glitter on my nose.  Perfect!!"
5.0,"I am extremely pleased with these. Retail stores stopped selling them years ago. Haven't had any since I was a teenager, reliving my youth"
5.0,the shirt was like a bra but the shorts are cute with everything else
5.0,Wow! This dress fits like a glove comfortably in my regular size!!! It is a very nice material and it makes me look really put together!!! It's hard for me to find a dress I like this much! Guess I'm gonna have to schedule some fancy dinners!
5.0,"Very pretty baubles for jewelry.  However, there are two beads in each packet (I got two packs) have beads that are bigger, but more on the brown spectrum of the color wheel.  That's a real shame, since they are the larger beads in the bag and there are only 10 beads per bag.  Feels like they just couldn't get rid of them otherwise, so the slipped them in with the red selections, since fall is coming to a close.  Not happy that 20% of my RED beads are actually brown."
5.0,So fierce and good quality! Wear them low for a fire look!
5.0,It was a christmas gift for a close friend who almost didn't get it because it was so lovely I wanted to keep it for myself lol
5.0,was a perfect addition for a Halloween costume. not only was it a good price but it looked like real hair.
5.0,Very nice bracelet and my sister in law is making it into a charm bracelet. Not really a byzantine because of the spacing it is very open
5.0,Bought this for my adult daughter.  She loves it and quality is great.  Very nice and affordable.
5.0,"Good! Haven't use it, looks nice!"
5.0,"Once upon a time, many lifetimes ago, I wore size 5 and then 7.  Vanderbilt jeans never let me down.  Now that those tiny days are distant memories, Vanderbilts are still my favorite basic jeans, even in a much larger size.  I have been purchasing these....gee, has it been 30 years??  Through thick and thin. Recommended"
5.0,Great for the price. It‚Äôs slinky stretchy material. Cute with tights and boots.
5.0,"Great item!  The necklace has this little book that opens up and, inside, there is a watch.  My teenage daughter just loved this!  She wore it to school and her friends thought it was awesome.  Lots and lots of compliments.  They are all Death Note fans but, this is a very cool item even if you are not.  We are going to buy another one as a gift."
5.0,Bought this for my daughter. She loves it.<br />She is 5'1 tall and 115 lbs.
5.0,"Love this belt. My husband wore his first one out so we had to get him another, he liked it so much!"
5.0,"I had a ""backup"" pair of regular glasses that I wanted to turn into sunglasses.  I read the information about measuring the frames carefully so that I would choose the right size and then placed my order.  The  Clip-Ons installed easily and fit perfectly over my prescription glasses.  Excellent product--very pleased!"
5.0,Very comfortable slipper.  Seems to be well made.
5.0,Beautiful bracelet! The pictures do not do it justice. I wore this to my wedding rehearsal dinner and received so many compliments on it.
5.0,This is a lovely but very sheer dress.Fit is perfect for me.One dress I wont have to have hemmed.I wear a extra small so I was glad this is one that actually fit.Adjustable straps and very affordable.I wish they had more in other color's.Hoping they sell again at the same price.I would not recommend washing in the machine or dryer due to the delicate fabric.Hand wash and line dry.So glad I was able to buy it after I mistakenly cancelled my order and it kept coming up unavailable.One of the nicest dresses I have recieved.
5.0,My Grandson love these shoes
5.0,Really pretty!!
5.0,Liked the quality and style
5.0,Comfortable and stylish. I get compliments every time I wear these boots.
5.0,So cute and well made! The material is very soft and my 8 month old looks adorable in it. I definitely recommend it! I added some felt feathers to it to make it look like a turkey for his thanksgiving photos
5.0,They are exactly what they look like online
5.0,Perfect gift for my sister who is taking care of my 95 year old mother.  She deserved this shirt.  She earned it.
5.0,I ordered (USA) Medium & it fits great.
5.0,It is not hugging the body.
5.0,It was a Christmas gift for a friend.
5.0,I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THESE EARRINGS! They are perfect size and perfect style.
5.0,The fit was perfect and they were very soft and comfortable. They also washed well.
5.0,"These are a good pair of jeans, well made, fit is spot on and look fairly stylish.<br />Got these for only $12.99 ... and for the price, they exceeded my expectations. Certainly comparable to similar jeans in the $30 - $40 range.<br />I also have some Diesel jeans, Silver, and Lucky jeans ... and while I would not compare these to the aforementioned, these are easily a 5 star pair of jeans when comparing them to others that might fall in the neighborhood of $13.<br />I typically wear a 33/30, however, I got these in the closest size available, 34/31. They fit as expected, just slightly loose at the waist, well cut through the legs (not snug, nor baggy), and the length is just a tad longer since I went with a 31. Overall, the fit is good and appearance-wise, they also look fine. Just enough whiskering & fading to give them some style. The left leg also has a small area near the front pocket with an abrasion (not a hole, tear, rip, etc) just enough of a minor abrasion to add some character. Otherwise, the jeans themselves are un-branded ... there are no tags or patches on the back denoting the brand.<br />These are well made lightweight jeans, not too thin. They also have some stretch to them which adds to the comfort factor.<br />Overall, these are a great find at $12.99. If you're looking for low cost jeans that also look good, these are well worth it."
5.0,excellent and friendly customer service.
5.0,I found the piece of good quality for the price charged
5.0,These readers are by far better made than the drugstore brands I have been buying for three times the price.  I would definitely recommend them.
5.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift and it was a hit!  Received quickly in a nice bag.  Looks exactly as pictured and very pretty.  Will shop with this seller again.
5.0,I got this for my girlfriend and she was instantly impressed by how it looked she almost didnt want to wear it cause she thought it was to expensive lol. But when she did wear it she got so many compliments about it.
5.0,"All pieces came separately no gloves so remember to buy those,I wore with docs,scared lots of people"
5.0,Looks just like the picture.  They came packages very well and in very good condition.  They are light and fit well.
5.0,Most people say that their cosplay was to small.. When ordering a cosplay you need to remember to order a size up. Most of the time it will say if its a Asian size or not
5.0,Link removal tool broken. So not really saving any money.
5.0,"The drop seat works fantastic. Lots of pockets in perfects spots.  Could use extra layer on the seat , thighs fronts, and front on the arms.  It's my first time out and I was not cold but could see on super cold days these three areas would benefit from additional padding for warmth."
5.0,Gift receiver loved the bracelet!
5.0,Well packaged and pretty earrings!
5.0,Love these. U can cinch up the sides and they hug ur boody.
5.0,Fits my son great I brought this in a 3T and another in 2T. Love them they are really cute.
5.0,I ordered this to go with my 9 year old daughter's unicorn costume. It's cute and fit perfectly!
5.0,"I really love this particular t-shirt, the fit, the color everything is just right especially here in Florida where it's very hot right now in July I'm 5 foot 2 120 lb and the small fits me perfectly and almost fitted. I'm very happy I made the choice to get this don't hesitate to get this if you're interested in a cute sleeveless summer tee."
5.0,Love these! Super nice material and fit perfectly!
5.0,"Super cute, my ten year old loved them. They seem to fit true to size. Great shoe for school."
5.0,"I just lost a bit of weight, which helps with this shirt because it is a tight-fitting sort of spandex material. Fortunately, I read the other reviews, so I bought a size up. It's quite elegant, and it encourages me to stay fit so I can wear shirts like these. It will show your shape though. The best part..I was pleasantly surprised to find it has thumbholes!! I had been wanting a shirt with thumbholes and didn't realize this had them! Overall, a great workout shirt that you can wear to other occasions like lunch, too, since it's so nice!"
5.0,My 10 yr old daughter loved it!  She has been wearing it for weeks now with no problems.
5.0,The loops are so much better than other types!
5.0,Best best thing! I have bad stomach issues and always struggle with belts because it would hurt with the pressure. This eliminates that for me you are a God sent!
5.0,This was everything.
5.0,I like the cut and having the pockets is nice. True to Size!
5.0,These shoes are fanatastic. I initially ordered them starting with size 9 because of the price. We‚Äôve ordered every size up (now on size 12) as my son has grown out of them.  The velcro has come off after several months of daycare wear and tear on two pairs but we bought velcro strips with adhesive and that allowed my son to continue to wear them completely out until there was no hope of salvaging. Now that he is in kinder he puts them through rough playground and gym time wear and they have held up. Eventually I think the velcro will give but in my opinion it has not been premature and the adhesive velcro will work to keep them going for a little while longer.
5.0,My husband loves this shirt... Told me I should buy one for our adult Yankees fan son!
5.0,So lovely....my daughter cannot wait to wear it
5.0,"I love anything Wonder Woman and this was a perfect way to show off that love in the winter!! The blue in the picture is a lighter blue than the actual color on the scarf, but I prefer the darker blue so I was not upset by this. I have washed it a couple times and have had no issues with pulls, stretching or fading."
5.0,Can't wait to style. Have the shoes to match!
5.0,I was skeptical because of the price and ordering from somewhere I‚Äôm not familiar with. After reading all the reviews I said ok I‚Äôll try it. Great quality fits perfect.It looks exactly like the sale picture as far as color and print.Definitely would order from same company again!Only fall down was the communication of receiving the package but after writing them it came the next day.So it took about a week to get it instead of prime 2 days!
5.0,Best sneakers I've ever had. Super comfortable and light weight.
5.0,"Love these earrings!  I had a similar pair, lost one of the earrings, and was delighted to have found such a nice replacement."
5.0,"I purchased these to wear at night because I have eczema and wear them to assist in prescription lotion absorption. I'm a female and hang long slender hands. A size large worked perfectly for what I needed. Also, they wash well."
5.0,"full coverage, fits well! cute!!!"
5.0,Love this bag! Super cute and just the right size to fit all the things I need!
5.0,"Loved it so much, when I left it behind out of town I bought another omw home!"

5.0,They are very very beautiful and a good quality. My fiance is a producer and he was very very happy
5.0,"Didn't like the extremely long blouse, as a personal preference, I cut it to achieve that look"
5.0,Vital stats: 41-33-44. I bought the XXL in the reddish purple one. The fit was true to size.<br /><br />The colour blend lifts the sophistication and pizazz of the design. The deep cobalt/violet accents complement the lace detail very nicely. The neckline is great too.<br /><br />PS: This dress is low maintenance - NO IRONING WAS NEEDED!!!! *happy dance*<br /><br />Very pleased with the purchase!
5.0,Great wallet
5.0,"The dress was amazing,  I love the material and the fit. Its really true size. Wasn't disappointed at all"

5.0,These gloves have worked well for my small hands and wrists. I'm glad they were sold in 3 packs.
5.0,Tama√±o
5.0,"Absolutely love it. I have to wear a slip underneath though, because i am not ready for any Marylin Monroe moments."
5.0,I really like this bracelet. The black and silver looks really nice together and the clasp closes very nicely. It is large and it great for bigger wrists.
5.0,Great pjs. Very warm and comfy.
5.0,"These fit a little smaller than i thought, but I love the look of them"
5.0,"Good compression socks, worked well. No swelling in long transatlantic flights. Comfortable once on, not too tight. Would use afsin"
5.0,"Very cute necklace. I love the idea that nobody gets what this is unless they ask. Plated with authentic 18k Gold for the longest lasting, most elegant shine possible. Made with the finest 925 Sterling Silver for stunning detail that lasts a lifetime. Pendant - 1.25‚Äù high by 1.5&#34; wide. Chain -16‚Äù long oval-linked chain with 3&#34; extender. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review of the product. I only review products that I am currently looking to purchase. If my opinion changes, I will update my review accordingly. This product I would highly recommend. If you have any further question, please feel free to comment and I would love to help you to the best of my ability."
5.0,Very sturdy and comfortable. I am visually impaired and need sunglasses all day.  These are the best inexpensive ones Ive found so far.
5.0,"These gloves are very warm and comfortable. I bought them for my husband who has to park pretty far from work. He said he can still grip the steering wheel, scroll through his phone, dig in his pockets, and flip through his keys the same as if he didn't have them on, which is a huge plus. I am going to get myself a pair, too."
5.0,"great product, fast delivery"
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with the fit! I‚Äôm a size 12, pear shaped, and have a postpartum waistline.. this  A-line fit is really flattering. I‚Äôm happy with this dress."
5.0,"IÔ∏èts so cute! IÔ∏è got the bird print... the only thing that holds IÔ∏èt closed is the tie, just wanted to note that. But if you maybe added a button or went up a size, IÔ∏èt should fix that"
5.0,"beautiful! lovely design and very lightweight. i have not had much luck finding labradorite earrings that really highlight the stone, but these earrings are open behind the gem allowing light to enhance. for a somewhat largish earring, they are well-balanced. for anyone who likes labradorite, these are a steal."
5.0,Coming from a Tokyo Ghoul fan & someone who lives in a required mask area due to covid. This thing is great all the way around.  Excellent quality and design.  I like that I can ad the nostril holes myself for customization.  I were this with the attachable eye piece for cosplay and without eyepatch when just going out and about and I put a little bit of cotton in the nose area and wear this out and about due to covd-1.  Since to point of the mask is to stop the wearer from spreading the wearers germs it works great.
5.0,"I love this ring. It‚Äôs not too thick of a band, and the colors are just a hint, so I can wear it every day without it being too flashy. I did have a little issue with sizing, but I have large hands."
5.0,I wore this for a costume and it worked out great.
5.0,"I really like these earrings; they are a beautiful deep red color with small, thin black stripes. I had been a little concerned about size when a few other reviewers said they were a little big, but I thought they were the perfect size. Also, they don't come with posts, so be sure to put some on so that they don't slip off."
5.0,Bought for my son who is obsessed with Hulk. He absolutely loves it!!
5.0,I loved the fit of the shorts and jacket. The top was a little small but I expected that because I have big boobs. Everything else fit perfectly.
5.0,A little tight in the arms but nothing too uncomfortable. Fits well overall
5.0,This necklace is truly beautiful.  It looks like it cost ten times more than it does.  It sparkles when the light catches it.<br />The presentation of this item is exceptional too.<br />When you open the case containing the necklace a little light comes on that shines directly on the necklace.<br />Never seen such a thing before.<br />Highly recommended.
5.0,Price much cheaper compare to store and other online shopping sites and very good quality product.
5.0,works great.  thanks
5.0,Looks great.  The quality was great also.

5.0,"Love the color. Perfect size for license, credit cards and a little cash."
5.0,my daughter loves these and we get compliments everywhere - i know 2 people who already ordered for their kids too

5.0,Very happy that I found a good fit.
5.0,"IÔ∏è have large legs and these boots were not a problem fit wise at all! IÔ∏è can‚Äôt say enough good things about them. They fit great, they are comfortable, and they are in general the perfect boots. They are quite high up though. IÔ∏è wasn‚Äôt expecting them to go so far past the knee, but since they fit so well, it wasn‚Äôt a problem."
5.0,So cute.  I'm typically a US lg-xl.  I'm 5'2 160 pounds.  I got a lg.  And they are perfect.  Super comfortable and fun.

5.0,I BROUGHT THIS TOP .  I  ABSOLUTELY  LOVED IT .  THE FIT WAS PERFECT  .  I  HAD SO MANY  COMPLIMENTS  .  IT GOES WITH EVERYTHING  . ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITES . AMAZON.  ITS SO WORTH IT . SHOPPING  AT AMAZON IS MY # 1 PLACE TO SHOP ONLINE . FOR EVERYTHING. .
5.0,Saw this same exact dress on an online boutique for three times this price!! Super cute summer dress. Fabric wrinkles but easy to steam out
5.0,Excellent all in one package!  My kids seem to like the goggles and the extra phone thing and the swim cap are awesome as well.
5.0,"These lenses are just as good, if not better, than the original lenses. The lenses arrived in their own box with lens bag/cleaning cloth. Installation was a breeze and these fit perfectly. I feel like these lenses are slightly darker, which is great for me. My vision with these lenses is clear, exactly like the original lenses. Cleaning these lenses seems to be much easier, but that may be because they are new. I will be looking to purchase another set in the near future."
5.0,"There are few REAL breakthroughs in products that people have been struggling with for years... THIS product is a real breakthrough.  For those of us who rely on hearing AND eye protection there is always the problem that when eye protection &#34;arms&#34; are on they have to go UNDER the muffs... this BREAKS the sound seal and reduces whatever the stated Db protection rating is... Magnetically attaching to the outside of the muff allows the SEAL to remain unbroken and hence increases the value and protection of the muff... now most of us also &#34;double-up&#34; on hearing protection with ear plugs, but even with that, if the arms of the eye protection are forcing the muff away from our heads we are NOT getting the hearing protection that we think we are....  Don't loose your hearing...  Magna Lens is a must."
5.0,"My teenage son loves these. He said they are so soft and comfortable. In his own words, it‚Äôs like a hug. Lol!! He only wants the bamboo briefs now. He has even convinced his older brothers to switch to them. So now I‚Äôm on the hunt for more since these are temp unavailable. All 3 of my sons body build so their quads are larger and needs briefs with a good stretch that doesn‚Äôt pinch or bind. Plus, they need briefs that will move with them, and not ride up, during leg day. These are the ticket right here!!"
5.0,Very cute earrings.  They can go with just about anything!
5.0,Lo devolver√© pero me gusta as√≠ que lo comprar√© de nuevo
5.0,"Love everything about this skirt. The denim has just the right amount of stretch to accommodate ups and downs of a few pounds, and is long enough to cover what i want to cover."
5.0,"I wear it all the time! Cute style, great length. I always get compliments.<br />Wear spanx the skirt is white so its lightly see through."

5.0,"I bought this dress to wear to a class reunion.  It's flattering, I love it."
5.0,She loves it and so do I. It holds tight and offers a real feel.
5.0,"Thought it was going to run a little small so ordered size larger and it fit perfect! Ordered for a costume, however nice enough to wear otherwise.  Really good quality."
5.0,"This was exactly what I was expecting. The &#34;gem&#34; looks a lot more opal-y in person and less iridescent, which I was happy about. It stays in well and the hook doesn't show or move around a lot. The gem seems pretty standard size, not too big and not too small."
5.0,We love these shoes!!! üòçüòçü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñ
5.0,Super comfy love it
5.0,"I always have trouble with the toes in compression stockings so it felt like these footless ones would be a good fit.  They are comfortable, thick but don't make my legs feel hot and have just enough compression to stop my legs from feeling fatigued after a long work day."
5.0,So cute and easy to put in and take out.
5.0,Great heavy material and vibrant colors.  Great product for a great price!
5.0,Classic!  Pretty sure I felt not being in the gym when I put it on

5.0,It's very nice and I am very happy with it.  Good quality.
5.0,Fits great. Don‚Äôt sweat in it. Absolutely loveit
5.0,"Very durable, comes clean, stays put on the job. I am a registered nurse and work nightshift at a hospital so whatever I can do to stay comfy and not have my gloves snap in half with my engagement ring I will be doing every work night, plus this way my diamond isn‚Äôt going to have disgusting germs from all the crazy things we see in Med Surg either! Win-win!! Definitely recommend this ring!"
5.0,"I'm 5'8"" and ordered a large. Usually I wear a med. I'm in love with this jumper. So flattering"
5.0,"Love this robe, it‚Äôs super soft and cozy!"
5.0,Just enough room to pack necessities for a 3 day trip.
5.0,"These earrings are so beautiful and 'WELL MADE&#34;, came in a very nice box; even though the price is very low but it looks like an expensive jewellery. I was very impressed! I would buy them in a different colors. THANK YOU:)"
5.0,but is wrinkles easily
5.0,"Adorable summer hat. Usually, I'm not too much of a hat person- but I really love this hat! It goes with nearly every summery outfit! I can wear my long hair down, throw on a cute maxi dress and this hat and have an adorable outfit for the day! The eyelet lace on this is so feminine and adorable. This is nice and lightweight and breathable. It will keep the sun out of your eyes nicely. It does run slightly small, but does fit my head just fine. The benefit of a snug fit is that if it is windy outside this hat will stay nicely put. I seriously love this hat and I don't own many hats. I can't wait for summer to roll around so I can wear this! My daughter keeps stealing it from me already too! Love the hat, will definitely recommend.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,I loved this top. I'm a 34 DDD is was too tight around my bust but the waist was perfect. I ordered a medium. I had to return because it was so small
5.0,lovely vest would buy another color
5.0,its very pretty pink
5.0,Very good product. I feel confident that if I drop my key accidently that I will not damage them.
5.0,its awesome
5.0,Great fit and love the style!  Easy to wear to work or more casual places.
5.0,"I loved the weight of the shirt, considering I was searching for a long wool-blend shirt for a trip to Atlanta, Georgia during the month of December. So it was great to keep me warm with leggings underneath. However, there were no pockets. I would have preferred pockets. Nonetheless, I still deem it a great buy! I would definitely recommend others to purchase."
5.0,Love this fit my face like a glove
5.0,"I get compliments on this all the time, true to size."
5.0,Great product; arrived on time; reasonably priced
5.0,Best wallet ever. Can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs in my pocket. I will never carry any other kind of walket
5.0,I LOVE IT!  HAVE GOTTEN MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT
5.0,"Perfect for vacay, husband loved it"
5.0,"I purchased these sports bras because I was looking for something that would fit snugly, to help my chronic pain, and would hold its shape so I would be able to wear it with many types of outfits.  Usually I wear a 38 B or C and was concerned when I opened the package because the the cup size looked like it would fit my daughter who wears a DD.  I need not have worried, they fit perfectly and were exactly what I was looking for.  They are made of a thicker quality fabric and are very comfy.  I see other reviewers talking about the padding...the only padding in mine is the flimsy kind included to make sure your nipples do not show that you remove when you wash the bra.  I would defiantly buy these again."
5.0,"Received on time, sent as a gift, am sure it fits, as expected!"
5.0,Muy lindo! Me encant√≥
5.0,Just like miniature pool balls. Well made.
5.0,Comfortable fit and well designed!
5.0,Very sturdy socks they stay up. I ran a 6 mile race using these and they worked out great. I found that if I leave them on after the race though the compression starts become uncomfortable. But for socks during the race they were great. This is the first and only pair of compression socks I've ever used. So I cannot compare them to any others.
5.0,Super!! Teens shoes. Big boys shoes
5.0,"I've dropped 30 pounds since i got this.  I still eat whatever i want. I use this when mowing the yard and cleaning the house.  I can't excercise much cuz of medical conditions. Si this is about onky excercise i get. My husbandwho is blind has noticed the difference.he said he can feel my curves in my waist now, and i feel alot skinner. He loves me either way"
5.0,Awesome statement earrings! Good quality and the clip-ons are gentle and comfortable.
5.0,Very pleased with this mask for the price.
5.0,My son will not wear any other pair night shorts!! We now own 5 pair! They wash and wear well and he says they are super comfortable!!
5.0,"I wanted a robe to wear while I get ready in the morning. I needed something lightweight because I wanted to wear it while I blow-dried my hair and I wanted it to be long so that I could sit in it and have my whole body covered. This fit both bills - it is soft without being too thin and offers great coverage. I do not overheat while blow-drying and it is almost to my ankles. Also, having the belt sewn on is unintentionally one of my favorite things about this robe - I never lose the tie!"
5.0,I have lost it and can no longer use it. But it seemed to work well once I figured it out.
5.0,muy bonito y queda  muy bien
5.0,Perfect belt easy to adjust and looks good
5.0,Really nice little jacket decals are awesome
5.0,"They are super cute! Delicate without being too fragile, I'm pleased with my purchase."
5.0,I love this bag. Beautiful color!
5.0,I never take these off! I've been wearing them for about 5 months straight. They are still perfect and shine like diamonds. Love them!!!
5.0,My 4 year old is constantly asking to wear my jewelry. I needed something that looks real but can take some abuse. This necklace is perfect.
5.0,SOooo comfortable
5.0,"I am 5'6, waist 26"", hips 38""<br />I bought the medium in white. And they fit perfectly!<br />I do like that they are flexible at the waist not tight at all, so I can wear them high or lower. There is no elastic in the front which is what I wanted. There is a light elastic in the back so there is no gaping. The white pair is a bit sheer. Not too bad. But I thought ahead and bought a white pair of snip it petti pants to wear under them. If you don't know what that is its basically a full length slip for pants or a pant liner. If you get a white petti pant to wear under white linen the pockets won't show ;) The only con is that at first the crotch was a bit odd. It's long which is fine but it layed funny. So I just gently pulled the fabric sideways towards my hips a few times to stretch it out and bam. Now it lays just right. It's the kind of fabric that you can spray with some water and stretch a bit if you want a looser look. It does look and feel like linen. I will be ordering another color!"
5.0,A beautiful color that compliments several of my jackets
5.0,"I really can't complain for the price. The material is a nice silk feel, and the zipper seems durable. Good for those of us in too much of a hurry to tie a necktie."
5.0,"Love these.  Get so many compliments on them.  Wear them everyday.  Gold will rub off, but it doesn't bother me.  They still look nice."
5.0,"My daughter doesn‚Äôt usually like long, warm socks but in Colorado it is necessary to have them if you plan to spend a lot of time in the snow.  Perhaps she has also accepted these because of the cute animals.  Anyway, these are the only really warm socks she will wear when heading out to play in the snow and so I would give them high marks from me.  They are tightly woven so the quality from my standpoint is also worth the price tag."
5.0,Love the socks.  Well made!
5.0,These are super adorable. I love the way they look. I have bunions so as far as comfort i'm not one to judge. If you have normal feet they will be good. I wear them all the time and just put thick socks on.. I need just a little less room in the foot but I also have thin socks
5.0,"The Life is Good shirts tend to be a little pricey, but the cotton used is sooooo soft, its worth it, at least to me. I'm a big girl (usually wear 18W, 1X, 2X and XXL) and ordered the XXL and they're big on me. They're definitely generously sized."
5.0,This is a great belt. I use it for work and it handles a lot of use like a champ. Would by this again! (If I ever wear it out).
5.0,I love love love these Jammies! I've bought two pair so far. I buy a size up so they are loose and cozy. I love that they have no hood!
5.0,"Loved the glasses! They fit perfectly and look great. Incredible quality for the price, and I get compliments on them everywhere I go! They arrived in less than a week, and showed up before the expected delivery date. Like I said, absolutely perf!"
5.0,Very very cute
5.0,Looks and feels like stock. Pretty sure they‚Äôll hold up
5.0,Love this!<br />I got 3 colors.<br />Nice and soft. Fits just right.<br />I am 5 feet and 190 lbs and ordered the XL.<br />Just beautiful.
5.0,"I've tried all kinds of bands (silicone, cloth) from many brands. I have incredibly sensitive skin and inevitably get a rash no matter how frequently I clean the band. I thought I'd do well with woven cloth, but that one failed me and, after spending much money on bands, I decided to give this one a shot. I've had it for a while now and it has only given me one tiny spot on my wrist. I switched it to the other hand and it's been fine since. I wear it when working out (i sweat A LOT), but try to take it off when showering or at the beach."
5.0,"I‚Äôve had these pants for a little while now less than a year or so. They‚Äôve worn up great, the ribbon hasn‚Äôt pulled away anywhere, no tearing at the seems. They‚Äôre a little tight at the band but that‚Äôs probably just me, I could‚Äôve went up a size. The bottom parts around the ankles ride up a bit too but that depends on where you wear the band, I wear mine high-waisted so they ride up."
5.0,very long for short people but comfortable
5.0,Outside of the smell (which is tolerable)the product works extremely well along with the copper sulfate solution. Put the liver of sulfur (4 ounces) into 2 gallons of water and 2 ounces of copper sulfate in 2 gallons of water and your ready to antique brass. The entire process takes less than an hour.
5.0,Nice n elegant look! Shipped on time
5.0,Stylish and comfy! It's lose fitting and goes great with leggings (: I almost want it in other colors
5.0,"I‚Äôm absolutely in love with this jumpsuit!<br />The fit is perfect!<br />It‚Äôs loose in all the right places, but not ‚Äútoo loose‚Äù just enough to be comfortable.<br />The material is nice and soft also. I tried it on yesterday and loved it so much, that I ended up wearing it for the rest of the day, I got several compliments of people asking me where I got it.<br />What I love most is, it can be dressed up/ or down depending on how you‚Äôd like to wear it. It‚Äôs very versatile. Annnnnd it has pockets! Win-Win!<br />I ordered the medium and the sizing was spot on for me, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 135lbs and this came right above my ankles in length.<br />I love this jumpsuit so much, I plan to order a few more colors as this would be great for the hotter months of the year."
5.0,"I love the idea of this, and it's the perfect gift for a dear sister who is going to the Temple this month.  And the person who i 'chatted' with on Amazon was very very helpful."
5.0,so beautiful. came with a great bag.
5.0,Quality material and construction.  A bit longer than expected... a little big all over to be honest.  Legs are pretty loose.
5.0,"Great safety vest, use it every day."
5.0,"A medium fits my 5'10""-ish husband well! Maybe a bit long in the sleeves. The pocket is comfy and the material and stitching seems well done. The zipper is metal, which is nice, and the gray is a nice color as well."
5.0,"Love this dress. Thin not see through, adorable doesn‚Äôt shrink in wash. Love!"
5.0,"For someone who has sensitive skin, this band was a life savor! It‚Äôs water proof, dries up nicely, and feels secure on my wrist. The price was also great!"

5.0,I bought these for my wife and she absolutly lives them. I love them on her too. My wife has now had these over a year and they still look incredible. They don't look worn or faded. To keep them looking new just hand wash only and let them air dry.
5.0,For as expected! Kept my feet warm in 20 degree fahrenheit. traction was good in the snow and ice.
5.0,"Bought this for my niece, who is very into blue and turtles.  I was very impressed with the quality and price.  Shipping took about 4 weeks, which I didn't think was too bad.  Overall, I would definitely buy again!"

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:8b3c0586a6a42653a037369c82b99942]] OBSESSED with these!!! Lululemon quality for $10 a piece. How is this possible? They are so comfy and fit perfectly. I opted for the pack of black, blue and light purplish blue.. I‚Äôm usually insecure about lighter colored leggings bc they are less flattering on me since I‚Äôm ‚Äúbottom heavy‚Äù but they suck me in and I feel great in them. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 125lbs, ordered a Medium and they‚Äôre perfect. If you‚Äôre on the fence about ordering these just do it. You‚Äôll love them. The pockets are a major plus too :)"
5.0,"I ordered this product a little over a week ago. Since I received it I have used it every day. The belt looks and feels great, and seems to be superior quality. This was my first ratchet belt, and I will definitely be ordering another when the time comes. This brand definitely makes a quality product. Highly recommended!"
5.0,I got most of the one I wanted and they delivered so fast! Very satisfied. I was worried they would be too big a bulky but they are perfect.
5.0,This swimsuit cover is so cute!  The fit is great and also is very comfortable.  I can dress this up or make it really casual.  I would recommend this!
5.0,"Perfection! Love the high quality, thank you üá∫üá≤ü§†"
5.0,Watch bands are the same as shown. They are a bit stiff at first but soften up. Very easy to install.
5.0,This is a great gift for family and friends.
5.0,"Didn't like them, loved them"
5.0,"This has held up really well. Normally I buy sale purses from Liz Claiborne and those, within a year of use, are frayed and dingey. This has surprisingly not done that. The marerials are, clearly, not too quality, but who cares if the purse looks good and stays together for a reasonable price?"
5.0,Looks really nice on you
5.0,SO ADORABLE<br />LOVE IT
5.0,Just snug enough but not too much üòù love the length I‚Äôm a tall guy
5.0,Handy little kit - paid for itself already

5.0,These are exactly what you'd expect. My son loves them.
5.0,"Really like these. Fabric is nice and overall fit is nice and comfy.<br /><br />I am actually a size small but got a medium for extra ease at the WB cause of the elastic. I hate PJ pants or lounge pants that have thick elastic and feel too tight. Anyway, the medium actually fits like a small. Which makes me think how small a medium would be. TIP: GO UP A SIZE!"
5.0,Nice variety of colors! Fit perfectly!
5.0,"These are the absolute best panties I have ever worn.  They are so comfortable, don‚Äôt bunch up and stay put under jeans , dresses, pantyhose, whatever you got on!  My favorite thing about these panties are the feeling when I put them on.  They hold you in like a light girdle and make you look better in all your clothes! These panties laundry well.  The color is good with no fading.  Very well made.  True to size.  I would recommend!"
5.0,"I love the gray color (not too light and not too dark gray, just right)  and the elasticity is nice and snug even after several wahsings.  They don't slide down the back of my ankles (which I hate).  I plan to buy more!"

5.0,I ordered size 5T and 2 T it fits perfectly well. I really loved the material ! Thanks amazon keep the good work up for other customers too.

5.0,Beautiful chain I like the length and the sturdiness of it

5.0,"These shoes are comfortable, well made & a good fit - I will look for this brand again for shoes"
5.0,Nice bracelet great seller
5.0,Like this

5.0,Beautifully sparkling and high quality
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE these heels.! They are beautiful, well made and fit perfect.!! I will definitely be ordering again.<br />I usually wear a size 7 1/2 in shoes, but I ordered a 7 because that's the only size close to mine that was available and they fit perfect."
5.0,I have three pairs of these socks and love them all!  They are fun to wear and are very comfortable.
5.0,Stunningly beautiful
5.0,This dress is very comfortable. I got the green and black tank dress. The picture does show that it is pleated and it is not. It‚Äôs still flattering though.

5.0,Super Cute Suit! I wish the top was a bit more sturdy with the ties.love the cut and the way it looks.
5.0,"These are really fun earrings. I don't usually wear big hoops, but these are very light and comfortable. They are definitely neon green! Plastic and durable looking."
5.0,"I bought a couple of these in white and black for my better half.  I've also purchased a couple of their crop tops (the Henley type) and while I find the Henleys more entertaining, she finds these to be comfortable.  I'm extremely pleased with the way the YMDUCH products fit her, and while she prefers the more modest tanks, she likes the Henleys too."
5.0,Very adorable 2 pack of longer length shorts.The material is good and they fit great.
5.0,"The earrings look great but most importantly the mrs. Loves them. The seller also is extremely helpful and flexible when it comes to product issues. I cant thank them enough for that opportunity to resolve an issue. But if she loves it, she loves it."

5.0,I bought a few different designs so I could always have a backup. They have beautiful designs and are very well made.
5.0,This is just the cutest cat costume ever! It is extremely well made and the sizing is generous. It was fun to try on and I was delighted with how comfortable and cozy it is. May seem like a lot of money but it is worth every penny. This will wash well and wear well and it‚Äôs not Chinese sizes. Go for it!

5.0,well made. My son loves it
5.0,just simply love it will recommend!

5.0,"It was shipped in a timely manner, Which I want yesterday, not a week. Strap amazing is able to stay right where I put it. Some what large, but able to put more than I want and still keep it small"
5.0,"These should have been made to be adjustable. Not everyones head is the same. This keep slidding down, so it didn't really do any good to have a mask on. I even tried to wash it, hoping it would shrink it, but no help."
5.0,"Just got this, it seems:<br />-Very well made (real leather - verifies by leather smell)<br />-Nice buckle (stylish) (Stainless I think)<br />-Both sides are about exact<br />-Comes with extra band pins<br />Lets see how it holds up on time.  If there's nothing negative here (in my review/post), then it's still holding up!  Will report back on any issues."

5.0,"Wife likes it.  That's what matters, really."
5.0,"I love these theyre soooo cute. They even spin a little. I thought the actual pinwheel itself would be hard plastic but its flexible like a real pinwheel. I wish the part that sticks into your ear was a little longer, but its fine. They got here fast in 2 days and they're not broken, there's been no problems. LOVE THEM"
5.0,Item as described  love it
5.0,"I have 7 of these an i just love them..comphy. colors are good.  nice in the wash,shack them out,no iron needed. nice"

5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 140 pounds got this in a small and it fits perfectly.  Has pockets, fits loose but not baggy. Got a lot of compliments.  Just a beautiful, well made dress that you can dress up or down. The material is also very good quality. Getting it in another color  The hem design is very flattering"
5.0,"I love these. I have several pairs of faux sheer fleece lined tights in different colors, and these might be my favorite. They fit snugly but are long and big enough to get into and to not have the saddle sag down. They are thick and keep you warm, and the color looks like you're wearing pantyhose. My only complaint with all of the fleece lined faux sheer tights is that you can see where the fleece ends around the ankle area, so it does ruin the illusion a little. Otherwise this is exactly what I wanted."
5.0,"The suit arrived on time, looked like the picture, but it was too small for me."
5.0,this is my favorite bracelet! its so sparkly with all the stones and i love how it comes with an extension link. i have a condition where one of my arms swell up with fluid so when ever im having issues i just add the link and its still looks great. its so elegant looking like a tennis bracelet! its a great piece for any special women in your life as a gift or a just because... they will love it!
5.0,these are great. strong suction leak proof.

5.0,Everyone loved it. Was perfect for work on Halloween

5.0,Nice socks! Bought them for a present.
5.0,I read a lot of reviews that stated that the dress was ‚Äúclingy‚Äù so instead of getting my regular medium I got a large and it fit perfectly. It wasn‚Äôt too form fitting and it also didn‚Äôt look like a sheet.
5.0,Great little gym bag! Has a separate shoe compartment and a zipper compartment on the other side for wet items. The main bag has enough room for workout clothes and a towel with some room to spare.

5.0,It is wonderful. Just what we ordered.
5.0,fits her perfectly & she seems comfortable!
5.0,"We bought this bracelet and another one from the same seller. The stones are real. The 2 bracelets didn't fit us since our wrists are too small. I contacted the seller and they replied right away and offered to send us 2 new smaller bracelets with no extra cost or return.  Asked us for our wrists' size of course. We were pleasantly surprised as to how nice they are and understanding our arms and wrists are skinny. They continued to give us update reply constantly, they really care for their products and customers. The Best !!!!!! Needless to say our new smaller bracelets arrived yesterday and fit perfectly. Thank you so much."
5.0,"This was soooo cute. It looks exactly as the pic and the material is great. My daughter was turning 7, but she is very petite, she wears size 5/6 or a small in girls. I ordered the 120 and it fit perfect."

5.0,"Lightweight and very soft, great for working out"
5.0,The little socks were perfect ! She even left them on for extended periods of time!‚ô•Ô∏è
5.0,"This skirt is incredibly cute and fits true to size. I am 5'2"" and 170 lbs, the size large fits like a glove. I would give this  four and a half stars because the zipper is fairly cheap and likes to grab fabric, but it's a $25 skirt so what do you expect? I paired it with a black body suit and some Mary Janes for a work look."
5.0,Great material and good size. Must own one Reyes QP barber cape!!!
5.0,"A beautiful pendant, the details present a benevolent Lord Ganesha. to wear around my neck everyday as a reminder that all my obstacles to spiritual success will be wiped away from my path."
5.0,"This skirt is so comfortable and cute. I am about 5'8&#34;, 175 pounds with an athletic build and the large fit me perfectly! I was worried about the sizing because I have large thighs and butt with a smaller midsection and I have great difficulty finding jeans and skirts that fit me well, but this skirt was perfect! I ordered based on my waist and hip measurements and it runs true to size. There are no awkward gaps in the back and is form fitting, but not to the point that it's restricting in any way. Love this skirt and the color is a little darker than the image, but its a nice medium-lightish denim wash that's perfect for any time of the year."
5.0,"Thin belt with discrete unobtrusive (non-rodeo size) buckle, so can be worne in other countries."

5.0,Just as a casual top to wear with jeans.  Wore it out to dinner too. Loved it.
5.0,it looks really nice in actual. i am so happy to have it. great find!
5.0,Only drawback is they are too comfortable.
5.0,"I wear my coats larger for layering, and for long sleeves. I ordered Large, expecting it to run a little big, and it did. Very comfortable fit for my personal preference!"
5.0,"Fabric is a bit flimsy, but it works perfectly for a ghost costume.  It is also sheer so my sone was easily able to see out of the eye holes."
5.0,"A nice set of goggles there isn't anything cheap about them! Until the pool warms up a bit a week or two tops I wont be trying them out, but years of having a pool I know quality when I see it! I showed them too my niece she even posed for me, and 3 of us tried them on. We all agreed they fit nicely. The big test will be the 4th of July party you will be first to know if they fail! Also every one liked the nose plug there kind of cool looking. Another plus was how they fit snug but don't mash into your face the clasp on the back keeps you from getting your hair all tangled up putting them on and taking them off. They even come with their own lens cleaning cloth. A nice case too"
5.0,"Very pretty,  arrived on time, great material"
5.0,Pefect for girls age 6-10

Lightweight but looks like it will keep my son warm. Right now he wears an 8 but I ordered the 10/12 so he'd be able to wear it longer. Very pleased with this sweatshirt."
5.0,I love the way it fits me

5.0,It does have large circles but one can wear it for a belt or a scarf. It is very long that it's fashionable and nice fabric too.
5.0,Perfect fit. Very happy with purchase
5.0,"I love this purse. I have it in lepord print as well. The purse strap is the perfect size for me. I like to walk around with my purse on me as to not set it down. The green is like starbucks green. Pretty, simple, and functional. :)"
5.0,Played tag football with Grand kids several times. Very pleased and still holding up strong etc...
5.0,"First - the size - I am 6'1 225 and wear a mens size Large Polo. I ordered the Large size, and the fit s exactly as I expected. an XL would be baggy or not tight enough; a medium may fit but be tighter than desired for all day wear.<br /><br />I like the material, almost feels as if you don't have it on. The length is nice, stays tucked even if m polo's don't.<br /><br />I initially ordered a single pack of 3 to try for size. Came back today to by 2 more 3-packs and write this review.<br /><br />Happy Customer."

5.0,The best daypack for mountain bikers on the market!!<br /><br />Just enough space for all the essentials.<br /><br />Small enough not to be too cumbersome.<br /><br />Great back pack for alpine or Nordic skiing too.
5.0,"I bought a medium in these jeans and the waist fits perfect but I hope to not put on any weight as they would be too tight and not look right  I got a size medium and my normal size jeans are about a 6 depending on the brand,  the legs and hips are a little bigger than I would like but it doesn't look bad and are very comfortable.<br />I wasn't suppose to receive them until 4/25/22 but they came 4/2/22 which I was thrilled about so great job to the seller for shipping much sooner than expected.<br />I definitely would recommend these jeans."
5.0,"I love this dress, I'm 5 foot with a bit of a mummy tummy and the large does a good job flattering my figure. The pockets are roomy too. I pair it with a green sweater for work and have gotten tons of complements."

5.0,"I love it!! It‚Äôs exactly as pictured and the pin clasp is not too difficult to open, so I am able to remove the pin if we are using different vehicles (different car seats)!<br />Only thing I would say that is a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù is the actual pin arm is a bit thick, so it will leave a set of holes wherever you place it."

5.0,"easy to adjust, fits well.  very well put together"
5.0,They are awesome. Very dark though some people may not like that. But I love them

5.0,"I like these a lot!! I live in Louisiana so sometimes they get a little warm but thats okay.  They're really cute and I wear them just about everywhere. It kinda makes certain things to do hard but that's okay too and inside the glove there's this white layer and that often pokes out the finger parts and I go >:(( but overall, I love these gloves"
5.0,Exactly like the picture great material worth the money
5.0,"Even though the box my product when damaged when it arrived, luckily my hat wasn't damaged. My new hat is comfortable to wear and makes me look cool while wearing it. I wear mine anytime I go anywhere that's casual or when I'm having a bad hair day, ha ha. Seller is highly recommended. I look forward to do doing more business with the seller in the future."

5.0,"These fit me great!  For less expensive hiking pants, I was impressed. Good pockets, they roll up to be shorter for hot days, and they worked quite nicely for a short hike.  I'll be wearing them on longer hikes next summer, but I'm not anticipating any problems with them."
5.0,I got it for my son in law's birthday and he loves it and wears it all the time
5.0,Very nice large colorful scarf. Looks exactly as advertised. Soft and festive for fall. I get compliments whenever I wear it. I like to wear it under my black leather bomber jacket to give the outfit some color. It‚Äôs a great way to throw together a classic all black outfit. Would look great with browns and burgundy‚Äôs too.
5.0,A 50th birthday disc party
5.0,I receive compliments on it all the time.  And I have my children‚Äôs  names on it.
5.0,"These are simply cheap (inexpensive) little posts with a gem atop. They post is plastic rather than metal to eliminate the issue of sensitivity to nickel etc. Well, I effing LOVE them. I'm not a child, I'm a grown woman who happens to continue to fill 3 piercing per lobe and simply wants to feel pretty without worrying about irritation. These little cuties fill the bill. Very pleased! the colors are vivid, sparkly in the sun, and although the gems aren't all perched EXACTLY perfectly, a few stones askew won't deter me. After all, they were under 10 bucks. Who would complain about THAT? The few I have that are askew, work anyway, as you cannot even tell once they're in the lobe. Bravo."
5.0,These are just the right size and really pretty
5.0,Love the dress!!
5.0,Beautiful looks just like picture.

5.0,"I absolutely LOVED this bra, unfortunately it was a tad too small so I had to return it. I had an XL but my 38D/40D's needed an XXL and it doesn't come in that large of a size. I didn't get full coverage."
5.0,Arrived quicker than expected. As described
5.0,Fit perfectly especially the bottoms.

5.0,I liked the look and that it was just longer enough to not feel tight
5.0,Color as photo described! Very comfortable and warm. Comes without any scents (no chemical or any plastic smell).

Definitely worth the price!!

5.0,As a gift I cannot know how it fit. I haven't heard any complaints.
5.0,Purchased this for SWMBO. She says it works great for those hours when it's either dark or when the sun's rising/setting. For the price you can't go wrong.
5.0,so cute!!!!!!!
5.0,I love the way this dress fit me. It‚Äôs the right fit at the chest and is a bit loose around the tummy which i appreciate when I‚Äôm bloated. I‚Äôm 167 pounds and 5‚Äô4 and a xl fits me perfect. The dress goes just a bit under the knee.
5.0,Fit great graphic and material supberb
5.0,Very pretty. Just as pictured. Follow the size chart. I loved it and received compliments.
5.0,I loved it. My 2 year old looked adorable.

5.0,Love this cardigan! I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11 and bought the small. It hits right at my knees.
5.0,"Loved the color and fit of this dress. It flows out above the waist, a little below the bust, so it would make a great bump dress as well."
5.0,This necklace set is gorgeous and I am very impressed with the quality and color.
5.0,"I love being able to order this in bulk. My daughter goes through pointe shoes quickly, and having it is very convenient."
5.0,"Love! Love! Love! Theses are great for newborns- 3 months. Good quality for the price. Thought the quality was gonna suck because it is cheap and all, but great quality! Did not regret buying these."
5.0,.....I broke my power switch. It was my fault - and the new screen works perfectly - but I had to then replace my power switch. It was completely unrelated to the top part - but when I put it back together I pressed too hard and broke the incredibly tiny on/off switch on the motherboard. Again - my fault. This part works exactly as presented - just be careful putting the shell back together.
5.0,My daughter loves this robe! If it was up to her she would wear it all day and I can't blame her it's so soft
5.0,Size XL too small and I usually wear large
5.0,This pajamas are perfect. Super cozy!
5.0,"I've only used once so far, but roomy and strong."
5.0,They're cool and nice for the price
5.0,"This dress is beautiful! I was worried that the fabric would be cheap and see through, but it actually comes with beautiful lining inside. I highly recommend. Color was perfect."
5.0,Better than expected. It is very reflective as other comments I have read but it‚Äôs still a very nice accessory. Seems durable. Great length. Adjustable. Looks just like the image.
5.0,Seller worked hard to make sure I was a satisfied customer.
5.0,"Seems like a good quality bracelet, and the magnetic clasp is very strong. I don‚Äôt worry about it falling off at all. Some reviewers said theirs seemed to be for small wrists, but this particular style doesn‚Äôt seem to run small! The leather/cords/stones don‚Äôt look cheap either."
5.0,Super comfortable and tight. Not to mention stylish. I have no complaints. Thanks
5.0,Perfect for if you want the edginess of a septum piercing without the pain or permenacy!
5.0,Was form fitting so too small for me but love the front girls.
5.0,Wife loves.
5.0,"Love it, fast service, I will be back !"
5.0,Easy to use. Decent quality.
5.0,"These are awesome! My 6 year old got a scab and a scar across the bridge of her nose from her previous goggles, and the other ones always tangled her hair. These don't do either and are easy for her to get on and off."
5.0,"I love my helmet. It is a little hard to see out of when the lights are dim but it is really cool. I was so worries spending that much money but I love it enough to be worth it. It is a little big on my head but I wear a hat under it. Every 43 year old soccer mom needs one of these.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt know why it wants me to rate warmth. It is warm, I guess."
5.0,These cleats fit perfectly for me! Great leather cleats for a low price!
5.0,"My life was made a lot easier with this product. Carry it in the glove compartment and put it around my neck when I go shopping. Perfect for checking product description and pricing....without having to unfold my regular reading glasses, etc.<br />Makes me happy to have such a convenient product."
5.0,I LIKE THESE SLIPPERS VERY MUCH.<br />THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE.<br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE SLIPPERS FOR ANYONE.<br /><br />T. KELLEY
5.0,"This is the second pair I've bought, one for each car.  They seem to be an extremely good value.  The lenses seem very good and the unbreakable claim seems to be true so far.  The mission aspect is just icing on the cake."
5.0,great gloves and great price.  my second pair
5.0,"I had never worn compression socks before but was having trouble with my legs feeling like they were fatigued and jerking muscles. Did some research and read that varicose viens can sometimes have these symptoms. So decided to try the recommended treatment of compression socks. I saw these on Amazon and from reviews decided to try them. What a wonderful thing they are!! After the first day of wearing them my legs feel fantastic!! I have been wearing them for 3 days now and my legs feel back to normal. At night my legs have stopped jumping, the muscles are relaxed and I'm sleeping so much better. I can stay on my feet all day and I don't feel that tired leg feeling at the end of the day. I love these. Best product I have bought in awhile. They fit great. I am 5'3&#34; and average weight, the S/M fits perfect. The fabric is very nice- smooth and soft. I just bought more this morning, I never want to wear regular socks now!"
5.0,"I purchased these glasses for biking and could not be happier; The wrap style covers my entire field of vision and the temples hold comfortably around my head without obstructing my clip-style headphones.<br /><br />In short, these were the perfect glasses for me and cost a small fraction of what I would have expected to pay for such a product.<br /><br />highly recommend!"
5.0,"I am delighted with this skirt. I'm 5'10&#34; and often find that maxi dresses and skirts aren't quite long enough on me, but this one is extremely generous, enough to wear a low heel with. The fabric is wonderfully soft, and so far I haven't had any issue with the seat or knees stretching out with wear. The fit is flatteringly slim through the hips. It's an all-around great skirt."
5.0,My daughter liked it.  Does not need ironing!
5.0,Loved them just ! Light weight also
5.0,"I'm so happy with this dress. It's really a low neckline so I wear a camisole underneath. It's more of a knit/jersey material not an actual sweater fabric. it's great for fall, it may be a little thin for winter. Fits perfectly!"
5.0,"Beautiful sparkle, nice size, good value."
5.0,"So interesting. Also purchased the maple leaf. Only flaw with this, was on the back a very small spot of the copper shows"
5.0,"Iam using it almost a year. Totally comfortable, barely feeling it. Thinking about buy the second one, but different color."
5.0,My husband loves them......
5.0,Initially I ordered these for my elderly mother. I like them so much I ordered a couple packs for myself. They are so soft and very comfortable. The tops don't bind. Good quality socks and I'm fussy about my socks.
5.0,"Great swimsuit. Fits perfect, love the color... shocking since it's so cheap!"
5.0,Purchased as a stocking stuffer for my wife at Christmas. She seems to like it
5.0,These glasses come in a convenient 2 pack with sport straps included. One pair is tinted with blue with yellow light vision and are perfect for driving on bright sunny days. The yellow tint and UV blocking provides additional protection from the sunlight and makes it easier to see clearly when driving. The design is sports style and sit snugly against your face. The other pair is clear vision and has no tint. The quality is good for the price and better than I expected. The glasses look good on and I have an extra pair for multiple vehicles or as a backup. Buy these  glasses if you need to protect your eyes when driving or working outside.
5.0,"I got this watch as a replacement for an Eco-Drive watch that I had had for over ten years. The old watch still ran perfectly, but, alas, I lost it. I was heartbroken. I decided I had to have another Eco-Drive and found this one for a surprisingly reasonable price. (The price tag attached to the watch was 3 times what I paid for it.) It is beautiful. The thing I like most about this watch (and my old one) is that you never have to mess with changing out batteries; just let it have access to light, and it keeps running like a champ. The band is super long, ample enough for the wrist of an extremely large-boned, well-padded lady. I YouTubed how to take out links (not difficult), and it fits perfectly now. The packaging is minimal, but very functional. I had some trouble getting it through the slot in our mailbox, and the only thing ruined was the outer packaging; the box wasn't damaged beyond a small scrape, the contents were well protected."
5.0,Loved this item. Received many compliments when I wore it
5.0,Dress looks great and very flattering! Material is a bit rough but not scratchy. I felt beautiful in this dress. It fit just right with easy access for breastfeeding without feeling like I was ruining the dress.
5.0,Great deal! Even comes with 4 years of warranty!!
5.0,They all came and i cant wait to wear them
5.0,Very comfortable!  I‚Äôve been looking for a while.  Great price and like the way they fit.
5.0,"Smooth, comfortable and good looking.  Note: the slate/olive looking one on the left is more of a forest green, but functionally, these things can't be beat."
5.0,"Loved the packaging, the bracelet is so cute and dainty. Great for the price"
5.0,I love the luggage ring. Stone is4 beautiful. I like that you can resize the ring for different fingers.
5.0,Very satisfied with this product.  Very good idea to those little mittens on a string.
5.0,These leggings are true to size and are absolutely comfortable! The fabric is soft and feels great n my skin. You can wear these out or around the house. I love that there is pockets and a drawstring.
5.0,"The best ... looking for other neutral colors. Warm and thick . Classic style...dress down or for special occasion. I have brown, black and navy. Would love to find grey. I keep checking. Price doubled since I bought the first brown. But worth the investment!"
5.0,"This dress ended up being perfect. It fit so well and I got a ton of compliments at the company holiday party. I'm 5'7"" 138lbs with an athletic build (with some curve) and the medium fit perfectly. I'm going to buy this dress in green and black, too! At $20, I should buy every color..."
5.0,Great shorts for working out they fit great and also look great.
5.0,My wife LOVES these!
5.0,"Love love love! I have a mom apron going on and these keep it in, don‚Äôt roll down with my aerobic routine and they don‚Äôt slide down when I bend and twist. They‚Äôre even light weight so I don‚Äôt get so hot during the work out. Phone stays in the pockets also. Big fan."
5.0,Omg üò± I‚Äôm in love ü•∞ I get soooo much compliments‚Ä¶.. it looks so nice and beautiful‚Ä¶.. Thank you üôè
5.0,"Love the color, looks great on also"
5.0,"Desde que los compr√©, no se los he quitado a mi hija. Le encant√≥. Son tama√±o Perfecto, material adecuado. No ha habido alergias. Comprar√≠a otro par"
5.0,These are very nice earrings. I don't have sensitive ears so I'm not sure if the metal would bother someone else but I haven't had any problems. The design is very unique. They go into your ear at the normal place and appear to also go into another hole but they dont. I like that because I'm a scaredy cat and don't want to get a second hole. These are very nice and elegant without being too flashy and they are definitely a conversation piece when I'm out and about. I personally love dangly earrings but can't wear them most of the time because I have a baby that will pull on them. These stay close to the ear so there's less risk involved for me. I think they are well made and look much nicer than alot of other costume jewelry. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,I love this dress and so does my colleagues!
5.0,"Fits well, thick stretchy cotton, love this top"
5.0,Great shirt and good value
5.0,Very fashionable. Goes with anything.
5.0,"I have been learning about Crystal this past couple of months. Then I ran into this necklace and was completely in love with it. It came with a another pair that I gifted to my cousins that is also into crystals and she love it. It comes with a black sting which I use and a silver one. The silver one doesn't feel sturdy, unlike the black one. Putting it on makes you feel good. Every night I make sure to cleanse my crystal with Palo Santo so I'm ready to go the next day. üëå"
5.0,Just the cutest darn housecoat!  Bought several.  Suggest ordering one size down
5.0,This shipped quicker than it said it would and is great quality! Would recommend to anyone looking for an all around tote bag for your kid!

5.0,"Light weight, great for warm weather work outs."
5.0,"These flip up shades are highly effective at blocking out glare and at UV protection.  The flip up feature is extremely convenient for partly cloudy days or for walking in and out of shadows as in a city or forest.  The lenses are large enough to cover any normal size, and the clip is both large enough and sturdy enough to attach to any frame.  A rugged clear plastic case offers reliable protection for the sunglasses when you are not wearing them."
5.0,"good quality, cut. but was a tad bigger than expected"
5.0,Good quality I would order them again
5.0,"Excellent shirt.  Looks nice, feels soft, and fits great.<br /><br />Great shirt and great deal.<br /><br />Highly recommend"
5.0,Just wish there was a size 9...had to come up with something for this size 10 ring for my son.<br /><br />But he loves it!!
5.0,Works great for dance practice. Comfort fit
5.0,"I love this dress! Great product! I ordered my actual size, I was scared that it would be too small because I am very busty(big boobs) however, the dress was a perfect fit! Beautiful and comfortable!"
5.0,"I never expected to be writing a non-dance specific underwear review, but I guess there's a first time for everything!  Then again, I was a little hesitant to order 8 pairs of _anything_ this essential.  If this review helps someone else feel secure in making a purchase, then I can ride off into the sunset knowing that I've left the world a better place.<br /><br />I ordered these recently enough that Amazon still thinks they haven't been delivered yet (ha!), but they got here way ahead of schedule, and I'm glad they did (though, obviously, that means I can't say much about long-term durability right now).<br /><br />Personally, I'm a fan of minimalist underwear.  Simply put, for an active guy, it just plain gets in the way less often than the full-coverage kind.  My goal is to put my underwear on in the morning and forget about it all day.  The ideal pair brings to the table no bunching, no chafing, no sagging, and definitely no squeezing.<br /><br />SiikWorld's Ice Silk Thong Low Rise passes all those tests.  It just works.  It's comfortable and functional (and comes in a bunch of colors, though I would have been just as satisfied with an all-black set or, really, anything except all white or all beige).<br /><br />At 5'8&#34; and 156 pounds, I wear an American mens' size 32 in trousers; here, the Asian L -- equivalent to a US medium -- is a very nice fit.  It would probably do equally well for someone who wears a size 34.  If you're smaller than a size 32, I'd order the next size down; bigger than a 34, you might be able to wear the Asian L/US M, but I'm not sure.  My &#34;fits as expected&#34; rating reflects the sellers' sizing instructions.<br /><br />The waistband has a comfortable, fleecy terry backing and offers enough grip to stay where it needs to, but not so much that you feel like you've got an angry python wrapped around your waist.  The remainder of the fabric is silky, supple, and supportive -- though maybe not quite &#34;I'd use these in place of a dance belt while dancing the Le Corsaire variation&#34; supportive.<br /><br />Quality and workmanship seem pretty solid.  Should I discover any early unraveling or anything like that, I'll definitely check back in -- but right now, I expect these to last a good, long time.  (They'd better, because I just replaced half my underwear drawer with them!)  All eight pair passed my quick quality-control check.<br /><br />Definitely recommend these for anyone who leans towards the minimal-underwear approach but isn't quite into the idea of going commando.<br /><br />One more random bit: each pair comes packaged in its own little zipper pouch.  That could come in handy for travel, or you could repurpose the pouches -- they might be perfect for containing the millions of micro-USB cords that are slowly multiplying in every home in the developed world.<br /><br />I've included a photo to provide a sense of the various colors included in the package.  Not shown is the black with red waistband and trim."
5.0,"We bought them to use as roller coaster sun glasses at an amusement park.<br /><br />My son loves them and they are durable, comfortable, and keep the sun and wind out of his eyes!"
5.0,Its sooo beautiful i loved it i highly recommend it to everyone thanks
5.0,"Slipper fits well and is very comfortable and supportive. I have fallen arches and wear orthopedic inserts, so regular slipper made my feet hurt. These are so much better, no more sore feet."

5.0,daughter loved it.
5.0,Good fit comfortable
5.0,I received so many compliments on my space age glasses while in Cabo!
5.0,$15 for 2 bags that fit as a personal travel bag on Spirit Airlines. No luggage fees for the two of us.
5.0,I loved it and it has pockets :) you can wear casually or for church. The only thing is that it‚Äôs not true navy it‚Äôs a little off but it‚Äôs a pretty color
5.0,"I do have to wear a camisole thing under it, as it is pretty low cut -- you could probably do without the camisole if you're a bit taller or more long-waisted or whatever; but it still looks super cute, it's comfortable, it can go to work or anywhere. Great quality for the price. I was afraid the material would be the usual stretchy thin t-shirt type chambray -- it's not, it's a nice genuine very lightweight chambray (denim type material, but thinner). Nice."
5.0,"Smartwool socks are a must have for winter. They are warm, comfortable and have enough breathability that your feet aren‚Äôt sweating to death!"
5.0,My daughter loves her styling boots

5.0,"I have gotten alot fo compliments on these shoes, they fit as expected normal size and are confy, love them"
5.0,I love vintage/retro outfits and love polka dots. This retro swim dress is so cute and fit perfectly. I ordered 2 sizes larger because it does run small. I like the material and it gives you a nice shape when worn.
5.0,Sooooo cute!!  The Peanuts print is clear and bright.  PJ bottoms are soft and comfy.  Love these!!
5.0,"I am typically a size medium in patty boutique, but that size is not available. I ended up getting a small and was very happy with my purchase. The color is beautiful, the touching is flattering, the fabric is the best. Soft and sleeves are long."
5.0,"It fits as expected and looks great, but it is quite provocative, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll actually ever wear it. I ordered a size: M - 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 158lbs, B/C cup, athletic build, normally wear size 8."
5.0,They are kinda big and that was great - love the size... they are cool
5.0,Dress fits as expected! I like it. Its not too long. I ordered a Large! Its fine! It hides my stomach. Lol. I would recommend and I would definitely be ordering again in a different color. I like that the material isn‚Äôt the kind that fades after u wash it a few times too!
5.0,Bought 7 for Christmas gifts. Everyone loved them
5.0,These are the only socks that Charles will wear. They're safe and comfortable.
5.0,My son wears Everytime it rains
5.0,"How cute is this bag?! I recently bought a set of ""green bags"" from this manufacturer but ended up giving most of them away, because my friends liked them so much. When I saw this one, I couldn't resist - mostly, because we had a Bernese Mountain Dog in the past, and now we have a Pug and a Jack Russell mix. The only one missing is a lab ;-)"
5.0,Very pretty. Not flimsy. Nice gift
5.0,Well you know I should be like mr conductor from shining time station that way I could tell Thomas stories or raging Amish episode in black ops or mw3
5.0,This is the wallet I've been looking for. It's got space for everything I need and nothing more. It's stylish and compact. I look forward to using it for a while.
5.0,Great price and fast shipping! :)
5.0,Perfect little dress for any occasion. Bright and beautiful lace.
5.0,Is so pretty!
5.0,"Great fit and very comfortable.<br /><br />I put on a pair of thick socks and off to fight The Chicago Winter Weather I go.<br /><br />The boot itself, is lightweight, which I love!<br /><br />Great quality making a happy purchase."

5.0,These are great under $10 value. Nice dark lenses. Comfortable fit & don‚Äôt pull hair.
5.0,beautiful and soft; perfect for my weirdly-situated-in-the-building office that has wonky temperature fluctuations
5.0,"Love the color and it smells of leather. The metal is more dull than I expected, but still love it and get compliments. I'm a fit guy and it's kind of tight at first, but it broke in and fits just fine on the tightest snaps. The snaps work great too. Doesn't take much effort to snap or unsnap after a couple of days use. That's the only issue, as sometimes it comes off if I hit a door or something with it. But, still happy with the purchase."
5.0,The outfit fit well and was made nicely. My daughter looked great! I was able to wash out the cake stains and it's still in great condition.
5.0,"Nice and light weight, the fit is great. my recommendation is to get one size up from the shirt size you normally wear(if you where any kind of pads underneath.  it didn't arrive when i had paid for it to but amazon(or the seller, one of them) refunded that cost."
5.0,"Wanted baggy and got it. Check the size and choose what fits like a shirt. Despite it being too big, I like the flexibility with outfits"
5.0,"Great design, buckle is a little tight."
5.0,"We went to Seattle Olympic state park used this backpack and did realized that this was a perfect addition for hiking. This backpack was great for my family of three. It is super lightweight fabric and has zero form to it which has the bonus of you can shove quite a bit into it! There are so many pockets for different items. I had a toddler so we had fit in with clothes for 2 adults, toddler's jackets, diapers, plus some snacks. it still has plenty of room after all.  it is also waterproof that does help us one day when it rained here in Seattle. all of the food and clothes did not get wet. Overall,  I am happy with this purchase as I will start to use this more often now during summer time hiking with my lovely family."
5.0,My son loved them! He wore them at his Mario themed swim party :)
5.0,A gift for my 13 year old niece.  She loves it.  It went right on her wrist and it is still there!
5.0,Perfect for that pushup to wear under bralettes
5.0,I love these pants. I wear them when hiking and they are perfect for now. They are thick enough to buffer so that I am not being poked in the woods. Will order more.
5.0,"Super surprised by this band. It‚Äôs extremely comfortable and secure feeling. The price is so cheap, but the quality is great! I paid close to $40 for another band that doesn‚Äôt come close to the quality and value of this one.<br />Also, something I didn‚Äôt see mentioned in other reviews: the end pieces have 2 grooves that fit into the holes, for extra hold, which also means they don‚Äôt slide back and forth constantly. My expensive band did that and it drove me crazy. (See picture)"
5.0,Very cozy!
5.0,I'm 5'2 and 105 pounds and they fit really well. They are a little long and a smidgen baggy in the crotch area (I expected that) so I just roll the waist and it fixes!  :3
5.0,Comfortable dress. Wore it to a wedding.
5.0,They fit perfect and provide my hands with much needed protection but still make detailed tasks possible.
5.0,"Great skorts, good quality and fit great"

5.0,Dainty and cute perfect for a tween.
5.0,"Love this dress!  So glad I listened to other reviewers.  It runs a little small so I ordered one size up and it was perfect!  I normally wear a size 12 in women's dresses, but ordered an XL in this dress."

5.0,"I was iffy about buying this bag, but as soon as it came in the mail I fell in love! It's great quality, and the size is perfect!"
5.0,"Very cute for workout tank. Was going to spend $50 plus on an Alo tank and this looks just as good! Could be worn for other things, but I use over my sports bra for exercise. Great buy!"
5.0,I am absolutely amazed at the quality. Then border detail is perfect. The fit is everything that I would write in this kind of style. I would absolutely purchase again.
5.0,"These are really great.  I use two in my purse - one for receipts, one for coupons.  The magnets work very well; they not only close the envelope, but keep the envelope together. Pleased with my purchase - EXCEPT I was sent PINK instead of RED shown in the picture.  I already didn't like the pale blue one, now I have two I don't like.  Love all the other colors, but I particularly wanted the red.  Was disappointed to receive pink instead of red."
5.0,I really like it. It is inexpensive and wears well. I put it on my daughter and she looked so cute in it I went back to buy more.<br />It runs a bit small in my opinion. My daughter usually wears 6-9 months/ 9-12 months depending on the brand and this 12-18 month fit her perfect.
5.0,These are so nice esp for the price!<br />Very lovely.<br />Better than some I've seen for more $$.
5.0,I got this for my 6 year old son for protection he his old one got broken and I got him this one I hope this well last for a long run üôÇüôÇ
5.0,She loved the gift!! Thank you
5.0,"I wore this to a wedding in Mexico and I was pleased. Fit great. I am 5' 2"" and weigh 200 lbs. The top was flattering because I am pretty flat chested. I got a lot of compliments."
5.0,"I'm not usually a fan of sports bras that don't clip in the back, because untangling from a sweat bra can be a real tough time, but these bras are lit! Have had them for over 6 months and reach for them over other bras. Soooo comfy, wash well and can handle a ton of sweat without making me feel super nasty. The price is so good too!"
5.0,"This is a very nice wig. It is not overly-shiny to the point were it looks fake. I am only going to have to doctor it a little bit. My only critique is that you will have to cut your own bangs, and if you are not comfortable doing that then you should probably get a different product. When I ordered this, I though the bangs would come cut as shown, but they did not.<br /><br />I showed it off to some of my friends and they absolutely adored it! I was a bit scared to purchase this, but Love it. Just make sure you are able to take good care of it ^-^"
5.0,This is the cutest outfit.  It is very well made.
5.0,very beautiful - looks exactly like picture and great customer service!! I bought it in 2 colors and will always buy from this seller because they helped tremendously with a small issue I had with the earring. I totally recommend
5.0,Better than I expected. I ordered the smallest size of 3 months and used on my 9lb newborn baby for his newborn photo shoot. It was a bit large but I expected that. Material was soft and stretchy. We received so many compliments on this! Great purchase
5.0,"I use the barometer as a station pressure monitor for long range shooting. It jives with my weathflow meter within  a hundredth of a inHg.  Compass seems very accurate as compared to my lensatic and phone compass. Altimeter, as always, is based on station pressure, so you need to know your absolute altitude for start of the day, set it, then unless barometrics change drastically, the alt. will be semi-accurate.  I posted a pic of the wrist band length for anyone who might find that helpful. The light is very bright which is a good thing. Also it stays on ""H"" for the charge so far. I'm outside only a limited amount of time, but it seems to keep the high charge.  The Sunset/Sunrise is based on your long and lat. so you have to program that in in order for that work properly, but that was easy and so far it's on the money.  Alarms are loud enough to hear even in a shop with a vac or drill press going. I contacted Casio about static damage (I had the  EAW-SGW-300H-1AV watch (twice, once replaced under warranty from casio). This was due to winter conditions in Tennessee, dry weather and taking off a fleece jacket generated static and killed the two watches (I know, after the first time you would have thought I would be more careful, but I forgot and did it again). WIth this watch costing so much more, I'm being very careful with the static problem.  Casio did not confirm it was a problem, but did tell me they never had any issues with this watch and static damage. Read into that what you will. So the cheaper casio may have static issues, I don't know. But two times for me I killed one, so I would be careful with static.<br /><br />Watch is lightweight and looks good. I have average wrists, I don't think it looks too big. But I have always worn military watches, so I would not care if it was too big looking. Function rules.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
5.0,Very comfortable to wear get compliments every time
5.0,Loved this Fascinator.
5.0,"So comfy! Light and soft. The fabric looks just like the listing photo. Only dislike is the button closure. I mean really! Gotta potty or time to pull the jumpsuit back up‚Äîthe button is impossible. I have a jumpsuit of similar fabric that has the collar of a leotard (all stretch and no button). I just leave the button undone and tuck the flaps inside. My long hair hides it. Otherwise, love it."
5.0,Love! So many complements wearing this and it is so comfy!
5.0,I loved his hat it is so warm and fuzzy. It is my my favorite hat! I loved it so much I bought my boyfriend one
5.0,"This is the most beautiful jewelry I have ever had the pleasure of purchasing from any retailer.  The quality, workmanship, and authenticity exceed my expectations.  I cannot find another reason to purchase my silver jewelry from any other retailer and I won't. Others simply pale in comparison.  No doubt there are other customers who share my opinion. I especially enjoy their filigree collection of sterling silver earrings, but all of their collections are beautiful.  More, more, more!"
5.0,"These shorts are very soft, cover well and feel good!  Ordered 3 pair!!"
5.0,A gift for my daughter and she loves it.  Wears it every chance she gets.
5.0,Me encanta son bellas y no molestan
5.0,These were bought my husband. He really enjoys them and found them to be very comfortable.
5.0,"My kiddo loves these scarves. They are thin, but I think they work great to add a layer to keep the cold wind off of your neck. They also fit an adult as well, a little snug, but if there‚Äôs a color your kiddo doesn‚Äôt want, you can wear it."
5.0,"Used this for a photoshoot recently, very lovely item. I'm so used to these shawls falling apart and being cheap but it's a rather sturdy product. And very comfortable"
5.0,"This shirt runs small so, buy 1 size up. Otherwise, my twins loved them."
5.0,This makes a great carry-on bag for short trips.
5.0,"My daughter wore this to her first 8th grade formal.  It was perfect, fit well, and the pockets were such a bonus for a teen girl needing a place for her phone and money without the hassle of carrying a purse."
5.0,In the future I will only purchase these inserts direct from Danner Shoes. They charge less and give better service on this type of item.
5.0,good little crossbody to carry essentials
5.0,She loved it!
5.0,Great product that my 3 year old loves!
5.0,I bought this to have something comfortable and pretty.  I measured myself and used their chart to get the correct size.  I am pretty happy with this dress.  I will probably soon order one of these again in a different design.
5.0,This product is amazing
5.0,my baby comes on the small side so i bought her the 6-9months and it fit as i expected. the sock thing was a little but tight but was manageable. overall okay quality for just a day. i would recommend

5.0,"I've always found Cate & Chloe to be an accessory line that beautifully lines up with my own tastes in jewelry. I love their classic designs with a fresh flair. Their jewelry is well-made, and I love the little white Cate & Chloe gift boxes with a magnetized front closure. These emerald crystal earrings are already a well-loved addition to my jewelry collection!<br /><br />These simulated emerald crystal studs are rounded and highly faceted, so that lovely shades of green glisten and sparkle. This stone is set into a circlet of tiny round CZs, which also have a nice shine and sparkle. They're attached to white gold-plated studs with scroll backs. They're easy to place in the ears. And they are so beautiful! Although the width of the earrings is only 8 mm, they look so elegant on. Perfect for a night or luncheon out. Beautiful!"
5.0,"Excellent comfy dress. Great fabric and style.<br />Can dress up with a jacket, vest, and some jewelry."
5.0,Great work out shirt!
5.0,Very pretty. Pefect gift for a Percy Jackson fan.

5.0,It works!!! It really works!!! She just disappeared!!! Well worth every penny.
5.0,"I once read that criminals with access to your keys can copy your house key and get your address from your registration and rob you later.  So as a rule, when I have to leave my car keys with someone (car wash, oil change place, etc.) I don't leave my house key or other keys with them.  I also keep a USB drive and a USB key (needed to access my most secure sites such as my password manager and my home network) on my key ring.  I got this key chain to make it easy to quickly remove and re-add keys and my USB devices.  Plus it looks really good and isn't real bulky."
5.0,These look good on me and all my friends look good trying them on. I went back and bought 4 pairs so when these get scratched and worn I can open a new pair. Best bet
5.0,The first order i received was missing the diamond brush and the cleaning solution leaked out into the package. Amazon was quick to send another one out and I received the diamknd brush and a non leaking cleaning solution . very happy with my purchase

5.0,quick ship great product
5.0,"Fit better than expected. Soft, beautiful, exquistite."
5.0,Really pretty bracelet and nice quality considering it's weight. Ally he beads are vibrant and look good with my other bracelets
5.0,I LOVE these leggings! They are so comfortable and don‚Äôt slip down all day. They fit perfectly and they‚Äôre very stretchy so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about ordering a size too small. The material is very high quality and feels thicker than any pair I‚Äôve bought at this price. I always get compliments when I wear these out for athleisure and when I work out.
5.0,These hose met my needs and expectations. I used them for international travel.
5.0,Bargain!!!
5.0,Just received  this bracelet and it is perfect! As a lover of texture I love this one it has a natural look and it's not stiff but soft as if I have worn it for a long time. Perfect!
5.0,a gift for my niece who's headed off to dental school - she loves it!
5.0,Love love love this swimsuit!!! I am 5&#34;4 115 lbs 32c bra and the size small fits perfect! I ordered size Medium and size small to try them both on. I took a photo of it in size Medium and you can tell the bottoms are too loose so I sold it to my girlfriend and kept the size small.
5.0,I ordered the smaller size (1-3 years) for my 4 year old.  She's in a size 8 shoe and the socks fit great with some room for her to grow.  She wore them for family pictures.  I'll add a photo once we get them back.
5.0,"Very cute and well made dress.  However, looks terrible on me.  I am 5'7, 180 lbs, and have 3 young kids.  My body just isnt ready for this yet if ever.  It made me look pregnant with the waist as high as it is, and pleats at the top of the skirt you cant see in the picture.  If your tummy area is well under control, it will look great."
5.0,Looks just fine
5.0,The hat and gloves are so Mario. My grandson loves the hat and gloves.
5.0,"I read the reviews on this item before ordering and they were mostly right.  This dress is of a quality fabric and does not look cheaply made.  It has such a unique and flattering style, which I love.  My only dilemma is whether to keep the medium or the large - I ordered both - and  each has its pros.  The medium hugs my curves and would probably be viewed as a sexier fit. However, the large is roomier, obviously, and requires less tugging after sitting, standing, etc.  I will definitely be keeping one of them because I love the dress.  I purchased it to wear at my daughter's rehearsal dinner, the night before her wedding, and she loves it too!"
5.0,"I like this sweatshirt a lot, specifically for the gym. I throw it over my tank top and leggings for the cool mornings and my warm up. It‚Äôs not too thick or heavy. I‚Äôve washed it a few times, it hasn‚Äôt frayed or done anything weird. But the bottom and neck are a raw hem so they do roll up."
5.0,Love the fit and feel.
5.0,"Fabric is good quality, not see thru, fits well stretchy and very comfortable"
5.0,The comfort and the design on the mask.
5.0,I bought the green dress and it's beautiful! It runs true to size. I'm 5'2&#34; and will not need to hem the dress. I ordered the red one because the dress was a great value. You need to wear the belt or some type of belt with the dress to give it shape.
5.0,The material is soft and comfortable just a bit long.  But I hemmed it and it now perfect<br />The dress is a good buy
5.0,Great sturdy rain boots that are too stinking cute :)
5.0,She absolutely loves them.Can't go wrong for price.Great quality perfect fit.
5.0,Got this to replace my old red fabric Trader Joe‚Äôs bag that I misplaced. Love it because I can throw it over my shoulder after loading it up and walk home
5.0,Had to hike downhill and uphill some large valleys And these are one of the best purchases I made all year I recommend these. Super lightweight foldable and good quality.
5.0,These sleeves are comfortable and sleek. There are no individual finger openings- one opening for whole hand- fingerless
5.0,"Bought a pair as gift for my husband, feels soft inside, fit as expected."
5.0,Wonderful necklace can be worn with so many different outfits
5.0,Beautiful color and fit! Great workout shirt
5.0,"I love these so much, they are so comfortable"
5.0,"I love this thing. NO more tangled cables and fishing for accessories in my laptop bag!<br />However, I must say the board kinda bends after a few months of use. Nothing to worry about though. I think it's normal because you're putting devices between strong elastic bands, which run from one end of the board to the other causing the board to bend upwards."
5.0,"beautiful colors, well fitting and great details, like the tassels to tie up the top."
5.0,nice will by again
5.0,I'm 5'0 and weighs 108lbs. I got a medium size and I loved how it fits! the dress was comfortable to use too. Im giving it 5stars!
5.0,I like my glasses they fit good over My glasses
5.0,Love it. I saw it on a friend and bought it. Comfortable and a good fit.
5.0,"Whether it is for work, church, school or dining out, this dress has you covered. Made of a 50/45/5 blend of cotton, polyester and spandex, it is easy to get on and off.  Available in 5 different sizes, this dress comes below the knees and is comfortable to wear and sexy looking too.<br /><br />Machine or hand wash on cold. DO NOT USE A DRYER. Hang it up to dry. There can be some slight discoloration on the first wash, so wash it separately from other clothes the first time. My wife line dries most of her stuff, and this came out extra soft, and did NOT wrinkle up.<br /><br />It is available in 5 sizes and 3 colors, so you can mix and match with many blouses or other wearables.<br /><br />Well constructed with no stitching flaws at all, this Moyabo dress can become an essential part of your wardrobe.<br /><br />Recommended buy."
5.0,Liked it. But not thick enough to keel germs out

5.0,Ordered 2 for different ceremonies.
5.0,"These work fine, you just can't walk on sharp things with them. They're exactly what you'd expect."
5.0,Very sharp hat that that feels good.  The fit is more old-school which I like and is more comfortable. My new bourbon drinking hat.
5.0,Very sharp jacket. The packaging and shipping was great. To give you an idea on how it fit. I'm 5'9 175lbs and usually a 40R jacket and the  XL fit perfect.
5.0,Love it.  You must wear a slip underneath and a camisol. Fits great though.
5.0,"Super cute, and comfortable! I usually wear a 7.5, but ill get an 8 in boots (I like thick socks in the winter). I ordered these in a 7.5 and they fit perfectly! There's enough wiggle room to wear reg thickness socks with them, and they are comfortable to walk around in. Granted, I haven't walked far in them (where am I gonna go? There's a pandemic right now lol) but will update if I do and there's a problem . All in all, so far so great!"
5.0,"Very cute! Super-affordable, and perfect for Fall, October, Halloween."

5.0,Glasses are very sturdy and nice. As you look through them it‚Äôs very clear.
5.0,"exactly what I wanted! I got these to wear in the hospital, and they worked perfectly. They did not slip on the floors, and were comfortable enough to sleep in. Will order more if these wear out."
5.0,This was perfect for my son. He shared that it is very comfortable and cool. He wears it when performing hip hop and finds the the fit and material to be perfect for his needs.
5.0,Love love love love love it ... so far this is the best dress I‚Äôve ever had
5.0,This is very cute on the only think I dislike about this dress is the slip underneath makes it a bit awkward other that very cute
5.0,"One of my husband's fave tennis hat.  Very light weight, beautiful colors and the sweat doesn't leave white marks when it dries!"
5.0,My 8 yr old son loves these. They fit well and are nice pjs.
5.0,Simply amazing and SO soft. I'm on my way to order another one! These run just a tad in the large side. Order a size down if you like you're clothes fitted. Otherwise these are true to size (:
5.0,"This is a very solid belt, for a cloth one anyway. It hold extremely well and doesn't slide like some of the rounded Double D ring style belts might. Easy to adjust tightness, I am very happy with this one and wish this exact model came in other colors."
5.0,I ordered the khaki color but I got a grey color. But the quality of the shirt is great.
5.0,Love this cuff
5.0,Love this dress so comfy. Wore Easter Sunday to church.
5.0,"The shirt was alittle long but otherwise the material was soft, washed up nice and loved the color I picked."
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter and she loved them.  Fit her perfectly.
5.0,I have this shirt in purple and black and will definitely be ordering more. It‚Äôs so soft. The material is breathable and the slides aren‚Äôt too deep.
5.0,This belt is not a friction fit belt it has small teeth at the end of the belt that ensures the belt will not slip.
5.0,"I like them. I have 15 inch calves and ordered size Large pattern B. They were not hard to get on. They look nice and my son even complimented them. However, I've only had them on 30 minutes so I don't know how I'll feel in an hour or two. I drive for a living and have developed varicose veins/venous insufficiency so I'm really hoping these help. I have trouble with my left leg, it tends to feel pain with compression sleeves so I'm hoping that doesn't happen. This is a great value for the money. I have not felt the need to cut the lower band off, however I'm open to it if I feel it necessary. (There really shouldn't be a band at the bottom) All my patterns and colors are as shown in the photos and they look nice and will go well with my summer clothes. I would not be able to wear tighter sleeves. These are mild 12-14 mm/Hg and tight enough in my opinion. Comfortable when I walk. I'm happy with my purchase and will update after a full work day of driving.<br /><br />Update: I wore them for a full day of driving yesterday ( about 6-7 hours) and all the way until it was time for bed! I had a few areas of discomfort in my left leg after a a couple hours that only lasted for a few seconds and I was nearly going to take them off, I'm glad I didn't ...that went away and my legs felt fine the whole rest of the day...no pain whatsoever and no pain in my feet..I was so amazed! My legs felt so much better than without them I didn't want to take them off! And I have them on right now, first thing this morning. If this keeps up I'm going to buy more! BTW, I did have to cut the lower band off the left one yesterday morning, it was cutting my circulation off. There were a few threads but didn't unravel, I just snipped them off carefully. My left calf is bigger than my right (15 1/2) but I think an extra large will be too big. So that's what worked for me. Measure your calves with a tape measure, refer to the size chart in the item description, and give them a try! :)"
5.0,"Very cute dress and nice quality for the price. I was afraid it would be too short, since I often have that problem with dresses, but the length is perfect. I'm 5'6&#34; and it hits just above the knee on me. its a really nice cut if you're curvy, but probably not what you're looking for if you don't want to show cleavage."
5.0,"High end looking ,glasses fits well ."

5.0,Excelente !!!
5.0,"My daughter really loved these and are her favorite for school.  She will likely get more from this brand since they do offer other styles, but these are the best ones in my opinion."
5.0,Soft and pliable.  Fits perfectly
5.0,I bought these for my wife for part of her Xmas gift. She loves them. They are very soft.

5.0,"I‚Äôll be able to wear this scarf on into the spring, because the colors are soft and light. The look and feel as well as the quality seem to be in line with the supplier‚Äôs description... 100% cashmere, made in Scotland."

5.0,This dress is so beautiful.. Perfect
5.0,"I got 2 Bracelets from this brand. Quality is very good and price is low (Original Bracelets will cost $45 or more), but.......you may have to file it to fit your specific watch. The Bracelet was very little bit on the bigger side , so if you are a good handyman and  know how to use a 'fine toothed' File, then go ahead and buy it, which I did. I am a watch collector and have few watches and have changed lot of bands over time. Please be aware only the ORIGINAL one will fit perfectly in this design configuration (Curved Ends)."
5.0,I live this dress! Fits well. Just like picture. Super cute on with a blue cardigan!

5.0,My cousin love her bracelet
5.0,"I have bought tons of slippers‚Ä¶.so far these are the only ones that no matter how sore my feet are, my feet  never feel  they tired. I walk around my house whole day with them. You never will feel tired. It‚Äôs worth to buy them.<br />Be aware you can‚Äôt wash them like most of the slippers. Well these do not get even dirty üòú.<br />Wear socks to keep the sweat away. I read other reviews saying you slipped and fall, the bottom it‚Äôs like most of the slippers are, so if you walk on slippery area who won‚Äôt fall ‚Ä¶?ü§ì<br />They  are Not slippery though  .üëçüèº"
5.0,Got them as a present for my roommate - he loooved them!
5.0,"Being in the unfortunate situation of losing a valuable and sentimental pin at Disney World I can tell you that these Pin Keepers are invaluable.  They are very easy to apply and with a few turns of key, these will ensure you are never put into that same position of looking all over for a lost pin that can't be replaced.  I highly recommend these for keeping those valuable pins safe."
5.0,"I was hesitant to order this because at the time it had no reviews.  It looks amazing, and no, it does NOT shut down in the middle of the night as the one star review suggests, UNLESS you aren't familiar with automatic watches.  You'll want to put it on a watch winder, since automatic watches are charged based on your movement. Otherwise, if you aren't wearing it every day or if you aren't active enough, it'll die at night when it's not moving.  This is not a product defect, just the design of automatic watches.<br /><br />I love it though, I really expected something much lower quality for the price.  Highly recommend"
5.0,was looking for this wallet for the longest finally found it... came out as I wanted it.
5.0,"Replacing DW-6900 from 1994 (purchased at Service Merchandise). Size and fit as expected. My greatest concern when I received this watch was it's  authenticity. It's obvious the packaging was not correct (picture shows a box for Casio C-PMGH2-1). This did not come in a tin box with an booklet manual (squared or flat binding). The instructions were in Japanese. The pictures were the same as the English instructions found online. I suppose it's legit. One of the 2 tags that was on the watch itself was correct and the other was not (for GW-6900). Not sure where it's made. I would suspect China. The stainless steel back is made in Thailand, as it it stamped on the back. Batch number 302A085I on the back indicates it was manufactured in Thailand (302A) on March 26 (085=85th day of the year), 2019 (""I"" 2009 or 2019. Thailand factory commenced production and shipment in 2012, therefore 2019). I did some research and everything I've seen indicates this particular watch is authentic. Everything from double metal buckle, lettering under mineral crystal, to functionality tells me it's real. I don't believe anyone would go through this much trouble to manufacture such a fantastic fake for a less than $200 watch. Not sure if this one was a return or not but it was sold as ""New.""<br /><br />I purchased from Premium-Japan. I ordered it on Tuesday August 13 (night) and received it around 1:30pm Saturday August 17. Tokyo to Nashville in 3-4 days. I did pay $20 extra for expedited shipping ($197 total). With the speedy delivery and the quality of the watch I am overlooking the issue with the wrong boxes and tag. It's not like I'm buying a Rolex.<br /><br />I added JaysAndKays Bullbar ($11 from the other ""e""-normous auction site) and 5 pk screen protector for $11 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DHSQV57/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Bullbar was super fast delivery.<br /><br />Btw, I have a 7.5"" wrist and fits great. Doesn't move, not loose or too tight. The watch looks bigger than it does in the picture (Tabasco is just for reference).<br /><br />Cons: Others have complained about the screen fogging. Seems like it's an issue with this particular model. I've read somewhere online it may be the stock gasket. Oh well, we'll see. The light isn't very bright. I suppose every time you look at your watch you wouldn't want a too bright ""auto electro-luminescent"" light.<br /><br />So far, great watch. I highly recommend it."
5.0,"My 5 year old loves these boots. He wears a size 1 in kids and these fit more like a 3, but he can still wear them laced up tight and will be able to grow into them. Great quality!"

5.0,"I was apprehensive buying these since the it seemed too good to be true but they are great quality and very beautiful. I've been at 2 for 4 years now and dont plan on going any bigger. I've never had a larger variety of plugs before since they're usually quite expensive. I'm glad I added these to the collection. They fit right in with no difficulties, I usually dont like flares since my last pair I nearly couldn't get out but the flare on these is just big enough they seem snug but not painful to put in. I haven't worn them long enough to see if there will be any falling out issues but will update if so. Overall, fast shipping good quality, organized packaging, and just a damn good deal."
5.0,Loved it!! This dresss is very comfortable and pretty!!<br />Fits loose but not huge!!<br />Would have preferred sleeves to be a little longer but not an issue.
5.0,I love this and hope that my mother will also.
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter for a recital. As fellow parents are aware of, she was able to wear them twice before she outgrew them. They were comfortable and looked very nice on her. She was wearing a dress, the shoes looked great. You can dress them up and down. I recommend."
5.0,"I have had my nose pin for several months now, and it still looks as good as new. It is beautiful and shiny and I like that the design is so unique compared to a plain stud or jewel that most people have. I plan to purchase more of these in different styles in the future!"

5.0,I got two of the chunky buttery fleece and two of the tighter weave fleece and both were great I wore the pink one and it was very cute as it squeezed out of my helmet. My teenagers didn‚Äôt like the big chunky look but they wore the balaclavas over their helmet and they were great in 0¬∞.
5.0,These were great. I bought them as graduation gifts for my daughter's friends. They loved them
5.0,"While I was searching for yoga type pants I came across this amazing looking ‚ÄúDay of the Dead‚Äù spandex suit. My daughter attends the ‚ÄúDay of the Dead‚Äù festival every year. So when I saw this, I just had to get it for her.<br /><br />As you can see, she LOVES it & is already preparing her makeup to match. The size fit as expected. Doesn‚Äôt seem to show our little womanly imperfections when wearing spandex type material. Always a good thing;)<br /><br />I‚Äôm hoping to be able to attend the ‚ÄúDay of the Dead‚Äù festival with my daughter. I love the design my daughter chose, so I‚Äôm having a difficult time deciding if we should be twins, or if I should purchase a different design/color. Decisions, decisions."

5.0,"In response to the poor review I gave, this company is sending me a full refund. They also said they would work on the construction of the garment, so that it would be better quality, in the future. Maybe I will try again sometime later.<br /><br /> Upper sleeves are a bit tight and they don't taper down. So at the wrists, they are way too big and don't fit well for use with the thumb slits. Front is much shorter than it looks in the picture. Overall, it is not well put together,  which is a shame, because I was really looking forward to wearing it this fall."
5.0,Lovely little red shoes!
5.0,"These oversized glasses look a little retro but super stylish. They are a bit heavy but not so much that they leave marks or are too heavy to wear. They do a fantastic job of blocking the sun! They are thick, well made and the frame is sturdy. Plus they come with a hard case and a cloth for cleaning which is a bonus! I would highly recommend!"

5.0,"Fit just like  it looks! This piece is sure to dazzle anyone you come across and keep you sexy at the same time! It sure says &#34;BAM, I'm Fabulous!&#34; When you walk in. It's made of a stretchy quality, and has a bunch of scale like holes going throughout it. It's going to be perfect for raves, Halloween, and festivals! I was actually surprised as to how comfortable it fit and how good it actually looked when you put it on! I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest amazon review and I have taken my time to do so."
5.0,"Huge roomy shirt, bought as a gift.  Nice soft material."
5.0,"My daughter loved her birthday gift. It was perfect, the only compliaint is that I wish I could adjust it."
5.0,"I was recently in charge of organizing a bachelor party and I was looking for something that all the attendees could wear for the night of celebration.  Originally I thought about making t-shirts but figured not many people would want to put a t-shirt over their collard shirt.<br /><br />I figured a silicone wristband was my best bet. Something everyone could wear to identify us but not something too obnoxious that some would opt out wearing. I searched around the web and there are several resources out there that supply 'wristbands' and even offer services to customize them.  However, due to price, wait time, and minimum quantity purchase (in most cases 50 and some 100) to get custom wristbands it just wasn't an option.<br /><br />I came across these wristbands and even though the shipping wasn't free, they turned out to be the best deal. I purchased 24 black wristbands and the cost ended up being around 0.64 per band including shipping.<br /><br />I then purchased one of those white 'paint' markers and wrote my own message on each band to make them more appropriate for the event. Not as fancy as getting them debossed with a message but since they'll only be worn for one night I didn't loose any sleep over it.<br /><br />As for the product itself, they seem just as durable and quality as the yellow ""live strong"" bands that made them so popular. I would definitely recommend these wristbands if you are in a similar situation I was in or if you just want to a bunch of blank wristbands for whatever purpose."
5.0,Very soft material and good fit for curvy girl
5.0,I got this necklace for my daughter; she is a huge Taylor Swift fan and she loves it! It's great quality and very pretty.
5.0,Super cute! Looks just like the pictures.
5.0,"This is a great shirt to have when pregnant.  You can wear it after giving birth too so it's not a waste of money.  Material is soft and decently thick.  For work you can wear it over a regular shirt with collars.  Many compliments on this... Love it!<br />Way too short to wear as a dress though, need leggings or skinny pants under it unless you want to look like you are in a certain &#34;profession&#34;."
5.0,"Great bag, very strong straps and goes well across the chest. Also has many pockets and convenient to carry around places."
5.0,"I sized up to a large, shouldn't have a medium would have been perfect with it being oversized but you never know for sure until you get it in, I will still keep it, it's great! And I will be getting more colors in medium this time."
5.0,I ordered these to replace a pair of the same style and color Okabashis that I have had for over 6 years. I wore my previous pair almost everyday during the spring and summer seasons. Finally they started to crack on one side but I couldn't believe how long they lasted as the life expectancy of Oskabashi shoes are estimated as being considerably less than the 6 years I had with them. I suffer from plantar fasciitis and these shoes make my work days on my feet much more comfortable. This particular shoe is quite stylish and can be worn as both a causal and dress shoe. I really love these and highly recommend them.
5.0,"I got these for my boyfriends son who is an avid gamer.<br />The socks are cute, and the quality seems to be good."

5.0,Very comfortable and a great look!
5.0,"The style is exactly what I was looking for. It is an all-match and must-have shirt, so I can wear it to create different styles. I have to give it a five-star because the texture of the martial is surprisingly soft and silky."

5.0,Color and quality was very good.
5.0,"Absolutely adorable !<br />Whoever came up with  the idea of it , is a generous :) . I love how it looks and feels, perfect for vacation . The only advice I can give , if you are above US size 8 , have large breasts , and not so slim arms,  it may be  too tight and the straps will bother you.  I'm size 8 and I wish it was a bit looser on me , but I can totally use it ."

5.0,So flattering and such good quality. The wrap snatches your waist to the Gods and hides the stomach pooch. I‚Äôm gunna go broke cause I‚Äôm buying this dress in every color.
5.0,These are great glasses. Fit well.  Don't darken things too much.  And do a great job at protecting your eyes.  My only complaint is they make your skin look a little lighter so before you notice it you get a wicked sunburn.

5.0,Looks very cheaply made. Not like you'd expect fake flowers to look. But Very sturdy
5.0,"I still cannot believe I bought these, oof what a first-world problem<br /><br />That being said, they work perfectly & feel sexy like stocking garters ‚ô° No springing open of the grips or otherwise sliding off or ""letting go"" of the shirt during a day at the office, A+<br /><br />Note: I do NOT know how effective these are under pants, as far as showing lines or feeling uncomfortable at overlapping seam points, because I've only worn them under pleated or A-line skirts that have plenty of room."
5.0,"I love this collection, and this tie in particular. It actually looks better in person. Tie has a nice quality feel and weight to it, and ties and dimples well.  Love the colors and will be adding more Scott Allan to my collection"

Very cute, good stretch, and a nice cotton blend. It was wrinkly when I took the pictures, but steaming does the trick. Also, there are spots on my mirror, not the shirt. Very good quality, and I would buy it in different styles/colors/patterns if more became available."
5.0,I ordered these to change into after my wedding and they were great. But what I liked best was the customer service. The deliver date was the weekend of my wedding and I asked if they could ship it any sooner and they shipped the next day. I was so appreciative of quick response and the willingness to help me out. Overall great experience with the product and customer service. Thanks again!
5.0,"It‚Äôs a pretty standard cosplay quality wig. It is a little more blue/teal than green like it shows in the picture, but my daughter was happy with it. It‚Äôs thick and covers hair hair/wig cap well. It‚Äôs not overly shiny or cheap looking."

5.0,Absolutely loves this item. I originally saw an almost identical piece on Revolve for more than triple the price. Found this on Amazon and took a leap. So glad I did. So many compliments on the unique design and how it fit. I am 5‚Äô1 about 100 lbs and I have struggle to find dresses that fit me and don‚Äôt make me look like a little girl playing dress up. This was not the case at all with this piece. Thank you Amazon for this cute and affordable look!
5.0,Besutiful
5.0,"I was so tired of my husband's pullover sweater vests...thought this would look snazzy and I was right.  The buttons are understated and the V of the sweater is lower than pullovers so more of the shirt and tie is seen.  Really takes his office style up a notch.  The vest material is not thick and if cold is a concern, maybe sticking with a chunky pullover vest would be best.  However, the light weight of the vest is in it's favor if worn with a suit jacket.  It worked out so well that I bought him.another."
5.0,The lights all worked well. One of them had an issue with the elastic strap but we made it work.  The guys all had fun with them.  Take pictures with your live setting and watch them blink.  So fun.
5.0,"This is a very cute set to share with your ""person""! I'm excited to gift this to my Thelma."

5.0,"Really love this! Its flowy, long and very light fabric. I am 5'7 and ordered a medium."
5.0,"This small discrete ""wallet"" stretches comfortably around one's calf - excellent solution now that Eagle Creek no longer makes their undercover leg wallet."
5.0,I love these gloves. They look and feel great. I bought 2 more pairs for Christmas gifts. For the price they're much better than I expected.
5.0,"I bought these bags as gift bags for a birthday party. I added a few treats in them, and the ladies loved it. The bags have nice size handles to put over your shoulder, and are sturdy enough for groceries."
5.0,"I was SHOCKED! Beautifully made, very wearable, comfortable, but, ring size ALMOST was an issue. I didn't think about that, and I'm not sure if it said what size(s) it comes in. The only con I have, it took a long time to get to me with regular shipping. Buy it, it's beautiful, and the price? Come on!!!!  ; )"
5.0,"I wouldn't call these stretchy, but you shouldn't want stretch in your belt anyway. These are fantastic and well worth the price! The plastic buckle has been great so far through about a month! Just buy them--seriously! I got my 2 pack for about $8 on sale after tax! INCREDIBLE VALUE, and they're great for hiking pants!"
5.0,Item is great looking & I have received many compliments and it arrived early.
5.0,"I purchased the blouse for a Halloween costume, but it's so comfortable that I find myself pulling it out of the closet week after week. I think I'll be buying more of them."
5.0,"Super Cute, love this band. Still trying to figure out the clasp but honestly at this point I‚Äôve only worn it 2 times. Super fashionable and works with my Office attire!"
5.0,The material is fantastic and it fits great. The size guide is accurate for measurements.
5.0,I love these order one size up I have 4. Shows off just enough without feeling uncomfortable.
5.0,It is so hard to find pretty or fun sneakers for kids that don't light up (school uniform regulations). These sketchers are perfect! Extra bonus is that the colors match my daughter's backpack.
5.0,"I love these. They fit perfectly over my square glasses and are dark enough. Love they can flip up when I need to see something like my phone that is difficult with polarized glasses on. Hope they come back in stock, I want another pair when I misplace these."
5.0,Such a cute outfit.
5.0,Not sure where I am going to wear this yet for it is quite revealing but I will figure it out. I could just not pass it up since it is just so unique and amazing looking. I might wear this on a date in the city or a lounge. With the addition of spanx I think it would for me complete the look. I am not overly concerned with a little pouch having had a child so I would rock it either way. I weigh 185 and I am 5'4. 36 DDD if that helps.
5.0,"This bag is rather bluer than the picture makes it appear, but it is very pretty and like all the Deluxe Everyday bags is immensely practical when travelling."
5.0,I love this dress.  Very flattering
5.0,This was for my daughter and it fit her perfect. She said it was also very comfortable.
5.0,"Really pretty.  Flattering padded bra.  Good quality.  Panty is big, goes up to navel, but since the tankini is long anyway, it just provides extra tummy support.  Happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"I wear these shoes all day every day.  I had horrible knee pain and wearing these shoes ended the pain immediately.  I send them to friends and family.  With all the wearing inside and outside, they never change shape and show no wear- its been at least 2 months.  I will continue to get them for people as gifts and I will buy more pairs just for color variety."
5.0,"Exactly as pictured! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and about 140lbs. I ordered the medium navy and love it. Super comfortable, the weight of the material is nice. I tie up the front part of the dress to give it a little more character. It‚Äôs going to be perfect for summer"
5.0,Beautiful detail!
5.0,"These are my favorite pair of leggings I own. Similar to my gymshark ones but I actually prefer these ones. Squat proof, semi sweat proof, they make my legs look really good. They do have some threads coming loose on the seam on the inside but I wear and wash them constantly so it's to be expected I guess. I'll definitely order more soon."
5.0,Love them and they are very comfortable
5.0,"This dress was a big hit with my 10 year old! I wasn‚Äôt sure she‚Äôd like it with Justice being her favorite store, but she loved it! It‚Äôs well made and absolutely picture perfect cute!"
5.0,I was going to buy just one of these from another seller but I figured might as well pay a few extra dollars for all three. Nice and heavy and I love the chains that come with them. Great deal!
5.0,Best for growing toddler I use it on my 8 month old to help keep him clean during meal times works like a charm
5.0,"Purchased this for my daughter for Halloween.  It‚Äôs pretty inexpensive compared to some that are $50!  The wings are sturdy.  They‚Äôve lost a couple feathers, but it‚Äôs not noticeable.  The halo headband is cute."
5.0,Looks great and fits as expected!
5.0,Really like this dress. It is the perfect little black k dress!
5.0,"I'm blown away by the quality of these bras for the price! These are very similar to VS Bombshell bras, only better. I ordered the 6 pack in the basic color palette, 2 white, 2 black and 2 white. They all fit great but, the white fits me truest to size. The beige fits a bit tighter than the white and the black is slightly looser than the white. Nothing that adjusting the clasp can't fix."
5.0,True to size. This is a good set of comfy briefs. They are well stitched and the fabric is soft and breathable.
5.0,"I love these. They fit as expected, although I purchased a bigger size (they are big, but I don't care). I would say order your regular size. They keep me cooler and dry really fast. I have yet to have the &#34;damp&#34; when I wake up. I am purchasing another pair as we speak. Love them."
5.0,nice and light.
5.0,"The width of this belt slendarizes the waist it surrounds. Because it is so wide, I do not have a garment that has beltloops that size. I have to wear it without beltloops and place it where I think it fits and looks best. It is velvety and fancy."
5.0,I wore this scrub top for the  first time just a couple of days ago & love it ! Not only is it cute but super comfortable as well ! The residents at where I work  as well as several family members commented  on how cute the top was !
5.0,Love these!!! Keep my feet warm. I'd go a size up because they are a little snug. I will keep wearing to see if they stretch out
5.0,I needed a new key ring for my wife‚Äôs car. This was is very well constructed. Sturdy and looks awesome.
5.0,"Love this bag. Just what I wanted,  have received so many compliments."
5.0,Kids love being able to switch up their looks with these sunglasses. Must have for kids
5.0,"Got this baby on Saturday, strapped it up, put it on and off I went. I have to say, it looked fantastic being used and all..what a great deal. no tears or chips, everything as it should be. Felt comfortable on my head, chin strap felt good, no over tightness (The fit was near perfect) If you're looking for value and product quality, this little baby works!"
5.0,Comfortable. Good fit and right length.
5.0,"Warm and cozy, and my fingers still feel nimble--these gloves are comfortable and versatile; can dress up or down very nicely and are easy to care for.  I got the M/L size for my medium hands and the fit is fabulous.  Highly recommend these gloves!"
5.0,"These socks are great! They wear well, wash well. I would definitely buy them again!"
5.0,Perfect for summer. Lightweight I just love it!
5.0,LOVE these pjs! They‚Äôre soft and very comfortable. The color is a soft lilac that my pic doesn‚Äôt do justice to. I‚Äôll be enjoying coffee in these many mornings!

5.0,Very comfortable. Maintains shape. Easy to use.
5.0,"I like it.  Material is good T-shirt material I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 160 34DD<br />UPDATE: I ordered two medium‚Äôs the blue was loss, but nice. The black also a medium little stretch to tight."
5.0,"This dress was actually a gift for a friend. Due to my friend's preference for how she likes her clothing to fit, I did have to return it. I got my friend a medium, but I think a large would have been better because it would have fit her better. This dress is for you if you want a nice fitted outfit with style."
5.0,"This dress fit as expected and looked really pretty on me. I‚Äôm a size 12 and the dress was not tight at all. The fabric is thinner, but I did buy the dress just a little roomy so it didn‚Äôt hug me in all of the wrong places. I really love the dress."
5.0,"I had never dreamed of buying a suit online, as I usually try on about a 100 before choosing one in the store, but I hadn't found one I liked and this one was so much more affordable than the ones I had tried on so I took a chance on it!  I love it!  I've never had a suit that I've like this much... I'm about 140 and 5'5 got the Large.  I definitely would not consider my self &#34;athletic build&#34; but not super chunky either. I love that the bottoms cover all the right places I have a flat booty but big hips (muffin top) and it still looks cute.  Love that the top has supportive cups (not that I need much with B's) but has ties around the neck and back to really suit your size preference! Colors and patterns true to picture and high quality, especially for the price!  Haven't actually worn it in the water but seems like it will hold up well."
5.0,They are awesome ‚ò∫
5.0,"beautiful watch, great price"
5.0,Just little non-prescription lenses and frames for the child in your life. They arrived in satisfactory condition and made for a fun gift.
5.0,"This is great when traveling with more than one person. It allows me to keep mine and my family's passports, travel documents and all other esentials together in one place. It is extremely helpful when traveling internationally when mutlpiple things are needed frequently. Allows for easy access to eveyone at once."
5.0,"Purchased for to match a Prom dress & they matched perfectly, not too overbearing for a young lady. The outfit looked elegant with the earrings."
5.0,Perfect!!! Exactly what I had hoped for. The colors are right on!!

5.0,Absolute elegance and 1960s masculine smoothness vibe.... Ye!‚úÖ
5.0,Great kids gown. Very cute!
5.0,GORGEOUS DRESS!! Bought it for a funeral and received many compliments on it.  Little warm to wear during the summer but gives a curvy gal a wonderful shape.  Lace isn't scratchy and it stretches well.  HIGHLY recommend.

5.0,Worked great for the bracelets we made.

5.0,"I was worried because I couldn't find it in the package, however it was the type that was taped folded, and I discovered that the mask was inside the folded part, so if you get the same folded type and can't find it, be sure to check in that area."

5.0,"I love that it comes with all the pieces one needs in a single order - convenient.<br />The material is not too thick or thin so it is comfortable for spring, summer, and fall. Easy to machine wash and has held up its integrity after each wash over the past month. I love them so much I've ordered another set. I hope they will still be available as my daughter grows. I highly recommend these."
5.0,This gown is beautiful and affordable. The only problem was that some stones had to be sown back on and some had to be reinforced. It went great with the peacock clutch bag. It is true to size.
5.0,Great costume.my son loved it
5.0,"I loved them, but they are too small.  In my opinion, order a half to whole size up."

5.0,Cute and big.
5.0,"Very comfortable, cute shoes. I received numerous compliments on these. They did seem a tad larger than my usual size 8s, but I wore with very thin no show socks. They probably will be perfect with thicker socks. Wore walking around for several hours and my feet never hurt!"

5.0,"This is a beautiful box that is larger than it appears in this photo. I had always told my daughter she could have my grandmother's ring when she got married. A few weeks ago, her boyfriend asked our permission to propose. We had an inkling this was coming, so I ordered this case, put my grandmothers ring inside..and it was a beautiful moment. My husband didn't know the case had an LED light and later that evening said,'I  didn't remember Nana's ring sparkling like that across the room.' I explained about the light. This is a good case ..highly recommend."

5.0,Very nice and great size
5.0,"Feel great, a little small"
5.0,"I have a large bust, so my waist doesn't get highlighted in most dresses.  This is a very flattering style.  The fabric is 100% polyester, so I'll have to see how that holds up.  One odd thing - the label on the dress says it can be washed and dried, but the tag added to the dress says it has to be hand washed and line dried.  That should be fixed.  I washed it on delicate setting and it came out fine.  I haven't dried the drier, though.  I ordered the reddish style with flowers, and it's very pretty.  I ordered size 6, I'm 5'8"", 140-145 lbs."

5.0,"These daily masks are great, and I love that they are EWG certified. I use them in the morning before applying my makeup, and my face makeup looks SO MUCH BETTER! I just apply the mask, leave it on for 5 minutes while I pull my outfit and stuff together, then take the mask off and throw it away. It absorbs fast and leaves my skin super hydrated. Oh, and I have combo oily sensitive skin, and it's not too much moisture, and they don't break me out!"

5.0,A little UV loss but it's the 'go to' hat on a long hot day!

5.0,"I was honestly impressed with the quality of this dress considering the price, and also it's super cute! It fit just how I imagined it would and I couldn't be happier with it.

5.0,So cute on my granddaughter for summer camp water day.
5.0,"Beauty and quality at a great price, I wear it everyday!"
5.0,"He loves the way this shirt looks - the color, the material, the understated pattern, the crisp seams and button placket. And then the fit is perfect - very generous, not a ""slim"" and clingy fit. He wore it on Easter, so I know he considered it a quality garment, which it is.<br /><br />After machine washing and drying, it still looks sharp and the folds and creases held up, especially in the collar. A really nice surprise for a reasonably priced shirt. Well worth the money."
5.0,"wore this dress to a wedding, so many compliments.  I should have gotten a size M but the S wasn't too bad.  A little tight at waist but still love the dress"

5.0,"It's gorgeous m, everything we anticipated.."
5.0,This robe is the perfect three season weight. Sleeves are roomy enough to slide over any sleepwear without bunching. Love the feel of the fabric also.
5.0,Not as shiny as I expected but still super satisfied.
5.0,"It's much heavier than I expected. I was worried about the magnet clasp I've lost other pieces of jewelry with them in the past, but the design of this clasp is very strong<br />Great for people with arthritis"
5.0,Love it but has a hole on side
5.0,I love that this dress has pockets! The top part was a little big and loose fitting but still for overall. I got a ton of compliments on the dress too! It was comfortable and breathable.
5.0,"I'm pretty small, but this swimsuit fits perfect and is very cute. it doesn't rub like other swimsuits I've owned and is very very comfortable."

5.0,Arrived quickly. Satisfied with product. Would recommend these to anyone.

5.0,"Great quality, beautiful colors."
5.0,"Absolutely, love this keychain. It‚Äôs heavy, durable and oh so cute! Everyone that sees it likes it!"
5.0,"Great cover.  Love the American Sniper Theme and how partial proceeds go to the Chris Kule Frog Foundation.  The fabric section is thin but comfortable and it is eady to grasp and manipulate the wheel for quick response.  My hands are often drawn to the  rubber section at 2 and 10 o‚Äôclock if for any reason, it is probably for sensory reasons; the silicone just feels good! I dig this cover.  It's just a subtle but effective statement of one‚Äôs American Pride and support of an American Hero.<br /><br />Update: end seam has end that need to be sewn down. I feel drawn to the small edge and I want to pick at it.  It is a very small issue, but want you, a fellow consumer, to know about it. Overall, I‚Äôm still loving the cover though.<br /><br />Update 2: June 2022-fabric on top has ripped off.  Time to replace soon."

5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it! Not so fast. I'm currently trying to return this watch because like the first one we had, this is also defective because the watch does not stay closed while on. He really loves the look but that he constantly has to be closing it, it is not for him. He also doesn't want it to loose it this way being its always open‚òπÔ∏è"
5.0,The item makes a great gift for that special sister in your life.

I have it in navy blue and dark green. I love the dark green more though. I also love the pickets. I find myself putting my hands in one or both for the swag of it.

5.0,"I love how reflective this hat is!<br />I haven""t tried it on super windy runs (yet),  and runners know that is just as important as being seen.<br />I need something that will stay on my head in all weather conditions.

5.0,Knowing how much I absolutely love bears my son gave this to me as a Christmas gift.  It's perfect.  It looks exactly as the picture & looks great. It's a short necklace so stands up higher when you wear it and is nicely visible. I'd be careful to not wear it in the shower since it's metal.  I highly recommend it.

5.0,"For the price, this passport wallet is a steal. It is great looking and hopeful will block my passport RFID just as good."

5.0,"I have not used mine yet but they are NOT flimsy. The orange will definitely stand out at the airport. You will need a fine point sharpie to write your info on it. Let it dry good. Before putting away.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these, the rings that attach to luggage seem very strong as well. I can't wait to travel."
5.0,"I could not believe how great this look and fit, especially for the price!"

5.0,This hat is beautiful! I am attending the Kentucky derby this year and my dress is a coral color and was impossible to match. This hat is seriously amazing. But don't get it in coral if you're going to the derby cause we can't have the same one! Lol! I have a bigger head and this is the first hat that fits me perfectly. More than pleased. Can't find a better one in stores either. Definitely worth the money and it's a huge wide brim so it's even better!

5.0,Very cute dress...order 1-2 sizes up!
5.0,"Can't speak to longevity yet, but I can say that the Large fits me at 6'0"" and 185 lbs well.  I wear large in Under Armour compression leggings, and these are a little bit snugger - mostly due to the lack of the crotch pouch that UA has.  However, it's a good amount of slightly more compression which I like for running and which I think will be good for staying up while the phone is in the pocket."
5.0,"My husband bought me this set for Christmas, and let me tell you guys - I LOVE IT. It fits SO well, hugs you in all the right places, and allows you to feel free when working out. I have recommended this to SO many people, and if your debating buying it just do it. It will make you feel like the bad B you are."

5.0,I love it but my boyfriend just doesn't like the style on me so I don't think ill where it that much but its perfect other then that.

5.0,Awsome shoes! !
5.0,Fit great--no binding.  Like the longer length.  Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,"It's beautiful, perfect for the steampunk masquerade ball coming up. It's pretty big, and I'm a little worried about it sliding off."
5.0,"Loved them! They were true to size, some tunnels I have purchased online haven't been accurate in sizing."
5.0,"I LOVE it! The material is nice, you will need a camisole underneath. But it's SO cute and it actually fits perfectly! It's absolutely adorable! The ONLY negative is that it's wrinkled from being folded up in the bag and on a UPS truck for two days (totally understandable though)... But I hate and am not good at ironing! I'll figure it out though. LOVE THIS TOP! JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I wish they made it in more colors, I'd buy one in EVERY color!"

5.0,"I love this trainer. I ordered it in a small, following the manufacturer's size chart...I wear it on the tightest latch for it to fit. I wear it daily for 12 hours.

5.0,The earrings were gorgeous. Delivery was fast. Very satisfied!!  Would recommend and will definitely buy from them again. Thank you!!

5.0,"Beautiful dress, came out of the bag without a wrinkle! Being I ordered this for a vacation the wrinkle free material is great. Color was just what my husband wanted me to wear."
5.0,"Husband loves his, we bought it at Home Depot a few years back but they no longer carry this head cover.<br />Purchased several for family members and they all agreed on how it kept the wind out."
5.0,Overall happy with the purchase and the size was just perfect! This are my first bike shoes and getting used to it will take some time.

5.0,Best color you carry besides black. 40L fits perfect.
5.0,"I just bought this WETSOX Layer One Athletic shirt and I freaking love it! I originally bought it for its sun protection when I go paddle boarding but now I where it allllll the time. I wear it anytime I am outside, playing basketball, running, golf, and hiking. It is super cooling right when I put it on and it drys really fast as well. It has a snug athletic fit so it doesn't move around or get scrunched up. I highly recommend this product!"

5.0,"These LED flasher pet collar safety blinkers are wonderful for evening or night walks. They are bright, lightweight and don't bother my dogs while walking. These flasher clips are a great way to keep myself and my fur babies safe during our walks. There are other options to using these clips. Not only can you use them for the animals, but you and the family can use them also. And they are battery operated, just pop it open and replace then battery and you‚Äôre ready to use them again.<br />I received a discount on this in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions<br />are based on my personal experience with the product."
5.0,My 4 year old boy looks RAD in these and he loves them

5.0,Bathsuit looks good on me. Only issue I have is the top with my breast area just a tinsy bit big because I have small breast but that happens with all my clothes so that's fine.
5.0,"Loved it! The fabric is soft and spandexy, making it feel so light = a year around cardi for me!<br /><br />I am 185lbs, 32C, 5‚Äô9‚Äù and I ordered the L/XL"
5.0,"This dress is absolutely teacher cute! Since I love Christmas it was the perfect addition to my numerous amount of T-shirts and sweaters. It was super comfortable and a great conversation piece. As many others have commented, the material is slightly thin so I just wore a T-shirt and leggings underneath."
5.0,Fit is a bit tight but it's such a cute outfit. Lots of compliments. The only thing is that it pills a bit but I just use a shaver.
5.0,"Very strong my scalp feels mints when I have it on,by now I love it ..... very happy customer :)"

5.0,The product comes with five pairs of cute socks. Very soft and my kids love them.
5.0,Used it for pearl cages
5.0,"These masks are stamped as KN 95 although nothing is mentioned in the description, so just FYI. I am not sure if these meet KN 95 standard but they are a good fit, Five layers, ear loops are strongly fixed to the mask and nose adjustment works well. This mask is designed to keep the air from coming in sideways; its sides go tightly against your face and allow less air to come through compared to the regular disposable three ply masks. This is a pack of 20; with 5 masks per individual pack, total of 4 packs inside."
5.0,"I got cream, and sprayed it with scotchgaurd. Get comments everyday. Love it! I'm afraid it will get dirty, but we'll see."
5.0,Very soft and pretty.
5.0,fits true to size I weighed around 116 when I purchased this shirt in a small and it fit perfect. Its a really nice shirt and the embroidery on the sides are really pretty. It's a thin shirt material so its very cold outside it won't keep you warm. Love with this. Would recommend this shirt.
5.0,They were the type of earrings my daughter wanted.  They look very pretty on her. Now I want to pair
5.0,The kids were all time at the beach.

5.0,Where do I even begin! This was so incredibly packaged I was so afraid all of these earrings would come tangled together but literally each individual item was packaged properly and together with its pair in a separate package.

5.0,"When worn back to front, these look like medium fat hoop earrings. I really like that my alcohol did not discolor them when I cleaned them. The price for 3 sets was very nice too :)"
5.0,My daughter did clementine at a convention and this hat fits amazing and she LOVES it! I hope this review helps!

5.0,Perfect for summer! Lightweight and breathable.
5.0,Arrived in the condition advertised.
5.0,"This watch has the most unique watch face.  Instead of the standard numbers or markers for the hours, it has an array of different colored baguette crystals that really stand out from the white background of the watch face.  It also has a larger than normal watch face that makes it very easy to read and allows enough room to have the large baguette crystals stand out.  This beautiful watch really makes a fashion statement!  I love, love, love it!"
5.0,Really like these capris!!!!
5.0,Love very pretty definitely need an undershirt for daytime wear extremely comfortable
5.0,I bought it once and then two more. Medium is perfect for me and it looks pretty.
5.0,"The color of summer is a soft coral or salmon color which this bathing suit expresses perfectly!  The black bottoms contrast the top portion of the suit and brings out the beautiful salmon color outstandingly. This bathing suit has every great feature I was looking for in a one piece suit. The zip up in the back makes it nice and snug so I do not have to worry about any loose material. The zipper is also a very fine gold color which goes with the whole design nicely. The last great feature is the tie in the back which gives the bathing suit a whole new look and feel. Brings the simplicity level to a cute, sweet and feminine look. Great bathing suit all the way around from color, style, and design!"
5.0,Before cataract surgery wore glasses for distance only. After needed for everything but distance. With these glasses I can now read in comfort and switch to walking around or using computer without switching glasses. Look great too.
5.0,"This is the second wallet like this one. This one I bought for me.  The first one was a gift and they tell every time I see them how great it is, so I  decided to buy one for myself. The leather is very soft and is put together well. I like the two tones of leather."
5.0,Great quality hat! It was better than I expected for the price!
5.0,"I love this purse! It's big and roomy, and appears to be well made and excellent quality. There is no middle divider, which is my normal preference, but I love it anyway. The blood roses artwork is absolutely stunning. I plan to use it for the month of October, basically for a Halloween seasonal purse, then put it away in the closet until next year. I would recommend this purse to anyone. I have also purchased several shirts from Spiral and have been very happy with all of them."
5.0,Bought these for my son and he loves them. He spends a great deal of time in Costa Rica and says he loves the fact that they are waterproof.
5.0,galaxy S3
5.0,"These are comfortable and fit right without being too loose or too tight. It hides my Glucose Monitor and whatever else I want to hide. However, it skims the places that you'd want it to skim, as well..."
5.0,Very vary good!
5.0,"Absolutely love this tunic. Have bought it in different colors. Very lovely, and very comfortable!"
5.0,Beautiful chain and great price!!!!
5.0,"I bought this for a Hoe and CEO party that my friends were having. I was the only guy who wore something bold. It was a little tight, but comfortably. Worth the purchase."
5.0,It's exactly what I was looking for in a conceal carry purse.
5.0,"I have never used a neck gaiter before and now see that I should have been using one for years.<br /><br />While it's common knowledge that much of our body heat is lost through our head, I have to think that much is also lost through our neck now that I've used this product.<br /><br />I kid you not, once I put this on, it felt like my body temperature went up a degree.  It is amazingly comfortable and I believe makes all the difference in keeping warm when Jack Frost is nipping.  I wore it while trail riding a 4 wheeler in temps that hovered around 22 degrees.  I had a neoprene face mask to keep my face protected but I truly believe this product was instrumental in maintaining my overall warmth/comfort.  I ended up taking off my face mask since between this and my wool watch cap, I was more than warm enough since I never exceeded 25mph.<br /><br />No doubt on my Harley I'll still need the neoprene face mask for highway speeds but will make damn sure I'm wearing this whenever I ride in the cold.<br /><br />For how little this costs and for how much it made a difference.  I am SOLD."
5.0,"I love this suit, probably my favorite I've ever owned. I'm 5'8&#34;, 160 lbs & wear a C or D depending on the bra. Based on reviews, ordered a 2XL, which I was worried would be too big but fits perfect, wouldn't change a thing.<br />Seems to be good quality & was comfortable in the water. I'll post more if it doesn't hold up well, since I swim 6 days a week in a pool & know others may like that info, especially in regards to chlorine."
5.0,So good looking and sturdy! So glad I bought this and ordered on Amazon!
5.0,Well made and good looking. Hurray for being made in the USA.
5.0,"Great boots,very rich looking,heel  size is a good switch from higher heels . I take a 7 and they fit perfectly.. On the negative side they could have a little more cushioning inside ."
5.0,Love it.  Its pretty and its COMFORTABLE.
5.0,I love them for my son but my niece did something to it but within a couple of hours one shoe stopped working. What can I do
5.0,i love these boots soooooo much!!!
5.0,"These were a gift for my daughter and she loves them. Nice size, nice quality"
5.0,"Attached this to my invicta pro diver. Great strap for the money, proper nato length material is nice, hardware is as well. It‚Äôs a bit stiff when new, obviously at first, but the more you wear it the more comfortable it becomes. You can install the strap a few different ways, I have mine setup with the buckles under the wrist for clean sides. Would recommend."
5.0,"GREAT, NO PROBLEMS!"
5.0,"A great summer, casual dress...a tich high waisted, but I have a long waist.  It's a nice fabric too!"
5.0,My daughter wore this for last Halloween and she was thrilled with it. She liked everything about the way it looked and fit. Even the wig that came with it looked nicely made. Definitely would recommend this seller's costumes.
5.0,I like it so much the sizes were perfect
5.0,It‚Äôs so cute! I keep it on my vanity table. It came in perfect condition and the packaging was good to keep it from getting smashed. It has a nice weight to it and the pink color is lovely. I can see this as a good small gift to give someone.
5.0,"I love the vibrant colors of these scarfs.  They protect my hair from the friction/being pulled on my clothing.  I had to order again because to care for these, it's best that you hand wash."
5.0,Comfortable and stylish. Great for work. Got compliments the first day I wore it.
5.0,"Beautiful and as described. Arrived quickly, thank you!"
5.0,Tall but not too tall...I'm 5' 9&#34; and 172lbs and have managed to lose weight over the past few years. Great but now my skin is looser. These fit great in l/xl without being too tight..
5.0,"I love this top!! It‚Äôs so soft and so stretchy and looks so chic! It a wide ribbed material that hugs your body. It does run small and it is quite a bit shorter than it appears in the photo, so keep this in mind. It‚Äôs not a crop top but it hits directly at the natural waist. So, for this reason I‚Äôll only wear it with more mid to high waist pants or jeans.<br /><br />I‚Äôm glad I ordered a medium, though I typically wear smalls. I‚Äôm 34B, 135 lbs. and the medium is perfect.<br /><br />It is a little sheer and lightweight so it definitely needs to be worn with a white or nude bra or bralette.<br /><br />Overall I would totally recommend it, it‚Äôs really beautiful and the bell sleeve is long but not too long and it is so feminine and mod looking. I‚Äôm going to order the other color. I wish there were more colors!"
5.0,This sums up the time in my life right now!
5.0,"I absolutely love these adorable leg warmers for my twins. They add style to simple jumpsuits/onesies, so my babies don't have to wear pants for their cold legs and it's quicker for me at diaper changing time. They are also harder for my babies to remove than socks and allow them foot traction as they begin to scoot around.  However, I really hope to see them offered in larger sizes as my babies grow! I'm pretty sure that these leg warmers (labeled to fit toddlers, too) will be tight on my 19-pound  seven-month olds within a month or two. They wear size 9 mos to 18 months, depending on the label.  I would have to say that these leg warmers run a bit small for babies with chunky legs. I will be sad the day they can no longer wear them. They are so stinkin cute."
5.0,Very CUTE! Nice material. I would recommend.
5.0,Great quality I was impressed
5.0,"I was looking for a comfortable yet stylish pants to wear to work and on social occasions. This pant did not disappoint at all. It fits true to size and really comfortable! I received so many compliments, I have to purchase more. You can dress it down with a flat or a heel."
5.0,They came on time and we used them at the beach to collect shells!!
5.0,Love it! I used it under my danza traje and it fit like a glove
5.0,They fit perfectly!!! True to size.
5.0,"Green color was a little off but overall great, fit as expected. No complaints."
5.0,Fit very comfortably! Be careful in the wind with this dress ;) otherwise beautiful!
5.0,"Wow! this bag is so soft and the sweet smell of  the new leather is an intoxicating with blend of the special quality it is made of, I love it so much. I put my key chain with all it's store tags and numerous keys in one pocket my cell phone which is pretty large in another pocket my folding wallet with a coin pocket in it in another pocket and my head phones and a couple of small odds and ends in the smaller pocket. I feel so complete. Oh, and it is a very comfortable hang across my shoulders and I have adjusted it to my hip, we are one I am so proud of it.<br />Too cool.<br />MB"

5.0,These are Great! Use them for holding my glasses and Sunglasses for bicycle commute to and from work each day.  Work Great!
5.0,Just love it! So soft -
5.0,This is a beautiful necklace. The pattern is very &amp; unique. It's also definitely sterling silver &amp; not nickel (I'm allergic to nickel &amp; would have broken into a rash if it weren't real - I've ordered jewelry in the past claiming to be sterling silver but was not).
5.0,"Purchased this for my husband and he loves it.  His wedding ring is also made from Tungston. He is a mechanic and the ring shows no signs of damage after 3 years so I was excited to find a watch made from the same material. He does not wear the watch to work because of the risk of it getting hung up on something leading to injury to him but when he does wear it, our 2 year old is always trying to mess with it. It handles his abuse well! The watch looks very nice."
5.0,I love this tie! Very happy with the quality.
5.0,"Lightweight, comfortable, great visual clarity"
5.0,Great purple color. Nice addition to my work wardrobe.
5.0,"Great dress. Stiff material in the skirt, which to me makes it more fancy. Comfortable top. Great for a wedding, cocktail party, or fancy occasion."
5.0,The watch can be worn by both men and women and looks really nice on either. Only had it for a week but it keeps better time than most automatics do. Very nice looking watch and reasonably priced.

5.0,Comfortable band
5.0,Great fit! I ordered this dress after looking at the reviews and pics.. even thou it was cloth materials very comfortable and you can dress this up or dress it down!

I believed I ordered a Large but it was a great fit and no worries.
5.0,Beautiful necklace set.
5.0,"Excellent product, versatile design, convenient zipper pocket on the reverse side. I use it all the time now for chargers and cord storage."

5.0,Love love love these leggings. So soft and comfy
5.0,"Really cool evil eye bracelet. The beaded part is a bit noisy when it moves around on my wrist, but I don't mind. The leather straps, beads, and eye seem to be bright and good quality."
5.0,Very Cute!  This soft coin purse is exactly what i wanted.  It is made well and most importantly is bright and cute and easy to see in my purse.
5.0,"Cute and good quality, my daughter will love it."
5.0,Cute shirt for Valentines day or end day really!
5.0,Be yourself!
5.0,I got these for my dad for Christmas.  He got a kick out of them.  We have an ongoing joke about armadillos.  They are a nice weight to wear with dress shoes.  Dad likes wearing them to church.
5.0,Fits good..got a compliment on the street by complete strangers..
5.0,The neckline dips a little low for a work situation but can be remedied with lace or a camisole.
5.0,"Great band, love it!"
5.0,My husband love his watch.
5.0,This is going to be a big hit with my niece after her dance recital.  It came in three days and is perfect!  Thanks Bella.

5.0,"For a woman,  this fit great! Loved the purchase and will buy more.. great colors."
5.0,The way it fits and the pockets I love it !
5.0,Cute nose studs it's always nice to have a bunch on hand for when one gets lost or the stone falls out which happens a lot with nose studs. I haven't had any issues with them great quality for the price will order more
5.0,I use these for Spartan races. I even used them for a 30 mile ultra spartan race in muddy rainy North Carolina and they stood the course. I would buy again.
5.0,They are a bit heavy. But i love them all the same. I get many compliments thank you! Really satisfied. If theres only one thing i would changed is the fact ots opalite not moonstone like it says in the title description.
5.0,The dress is true to it advertising. The fabric is comfortable. The craftsmanship is well designed.
5.0,"Nice vest, fits comfortable but is made for slim frames only. Could have a better power and temperature select button. Overall a positive purchase. Very happy."
5.0,Spacious with room for everything our little buffalo needs!
5.0,Arrived on time and looks great with my all black costume
5.0,"Comfortable, and sturdy, made of cotton expect elastic adjustable strap.  Very nice for working in an environment where you need to cover your hair or at home while cooking or other chores, washes easy, dries nicely."
5.0,"This is an excellent product. It's lightweight and dries quickly. It keeps the sun off the back of your neck and can be pulled up in a second when a face covering is required. If you're outdoors alone you can leave the gaiter around your neck without getting too hot. If you must enter a building or can no longer socially distance, just pull the gaiter up to cover your nose and face."
5.0,Review written by person using product<br /><br />This are perfection.  I wear a womens size 7 and they fit me perfectly.  I get so many compliments on them and they have been helpful through this stormy weather with both rain and snow.  I am an avid UGGs wearer so I have the spray to weather proof them.  The kids styles are always so much cuter then the adult models.
5.0,Great Scapular! Seems very durable üôèüèΩ
5.0,"Ive had this Seiko for 9 years and its workes perfectly.  Its a mechanical watch with amazing lum.  Its a big and heavy watch.  Yet extremely comfortable to wear.  The timing bezel is very smooth.  I can turn it with one finger.  I like the sound of the hezel, like opening a safe.  It has the date between the the 4 and 5 oclock markers at an angle.  Surprisingly very easy to read.  I really love the bracelet on this watch.  The back of the watch is very unusual, it like an unpside down Sumo.  That the case back sits in a ring of metal.  Long discontinued, its worth finding a used sample."
5.0,super cute! i love it. great price and still good quality
5.0,This dress is perfect for any body type! I am around 220lbs and got a size XL. The fit is perfect. Im not one to wear dresses bc several dresses look like bags on my body type. But this is one I will be wearing a lot!
5.0,So cute and fun and stay on the feet and wash well.
5.0,So cute!!! Adorable on my little girl!

5.0,Great gift that is what mine are for. Very nice.
5.0,"My wife abuses sunglasses. I bought a similar three pack a while ago and she loved the look and the fact that they were cheap so she didn't have to worry about them. The polarization is actually pretty good on these and they come with either a soft case or a hard case. So came back and ordered more and they are still just as good as always, so I am a happy customer."
5.0,Wife love it thank you
5.0,This is beautiful but I didn‚Äôt like how it looked on me personally. Great quality and the stretchy denim is nice
5.0,Wife loves its
5.0,I worse this at least 6 times! Super cute  and well made.
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these earrings. I've seen similar earrings for $10-$15 per pair in stores everywhere. Getting all of these for this price is pretty amazing. I'd purchased them because I love the D clasp style of earring and there were several in this group. (They don't come unfastened when hiking, camping, swimming, etc.)<br />All the earrings are nice weight and well made. I'll be buying more from this company in the future."
5.0,Absolutely loved them. They look even better in person and was perfect for my bracelets.will definitely order more
5.0,Looks just as pictured! Perfect gift for our soccer team
5.0,"terrific .. fits perfectly, trivially easy to put in place given the pin design .. takes a few seconds if that to put in the watch"
5.0,Looks good and great size and quality
5.0,"Bought these socks for my husband and he loves them!  They keep his feet warm as expected.  He has diabetes, so he wears them all the time..... THEY ARE PERFECT!"
5.0,They are light but not as light as I was thinking they would be. They are metal so that's to be expected. The quality is amazing especially for the price they didn't hurt my ears. I love them and the length is perfect.
5.0,This ring is perfect! I like the material better than the typical rubber ring thingies. It feels sturdier. I don't foresee this stretching out the way some others do. Absolutely love it!
5.0,I LOVE THESE! The price was incredible and the earrings wow!
5.0,"I've only had these glasses a couple days,  so I'm still getting used them.  They are very well made. They make the colors much more vibrant, so everything looks more alive. I'm going to have relearn my colors.  They are dark enough for sunlight and can be worn inside."
5.0,I like them so far. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and wear a size Large 12-14. I ordered a size up XL and it fit perfect. Bought it to flatten my tummy and it definitely does that. Also feels comfortable when I sit down.
5.0,"Fast shipping, perfect condition, beautiful boots!"
5.0,"Good looking, strong key chain and affordable too."
5.0,I am a big fan of ROSAL√çA and her fashion. When I saw this top I said perfect this is gonna come with me to MEXICO!!! Every one that I saw that day asked me where did I get this top!!!! Fits perfect!!! And colors are vibrant just like the picture.
5.0,Love love love these bangles so beautiful love the different mixes I can make if I don‚Äôt want all on one arm

5.0,Great play shoes!
5.0,Beautiful watch.  Great company to deal with.
5.0,"They‚Äôre beautiful, but heavy!"
5.0,Love the fit.. like alotü§©ü§©
5.0,Arrived quickly and as expected.
5.0,"Great product, just what I was looking for"
5.0,I used it for a watch that I have the band works perfectly
5.0,Awesome album. Reacently discovered theese guys and love 'em. This album has a great sound with a good message. Cant say i love all there stuff but this is the one that got me interested.
5.0,Favorite shirt but one string came undone when I washed it but I've had it about a year before that happened lol buying another one in another color
5.0,"This hat is lightweight, breathable, packable, has a sun protection factor, is comfortable and inexpensive. I wear it to the beach to prevent my scalp from burning or while doing yardwork. Even in the hot summer sun I was surprised at how comfortable my head stayed while wearing this cap. It folds down really small, too, so you can just keep it in a pocket for when you need it. I recommend this product."
5.0,"For me, these are the perfect leggings. They have a wonderful stretch. The waistband provides pretty decent tummy support hiding in my mommy tummy and love handles. Very durable, I have washed and dry these on normal settings. They haven't faded or look worn out in any way. I have never had leggings like this, especially look as brand new as they do and I wear them all the time, they're my go-to leggings! I will order more once they come in the stock. They look good as a workout outfit or dressing them up or dressing them down. They go perfect with almost every outfit. They are very comfortable, soft and I love the stretch to them but they're still supportive and they're the perfect length on me. I ordered the large and it fits perfectly. I am 5'1, 152 lb, 38-in waist, almost 41-in hips. I carry all my weight in my stomach and love handles. These make me look like I'm skinnier lol"
5.0,Will look better when I lose an inch or two in my waist! Otherwise a very nice skirt!
5.0,"Really nice thick leather belt that I hope to use someday because it's a little to small for me, perhaps it will fit a 38 or smaller waist."
5.0,I love these sandals. They fit as expected and they‚Äôre comfortable too. I haven‚Äôt worn sandals for over 15 years because of feet problems but these are comfortable without an insert.
5.0,"These are thick, heavy sweatpants that are very cozy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and weigh 155. The small fits well and is not baggy or tight. For the price paid, I think these are fantastic. Very nice quality, comfort, and fit!"
5.0,Excellent purchase for the price
5.0,The baptism outfits were perfect.
5.0,My grandson loves these shoes.  I like them because we live in Florida and the shoes breathe and gives him complete comfort.
5.0,My wife loved this necklace. It was perfect.
5.0,"My son loves the orange. Wish it had built in undies, but we managed. He loves the color and the long sleeves."
5.0,"I love this but it runs real small, I gave it to my teenage daughter"
5.0,"In a world where we need to wear masks, you can actually breath in these.  Love them"
5.0,Beautiful and well made. Please give them a few days to wear them then I can give you a true comment. They have only been here 3 days.
5.0,"So cute, better than the pic"
5.0,Great as outerwear or as a warm undergarment.  Nice and soft against the skin.  Surprisingly good quality for the price.
5.0,"Solid pieces for the price and exactly what I was looking for. Got the anklet size so the girls could choose where to wear them and it turned out perfect, even for adults."
5.0,Great quality! The person I bought them for complains that the top of the socks are too tight
5.0,"Fun, perfect for the price!"
5.0,Comfy and flattering. Could wear this dress all day and all night!
5.0,Loving my rings!!!
5.0,"flattering! i'm petite but also curvy. Im 148lbs, 5ft 1in. waist 28in hips 42in. and bought a medium."
5.0,"Very cute. I'm normally a small, but ordered a medium b/c I'm pregnant. It fit perfect!"
5.0,"fit is long and loose, but as pictured and exactly what i was looking for!"
5.0,"It fits perfect! I love this dress wear with sandals, heels, or sneakers!"
5.0,these stay on my head even looking down in 95 degrees with a like humidity...sweating is all but guaranteed unless you are dead. These glasses are my go to.
5.0,Es muy comodo
5.0,Very cute and grear for winter with booties and tights or leggings.
5.0,I like it.<br /><br />It‚Äôs unique. It keeps your head warm and it can be used for years to come.
5.0,Love the game way these fit over toes allowing me to wear sneakers/slip on mule shoes without the athletic sock. Stays in place and does not add any bulk. So glad I found these on Amazon because I have looked in stores - no success. Great item.
5.0,"I was hesitant to purchase a One Size Fits All set of bras especially considering the varying reviews, but they fit me just as I wanted. I am 5'6, medium build, size 10 in clothing, and range between a 34DD and 36DD depending on the brand/style of bra. I did not purchase these as sports bras because they definitely would not have enough support to be considered sports bras for larger bust sizes, but I purchased these as comfort bras. I wear them around the house, under tank tops for added support and a pop of color, and out and about for errands. I did not have any issues with bulging under the arms or being too tight in the bust. The pads cover the exact area I would want them to.  The pads do bend if put in the washer, but I now use the handwash cycle and then hang dry and haven't had an issue since!  The colors have stayed true through washing and even the bright red did not bleed.  I would recommend them to other women solely as comfort bras when you're tired of underwire, but need some daily support.  I also have comfort pull-over bras by Hanes and Barely There and I would say these definitely compare in comfort, but go one step further and offer more color options."
5.0,I absolutely love this. I ordered one size up to be careful and it fits perfectly so I recommend to order up a size if you are worried. It feels well-made and fits comfortably. I would definitely reccomend this to a friend.
5.0,so cute love  them
5.0,I bought this for my trainers at work for helping me get my CDL.  They loved this bracelet!
5.0,It‚Äôs very unique and pretty
5.0,Great as a maternity shirt too!
5.0,This was a risky pay for me but I don‚Äôt regret it! I got so many complements and I love everything about this outfit!
5.0,"Bought this for my little one, and he loves it, colors matches for this upcoming 4th of july :)"
5.0,"Great product, I am going to buy more. I have a lot of silver jewelry and the cloth does a fantastic job of cleaning and polishing. I bought this one because it was a larger size and I couldn't be happier with it."
5.0,I love the pink tint! Super cute
5.0,I love these shirts. Anyone having shoulder surgery needs them. Great guality and easy to put on after surgery.  Even the surgery center was impressed.
5.0,These are now my favorite slippers.  So comfortable and keep your feet warm without making them too hot
5.0,"This is my first Russell, and it totally blows my other hoodies out of the water. It's the heaviest and thickest, which makes it the warmest. It also has the best hood design, in my opinion.<br /><br />I have a shaved head and my other hoodies snag on my stubble, and leave fuzzies on my cranium. The Russell does not do this, since the whole hood is doubled-over, where the smooth outer surface is inside the hood. This makes the hood warmer (double the material), as well as provides a smoother on/off action of the hood.<br /><br />Sure, it's more expensive, but I definitely can tell the difference in quality of manufacturing, materials, and design. Can't go wrong with this one. I loved it so much, I just recently ordered the zip hoodie, too."
5.0,Works as described. Good quality!
5.0,Love this hat!!!  Perfect fit and so comfortable.  The elastic in the back fits just below my messy bun and the visor size is perfect.  Thank you.  I have the dark gray color.
5.0,"I find I don't just use these for exercise, but I'll sometimes where them for work, too. They are GREAT!!! They stay up all day and I love them. My only worry is that there isn't a ton of fabric down by the toe, but so far my fears have not been met as they've held together just fine so far (probably three wearings each). But I'm glad I have these and intend to buy more. Very comfortable, and not too tight."
5.0,Was a gift for dental hygienist  She thought they were cute.
5.0,Very cute earrings üëåüèªüíï
5.0,My two favorite words CHEAP and CUTE. I wore these when I went to Disneyland and they were perfect.
5.0,"I am giving them to my book club ladies.  A good book, warm socks and a cup of tea!"
5.0,"The hat is a great conversation starter, is really breathable so your head can be cool, and has a great fit too.  The material was a little different than most hats I get, but not bad by any means."
5.0,Great for the summer- quick delivery - good quality
5.0,"Perfect price, fit and style! Love it"
5.0,super quality. love the variety. I'm sure they will last a long time. I get compliments all the time. they go with everything
5.0,The right product at the right price for me.  Very pleased.
5.0,"Love this bracelet - simple and pretty, but durable and wears well."
5.0,Very cute. I got an XL 5'6 225 42C (ugh postpartum). The dress reaches my knees. Has pockets! True to its picture. Enough boob room to make breastfeeding easy. Love it will order more.
5.0,This is awesome. My jewelry has never looked better.  Even after a jewelry store has cleaned my goodies.
5.0,"These angels are perfect for giving to caregivers, patients, family and friends."
5.0,"Awesome, 5 stars!"
5.0,It's great! It's going to make a nice shirt to wear for being Morty for Halloween :)
5.0,While the product was very well made the rubber was too thick for the purpose we purchased it for. Quality product definitely.
5.0,My go to compression socks!
5.0,"My wife mentioned that she wanted a necklace like this where the pearls are spaced out.  I wanted to get her a white gold one since silver tarnishes so easily.  When I found this one, there was not picture, so I emailed La Regis to ask to post a picture so that I could confirm that the necklace would match their description.  They responded within a day and posted multiple pictures. The necklace looked just like they had described it, so I went ahead and bought it.  This is a very nice necklace, and my wife was so excited to get it and wear it."
5.0,Great working pocket clip
5.0,A best buy. So I came back and bought this one. Looks great with shorts & lightweight pants in the summer
5.0,I haven't worn it yet but it is just what I expected so I am sure I will be wearing it soon.
5.0,These pants are beautiful and beautifully made. They stretch a bet so they are comfortable to wear.
5.0,Super sturdy and gnarly style. Way better than my old ones as far as fit is concerned.
5.0,Beautiful outfit!! Fits really well!!!
5.0,Sooo uniqly beautiful.
5.0,"Uncommonly well-built shoe. Uniformly thick leather stitched with what looks like mostly cotton thread (won't cut through the leather or get brittle from UV exposure) over leather piping for reinforcement. Looks like it will be extremely durable. The inside of the shoe is very soft and well-finished as well. Also, the sole is quite grippy."
5.0,Hopefully this will fit on my Husband's key chain
5.0,"The dress exceeded my expectations, and I love it!"
5.0,I used the chart for size and chose the size it said I needed.  It is way too big. I liked the look of the top in the pics.  I need to return the top but unsure what size to order.
5.0,This watch is so pretty in person
5.0,So cute! A little short in back but the built in shorts help :)
5.0,"These faux piercings are just adorable. They are very pretty and delicate with a lot of sparkle to them. Each piece is easily adjustable to size but also stays on quite easily as well - you don‚Äôt have to wear them too tightly in order to make them stay on, which is awesome. I like the look of more piercings up my ears, so I have been using these to have the look of cartilage piercings without actually getting cartilage piercings (although I‚Äôm hoping to have the courage to get one soon!) I definitely recommend this set - if you enjoy changing up your look with this type of thing you will like these. They‚Äôre easy to wear and they look cute!"
5.0,"It just feels good, I needed something with no hooks in the back.Those hurt my back when I sit on a hard pew in church. No problem with this bra."
5.0,Gym shoes fit tight inside but they are good and compact for carrying in car for wet days.
5.0,Love it!  All of my stuff fit great with easy access.  Leather is soft.  Well put together.
5.0,I will definitely buy another pair of these. I didn't think they would hold my shirt in. They did the trick.
5.0,"Fit great, durable... dark lenses, just the way I like them."
5.0,"Cute little crochet cover-up, shows off a bit of what's under without leaving you totally exposed. One-size only; I'm a size 12 and it fits great. Can't wait for summer! Great purchase, super fast shipping."
5.0,Fits my grand daughter well. I want to find more like this
5.0,It is stylistic and beautiful.
5.0,These are awesome they haven't broken yet I sleep  and shower with them ..
5.0,These are cute.. they are alot smaller than this makes them appear. If you have the cartledge on up in your ear pierced...like where the ear cartledge makes its' appearance they would be cute for a teenager with short hair. They are a little small especially for long hair for older women where your ears are normally pierced. Putting your hair up away from your face..these would or will be cute. Whatever your preference.. they are very cute and for us older women... that remains a total &#34;of your own&#34; preference...not for thicker ear lobes just too tiny even for my skinny ear lobes but you know you have it on..thats all that matters.
5.0,I lived everything about this dress.
5.0,Perfect gift for the difficult teen. She loved it!
5.0,Yes my husband really likes these boots easy Off & on we're a Christmas gift

5.0,The price was fantastic for six pairs of gloves. And yet they‚Äôre very cute and perfect for winter
5.0,I love these lanyards because they‚Äôre not flat and wide like others I have bought.  I attach these to the masks I sew and it doesn‚Äôt irritate my neck like the flat ones.  I don‚Äôt even feel it around my neck and use them when I have several stops to make so I‚Äôll always have my mask on me and don‚Äôt have to worry about dropping it.
5.0,Nice design combining Celtic and Nordic artistry.
5.0,Not like the original but for the price I think it‚Äôs awesome.
5.0,"I love this hooded sweatshirt.  It's not as heavy as a typical sweatshirt, which is fine with me.

5.0,Very nice looking baby shoes.
5.0,I absolutely love it!! I purchased for my mom as a Christmas gift. I hope she dislikes it so I can keep it for myself!!
5.0,"I am 5'6&#34;, and weigh 154.5 pounds (just weighed myself this morning).  I bought size Large, in the Rose Bouquet - Black Royal Mint pattern.  As you can see in my pictures, I have plenty of saddle bags and butt to go around, and this size fits me very comfortably.  The ONLY reason I posted these photos, is so that it's easier for someone of a similar size to visualize how this size might fit them.  When I bend over and look in the mirror, I don't see any of the &#34;see through&#34; problems like some have stated in a few of the other prints, but I can't see myself in a full bend position to know if they really aren't see through.  I don't think they are anyways.<br /><br />I am a beginner at yoga though, so for now, I am just practicing with a DVD in my home.  As I get better, and a little thinner, I plan to join a class.  At that point though, I hope to have lost at least an inch or two around the hips, so then the stretching problem, really shouldn't even be an issue at all.<br /><br />I really do like this print however, and so does my 5 year old granddaughter!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."
5.0,Husband lost his band and purchased these as a replacement. He loves it and wears it full time.

5.0,"Only thing i would change is the bug made in China wording but other than that, perfect."
5.0,"I have a really hard time finding a pair of boots. I‚Äôm very picky with the style, the fit, but most importantly the feel. These boots were the best Christmas gift! I love my Birkenstock sandals and live in them as long as possible.  These boots make going out in the snow not so difficult!"
5.0,"They fit so perfect for my size, I'm 5'0 150lbs so I got a large (my usual size) and they got wonder full. Not so tight not so loose just perfect, it's very soft too ! I'm in love with it üòªüòª"

5.0,"This was a gift for someone, but they indicated it was fine."
5.0,"I‚Äôve been wanting some packing cubes for a while.  Tried compression bags but these are like the next level up! I did my research and decided on my these and so far I am Not Sorry!  The material is durable, zippers are sturdy, and the sizes are what closed the deal. We travel so much and I need to pack smartly within weight guidelines. My Bagail set allows me to easily pack everything I want and as you can imagine, unpacking is a breeze - these are great for short and long trips!  I‚Äôll be trying them out shortly and I know I‚Äôll be more than satisfied! Yes, I recommend these bags! Get them, enjoy them!!"
5.0,"I was looking for a nice quality plate for the front of my Grand Cherokee. Living in the southwest, to me, the website picture of the plate really looked great.  I was pleasantly surprised when this plate was delivered.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  It was so nice that I bought a clear cover so the bugs and gravel would not mess it up, the plate was something I wanted to keep nice. A quality item, fast shipping. :)"
5.0,"I love it! Gorgeous dress, great price and I received it within a week."
5.0,"I love this dress!!! It's a little too short for me, so I wear it with leggings :) It has a very generous cut and is trendy, yet classic. It will perfect for layering with leggings and a denim jacket for fall!"
5.0,This is the second best casio digital watch I've had. The limiting factor is how long I can go without breaking the band otherwise this thing will outlast me
5.0,Love this piece. Perfect to wear with leggings.
5.0,bought this boa for a 5 year old who was part of our dance routine and she loved it!  It was the perfect size and she had a great time shimmying it around her shoulders and lifting above her head.
5.0,This is a really awesome little dress. I love the way it fits and it drapes so well. Hides any imperfections yet gives hints to shapely curves. This is one if my husband's favorite dresses on me and the fondness to it has grown the more times I wear it.
5.0,Very cute. My five year old picked this and looks very cute in it.
5.0,The studs are smaller than pictured but beautiful!
5.0,Was a gift. was very nice and heavy and I could read the prayer. Great detail
5.0,Owl loving daughter loves them.
5.0,"You know, I really can't say for sure that this wallet is RFID secure. I hope so, and maybe one day I will test it. This I do know.  It is a very nice wallet and it holds everything I need, including my checkbook.  It closes easily, is not bulky, and fits nicely inside my purse.  It is not cheap-looking and, in fact, is nice enough to give as a gift.  If it truly is an RFID blocking secure wallet, then all the better."
5.0,Cute. But cheaply made. However for the price its perfect. I'm 145 5'5 got a small. It fit tight but good. I could of done a medium though to help the slit from being so high.
5.0,"perfect size , perfect color. Very pleased."
5.0,Es muy suave

5.0,"Great size, great look!  Very happy :)"
5.0,The color is nice and vibrant as in the picture and the material is soft and a bit stretchy. Just a bit snug for my taste I got an XL. when I wash it I don't think I will stick it in the dryer for fear that it may shrink . But I love it.
5.0,"I order this swim suit late Saturday night and received it yesterday. The shipping was extremely fast which was an amazing surprise! I was unsure if I would like this suit as I have not worn a two piece since my son was born 2.5 years ago.<br />It fit as expected for the most part. The bottoms are tight around the thighs but I'm sure the more I wear it, the better the fit will be around my thighs.<br />The top is not what I expected at all. While I still like it, I did not know that there was additional padding in it. I do wish there was more material around the back to tie it better. While I can tie it, those with a large chest width may not be able to tie it. Please keep this in mind when ordering this. I am normally a 16 so I ordered the 3xl and it was just right. I will definitely be recommending this swim suit to others who are trying to find the perfect suit!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and truthful opinion."
5.0,I love both of them
5.0,"Success is mine after buying these for gifts! Every person had to put it on and wear it and tell me all about how warm they will be when they wear it in the cold. When the ear flaps go down, the back part covers your neck.  Well-made!"
5.0,I like this band because you can wear it on any day. It‚Äôs comfortable and cute the only thing is that I recommend getting your size because I grabbed mine a little too large. Other than that this is a great buy!
5.0,"Great for casual wear, stretchy pants and flip flops, covers the butt. Light weight, for cool summer night."
5.0,Item was perfect!
5.0,Gave as gifts
5.0,"My husband loves them, great buy! He's a size 12"
5.0,I buy this for my daughter and she love it for school
5.0,Bought for my kid sister. Got a thumbs up from her.
5.0,Soft thin material ! It‚Äôs stretching and fits my baby well!
5.0,"These suckers have been a life saver. I tend to snap a lot of wire and usually end up throwing the bra away or pulling both wires out.  With these I don't have to, I just pull the old ones out and put the new ones in and they last a long time! 100% recommend!"
5.0,This wig was very reasonably priced for the quality.  It is a very light grey color-silver.  Had a nice wave to it straight out of the packaging.  It doesn't appear or feel stringy or harsh.Pleasantly surprised by how soft it is. I highly recommend this wig for costumes.
5.0,"Perfect for our Disney trip!  I cannot wait for my little belle to wear this. The size said 3-5 but it was actually 4-6 which is perfect!! Great quality, super soft material"
5.0,It‚Äôs dainty and perfect for daily wear.
5.0,They are so very comfortable and this time they were much more affordable.  I was looking for them in gold as well but they were out of stock.  I purchased something similar but it does not have the comfort level that this shoe has.
5.0,Love adjust
5.0,I bought this watch for a gift and I get it in time and look great for the price is good deal.
5.0,Light and warm
5.0,"I'm a 34D, wear medium or large shirts depending. This seems to fit maybe a teensy bit roomy, but I prefer that because I'm a little soft (: it's actually pretty flattering, and the material is thick enough that even the neon yellow bra I tried it on with wasn't particularly noticeable. I'm impressed, I bought this with doubts, but I'm trying for a &#34;Kawaii Baddie&#34; look. This is perfect."
5.0,Absolutely love these sunglasses...<br />Doug's wife....Sharon
5.0,Cart goes over bumps....friends rangefinder attached with a strap w/two magnets bounces out of cart....mine stays.....every time. Strong magnet ...good stitching.

5.0,The belt are great
5.0,"soft, comfy, nice design"
5.0,"Great shirt, nice quality!  Does seam to run a little big."
5.0,"Here on time, and fits well Thanks again"
5.0,"The vest is very comfortable,  it heats you up and makes you sweat. It's very hard to get on and off but if you want it snug you have to find the easiest way to get it off and on once you do its fine, you just need to get used to finding a way .I like the snug fit. It does what it says . üòâ"
5.0,This was a gift for my 19 year old granddaughter.  It fits perfect. She loved it.
5.0,Love Love Love
5.0,"Great dress. Will need a body shaper underneath though!<br /><br />5/11/17 just updating with photos.<br /><br />Ordered size 12 then returned it because it was too big, size 10 fit me better.<br /><br />I wear size 29 in jeans, 34b/c bust and i'm 5'6 it fit perfect with heels, in photo I'm wearing my flats.<br /><br />It fit a little loose in the tummy/hip area, other than that it was PERFECT. I received lots of compliments!<br /><br />Also, I did wear a slip underneath to hide my loose belly (had my second child 5 months before this photo was taken)."
5.0,"This belt fits nice and looks nice.  It snugs up my waistline without cramping it and holds my pants up great.  I hope that because of the web material instead of leather to buckle it, it will not get worn out like some of my previous belts that were not good quality.  I love it."
5.0,"My daughter wears at 4T normally and the small 4-6 size was a perfect fit (not too loose, not too tight). Really well made! Will last as a hand me down."
5.0,So cute and such a good price.
5.0,"Great dress for the price, very comfortable and cute!"
5.0,Great fit and comfort.
5.0,Got this as a present for my boyfriend and he loved it! It's definitely a big ring though so if you're going for subtlety this isn't what you want.
5.0,So adorable. Nice fabric and bright color.
5.0,"I get rave reviews every time I wear my new glasses. So cute.<br />Easy to order, great price and got the cute little pink/orange Kate Spade carrying case.<br />Took the frames to Costco and voila! Glasses at half price.<br />What's not to love???"

5.0,Very nice and cute blouse. Excellent to dinner out or hanging out with friends.<br />Love it fit very nice .
5.0,Comfiest pair of gloves I‚Äôve ever put on. The touch screen thing sucks because these gloves are way too big and it wouldn‚Äôt even work with my car touch screen.. other than that best gloves I‚Äôve ever owned
5.0,Beautiful brought Me And My Daughter One<br />Very Soft  Warm And Comfortable Wish they had more colors though
5.0,I LOVE IT. only thing is the connector knott in the back becomes loose and fell apart after one week. Simple fishermans knott will fix this.
5.0,"It's a perfect fit. Nice, long arms and normal length waist."
5.0,To big but diamonds shineüòä
5.0,These are really Beautiful glasses and you def can't beat the price! ..... And they look just like they do in the picture.
5.0,I‚Äôm literally obsessed with these leggings I have multiple colors and can‚Äôt stop buying them. They fit amazing and make your booty look great too!
5.0,"This is exactly what I have been looking for.<br />My daughter is at the age of being too big to carry, but not big enough for long distance walk. I hate to wait for stroller everytime getting off the airplane.<br />So, I have invested in GB Pockit stroller. It worked well, but it was an extra item to carry. When I saw this, I was so excited. The luggage is light but sturdy enough to carry my daughter (41 lbs and 46 inches long). There‚Äôs lot of room for 1gal bag of snacks, small blanket, extra clothes, medicines and ipad.<br />My daughter really likes this. She sat in it and asked me to push her around the house.<br />I am so thankful for this invention!!!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9d1a0586cb59273ec20feb2340d31ac9]] Absolutely love these pieces.<br />Can be used as an under blouse for work, or even a gym wear.<br />Not to mention the colors. Love them."
5.0,I love mine I wear it everyday it‚Äôs perfect for me beacuse I‚Äôm allergic to fake jewelry and normal crystal  necklaces make my skin green

5.0,Oeerfect
5.0,"Gave as Christmas gift, very t well received, would buy again."
5.0,Size down when buying Haflinger slippers because they stretch a bit within the first day of wear. These slippers are great! I wear size 11 shoes (men's) and the 43 size fits like a glove for feet.
5.0,"Love this sweater, and I get a lot of compliments on it.  You can dress it up for work or pair it with jeans.  Very comfy!"
5.0,"I bought 3 different solid colors in this dress because I loved the first one so much. I sized up as other reviews suggested. I'm 5'8"" 145# and the Large is just right. Dress hits me at the knee. The fabric is light but not see through. Mostly cotton so is comfortable. Recommended!"
5.0,Very cute tunic! Well made for the price. I've gotten a lot of compliments. Good for wearing with skinny jeans or leggings.
5.0,These shorts were absolutely comfortable! The green color is the same as pictured and they fit perfectly.

5.0,This was what I have been looking for a long time.
5.0,"I'm a mom, and I have a bit of a pouch still. Figuring out a new wardrobe has been hell, because there are things I don't want to look so bad, obviously. I LOVE this skirt, it's so comfortable, I don't see my pouch, and it looks very classy! I wear it with a turtleneck shirt, and I feel fantastic in it!"
5.0,"I like having a piece that doesn't have to go on my ear, because I didn't feel like getting any more holes pierced in my ears. Have gotten many compliments on it, and people are surprised it is just a cuff. Way easier than an actual earring, and adds a little pretty detail to an ordinary ear/pair of earrings."
5.0,"True to size,nice and thin,armholes not too large"
5.0,"Love how stretchy these are. Comfy. Wish they were a bit tighter around the legs, but otherwise they‚Äôre great!"
5.0,Love this top!  I have a red one and a black one.  I wish it were just a little bit longer but I love them and will definitely order again!
5.0,I CANNOT believe how warm these were! We were digging out our truck for a half hour and I was in wait deep snow the entire time and didn't feel like it at all. These are absolutely amazing for the price.
5.0,"the t shirt fits perfect, I have no complaints at all."
5.0,Very nice good for the price.
5.0,"These shoes are adorable.  They fit perfectly and amazingly, stay on my grandson's feet.  No other shoes or socks for that matter have stayed on before.  My baby is just learning to walk and he is comfortable standing up and scooting around in these shoes.  I am very pleased."

5.0,Fit exact and good quality
5.0,"My boyfriend absolutely loved it! A little big and a pain to resize, but when resized it was perfect!"
5.0,"Ok, I have a big head! And right now I have REALLY long thin braids. I would not wear this with that style for fear in breaking it. BUT when my hair is regular it will look great<br /><br />The fastener in the back is like a necklace... It has a claw hook and the long loops or rope so that you can fasten it as loose or as tight as you like. It's easy to<br />Put on or to figure out what goes where. If your good with fashion you can wear it casual or dressy"
5.0,"I really like this gear bag, it's real roomy, you can fit a lot of stuff."
5.0,"You will not be disappointed! Ordered my normal size L & fit just right, to perfectly lay & be flattering. Length is exactly right & even vee neck is perfect lay, because on some tops, I have to safety pin opening, for work, to make more appropriate, but not this one. Will be ordering more colors!"
5.0,"Great belt for the price. 2mm thick plates with pretty good details on them. Ordered for a friend, but he already had it, so I got to send it back. But I would totally recommend this to any wrestling fan!"

5.0,Really cute i just love it!
5.0,"Great slip, offers just the coverage I need."
5.0,This wallet is beautiful just the art work done on it is amazing. The leather not the best but will do. One thing you will have to secure the chain and pull because mine came off. It was not secured tightly. If you can by pass this then you have a beautiful wallet.
5.0,"I have been working out at a gym for the past 3years.  I wore another kind of yoga pants until they wore out.  I thought I would have to leave the house and go shopping  to find something.  I do not like shopping and felt I was stuck in the cycle of picking out pants and them trying them on- a process I do not like that sometimes can take so much time.  So I looked on Amazon and looked at a few pairs of pants.  I read the reviews on these. decided on the size and ordered them.  That took a total of about 30 minutes.  To my surprise and great joy they fit perfectly.  They are comfortable, soft, and attractive.  I am 67 years old and just kind of wondered what I would look like in these.  I can give those young girls in the gym a run for their money in these LOL!  Seriously, I would buy these pants again and again.  Very pleased and so glad I bought these.  5 stars and beyond!!."
5.0,"Got fir my 3 year old, i sized up and I'm happy I did. Very soft and nice colors"

5.0,"spherical, great detail. I keep with me"
5.0,Great product!!  Perfect item for venue launch. Had several people ask me about how to get them and if they could be branded. The charger  makes them even better so you can wear them over and over.
5.0,"Good quality, great fit.  Wore it several times at the pool."
5.0,Husband loves it. Very Warm. He is 5‚Äô11 150lbs he had to get a x-large.
5.0,I think this necklace is cute but the pendant fell out and I had to get another
5.0,"So glad I ordered these! They are a beautiful soft ""Blue and Lavender Paisley Print!"". I have two perfect color tops that match with these pants. they fit comfortably and look nice and summery! I love Gloria Vanderbilt ""Amanda"" Jeans and Capri Jeans as they always have a nice fit to them and look flattering."
5.0,"The stitching in the crotch area was already loose and coming undone out of the box, had to re-stitch by hand. Personally the butt and crotch area could've been a little roomier."
5.0,The best socks ever. My feet have been swelling cuz of bad circulation I put these socks on and within an hour my feet are back to normal. I will definitely be getting more. Oh and they are super cute.
5.0,"I like this snap even more after I got it, was just what I was looking for."
5.0,My daughter loves this necklace and wears it every day!  Great quality.
5.0,beautiful w/the Pandora bracelet quick ship
5.0,"I took a chance and ordered this sweater because it was 34"" long.  I'm a 5'10"" lady that rarely can find sweater or top that covers my bum and that the arms are long enough. This sweater does both!!!! It is a perfect fit. I ordered size xxL.<br />So impressed that I bought 3 more.<br />I raly go crazy and spend the money, but, when I find something that fits this well- I do. Perfect for work or leisure. Haven't washed yet but it will be delicate and maybe line dry."

5.0,Bought these as a gift for my son.<br />He raved about them . Said they were very comfortable and loved the quality of the socks.<br /> I could tell when I was wrapping them how nice the quality was and  the price was amazing !!!!<br />Would definitely purchase this brand again.
5.0,I really have enjoyed these earrings! They looks nice and have held up well. I have been wearing one of them for several months now with no bad effects. I have had some real metal issues in the past so I am very cautious  over jewelry. I am very pleased and I get compliments on it often!
5.0,"These were a great accessory for my D.Va costumes. The material didn't feel very cheap, just some simple wood. Painted very nicely and all around was great."
5.0,‚ù§Ô∏è this dress!!!
5.0,Looks good on the Nokia/Withings Steel - Activite watch. Very easy to pop in and out.
5.0,Got the size '4' for my 2 year old boy.  They are a little large now but he wears them and will grow into them.  They are super easy to put on and take off due to the large Velcro opening and are great protection to have for little hands learning to ride bikes!
5.0,So pretty and fits as expected!
5.0,Another great buy!
5.0,I have six pairs of these in various colors. I absolutely love them. They are comfortable and flattering.
5.0,"ADORABLE!!<br />I cant believe they were so cheap. They look high quality. Time will tell how well they hold up, but they look and feel fantastic!! Very impressed!!"
5.0,I use these in my walking shoes so my laces don't always come untied. I used to have to stop and tie my shoe laces<br />a lot. No more. Great product!!

5.0,"Got this for my sons birthday, great material/quality, fits perfectly got the size he would usually wear in anything else definitely meets my expectations"
5.0,I'm already loving this suit and havent even worn it out yet. The polka dots are cute and retro and everything about this suit is modest and adorable. I love that I can feel comfortable as a 2x on the beach in this beautiful piece!
5.0,Perfect dark sunglasses
5.0,Great socks for air travel and long days on your feet.<br />Keeps my ankles from swelling as much.
5.0,"I normally wear a small, medium if I want a loose fit.  I ordered  xl after reading reviews and fit is great but would be tight if I wore anything bulky.  So definitely size up!"
5.0,"I am üíØ satisfied with this purchase and I'm so excited to wear it! I have replaced my purse with this bag for now since I have an infant, and purchased this backpack to use as a diaper bag. I haven't had a backpack in a long time, so I was excited to find this one! I was a bit nervous about the straps, initially, but they are actually very well made and the hardware is sturdy. Only time will tell how sturdy. I love the anti theft style. The pockets are substantially large holding enough room for my Galaxy note 9. I'm using this bag for my diaper bag. As you can see, it is small-medium, but has plenty more room for other items in the bag. It's not thermal, but I don't care about that as I make bottles as I go.¬† I love the color, the style, the size and the pack isn't too bulky. I do not like bulky backpacks/diaper bags. My husband even wears it and has commented on how light and comfortable it is. GET THE BAG!"
5.0,"Love the design, and the shirt was very soft. I have washed it a few times now and it still looks Great!! JUST BUY IT :)"
5.0,"These are some of the nicest tank tops I've ever bought. Perfect fit uptop and long enough to reach under my big ole man butt.<br /><br />Are they worth the price? 100%, yes"
5.0,"I live in Los Angeles, Ordered this Saturday and received it Monday!<br />Packaged very safely and even included a cute little surprise.<br /><br />The piece looks great and hopefully it holds up well :)"

5.0,Boyfriend loves it
5.0,Fits perfect and good quality. I love it.
5.0,very good case excellent quality
5.0,"I love the amber shaded lenses, and the cool design on the side. The glasses seem to be pretty sturdy and they fit comfortably.<br /><br />Update: after a year of lots of wear, they finally broke. They broke from a toddler &#34;playing&#34; with them. I'm sure they would have lasted longer if they didn't get snatched up by a kiddo. I will miss them."
5.0,Very Saitisfied with this item. I mean it's everything. I reccomend you get this as a gift or if You're Grenadian it's a must have! Love love love my new Jewelry. ‚ù§‚ù§üëå
5.0,"Love this button up! I have been on the hunt for a cute plaid shirt that fit my taste (I am very picky about plaid). This one is similar to am H&M brand I love, but just a little over half the price.<br /><br />Sizing is NOT Asian sizing and is true to fit. I ordered a medium as I typically wear a small to medium. I prefer to size up on button ups because I have a small waist (26 inch) but wear a 32 DD bust. I don't like my shirt to pull at the bust.<br /><br />The construction of the shirt is good, and I had no issues with dye runs. My only complaint which is a personal preference were that the sleeves were a bit too oversized for my personal taste and this is more of a boyfriend fit than a fitted button up. Overall though, its an extremely cute and comfortable casual shirt. I did not have the issue of it being too short (the front almost completely covered my crotch and the back is longer than the front and covered my butt) but I am only 5&#34;2 and petite.<br /><br />For the price I think it is a good buy. I plan to wear it with a black boyfriend blazer and black skinnies."
5.0,"Heavier weight than I expected, very nice dress. Well made. The red is more of a dark coral than a red, but still very beautiful. I'm 5'3&#34; and will need to wear very high heels. Would be great for someone on the tall side."
5.0,Its quality is great and my son loved it
5.0,"I got this fur my husband‚Äôs one year sober to hold his Celebrate Recovery coin and also as a ‚Äúleather anniversary gift.‚Äù It is perfect! He‚Äôs almost at 2 years, and it has held up really well!"
5.0,it is exactly what I wanted
5.0,"Hesitant on buying clothes online, but it fit great and the color is beautiful. I like how it‚Äôs a little heavier fabric and not thin like most sweaters. Totally gonna buy more in other colors"
5.0,"Greatt for steel toed boots.  Nice and warm plus they support your feet while you work.  I bought these for my husband for work for the nights that are really cold.  He told me they are the best socks he's ever worn for when it does get cold out.  We live in Houston and we only have about  2 to 3 months of winter.  Our winter is cold, rainy, and damp to the bone. He saud they would also work well for humting.  Now if I could just find some of these for all our hot days, but thinner and just as supportive as well as dry wicking.  I highly recommend these for cold weather and steel toed boots."
5.0,"Fits perfectly, looks much more expensive than it was.  Got it in two days.  Think I will get some more colors."
5.0,Love these breathable child masks! I made them personalized with my Cricut vinyl cutter. They turned out so cute!

5.0,"Great deal, good product. All good thank you"
5.0,I got my necklace and I love it!! It's dainty but that's what I wanted. It was well worth the price!
5.0,"This is well-made, and definitely not thin, cheap material. The XXL fit fine. I am usually a 2xl, so sizing is true. Pockets fit inside dress well and do not bulge like some do. Only thing wrong is that it is a little tight on the upper belly, which is not a surprise to a large woman. Sleeves also work pulled up at elbow length."
5.0,Super cute in person. Good quality for the price.
5.0,Perfect sweat pants. Great fit and light weight for Florida evenings.
5.0,Gorgeousvwatch. Looks very expensive. It can be worn casually or dressed up. Its lovely. And for the price. What a steal!

5.0,It was a gift for my husband. He likes it.
5.0,Great party hats.
5.0,It arrived in 2 days and just in time for an expected cool snap here. Perfect for my early morning walks/runs with my dogs.
5.0,"Light and silky like,  but yet warm and comfortable.  Easy to pack and wash without shrinkage.  I bought two more in different patterns. Great for travel at hotels when room temperatures vary or hanging out at home."
5.0,"I love it. A bit bigger size that I expected, but totally worth it."
5.0,Like the ability to put on using the snaps on either side as opposed  to having to put over the head.
5.0,"This is such a cute dress that I ordered to use as a bathing suit cover up. I am 5'3, 135-140lbs with a 28' waist, and a size small fit me well. If you're looking for a looser fit, I would get the size you normally would, but if you want it to be a bit more form fitting, get a size smaller. I wore it to the beach on a summer morning, so the weather was around mid-80s. While the dress itself was comfortable, the sleeves definitely made it feel warmer. Therefore, I would recommend this dress with slightly cooler weather. It is extremely comfortable and soft. The tie on the side is adjustable to make the ""hole"" in the side smaller or larger. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a cute beach dress."
5.0,The fabric is good and strong but not heavy. The style is boho cute. Looking for the right top to wear it with boots in March while it‚Äôs still cool to cold.
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous! Fabric quality is much better than what is offered in most stores. I am 5'8&#34;, 200 lbs, 40D bust, and 35&#34; waist and I got the XXL. I might try the XL next time because the top is a bit roomy. I followed the size chart and read what other commenters recommended. But I am very happy with my purchase! I will definitely buy from Miusol again!"
5.0,"It was a great quality. I ordered for my twin grandsons, it fit them perfectly!"
5.0,"I have been looking for brown pull-on jeans and found them!  They are very very comfortable and I love them!  I needed to shorten them as I did not buy petite.  (Wasn't sure they would be long enough, but  Next time I will!"
5.0,Love this glasses.
5.0,To cute
5.0,"I bought this dress for summer wear and have really enjoyed the ease and softness of it.  Sleeves were not too short, skirt length was perfect for a relaxed day with friends or grandkids or even around the house."
5.0,"It‚Äôs so cute,beautiful color, kids Like it."
5.0,They are sturdier than most readers in this price range and we love the colors!
5.0,Great value and they look great on me
5.0,Great price. Great style. Sturdy and comfortable.
5.0,I LOOK LIKE A SAINT NOW...
5.0,"I love it and the price was right , how ever  it has already broke the clasp is very delicate and did not last.  I am planing to fix it and wear it again."
5.0,Yyaaasssss I want every single pattern and color this boo is so cute and amazing
5.0,Bought this a few days before my Christmas party with horrible expectations - buying a dress online with only a day or two to fix how you look - we all know itll be a disaster. BUT when this dress came it fit perfect and was the rave of the office party! For the price and the quick shipping I couldnt be happier with the item! Will be purchasing again and recommending to all my friends!
5.0,They fit how I though they was gonna fit they not that thin material In your butt cheeks not coming out of them üòâ good fit
5.0,I have another pit of Sam Edelman ballerina flats in size 7 but I had to get size 6.5 in these. Weird but I love them both!
5.0,Excellent quality and material. Will definitely do business again!
5.0,"This shirt is perfect! I was afraid the small/medium would be too small but it has a great stretch to it! And the tightness makes it really nice to wear without a bra, as the shirt holds my breasts up really well! I plan to buy in at least one more color."
5.0,"I got this as a Christmas gift from my husband who knows my tastes very well. I love it, I have tried it on already and it is nice and soft and is not too tight. I do not have a huge neck (double chin) but it is not as small and skinny as it use to be when I was much younger either. It does fit nice and does not feel too tight or too loose.<br /><br />I can not speak to its integrity much yet because I just got it yesterday but if for any reason it falls apart or breaks I will return and amend my post but other than that I love it and am very pleased with my new choker."
5.0,"The fit was perfect for me, though initially I was worried they felt a little tight. They are very heavily padded and thus very comfortable in the winter months."
5.0,My girlfriend loved it and carries it with her wherever she goes. 100% would recommend
5.0,this watch is nice
5.0,This dress is perfect! Excellent value for the price. I am so happy!
5.0,Purchased for the whole family for Christmas. Exactly as described and very happy with purchase!
5.0,"I like these very much.  The leashes are a good length, it has an adjustable keeper, and the rubber connectors on the glasses seem rugged and not likely to slip.  Time will tell if the rubber continues its grip as it ages."
5.0,Fits nicely and looks super cute!
5.0,Comfy I now can play emperor Palpatine with no complaints
5.0,"I bought these for my 9 year old grandson.  Happily, they work for him and he is seeing some colors for the first time!  It has been a joyful experience for him and for our family!  I would like to see a better range of sizes in these glasses.  The children's say they fit age 5 to 10.  I bought him women's small and they are a bit too large but children's size would have been too small."
5.0,"I paired these with the 3/4 length tunics in this same brand and they match pefectly. Love Love ! Lightweight, comfy,  I wear leggings and legging style capris, so these cover my bottom but not too long. Love the material for summer in air conditioned restaurants. I like this brand and apparently many do,  because I see Out Of Stock a lot. True to size also."
5.0,"this dress, the color, the fit, the comfort, the classy look, all of it and for the Most Amazing Price EVER!!!!! LOVE IT~"
5.0,awesome!
5.0,"This is a soft and really well-fitting shirt. I love the uneven hemline--it adds a little more style than a simple tshirt.<br /><br />The hem is pleated at the bottom. It hugs my post partum belly pudge in place--and kind of molds around it. I'm sure it will be more flattering once my pudge is gone.<br /><br />The sleeves are longer than tshirt sleeves and have a nice hem as well. There are also pleased in the back to help the top move very nicely--great flowiness.<br /><br />Apricot is pretty much offwhite.<br />Overall, I'm very happy with this shirt!<br /><br />Product provided by seller for review purposes"
5.0,The colors are so vibrant and will go with many colors and any season.
5.0,I haven't worn it yet but it fits and the material is so soft. Can't wait to wear with some leggings. Great buy and quality for the price.
5.0,Just perfect and comfy! Definitely recommend!! Thank you!
5.0,These shorts fit me very well. They are very comfortable.
5.0,Love these sunglasses! I bought two pair from this company and love both styles. One will go in my car and one in my summer bag. Both are well made and chic and include a great carry case and cleaning cloth.
5.0,They are very comfortable and the smell isn't bad at all. Just the rubber sole.
5.0,Great white shirt
5.0,"The fit was perfect , many colors to choose from"
5.0,"It's the perfect length, coming down above my knee, and it's super soft! Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,I wear a 14/16 in US women's. I ordered this plus size because I have a hard time finding dresses that are not so short they literally are T-SHIRT length! This dress was PERFECT. It came to mid-thigh and was bodycon style throughout.  (Without being too tight)
5.0,Cuter than I thought it would be & comfortable although I need to get a larger size. The medium is too small for 34ddd.
5.0,I recommend very comfortable and ran true to size good quality and great price
5.0,"Beautiful costume. Well made. My niece loves it, especially the train. Price is very reasonable."
5.0,"I've literally tried hundreds of tank tops<br /><br />These are like champion (baggier near the bottom), but a lot more thin and breathable<br /><br />Ordered a L, tag says XL. Fits perfect, must be Chinese sizing."
5.0,Only needed one but had to buy a pair.
5.0,"The material its made of looks legit,not cheap! I like how it fits me and emphasize my curves. Beautiful for weddings,semiformal or even funeral!"
5.0,"The case is more attractive in person. It fits well and will hold 3 cards and a few bills. The case is well made and flexible so that it can be folded easily for portrait view. Also, you are able to take pictures with this case on without weird coloration, artifacts, or shadows on your photos."
5.0,Love this watch.  Pretty and sparkly.  My only complaint is that it‚Äôs hard to pull out the stem to set the time.
5.0,Very please with this purchase. Compliments the costume well!
5.0,The label maker is easy to setup and use with Bluetooth on my phone. The case is sturdy and keeps everything needed to use the label maker together.
5.0,This is my second set of these gauges their really good for the price they don‚Äôt have a an odd smell and you have lots of variety don‚Äôt recommend sleeping with them on as they will pop out as u sleep that being said you will lose some while doing activities I‚Äôve had mine pop out putting on my motorcycle helmet and swimming so they are good for show if u plan on doing high intensity activities I recommend you take them out if their was a way to secure them better that would be awesome but I have no complaints I really enjoy these pieces
5.0,Bella is so cute in this
5.0,These socks are great. Just the right length. Support without binding. Extremely comfortable!
5.0,Perfect color and price. I love it. Also the shipment was very fast
5.0,Excellent to hang on the rearview mirror of your car. It comes with a sticker.
5.0,Beautiful. This is now my favorite dress. It fits well.
5.0,"Sexy, soft, comfortable, and figure flattering. Good quality material. Good buy for the price."
5.0,"These are the best leather belts. Not only do they say they use high quality materials, but they actually do use high quality materials. Let's talk about the buckle first. The metal is the perfect shade of rustic gold. It is thick and durable and, it is nice to see that is not small, insignificant or over the top. Now the belt, this leather has a good shine to it and the embossing is state of the art. It is exactly what I said about the buckle the perfect color, thick and durable. I love that you can wear this casual or dress attire. My husband never purchases his own belts. He hates shopping and when he does he will pick the cheapest not just in cost but in product too. So, no worries, I know what size he is and the sizing on this is exactly USA. This is the third belt I have ordered from this company and he hasn't been disappointed yet and I love the way they look on him. This belt is built to last, even the belt loop is thicker than most others. I couldn't find any flaws in this belt so it definitely deserves the five stars. I hope this review is helpful for you in your decision to purchase."
5.0,Perfect sneaker for the beginner walker with fat feet.  They stay on my sons feet unlike other sneakers .  I would definitely recommend the sneakers .
5.0,All I hoped it would be!!
5.0,I love these socks for my mules.  I've worn mules with no socks but I unfortunately have sweaty feet so I was desperately search for something to help.  These are awesome!
5.0,I love this dress! You can dress it up or down.
5.0,"I love this dress !!! I am 5 foot 5 230lbs and bought a large and fits loose just like the pic also my measurements are 38, 34, 53 and I wear it all the time it is my go to dress I‚Äôm actually wearing the dress right now as I‚Äôm typing this"
5.0,These socks are amazing!  I have thrombosis in my legs and blood pool ed at my feet.  Put these on and you don't feel them on.  Work better than medical grade stocking.  Takes great  care of the swelling and not hot even in summer.  Ordered multiple packs for discount and each came with coupon for more.  Been holding up well a really great buy!
5.0,"Let me start by saying that I received this product at a discount. I want to be upfront with that, and add that I only accept products that I think I‚Äôll like and have no problem with giving a negative review if the product warrants it. If the product fails to meet expectations later, or holds up even better than I‚Äôd hoped, I‚Äôll update.<br /><br />I purchased this top for my lovely wife, and she loves it. She is headed out on a trip tonight, and was in the middle of packing when we got the package. She tried it on, gushed over it, and said &#34;This is coming with me.&#34; Coming from her, it really doesn't get much better than that!<br /><br />The material is light, soft, and flowing; but it isn't so light that it is see through. She tells me that it was a very comfortable fit, and very comfortable fabric. She loves the lacy top too which shocked me because she doesn't usually go for that kind of thing. We'll see how it holds up over time, but the seams look good, and while the fabric isn't anything like denim, I expect it to hold up fairly well under regular usage. You know, unless it snags on something, but that is just the risk you ladies take to look and feel good.<br /><br />So all in all the shirt feels good to her and it makes her feel good. I can't ask for more or give it higher praise, except to say that I think she looks great in it too."
5.0,This dress looks amazing on me! Great dress to wear at work and is very comfortable.
5.0,Very nice and soft shirt.  Perfect match to my light pink capri's.  Happy with this purchase
5.0,Excellent material and nice dress
5.0,Great fit and color
5.0,This was a very pretty scarf. My friend loved it.
5.0,Very comfortable and soft material
5.0,My daughter loves these chained bracelet designs. I like how they look & how they make her wrist look pretty.
5.0,Timely delivery. ...just as described
5.0,"I love love love this watch.  Its sturdy, is easy to read time/date, feels great (I almost don't know its there sometimes),  looks better and is very well made.  I have about 8 watches and this has become without thinking about it the one I put on almost every day."
5.0,Love this bag because I am obsessed with the Joker so why not get this bag? This from England so overseas for me and it didn‚Äôt take long to receive it. Great seller and great product
5.0,"Bought this as a birthday gift for my sister, who is tall wnd has trouble finding shirts long enough. This was a hit with her. She loved it. It fit perfectly, the material is so soft and comfortable, and the colors are fun."
5.0,"I love these goggles! They make it so much easier to see on those sunny, snow filled landscapes to get around.! I use them while riding my ATV.<br />It really helps to define the snow landscape so you do not end up in a drift! That's no fun. Great goggles, and reasonably priced. You would pay a much higher amount at any ski store."
5.0,This boot is the perfect fit and so comfortable ! Doesn't even feel like I have a boot on !  Would totally recommend this boot !!
5.0,"I bought these socks for myself and my other half. We frequently travel long distances. The last few years, my feet were always swollen after flying. A friend suggested that I try compression socks. I lick socks made out of cotton so that my feet can breathe. I found these socks on Amazon. We used them for our recent trip to Germany. What a difference they made! I wore them for 15 hours ( travel to and from airport plus flight time) and my feet felt really good. I did not have the typical swelling of my feet. I would buy them again."
5.0,This was a gift my daughter wanted to get her 4th grade teacher. Her teacher loved it.
5.0,"Great seller!!  When my item didn‚Äôt work for me, Ella worked hard at making sure my refund came through. Thanks!!"
5.0,"I have very, very short hair and this hat is incredibly warm...in the best way.  The fleece lining (even though it's sewn just around the head band) really does a great job of containing the heat all the way into the cap portion.  What's great is that the fleece part of the hat can also be pulled down over my ears comfortably.  The overall construction is solid and of good yarn quality with the slouchy portion sewn into that position."
5.0,"hard to find the larger sizes in base layers, tried these and was happy that they fit great. The first day out in the weather hubs said they were excellent and to keep them coming so I will definitely be looking for more. Great Value!"
5.0,Great fit and comfortable. Love the color.
5.0,"I ordered the blue for my 3.5 year old who is 32 pounds and 3‚Äô2‚Äù tall. It is a nice modest length & has a decent amount of coverage. The inside is a thin linen fabric with the outside being a sturdy lace. It is perfect for spring/summer as it is light & airy, but would need tights/jacket for fall/winter. The stitching was not all that great & I only intend to hand wash/spot clean as I would imagine it would fall apart in the washing machine. The fluff balls on the trim is also super adorable! Decent dress for a decent price!"
5.0,I made sure to measure my niece before buying and this fit her perfectly! I am so happy with everything it came with and would totally buy her other bathing suits from this brand
5.0,Not bad. I like it. They're comfortable
5.0,Sized just right and the most comfortable board shorts I have ever worn!!
5.0,"I love this dress, the small fit as expected and it's so comfortable. I love that it has pockets, that's a huge bonus!"
5.0,Perfect fit in my Romer II frames.  Arrived ahead of promised date.
5.0,Great love it!
5.0,Leggings Depot is the best for better than butter soft comfort at a reasonable price. Very nice selection of prints.
5.0,"Great socks!!! I have enjoyed Cloudline for hiking but now prefer them for my running socks, as well."
5.0,"Nice color, comfortable."
5.0,Took a part time job where I have to endure 3 hours of the Midwest weather. I had an older pair of UGS I started the season with but with below zero layering required even they took a beating. Knowing the layers I needed I went up a full size instead of my usual 1/2 size up for boots & I am so so pleased with this purchase. Definitely would recommend.
5.0,"I have not worn the skirt at this time because weather does not permit, but I have tried it on and I love the fit. I don't want to rush summer but I cannot wait until winter. I will be warm and fashionable"
5.0,"I saw that several people complained about a strong odor coming from this scarf.  When I received the scarf this morning and opened the package there was a VERY strong chemical odor.  I love the scarf but knew I couldn't wear it like this, so I put it in the dryer set to air with two fabric softener sheets for 10 minutes and when I took it out the odor was completely gone!!!  It fact it smells great,"
5.0,Having fun with them.
5.0,Todo mucho pretty. I love it.
5.0,Really cute. Really comfy. Stays in place on my wrist well. Doesn‚Äôt sweat like the silicone bands.  Overall it‚Äôs a great product. Will definitely be getting more of these.
5.0,Bought for vacation and it was perfect! I got so many compliments and felt beautiful in it.
5.0,"Great shorts, great quality. But run large ..."
5.0,"This bracelet was bought as a birthday gift for a friend.  It is such a beautiful bracelet, great quality, sparkles beautifully, nice and heavy. Would highly recommend if you're a Michael Kors fan!"
5.0,I loveeeee this dresss! My new fav!
5.0,"I love my case, it exceeded my expectations, it is perfect for when I don't want to carry my purse and it's big enough for my phone and money, I love it and have had it for several months and it almost takes the place of my purse! So happy I bought this!"
5.0,They fit really nice. Very pleased  with them. My grandson likes them.
5.0,It fits perfect and she loves it.
5.0,My daughter loves this dress.
5.0,I recently got these for my niece in a size 12 and she will be turning 6 with her birthday coming up and the weather to soon be shifting I thought she would love these. I had an adult version of these and they were super comfy and soft these look like just that and the material is a knit fabric with a fuzzy lining and top portion of the bootie. These also look like really good quality as well in person. I am very pleased with the look and feel of this product and cannot wait to gift it to my niece.
5.0,"5'5, 240. This is my favorite swimsuit! Thick material, double lined in the front. The design was very flattering. No underline, but the tightness keeps everything in place. Not as high as I'd like in the back but that's because I have junk in the trunk. I'd buy this suit in 100 different styles."
5.0,THE best eye mask. Completely solved my problem with neighbor's light. Thank you!
5.0,Good belt.  Wear it everyday and it is in great shape still
5.0,So beautiful! Everything I hoped they would be. üòç
5.0,Belt is made very well from high grade leather. supports holster very well.
5.0,I saw this Disney Tree on Pinterest and decided I wanted to do the same it just so happened that the top of the tree had this hat (the cherry on top) PERFECT!!
5.0,"These shoes are very comfortable and fit perfectly.  I love the colors and the style.  However, they are sold as Zumba shoes and they are more like tennis shoes."
5.0,I love the shape and color of these. Very sturdy. Comes with a cloth holder to keep clean and safe.
5.0,"I just received these and unfortunately Arizona is overcast today so a true test would be best with full sun, maybe tomorrow. These improve my vision and my wife's bright white car does not blind me after looking at it for a full minute. Right now I'm very happy with with these glasses and so no reason not to be even happier on bright sunny days."
5.0,Love love love it‚Äôs excatly what it say it is! Fits great and quality is on point!! Thank you thank you!
5.0,So soft .. so beautiful
5.0,Really complimented the dress and belt. Very pretty and eye catching!
5.0,Bought for my wife and she absolutely loves it. wears it everywhere.
5.0,Funny...but for MInnesota snow shoveling for my grand son...fun and warm.
5.0,"I have extreme  arthritis in my bilateral thumbs. I have used magnetic bracelets for 15 yrs, but never a natural stone bracelet. It works just as well. Beautiful bracelet. I got the 8inch, but the 7inch would have fit close to my wrist better. I had a volar plate and 5 screws put in my left wrist for a fracture 3 months ago, and it is still stiff. Hoping this might help with healing."
5.0,"I generally wear a large in sweatshirts, but this large was much too wide.  The medium fits just right, but I wish both were a little longer.  I love how they feel!"
5.0,I like it and it came fast.
5.0,"I like it, it's actually a very nice looking and feeling bag  for the price.  now that said, it's a little smaller then i would have liked but that's on me.  I would say it can handle a pair of shoes, one outfit and a dopp kit but that's the room you get.  nice bag though in structure and looks."
5.0,Best little watch I've ever owned.
5.0,"Just as the HDE Pattern Suspenders, this bowtie is great for what you pay for it. Best part of my costume."
5.0,"I love my supra the are stylist and very very comfortable. I wear them at work and home, always get compliments."
5.0,They are just alil big but thats perfect cuz at 2 and a half yes old there feet grow fast so its üëç good.
5.0,"Perfect, love it!"
5.0,I ordered this necklace as I love the initial ones. The necklace falls perfectly. You have a lead that can make it longer if you choose to. Color is great. 18kt gold covered. Will last a long time. Comes in a small cloth bag for storage. I would purchase from them again.<br />I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest unbiased review.
5.0,Perfect Thanks !
5.0,Totally worth the $ sooo cute. Will buy more!
5.0,"I am 5'2"" bra size 32FF UK sizing (which translates to 32H US sizing) my measurements are 39 (across bust)-29-35 I  am pretty busty with narrow hips and a short torso. (I know when I am looking at reviews height and weight are NOT helpful since we all carry weight differently.  So I included all my measurements for a more accurate representation.)<br /><br />Hands down....This suit is fabulous!  I saw it advertised as a good suit for larger chests and it is perfect! I did a scoop and swoop into the top and it fits so SO good.  I got a small (because with my narrow hips I didn't want the butt to be saggy) and a medium (because that is what I figured I would have to get to fit my chest) and the small fit perfectly.  So I would definitely say true to size with generous coverage for a busty gal! The medium fit ok in the top but was very saggy in the butt- which I expected.<br /><br />The suit itself is made really well with beautiful vibrant fabric.  I didn't love the cups that came with so I took them out.  I was unsure which patten to choose and when I saw this floral on other reviewers I feel in love-it is gorgeous!<br /><br />Also, the buckle on the waist shirring is movable! I didn't like that it was right on the middle of my belly and was pleasantly surprised that I could move it! So I slid it over to where the crossover part was on the top and love it now :)"
5.0,Very nice just not true to size... Was only able to wear once.
5.0,Love this it's adorable!!!
5.0,These have held up to my toddler so they are durable. We love the bright colors. I think they are good quality. They would make a very nice gift as well.
5.0,"Very nice, many nice comments!"
5.0,"Excellent build quality, protection, fit, and value. I am 5' 10"" and 190 lbs, and the Large fit very well. Nice liner and style."
5.0,love!
5.0,fit snug on my face. This summer well tell how they work.
5.0,This shirt is of the highest quality and people actually think the person wearing it is a professional. Added details are well placed and do not over power the clothing. It is well packaged and arrived even before the stated delivery date.
5.0,This product was a gift. My nephew absolutely loves them!
5.0,"These are good for dressing up or for a casual day. They go good with any season,  especially fall.  They are lightweight,  yet durable. I have many pairs of tassel earrings and these are by far the Mose comfortable pair yet."
5.0,Works very well with my blue light glasses and wearing a face mask at the grocery store. Definitely recommend this brand over any other! 10/10
5.0,Perfect fall shoes to wear with everything!
5.0,"I bought this shirt in a medium for my husband and he normally wears a medium. The shirt feels like good quality, nice and soft. He hasn't tried it yet as it is a gift and I'm waiting till Valentines to give it to him. However, the print is exactly as seen. The concept is soo cute and the price is within budget to buy a daddy and baby shirt. Perfect for new dads and perfect for pizza lover!"
5.0,So nice - perfect size and clarity
5.0,"This is a beautiful dress. I was happy when the seller reached out to me for my measurements to ensure I  had a proper fitting dress. They did an amazing job with the customization.  It fit beautifully.  The jacket fit just right.  My only issue was the lace was white and not silver or gray like the picture. I really needed the lace to not be white lace. Other than that I love it. I cannot wear it to my daughter's wedding because of the white lace, but I will wear it to another event. I do hope to buy other dresses from this seller exclusively!"
5.0,"Love this dress so much, I bought it in 3 colors so far haha. It fits perfectly and is very slimming. It's also durable and seems very well made. No complaints!"
5.0,TOOO CUTE
5.0,"The earrings I received are pretty, but not like the photo.  They are also much bigger than I anticipated.  I am trying to determine if I will keep them or give them away as gifts.  They are worthy either way, but wish they were more like the photo."
5.0,Todo perfect
5.0,It's just perfect!  I really love the brooch.  Beautiful.
5.0,Beautiful. My most popular item at craft shows.
5.0,Love love them!!! The fit especially
5.0,Great dress! Lovely design and it fit great! Daughter loved it!!!
5.0,but cheap looking afraid it will break
5.0,super cute necklace
5.0,Great replacement pieces for a piece that always seems to wear out fast!  Multi-pack make it easy to replace when needed.
5.0,"Cute, flowy dress. You could add a Jean jacket and leggings for extra warmth or wear as is!"
5.0,"These earrings are gorgeous. They look like peacocks, they look like earrings. Strangers stop me to ask about them. I am so pleased. I'm a bit of a peacock myself."
5.0,I felt that they were a little too big ! But I like the design !
5.0,"shiny and very pretty, my daughter wore them for her wedding they were perfect"
5.0,Very comfortable and fits great! Would definitely buy again
5.0,Love this dress! I was hesitant because it seems to be quite new and had barely any review. It offers a free return so I took a gamble on it and I'm glad I did. It's well made and fits me perfectly--I received many compliments. The length is good too (knee-length) so I can wear this to work or church. I'm 5'4&#34; and 136 lbs and wearing size M. The material is stretchy and quite thick so no concern about it being see through.
5.0,El producto es bastante c√≥modo y ajustable
5.0,Very adorable  set. My 10 year old loved the heart shaped box that the earrings came in.
5.0,"Great product, soft material, firs as expected."
5.0,"I've worn suede boots for several years and had used an older kit with a white eraser and brush. It did OK, but didn't get all the stains out.  I ran across Woly Suede Gum while searching for another product.  It's more abrasive than the old one and does a really great job on suede.  I highly recommend it!"
5.0,It fits perfect.<br />A relative was going to throw it out because the color was not  cool anymore and the battery died.<br />Thank U millenial cuz.<br />Bought a band as well.<br />No pics for the finish.<br />It's all black though.<br />Again thanks cuz young people have no value in anything.<br />Lol.
5.0,This is a great coat! It is very well made and super warm and the print is clear and vibrant. I bought it on a whim during a lightening deal even though it didn't have any reviews at the time but I'm so glad I did! It looks very expensive and I'm so glad a took a chance on it.
5.0,Great socks and are very comfortable.
5.0,"Unexpected high quality, especially for the price.  I love my &#34;love&#34; necklace.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Great packaging & fits nicely
5.0,Very beautiful on! Highly recommended!
5.0,Great shades.  Mature and sophisticated.
5.0,"I love this dress. I bought it for a wedding, receive so many compliments. It fit to size. I can wear during Spring  & Summer day or night ( with little or no accessories. Perfect length."
5.0,"Love everything about it!!!! Fits perfectly, great material, well made, nice bright color. Didnt know this, but the hood is even removable by way of three buttons. Fantastic shirt/hoodie!"
5.0,I've used these on multiple trips and have been very satisfied with them.  Perfect for the beach and the pool.  I've walked around in them for a bit and  have had no issues.  About to order some additional pairs for future trips.
5.0,"This is the second one of these bands I have purchased. They are very comfortable, super adjustable with a simple slide. Good magnet strength...it stays put. Easy to put on by yourself. I find them stylish, especially compared to the clunky looking silicone ones. I also love the color choices, and the price point is great. The only negative would be that they can snag on your sleeves. I don't find that they snag on anything else...just certain long sleeves I'm wearing and usually only while I'm putting the shirt on and sliding my hand down the arm hole. The first band I bought got ruined because of this. The price point made it not a big deal to order another. Unless I find something else that is as comfortable and sleek..I'll keep using these. Shipping was super fast both times I ordered."
5.0,This wrap scarf is very soft and looks exactly as the picture provided.
5.0,Nice little wallet. Great quality material and finish.
5.0,Item as stated thanks!
5.0,Excelente hasta los momentos
5.0,"Good quality Hat. No Issues with the fit ( I have a small head)or quality.  The Olive color really is more of a dark army green than a tan like it seems in the picture, but I was even more happy with this color."
5.0,"My sisters love them so im very happy with the purchase, thanks!"
5.0,Works great for what I needed.
5.0,Very nice ring gotten soo many complements every where I  go and even some ask to take pictures with it...
5.0,"US Army issue for cold weather training. Super warm and the only item I'll wear (well, aside from my fleece when I'm lazy) outside of uniform."
5.0,"I work really long shifts and I'm working said really long shifts right before a convention. I decided I wanted to cosplay Keith. I always made my cosplays and this is my first time buying one. This jacket is a Godsend. I ordered it a few days ago and it arrived super-fast. The fit is also very true to size. It's well constructed for the price, is lined and even has shoulder pads (for us crossplayers!). The fabric feels a little cheap but, honestly it doesn't look bad at all and kind of looks like a realistic futuristic jacket. It just isn't the fabric I would've used if I'd made it. But I didn't, I bought it. So can't complain! But hey, it's a great price and I'm extremely pleased! &#60;3"
5.0,These pants are amazing! They fit perfectly and are unbelievably comfortable.
5.0,Great blue light glasses.  Ultra lightweight compare to other brands I tried - nice feature.  Make it easy to wear for long hours in door.  Nice fit.  Highly recommended.
5.0,"Gorgeous earrings, you nor anybody who sees them would guess the price. Sparky, nice weight. So glad I bought them!"
5.0,"Great quality, bright colors and absolutely beautiful all around"
5.0,"Great for the price, very nice and neat"
5.0,Very pretty. Fit a little tight.
5.0,Nice size. Just received yesterday & I love it!!!
5.0,It fits good.
5.0,Very good gift
5.0,"OOOH I just LOVE IT!  I hope the gold stays nice for a long time.  It is absolutely adorable, and it is adjustable,  it lays flat (doesn't flip around) I am VERY happy. It would make a wonderful gift for any bunny lover!"
5.0,I loved it!!!!
5.0,The style and fit are perfect
5.0,Fits amazing. Beautiful color
5.0,Week end
5.0,Very Cute and good quality socks!
5.0,This dress is my new favorite of all time. The fit is very flattering and so is the print!<br />I am 5'3&#34; and 179lbs and I ordered the Large! it was the perfect fit.
5.0,The fabric isnt as thick and heavy as it may look in the photo
5.0,My husband wears it all the time. Awesome hat!
5.0,Worked great! I‚Äôm very impressed and highly recommend purchasing.
5.0,It is beautiful and keeps perfect time.
5.0,"I ordered  this in November. It took so long to arrive but I refused to cancel my order. So glad I didn't. I received it today and immediately opened it up. It's great quality, looks nice and it's big. I have a lot of hair and it fits so nice. Definitely worth the wait. And I love representing my people."
5.0,Sexy and fun
5.0,My husband got this for me as a gift! It is simply gorgeous! The quality is incredible! And you can fit a lot in it. The purse comes with small bag. I use mine for my lipstick and mirror. Definitely a must have!
5.0,"This is a gorgeous corset! And sexy too! I ordered one size down as I am working out and therefore will be losing some weight, and I didn't want to have to buy another after the weight has gone. Haha! Also, well, this is a corset. It is suppose to fit like a glove, or even be a bit too small, as, well, it gives you more of an hourglass figure. And it is sexy as hell! I ordered the blue and yellow (and black,) as opposed to the all black because I loved the unique look of the bold colors in such a classical foral motif. One thing of note: this is one if you want it to fit right and look right, you are going to need someone elses help. This has just one row of &#34;hook and eyes&#34; at the front, so the only place that it can be personalized to you is the back lacings. And, I am not a contortionist, and don't really know what ties I would have to hook to what doorknob to manage to get this fitted on myself properly. So, you are gonna need help. Like in the days of victorian. Or you could find a youtube video and diy. Whatever floats your boat. This can be worn with or without a top or bra on. Either way, it holds the bust up and out :-) This is made of a gorgeous black based material with &#34;embroidery&#34; of a blue and yellow foral pattern. The boning is not super stiff, but there is more on/ in this corset as others I have. The back of the fabric is a soft cottony like material (says polyester,) and is not thick thick, but not as thin as a cotton t-shirt. The fabric does not stretch, and it is not stiff. Very comfortable, and it looks hot! The lacing is black boot lace type material, and ties at the mid-back. (You can however remove the lacings and lace them up in different ways, there are some neat charts on how to do different lacing patterns out there.) All of the edges are rimmed with black satin like material. The &#34;hook and eyes&#34; (I use quotations because these are unique and industrial looking clasp like things,) are not as noticable on the blue and yellow version, as there is so much color going on that they kind of get lost. I think if you really like the &#34;hook and eyes&#34; go for the black. I think it would display them better. I, however, am totally happy my blue and yelllow (and black.) The eyelets the lacing runs through are standard round silver. Oh, and this does not cover your bust. So you will need to add your own clothes if you want to wear it that way.  I think this will be totally great for the Ren fest next year, I have always wanted to dress up. Now I get to. Photos when camera is fixed."
5.0,The dainty hearts on the anklet are very pretty. The length of the anklet makes it possible to accommodate a large ankle size.
5.0,Running watch.
5.0,It was perfect for someone I adore that is recovering & needs to look & feel beautiful
5.0,I had to make some adjustments to the length and the top part of the dress too wide didn't sit right maybe a small size would of been better for me! but love the fabric and dress looks great!
5.0,I love your girls gowns! Make more styles!
5.0,"This is the cutest nightgown. It's super soft and my 2 year old thinks it is wonderful, as all things with princesses on them are. I would purchase it again if they had it in a different color!"
5.0,Wear them all the time. Comfortable fit as expected. Love the side pockets for my phone ordered medium
5.0,"I‚Äôm 125 lbs and wear a 34B and the medium was a perfect fit! I got it to layer with a deep V bodysuit I had and it works perfect! It is very sheer fabric so if you plan to wear it alone, you would probably want to wear pasties or even another bra under it, there‚Äôs enough room in the cups that I could definitely wear a push-up bra under it. Absolutely love it!"
5.0,"Wear well, fit well, feel good. Woudl like to see these in a mid calf or knee length sock. Also, in a warmer yarn."
5.0,These are exactly what I was looking  very happy with them
5.0,Needed these for a stage production . Very shiny in lights!
5.0,"Even though it was smaller then what my son wears , it still fit snug and he still like it. Definitely go up another size on this from your original size"
5.0,Nice and wide in the toes
5.0,My boyfriend Loved them!
5.0,So very happy!  Have had so many compliments on this band!  It fits perfectly too!
5.0,I'm usually a 4.5 but I feel adidas shoes run big so I ordered a 4 and they got great!
5.0,product perfectly
5.0,I love these shorts. Just used the black to workout the day after I received the package. I love how it fits and looks.
5.0,Hubby loved this tee. Soft and comfy. Nice colors too
5.0,"I've purchased 3 of these so far (me, my Mom, and a close friend). Perfect for what I was looking for"
5.0,I usually wear a 16 or an xl. This dress fits like 90% of my other xl dresses.
5.0,"My favorite hijab out of dozens of hijabs. For someone who has been wearing scarves for quite a while and has tried many different qualities, I highly recommend the scarves from this seller.  The material is great. Not too slippery. It's just right. Sits beautifully on top of the head. Highly recommend it to anyone and everyone."
5.0,"I love this, very pretty."
5.0,This is a awesome bracelet!! I have never been disappointed from anything from China!!! They make the best jewelry.
5.0,these shoes are cute and go with a lot of outfits.
5.0,Daughter loves them!!
5.0,This dress is simple lovely. It is absolutely adorable and fits so well. I have not even one complaint. Great material. Soft. Comfortable.
5.0,"These boots are the perfect fall/ winter shoe! I received the boots in November and I have worn them countless times since then. I love wearing them with leggings, dresses, jeans, you name it! The material is good quality and they fit like a glove. My only complaint is that 2 of the studs have fallen off but it's not a big deal, I was expecting that to happen. I have received countless compliments on these boots and I would recommend them to any stylish woman :) I'm a 17 year old."
5.0,"These hats are soft, and good quality. I like how you can tighten it in the back according to your head size. I have 5 hats from this brand. Very much worth the money."
5.0,"Compared to my previous experience with baby and toddler shoes these are very good quality. We love them and I will definitely buy them again and again as my little boy's foot grows. The soles are soft and cushiony yet very supportive. They also grip the ground very well unlike his last pair of sandals which had him sliding all over the place on some surfaces. I love how the leather cage part of the sandal protects his toes. They are very easy to take on and off. I love that the strap around the ankle is cushioned, it looks very comfortable. I love putting these on my baby, thank you."
5.0,"Love these earrings, especially the screw on backs which prevent losing them!"
5.0,Very nice looking used it as a necklace.
5.0,Soft and cuddly! Gave to my granddaughter for Christmas.
5.0,love it on my watch
5.0,"I was so nervous to buy a dress offline, and my sister really wanted me to wear a lacy dress for her wedding and I stumbled across this dress at the last minute and decided to give it a try. I was not to fond of the belt in the picture as it looked silky and was hoping I could remove it upon arrival. It came in a USPS bag which made me even more nervous, but when I opened the package and seen it was a stretchy material and the belt was nothing like the picture I was in LOVE! I put it on and it was so comfortable and fit perfectly! It was so perfect for her outdoor country wedding and I was so comfortable the whole night!"
5.0,This was a gift for a friend. She loved it. It shows her pride in her Marine son.
5.0,Love these earrings. Well made and pretty. Lovely pink quartz color.
5.0,Beautiful masks! Great quality and come with filters for filter pocket. A lot better than I expected!!
5.0,"This dress was stunning. The quality was way more than I expected it to be. I ordered the dress based on the size guide and it fit almost perfectly. I had to have it hemmed and the upper back had to have ‚Äúdarts‚Äù placed on the sides to keep the ‚Äúv‚Äù flat. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. I searched and searched for another option because, really, who wants to order their wedding dress from Amazon and I always went back to this one. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. I‚Äôm still in awe."
5.0,"I only have positive things to say about the dress.  I usually wear a small in most clothing, and the small size  of this dress fit exactly as it should.  I'm 5' 3"" and the length is almost to the floor, but does not drag, so about any size heel should be okay.  The material is soft, comfortable, and just the right amount of stretch.  The only reason I selected this particular color/print is because it was a special price (about half of the other prices).  However, now that I know the quality of the dress, I would not hesitate to purchase another one at the higher price.  It's really pretty and more of a casual, fun print.  It will be great for any casual outing, such as dinner, shopping, errands, birthday party, outdoor barbecue, etc.  (Note:  My review is only for the print dress where the print is the same on the entire dress - not for the solid colors or for the combination solid and print.  I believe sometimes there can be a difference in size and fabric type)."
5.0,Love this hat.. very comfortable and love the style
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted it for, the stopwatch for racing. Works great so far. I wore it in the shower and it didn‚Äôt bother it."
5.0,Very cute and exactly as described.
5.0,Does run a little small. But overall fits perfectly!
5.0,Made an adorable Mrs Claus hood. Fit fine
5.0,"I bought this dress in 2 colors, black stripes and green stripes. Perfect fit. I wanted something fitted but not tight. I wish there were more color/print options. I'd order so many more!!! Just tired of every nursing dress I find is stripes LOL I ordered the medium and I'm 126lbs, 5'5&#34; and 36C bra."
5.0,"Beatiful!!! I just loveeee it! Although be carefull, I practically took my ear apart when I wanted to take the earring from my ear. It has a very hard grab. It doesnt open and close easily"
5.0,"I searched for sweatbands for a while, and finally chose these. Love them because they're thin & can be pushed up to a 1/2&#34; thickness or pulled out to 1 3/4&#34; wide, has a non slip backing, & stops the sweat from dripping in my eyes. I have really short hair and headbands/sweatbands aren't my thing so I didn't want something big & bulky. I also use them for face maintenance and they are wide enough to keep the baby hairs off my face while I wash. All in all, a verastile product and I am very happy with the purchase. My ONLY drawback would be that taking it on & off can pull a bit when sweaty( a bit like rubbery) if you aren't careful."
5.0,"This is a nice Dress....The Price is Right!<br />An extra Dress for my wardrobe.....However; for me the Bodice, waist up<br />was for a little taller Person and will have to be altered...A very nice dress,<br />To have on hand for any special occasion."
5.0,Perfect for costumes and cosplay. This sit is pretty accurate for size. Easily paintable with acrylics. I use this product every year for Halloween costumes.
5.0,My wife wears hers all the time!
5.0,"It is as beautiful as the picture.  I love that I can fold it anyway I like and form it into shape when ready to wear.  This hat is very versatile, I can wear it with many swimsuits."
5.0,This tutu is absolutely beautiful! I ordered it for my dutch Shepherd for her 4th birthday & I know I will be recording a new color ever single year. She looked so beautiful on her special day! ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,Love the shirt. Love fabric and the fit. Wish it had more colors.
5.0,"these sunglasses are awesome, they look great, fit great and shade well without disturbing my vision"
5.0,"I normally wear a medium, but went up a size to a large. The fit is great and a little roomy. The sweatshirt is not too bulky, which is helpful for packing on a trip."
5.0,"Had surgery and needed compression socks. If you have short legs, they are a bit long, just make sure you ""bunch"" in the right areas or fold down at the top so they aren't uncomfortable."
5.0,I purchased them as a birthday party goody bag gift they are a good size and very good looking toys
5.0,LOVE it and you can't beat the price!!
5.0,It's a little bigger than I anticipated it would be but it's a perfect sun hat! It's also super cool that you can roll it up so it's easy to travel with.
5.0,Great quality - better than expected for the price!
5.0,I love it! Better than expected
5.0,Handbag is great!
5.0,I absolutely love these pants! They are so comfortable and the material feels great and is light weight. I've worn them out of the house as not so much pj's and I've gotten tons of compliments on them! I think I need to order another pair! Fits as expected.
5.0,"My foot doctor recommended this brand to help with my over-pronation and bad knees.  I brought the wrong size, and had to return these sandals.  But once in the correct size, they are glorious.  I put on these shoes, and went from walking a few feet to walking miles."
5.0,"This dress is nicely made and it has pockets!! The material is soft, the Boho pattern and style is really pretty. It does run a little big so I will be returning for a size smaller."
5.0,"Since I can't review the actual product as they were a gift, I can say that my sister-in-law made sure to tell me how much she loved these socks after she wore them. They are very cute and she says they feel great."
5.0,My granddaughter really likes the bag. She is a senior in high school and told me the bag iis great for both school and work. The bag was packed very well and it arrived as promised. Very pleased that my granddaughter liked it.
5.0,"After tons of research I bought a men's small, I'm 5'9 and 120 lbs, being tall and lean means men's pants fit me better than lady's. The fit is almost perfect, yes a little short at ankle, please understand this is to fit around a hiking or winter boot. Material has a stretch/give, perfect for my needs as I ride a bike all day, 20 miles would be normal for me. I have a 24-25 waist and these are roomy enough to layer clothes under for bitter cold winter days. Legs have enough room for my cycling muscle to move with ease, no zipper or button problems for me, and love the belt loops.<br /><br />If you are looking for pants that are quick drying, light and easy to wash/dry, I'd say this will work. Of course I ended ordering a 2nd pair, and will wear them until they fall apart. I can comfortabley  ride my street bike and cruiser with ease and don't feel &#34;swamp effects&#34; with cycling or fast walking.<br /><br />Material doesn't hold orders, so no need to add baking soda or other neutralizers in the wash cycle. Line drys in no time at all, and keeps shape well. Easy to roll and store in small daypack/backpack."
5.0,This ring is perfect for cat lovers. The mood stone adds  to its style.
5.0,I love this new handbag! It is just the right size - Not too big or too small. The mix of neutral colors goes with just about everything. This is my second Mona B purchase. They are very sturdy and will last a long time.
5.0,"Super cute, I got lots of compliments."
5.0,"Good fit, comfortable."
5.0,The pendant is just what I was looking for! I wear it must if the time
5.0,"This is one of the great albums. Delaney and Bonnie were on a roll at this point, and this album introduced the &#34;unplugged&#34; concept. Plus of course you get Clapton, Duane Allman, et al. Rock history.."
5.0,Bought 2 in the spring- a size larger. I wear a 12 in jeans. Got an XL - cups were a little big but tied tight enough you really could tell. Honestly - love the suits. Full coverage - material was good quality - pink is a little faded from the sun - royal blue hasn‚Äôt faded  Def ordering another 2 - can‚Äôt go wrong for the price !!!
5.0,I just received my nikes today and they are so adorable. I wear a 7 and the reviews sad go up a half a size. But I still ordered a 7 when I put them on I was so happy they fit perfectly. I've already got compliments on them. Love them...
5.0,I love this bag!  Very nice!
5.0,They are great and just what I needed
5.0,It nice the bow tie is not choking me so it's great
5.0,I love this kit. The polish makes the metals look new and the solution really makes your gems shine.
5.0,LOVE
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, my daughter loved it! However, the cups are on the small side."
5.0,Great fit and helps smooth out the back strap area. The length of the fabric panel below the cups hold the ribcage and smooths you out. The shoulder straps stay in place. Ordered a second one after receiving the first.
5.0,Well done and attractive.  A good match for the upcoming season to accent a sweater.<br />Very pleased
5.0,Very cute little pineapples!
5.0,Beautifully done. Nice gift.
5.0,"I bought the XL according to reviews since I typically am a med/large shirt shopper. Fits well for leggings or jeans and is a little long, which is how I dig this sort of item since I'm all about below-booty length. Shipping was super fast, and although the quality wasn't stellar, it was as I expected for the price point. Looked just like the photos."
5.0,I ordered the dark gray sweatshirt in a large. I am a 34 DD and 5‚Äô4‚Äù. It‚Äôs a flattering cute on my frame. The dark gray looks very similar to the online picture. It‚Äôs a boxy cut. The cuffs and the bottom both have ribbing about 2‚Äù thick. It‚Äôs 30% cotton so it‚Äôs someone breathable.
5.0,"Great gloves, got them for my son in law for Christmas.  He picked them out on line and was a little concerned about the quality.  As we all know, you can't feel and see the quality of items like this on line.  They were GREAT QUALITY and he is very pleased."
5.0,It was a nice hoodie but to small
5.0,Excellent price. Loved this!
5.0,üòç love it!
5.0,"These fit great. When I opened them, I thought they looked too small for a L but once I tried them I realized that the size is perfect. The color is beautiful. The material seems a little cheap but for the price, it's worth getting it."
5.0,"I order a size large. I'm 5' 4&#34; tall, weight 130 pounds, my measurements are 36&#34; 29&#34; 39&#34;. I usually wear size 6. I will suggest to take your measurements, check what size that fit your measurements (may not be your regular size) and get the next size bigger. Following my measurements i would have gotten a medium, a medium would have been a little tight everywhere. If you are buying this is because you like the top, buy a size for your chest, you can always use a different bottom piece."
5.0,Niftalicious!!!
5.0,My granddaughter loves these shoes.  Who has time to tie shoes on a busy school day?  Looks cute with school uniform.
5.0,So many to choose from and all are of great quality. Not cheap looking at all. Thanks.
5.0,Bought for my wife she wears them around house since she doesn't like slippers but has cold feet. Will be buying more for her
5.0,I bought these for my sons & he absolutely loves them üòä
5.0,"My son purchased one of these necklaces for a pendant he had given to his girlfriend and she liked it so much he purchased a second one for another pendant he had given her.  The necklace was sturdy yet delicate and reflects light beautifully and exactly as promised.  Very nice and we would definitely recommend to anyone looking for Sterling Silver necklace, various lengths available."
5.0,"Like the sentiment, sweet!  This is well made set..soft tight knit but still able to stretch.  The hat is capable of folding upward if wanted.  Good sized for warmth + not super bulky.  The colors are bright and stay if you wash cold, gentle.  Would make a great gift too"
5.0,"Honestly it's perfect for what I needed it for. My son loved it. It's not super warm, so isn't meant for really cold weather, unless you are using it in layers. Great for a fall or early spring day."
5.0,I am impressed with company. Pearls arrived earlier than predicted and looked great. Nice box and packaging.
5.0,beautiful cut and great color. just that it's too long and I had to cut the bottom.
5.0,Just what I needed . Good bounce to fabric . Not too thick . Not too thin. Professional but hip.
5.0,"Its cute. I love it an I get a lot of compliments on it. got here fast, worth it would buy again."
5.0,The most comfy bra I own! Will order again
5.0,"I love these socks. They fit perfectly and they work well for my feet.  I'm paralyzed and tend to get some edema after a long day in my chair.  These are great for that.  Really, I got these for when I have to fly because I am hoping they will help my legs feel better.  I am pretty sure they will as they work so well in every other way."
5.0,"Finally, all cotton socks. Don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôll hold up versus polyester, but the wonders of real cotton make it worthwhile regardless."
5.0,Nice and the glasses frame material is durable
5.0,Cute hat really like it. Fast shipping
5.0,Exactly what he wanted and a perfect fit.
5.0,Well made and Comfortable.  Keeps my neck nice & warm.

5.0,"So, I worked at Trader Joe‚Äôs and wanted Hawaiian buttonups instead of regular shirts this by far was my FAVORITE!!! Everyone loved my shirt as did I! Definitely recommend"
5.0,"Truly nice, fits perfectly and very good material for the price. Looks just like the picture. Happy with it !"
5.0,"This runs large, but keeps your ojenadores toasty for those cold air conditioned offices"
5.0,This purse is gorgeous. It looks exactly like it does in the picture I got the matching wallet this purse exceeds all of my other purses if you purchase this purse you will not be dissapointed
5.0,Love this brand!  It's light cool and well made.
5.0,So shiny and sparkly
5.0,These are really working out well.  I use them for kayaking and they keep my feet warm and dry.  Good purchase.
5.0,"After reading all the reviews I wasn't sure if I should go a size larger or go with my normal size also with the neck being tight as a concern as stated in a lot of reviews. I decided to go with my normal size and I got an extra large, it fit exactly as expected and as far as the neck it is not too tight in fact I think it's perfect. I live in Wisconsin and I just spent about 20 minutes outside wearing nothing but this hoodie and a undershirt and did not get cold at all keep in mind it's 19 degrees outside. Overall this is a very quality product would recommend to anyone, very fast shipping will definitely buy again. Also I wanted to add the tag does state that it's pre-shrunk although I have not washed mine yet."
5.0,"These fit perfectly, and feel amazing. They seem to be high quality, and have survived the first few washes so far. These are not Under Armor replacements, which is what I expected, but they do a great job as workout shirts, or a base layer for hot weather activities. Definitely recommended. They fit exactly like a form-fitting medium should."
5.0,Got as a gift for my cousin and she loves it
5.0,"LOVE this top- So much so that I bought it in 3 colors. Very flattering and versatile- Can wear with jeans or dress pants. It's got a good amount of stretch. I wash it in cold water and hang it to dry.. No wrinkles. The blue is a beautiful color, BTW; much prettier than it looks online!"
5.0,Love it!!!üëçüèºüëçüèº
5.0,Really cute earrings! A good purchase!
5.0,"So beautiful and nicely made. These beads serve purpose and calm my anxiety. If they were to ever break, I hope to buy them again. Extremely happy."
5.0,I used these beautiful charms as ornaments on a nutcracker themed mini Christmas tree. In also adorned the tree skirt with them. Very beautiful. Very good quality.
5.0,"These socks are warm and stay in place. If you like a tight, but comfortable sock, this is the one."
5.0,I love the bright colors and light compression. It helps with the pain in my lower legs. My doctor was impressed with the ease of applying. I want to order more. Thanks
5.0,Fit my 9 year old daughter perfectly
5.0,These earrings are great quality
5.0,Nice product great quality
5.0,Granddaughter loved them...:-)
5.0,"When I received my order I was surprised to find it came in a nice black gift box. I really like this necklace, its simple enough to wear every day but you can easily dress it up for an evening out as well. The colors are really nice and go with most everything I own. I love the geometric design and the hand tooled look of the gold setting and the dainty gold chain goes well with the chunky pendant. It has a nice weight to it and is definitely sturdy enough for everyday wear.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for a fair and unbiased review."
5.0,Very nice. Good quality. Exactly what I needed for my wedding. Arrived in execelent packaging and on time.
5.0,Esta ermoso
5.0,"I wish the gold color was less fake. Other than that I love it. It has bling, and works in the pool as well. I have had tons of compliments on it."
5.0,Way better in person!!! Comfortable!!!
5.0,"This slipper is so warm, Fits as expected. Down side. it took forever for shipping, almost 2 weeks"
5.0,these are cute and durable
5.0,This is a double sided necklace. The chain is very nice as well. It came with a velvet gift pouch and a small polishing cloth.
5.0,"I'm an apple shape & size 18 and have a really hard time finding leggings or tights that fit comfortably, and don't dig in as well. I also have sensory issues with rough/itchy/stiff materials so that makes it even more difficult to shop. I LOVE THESE JOGGERS. they feel like leggings but fit like joggers, the waistband is wide and sturdy, and really holds the pants up (even with my s22 ultra in the pocket - literally unheard of with such a heavy phone) but it is so soft and isn't digging into my rib cage at all. They do sadly have a middle front seam - but this is my only issue with them. I will be ordering more pairs to have on hand. I also want to mention that depending on your work dress code, these are not quite as form fitting as leggings and since they are not ""sweatpant"" material like most joggers, I can wear them to work with a nice shirt and cardigan and nobody would question if they were slacks or not, which is what I bought them for so I'm glad they worked out!"
5.0,This was a gift and was well received since it is a lovely bag that looks more expensive and is a versatile style.
5.0,This looks pretty awesome. I just attached it to the other chain I already had on and it's sturdy but not crazy heavy. I'd definitely notice if my wallet was dangling or if someone tried to grab it.
5.0,"These pants are beyond comfortable! I am 5 ft 9 and I can wear these with confidence, knowing they are not too short & not too tight. They are the perfect beach pant! Pair this with a bodysuit & you're good to go."
5.0,"Great quality, exactly what I was expecting."
5.0,"This anklet is really cute, I am very happy with it!"
5.0,works so well
5.0,Got exactly what I was expecting. The description is spot on.
5.0,"These bags make much more sense than hoarding and using the bags you buy at grocery stores now.  My car was getting to be a nightmare of bag stashing.  This is so much more organized.  They are pretty, lightweight and hold a lot.  Best part is I actually remember to take them into the store with me."
5.0,My sister is ill.  I added her to my prayer chain and gave this cross to her..  It is a perfect gift for her.  She wears it everyday..
5.0,Bought an x small. Beautifull fit! I am 4'7 100 pounds 36 b. Everything  fit just right!! Going to buy in black! In loveüòç

5.0,"I love this wallet ,perfect  size!!!!"
5.0,"Super cute, colors aren‚Äôt bright which is exactly what I wanted! Super cute and a good price"
5.0,I've had this watch about 7 months and have surfed with it almost every day. No issues. Works like new. What a deal!!!
5.0,"This dress is cute. When it was delivered my little daughter was very excited. Too bad it is cold outside, she was upset that she couldn‚Äôt wear it to school. The dress fits perfect, as expected. The material is also good quality. Very colorful, cute, and adorable."
5.0,This is a gorgeous dress and fits true to size üíï<br />It is long on me but everything is.
5.0,"Great selection, came early.  Very happy with purchase"
5.0,"My order was screwed up and I received some ridiculous eye gel instead of my socks. Upon hearing this, the seller apologized (even though, it was not their fault) they apologized and sent me replacements free of charge! I received them and they feel great! I recommend these for anyone!"
5.0,The shirt fits great and looks even better. I get many compliments when I wear it. Highly recommend!
5.0,Cute addition to my floating charm necklace!!
5.0,Super beautiful
5.0,This is too cute. The material is soft.  It is going to be a present for my new to be born niece. I love the saying.
5.0,Beautiful. these are my favorite earrings. I receive compliments all the time.
5.0,"This ring is just gorgeous & for the price who wouldn't want it! It took forever to get here but what do you except coming from China, right?<br />This is ring is beautiful & goes w any outfit. It's really thin which surprised me, but it's still beautiful none the less."
5.0,"I love this blouse.  I am 5'6 125 lbs and bought the Medium..i think small might have fit a little better, but the Medium is fine.  Fits nice and seems to be good quality.  But seems to run slightly big."
5.0,The original band i had broke after constant use. This replaces the oringinal perfectly
5.0,"A little small, but still a nice hat!"
5.0,These are the perfect thickness and keep my head and ears warm. They were inexpensive and came 4 to a pack.
5.0,Very cute. It‚Äôs good material. I ended up buying a second one.

5.0,One of my favorite cardigans!!!  I ordered one size up - and it fits perfect!  Super comfy - going to get more of them!
5.0,I sent this to my sister and she was blown away by the quality and value. Can‚Äôt go wrong!
5.0,I love this shirt! I bought it for myself. I bought a men‚Äôs large. It fits me as a dress and I wear a belt around it.
5.0,"So beautiful! It was expected to arrive Jan. 15th, but it arrived before Christmas! It is delicate, but we are happy with the purchase and it held up well in packaging."
5.0,Pretty for girls
5.0,So dainty and pretty. Love the great deal on it!
5.0,"I love this chain, i took 3 links out of it to make it even shorter to show off the blue cross pendant i have on it."
5.0,Exactly as described. Perfect for the project I'm working with. üòä
5.0,I love this top! It is so soft and fit perfectly. It isn't as long as I thought but I love it. It is tee length not tunic length.
5.0,"With a 14E shoe size I am constantly disappointed in what some manufacturers call size 13+. No disappointment here! These socks are great, great fit, great support, and great comfort. I ordered my first pack 3 months ago and they have passed every test I have put them through so I have now order another pack. These are now my &#34;go-to&#34; socks of choice."
5.0,"Adorable absolutely love it, great fit."
5.0,"Everything on this piece was perfectly done, my wife absolutely loves it!"
5.0,I wasn't sure about the llama print but I love it! The wallet has lots of space and I have gotten multiple compliments on it.

5.0,"So, I'm a man. And this fits me wonderfully. I love wearing it honestly."
5.0,"I bought this watch a couple years ago now, and I love it. I own a dozen or so watches and this is the one that always gets the compliments. It is very light weight and easy to wear. I read a review saying it is difficult or impossible to change the battery. That is not true, my battery just recently died, and I changed it myself. I would buy this watch again!"
5.0,True to other reviews this jacket does run small. My son who just turned 8 usually wears a 7-8. Glad I ordered the 8/10. He absolutely loves this coat!!!! The hood with the full face zipper is priceless. I would highly recommend.
5.0,"Well made , but might want 2 get better backs"

5.0,My lovely girlfriend has cats so regular flowers are out. So instead of getting her flowers which would have just been eaten to celebrate us moving to the next stage of our relationship I bought her this lovely piece. Purple being her favorite color and she loved it!<br /><br />The quality is excellent and the color was vibrant with the gold highlighting. Came in a really nice box as well. Very pleased with this product overall and guys it makes a great gift!
5.0,"Like the material, fit and how they wear the whole day!"

5.0,"Love it, super soft material"
5.0,Such a cute bracelet. Bought it for my daughter for her sweet 16. She loves it.

5.0,"Great boots for the price, fit well and have held up :) Glad I bought them!"
5.0,Works for what they are needed for
5.0,"This is a great idea. However, it was much smaller than I thought it would be. Beach ball size. However, it does work great for holding extra stuffed animals or even old clothes. We used it for stuffed animals and it is in my daughter's tent. Would buy again, but bigger size."
5.0,These are shorter and do have have a long tail to catch on things.  Keeps glasses handy.

5.0,I loved this product especially for the price.
5.0,Really nice shawl.  Size is great..so is feel of the fabric.  Looked great with my dress.
5.0,Love this shirt - casual enough for jeans and the lace accents on the arms make it dressy enough for work attire.
5.0,"I'm in LOVE with the shirt. I bought a large at Marshall's and fell in love with it. yes it does shrink in the wash and the fabric Rayon is soft and is kind of sheer, but if properly cared for there should not be a problem. ( cared for as in, Do NOT put in the dryer, treat rayon clothing like a sweater and lay flat to dry or hang but without clothes pins). I am very upset that there is no large available for sale because I was going to get another one."
5.0,Great Value for a solid winter boot
5.0,"I love the look and quality of these shoes, and  the classic D'Orsay styling is ultra feminine. They look equally good with satin pants or an evening dress or skirt. Very flattering on the foot."
5.0,"Love this shirt. Looks exactly like the picture. Fabric is typical t shirt material. I love the design. I'll order again. True to size. I'm 221, 5'10.5 and I order the shirt xl."

5.0,Fast delivery
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to put on my smart watch. It's well made.
5.0,"This is a fine puffy type coat that suits our Colorado climate right on.  My wife is 5' 6' 125# and it fits her a bit tight in the chest.  My 5' 8""  teenage daughter who is 117# and not chesty as my wife, it fits pretty well, perhaps a little short in the sleeve length, but not much.<br /><br />They both love it regardless of slight size differences.  It definitely keeps them warm and looks nice.  Easy wipe clean material and cold wash if needed."
5.0,"I love it, definitely I look great and is super comfortable"
5.0,"Awesome undershirts for workout or daily wear under my dress shirts.<br /><br />I‚Äôm an XL in almost all of my shirts, and per the advice of the reviews I purchased one size down as a L, and I‚Äôm glad I did.<br /><br />If you order a size down they seem to have good compression and slimming properties but are still comfortable to leave on all day.<br /><br />Will be ordering a bunch more!"
5.0,"I installed the 60 gallon tank for a 2017 Ford F350. S&B includes extra features like the fuel station and sump ports. I also really like the front strap which is not just a strap. It is actually a skid plate that matches the OEM skid plate exactly. The entire tank hangs down only 1 inch more than OEM which is very important for anyone going off road. I was able to install it by myself in what would have been less than 3 hours if it wasn't for the extra time to record the steps. You can google ""one man install S&B tank"" and find that video.  I've been using it for 3 months and have filled it a few times. The truck will show zero fuel left when there are only 4 gallons left so I take that fuel warning seriously. One of the best features is the simple fact that a person can fill up when they want to rather than when they have to. 60 gallons will go a long way whether towing or not.<br /><br />The installation itself is well documented by S&B. They provide a QR code in the box which links to the very latest installation instructions. This is much better than using a printed document because S&B can update it so easily. I used only hand tools and motorcycle straps to remove and lower the OEM tank and then lift the massive 60 gallon tank into place. The electrical and fuel hose connectors are all standard and really easy to use. They might be a bit stiff to remove the first time but they reconnect easily with zero leaks. The sending unit uses the OEM hold-down ring which is much better than the metal plate method. There's no need to torque down nuts carefully over a 20 minute period and it protects much better from water getting past the o-ring and into the tank.<br /><br />I'm really glad S&B got into the fuel tank business. This tank is a very high quality product. The long-established companies are going to have to step up their game."
5.0,Love this shirt!  Soft and very comfortable.
5.0,"5‚Äô4‚Äù, 140lbs I ordered a size medium. I like the feel and fit. The string in the back is a bit of a hassle but other than that it‚Äôs great."
5.0,Great quality patch!! Love it
5.0,I had no idea what size to order based on other reviews. Normally I buy a medium for a looser fit but followed the company‚Äôs size chart & ordered an XL.  For reference I‚Äôm 110lbs 36C chest & prefer a looser fit.  It is pretty big around the arm holes but it flows nicely & works fine with a sports bra.  I probably could have done a large. However This was perfect for tie dying! Just order based on the given size chart
5.0,They're very comfortable and work great to support my arch.
5.0,"This item looks exactly as pictured.  It's soft, felt band if perfect for a baby or small child's head and the wide bands to tie it helped keep it on my child's head.  He looked super cute at his wild things party!"
5.0,AAAAAAA++++++++
5.0,Use on the go for mood regulation my daughter likes them.
5.0,They are so comfortable that I can wear them all day and I get so many compliments on them!
5.0,well made looks great
5.0,Love these bands. Like the bright colors and worth the price. I like to switch my bands out a lot.
5.0,This shirt is comfortable. Perfect for low 60s and High 50s with a windshirt.
5.0,"Perfect for travel - if you don't wear  large jewelry.  I put four necklaces in the top, 3 pairs of post earrings on the divider, 8 pairs of earrings in the bottom compartments, 2 more pair in the slots, along with 2 rings.  There was still room for a lot more.  The best part is, when it's zipped shut, all of the pieces stay in place.  The necklaces did not tangle, and the earrings stayed exactly where I put them.  The 'silvery' color is more champagne than silver, but still very nice.  Love it !  I will be giving these for Christmas gifts."
5.0,"LOVE this hat. It goes with beach wear, tiki, pinup, traveling... You can fold up it up in your suitcase, pull it out, put it back into shape. The stitched flower design is very Hawaiian, tropical. It's just a lovely hat. It's a little large, IMO, but that isn't going to prevent me from wearing it on my tropical vacation."
5.0,Perfect for a casual summer dress! I even bought it in another color.
5.0,"Just received the beret and it was everything I wanted it to be. Warm, soft and elastic trim. Loved it so much, I ordered 2 more with different colors. Wish more colors become available in the future. Will be keeping an eye as long as the quality is the same."
5.0,We got these right before our Disney trip and my kids LOVED them!!  Great for trading at Disney!!  Will buy from this seller again!
5.0,It looks just like the way it is presented on here. You won't‚Äã be disappointed.
5.0,"The material is very soft and comfortable.  Nice and stretchy, easy on and off. True to size and fit. Very comfortable."
5.0,As expected. Nice bag my daughter loves it. Already tested the waterproof and it actually is.
5.0,"I honestly didn't expect the dress to be so nice! This dress was more expensive than another similar one that I ordered, but the quality was better.  I ordered thisn for a bridesmaid gown but the bride chose a different look. I still wanted to share because it really is pretty! I needed a modest gown and I thought this one would work well with the right shell underneath, or you can easily build in sleeves. The top part is a little<br />sheer with support cups for the chest.  It is not so noticeable, but I would wear a shell or line it. The neckline wasn't soo low, there was a part covering the v area so you don't see cleavage.  Also not entirely necessary but I would recommend wearing a light petticoat under if you want a little more oomph.  I also really liked how there was a little train in the back.  I imagine this dress coming out so pretty in pictures. Wish I could have worn it.  I felt fairy princess like trying it on üòÜ"
5.0,Best old sox logo
5.0,Bought for my husband. He liked it.
5.0,I l‚ù§ve it i get many complements on it

5.0,"Bought it for scout camp, it's light and easy to pack."
5.0,Beautiful  Bag  worth the price looks like a high priced handbag got it in 3 colors yes I recommend this handbag looks just like one I paid $348 for
5.0,"This is a cute & fun dress for holiday parties and every other occasion you want to feel and look a bit festive without getting entangled in an ugly sweater. This dress is thin and stretchy, so be prepared to wear something underneath when it's colder. I like the pattern and the soft feel, it just could be a little less tight around my chest, but that is a common big-boob problem.<br />Recommend!"
5.0,"I like it , it is warm and with pockets, the only con is it is thick and you can't were coat with it, it is for Aotumn, not for winter"
5.0,Exactly as advertised and prefect fit!
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when the package arrived.  The package stated Extra Large for the size, but some reviews said it would be ok for a large child.  I am 6'2"" and just over 200#'s and the costume fit like a glove.  As others commented, the mask is folded in the package and the crease is difficult to work with.  I blew up a 12"" balloon in the mask and used a hair dryer on it a few times.  I left the balloon in the mask for a few days and the crease is minor and hardly noticeable.  Now to find a pair of tux pants to go with the jacket..."
5.0,Sleeves are a bit long but fits to size
5.0,it would be better to have bright colorful tropical fish designs
5.0,Read the reviews before I ordered and ordered 1 size larger. Fits perfectly. Love this leo!
5.0,My grandson loved everything especially the wand!
5.0,Nice shirt - good color combo and nice display of winning roster names!
5.0,Arrived early. Beautiful
5.0,He looks so cute w the chain it‚Äôs not heavy for him.  Doesn‚Äôt bother him at all and I love it.
5.0,These are the softest and most comfortable pjs I ever wore! Only wish the shorts had pockets. I would definitely buy again.
5.0,Best compression sock dver and i tried at least 10 different brands.
5.0,Shirt looks like it is of good quality and it is silky smooth.
5.0,I am very pleased with this product. I use these bottles to mix my oils in to make my own air freshener.
5.0,I love the product and wish they had more products like this one
5.0,Awesome very good fits to my sisters liking I think it should be larger definitely will buy again if she wants another later
5.0,I love this bathing suit and it looks wonderful with the skirt! My favorite color is the red with white dots but you can also get it in other colors!!
5.0,"I use this for hiking and walking around the beach and park. Good quality material and the stitches are in all the right places and not unraveling. My head size is a 22, but I can still fit my finger in between my head and the brim easily. At least it is not squeezing my head and giving me a headache! Even if your head size is smaller this would still work. All you need to do is use a scarf or a string and just tie the top part closed around your head for a tighter fit.<br />I got this mainly because it had the neck and face cover. These are attached with metal hooks through the loops in the hat. I would have preferred Velcro for the ease of putting it on and off, but these seem to work well. Just need some patience while trying to get them in the little loop holes! I would buy it again if I needed another one. It's a good buy!"
5.0,I get tons of compliments on this kimono shirt. Only wish my other ones tied in front to stay closed like this one does. It‚Äôs so cute and comfortable!
5.0,Very cool and comfortable. I ordered a large they fit well
5.0,"I LOVE this cape! My son has had it since he was 2 1/2, and he wears it constantly. It's the perfect size/fit with room to grow, it hangs beautifully, flaps when he runs, and it looks great. I even traced it to make similar capes out of felt for all of the kids at his Superman-themed birthday party. If i had more money, i would've bought the real thing for everyone (but at least i know my son's will be the coolest. =-)"
5.0,"I ordered these eyeglass cases for my husband who is a landscaper. He needs his glasses to see up close while on the job. They keep his glasses safely and conveniently in his shirt pocket. The Velcro closure is secure, as is the clip that holds the case in his pocket. Also, they are priced so that he can change them when they get dirt in them while on a landscaping job. I highly recommend these eyeglass cases for the quality as well as the price."
5.0,"Fits a little small but held up for the entire summer, ended up ordering one for each child and one for next year!!!"
5.0,Nice dress and material. I will order from this seller again
5.0,These brass geometric mandala earrings are just beautiful! They are well made and have been a great addition to my jewelry collection. They do have a little weight to them but I found them to be comfortable and didn‚Äôt weigh down my ears as I had expected. Five stars!
5.0,It's a beautiful necklace. Great value.
5.0,"This bag is great. The padded should strap, which is also adjustable, is awesome. This bag is sturdy and durable. The inside mesh pockets are perfect! I work in a prison and am required to have a see through bag. This is fantastic!!!!"
5.0,"I use it when i work out. Fits perfect. Great quality, breathable and durability. Very comfortable."
5.0,Good price for good quality
5.0,Nice quality! This is for a gift so I haven't tried them but they feel very soft and comfy.
5.0,The dresses were well made and comfortable.  Exactly what we were looking for!
5.0,"I wore this to a &#34;Grace Kelly Tea&#34; where I live and i received many compliments ! Perfect size, elegant and &#34; fascinating &#34;"
5.0,"This is my favorite shirt. After almost a year it is starting to pill a bit, but if there were better (more jewel tone) color choices, I would still buy more of them."
5.0,"It's not the sturdiest built thing so you can't throw it on the ground, but its survived many a toss onto carpets and couches. My 7 and 12 year old love it and have a lot of fun with it. (I do too, hehe!)"
5.0,Loved it. So sweet. If you have small wrists it won‚Äôt stay on
5.0,"This is the cutest swimsuit that I have seen in a long time!!!  It is made extremely well.  The material is a nice weight and, the way it is made, it is a double thickness.<br /><br />I got this several weeks ago.  The top part fits wonderful but the bottom part is much too large.  I was confused when ordering due to several reviews that said to order several sizes up.  It appears that the sizes have been adjusted on Amazon, so I would recommend ordering your true size.  I ordered the US size 12 - 14 and I should have ordered the US size 10 - 12.  My husband said it looked like a family had moved out of the back-side.<br /><br />I am 5' 5&#34; and 160 lbs.  I do wear a size 10 pants but I am not particularly chesty.<br /><br />When i got this it came in a real cute zipper pouch that would be perfect for toting a wet suit home.  The colors are vibrant and beautiful.  Once again, the material is a very nice thickness and is quite stretchy.  I machine washed (on the hand wash cycle) with cold water and hung to dry.  It came out perfect.<br /><br />I love this so much that I have decided to keep it and I am going to crop the bottom of it off and use it as a top with black bottoms.  I can also put some shorts on top of them and wear them that way.  Who knows, maybe I will gain weight and will be able to appreciate the extra room in the bottom.<br /><br />Big bottomed girls....this is the suit for you!  I have looked at other reviews with those that have posted them actually wearing the suit.  It does seem flattering to everybody.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  All these thoughts are my own and were not influenced by the price or discount in any way.  If you found this review helpful please click yes below.  Thank  you!"
5.0,"Soft comfortable leather you can wear all day, every day.  I really like the look, in fact I liked it so much I got one for my husbands Apple Watch as well."
5.0,If you are looking for a tiny post this is it!!!!<br /><br />It is smaller than the typical 1/4‚Äù which was still too long for my rook piercing and the smallest I could find ANYWHERE. I wanted the balls to fit snugly. My prayers have been answered.<br /><br />Getting them screwed on was a pain (always is) but I‚Äôll never take it out!!!
5.0,Love these.Keep a pair in each car
5.0,Can wear these titanium earrings all day with no irritation! Hard to find trendy earrings that sensitive ears can tolerate. These are them. High quality packaging as well.
5.0,Love the top very comfy and cute!!
5.0,"Fits as expected, wife loves it"
5.0,I am a nursing student and these socks are extremely helpful during clinicals. These help keep foot and leg pain at bay and promote comfort all day. I highly recommend these to anyone who has to stand for long hours.
5.0,perfect! just as I wanted
5.0,"They‚Äôre small & petite, goes with everything, loved them!"
5.0,"This chain looks absolutely adorable. Also, the seller shipped it amazingly fast. It was beautifully giftboxed. I will definitely buy from Gem Avenue again."
5.0,"Material is thick enough to be modest, but not so much that it feels restrictive or uncomfortable. Long enough to be professional, and flattering. (I‚Äôm very much an hourglass shape.) Pleased. Worth the price that was paid."
5.0,I like these socks. I bought them on a lightning deal a while back hoping they would be okay. I wish I bought more because they breathe really well.
5.0,So far so good!  Durable and stretchy just like I wanted!
5.0,"Very cute dress. 5'3&#34; 160 lbs, ordered a medium and it fits perfectly."
5.0,Perfectüòâ
5.0,I like smaller piercings and I used these for my septum. They were perfect. If you need to hide them for work or something you need to open them a bit.
5.0,Top notch! Can't go wrong.  I have owned these for a few months and still going strong.  Nothing stops the Fitbit Charger.
5.0,Everyone loved these! Super cure good quality not too heavy just perfect.
5.0,Berry well made and good size
5.0,"No matter what kind the crystal is it, the rosary is beautiful and healed myself just holding it. However, I finally found a product that was not made in China, but Italy. For this point, it's worthy."
5.0,These earrings are beautiful. I love how they lay on the earlobe. So dainty and lovely.
5.0,"Finally arrived, just as advertised"
5.0,"I downsized on the size of the dress, and it is still a little large. Other than that, it is beautiful! Beyond perfect!!"
5.0,This item was exactly as described and was received on time. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in it.
5.0,"The fit was perfect.  The slipper is comfortable, easy to get on and off, and looks good."
5.0,"Super soft and cozy jammies. I am so happy I bought this 2 pack. They are a terrific bargain. I am not wearing them to be sexy, so I don't care about printed bunnies and chicks. If I was looking for sexy nightwear, It wouldn't be from Amazon lol."
5.0,"The earrings are really nice,, they are exactly what I ordered!"
5.0,A lot of people said this had a weird smell...I did not notice any smell at all. Make sure to buy the one that is slightly more expensive (29.99) to get the true vender.  I have had no major problems with this purse so far. Some strings have come loose but nothing has tipped out so far and I am very happy with it.  Id love to purchase another in a different volor!
5.0,"I really loved the colors of these joymade umbrellas!! I bought the baby blue one last time, I‚Äôm looking to get my next one in a pink!!"

5.0,My son loved it. He wore it for his graduation
5.0,These hats are wonderful. My 2 and 4 year old love them. They are cuter than the picture and the perfect size. They shipped fast and we're in great condition when they arrived.
5.0,"Just what I expected and wanted. I have worn this type of watch for years. Eventually the bracket that holds the band breaks, but not for a long time. It keeps time accuratly"
5.0,It‚Äôs very comfortable I actually could have ordered a large.
5.0,In love with these socks
5.0,"Beautiful dress, my daughter wore it to see her first ballet! Fit her perfectly. She just turned 5 this week"
5.0,"The color on this dress is so rich and beautiful!!  Usually I would find the zipper in front strange, but I am breastfeeding my son at this point in life, so it is great!  That means that I now have a beautiful dress I can wear and take care of baby easily.  The fit on the dress is great, I am 5'10&#34; and about 145 in weight."
5.0,Not cheap or flimsy... a solid play show that can be walked in comfortably
5.0,"I have ordered so many of these dresses: they are great quality and fit as you would expect the size to fit and look like the picture. My 21-year-old daughter and her friends LOVE them! And the color range is nothing short of astonishing. Love it, love it!"
5.0,"Bag looked great, smaller than i expected and the zipper broke with in 10 days or normal use."
5.0,"Used it for my granddaughters baptism and it was perfect.  I'm 5'4"" and weigh 135 and a medium fits me very comfortably."
5.0,all good!
5.0,My daughter is in love with this bag!
5.0,I really like this dress. I also got one in black. I wear them all the time. Very true to fit.
5.0,Love love love my bracelet..would definitely buy again for gift!! It is dainty and perfect for any occasion!!
5.0,Loved the fit and style
5.0,"I bought XL, usually it would have been  L. But after reading reviews I decided to go one so  up. I have no regrets.<br />I am 5'8&#34;, 152 pounds a lift!e bigger hips and tighs than bust.  I look great. Thick material, does not look cheap and very nice colors."
5.0,Love these uggs! They are so cute. Very comfortable. Love the little rhinestones.
5.0,"I really love this 3 piece combo. Unfortunately, due to a huge stupid move on my part, I ruined the bag and had to throw it out. I went to order another set and it is not available. Crying here üò™"
5.0,"I was looking for a different band than the original. I bought this leather band and a lavender one from another seller.  This learher band is much better by far.  Now I want another in black. The band is comfortable, easy to put on and looks fantastic!"
5.0,Very detailed little charm that will go well with her collection.  A welcome addition to the charm bracelet.  Wish there were more motorcycle-themed charms like this one!
5.0,I like the quality.
5.0,Gift for my husband. Glasses never fit his big dome. These were winners and came in an impressive case.
5.0,I loved this dress so much that I have it in 3 different colors....it is extremely flattering amd I wear with heels. It's a great dress.
5.0,"So cute my daughter looked amazing in it, true description"
5.0,"This dress is so comfortable. The fabric is very nice and soft. I always get compliments. It fits great and is not see through. Best of all, pockets!"
5.0,Well made! Perfect for my Gatsby themed party! Sequence shed a little but that's to be expected.
5.0,Just perfect. Exactly what my niece wanted.
5.0,"Finally, a workout top that is flattering snd comfortable!"
5.0,Ise it all the time while sewing!  Holds material where I want it and need it to be!
5.0,"She loves it but it's too hot to wear during summer nights.  While our home has air conditioning, the fabric gets too hot for her to wear at night.  We'll just use it as a dress up dress."
5.0,I have not worn this yet but I did try it on and wash it and it is awesome so far! It is made from a quality fabric and is not cheap looking at all! I am 5‚Äô3 125lbs with a 34B busy and it could not fit me more perfectly. I was hesitant because of the price but it has really superseded my expectations thus far.
5.0,Very comfortable. Fit is great. I have RA and my feet swell so this shoe fit the bill.
5.0,"Graduation gift for my two granddaughters, off to college! They loved having encouragement on their keys!"
5.0,"Love these!! The color is what sold me, but once they arrived there was more to love.  The earrings look expensive and solid but are extremely light weight. They are also the perfect size to be seen through curly hair and to not over power your face with your hair up.  Its win all around!!<br /><br />Also when you recieve them, go ahead and shake them out to fluff and release loose strings.<br /><br />Hope this helps"
5.0,Bueno para un regalo
5.0,"Accurate description, swift delivery, and trustworthy transaction."
5.0,Really nice quality product. Recommended!
5.0,"It's very pretty & well made. I'm very pleased with the quality. It has enough pockets for credit cards, an easy access for your ID, an outside zippered pocket for your change & plenty of room inside. It will give me peace of mind when traveling to know that I won't have my information stolen."
5.0,"I loved this dress, it fits very well."
5.0,It‚Äôs a perfect light covering to cover upper arms.
5.0,Adjustable band is great for small wrists!
5.0,"I have a difficult time buying sunglasses as I never have a clue as to what style of frame will fit/suit my face. I rolled the dice buying online and found ""my pair"". (They suit my husband, too, and we normally wear totally different styles.) The bamboo attracted me to these sunglasses and they do not disappoint! They are lightweight, without feeling flimsy. The flex bands on the arms are great, especially if my kiddos get their hands on them. The lens colour is sort of a dark amber - I love how everything looks around me while wearing them (very vibrant). I live in the desert and with temps consistently around 110 for the summer months, it's nice to wear something on your face that isn't hot to the touch and that I can wear in and out of the pool. The cork case is super cool. It gives the protection you want for your sunglasses, while looking natural, and collapses - all things noted in the description, but little/big things that are fun in person."
5.0,This top has a good amount of stretching a soft ribbed fabric.  The top comes down to show a little cleavage but not too much.  Its a good length and reaches the widest part of my hip.  The short sleeves come about 1/3 the way down my arm and are very flattering.  The navy blue looks just like the picture. I am very happy with it and considering buying more.
5.0,Fits perfectly. Feels sturdy.
5.0,My watches batteries always run down. So Im trying these. So far they have met my expectations and are beautiful
5.0,Great looking shirt and fits like a glove!
5.0,loved it!
5.0,My favorite dress! The quality is great and it looks so good on! I cannot wait to wear it again and again! 100% would recommend. I ordered a XL and it fit perfect!
5.0,Really pretty and the fit is perfect.
5.0,"I absolutely love these leggings! Very thick but flexible material, full support including the stomach area. They have a grainy texture, which makes look almost like skinny pants - perfect for winter long sweaters and tunics. If you work on your feet lots of hours every day, the leggings must be your choice! I have tested them for a couple of busy workdays, and I am confirming: no ankle swelling, no tingling or numbness in my legs, no sticking out belly or fat rolls! Will buy more."
5.0,I got this for a cosplay and it fits grate! The color is vibrant and it‚Äôs supper comfortable. Definitely worth the price.
5.0,Loooovve! Somewhat large but feels great!
5.0,"Product arrived on time, and delivered! They are super dainty and elegant, and match just about everything."
5.0,So many for so cheap!
5.0,"Love these glasses, came in a short time and are super cute!!!(:"
5.0,These look great and are a bit astute to boot.
5.0,I like the different design of this compass charm and it looks great as a pendant on a longer chain.
5.0,"High quality. Strong, sturdy. Great color too!"
5.0,One of my new faves!
5.0,Great bracelet. So pretty.  Only thing is if you are ordering this to have engraved and it's a long name need to make sure the plate is long enough.  I didn't realize that because the plate has a slight curve to it that the engraver was hindered in how large a font he could use due to how it had to be attached to the engraving machine.
5.0,Worn multiple times and love the fabric. Loose fitting with under cami or tank tops
5.0,This case fits so perfect for my 6plus slim and feels good üòçüòçüòçüòçüíØüíØüíØ
5.0,I enjoy this comfortable fit. It also washes up nice.
5.0,Exactly what I expected. Very good quality.
5.0,They keep my feet so nice and warm in winter and is a very durable boot. Can't go wrong with Uggs!
5.0,Quality of fabric is nice and soft.
5.0,Love them would probably size up if I bought again
5.0,Purchased for a family weekend and was money well spent.
5.0,Beautiful dress!!! I received many compliments!
5.0,Beautiful purse
5.0,Never bragged about sunglasses. But these are awesome. Ordered 2 more pair so that I have one in each car.
5.0,It is so gorgeous! It is perfect for a wedding or a special occasion!
5.0,Looks like the photo.<br />Comfortable.
5.0,I love this Murano glass bead.  The colors are brilliant and the bead itself is well manufactured.  Love this beautiful bead!
5.0,The headband is very pretty and well made.  The headband doesn't pinch.  I love the pads at the ends. Very comfortable.
5.0,Been wearing nightgowns for 40 years these are without a doubt the the most comfortable gown I've ever worn. Warm comfy perfect fit to size. First non cotton I've tried won't be going back. Thank you!
5.0,"I ordered a large and it is a bit big. But I recently lost 100 pounds.. I should have ordered medium, but I still LOVE this shirt! I'm 5'6 and 150 for reference."
5.0,Very impressed with the size and quality in proportion to cost.  Thank you!
5.0,"This particular band broke within a week, but bayite replaced it with a much nicer band that I still love. They are a great company to stand behind what they sell, and they make it right if the product is defective. Very easy to work with."
5.0,Very usefull!
5.0,I got this dress mainly from the image because it looked super comfortable. I went back and forth looking for a dress like this one and had little to no luck. I found this one and was a bit skeptical because it was 5 stars with 1 rating but I saw the brand selling the dress had a lot of good reviews so I thought why not give it a shot. Put it on and it looks just like the pictures! So cute cant wait to wear it. Highly recommend.
5.0,"These visors are DA BOMB! These are the BEST you can purchase! They are lightweight, stylish, no headache (GREAT name for them), and I wear mine everyday! I have several colors to match everything I wear!"
5.0,"I replaced all my socks with a combination of Darn Tough's socks. Work, hiking, gym, any activity imaginable is possible in these socks!"
5.0,Es perfecto. Un poco peque√±o pero muy cute.
5.0,"My girls want to be Astronauts. We have gone space mad over here and these were perfect.<br /><br />That being said, these are huge. These are not children‚Äôs sized earrings, and they aren‚Äôt for people who can‚Äôt wear heavy earrings.<br /><br />At the price point, they will still be fun for stockings, but they won‚Äôt get much wear for a few years."
5.0,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this dress. I'm not a dress girl but wanted something cute for an outdoor dinner party. It is perfect - comfortable, so cute and so easy to wear. Probably one of the best articles of clothing I've purchased on Amazon."
5.0,Received quickly and exactly as advertised.
5.0,Absolutely loved these. They look fantastic and have nosepads which always makes it easier to adjust. The polarized sunglasses is a must and I'm glad these glasses check off all the boxes I've been looking for. The only thing with these glasses is they are not top quality as you would expect since it is hard to adjust the temples but that was to be expected. I have a smaller head so the glasses fit me fine but can be tight for some.
5.0,"Love this hat, took a bit to get but its coming from china and well worth the wait!"
5.0,Love these sunglasses! Petite for my face. Love the dark lenses and black frames. Will purchase another pair.
5.0,My friend loved this! So beautiful and well made!
5.0,Good quality dress from a great seamstress. I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day. I sent in my custom measuments so I don't need to have it altered.
5.0,I wish the surgeon told me to get this shirt for the day of the surgery. It‚Äôs a must in my opinion (it should be standard with the sling before leaving the hospital)! Anyone getting shoulder surgery needs at least 1 of these shirts (I bought 2 so I could wear one while the other was being washed). I normally wear mens medium but I went with a large for comfort while sleeping. These shirts made getting in and out of a shirt sooooo much easier the first week or so (especially for my wife that was helping me dress) before I could move my arm a little. The material is extremely soft and it was very comfortable to sleep in. HIGHLY recommend.
5.0,I loved it it's so nice and neat everyone liked it / it's fit as expected
5.0,So soft and pockets!!!!!
5.0,buying more as these are fantastic for cold days just putzing around doing errands. Important to keep feet dry and warm.  Love the compression aspect of them.
5.0,I like the style of these belts. I bought buckles separately and need more belt options. This was the best option
5.0,"Good quality shirt, not too thin or stretchy. However, it is hard to tell by the graphics that this design represents the thirteenth legion and that was rather important to me personally."
5.0,These PJ‚Äôs are so soft & comfy!
5.0,I am not one to feel so in love with a product that I write a review but let me tell you I am going to buy as many pairs of these as I can. The material is stretchy and is excellent in quality. I ordered an XS. I struggle with the way leggings cut ... down there ... but the way these are made (like gymshark leggings) that‚Äôs no problem!! Buy them!! Totally worth it. Plus they make your butt look delicious.
5.0,This is very well made and very beautiful. I have worn it several times and get lots of compliments. It is a treasure.
5.0,"A gift for freshmen, loved it, the color and warmth is amazing"
5.0,My husband loves this mese tank to work out in.. this is the 3rd set we bought..
5.0,"Such great quality!! Highly suggest for a lightweight, cover. Not only was the fabric so flattering, but could be easily be dressed up or down. Definitely would purchase again."
5.0,Nice tie the band itself was a little narrow
5.0,"Thanks to all other reviewers for providing such great advice and detail.  I just keep winning with things I've been picking off of Amazon.  This belt duo is no exception.<br /><br />This is a duo of 1 silver and 1 gold thin stretchy belts.  The entirety of these belts is metal, which is also somehow stretchy, like a Slinky!  Amazing.  I am a size 16/18, and wear an L/XL and XL/XXL in Asian sizes on Amazon.  I brought these on a summer vacation recently, and paired with several summery maxis and skater dresses. So many compliments!!  These belts are a great buy, one of my favorite so far!  The price is such a great value, and the end look is always polished (no pun intended har har).  Just a note, the metal is shiny but not ridiculously so-- just perfect to add a little gilt to your outfit!"
5.0,"In love with this swim suit! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 160lbs 36D and the L fits and look perfect on me."
5.0,"Nice material, fits as expected. Will purchase more."

5.0,Bought it for my daughter to be Veruka Salt in a play.  She is a size 2-4 in women's and it fit perfectly.  Good quality.
5.0,"Fantastic dress, and great quality for the price. Although the dress fits a little bit too large in the chest area, I can fix it with minimum effort (not the fault of the seller, the dress is the advertised size). Dress arrived exactly in the dates promised."

5.0,Bought for my teenager he loves it.
5.0,Looks exactly just like the picture. Looks super classy and great for spring. I used mine as a neck scarf with a red trench coat.
5.0,Material and colour pretty much same as in the picture and product was really nice.
5.0,Me encantaron
5.0,"it is very good , works very well"
5.0,Bought for my husband for a hawaii trip and that's all he wanted to wear there.
5.0,The dress was as expected. .I love it
5.0,"These are very hard to fit because people have very different toes. These fit someone who normally wears size US women's 5.5. She usually wears child size 3 or Euro 36, but in these, she took a size 37. She had surgery for arthritis and hopes to straighten her toes by wearing these. She's 86 years old and loves these! Her 8 year old granddaughter wanted to take them from her."
5.0,My daughter wears these every day.  The only downside is the decorations come loose but I have a glue gun and we just pop them back on.  Either way (decorated or not) my little girl wears them ALL THE TIME.
5.0,"Beautiful sweater! I have a thin build, so I ordered a small. It fits great. My chest is 38, waist is 29, hight is 5'6, and weight is 140. It looks as pictured. Sweater is warm and cozy."
5.0,"The fit was as expected, no issues.  Great for working out in hot weather.  I like them."
5.0,Many people have thought this an exclusive Rolex! Great buy.
5.0,I am in love! These are absolutely gorgeous! They fit perfectly and don't fall out at night which is a huge plus!<br /><br />*update<br />I purchased these back in February. I loved them (and still do) the only bad thing was one of the inlays has fallen out. Not certain where or when it happened. I'm really sad because I absolutely adore them!
5.0,We had a cowboy themed party and this was perfect for my husband. He used it for about 8 hours and it held up fine! It fit a little weird on his belt but we made it work.
5.0,Well made and keeps its shape. Great elastic/adjustable band inside and ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù holes. Hubby loves it; on and off the course.
5.0,Hhhb
5.0,I love this skirt. And it has pockets!!!
5.0,This coat is my best friend after swim<br />I love it!<br />LS
5.0,As described and I got them the next day. Awesome seller.
5.0,Product worked as described.
5.0,Loved this watch . . . wearing it now.
5.0,I bought this for a gift. My friend has trouble regulating her body temperature while swimming in Lake Erie during summer fun. This item has significantly helped hold in her body/torso heat. Consider the sizing carefully. You may lean toward the one up size.
5.0,"Even prettier in person, this bracelet is light-weight, easy to get on and off (without pinching like some bangles do), and just the right size. It doesnt bounce around my wrist so the front of the bracelet is never moved over to the side. That drives me crazy when you can't see the bracelet design because it doesnt stay in place. This is exactly what I hoped it would be and so much more."
5.0,my friend love it :)
5.0,"A great present for your loved ones,my daughter won't take it off ;)"
5.0,"I'm a Physical Therapist in a hospital and can't make it through 8 hours on my feet without compression socks/sleeves.  These are my favorite.  I'm 5'-3&#34; and these aren't too long.  I bought the XS-S size.  The compression rating on these is 20-30 mmHg, which is perfect.  15-20 mmHg is not enough."
5.0,The yellow and pink looked great together
5.0,This looks great! I love it.I wish it comes in more color.
5.0,Great for the kids! Remakes a tired looking pair of shoes!
5.0,Very happy with this purchase. Great quality.

5.0,Granddaughter loves her dance costume.  She loves to play dress up with her sister and they come up with all kinds of idea's to add to costume
5.0,Saved my life. I couldn't find a lobster swimsuit to match my boyfriend and our sons and this tied all the swimsuits together. Its perfect
5.0,"Great fit, looks great, and great protection when I dropped my phone."
5.0,"Well made, nice and chic glasses.  I would recommende."

5.0,Good quality and kids like it so much
5.0,"I have a couple of these now and plan on getting a couple more.  They are very comfortable and work great for (my) longer rides, around 30 miles.  Not sure how they'll work on longer than that but I'll find out soon."
5.0,WOW
5.0,Love it!  Lots of room and looks really classy!
5.0,Is good quality. Love the print.
5.0,I was looking for some fall earrings that had silver accents and these worked perfectly for me.  They are nicer in person than in the pictures and are a very comfortable weight and curve.  I am very pleased with them and they match a variety of my fall outfits.
5.0,"Beautiful, great price, goes well with silver and green"
5.0,I love the look and the price is much better than the ridiculous over priced jewelry store version.
5.0,"Loved this product, it is exactly what I was shopping for.  I had purchased another product, but wasn't as happy with them as I am with these. They are fabulous and if you are shopping for sun glass holders, these are the best. I love the woven cord in a selection of colors.  I can't say enough about this product.  Go out and get these now, you won't be sorry you did."
5.0,This was perfect for tying your tshirt on the side instead of struggling with a knot. I have people ask me where I got them and since you get 10 in a bag I have a few out!
5.0,"Look great, just what I was looking for! I wear it everyday and it looks perfect"
5.0,"Beautiful form fitting blouse. with a skirt, or leggings, it looks very expensive and high fashion. the only problem is that it's way too big. Allegra K needs to work on not making their clothes so huge... This is definately worth buying."
5.0,"I don't write many reviews but this product is one of my absolute favorites. The most comfortable &#34;jeans&#34; ever. Nice weight, wash well and do not shrink or wrinkle. Have two pairs and will be ordering more today."

5.0,Worked well for wife in Dan Diego at beach

5.0,Ordered three for my three daughters! Love the packaging it came in! Very pleased & excited to give the necklaces to my daughters for a early Christmas present since we all live in separate states & countries but are meeting up in a few weeks for one of my daughters wedding! Love that the jewelry is made by retired moms(which I am the same). If you are considering purchasing this don't hesitate & read the history on the seller. That is what sold me on the product! Shipped here to Hawaii within a week! Mahalo!

5.0,We Purchase masks for every holiday; these were decent quality and had good prints. Everyone had their green on for St. Patty's day

5.0,I love this dress. I received so many compliments! You can dress it up or down depending on your accessories and shoes. I would purchase again in a different color.
5.0,Elegante y pr√°ctico
5.0,My friend loved this gift.  Very well made.
5.0,Other than the fact that I had to learn how to tie it... it's great quality.
5.0,"I usually have trouble with low socks staying on my heels, but these were great. Lightweight, but supportive, and stayed on. I would recommend."
5.0,These earrings were even nicer than I expected.  Great quality pearls and the design looks fantastic!
5.0,Love this top.  It's cute & very comfy.
5.0,Love Russell.
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 112lbs and my inseam in a 33‚Äù-34‚Äù and these are actually long and stay below my ankles, unlike other leggings! I have ordered a ton of these for yoga!! I love them!!"
5.0,"Handy when it rarely rains here. Dries fast, doesn't shrink or blow off in the wind easily."
5.0,"It‚Äôs a little smaller than I expected, but still looks good. I like it."
5.0,I‚Äôve been buying a lot of high wasted panties lately and these are the best!!! They have a little extra tummy control around the waste area so it snugs you waste in a little. It‚Äôs not to control your belly in or anything but I just just that extra snug. So glad I got these!
5.0,"Love the unique youthful design. The upper mesh upper portion of the dress is adorable. The lower 3/4 of the dress comprises thick material, so that it's not see-through. Wish the fabric weren't that rough, but it's somewhat bearable to wear -- & may be better designed with softer fabric lining."
5.0,It's a little bigger than I had but it holds more cards. It's sturdy enough to carry in my pocket.
5.0,It was just what I wanted. No more losing my keys as it is now attached to my purse.
5.0,So beautiful and high quality. highly recommend
5.0,Love love this grown it‚Äôs light & it‚Äôs cotton great for hot summers nights to sleep in & for me it‚Äôs not too long it comes to the knees  I‚Äôm 6Ft . I‚Äôm ordering a few more in the other colors
5.0,"Measurements: 5‚Äô4  36B - 30waist- 40hips.  Dress is comfortable, length to my knees.  I bought the yellow and red dress all medium size. Great for a date  night and even church attire.  Dress fits perfect and I received lots of compliments."
5.0,These fit great and are very comfortable - going to buy more!
5.0,Just as expected !
5.0,I purchased this necklace with zero reviews posted so I knew it was a bit risky.  I'm so happy I took a chance on this necklace.  It looks amazing!  It has a nice weight to it and looks much better than similar necklaces I have seen for this price range.  It will be a great addition to basic outfits to jazz them up a bit.  Love it!
5.0,Perfect!  My daughter wore it to a performance of Wizard of Oz and was a big hit!
5.0,Exceeded expectations for both beauty and quality!
5.0,I love this earrings so much. They have become my daily earrings as they don't hurt my highly sensitive ears. AND they are soo cute.

5.0,Super soft and comfy. Love it
5.0,I liked that it is easy to put on and protects the baby from the sun.
5.0,I love it has 6 different pockets I would buy it again.
5.0,I use this in the winter months when I cycle to work. I've worn it in temperatures as low as 0F (-20F with windchill) and it worked great. Thin enough to go under my helmet and warm enough for some pretty frigid rides.
5.0,"Heads up: This product is not overnight. You're going to be receiving it either 2 weeks for 20 bucks in shipping or 1.5 months in normal shipping just because it's literally being customized, made, and shipped from China directly. But it is a fantastic gift if you plan ahead. Really heart felt."
5.0,High Quality Product
5.0,This handbag is very beautiful and practical...it is big and well made...
5.0,Perfect for layering under clothes. Fit as expected.

5.0,"Perfect fix , my 3 year old love this pjs"

5.0,Very stylish and cute. Super light weight on my ears. Love the colors goes with a lot of different outfits!
5.0,"I LOVE this watch! Its beautiful, looks like the picture, and was super inexpensive."
5.0,fit well  comfy and cute
5.0,We turned these flashlights on and put inside of the plastic Easter eggs for a night time egg hunt. Awesome. Got several other glow in the dark toys and glow sticks and this was the only thing that worked to see the eggs at night. Even the grown ups were snagging these flashlights from their kids because they are so cool. Great deal for the price.
5.0,"For what these are and what they cost, these are amazing.  The spectrum reflected it truly a rainbow though with flits of orangey red on one end of the spectrum.  Lenses turn the world blue when peered through."
5.0,Love this purse!  It can hold more than it appears.  Used it for traveling on an airplane.  Definitely felt safer with the cross body and added security lining.  Took the strap off and use as wallet in my purse now.
5.0,Just as pictured. I've had it over a month and still looks good.
5.0,Perfect fit love the quality
5.0,"That 85 feel, Originals! #Adidas Love"
5.0,"Very nice shoes,love them ,great seller .Thanks"
5.0,"I found these shorts oddly very nice for the price. It says lightweight but their more like midweight maybe, which is a very good thing. They are thicker than normal female shorts and the material used is nice quality. Nothing see through and as someone with a booty, these fit well and don't feel tight anywhere. 10/10 wold recommend."
5.0,Cute. True to size
5.0,I've looked around for a while to find my husband a nice watch that he can wear daily or when we go out to dinner.  He's wanted a new one for a long time and is very particular when it comes to style.  He likes cutting edge toys and to look good so I wanted to make sure I got him a watch that fit him perfectly!  This watch did the job!<br /><br />This watch is very elegant and manly.  The outside of the watch and the bad are all brushed light silver.  The clasp itself closes pretty good and stays tight while you're wearing it.  My husband had to take out 2 links in order for it to fit him perfectly but it's nice to have two spares in case something goes wrong.<br /><br />The face is awesome.The hands are blue and white.  This watch tracks both 12 hour time and 24 hour time.  It will also track the days of the week which is a nice extra on top.  Overall this watch is very nice and has really nice weight to it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.  I have no affiliation with the seller or manufacturer.
5.0,Wife loves it...
5.0,It is perfect for my purposes;
5.0,Great costume
5.0,Hubby loves it on me and it makes the most of my best assets.

5.0,"These are one of my two favorite work pants. They are comfortable, sturdy, good pockets, not too hot, and I get a lot of compliments."

5.0,I love this brand!
5.0,Good product exactly like photo
5.0,I couldnt find a rain jacket under $35 for a 6+ year old anywhere. This jacket is the quality you pay for. No issues as of yet but have a feeling it wont survive being a hand-me-down...which is fine! It does the job and my daughter loves it
5.0,This is my second set of these bc all my kids fight over these masks!  Good colors...fits their faces perfectly!!!
5.0,"Got these to be able to see displays in the car, the Dragons originally came with polarized lenses and made it hard to see. The Revant lenses are a nice tint and fit good and snug in frame.  Great upgrade."
5.0,"Adorable. I wore this to a high school graduation and it as light but cute. Great style, adorable and doesn't make me look like a little girl ."
5.0,"I am very pleased with my watch purchase. I have large wrists, and it fits me perfectly right out of the box with no adjustments. Nice weight.."
5.0,"These guys really nailed my taste in colors!  The colors are not bright (the red is the brightest by far, and even it is a bit subdued), and there are lots of fine black horizontal threads woven into the fabric.  It looks awesome, especially in the green.  Too cold here at the moment to comment on the shirts wicking away moisture, but I'm really happy with how they look.  They are perhaps a tad larger than I was expecting, but not too bad."
5.0,Great item and fit perfectly
5.0,Works as it is supposed to work
5.0,Ordered these for my 4 year old son and am very pleased with them. They fit just right as hiking or everyday socks on him and they even fit our two year old son as hiking socks. I will be ordering more soon.
5.0,"I really am happy with this mask.  It is polyester & cotton, exactly the recommended fabric, and has an inner pocket for a replaceable filter.  It fits well and can be adjusted easily to make it tighter or looser just by adjusting the ear cords.  Plus the dancing bears make me happy!"
5.0,Super cute! Looked just like they do in the picture! :)
5.0,This to me is the best Bra on the market. The fit was the thing that I was really looking for. Also the support Is just  blowing my mind right now. I'm in love with this bra.
5.0,"Wore this dress last night for a gala. Gorgeous! Form fitting, sexy, comfortable. So many compliments! Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,I especially appreciate the thicker band that fits across my forehead. I work in some long cases and sweating is not unusual.
5.0,"Top quality part,huge improvement over stock.increased accuracy and the ability to add a scope.<br />Nice finish,a 1/8&#34; longer bolt would be nice<br /><br />Supplier has fast shipping"
5.0,I love these rings so much. I‚Äôm a cook so wearing my real rings to work is a no no. I‚Äôve been wearing these for a week and haven‚Äôt even wanted to put my real rings back on. I love that I can color cordinate with my outfit.
5.0,This arrived earlier than projected by the company. It is beautiful and true to the color depicted. I would purchase from this company again.
5.0,Perfect fit and very comfortable
5.0,"This is a lovely watch! It fits nicely on my wrist, and isn't too big or too small (but I have a large wrist).  It does not feel like real leather, but I am fine with that and the gold polka dots are not just painted on, they are actually raised a little bit.  The packaging it came in was a little watch case and where your turn the nob to change the time, there is a little piece of plastic in between that, so the watch is not on ( so don't freak out if your watch isn't working, its because of this and once you remove it and push down its fine).  It works like a charm and looks beautiful!"
5.0,We got all super cute pins. All the ones my daughter wanted. Extremely happy
5.0,Grandson loves this large mat. Lots of room and bright colors.
5.0,Wore one of the 2 really cool necklaces I received for a Bellatrix Lestrange cosplay...it was perfect! Look forward to wearing the other one sometime soon. Definitely recommend.

5.0,"Great quality sweatshirt. Very soft and warm. It fits as expected so order your normal size. As far as the quality I found it to be very similar in feel and weight to Champion. The sweatshirt looks great with jeans and or sweats. Overall, for the price I'm highly satisfied with the purchase. Would purchase another in the future"
5.0,These are awesome! They are comfy and I like the grip on the bottom.
5.0,Super super cute...BUT the reviews r wrong for smaller sizes...i usually wear a size 2-3 & ordered a 2 & they r a little big. I'd stick with your original size or poss order down a size if u r smaller.
5.0,I like this belt.
5.0,"These are beautiful earrings - they gleam and glitter when they catch the light, are very swingy, and garner lots of attention.  The  green stone looks like a huge, fine emerald and the gold-plated earring itself looks like find quality.  Anyone who loves to get dressed up will love these!  Perfect gift for a granddaughter!"
5.0,My daughter loved these tattoos!

5.0,"Great product, works really well!  Very happy with purchase."
5.0,These are perfect for doubling up a necklace that has no clasp. I like having one of each color to go with everything.
5.0,My daughter loves them! Nice and warm!
5.0,6 months into the school year and this lunch box is holding up amazing!! I‚Äôm impressed!
5.0,"Am very pleased with these masks, the best I‚Äôve bought so far"
5.0,Nothing to dislike!  Great looks! Great fit!
5.0,"Perfect for baby photos!!! I love the skirt, so adorableeee. I can‚Äôt get over it!!"
5.0,Great fit and perfect school shoes
5.0,zlovrd it.
5.0,Works great as a bag! Haha
5.0,Great product. Nice stretch for good fit. True to size and very pretty embroidery is a bonus. Perfect value.
5.0,"It serves the purpose for my job, thank you"
5.0,Product was perfect. It was a gift and my daughter loved it.
5.0,Love the cosplay. Fits perfectly. Although I would say I am still trying to figure out how to get the black bow on with the safe pin and how to keep the hat on the wig. Other wise it is a perfect cosplay outfit. Also you may find that you need to go up a size from normal. I normally a large and I wound up needing an extra large
5.0,Fits really well.
5.0,"The main bag is pretty, sturdy and roomy with a variety of zippered storage options. The shoulder strap is great for me, since I need to use a cane to walk distance and need a purse to be out of the way. The smaller bags are good to sort things into. The medium bag has my wallet and a few essentials and can be removed to carry separately. The scene on the bag is fun and colorful. I would recommend this set for anyone who needs a nice shoulder bag with a smaller bag option."
5.0,Muy comodos de utilizar tanto de dia como de noche
5.0,"Beautiful color & pearls match well. Nicely priced. Hang straight, about 1"" from lobe. Classy earrings, arrived quickly."
5.0,"I was so pissed one morning when I found my favorite flip flops that I'd had for 4 years chewed up by my puppy.  I bought them while on vacation, so I wasn't sure I'd find a replacement that was as good as these.<br /><br />The leather shapes perfectly to my feet.<br /><br />I was soooooooo happy I found them here on Amazon!<br /><br />My only advice, as with most flip flops, you have to wear them with socks for a while so they form well to your foot and stretch out so they don't hurt the upper part of your foot.  I know, socks and flipflops?!!!  But it works!<br /><br />Enjoy."
5.0,The size is perfect for fitting it on over a coverall. It is very nice for my job and I love it.
5.0,use them every day under my cycling helmet
5.0,Got my man a first place at the 70s 80s theme party!
5.0,This bracelet is perfect! I love how dainty it is. It came packaged in a sweet little box that would make it very easy to gift. The clasp isn't as tricky as I thought it would be and the dangling chain on the end adds a nice little bit of interest to my wrist. Great to wear everyday.
5.0,Very pleased with the fit and look. Comfy and of a good weight.
5.0,Perfect party wear..loved the fabric.. simple yet beautiful

5.0,"These little socks were fantastic for my little guy when he was just starting to walk in the winter time &amp; I wanted to make sure and keep his feet warm, but also didn't want him to slip and fall on our tile floors. These socks are non-skid so they did the trick! Plus they are awfully cute."

5.0,Ordered for a coworker's retirement celebration.  Arrived in time.  Everyone loved the vintage design.  Wore it with the batman mask sunglasses.
5.0,"These reusable produce bags are a staple in my grocery shopping! With all the fresh fruits and veggies I purchase for my family, they have been so worth the buy!"
5.0,love this tee it is so soft... a good thing I bought some other Yellowstone designs... have not noticed any shrinkage after wash/drying... definitely will be on the lookout for new designs!

5.0,Boyfriend loves it!
5.0,Works as they say
5.0,"Such nice sweatshirts.  I get compliments!  Beefy construction, nifty little V detail at the neck.  Nice fabric, classy colors.  I‚Äôve tried several brands and Russell delivers consistent satisfaction at a good price.  And it‚Äôs refreshing to find casual clothing not made in China!  My advice: look no further, this is the good stuff."
5.0,Muy suave
5.0,Got this for my boyfriend and fits him perfectly and loving the material
5.0,I got a small and it fit perfectly I love it
5.0,"Cool, I scored some brownie points when I bought this for my wife LOL"
5.0,Does indeed change color with temperature. Must be facing a good light source or else it appears black. Appears clear from the side. The inside of the ring has a gap in the metal so your skin can touch the color-changing material. Photos show change from room temperature (orange/brown) to the temperature of my index finger (deep blue.)
5.0,"This shirt is excellent. It fits well, doesnt need to be ironed, and looks outstanding. Its easily one if my most complimented articles of clothing."
5.0,This belly piercing jewelry was a cutie. It was silver and had a Jamaican flag on it. It wiggles. You can even change the top ball. You just have to be taking care of your jewelry and it won‚Äôt break. If it breaks it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre being too rough. And if it breaks just learn how to put it back on. Thank God for just giving you the money to even purchase.
5.0,Got this for my husband and he loved it. Hes gotten so many compliments. Its a durable material looks great.
5.0,We got this for my son's 14th birthday and he loved it
5.0,"Thicker than expected. There is extra lining in the front too, so that it doesn't show the chest."
5.0,"Muy hermoso, buen material,"
5.0,"WORKS  GREAT,  NO  PROBLEMS,  THANK  YOU..."
5.0,love them. great quality!
5.0,"It's made out of a felt material, but I don't mind it at all! I got this in the grey color, and every time I wear it I always get compliments. I plan to order the camel color soon as well. Just be careful ironing this type of material as it burns easily :)"
5.0,Great little watch.  Looks so nice on the wrist.  Kudos to the manufacturer for making it and supplier for carrying it.
5.0,So much better than cotton socks.  They are perfect to weak with slacks and dress shoes.  I have tried other brands but they just don't work as well.  I will definitely purchase again.
5.0,Definitely was worried at first reading reviews I just got it this jacket nice as hell good work 5 stars could be a Lil bigger being as tho I got the biggest size they had a us L could have been a Lil bigger well done I'll be back for redüëç
5.0,"I wear these all the time, and they are amazing.<br />If you want some cute plugs, these are it.<br />If you are used to wearing single-flare plugs, you may have to work these in gently, or stretch your lobes a little more with a tapper.<br />They are very classy plugs and look good with just about any outfit. They are real, natural stone, as advertised."
5.0,.fast shipping exact size.
5.0,"Every pair of these gloves is cute. My 3 year old granddaughter grabbed the purple ones with delight. They fit her well, no strings to impede her fingers going in.<br /><br />They are more than substantial enough for winter in Chicago, for snow playing probably would have to have an under layer.<br /><br />I put the other pairs away as we all know she will lose a couple over the winter.<br /><br />Great value."
5.0,Great quality but fit more on the larger side! Our daughter will be 4 in two months and is on the tall side and they are a little too long.
5.0,It's a good quality leotard.good quality fabric looks nice and comfortable.i got it for my daughter or gymnastics and he loves it
5.0,"So soft, nice quality. Great for cosplay."
5.0,"I decided to try this because of the price.  Already, it's sterling and not just plated.  We both think it's awesome.  I think it would actually look cheaper if it was larger;  it actually seems a nice size.  It's delicate yet notably visible.  The color is excellent.  This is an example of why it's so nice to have amazon;  you can come across finds like this.  I'm writing the review because I commend the seller who could be charging a lot more.  Great product."
5.0,I wanted a bag for commuting that could hold all my stuff and this one fits the bill.  I like the fact that it also has a back pocket and you can zip it closed.
5.0,very pretty . love it
5.0,Amazing! I love them so much! They are almost like a photo paper and are extremely high quality for the price. Would recommend to anyone that's an Army.
5.0,I own Lululemon‚Äôs and these are so comparable to their semi compression workout leggings I have the exact same pair and I couldn‚Äôt tell you which one is which amazing.
5.0,Loved this sweater! Wear it all the time!
5.0,"I was very pleased with the side eye glass safety shields. Not knowing what to expect, the soft plastic was clear and didn‚Äôt impair vision. They fit and slide over the temples and secure easily on the outside edge of the frames. The open gap on the sides is blocked by the shields protecting the eyes from objects hitting an eye. Having 8 on hand is nice too.<br />Charles Welch"
5.0,"My granddaughter loves them,now she wants another color!!!"
5.0,"I bought two of these for my husband and me (one brown, one black) for our trip to St. Martin.  The size was perfect for his back pocket and for my small purse.  I wanted something to use as a flat wallet, as well as my passport.  It held the passport perfectly, and I liked the slots for my driver's license and a credit card.  I was also able to put cash in it."
5.0,It fits perfect and great gift she loves it thank you
5.0,Wheels for what I needed.
5.0,Very comfortable and true to size!! Excellent product Thank you!!
5.0,Stunning.
5.0,"I love these shoes, very comfortable and darling on.  I highly recommend!!"
5.0,Great quality for a great price! My little one loves his new socks! Every day he is a different superhero üíô . Great after several washes too.. I would recommend!
5.0,We did receive the Panda Bear Hoodie and my daughter LOVED it!!!  It was exactly as shown on the website and fits her perfectly.
5.0,"It's a great addition to my Jedi and Sith outfits. This time I bought the blue piece. The material is solid and comfortable. The size is perfect (medium). I like the addition of the Velcro added to the shoulders and belts to hold the should belts in place. The suit is as good as other suits from other vendors - but at about half the costs. This was a great buy!<br /><br />The one thing I'll mention that purchasers need to be aware of is with the colors. The lighting in the ad photo makes the base (Tunic and pants) look Royal Blue, but it's actually Navy Blue. Even though my favorite color is Royal Blue, I'm not bothered that it is actually Navy Blue. The sash and other belts are a lighter, and very nicely done, complimentary color to the Tunic and pants that makes it all work. If you're happy with any type of blue, you'll love it. If you are looking for Royal Blue, don't expect it, but if you do get it anyway, you won't be disappointed. The colors are great together.<br /><br />I'm happy with my purchase."
5.0,Delivered fast! Exactly as described. High quality materials. Very classy. Definitely recommend.
5.0,Fitted perfectly
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 177 pounds. I‚Äôm also currently breastfeeding and was looking for a dress that would be easy to feed my baby in. This dress fits perfectly and is super flattering. My weight is in my stomach. The dress fits in a way that flatters my bustline and draws attention away from my stomach. The pattern is gorgeous. I love the deep teal color! I‚Äôm very fair skinned with dark hair, and I was worried about it being more of the aqua color that looks best on blondes. This dress is perfect for any hair color! I really think it would look gorgeous on a fair skinned redhead, too. The v-neck and side rouching look very nice and doesn‚Äôt come down far enough to show cleavage. Perfect for modesty at church! The price was right. The fabric is comfy. The style is adorable. This dress is a win all around!"
5.0,"The fit is great since it is a velcro back and I was worried it was  going to be tall or just not look good, but its great! The material is good quality and made very well. i am very happy with it and cant wait to wear it this weekend!"
5.0,The color is rich and the bag looks high quality.
5.0,This shoe looks super cute on my child's feet but they should make the velcro strap a little longer because I couldn't get it closed other than that the shoe fits well.
5.0,"I just bought a slew of clothing on amazon for an upcoming vacation, the vast majority are going back, but thisperfect little summer dress is staying!!!  5.9 curvy, and the dress is not too short. It's above knee but not mid thigh. Printed materia- very soft with stretch and  it really feels like it will hold its shape.  At this price I'll be grabbing more.  Really cute!  Thanks!  Love it!"
5.0,"They fit perfectly, and they're so elegant and soft."
5.0,I have a small face so they fit really good..very happy with them.
5.0,I couldn‚Äôt believe how much stuff came in this package compared to how much we would have gotten for the same price at the local party store! I cut out the train and conductor from two of the plates to use as decorations. So cute!
5.0,This came quickly and is great quality for the price.  I look forward to wearing it soon.  I love Amazon for its good deals!
5.0,"The medium dress fit a 5'4&#34; 140 pound figure perfectly.  The material is more of a spandex type material than the more cotton stretch fabric this type of dress is normally made of.  But, this fabric when compared to a dress that is made of the more cotton fabric shows less flaws while the cotton fabric shows every bump and dimple imperfection if you have any.  Also this dress has a back zipper that makes it easier to put on than other similar dresses with no zipper."
5.0,Came in the package safe a had no problems with them.
5.0,Granddaughter love the slippers
5.0,"This is super cute! It fits perfectly and goes well with a white shirt. The zipper isn't the best quality, but as long as you're gentle it's fine."
5.0,Bought to wear to a roaring 20's wedding and absolutely loved it. Got many compliments on it. The only thing I did not like is how short it was but after looking at other flapper dresses that was the style.
5.0,"These socks are wonderful.  Very easy to slip on.  Stay up on your leg but do not leave a squeeze ring around your calf.  Soft and warm, I love them.<br /><br />I have large diameter legs and don't really get along that well with 'regular' socks.  These are the best and worth every penny paid."
5.0,It's a Christmas gift but I am sure he will like it
5.0,My son got this for Christmas and refused to take it off!
5.0,"This is an awesome hat! It was purchased for a costume, but I will use it many timea after. I have a fairly big head and have a hard time finding a good fit, but the L/XL is perfect."
5.0,"Very durable, my toddler is tough on stuff but these sunglasses seem to be holding up really well."
5.0,Was going to give it to my daughter in law but oh well... she never really thanked me just like her daughter! So I decided to keep it for myself!! Ha you're welcomeü§£
5.0,Great colour.  Could be worn as a sundress. Nice fabric
5.0,Wear this all the time and I love it!
5.0,I like the color of the navy and ordered a black one as well
5.0,Sit was great he looked absolutely wonderful in his costume
5.0,Ordered for myself and 2 others if you have xbox1 controller this is the best deal and quality for the price am buying another set of three today
5.0,My grandson loved his new slippers and could put them on my himself.
5.0,Great thanksgiving tie
5.0,"I am so excited! I am 9 months pregnant and bought these for breastfeeding but then instead of selling it or giving it away, I can then keep using it in the gym! Win win!"
5.0,Sz  medium
5.0,Perfect fit for my 10 years old.
5.0,Lasted 2 months and counting every day doing construction bought a few more for some friends
5.0,These are great! I got Large for the High School Boys I coach. The vests are super lightweight and much brighter in person.
5.0,Comfy face mask. Nice and soft to wear as needed. Fits well.
5.0,"I guess my ears are somewhat odd shaped, the loops of regular face masks never stay on easily as it appears for everyone else.  I prefer this style of balaclava, yes I know it isn't what they are recommending but it's better than nothing and no one is beating the tar out of me (true story, we saw a younger lady beat the tar out of an older lady at that people of W... type store for the ""crime"" of not being able to wear a mask.)  Anyway, this balaclava (not to be confused with the yummy desert baklava!) is perfect for these crazy times, easy to wash so not causing rashes or lung infections. Btw this balaclava has more uses than simply for the virus.  We've begun wearing these in dusty tasks such as mowing on a dry day and working around our poultry. They'd be great when working around dry hay, too so we'll be using this long past when the vaccine is readily available.  As for sizing, we're a 2XLT type household and this balaclava is a bit snug but still comfortable and far roomier than others we've tried to use. If the ear slits won't stay in place it won't slide down which is the problem I deal with on regular masks."
5.0,"I thought this sun hat for an Australia and New Zealand trip. It worked very well. It packed well and could scrunch into a suitcase or bag. It tends to run slightly larger which works good for my head size. The flower adds a nice detail. I was really pleased with this wide brim, as this sun is very bright in Australia and New Zealand.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hat for the beach or traveling."
5.0,"Pretty, soft, washes well, great buy."
5.0,I had a slight problem with my order and the problem was corrected with no hassle and very fast. I will definitely purchase again in the future and my necklace is beautiful!!
5.0,"5'5"", 135lbs, ordered a Small. I wanted a fun sundress for the summer and that's exactly what I got. It's a lightweight, comfortable material that feels nice on my skin. The fit is exactly what I was looking for. The color was just like the pictures on the website. I'm just so happy with this purchase. Something to note, the tie on the dress is standalone so you can choose to use it or not. I personally think it adds to the cuteness of this look but it's personal preference."
5.0,These were great. They were comfortable and I got a lot of compliments on them.
5.0,These are very good for my natural curly hair.  I put one on before I lay down to sleep and wake to only have to do little to to make right.
5.0,"Item delivered on time, was as described<br />to what it was on line."
5.0,"Very good tie for the price, and the right color as in the picture. Also shipped quickly :)"
5.0,"Got this belt to wear for a wedding. The ratchet mechanism is really well built. Everyone at the wedding loved how elegant it looked. You can tell it‚Äôs not those as seen on tv branded ratchet belts. Everything is top notch from the ratchet to the belt itself. Works like it should. I think the release lever could be more accessible. Sometimes it takes a couple seconds to release the ratchet. Forget my wife though, she can‚Äôt get it off when she‚Äôs in the mood if her life depended on it."
5.0,"Loved em, got one for my wife and I...yeah she likes to match on stuff like this hahaha but anyways they are pretty cool:"
5.0,It's worth more than its priced ! Better than the version at party city ! The hair is very nice material not that other stuff that goes into knots after the wind blows. They include batteries and all. The effects are awesome ! I truly recommend this . Everyone love the mask and it was pretty much unique compared to other lame pennywise masks.
5.0,"It's roomy, but not to big. I could have ordered a size smaller, but it's just fine the way it is."
5.0,"This jumpsuit is literally everything! There‚Äôs no chemical smell whatsoever & the fit is amazing. I purchased a large (5‚Äô7/155lbs). You can dress it up with a pair of heels (even show some side boob!) or wear it casual with some Vans. Heads up, the fabric is on the thicker side. Not the best idea to wear  on a hot summer day in Arizona."
5.0,Right fit
5.0,"I got this as a gift for my mom who loves unicorns and the movie. She actually wears it. It looks like the picture and is a good length. If you know someone who like a little bit longer necklaces and The Last Unicorn, this is a great unique gift."
5.0,"Love them, but maybe buy one size bigger."
5.0,"They are adorable trust me, I'm not a fan of writing reviews. My twin girls love them."
5.0,4th order. Nice to give away.
5.0,OK so maybe color is not as teal as in picture. But still beautiful.  I have to cut a couple loose threads here and there but that's ok. Fits nicely I'm 5'4 and  107 lbs. .. I purchased a small.
5.0,Purchased these for aqua aerobics and they are perfect. The sole protects my feet from abrasion while exercising. They are comfortable and quick drying. I will also use these for kayaking and other wet-foot activities. Highly recommend.
5.0,"Great product for the little one learning to walk and comfy. They do not come off easily, so child will not pull them off in the crib. Keeps them safe on slippery house floors and very fashionable."
5.0,"Big a worth the price, but mine didn‚Äôt even come with a stone"
5.0,We purchased these and fishing weights to hang from the bottom or our outdoor curtains to keep them from blowing in the wind.  They are perfect for our needs.
5.0,"Fit perfect,nice and thick"
5.0,Es muy calentito
5.0,Wore it to a Christmas party and it fit exactly as described. Comfortable and stretchy
5.0,these are pretty cute.
5.0,"Very cute shirt,  but runs small.  I normally buy xl and ordered a 3x  and it fits like a large.  Wish I would've ordered the 4x.  I'm 5'9&#34; and weigh around 155#"
5.0,Pants fit great! They are very comfortable to walk in. Stretchy fabric and they stay up.
5.0,"I'm forever losing sunglasses. For that reason I never like to spend big bucks. These were a good compromise. Light weight, decent quality for a reasonable price. Liked them so much, bought 2nd pair"
5.0,Perfect as described.
5.0,Nice shoes well made
5.0,My kid loved this cosplay!!!!!!
5.0,Light weight and very comfortable! Color is gorgeous
5.0,These are super sure and flattering I love them
5.0,"Exactly as expected.  Soft, warm, and wraps around perfect - 2 x‚Äôs."
5.0,"Okay, disregarding the fact that I am a boot/bootie girl and firmly believe one can never have too many pairs, so my opinion is slightly biased to always be in favor of the boots, these are fabulous! The color is great, the fit is wonderful--I will elaborate on this--and the material is the PERFECT combination of firm but supple.<br />Seriously, these boots hold their shape SO well, but the material is soft enough that where the material does rub, it doesn't cause blisters (and my experience with most new boots in the same price range is that they do initially cause blisters).<br />Now, for the size, I wear an 8 in shoes any day of the week, but I've learned that ordering a size 9 in boots specifically just works well for me, because I tend to wear thick socks. These boots are no exception to this process. With thick ankle socks, they're perfectly comfortable, not tight, not overly loose. My feet don't slip or slide around inside, but my circulation also isn't being cut off.<br />I don't anticipate they'll last a long time, both because I'm rough on my shoes and because I just don't expect to get years of use from $32 boots/shoes, but I'm okay with that, and I'll just be pleasantly surprised if they do.<br />Totally worth the price tag for what you get as of right now!"
5.0,This is a durable well made fanny pack. Not too bad looking on either!
5.0,Love the design. Much too large. It appears to be fitted and a small looks and fits like a large!!
5.0,Excellent. Perfect  size
5.0,A very very nice wallet and very good quality. Plenty of room for everything.
5.0,"Amazing, you should buy it, very light soft and warm!"
5.0,Comfortable. Classy. Perfect fit. I'm 5'6&#34; and 128 pounds with a 32A bust and a small fits perfectly.
5.0,this cross is just beautiful!
5.0,"Soft, plush, warm, pink is bright and vivid, just enough color variation with the white. Nicely done. Ponytail hole is small, and location is accurately depicted."
5.0,"thank you, i love this jacket."
5.0,"I'm a size 16 and the top fit perfectly, but I think it is supposed to be a 1X so that's why I say it runs small.  The shaping is ultra flattering."
5.0,"Beautiful, I love it."
5.0,"These glasses are polarized light weight and very affordable, I would recommend 100%"
5.0,Excellent product thin enough to fit on watch with pins in place
5.0,Quality.
5.0,This is the perfect tank I have been looking for.  The fabric is cotton with spandex so it fits nicely.  They are good quality.  Regular scoop neck in front and back.  Perfect for layering.  I have bought almost all the colors for just in case they don't offer them anymore.
5.0,We live in Texas so I've used this many times. Keeps my head cool and relatively dry.
5.0,My teenage sons loved the way this product fit and I was happy with the level of protection
5.0,Was just what I was looking for. No green mark and is stamped with the 925 silver stamp.

5.0,Great!! Kids love
5.0,best quality and best price
5.0,This bag is amazingly soft and useful. Love all the pockets and the style.
5.0,These are so cool
5.0,"This is a great dress for the price!  The fabric is much thicker than expected, but that's okay since it means you can't see through it.  I usually wear a size 4 in dresses, but ordered a 6 based on other reviews, and I'm glad I did."
5.0,"My wedding is coming up in a month and I've been searching for the perfect head piece to go with my dress and this is absolutely it! It looks and feels very expensive, but is offered at an amazingly reasonable price. There's no reason so spend a fortune on your wedding accessories. Buy from this seller and spend the extra money you save on something else. This headpiece is extremely comfortable and stylish it will add the perfect touch. I am very impressed and so excited to wear it.<br />I recieved this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"Beautiful purse, especially the strap!! ‚ò∫‚ò∫üëçüëç"
5.0,"Just underwent a thyroid removal surgery and needed something to protect my scar from sun. Scarfs were proving too hot in summers and for the initial weeks when the scar was fresh, soft and non abrasive material of this scarf was very helpful. It is chic and fashionable accessory with multipurpose utility!"
5.0,Love love love.<br /><br />Light weight but professional
5.0,Reading
5.0,This is a great little cardigan. Fits true to size. Washes well!
5.0,"I bought this for my son's school project, they fit perfectly. It's very good quality. We got it very quick. good buy"
5.0,I love the design but the chest area has absolutely no support at all if you have a chest bigger than a ‚Äúb‚Äù it won‚Äôt work.  Colors are quite vibrant and the two tone design is so pretty. Generally love the dress
5.0,This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.Very pretty.
5.0,Held up great
5.0,I love this item!! It‚Äôs truly unique and well worth the money I paid. Extremely shiny and well constructed.
5.0,"My dog chewed up my friend's snapback on his hat, and I was able to fix it with just a needle and these.  So far they haven't broken (to my knowledge).  I would order these again for any hats that need the snapback plastic piece replaced."
5.0,Perfect size ! Fast delivery
5.0,These work great!
5.0,Beautiful dress! I surprised my daughter with it and she loves it. For the money you cant beat it.
5.0,It was exactly what I was looking for so that I could make some keychains for my women's group.
5.0,Beautiful dress quality fabric!!!
5.0,"Very comfortable, I use this for everything, from mowing to shopping"
5.0,"is very cropped, doesn‚Äôt feel cheap"
5.0,VERY NICE LEOPARD COLORS..
5.0,long enough to use as a pashmina or a sarong! warmer than you expect.
5.0,"The Liumilac blouse is comfortable and flattering.  The white is almost an ivory, not a bright white.  The fabric is soft and doesn‚Äôt cling.  I think of chiffon as being almost see thru, this is not.  The fabric has some weight to it.  I really like the smocked waist.  This would be just another button up if not for the fitted waist.  The length is long enough to cover my bottom and is slightly rounded.  The blouse is well made and the buttons secure.  The sleeves look slim in the pictures of the model, but they fit my large upper arms and the sleeves are not tight.  The sleeves are too long, but I have short arms, so all sleeves are too long on me.  I folded them up one turn and I will stitch them up so they stay put.  This is a pretty feminine blouse that can be worn with pencil skirts and slacks or jeans for a more casual look.<br />I normally wear a size Large.  The size chart recommended XL. If it had been a Large the front shoulder area would have been too tight.  There is plenty of room elsewhere.  The fitted waist makes it work.  I don‚Äôt like clothes that are too tight or restrictive.  For reference I am 5‚Äô 3‚Äù inches tall, 152 pounds, 41--31-41.  I hope you found this information helpful."
5.0,Very cute and the girl that will be receiving these are going to love them.
5.0,"Fast shipping.  Ordered five and they look exactly as I expected.  Using them to make gifts, so haven't worn them yet to test durability."
5.0,"Love this dress! It fits sooooooo good and look great, I probably could have gotten a Medium and been ok but the large fits nicely."
5.0,"I have different reading prescriptions in each eye, with 6 pairs of readers all over the house for different activities.  These are NOT attractive, but look actually a bit better than some of the other brands of these out there.  They are also expensive, but are well-made, and it is wonderful to spin the little dial and have 1 eye come in clear, then do the other one, and voila!  Sharp vision in both eyes!  I wonder if someone might try this for distance vision sometime in the future..  I wish I had bought them sooner."
5.0,"They‚Äôre really nice workout shirts. I am pleased with the shirts. They fit really nice across the chest and the back is not cut out too much to make them a string tank top, so the arms are really comfortable as well. The measurement guide is very true to fit. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù and 240lbs. and the XXL (US) fits nicely. I‚Äôve actually have made 3 purchases of these shirts. That‚Äôs how much I love them."
5.0,"My foot is not ""wide"" and not ""narrow"". This short boot is a great fit. Ready to wear. Broken in the first day. The heel step is quiet and has some give which makes it a ""walking"" boot."
5.0,"Great design, loved"
5.0,"This is a beautiful bag -- really distinctive looking, and even nicer in person than it looks online. I got this for a wedding. I ended up wearing a different colored dress so I couldn't use this bag with it, but I kept the bag anyway because it is so pretty."
5.0,"Very light, small and pretty."
5.0,Washes well and super comfy shirt! So many compliments!
5.0,"Very comfortable, love!"
5.0,"I bought this skirt for my family photos and it was perfect. After reading the reviews I decided to go with the XL, I‚Äôm usually in-between a M and L."
5.0,Can not go wrong at all for the price. I will only buy glasses from this seller/brand.
5.0,Good morning I received my beautiful red bird mask and I love them I love to look out the window and watch the red birds land in the trees thank you so much they‚Äôre perfect

5.0,nice comfy underwear but buy a size bigger they run a lil small
5.0,I absolutely love this!!! I‚Äôm waiting for another sale because I want one in every color!!!!
5.0,"These socks are actually cotton! Very happy about that, with just enough stretch to help them stay up instead of puddling in shoes. So far they've held up under repeated washings without losing that wonderful elasticity. A good weight for winter and hold up well under a lot of walking/standing/running. Feet stay warm and dry. Surprisingly very happy with this crew sock. Comfortable and sturdy for all-day wear."
5.0,"My father likes this watch. It has a big screen to show the time and date. The numbers are big and clear. Meanwhile, it is easy to set up alarm."
5.0,Loved my dress it fit me perfectly
5.0,I'm happy with the design and finish. This boot jack  works well for removing my tall riding boots. They grab well enough that I'm not worried about shinning myself with my heel while pulling my boots off ;).
5.0,Love this dress.  Fits perfect
5.0,"Nice quality, color is exactly as the picture and all accessories are accounted for and are of descent quality. Overall very nice!"
5.0,"I can see this being a great pair of pajamas for the warmer months. The top and shorts are stretchy, and the shorts have a drawstring on them. I normally wear XS for tops and S for pants/skirts, and am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 145 pounds. It feels quite airy and light, and definitely cooling. The material doesn‚Äôt seem to bother my sensitive skin, either. No complaints here! It‚Äôs a bit too cold to be wearing it now but once spring/summer hit, I cannot wait to wear it."
5.0,"The pink/black/electric-green are awesome, they're my favorite tennis shoes i've ever bought my daughter! lol"
5.0,They fit pretty well
5.0,I got this dress for my daughter to wear for fall pictures and Thanksgiving. Its adorable and she received so many compliments. It fit true to size (a bit loose but I believe thats the style of dress). I would buy again!
5.0,I love this necklace! Great price as well. Hands are a tad bigger than I expected but that might be a good thing for someone else. I love skulls & skeletons so this was a nice addition to my jewelry collection.
5.0,Perfect fit. Nice lightweight and durable material suitable for the Caribbean climate.  Great dress for work.
5.0,"Very soft and resistant to washing machine, good absorption, very good service, recommended. I already bought many, good quality."
5.0,awesome work out shirts
5.0,"Great quality for a great price. I highly recommend this leotard, it‚Äôs comfortable and aesthetically beautiful."
5.0,"I love the choker, but clasp broke very first time I wore it."
5.0,COVID-19 era must-have!!!  Perfect for holding mask at the ready in between meetings at work or in between stores on a shopping run.  Co-workers snagged all the extras from my first order so I bought a second pack to bring to the office.  Everyone loves them and have been buying them for their family members to use as well.
5.0,"These are my FAVORITE LEGGINGS EVERRRR!!!  I am on my way to get more. Soft, fits perfectly, suppper comfy.  Nothing more you can ask for."
5.0,"I have tried several eyeglass neckglasses to hold my glasses and this is by far the best one. Great price and great product.  Well constructed and nice looking. Hoping they sell others in the future with a brown leather band instead of only black, I would buy more for friends."
5.0,Looks great! Great quality! Very detailed bracelet.
5.0,They are so freaking cute. Love them
5.0,"great size, so lightweight."
5.0,The size chart was misleading if you follow it you will get shorts that are too big ( like I did). I returned one order and ordered my normal size and it was good.  These are lightweight and incredible soft. I love that a women‚Äôs short actually has real pockets! I have only worn them once as our weather turned cold here again. Looking forward to having these shorts this sumner
5.0,I love this watch.  I wear it almost every day.  It keeps accurate time and it looks great.  I have gotten many compliments and people asking where I got it.  My only complaint is that the post under the clasp broke off after about a month.  It doesn't affect the clasp and the watch has never unlatched or fallen off.  I would definitely purchase this again!
5.0,"This is a very nice baby hat, it‚Äôs soft and warm , well made..."
5.0,"I normally get smalls but I got a medium for this and it fit perfect! I would suggest to size up, other than that I loved it and got so many compliments!!"
5.0,"I was mad at myself in the casino when I had spent the budget money that I had brought with me to gamble and had $300 that I had won earlier tucked away in the Winners Bank that I wanted to access but when I arrived home and opened  up the Bank I was feeling like a winner for a change. Nice to have, it takes away temptation that you might regret later."
5.0,"Very pretty necklace, bought for my daughter. She loves it"
5.0,"Got a photo if my son in this. So detailed and amazing truly. Have it on my keys for work daily. Dropped numerous times, my 18month old plays with it, and it‚Äôs still running strong on its first battery since Christmas. Great item to buy!"
5.0,This shirt is SO CUTE! I ordered a size up and glad I did! It looks as pictured & will shrink a bit when drying.
5.0,I love this piece. The chain length allows the pendant to have a perfect position for display. I am hoping the finish will outlast many wearings.
5.0,Good quality and fit well
5.0,"Design is really nice, this is a good-looking watch, comfortable to wear, lightweight, you forget that you have on. The luminous hands are added bonus. Overall, this is a great looking watch and a good value"

5.0,Boys love playing with the lights
5.0,Super cute. Easy to breathe in

5.0,I loved how this dress fit. It was very flattering on my and hid my fupa well. I would buy again in another color.
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous, beautiful, weighty.  I LOVE it!"
5.0,C√≥moda y suave
5.0,Super cute and alittle oversized. Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,Comfortable and easily replaced the existing strap.
5.0,"I use my glasses mainly for driving. I have designer sun glasses that cost nearly 8x as much as these Duduma and they are not as comfortable and not as effective at improving visibility in bright sunlight. One thing I've noticed about these glasses is that they not only reduce the amount of bright sunlight, but they make things brighter. I know that sounds contradictory, but I guess the polarizing effects of the glasses cuts glare which makes the visual field brighter. The polarized lenses block out the light without blinding you with dark lenses. If you have never had polarized lenses you will just have to try them on see for yourself. Amazing sunglasses! You can't beat the price. I realize that everyone has different head size/facial contours, so the glasses may not fit as well on someone else. My son even wears these though and he loves them..hes 11..so they fit a pretty wide range of head sizes.... I think they are made to fit most heads comfortably, but if your head is extra large or extra small, you may want to purchase from a source where you can try it on before you buy. When I walk into a store I put my sunglasses on the top of my head and then pull them down again when I go out. This procedure doesn't seem to have &#34;stretched out&#34; the frames. They still fit perfectly. They have stood up well and perform as you would expect. The lenses have not scratched yet and are great at blocking glare. I can highly recommend these shades if you are in the market for a full frame pair of polarized glasses. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!! I received a sample product to test and evaluate and give my unbiased feedback to you. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review."
5.0,"I ordered this for a 2 week trip and took along another purse, just in case I wanted to trade them .  This one was perfect and I never used the other one.  It's lightweight, goes easily across the neck and shoulders.  It has 2 zippered pockets outside, plus 2 open pockets, and one zippered pocket inside.  It was roomy enough to throw in my glasses case, a couple of card holders, a cosmetic case, etc.  It had more than enough room for everything needed in your bag. It was the right choice for our trip and I'm still using it (instead of my heavier Coach bags)."
5.0,Fit well. Very cute on!
5.0,"These are so comfortable!  Love the ease of just sliding them on and the wedge style.  I'm normally a 7.5 or 8 and ordered the Small, they fit perfectly.  I have gotten many compliments and have been wearing them daily!"
5.0,I love this shirt. I wish I could wear it all year long üò≠
5.0,My son loves this pen.

5.0,Nice quality and pretty colors.
5.0,Perfect fit with relatively good quality
5.0,"I bought these rhinestone straps to add a little extra bling to both casual clothes or evening wear.  They are especially cute with tunics that exposes one or both shoulders.  I really like the adjustment feature except that the lobster clasp seemed to be on the wrong end of the chain to me.  When used, the adjustment creates a loop in the extension chain that is several inches up from the bra strap.  So, being handy with jewelry-making tools, I moved the lobster clasp to the end of the chain right next to the hook so it can be tucked behind the bra band to camouflage the adjustment, especially for totally strapless styles.  This worked wonderfully.  I've included pics of the front attachment, the back attachment after I moved the clasp and the adjustment chain tucked behind the bra band.  With that minor change, I am 100% pleased with this purchase.  These come with a storage box and tarnish remover cloth.  A few things to note: 1) these straps have no stretch at all, so keep this in mind when adjusting the tension in the straps.  Start by making the rhinestone strap the same length as the original strap.  Then adjust link-by-link as needed. 2) Don't spray perfume, body glitter or anything else onto the straps because it can cause the silver metal to turn and the crystals to turn black, ruining the bling factor.  3) After wearing, wipe the straps clean, allow to dry thoroughly and store in a plastic bag to protect them from airborne particles.  Very nice purchase for a great price.  Highly recommend."
5.0,"I love the dress, the feel, the flow, the comfort."
5.0,The top is thin and cooling which is great for my 13 month old daughter who runs very warm. the ripped jean shorts are TOO CUTE! Went through the regular wash with no problems or changes.

5.0,Color saturated throughout stone<br />Lightweight for crafts projects
5.0,My granddaughter loved it so I guess it was perfect!  She opened the present and from that moment forward she did not remove it for the rest of the evening. Doesn‚Äôt get much better than that when you‚Äôre talking about a 10 year old!

5.0,My wife loved it and so did i
5.0,"This is a very fun garment. Firstly, it came in a pretty bag that could certainly be reused for little trinkets. Makeup, jewelry, etc. It's very sheer and the material is soft and comfortable.  The print is beautiful, sort of a cross between paisly and an indian print. I would even wear it over jeans with a t-shirt of tank top under it. Use your imagination! I'm 5'7&#34; and the longest part comes to my knees. I'm looking forward to wearing it poolside, whenever the weather might warm up here.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I have received a discount on this product in exchange for a review."
5.0,Love it--it&#34;s beautiful!
5.0,I am happy with the look and quality of the necklace.  It has a unique design and looks just like the picture in the online description. It comes in a nice box and would make an attractive gift.
5.0,Love the color! Love the fit! Comfy and soft!
5.0,Fits great. I'm 6'3&#34;. 300.  Not to big. Not tight when I sit
5.0,I hosted a bridal shower with a Beauty and the Beast theme. The apron was for one of the games. It arrived earlier than promised and was perfectly cute.
5.0,"I really love this dress. Instead of white dots over the top, you get silver spots. But it‚Äôs still so pretty. I thought it would be too small, but it wasn‚Äôt: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and about 140. I got the Large. It‚Äôs light weight and flowy. I will definitely keep this for formal events!"
5.0,"Was looking for something pastel and fun, and this met my requirements. Well made."
5.0,"These socks are great!  Not too thick or too thin, perfectly sized and themed for the young dare devils!"
5.0,"I have a shaved....but large head. I figured the bigger size would fit best. Because theband has some stretch, Iit wound up fitting bigger than I expected. I'm going to order the black cap but in the smaller size, and hope it fits comfortably."
5.0,Great. Got for my mother as a gift . great quality and looks expensive
5.0,Good quality just maybe a tad small but wearable. Quick delivery
5.0,This owl bag is perfect.
5.0,This is a cute crushed velvet hat that is adjustable in the back which has a large brim which is great at shadowing your face. It's perfect for wearing in the summer to provide shade/sun protection for your face while being a bit stylish at the same time. It's comfortable and cute as well.
5.0,My 11 year old daughter got the size 5 and it's perfect for her as it has a little room so that she does not out grow it quickly.
5.0,Looks even better than in photo.  Many compliments.  Clips hold it securely.
5.0,Love the pockets and the rich color. Washed well and held its shape. Would recommend. The cotton is thick and not flimsy.

5.0,"Soft, stylish, comfortable, and you don't look like your Grandmother in it! I LOVE IT! I will be buying in other colors!"
5.0,Love the color in these fun earrings
5.0,Shirt fit as expected
5.0,This dress was amazing! It's soft and clingy and the stretchy material the laces are made of is incredibly high quality and honestly the best part. The slit was a little hard to see unless I deliberately put my leg out but I'm pretty sure that's just my body.
5.0,So soft. Granddaughters love them for the added cover for their necks without the worry of being bulky.
5.0,"The quality is great, but the shorts were a tad bit tighter than I'd like. I knew this going in cause I do have bigger hips. No complaints here. The shirt was perfect though."
5.0,This necklace is gorgeous and you can't beat the price!
5.0,"When I took them out of the package I thought,  no way,  they look too small.  Then I tried them on and they fit perfectly and are very, very soft.  I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 190.  I ordered a 3XL.  Delivery was super fast.  Thanks...I will enjoy!!!!"
5.0,"bought it for a practice dress. Have not used it yet, but fits as expected and arrived quickly."
5.0,Runs a little small. But that's OK. I've lost weight & that's why I needed it.
5.0,Love how this looks! It‚Äôs pretty comfortable too. The straps weren‚Äôt too tight or too loose which is so hard to find! I got a medium and it almost fits perfect. It could be a little more snug but it doesn‚Äôt move around or hang off or anything like that.
5.0,Perfect spring dress!
5.0,"It cleanses silver, gold AND stainless steel. The two different clothes make the job easy and it really cleans. Directions in English and Spanish (should you need them‚Ä¶)."
5.0,Love the fit ... Over the years I have purchase Breezies bras. The jacquard lace bras are pretty in detail. Lasting and very comfortable product.
5.0,"Bought tow of these for Father's Day, one for my father and the other for my in-law. It was a hit! They both loved their watch and it looks great."
5.0,"This maxi shirt dress is so beautiful.  It does run small so make sure you order about a size larger than you would normally wear.  The maxi is also somewhat sheer.  I have a black cotton slip that I put under it, and it is gorgeous.  The original dress that I ordered was too small, so I returned it and ordered a size larger.  Blooming Jelly was a pleasure to work with and were quick in their response and solving my issue."
5.0,"Great statement necklace! Definitely don‚Äôt have to worry about seeing others rock this while you‚Äôre out. Pretty light-weight, not too heavy. Great value for the money too. Mine arrived well packaged in one piece. I love it!"
5.0,Perfect for my cosplay!  Light material was perfect for the hot day! Brighter blue than expected but gorgeous nonetheless!
5.0,I bought a lot of costumes from Amazon for my job. This one was the funniest and the easiest to wear. It's a little hard to slip on if you're big. And make sure you order a size up. And it's a little toasty in hot weather. But it's easy to wear and really funny
5.0,Love this dress. Casual to wear out and about but also dressy enough to wear to work at the office for the day.
5.0,Perfect for a night out!
5.0,Really nice quality. I‚Äôm using them for wedding corsages. All the pieces came with gems set properly.
5.0,fine!
5.0,"Love how large the shades are, light on the face,  and blue tint is gorgeous!"
5.0,Awesome deal.
5.0,"Even though it's rough wearing these in 100 degree+ California weather, the fit is true to size and the swelling in my foot stayed under control. Just the right amount of compression. I'll be purchasing more."
5.0,These socks are very stylish and comfortable and great for when you want something to line your shoes.
5.0,This is my most favorite shoe ever!!! But it‚Äôs discontinued so I had to overpay to get them!!!!!
5.0,Its thinner material than we expected. Like a thin tee shirt. But nice and comfy.
5.0,Perfect for Prom. Great quality just what we were looking for
5.0,"A little scratchy but looks very nice wore it to a wedding . The black one it added a bit of dress up to a formal occasion without being gaudy . Price was nice , you get 3 different colors ."
5.0,"Love love love this, the print, the fabric, all of it! Looks adorable on my granddaughter!!"
5.0,They fit perfect and don't slide down. They're breathable and very slimming
5.0,Grandson loved them. Mom loved how easy they were to clean.
5.0,"I ordered the size LARGE based upon reviews in the color BLACK. I am 5ft tall and about 115lbs and wear between small and medium. I highly recommend sizing UP. Fit without being too tight. Comfortable for working out even when utilizing the pockets. I've run at least 2 miles (in one shot) wearing these And no issues with items shifting out of the pocket. Just as super easy to retrieve my phone from the pocket while tracking runs to check my time, distance or change up songs mid-movement. Color is great and not see-through. Price is nice! Will buy more of these."
5.0,Nice Shirt!.  Bought two and gave one away as a door prize at my Bourbon Tasting event in Louisville!
5.0,Percect thing 1 thing 2 costume attire

5.0,Gorgeous. Well worth the purchase. More pics and updates through out this year. My girlfriend is going to love this. Shipped & delivered rite on time of course with prime. Just got today 02-26-18.
5.0,"Got these for my granddaughter and they are adorable. VERY soft. She loved them bc they were cute, even tho they are masks. Good fit too. Xtra protection w multi layers made me happy. Who knows what REALLY works but I feel better so...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
5.0,Great gloves- lightweight and protect hands well no matter what the sharp object you are dealing with. Got some for all the family
5.0,I love the way it fits so nice
5.0,What I liked the most was the hungry dogs won the super bowl!! Go Eagles!!<br />The mask worked perfect to help celebrate our win.
5.0,Bought these for a pair of toddler shoes in which the laces it came with were not long enough. These are perfect for a wiggly toddler that barely holds still long enough to put a shoe on let alone tie the laces.  I bought both a small and a medium so that I will have a pair when his feet get bigger. GENUIS!!!
5.0,AAA+
5.0,"Very pretty, great price."
5.0,"Beautiful, my family loved it."
5.0,"Though the cold winter nights are just about over, I will definitely be using these when it gets cold again!  I have bigger hands and longer fingers so I ordered the large and though it takes a few pulls to get them on, they stretch a bit so they fit very well.  Very soft inside and the stitching is strong.  These are now the nicest gloves I own.  I tried using them to play a game on my phone and I had no problems whatsoever.  I didn't even need to press my finger, just the tip of the glove and it worked!  And I always have to take my gloves off to answer or play on my phone so next winter I will not have to worry about that.  As you can see in the picture, they go almost all the way down on the fingers but with the stretch they have I had no problem moving my fingers around.  I always have a problem with that with every other glove I have or have tried on.  So I can say I highly recommend these winter gloves!<br />Disclosure:  I received these gloves for free for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"I order a small for my 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 92-pound mother and they were so small they looked like a child's size.<br /><br />I then bought her a large, which should‚Äôve swallowed her, but they fit as long as they don't shrink after being washed.<br /><br />My mom is super tiny, the fact that a large barely fits should let everyone know to order up 2-3 sizes, if not more."
5.0,"My granddaughter loved these.  They are cotton, well made and received on time. Would definitely recommend to a friend."
5.0,Very flattering and soft maternity.
5.0,"Needed a long, warm coat for casual wear - around the fire pit, etc. and am very happy with this coat.  It is not super heavy but is very warm, and I love the length and the hood (I didn't think I would like the hood,  but it fits really well and blocks the wind on my neck and around my face). As others have noted - it was extremely wrinkled.  Tried to de-wrinkle in the dryer and it didn't help much.  Will either dig out the steamer or take to dry cleaners.  But a minor issue for me since the coat really fits my needs.  I normally wear 8-10 size in ladies and ordered large which is perfect over winter clothes."
5.0,"Fit as expected, comfortably to wear."
5.0,"Received the item as a discount for a review.  I liked the item, mainly because it was light weight and comfortable on the face.  I was a bit concerned if they would fit differently, but surprisingly it was well fitted.  The ease of material shaped to fit my face, and was not uncomfortable.  The item arrived as described, and I plan to purchase additional ones for my family."
5.0,These are so comfortable and soft. Perfect fit too.
5.0,so cute! nice addition to granddaughters gift of lalaloopsy dolls sat shipping
5.0,"This is a soft cottony, fully adjustable, perfectly fitting crop top. The straps are a dream. They‚Äôre more tube-like than laces-like, so they don‚Äôt cut into my skin, and remain comfortable, no matter how tightly I tie them. I‚Äôve already ordered a second just to be sure I have another once this one is worn out. (I tend to wear these type adjustable tops instead of bralettes, etc for a multitude of reasons which I‚Äôm sure other motherhood-induced-flatter-chested ladies can understand.) I wish there was a white option. Any lighter color options would be fabulous, but the standard black is fabulous as well.<br />As a person who suffers extreme side-boob in other tops, I can assure you that since it‚Äôs fully adjustable, buying a size up will solve any problem one might have in that area. Intend to add photos at some point for reference."
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. True to picture color. Washed it twice hasn't lost its color or shrunk.
5.0,It‚Äôs a nice ring at a decent price. I‚Äôm happy with the purchase.
5.0,"I love my aurora borealis statement necklace and earring set. You can use it for special occasions, or wear it with denim; so you can have a denim and diamonds day. Lol! Really the set is beautiful, and every woman needs a bling day. I highly recommend this set."
5.0,"Cute print, the detail in the back gives it shape.  Gift for a friend, she loved it."
5.0,Love it got it right before the practice race tonight !!
5.0,Like!!!
5.0,"Pretty earrings! I have a cartilege piercing in side of my ear and some earrings hurt when sleeping. This one is perfect depth.<br /><br />However, the nearly microscopic screw beadball I could not use. I found a bigger one from another earring that was easier to use. That is only thing that could be improved upon."
5.0,Love my Goonies shirt!  One of my favorite movies and I am 57..LOL
5.0,"Its so so cute! I wore it with a t-shirt and jeans and it looked adorable! It is a little longer than I thought, but super cute"
5.0,"I have been using this jersey for about a month.  The quality is excellent, and the fit for a Large is as expected since I have normally worn large size jerseys for years.  This is quite colorful, which is what I was wanting for visibility on the road. Full zip is a plus. The half sleeves come down over the biceps and have grippers to keep from creeping up. This makes them comfortable, although the tan lines will be lower than usual.  It is a cool fabric for summer use, but doesn't seem flimsy. A great value; I may buy another."
5.0,A little large!
5.0,"Very nice!! My wife has small hands and these fit perfectly. She's had them for 3months now and have been worn very close to daily on our Homestead here in New England for all the chores that come with having pigs, cows, and 4 types of poultry. They are holding up much better than expected. For someone with small hands these are the perfect glove/mittens we've found"
5.0,My girlfriend loved it! She wears it all the time!
5.0,Even nicer than picture!  Would recommend. Made nice Christening gift
5.0,"First impressions, Fantastic quality for twentyfive bucks. Smells like China..."
5.0,HAVEN'T USED IT BUT I IT WAS AS EXPECTED
5.0,I bought this for my daughter to wear to her fifth birthday Princesses and Princes party. The dress is a gorgeous shade of yellow with small crimson red flower details and a puffy netting underneath that gives it just enough umpf. It is shin length for my especially tall 5 year old. It may be longish for anyone else. It is so durable (haven't washed it yet). I highly recommend this unique princess or fairy style dress.
5.0,I am absolutely in love with this product. I was concerned that the lining would make this boot extremely hot and/or uncomfortable. That was not the case. I would purchase them in every color. #UGGLove
5.0,This was so cute!!  Bought as a present for a 9 year old and she loved it
5.0,Bought watch for my brother‚Äôs 24th birthday. He loved it and was so excited to wear it. Unfortunately the watch is too large for his wrist. The package only can with this small silver meter adjuster and i‚Äôm unsure how to resize it. I believe I am missing the resize tool used for this band. I have a silver band with links. Looking at the manual i believe this tools is only used for the mesh band I need the additional tool in order to adjust the watch.
5.0,Love this purse and matching wallet. So cute!!
5.0,"Perfect, we made it into a Christmas ornament to remember the occasion."
5.0,My don in law was very pleased with his gift. He says it is a perfect fit and very warm.
5.0,"The original band for my watch broke so I ordered this one. I was a bit hesitant about the magnet holding the band secure but it does a great job. I have never had the magnet slip and it stays where I put it. It is very comfortable and the color is nearly identical to the color of my watch. Attaching it was super simple, it snapped right in place after removing the old one. I've been wearing it everyday since and love it. So much better than the original one that came with the watch. Highly recommend it."
5.0,"Love the feel, the price. I will be ordering another pair."
5.0,Comfortable!! Perfect for lounging around or running errands
5.0,I purchased it for my 16 years daughter. The dress is looking perfectly. There is nice quality of material
5.0,Requested more for Christmas because have come to love them. They fit great and the &#34;grips&#34; work perfectly. No sliding or slipping. The grips on mine lasted about 5-6 months of weekly wear / washing before started losing bits of of them. Also breath so feet don't get too hot. Still work great and would def buy again.
5.0,Loved it. Bought two because I gave my first one away to my frat brother!
5.0,"I love this dress. It‚Äôs soft and light. It also has a zipper on the side which was nice. The straps are adjustable which is a big plus.<br /><br />And If it helps:<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1, and roughly 160 lbs, I normally wear a size 10/12 and ordered the large and it fit comfortably but was still flattering (I‚Äôm a pear shape)."
5.0,"Sturdy, yet relaxed fit. I like it. The additions to the belt are nice as well. Very functional."
5.0,Perfect for playing Mrs Peacock ar our local community theatre. The musical CLUE.  So pretty
5.0,"What do I feel? I'm a Russian speaking solider somewhere in Afghanistan. I waste my useless life manning a checkpost on the road to Lamar Khaate palace. Ive hid diamonds in my nether regions. As I walk around in a specific circular path, I know that at any second, the dude who attaches flying balloons will show up. It has happened multiple times in the past. Thankfully I'm no specialist. Just some dude in the Soviet army. I'm grateful that the dude just CQCs me, rather than using a ""sends-them-flying"" shotgun in my face. We've been told to wear this hat, whenever the dude (supposedly called Big Boss) appears."
5.0,My grandson put these on and never took them off. No blisters after walking all day at amusement park several days in a row.
5.0,"So cute in person! Very reflective very mirrored, if that's what you're going for. Sturdy and solid frame!"
5.0,I bought these for my granddaughter. She loved them.
5.0,"Love the material. For me, the best fit in this style is one size smaller than I usually wear. It is easy to launder and great selection. Thank you."
5.0,"My sixteen year old daughter just loves this sweater,, Azetec is in now and this is comfortable and the color is light and lovely."
5.0,"my husband really likes the quality,wish the buckle would stay in place better"
5.0,"I had to get a sportier band for my apple watch because I was going to be in the water (pool, ocean) a lot, but I didn't want to spend a lot since I didn't plan on wearing it beyond those water days. I wore the wine band for 9 days straight (taking it off at night to charge), and it held up nicely. I knew I would overstay my sun exposure and get sunburned, and the watch tan line isn't so bad due to the thin band. I just might keep the band on a little longer because it was really comfortable. I would definitely recommend this 2-pack."
5.0,Beautiful suit! Perfect combination of sexy and demure. I'm 5'5&#34; 135lbs and 34B. Medium fits nicely.
5.0,My husband works in lawn care and he was looking for a ring to wear on the job. These have worked perfectly.
5.0,Our kids lose sunglasses constantly!  Great deal and nice assorted color options.  They run slightly large for my 3 & 4 year old but still stay on their faces for the most part.
5.0,"Bought these on a whim just to give the look a try. I'm still not sure if heart shaped glasses are childish or not, but I feel like the fact that they're black makes them more chic and 'adult' like.<br /><br />The plastic is sturdy and the frame is oversized which works well for my face shape.<br /><br />Overall, I think they are well worth the money."
5.0,"My daughter wore these glasses for a school project. These glasses fit perfectly for her face. Her project was two months ago, she still likes to wear the glasses."
5.0,My son used this a camp and he said it fit great.  I had it in two days which was fast!
5.0,My granddaughter can‚Äôt get enough of these boots!  This is the second pair we have bought her as she grew out of the first pair. She calls them her comfy shoes and won‚Äôt wear anything else. Great quality at a great price!!
5.0,Loved both colors! Great quality for the price!
5.0,YET ANOTHER HIT WITH PORCELAIN LOOKING DOLL LIKE LOOK AROUND YOUR NECK. I'M SO PLEASED I'M BUYING THE ENTIRE COLLECTION FOR MY CUSTOMERS AND THEN FOR MYSELF.TO GIVE AS GIFTS THEN FOR MY JEWELRY BOX. ONLY THIS VENDOR HAS THEM &#34;& TEY ARE WONDERFUL TO DEAL WITH.
5.0,Received this as a Christmas gift for my brother since I am a big Superman fan I absolutely love it I got the gold version I just hope the color holds up!
5.0,I love this dress. It fits great
5.0,Great Product and
5.0,Amazing! Exactly what i needed and great quality!
5.0,They fit very comfertable and my daughter loves them.
5.0,"These are the best face covering I've come across. Nice and thick, good quality. Highly recommended!!!"
5.0,This dress is perfect! I checked my measurements before ordering and could not have asked for a more perfect fit. Great quality at a great price.
5.0,Great bags. Not too small or big. Nice designs and can hold a lot of items. Fits nice and compact  in my crossbody bag. Handles are long enough to put over shoulder. Would buy again.
5.0,Beautiful dress. She looks perfect in it. I love that it is 3 separate pieces that way i can put the flower and the sash where i want them!
5.0,Very very nice looks great.
5.0,"Everything was as expected. Fit, style, fabric perfect love these shorts. So comfortable."
5.0,I always get compliments on this watch band.
5.0,"I love this dress, it's very flattering. It does get wrinkles when you sit. Other than the wrinkles it's my favorite casual dress."
5.0,Its beautiful and heavy. I love it.
5.0,they were perfect
5.0,It is worthy of any Klaus
5.0,"It's made of quality fabric, nice and fashionable design, comfortable to wear, it doesn't Fogged if you wear eye glasses."
5.0,Love this dress. Well made. True to size.
5.0,Quick ship wonderful quality!
5.0,Love it! Wear it all the time!
5.0,great fit and very comfortable flip flops.
5.0,"There is nothing to dislike about them, self adjustable, beautiful to start a collection and the price is great. I wear mine 24 hrs. a day I never take them off"
5.0,"These socks are hilariously awesome (like I am according to the socks)! Sure they're men's socks but why should they get all the fun?  I got a s/m for my size 7.5 foot and they fit great. Good quality,  bright color, perfect saying. My trainer asks me every time where my socks are now! Highly recommended!"
5.0,very cute fits perfect an shipped fast THANK YU
5.0,Perfect hat. I wear it all the time.
5.0,We love this boot and so does my grandson !
5.0,"I own a bunch of G-Shocks, and the DW-290, but at the end of the day, the F-91W wins out. Nothing comes close in terms of lightness, comfort, and reliability, and this version is no different.<br />I don't know if this has been mentioned by many reviewers, but I just wanted to point out a few small differences between this olive green model and the original black one:<br />1) For whatever reason, the strap on this one is just a hair shorter (see photo).<br />2) The LCD screen of the green model is *slightly* worse than that of the original - text is less sharp/clear.<br />3) As the band on the green model is slightly shorter, the spacing between the holes is slightly different - meaning the two watches will not fit exactly the same.<br /><br />That said, none of these are dealbreakers in any way; the green is faintly metallic (almost has a glitter sheen to it), and looks great, and the functionality and performance are identical to the original. Well worth the money!"
5.0,This precious night gown is a birthday gift for my great niece. I was thrilled with the fabric and quality and was proud to give as a gift.
5.0,Awesome sunglasses.
5.0,This dress is AMAZING! Great quality! Ordered 110 for my daughter's 4th birthday. In the US she wears a xsmall or 5/6.
5.0,Perfect work shirt conversation starter
5.0,Love these shades bu sungait. I was torn between these and pair by Columbia. Great reviews for these won me over. They are marked gender neutral but I find the width a bit wide for female faces. They come with a portable screwdriver to adjust fit and the clarity of the lens is amazing. They do appear very dark from the outside but polarization makes them clear in any light.  Very comfortable sturdy frame. Wish they came in brown or other bright colors.
5.0,"Nice fit, gorgeous"
5.0,The first masks that fit our four year olds appropriately!
5.0,"Ordered 20inch Chain first and it was too short for my husband, so I ordered the 24<br /> inch and he is delighted with the look and feel of the chain. It's beautiful with the medallion I got to go with it. He is very pleased with the look. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a beautiful chain that is masculine enough to look good on a man yet dainty enough to look beautiful on a woman"
5.0,Love the fit and how soft the shirt is. The shoulders are slightly puffy but it really does make it look nice
5.0,love it. wish there were more just like it with similar appropriate sayings.
5.0,Nice material. I like the fact that it's not see through.
5.0,Great quality and very cute.
5.0,These are beautiful well made bracelets.  Great value for the price!
5.0,"I bought this as a gift,my sister loves it!!"
5.0,Great amount and quality for the price!
5.0,"Great color, fits comfortably not too tight"
5.0,There is a problem with wand that is suppose to have batteries with it .  I bought two .  They must be special kind as it does not look like a std battery size when you open it .  It‚Äôs suppose to light up and make sound .  Can I get them sent to me ?
5.0,"So comfy & cute. I love them, they are what I expected."
5.0,love these glasses.  great fot over my prescription.  cuts glare .  do not have to take them off ever.
5.0,My daughter looks so cute in these sandals!
5.0,My son loves these shoes!
5.0,"Adorable pattern, super soft, and my son loves it! Just wish it came in a little bit bigger sizes so we could hang onto it longer."
5.0,Love these earrings!! They were just as pictured. Great quality!!
5.0,looks good and stretches for comfort
5.0,"Seldom do I buy from TV advertising, having been burned a few times.  However, these socks, as seen on  TV, have exceeded my expectations. Michigan has endured a cold winter with sustained below zero nights and even days.  For shoveling, sweeping, and clearing snow, I can keep my feet warm.  As a senior citizen, I consider warm feet an important health component.  The socks seem to work better when I warm them by our fireside before heading outdoors.  And even another benefit is that the socks are support hose, another plus for seniors.  I definitely recommend this product and have already told friends about the socks.j  Not sure they're good for an actual -35 temperature.  Having lived in Montana, I know what 40 below feels like, but the socks are excellent for my use here in Michigan."
5.0,Love!!!!!
5.0,I love these!
5.0,This was so perfect. It is exactly what I needed!
5.0,I got this as a gift for a couple. Excellent and classy watches!
5.0,it is very good product .
5.0,"Loved this dress and fit great. The detailing in the sleeves is beautiful, although they were a little loose. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the layer under the lace was a little shorter on the bottom by my ankles(shown in second picture)"
5.0,My granddaughter loved the glasses.
5.0,just a tad big. But she‚Äôll grow into them. She lives
5.0,Love the natural fiber and the fit is perfect
5.0,Est√°n muy bien para mi hija de 8 a√±os le encantaron
5.0,ES  UN  REGALO  PARA  MI  AMIGO Y  LE  GUSTO  MUCHO
5.0,Cool collection
5.0,"Material is heavier than I expected being it's 70% polyester, and it fits a little large, but I'm happy with the product"
5.0,I got the orange set and I am very pleased to say that it mimics the pictures! It‚Äôs a nice dusty pastel orange shade. The material feels like it will last for a long time. A lot of my yoga sets from Alo and lulu take a bit of maneuvering to get into but I just slide right into these. They are tight in the right places and I feel supported when doing light to medium yoga in them. I wouldn‚Äôt do cardio in these though since the bra doesn‚Äôt have as much support as a sports bra does!
5.0,It was somewhat small and I went two sizes up from what I normally wear but overall love the quality price and awesome shipping . Overall am a satisfied customer and will make this work
5.0,"Used for a custume for an active little boy, wings took the abuse and are still flying strong"
5.0,Very nice quality dress!
5.0,"Exactly as described, fast shipping, thanks!!"
5.0,"I like the breakaway fastener in the back. I had one of my keys that I use it for get stuck between the bars on a grocery cart, and instead of strangling me, it snapped apart as it‚Äôs supposed to. It snapped back together just as readily. Good product. Suitable for an ID, or I use mine as an around-the-neck keychain. Has a snap-off key ring and ID clip. Good way to show your Yankee pride!"
5.0,"I you're a fan of ""Better Call Saul,"" you need this shirt. I've gotten lots of comments asking whether U of Amer. Samoa is a real school, or what year I graduated!  Lol"
5.0,The material wasnt quite what i was looking for.
5.0,I‚Äôve tried almost every 9‚Äù brief out there and this without any doubt is the best.
5.0,Just got it. Bought it to tie down ice chest during flight.  It fits the ice chest and seems to be easy to use.
5.0,This skirt is honestly the most versatile and wonderful product. Own it in three patterns and have recommended it to countless friends.
5.0,My absolute favorite workout clothing item! Very flattering fit.
5.0,Love this dress. Great quality and the shipping was fast. I am 5'2&#34; and 135 lbs and I ordered a Medium. The length was a lil below the knee. The dress fit me perfectly.<br />I definitely will be ordering from this buyer again. Thank you so much
5.0,These hold tons of groceries....well worth the buy.
5.0,I Love them
5.0,"Good fit, typical inexpensive earrings."
5.0,I wear this so much around the house.  Looks super cute over a tank top with jeans
5.0,My mother loves these. She said there were the perfect length and the beads didn‚Äôt cut into her skin. The sides you slide your glasses arms into were nice and tight and her glasses stayed on well as she worked! And they looked great and went with everything:-)
5.0,Nice and soft and not thick. Happy with purchase.
5.0,My new favorites!
5.0,The quality comfort and fit are great for the price. I ordered 5 pairs different colors for work. I was very much pleased with everything about these pants
5.0,Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. They are super soft and cuddly.
5.0,I wear a small med normally but I needed a large in this dress. Pulls a little tight in the back. Im 5‚Äô2 118lbs. It is a darling dress! I reordered the dress from med to large and unfortunately UPS delivered it to wrong address and no one in our neighborhood contacted me that they got it. Well Amazon refunded the dress and sent me another one!!!!!! Thank you!!!! I love Amazon for sureüòä
5.0,It was an xl and it fit between a large and medium
5.0,Haven't put it to the winter weather test yet but it seems very well made and very warm.
5.0,very attractive...holds all my necklaces and bracelets without them getting tangled
5.0,Super adorable! Definitely worth the money!!
5.0,Very comfortable pack. Range finder pouch has 4 elastic bullet sleeves. Nice addition. Side pouch was perfect for my Havalon knife and zippered rear pouch was a nice spot for hand warmers. Love this pack!
5.0,Thank You A++++
5.0,"Such a great ring! My husband is active duty military and very athletic. His original wedding ring is titanium, and he requested a silicon ring so he doesn't have to take his ring on and off frequently and risk losing it, again! I shopped around and chose Keep Fit's black geometric ring. Now, I have not had any experience with silicon rings, so I was not sure how they were supposed to fit, nor did I know if it would fit true to size. The size I ordered was a 12, because admittedly, we couldn't remember if he was an 11 or 12. The ring came in a nice little square cardboard box. It has info on how to register your ring too. It's very soft, softer than I was expecting. Also more flexible than what I was thinking. The geometric pattern is so unique, yet masculine still. The edges are nice and smooth and it's just a really well made ring. My husband tried it on and it fit with some room to twist it around. After wearing it for a while, he said it felt like nothing and he totally forgot he was even wearing it. The next day he really put it to the test and went and lifted weights. He said there was no pinch, and it still didn't feel like he was wearing a ring. He loves it and I love that I found a great silicon ring for him! He leaves for deployment soon and he will be able to wear it there too! This would make an amazing gift for any man or woman who lives an active lifestyle. I truly feel this is made to last!"
5.0,Perfect fit! Will buy again and again.
5.0,Very nice shirt. Exactly what I wanted. Delivered on time. Very satisfied with manufacture and design of shirt. Will probably order more.
5.0,I love both the design and quality of these earrings.  The Abalone set against the silver is striking.  The fit well too.
5.0,"This necklace is a great value. The pendant has some weight to it and looks beautiful. The chain is okay - about what you'd expect for the cost. I gave this to my new stepdaughter as a gift during my wedding ceremony, and she also loved it."
5.0,So comfy and warm.  I love Lands End products.  Always high quality!
5.0,"Love, love..great material and much better in person"
5.0,"These little bags are great not only for eyeglasses but many other things as well. I put my sunglasses in one so they don't get scratched in the little car drop down box (it doesn't let them rattle up there either, nothing like rocking out to your favorite song and hearing your sunglasses vibrate at you head). I've put mine and my husband's protective work glasses in them, cell phones, and jewelry. I'm sure I or you can find many many more useful things to store in these bags and for the price....better than many store bought prices. So give then a try, you won't retreat it."
5.0,"Some reviewers said jacket was not lined, this one was lined and well made.  I've gotten several compliments on the jacket. It does run a little small, so I would definitely size up one size.  I'm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"I‚Äôm small in top and medium on bottom. Tried both small and medium sizes, kept the small. It‚Äôs such a an easy breezy fit that sizing to medium wasn‚Äôt necessary. Love the adjustable straps and great fit. Most reached for dress that I have!"
5.0,Perfect Condition
5.0,This is the cutest swimsuit ever. Bought it for my 6 year old. She loves it!
5.0,Beautiful! This pants are HOT! Feel gorgeous in them ;)
5.0,"Bought it for a friend ,she loves it !"
5.0,Beautiful statement piece. Very sparkly! Will be buying the silver one!
5.0,Fit good nice
5.0,I like the awesome red strips on this hat. I wear it with my gorgeous black coat.
5.0,My step father loved it and keeps it on his key ring
5.0,Cropped but still appropriate for work. I ran it through the wash once so far and no issues. Fabric isn‚Äôt soft but not uncomfortably scratchy.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted!!!
5.0,"You dress  was  a hit, three of my sister purchased  the  same dress."
5.0,my two Daughters love these caps and they are over 25 yrs old.
5.0,"First belt purchased over a year ago - I still enjoy it, but it's a tad much taking it off and on to switch pants every day. This new belt design is spot on!!! No different than any other belt, as far as changing goes.<br />Amazing quality and price!<br />I'll keep coming back for more!"
5.0,"These balls are tiny enough for a small child, yet exactly what I needed for the proximal hole in my smaller sized ears. I wear my earings constantly and often do not remove until changing over to another pair or syle. These have been in my ears since receiving them over 30 days ago. They wear well and hold their shine. I would not hesitate to recommend these Balls to anyone with smaller ears and/or as a gift for a child."
5.0,My daughter started having her period this year and is learning all the do's and don'ts.  After several mishaps I ended up purchasing these period underwear for her and she has been very pleased.  The fit and quality of the underwear is fantastic and she has not had any issues with leaks.  I will warn you that cleaning the underwear is not for the faint of heart but they have been such a success I went and bought another set so she will have one pair for every day of her period.
5.0,Comfortable and holds up well through long trail runs.
5.0,"At first, I was leery of the XL because I‚Äôm 38 1/2 in the hips. I wanted a fitted look not a tight one. Glad I ordered the XL because they fit just right. I typically wear a size 29 in jeans/pants. I recommend measuring yourself before purchasing, so you can order the correct size.<br /><br />They‚Äôre also 12 inches above my ankle. They fit like a petite. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù. For my height, they look great with my military style boots. They also look good with low top sneakers, too.<br /><br />This is a great buy, if you purchase the correct size. It‚Äôs a thicker stretch fabric, which I like. They have a pant feel, too. This is way better than the faux leather pants in the same style. Again, what sold me on this product is they‚Äôre pants."
5.0,"It is a very delicate garment finishes, the material is of excellent quality. Very pretty."
5.0,I used this for my grandchildren-works perfect!
5.0,"My daughter is very happy with these basic black bikini bottoms, they go with a variety of tops.  They are very well made and work well for her.  She is very thin, with a small bottom, so the back of the bikini covers more of her rear than it would on me.  This is something to keep in mind when ordering a bikini bottom, they really aren't ""our size medium fits all mediums"" or ""our size large size fits all larges"" even if you can tie them on correctly.  The ties are a nice touch.  Probably not recommended for the beach or for water activities in general because, well, I'm not sure they'd stay on.  More like a pool party style statement.  Would recommend."
5.0,Love love love these socks
5.0,"I got 2 of these, 1 for each sister for Christmas. They both loved them!"
5.0,Love it and fit like expected.
5.0,Excellent quality for the price. I ordered it to wear under a dress for a 50s/60s themed party. It was very comfortable to wear.
5.0,"Love the material, good quality, fit perfectly!!!"
5.0,Bought this for my husband. He wears it daily
5.0,Great gift item to remind friends to pray!
5.0,"Item is beautiful! The brown spot you see on the picture is not on the product. Although i asked for standard shipping, i got the item in only 2 days.<br />Good product, good price and great service."
5.0,Fit perfectly- it nice cause you can make it sexier by Tying the string tighter on the side the material feels a little cheap but not bad I get a five star for the price
5.0,These SOX help with my circulation and comfort. Legs and feet feel so much better now. I have .... and can afford several pair. I wear then all the time for work and play. GREAT SHIPPING and SUPPORT>
5.0,Don't know how it fits yet Christmas gift
5.0,"Honestly I‚Äôm impressed! I was also skeptical and all but it met my expectations! I love them üòç It can pass for my real hair, so happy with them so far ü§ó"
5.0,Wear them under work scrubs. They are warm enough but not hot. Soft and comfortable.
5.0,Lo acabo de recibir y est√° muy bonita ü§©
5.0,Love these got a lot of compliments on them
5.0,"Love the look and fit, comfortable"
5.0,"I am a 3X normally, so I went up to 4X and it is perfection.  So soft and comfortable.  It is long on my 5‚Äô2 frame, but it doesn‚Äôt trip you.  It just goes to my ankles.  Wear a bra and maybe shorts if you wear out in public.  It is beautiful enough to wear in public.  It doesn‚Äôt look like sleepwear.  It is warm for me, but it is 72 here (in my house, not outside).  Hot natured would want this in winter probably.  It took a long while to get to me.  About three months, I believe.  Worth the wait though.  May have had shipping issues within the company, etc.  Love it!  I haven‚Äôt washed it yet, but the colors are very nice.  I just bought two more colors."
5.0,Glad it was perfect.
5.0,"I will admit that for the price these glasses exceeded my expectations. Mine are a light pink but the polarization is wonderful. They fit comfortably, look good on my face, and I‚Äôm confident they are good to wear in the sunshine. I‚Äôm glad I purchased them and can recommend them. I wear them everyday. Thank you."
5.0,Soft and great quality.!
5.0,Very nice shirt!  Great design.  Quality
5.0,Love love love it!  They even took the time to call me to answer my questions and to make sure I would receive what I wanted. Love the quality as well!
5.0,"I am starting my Christmas shopping early this year and this will be one of my white elephant gifts~  :)  Sorry about the creases, it should go away if you hang it up for a couple days.<br /><br />Very nice apron!  I &#34;almost&#34; convinced my husband to be my model, he said he'll do it if it's a hot guy's body lol...  The material is a fairly soft and silky fabric, made with a polyester blend.  One size should fits most if not all, I had to tie a knot on the upper string.  The string is not adjustable so you'll have to tie knot or use clips to adjust accordingly.<br /><br />Would recommend~  It can be practical and entertaining at the same time.  :)"
5.0,Great dress. Versatile for different occasions. Liked the length of the sleeves.
5.0,Wife LOVES it!
5.0,Bought as a gift for my sister. She loved it and said it is besutiful. She's about 5'2&#34; and 150lb (give or take). She says it fits great.
5.0,"My son's entire baseball team bought these. They can be worn in most travel leagues, although one (Williamsport) asked the boys to remove them. Otherwise, we've loved wearing them!"
5.0,"Love this shirt! Bought it for when my son turns 1 year. He will be wearing it on his birthday, when we take him to the zoo for the first time. Can't wait!"
5.0,"Love this cardigan.  I had read the reviews and I went a size bigger, and it fits perfectly."
5.0,Bought for nephew so he‚Äôd stop wearing mine. He loved it.
5.0,This size was not true. It was too small and the material was cheap
5.0,size up with this brand. I bought a large and it fits great - I normally wear a medium. This dress is great. during the summer I'd throw a blazer on over it in the office.
5.0,My son loves his robe.  It fits true to size.
5.0,Super comfortable! Helps hide your bodies flaws. Fit was as expected.
5.0,Can't wait to see this on my oldest. She's going to look beautiful walking down the isle with me.
5.0,Just perfect. Very impressed.
5.0,I have been looking for a pair of sunglasses that would shield my eyes. I have cataracts and these glasses really work for me. The side shields are fantastic as they block the side light but leave enough for you to have the peripheral vision when driving.
5.0,"This is a simple T-shirt, but very cute and comfy. I really love the fit, I still have a shape. Then of course the saying is so me, which makes it even better. Overall, this shirt is really cute and for a great price."
5.0,"Good replacement wedding band. Especially if your wife (or husband... although it's pink... but hey) loses her super expensive one and you're already married.... but if you want to stay married, should probably but another gold ring (my wife hasn't left me yet though, will post again soon)."
5.0,Shirt is soft and fits perfectly love it!
5.0,What a beautiful band!  I had to take a lot of links out but the tool is amazing!!  You have to follow instructions and there are arrows underneath the band.  Forcthr peice it really takes a sports watch up to be able to wear to dressy occasions
5.0,The product arrived on time and I wear them to the SF Giants baseball games........
5.0,I have had planter plantar fasciitis For a long time and have been looking for these slippers that give me the best comfort of any shoes or slippers since having this problem. The heal is slightly raised and has a great cushion feel when walking. The arch support s just right for me. The slippers  lining is warm. Not sure about the way they will wear as the sole looks to be very soft and I would be apprehensive to wear them outside on a rough surface.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Every Halloween put one in the refrigerator or on the bathroom mirror and everyone is greeted with a screem... so much fun.
5.0,"My husband is a fireman. This is a great ring for him to wear, and not have to worry about losing a finger at work. Fits good"
5.0,Love the color and fit. The personal note was a wonderful touch. You sometimes get so disappointed with hats. This is a fabulous and good quality hat.
5.0,Durable easy to put on
5.0,After a few years I still have it and works like a charm
5.0,Does not vent moisture if you're job is very active and you get hot your clothes will retain moisture . If you're phone is in chest pocket it will have condensation on it and in the pockets. Recommend only wearing 30¬∞ or less.<br />No back pockets üëé no legal pockets.
5.0,"Good product, just as advertised & nice quality"
5.0,I love it fits me perfect looks classy I'm happy I bought it .
5.0,"These are the perfect hoops ever.. Light weight , and has that little shine that would show off.. Great buy.. I almost wear if everytime when I go out."
5.0,Great product and perfect size
5.0,"I needed a white dress for graduation pictures, but after searching in stores and having no luck, I decided to try Amazon (and SO glad I did)!<br /><br />This dress seriously fits like a glove and accentuates all my curves. I am 5' 4"" and 150lbs and ordered a medium. I have received so many compliments while wearing this dress and it makes me feel confident. I love this dress and how my pictures turned out. I definitely reccomned."
5.0,my daughter loves it
5.0,"Love , love , love these !! Fit as expected and give just the right amount of compression !"
5.0,"This was a beautiful scarf. I'm not surprised it's often sold out and they only have the blouses. The scarf was embroidered and just gorgeous for the price, very pretty and very soft and elegant. I love it. I highly recommend it, when it's in stock."
5.0,just perfect and sexy
5.0,"This is my first Croton watch. It's looks rugged. It's a heavy, stainless steel automatic. I like that. No worry about batteries. The large face is easy to read, and the bracelet is stainless also. I had to take out about four sections because it is a little large. all in all, a really good watch."
5.0,"Fast Delivery, Great Customer Service, Excellent Product!!! Just Excellent!!"
5.0,Was delivered on time and as advertised!
5.0,"I'm a volunteer fireman at the local fire station.  This is a great belt for duty pants.  My pants are some 5.11 tacticals with tons of pockets, and slightly too large in the waist.  I tend to cram a lot of things in the pockets. (You can see where this is going: south...)  This belt is rock solid, and holds everything securely.<br /><br />The webbing on this belt is tight and strong.  I'm most pleased with the strong metal buckle on the belt.  Others have complained about its appearance; this is more about functionality than aesthetics.  If you're making a fashion statement with a tactical belt, can't help you there.<br /><br />The belt is pretty long, but that's easily remedied.  Decide where you want the belt to stop in it's VERY snug elastic loop, and cut it in a rounded shape with good scissors.  Then, GENTLY use a lighter to singe the fibers closed again.<br /><br />I'll be getting a couple more to carry belt slide holsters when pistol hunting and/or hiking gear."
5.0,I love this dress. Very flattering and I get lots of compliments when I wear it. Great buy for the price.
5.0,My second. Liked the first one soo much I bought this one in a different color.
5.0,"Very flowing ,beautiful color, light but not see through material"
5.0,Perfect for putting your gate keys or side keys on when you don't want to take your keys out of ignition nicely made
5.0,"This belt was completely as advertised.  I have always been rough on conventional belts, rarely do they last me more than about a year.  With typical hole spacing every inch or so, a regular belt was always just a touch too loose or too tight, and the holes are stress points that cause the leather to break and/or tear.<br /><br />These EazyBelts, with their &#34;ratchet&#34; system, provide more precise positioning- about 1/4&#34; per &#34;click&#34;, and it does not require unbuckling the belt to reset it- either snug it up a notch or two, or hit the release to loosen it.  And, by not having to bend the belt back upon itself to disengage, like a standard belt, there is less weakening due to flexing the leather.<br /><br />Standing up after sitting for a while often means readjusting the belt for better fit and comfort- this belt makes it very &#34;Eazy&#34;.<br /><br />I think you'll like it- I believe that it looks better than a regular belt, as well."
5.0,"Comfortable, great quality fits as true to size"
5.0,"Even though I don't wear any prescriptions, this provides enough clearance for my Asian-&#34;sized&#34; nose to prevent fogging with my Crossbow while I'm at an indoor range. I so liked it that I got a couple more because I'll be purchasing more ESS eyewear."
5.0,Wore this to a game in May when the cold Lake Erie winds were blowing!  Great hat!
5.0,"Buying a hat sight unseen has often failed me. This time, I got the exact hat I wanted at a great price. I will stock up."
5.0,Nice larimar stones & pretty silver design. Small earrings. Not overpowering
5.0,"Got this as a present, in &#34;lava&#34; ... the color is bright, the fleece is soft and surprising warm for midweight.<br />I'm very pleased with it."
5.0,"I got a beautiful necklace from my man for Christmas & I love it with all my heart, but it didn't come with earrings.  I've been looking for something to match it & these are it!  I can't believe how beautiful these are.  And the right size.  Not too big."
5.0,"I had low expectations considering it is an knock off not made by Samsung - but this is far better than the included bands that came with the Gear S2. I also purchased another black band with white stripes from the manufacturer which goes great with my Silver S2. However, this band dominates all others in comfort and usability, and I love that the excess slack hides behind the band. The clasp design is also superior as I am not constantly hitting the buckle when typing or doing work at a desk, as I do with the buckle-type bands. Lastly it's also now my most attractive band. I love the pure black with the silver watch.<br /><br />I hope the durability matches my first impressions! I will report back if there are any issues."
5.0,Beautiful and my granddaughter will think so too.
5.0,Awesome to work with üòä
5.0,Love it so cute!!
5.0,Absolutely stunning watch in the classical Portuguese style with very large dial and easy to read.  I'm in love!  Arrived in couple of days as promised.  Terrific value.  Update:  Have been wearing this beauty for four years now and still love it.  Changed battery twice and works fine.  Wish they would come back with more models.
5.0,My 13 year old daughter loves this dress.
5.0,"I love these, my first pair of seamless leggings and they are definitely squat and sweat proof.  Quality is very good and hold you in all around. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 about 135 and the small fits perfect.  I will definitely purchase more."
5.0,Perfect quality.
5.0,The best version of the cheapo wayfarers you can buy.
5.0,"Just like the picture, excellent quality."
5.0,"this is the secnd one that I bought. I like the dress very much, it is longer in length and looks well."
5.0,These are so cute! Bought for costume and love them. They are very secure.
5.0,Love this cover up. I have also used as a shirt with a tank under
5.0,Love the style and color of the pants. I had to stretch out the waist band a l little bit but after that they are fine to wear. I‚Äôm glad I bought these!
5.0,Love them...comfort at its best
5.0,I was very pleased with this product. This item was a gift for my husband. He loves them. He said they are more comfortable than the other tongue rings he has purchased. Great Item!
5.0,My 10 Year old LOVED it!!!!
5.0,I normally wear M/L sizes and ordered these leggings in M size. These fit really well and are very comfortable. Not sure if I like the design on the side but it‚Äôs not a big deal. Definitely one of the most comfortable pair of leggings. The cute little bag is an added bonus.
5.0,Just received this belt and so far it fits perfectly and seems to be very durable leather.  I'm very  pleased.
5.0,Perfect for our costumes!
5.0,"The only thing you need to keep in mind that the size of these gloves is smaller than what it said. I always wear small but after reading other people's reviews, I had to pick up the medium size which perfectly fit in my hands. So briefly, if you were Small you need to order the medium size, if you wear medium you need to order the large size ...and so on."
5.0,This review is for the black frame with leather strap. It's a 22mm watchband!! Love this! The leather watchband that came with it's okay but I have numerous 22mm watchbands I can use.<br /><br />I purchased just the frame before and it was an odd sizing. Didn't like it. Think it was supposed to be a 23mm spacing to use Fitbit Blaze bands but I ended up using a 24mm watchband.<br /><br />I wish I knew this was a 22mm spaced housing before. I would have also bought a silver one. Currently they are out of stock. Hope they bring them back!
5.0,"I love the lanyard, images looked accurate not distorted. The shirt is a good length for a crop top. The design is clean, material over all is good quality."
5.0,Good for 8+ years old kids I'd say
5.0,"Looks identical to the photo! It's been on the same keychain with about 20 keys, since December, and it still looks perfect!"
5.0,Beautifully brilliant!
5.0,"Beautiful detail in the tree. For the price, Highly recommend."
5.0,Perfect! I'm so glad I found these.  I was getting tire of alwayse losing the stone out of my other studs!
5.0,Easy to replace! I‚Äôm
5.0,Very cute and fit as expected. Bought for a valentines party.
5.0,These truly are oversized. And great color.
5.0,I love this dress so much that I ordered it an the other available color. It‚Äôs so slimming and comfortable!!
5.0,Love this top. Bought one also for my granddaughter. She loves it too
5.0,They aren‚Äôt cheaply made!
5.0,Beautiful Cardigan!!!
5.0,These were perfect for what I was looking for!
5.0,These glasses really work at dimming the bright oncoming car lights so I can drive at night with ease. Love these glasses!!!!
5.0,"Love this shirt!! I‚Äôm getting ready to order more colors. Fit is perfect.I did order 2 sizes up though.  1 size up would fit also ,I just like them a little loose with leggings due to my age."
5.0,Good quality belts.  Very pleased.
5.0,Love the bag and the storage ability. . Definitely worth it.
5.0,I love this skirt.  The color is very bright and pretty.  It's a 5 star for me.....I will order more colors.
5.0,I waited to photograph and write the review to see how they hold up.<br /><br />Great quality for a rough and tumble kid.  I like that the straps hold deeper across the side of the foot so it‚Äôs easier for kids to keep on.  It has raised edges so the foot can fit nicely into it.  The textured bottom makes them less slippery. Great cushion bottom compared to other brands.<br /><br />They are well worn and thoroughly tested by an active boy.  My son is sensitive about how shoes fit.  They are kid tested and mom approved.  Will buy again when he grows out of these.
5.0,love these charms. very well made. not painted or plated. love to make jewlery with these.
5.0,"I purchased this cute hat for an upcoming Downton Abbey party, but I can see myself wearing it for almost any occasion. It's lightweight & super comfortable."
5.0,Very nice... well made... completely satisfied
5.0,This product was just as beautiful as in the photo! Appears durable and closes securely.
5.0,Awesome..Good Purchase!!!
5.0,"Pretty and classy, don't change of color. Worth any penny."
5.0,These are small earrings but that is exactly what my wife likes. All of her earrings are of a similar design and size. I'm sure she will appreciate these earrings when she receives them as a gift for Christmas. Her skin breaks out in a rash when any jewelry is other than gold. These are a perfect gift for her.<br /><br />I like the design with the center stone surrounded with diamonds. They are nice looking.
5.0,Well made. Lots of room. Not too big. Will buy again.
5.0,"These little foot bracelets are gorgeous. They really show off your feet and give an exotic, elegant look. The straps feel  secure for lounging, posing for photos, etc. If I was going to dance or walk much in these, I'd want to secure them with a dot of false eyelash glue or fashion tape under a few of the larger coins to keep them in place.<br /><br />My feet are a size 9 wide, so they're not dainty. The ankle bracelet is adjustable and I had no problem getting them to fit. I was amazed how cute even my giant Fred Flintstone feet looked in this jewelry! I've gotten so many compliments on them.<br /><br />This is a great look with a long boho skirt or sarong, or for a beach, boudoir, bollywood, or bellydance photoshoot."
5.0,"My son prefers boxer briefs tight enough to stay down in jeans and stretchy enough to be comfortable<br /><br />The material is a Poly/Cotton and machine washable. It has a elastic waistband ad is tag free.<br /><br />The name is interesting and answers any design questions. Awesome 360 gives you full elastic waistband. An interesting note, there is no fly. Now, my son has no problem with this. In fact, he actually LOVES the design. He said he feels secure with this style.<br /><br />Summary:<br />* Material: 70% Polyester, 30% Cotton<br />* Classic-Fit leg (6"" Inseam), no Fly<br />* Machine wash. Tumble dry low. Do not iron.<br />* Elasticized waistband, tag-free for comfort"
5.0,"I was looking for a comfortable, easy-care long (preferably cotton) skirt for warm weather, and this checks all the boxes. Other reviewers recommended sizing up, and I am happy I followed their advice. My normal size is small or 6, and the medium is a perfect fit. The skirt washes well and doesn‚Äôt come out of the washer wrinkled. (I don‚Äôt put it in the dryer.) It‚Äôs a great choice for casual and vacation wear, and doesn‚Äôt come out of the suitcase wrinkled."
5.0,My granddaughter is a Harry Potter fan. I'm sure she will love it.
5.0,I love this shirt! It's cute under a blazer and washes well.  I do always hang dry to prevent it from getting out of shape and use my steamer to take care of any wrinkles.<br /><br />I typically wear a women's size XL but ordered this style shirt in a 3X based on other customer reviews; it was way to large.  I reordered the shirt in my normal size and it fit so perfectly that I now have it in several different colors.
5.0,What a nifty solution to a smelly situation! Great smell and works perfectly with the klitch. I love it!
5.0,"I bought his cloak to go along with my Winifred Sanderson costume. It's pretty nice, yes, it only has a closure around the neck..so needs to fit well to not slide down. I love that the hood is so big, it all drapes very nicely. I got the Medium size and I am 5' 6"" tall."
5.0,The necklace is absolutely beautiful and well made
5.0,real pretty bracelet
5.0,"We were very happy to find masks that are made in Idaho, not China.  They are the usual disposable masks."
5.0,This is a very flattering dress...I ordered the black dress and added a wide belt. I love this dress... Perfect ...would love more color choices
5.0,This black and stainless steel bracelet was exactly what I ordered. Came in a pouch but it will me on my wrist most of the time. Has a magnetic clasp so it won't come off easily. It's a good size and I will say it's one size fits most. Good quality and well worth what I paid for it.
5.0,Everything turned out great
5.0,I loved this product it works great fits good.
5.0,"I was searching for a onesie pajama for myself, the current one I have is in black so I wanted one which wasn't black to alternate with. I found this. This one was the cheapest. However after constantly looking at sizing chart I saw that the large size may not fit me . The size chart I saw said that it ran 1-2 cm smaller and it was in Asian size. So I got nervous, I quickly did a converting of the centimeter size to inch and feet... The large size wasn't going to fit a tall person like me which is 5 ft 8in... it may fit someone few inches shorter.... so I contacted the seller and within few hours I got a response. I exchanged it for a extra large... I just received it today.  Just be patient because it's coming overseas from china. However, the extra large is a bit baggy but good if you're tall. It is very warm and cozy. Comfortable. The only flaw is that it's not a zippered up one, it's a buttoned up.. so people with trouble buttoning should not buy. However it's unique because it has a zipper that zips from the waist to easy access to go to the bathroom... so no more stripping down to use the bathroom.  Before purchasing, I recommend that you look at the size. It's does run a little big. If confused, don't hesitate to ask the seller. They are quite friendly."
5.0,"very nice looking and the size , style and price are excellent."
5.0,"they actually fit like a glove, are well made and liked the first pair so much that i ordered 2 more"
5.0,Fits really good i like it so much üëöüíï
5.0,So very pretty! I wear a 1x had to buy a 3x for the correct fit!
5.0,My teen is loving this kit!
5.0,"I bought this chain to go along with a necklace that I purchased, and I think it accented it quite nicely. It wasn't too thick, or too thin. It seemed very durable, and it being made of sterling silver will ensure it doesn't leave any weird discoloration.<br /><br />Aside from all of that, it's CHEAP. I'm getting ready to buy another one pretty soon."
5.0,Heading to Disney in March and this is the perfect size for taking into the parks! Not too big and not too small! It arrived in perfect condition.
5.0,A very nice piece that can be worn in many ways on so many outfits!  A great Christmas gift!!!<br />Patricia Knowles
5.0,Sooooo cute!!
5.0,she wanted it for her like 7th chitsmas tree or something and so I got got it for her and she love it which is great because you never know what your gonna get with that lady if ya know what I mean. any way looks so good on a tree if that's what you're looking for like we didn't even need ornaments on the tree just lights because the hat really stole the show.
5.0,It fixed my back side. That's when I knew it was ok.
5.0,"Gorgeous dress!! So classy, and comfortable!! I wore it as a bridesmaid and it was absolutely perfect!"
5.0,"These made cute gifts for my granddaughter when she was in Seussical, Jr. She wears them all the time."
5.0,Works great and does not come off easily.
5.0,"Colors and design exactly at pictured, very pretty. Silicon cover, purely for cosmetic flair and won't offer your phone much protection aside from providing a barrier at impact. My buttons and charge hole are all in the proper place and fits my S6 perfectly. Shipping took about 3 days."
5.0,SEXY! PERIOD.
5.0,Works great. Great price
5.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 130 lbs. and carry wgt in my hips/thighs.  These fit very comfy, nice weight and material, wash & dry nice.  Happy with the product!"
5.0,"My dog has gotten into a bad habit of peeing inside to mark things. He has figured out how to remove the belly bands and doggy diapers so nothing was working. I needed a full suit for him, but everything made for dogs has a cut out for the belly, which is exactly what I don't need. So far he has not figured out to remove this so it is working. Plus he looks so cute!"
5.0,shiny!
5.0,"Oooh I am loving this more than I expected. It is lined with fleece- super cozy and warm. The outer knit is soft, sturdy, and a good medium weight. I like the mini visor. I love that I can just put this on  my head whether my hair is up or down.<br /><br />I am a big fan of winter hats, but this just added some versatility to my choices. It will keep majority of my head warm, keep my ears warm, shield my eyes a little from sun or glare. I think it will be cute and functional once the colder weather gets here.<br /><br />The dimensions provided in the product description says it fits 21.6"" to 23.2"". Just so you know, if you happen to have a big cranium like I do- which measures almost 24"", this fits fine. I'd say there is room beyond that too."
5.0,This t-shirt has a classic fit. I love the RBG message. The material is very soft as well. It‚Äôs cute with jeans and a French tuck.
5.0,"Great item, does the job well"
5.0,"My son was absolutely in love with this! He was BEGGING for it! I think it wasn‚Äôt worth almost $90, maybe $60, but he is such a good kid. Worth it."
5.0,Very nice shoe. Well made. Niece loved receiving the shoes for Christmas.  Pretty much wears them everyday. Super cute on.
5.0,"Perfect gift for your significant other. If they‚Äôre having a bad day or even a good day, this is there to remind them that it could be a lot worse, they could not have the awesome person who bought this keychain for them, in their life lol. My fianc√© loved it because there‚Äôs love and humor in there."
5.0,"MY DAUGHTER LOVED THIS WHOLE SET , THAT I BOUGHT FOR HER WEDDING ! IT IS ABSOLUTLY BEAUTIFUL , WE WERE BOTH VERY PLEASED !"

5.0,Easy company to work with.  Product arrived prior to expected time.  It's a good quality t-shirt and true to size.
5.0,"I'm 5'11"" and got a size large. I expected it to be so short that it was a shirt, like a lot of dresses in the past. HOWEVER, it's short but it covers all the right places! It is super flattering. So if you're tall and you're not sure, please go for it, Great for the price"
5.0,"I absolutely love this jacket. It is definitely my new favorite piece in my wardrobe. I am super happy with my experience with this company. The package arrived early, the jacket fits perfectly, the quality is excellent, and it matches the photos on the site.<br /><br />Not only is the jacket really comfortable and fashionable but I really love the ribbon detailing on the sleeves. This jacket is interesting and unique and goes great with my style.<br /><br />I am very pleased with my purchase and will continue to shop at Simplee in the future."
5.0,Great fit.  Speedy delivery
5.0,Like it alot.  Cute
5.0,"This is a great quality lab coat. I wasn't expecting it to be such great quality for how inexpensive it was. The material is nice and thick and it is stitched together very well. Best of all, my daughter loves it, and that's what's most important."
5.0,Even cuter in person
5.0,I love it. It's perfect for me and my fiance.
5.0,Very nice. The quality is so beautiful too..<br />Pet friendly. Pet hair won‚Äôt stick easily.<br />Bonus part it has pockets.<br />I am 5‚Äô4<br />140 lbs<br />Bra size 36 D<br />And I got the gray in Medium
5.0,Great belt for the price! I was looking for a good quality clean black belt and found it. Good buy.
5.0,Very cute & looks just as it is pictured
5.0,"Watch was way too small, but really nice looking if you have good eye sight."
5.0,"Will wear this as a top/tunic, not a dress.  Too short for me. Otherwise, Color, print & style are nice."
5.0,"Beautiful, classic, well made and fits perfectly!"
5.0,Very good value. Bigger than expected which is a plus.
5.0,"Fast shipping, my daughter loves it!"
5.0,Like it TONS!!! good quality I am happy with my purchase. I definitely will order from here again.
5.0,It has some weight to it but I absolutely love it!
5.0,These glasses are super cute and come with a really good case to hold them. We got the dark blue glasses for my 3 and 5 year old. They are a tiny bit big for my 3 year olds face but it doesn't matter to him and he wears them no problem. They are really great and I would highly recommend them for any children.
5.0,"I love these, they go with so much!!"
5.0,Used this for a costume party. It was comfortable and well fitting.
5.0,"This is the perfect dress if you‚Äôre looking for something casual or something a little dressier, it‚Äôs very versatile. The pockets are awesome and they aren‚Äôt too visible, so if you dress it up with a nice jacket or jewelry you can make it look classy. I‚Äôm a Florida girl, so for me this isn‚Äôt just a summer dress, I will be wearing it year round! It‚Äôs November now, and I‚Äôm absolutely wearing it out tonight. Just buy it, you‚Äôll love it! I only wish it came in an XS as I‚Äôm pretty tiny, but for a size small it‚Äôs just right. I‚Äôm in my first trimester of pregnancy so this will make a great maternity dress with the stretch and the little extra room!"
5.0,"This is so cute! I loved the sparkle from the photo online, but it was even prettier in person.  : )! I was worried that it might be scratchy from the sparkle texture, but not at all!  It's super soft, comfortable, and nice quality.  See my photo for a close up of the silver texture. This is the black dress.<br /><br />I ordered a Large. For size reference:  I am 5'9"", wear 36DDD bra, and my hips are 44""<br />I loved how the trapeze neckline looked and as a busty girl it is nice to have a modest top. The exposed shoulders and shorter length made this dress sexy and fun. The overall fit was good, my only gripe is that I think I may be a touch too tall for this dress.  Or my large chest could attribute to it - but the hem line was a bit shorter than my comfort zone. But I am a modest person. It landed just above mid thigh on me and I am 5'9"" -- so I think for a girl 5'7 and below (or flatter chested) this would be a perfect length.<br /><br />I bought this for a friend's bachelorette party so I don't mind that it is a little shorter than I would normally wear! lol Overall this is an amazing little number and would be so cute for going out, clubbing, or homecoming!"
5.0,"Love this wallet! Stylish, and just enough room for the essentials As with all MK products, I expect it will last a long time."
5.0,"It looks cool and has pretty decent quality, good value"
5.0,Definitely need more.
5.0,"This dress was comfortable, fit well, and affordable. It is sized as described, a little big, but this worked great with the belt I used. I ordered 2X and am size 20 irl. The dress is sexy slinky but not too tight. It was a mild but chilly night in Wyoming on Halloween. I didn't use a coat, just a pashmina shawl - the dress is thin but still opaque and I was warm outside by the fire and not too warm when inside. We looked great as Morticia and Gomez!"
5.0,These were just right
5.0,"I'd never purchased Teva before but these shoes are comfy, well made, extremely light, and support my feet well. They look good. I purchased my normal size and it worked well."
5.0,Very nice Like theme
5.0,"These earrings are so cute and petit,  perfect for those of us with short hair. They are so light that sometimes I reach up to make sure they are still there. I bought extra pairs to gift to my friends."
5.0,"Well I know I do good when my girlfriend gives me a kiss for something that I do. Giving her these and a few other jewelry items got me a lot of kisses. Thank you very much. People please order whatever you are offered here, it'll go well for you."
5.0,"I wasn't expecting it to be that great consider the price, I'm usually buy known designer hats but this one is simply great!<br />I needed a leather one for an outfit and I'm happy I bought this one.<br />Low price with high value!<br />Fits perfectly and I got compliments"
5.0,"Purchased this for Granddaughters birthday. She absolutely loved it,exactly what she wanted. Arrived quickly,looked exactly like picture, worked fine, all in all a great gift."
5.0,OEM fit and feel. Perfect replacement
5.0,I have gotten so many compliments on these pants! They are so casual but also have a classy feel to them. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 105lbs and they fit perfectly on the waist. They are a tad long but I mean just a tad nothing I can‚Äôt work with as I‚Äôm used to being vertically challenged<br /><br />Please have more patterns!?
5.0,Really nice and sized correctly!
5.0,"I normally wear a size 2 in kids,after trying on in a store the 2 was too big. I ordered these in a size 1 and perfect.....very comfy,soft wide elastic band holds shoe in place....buy it!"
5.0,I ordered large size and It fit me perfect !!!<br />Im 5'10&#34; and 190 p.
5.0,"I gave birth 12 days before trying this on. I'm 5'7"" and 12 days ago was 180lbs. Obviously I lost a bit of belly but definitely didn't expect this to fit. I was a size 8/10 pre pregnancy. It's a little Snug but has good stretch I'm not worried about busting a zipper or seam. I have two months to slim down before the wedding so it should be even better on me by then. Definitely happy with my purchase!"
5.0,Great fit. Not expensive to get lenses put in either. I went to walmart.
5.0,Super comfortable and very easy on the eyes. These look like designer sweats and feel like it to.

5.0,These are great socks.  I‚Äôve worn them doing yoga and other exercise as well as just wearing them around the house as slippers.  The grip is great on my hard floors.  I like the different prints and colors as well. They are pretty comfy so I find myself choosing these socks often during this stay at home covid time.
5.0,I purchased this cap for my daughter in law.  She absolutely loved it. The detail is awesome and sends a royal message of QUEEN. Colors black gray and brown. Therefore can go with any casual outfit. Great price and fast shipping. Received item under one week.

5.0,"Bought as a memory gift for myself. I love it, fits comfortably and wears well."
5.0,Good quality product with fine leather. Good value for money. Nice stitching which looks great. Has Timberland log hard pressed on the belt. Always buy one or two step larger than your actual measurement. The product I got was Made in India. Does come with a elegant gift box. Highly recommended.
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for.  Small enough to carry easily to weddings, dinners, special events but still roomy enough to hold the items I need to take along."
5.0,Teenager loved it!
5.0,Cute comfy and makes the but looks fabulous
5.0,perfect little gift for first time home owner.
5.0,"I love this watch. I have very small wrists and this watch doesn't look gigantic on me. I wanted something that beeped on the hour, shows the day of the week, and has a daily alarm and this is great. I love how flat it is. The watch has military time and 12 hour. I'm happy that I can turn the hourly chime off if I need too. The light is a little dim because it isn't a backlight but still visible. I haven't messed with the waterproof part yet but the rest of this watch great."
5.0,"Beautiful outfit AND fast delivery AND good price!  Thank You, Yolanda"
5.0,"I literally bought this dress at the last minute for a dinner party and let me tell you it fit GREAT, i received lots of compliments. For the price it is more than worth it."
5.0,"I love the simplicity and the comfort of sweaters like this. The medium fit me perfectly, and was in perfect condition. If you're checking the reviews to see how the quality holds up, then don't even worry about it and add it to the cart. It's legit."
5.0,So beautiful. Perfect for the price! Didnt want engravings so just ordered it without. August and november birth Stone. So perfect!! Didnt want to spend alot because we aren't done having children but wanted a mothers ring so bad
5.0,The bracelet is lightweight but still very sturdy.  The fit is perfect without having to remove links.  Would definitely recommend.
5.0,Good winter gloves
5.0,"Wanted this for my Damier azur LV neverfull GM. I bought the regular size in blush to match the rose ballerine interior of my bag. I like to semi since the sides in so it‚Äôs not totally open and wide.. I can kind of put the folded pieces of the bag in between the walls of this insert. It fits really well in the GM. It‚Äôs such a gorgeous match to the interior which I love. It has good pockets and seems like it will help protect the lining of my bag. Kinda pricey at 70+$ but if it holds up it will be worth the investment. There‚Äôs enough room between the pieces to stuff some blankets, cosmetic bag etc so that‚Äôs a nice thing also."
5.0,Exactly as pictured. It's going to go with our dresses perfectly. And shipping was surprisingly fast!
5.0,I like that these are stretchy and comfortable! I purchased them for my pregnancy since none of my normal underwear fits. These were exactly what I needed!

5.0,Good service/ love the earrings!
5.0,"Bought last minute for a dress for my daughter‚Äôs wedding. Weather called for something a little more summery. Was perfect! Comfortable to wear looked great, was very happy!"
5.0,These are great sunglasses for the price.
5.0,"She READY!!!! For husbands birthday, sometimes you got to put on that extra! This jumpsuit was spectacular. I did wear an extra plunging bra and used Hollywood tape to keep the &quot;v&quot; a little closed. I also wore a little shaper underneath which I was afraid would show through but didn't. Got a lot of compliments on this jumpsuit and can't wait to get another one."
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and about 185 pounds and I got a large. It fits but it‚Äôs a little snug. It‚Äôs also short but not so much where it would show my butt. Overall I love it and I like the quality! It doesn‚Äôt have any stretch to it but it does have a zipper.
5.0,"LOVE these boots! Warm and cozy, cute as can be (I get compliments all the time), AND extremely comfortable. I mean, really, what more can you ask of a boot?"

5.0,"Ordered this shirt for a toy story themed day on an upcoming family Disneyland trip. The product arrived on time and I was pleased with the fabric weight and print quality, it definitely has more correct details than the other jessi shirts on the market. however, the shirt was larger than I anticipated and I did not have time for an exchange before our trip. This company went above and beyond helping me out, they responded quickly and were so helpful. I was happy with the shirt quality, i am thrilled with their customer service.

5.0,"These are beautiful charms for a Pandora bracelet.  It was my mistake in thinking that it came with the bracelet but after re-reading, it clearly states that it's just the charms.  Guess I'll be purchasing a Pandora bracelet too now!  ;)  Otherwise, the beads are a very nice quality.  They don't look cheesy/cheap at all, which I was half expecting because the price is so great.  Overall, I think these will make a wonderful gift for someone who owns a Pandora bracelet.  I'm going to keep these bad boys for myself though!<br /><br />***I received this item at a discount for my honest opinion.  The discount in no way altered my review."

5.0,"[[ASIN:B01FVPK5N0 Purse & Handbag Light By NOOR - Built In Automatic Motion Activated Sensor - Lightweight Design - Clip For Easy Use - Ideal For Handbags, Suitcases, Travel Bags & Purses - A Must Have Accessory]]<br /><br />This little motion activated light is really bright.  I layed it on my bathroom counter to put in a purse.  When I came in later, it was dark in the room and when I walked in, it lit up.  I couldn't believe how much light it put out.  I think it could be used for other things other than to light up your purse because of that.  Great little light.  I was giving a discount for giving my opinion of this product.  I am glad I bought it.  Would be great for little gifts."

This is great for an ugly sweater party, and was comfortable to wear, not hot, and breathed well. If you have a six pack, dont buy this, just get the Santa jacket.

I did however have to place bandaids early in the night on the side of my ankle where the very top buckle meets my skin because it was beginning to chaff.

5.0,Bought as gift. My son really likes it: warm & comfortable.
5.0,"I love this triple folding umbrella so much. The wine red meteor shower umbrella has a very stylish look. The deep rich burgundy with meteorites (but they remind me more of raindrops) streaking from the center gives it a very unique look. The handle felt comfortable in my hand and the wrist band is a nice touch for keeping hold in strong winds. Opening and closing the umbrella was basic, just push the button and it pops open and then slide it till it snaps open. Likewise to close, just press the button to release. After closing it up I had no problem attaching the velcro and getting it back into its color coordinating storage bag. It easily fits in the side pocket of my car so I have it when I need it.<br /><br />I finally had a chance to use it during my daughter‚Äôs soccer game when it started to rain. I had many compliments from the other parents, wanting to know where I got it. The material repelled water, as it should, and the turn down edge helped keep more of the rain off of me. It took the wind off the lake without a problem. It is a nice size, close to 39‚Äù across. Two people could fit under it if they are cozy or small but it is more comfortable for 1.<br /><br />Bottom line: I love it. It is a great umbrella that has class and goes beyond your basic black. And all around any occasion umbrella.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this sample product at a free or discount rate in exchange for an honest appraisal of the item. I was asked to review it truthfully, no matter what star rating I gave. I hope that my review has helped in your decision to purchase this item or not. If you have any questions about this product, or any product I have reviewed, please do not hesitate to ask me."
5.0,"This dress is true to size and outs exactly as pictured in the ad.<br />Its a little big on the sides of the chest by the armpits... Which is strange for me because I have 500 cc implants. So if you are small chested, I would size down, out shouldn't hurt the overall fit through the body.<br />Large chested, order your normal size"
5.0,Put it on my seiko skx and it's the most comfortable bracelet I own. Cant beat a jubilee bracelet!
5.0,I have not used the mask as of yet. I purchased it for a wedding at the end of October.  It fits nicely.
5.0,"Very good price, and looks nice. It's a little thinner than what my husband is used to. But for such a great price, that was OK with me."
5.0,"The colors are vibrant and the sweater is comfortable. It can be worn casually with jeans or it can be dressed up with slacks or a skirt. I am 5'6"" and weigh 142 lbs. I bought a medium, which is my usual size."
5.0,"The minute I saw Encanto I knew I had to buy this Mirabel dress! It's tough finding Mirabel costumes for women (as of January 2022) but I came across this post and was elated to see they had my size. No prior reviews at the time, so I was hesitant on ordering but once it arrived and I tried on the dress... I was shocked by the quality! It's actually INCREDIBLE!!!<br /><br />The skirt is heavy and the shirt is thick enough that you cannot see through it! While the glasses are incredibly vibrant and they have no lenses so they easy to wear. The only disappointment was the earrings. They are clip on earrings so I often had them fall off my ears or get caught in my curls. With adjustment they might work out but I'll probably go out and replace the earrings.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommend grabbing this set before Halloween comes around! This will sell out QUICK! Also, make sure to triple check your measurements. I ordered a large and it's a perfect fit but I would've struggled with anything smaller."
5.0,Perfect and great price
5.0,"I have purchased similar infinity scarves at similar prices... this one has hemmed edges and a fabric that is soft, yet doesn't pill as easily as the other ones I've purchased. It's great to loop around twice for a short loop/long loop look -- which I prefer -- or, to loop around 3x if you're bundling up for a windy day. Great purchase, great price."
5.0,This was exactly what I was looking for. My friend loved it. And it‚Äôs absolutely cute!
5.0,Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
5.0,I love it. It hangs beautiful around the neck I'm happy with my purchase and for the price it's great üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
5.0,Compr√© para mi hija de 11 a√±os y ella ama poner ah√≠ toda sus colores y marcadores. Es grande pero igual se la lleva todos los d√≠as al colegio
5.0,Easy to wash and if very flattering.
5.0,Very pleased with this product this mask is breathable everybody liked it they asked me where I got it from and I told them where I it from right from Amazon I'm a satisfied customer with days
5.0,This dress was perfect for my 4 year old. She looked beautiful on her birthday. Thanks a million!!
5.0,"Great leather bracelet, it fits my wrist so well. I love it!"
5.0,Had shoulder surgery and was in a sling for 2 mo's  this was a life saver
5.0,Slightly sheer but I wore a white tank under and it was perfect. Goes great with jeans or dress pants. Want one in every color
5.0,"I like that i can put my keys in the pouch or cash, card or license in as well. I also like that if i didn‚Äôt have wireless headphones it was a spot the cord can go thru the bag to use it."
5.0,I love it but most importantly the person it was got for fell in love with it
5.0,"These have been great shoes for my 6 yo. They have held up well and I actually bought him the exact ones a size up when his feet grew. There are no holes or ripping of the material and my son thinks they are comfortable. However, my son has a narrow foot..my older son had a wider foot and we have never had luck with UA shoes fitting him as they are so narrow. FYI"
5.0,I've it it's great.
5.0,"I'm always on the move and I always have a bag that's similar to the this dtyle. It's cute, not too big or small and it's lightweight enough to take to a theme park, camping or to work. It's well made so I look forward to having it for a long time."
5.0,"Bought it as a gift, came with a nice pouch too"
5.0,Lg fit so stick to your reg size
5.0,It's wonderful.
5.0,Lovely tie-bow blouse. The cotton material part of the shirt may fade with time though.
5.0,"Really like these.  I wear a size 8, so if you are larger shoe size I probably wouldn't get these. I ordered these twice already. They stay on and don't slip off."
5.0,"The material itches at first, but soon wears in! I absolutely love them!"
5.0,"Bright yellow tags, wrote one with a sharpie. Seem to work fine. I ordered them because yellow is my favorite color and I figure I can spot my bag a little easier. Using them to fly from Denver to Seattle and on a cruise ship."
5.0,Daughter thought it had silver on it but had gold. She said pic was misleading but loved it. Only returned due to gold. Her shoes had silver. Didnt match.
5.0,"Nice and shiny, no kinks when it came. Good colors.<br /><br />Does unhook a little easily, but I wouldn't say it just randomly comes off. If you twist around a little it might but I've been wearing them for a while and it's fine.<br /><br />It's a tad tight. I only have a 28in waist and it's a tad tight, but not uncomfortably so."
5.0,It so colorful and nice.
5.0,"At first impression, I immediately thought of this bag only as a traveling solution. Now that I‚Äôve been using this bag for over a week for work, this could not be further from that.<br /><br />Aesthetically, the Low Ready black bag looks sleek and ready for business. It is made of high-quality nylon. Upon close inspection, I did not find any workmanship defects at all. All zippers (and there are plenty) work smoothly. All flaps are flexible but look very sturdy. The material certainly seems to be able to provide ample protection. The vertical rectangular design allows for the bag to stand firmly on its own as it has a stiff base and reinforced sides. I would not worry about it falling to one side in a public place. This is helpful when having a water bottle or coffee mug on the side net. The bag also features a back strap that goes on the luggage‚Äôs pulling handle as a nice touch.<br /><br />In the beginning, I thought the retractable shoulder strap was a bit gimmicky, but it has now become one of the bag‚Äôs best features. I can carry it with the top handle without dragging the strap or having to remove it. This could be especially useful when traveling and passing it through the airport scanner. It‚Äôs hard to go back to loose straps now.<br /><br />When it comes to storage, this seemingly compact laptop bag holds an impressive amount of items. The five pockets on the outside are well sized and diverse, and I can carry everything I need at the office. There are separate compartments on each side to hold laptops, tablets, pads, and literature. In the end, I was able to fit a 15‚Äù laptop and an 11‚Äù iPad Pro on one side, as well as literature, a legal pad, and a 17‚Äù laptop (yes, 17‚Äù!) on the other. I also have a Switch and the power bricks for both laptops, which were placed in the included bag that attaches to Velcro on the inside.<br /><br />Sure, all that stuff makes this bag super heavy, but I am happy to report that the strap and the balance make it relatively easier to carry. This also applies when carried by the handle as well. I do wish there would‚Äôve been an option for backpack use, like removable back straps, but that is a nitpick that may be for the next design.<br /><br />As you can tell, I am quite impressed with the Low Ready Laptop bag which by the way has now become my go-to office companion. The price may seem a bit high to some, but once you get to use it, and notice the build quality, design, and versatility you may find that it is a great value, as I certainly did."
5.0,"Everything I expected . Built to last, comfortable"
5.0,I love this deess! Perfect for wedding guest or summer
5.0,five starts
5.0,"I love it.  Will fit many sizes.  It probably looks better on a flat chest . I'm a B cup , but if I wear a push up bra the chains don't look as flat(tering)."
5.0,"Comfortable to wear, nose clips keep my glasses from fogging up, adjustable ear straps and reasonable priced.  Everything I was looking for. I will be ordering more."
5.0,They fit true to size and seem comfy for our toddler.
5.0,"The colors are terrific and go well with my complexion.  Also, it  makes me look slightly taller."
5.0,unbelievable deal for these. I needed to replace my stock band and was overwhelmed by the quantity of bands you get for the price.
5.0,"Love this comfy sweater! So cozy and soft, but helps you look put together!"
5.0,"I loved this keychain, it was perfect to give to my daughter's teacher for a gift. Looks exactly like the picture and felt durable. HIGHLY recommend!"
5.0,"These socks are so comfortable and breathable! I also love the length of them because they aren‚Äôt too short that your heel rubs on your shoe. That‚Äôs what I needed, a little bit taller socks :)"
5.0,"I love this dress! I am 5'11"", 170 lbs, 34DDD, and ordered both a large and medium. The medium was a little snug in the arms and bust, but fit well in the waist. The large fit well in the arms and bust, but was a little loose in the waist. I opted for the large because it was more comfortable.<br /><br />I paired it with a statement necklace and low chunk black heels, both from Amazon, and wore it to my cousin's wedding. It was warm enough for her outdoor ceremony in under 40¬∞ fall weather, but I was never too hot at the indoor reception either. I got compliments that the dress ""looked like it was made for my body"".<br /><br />I own one other PattyBoutik dress and it fits so well too! Quality brand!"
5.0,I am petite and thin and these tights fit me perfectly. The design was very cute. I definitely plan to order more and would recommend.
5.0,"I bought a size large although I wear medium because I don't want it too fitted but even the large looks great and it isn't baggy. You can feel safe to purchase your size or one size up. Plus the 2 pockets at the side is just genius! Plus there is a little size pocket at the back dimples area, can store money etc"
5.0,"Love it!  It's extremely comfortable and washes well.  Great price, too.  I'll be buying more."
5.0,I use to suffer from blue light eye strain that gave me the worst headaches as I still in front of two computer monitors and LED lights at work. I purchased these to give them a try and I must say in the two weeks I‚Äôve had them I haven‚Äôt had a headache since and I use to get these eye strain headaches everyday! I absolutely love these glasses and will recommend them to anyone with eye strain from blue lighting.
5.0,Super cute. My daughter loves this set!
5.0,Excellent material and doesn‚Äôt easily unravel! Great price for quality socks!
5.0,This hat is really high quality and adorable. The little cinch in the back helps to keep it on little heads. My son is 4 months and it is a little big for him - but it does say 6 months to 18 months so I suppose that makes sense! I will be buying another one for little sibling on the way.
5.0,"I bought this for my mum and I can tell she was very pleased with the item. It Madeline me smile as she had undergone a mastectomy (one-side) 3 years ago and had not been happy with most of the mastectomy bras I got for her. Besides being comfortable, I think she liked that this bra doesn't always run up nor run sideways (due to the new lopsided weight bearing situation) and maybe the lace made her feel womanly again. This is a repeat order and I am giving it 5 stars!"
5.0,"Scarf does have a 2 black lines of fabric along the seam, as others have mentioned. I doesn't bother me, I put that in the back."
5.0,These are just perfect for when j need to write something down quickly and have no paper. I can easily write on my counter top and can easily come off as well. They also come in handy for when I host an even and need to keep track of people's drinks. It makes it that much easier to reduce waist on plastic cups. We just use the glasses over and over. I was given a discount on this item for my personal and honest opinion.
5.0,Love it fit great just wish it was a little shorter I'm only 5'4 so it's kinda long but still extremely cute
5.0,Great quality for the price used them for one day and could notice a difference right away
5.0,"I was drawn to the unique look of these glasses, but was concerned about the lens area being too small. However, after losing a pair of reading glasses and breaking another pair, all in one week because I was constantly taking them on and off I thought I'd give these a try. At first, it was as I expected, being able to see the borders of the lenses, but within just a few minutes my eyes adjusted! I realized I was seeing just fine close up, my distance vision wasn't obstructed and no more on and off with the glasses. Brilliant!"
5.0,"It fits; Go by the size chart in the description. When it says a Medium is a 28in, that‚Äôs what it is. I measured it so you should be able to fit it if that‚Äôs your size.<br />It‚Äôs a lightweight corduroy, the buttons were cute and it looks just like the picture. It had a zipper in the back!"
5.0,I love it its exactly how its  describe ... will  buy more in the future a good scarf for a great price cant beat
5.0,"Fit perfectly as expected ,I have purshased from different online stors and the problem was always the sizes .but for this great quality blouse I have what I want .classy and great quality and fit perfectly ..I really like it .."
5.0,"I love this braclet , it's all I expected  the look is very unique I am ordering more for my friends"
5.0,"Hands down best leggings i have ever bought!<br />I got my first pair for much cheaper at costco but they dont carry them regularly. And i was beating my self up about not buying more. Thankfully amazon had them for a little more but these are hands üëè down üëè the üëè best üëè leggings so they are worth the price! I bought 2 pair!<br />What i love most about these leggings is they are much thicker then regular cheapo leggings, but not to thick to where you feel constricted. First time wearing them may seem tight but they loosen up perfectly. I hate when i get some leggings and they immediately strech at the knees and look horrible, that does not happen with these no matter how many days you wear them in a row! Yes i used to only have one pair and i am guilty of wearing them much longer than i probably should! But now i have 3 so i can be comfortable everyday!<br />I love them! I feel comfortable wearing them without covering my butt with a skirt or something too. I think the extra thickness of the material makes me feel safe to do so.<br />Seriously these leggings will be your best friens buy some!"
5.0,"I first ordered this jacket in a large, however, it was too big, so I re-ordered in a medium, which is perfect. At first, I was on the fence as to whether or not to keep it, but it‚Äôs so cute and cozy, I‚Äôve been walking my dog with it in the morning. This jacket is on trend at an affordable price you can‚Äôt lose."
5.0,I bought this one for my husband & he likes it.
5.0,"I've been using this style for over 15 years now. I first selected it at a store because it matched the texture of the collar of my shearling coat. Most importantly, I have a HUGE amount of hair and it's the only hat that stretches to fit it all. I just bought my third iteration of this hat two weeks ago. It is THE only hat I've used during the Winter. It lasts a few years (of daily Winter wearing!) and then gets a bit stretched and then I buy another. Each time, I panic that it's no longer made. I don't care what I'm wearing in my cold Canadian Winters as this is the only winter hat I have and use."
5.0,"Fit good as expected, soft and comfy."
5.0,They really work. I wear them when i do my work out sweat in all the right placesüòÇüòÇüòÇ
5.0,"Love this belt. Not the usual blah belt, it looks classy while still being casual."
5.0,"I have a small bust, 34Bish.  After having a baby I have a bit of flop at night and these work well to support but are support pretty and comfortable. They also add a bit of shape due to the removable liner which is nice because after breast feeding for over a year I need it.  Love these!  Hand wash them the first time because the purple bleeds a little but after that they are fine."
5.0,These are great sunglasses if your lenses are not too tall.  They are a quality made product with rubber pads on both sides of the gripping surfaces to protect your lenses.
5.0,I sent it to a love on on there 50th birthday and they love it.  The 5 pearls were the perfect gift of love...
5.0,[[VIDEOID:da4d04f6affce60761d60b56fab5cd4d]] So first off open this outside and shake shake shake the glitter off. It‚Äôs so sexy!! Love it and it‚Äôs forgiving with the train in the back. Can‚Äôt wait to wear this. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 137 it‚Äôs a tad short in the torso but it works.
5.0,"I loved the puffy sleeves. Dani from coffeebreakwithdani on YouTube made me buy it! She hyped it up and now I see why! Great material, vibrant color and it‚Äôs perfect for winter and spring. I love it and need more colors!"
5.0,"I love these socks. The colors are wonderful, they are soft, washes very well and looks super cute on my 1 year old. My husband would love them in his size üòÄ"
5.0,"I purchased the leopard print months ago. Although the band itself is still in good condition, there is a spot in the band where the print is erasing. I loved it so much, I tried to purchase it again, but it‚Äôs out of stock. Too bad!"
5.0,Love this curtain - beautiful colors and detail and the best part is it does not smell like a vinyl shower curtain - it's perfect!
5.0,Love it and thank u
5.0,"I selected this pin carefully from among Amazon's many selections.  It is a darling pin.  I wore it to the funeral of my great-aunt, who was tremendously proud of her (our) Polish heritage.  It is tiny enough to be tasteful, yet pretty enough to be noticed.  The gold metal is of nice sheen and quality."
5.0,Works and looks cool
5.0,This dress was a dream!  My daughter who hates zippers loved this zipper-free dress.  It was very soft and very flattering.  I washed it on delicate with no problems and dried it on low.  My daughter loved twirling in the dress.  She called it her ballerina dress.  I would order again in a different color.  So glad it came in black when we needed it.
5.0,just what i wanted to drive in sunny conditions can't beat them for the price
5.0,"I love the tortoiseshell in these, it's more distinct than others. Beautiful classic look."
5.0,Cute readers with a little bling!
5.0,Worked perfection and helped minimize my back-fat.  LOL
5.0,For my 11 years old son‚Äôs birthday. Kids loved it!!!
5.0,Worked perfectly for NFL game.
5.0,"For the person who works out at the office or during lunch and needs a sturdy work-out bag with lots of room and compartments, this is the perfect choice. The back-pack option makes it easy to carry [especially for public transit]. The bag is sturdy and well-made, and the gold trim gives it a little extra style. I was pleasantly surprised by how much room it has, and will be trying it out for an overnight trip as well."
5.0,My son loves his. I normally  have to by him 2 to 3 jackets a winter because he is hard on equipment and I did buy name brand. Not this year still looks great and no rips or tears. The price was great and I recomend to anyone looking for a tough winter jacket.
5.0,"I wear them to protect my arms from the sun's burning rays.  These were especially helpful when I was in Thailand, blocking the sun but not overheating me.  The fabric is very soft, and thin as well--a bonus.  Perfect product for my need!"
5.0,They are perfect.  Thank you
5.0,"Muy bonita, buena calidad para tan bajo precio."
5.0,"Great fit, very warm and incredibly comfortable. Well made gloves that are a must for the cold weather"
5.0,"Really didn't  expect to like it....was afraid it would be too big.  It's not! Great size, really good copy, looks like all the other ones I see everywhere.  Who knows...maybe their all fake!<br />#fake...don't care."
5.0,"Lo compre para los 15 a√±os de mi ni√±a . Esta bello , buena tela y excelente terminaci√≥n<br />Lo recomiendo con confianza . Soy una persona muy exigente y cr√©anme k cumpli√≥ mis expectativas"
5.0,This cap is very comfortable. I have gotten several compliments. Love wearing it to work to cover my protective natural hair styles!
5.0,"I used to buy sans sleeve Reebok hoodies  back in the day for an extra sweat layer for my cardio workouts but this one is a lighter weight version I like using over my  t-shirt  when it start's getting chilly but I still want free arm movement  ( tennis/ ping pong, golf, darts) . Want to get some of these for my brand. Light but feels like good quality."
5.0,I liked the fit it wasn‚Äôt to fitted. I love RBG
5.0,I can't believe how soft this robe is and it washes up so nicely - no pilling at all. It is very warm and will be really nice on cold winter mornings.
5.0,"Love this top. It's soft and lightweight,  but not see-through.  Fits well."
5.0,this is the kind of purse that every woman would love.  I carry a lot of stuff in my purse but this one has extra space that I did not even have to use.  It is a great purse for someone who is organized.  again love it.
5.0,"The color of these is RIGHT up my alley, I'm in love with them!! It's most blue and has tinges of purple and green around the edges and in the fade of the colors, it's awesome. The shades are well-mirrored, even thought they're the tiniest bit see-through from the outside, but the tint is comfortable to my vision while wearing them. They're comfortable to wear physically, too. Great fashion shades."
5.0,I loved this item! It came in a nice box with a very sharp looking leather wrist strap! Very very unique watch! I love it! I definitely recommend as a railroad approved watch and just a great watch to wear in general! üòä
5.0,It holds my new S7 egde phone perfectly & it is beautiful!!!
5.0,"[[ASIN:B01NAI9RNZ Two Piece Swimsuit for Women Halter Bathing Suit Ruched Skirted Swimwear M]] I was very hesitant to buy a swimsuit on Amazon without trying it on, but this suit is great!  I received compliments on it, I am comfortable in it, and it is a great price.  I highly recommend it.  Am considering getting a second one just so I have a backup when the first one wears out."
5.0,I am a size 8 dress and it fits perfect.  The colour and style is good.  The hip size is spot on. not tight. The dress falls below my knees..Just how I like it.  Would highly recommend
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. Would order more. Great value for the price.
5.0,Very cute! Very pleased!
5.0,i love this bag! will order again
5.0,This is absolutely great because it keeps me warm and the stylish design is really good.
5.0,"I love this outfit, it fits just right, I am a very curvy girl, so I got XXL to make sure the shorts didn't roll up as I walk (had that experience with other products, so I knew to get a bigger size), colors are beautiful. I wore it and machine washed it with Woolite in cold water, still looks brand new, no issues once out of the washer. I got so many compliments, especially from men, which was a plus."
5.0,Love the design.
5.0,Purchase this for my husband for his Halloween costume. The mask is super sturdy and looks amazing! It does weight down on the nose after wearing it for a while. I suggest adding a foam nose piece or cloth to keep it from sliding.
5.0,"What's with the high price.  They were $29.99, now $49.99.  That is a huge jump. And no colors."
5.0,Great add on piece for a jumper or dress.  Flattering...
5.0,These are great. Pleasantly surprised.

5.0,This is such a beautiful hat that when my father saw mine he wanted one of his own. So I order him one too.
5.0,IT IS THE PERFECT BAG CHARM FOR MY FIANCE'. HE LOVED IT
5.0,Got it a day early which is always great. It actually has a little bass in it and I wasn't expecting that. Call quality is good too. Well worth the money.
5.0,"Gives you tight looking, tiny waist and doesn't flatten out the backside. I bought one in each color."
5.0,"As is the case with a lot of clothing from China, this runs very small. I‚Äôm a size 12, and I can‚Äôt close it in front. If you are a size 8 or smaller, this will fit you properly. If you are any larger, forget it. The seller offered me a full refund, which was nice. Good customer service."
5.0,"I bought these for a gift (for a guy) and was happy to see they don't look cheap, especially for such a cheap price.  Very happy with them, and  they recipient was very happy as well!"
5.0,"Me encanto,muy comoda"

5.0,great buy..as expected authentic.. pleased
5.0,Nice size. Very pretty
5.0,"I like this PJ set.  I like the elastic at the bottom of the pants.  Since I am 5', 100 lb, the pants gather at my ankles without excess fabric. The fabric is comfortable.  The fit is loose...just the way I like it!"
5.0,"Great, comfortable hat with ponytail or not!"
5.0,"Absolutely adorable. I was nervous about purchasing a white dress but I'm so glad I did. It wasn't see through as I feared most. It's light, comfortable and adorable."
5.0,I had never seen this color agate before. Its beautiful to say the least. I see its currently unavailable so i guess other people liked it too!
5.0,Love these shades! They‚Äôre adorable and my kids love them.
5.0,Sizes run larger.  A size 8 on my 8 year old son who wears a size 8 was big.
5.0,"This dress was perfect. It restored my faith in humanity. I was recently so disgusted with the way the world has been going (global warming, immigration, the Kardashians) that I decided to design a type of underwater apparatus that would allow me to stay under water permanently so I could go live with the lobsters. Of course there would have to be some connection with the surface as I would need an oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanger, and I was so close to perfecting this, I just couldn‚Äôt obtain a reliable power source. While searching for an underwater rechargeable battery system, I came across this dress, and was so inspired by the look and design that I purchased it immediately. It fit so perfect and I love it. If this dress could save me from a future under the dark abyss of the waves with only my crustacean friends as company, just imagine what it could do for you. I will still spend Wednesday evenings under water with my lobster loves (or lubbys as they like to be called), however for the foreseeable future I will be spending my time above the waves. Thanks!"
5.0,I usually wear an 11 so I ordered a 10 based on other reviews and this shoe fits great! It's very light weight and comfortable! I'm definitely going to reorder this shoe!
5.0,"I am super happy with the quality and beauty of this shirt.  I would HIGHLY recomend this shirt.....except for the fact that if YOU ALL buy it, we will ALL look FABOULOUS!"

5.0,Very cute. Exactly as described.
5.0,My husband says they look nice and are serviceable but a tad thin. Thank you.

5.0,Has been washed 5 or 6 times already and still looks and fits great. Wear it when I take my 70 chevelle to car shows.
5.0,Comfortable and true to color description.

5.0,Great all around fit
5.0,"Love these glasses. Great quality for the price, I have been looking Everywhere for a decent pair of polerized sunglasses that aren't expensive and glad I found these. I also like the fact that you are able to order two pairs. The second pair isn't polerized but they work as a great back up if you ever lose the other ones( which happens quite often in my case)."
5.0,Makes my son feel like he has a hug all day. The sizing is a bit tricky.  We needed to upsize from the recommendations to get one that he was comfortable in.

Then she tried it on, with my help<br />it was much easier. .............She loved it!<br /><br />‚¶Å‚ûΩ The Material is smooth and soft...The colors are vibrant and<br />without any distortions in the pattern.  The collar had a pattern,<br />with what appeared to be little gems or crystals, from what we<br />could tell.  A solid dark color would have sufficed.  No problem,<br />We just thought it was somewhat out of place.<br /><br />‚ú™ | ‚ûΩ  OVER-ALL:<br />This Butterfly Wings Set... is lovely and is a nice Gift to give.

5.0,"I love these pants! They feel great, and they look like a million bucks!"
5.0,Loved them they are so pretty !
5.0,"The best socks I have ever purchased. If you plan on buying a pair...buy two, you won't regret it."
5.0,My son loves these shoes. They arrived quickly and perfect. Thank you very much.
5.0,The bag is great. I purchased the tote for my best friend at work. She loves it. This tote has many pockets and separaters that come in handy !!
5.0,A good braclet to have looks real nice
5.0,worked good for my sister's project
5.0,Love my statement necklace. It really set off my dress I wore  with it.
5.0,"Looks great on. Not too thrilled with the fixed bust padding though, looks awkward if you plan to wear it with a bra"
5.0,"Everything about this experience was terrific. The seller's site was easy to navigate, there was a great selection of jewelery, and it all looked really good.<br />The pendant is much nicer in person than the photos can do justice. It's very thick and heavy, and is just the right size. My only complaint is with the description, it's not a dragon on the hammer, it's J√∂rmungandr, or the Midgard Serpent. Other than that, I absolutely love the pendant and am very very happy with my purchase."
5.0,This is my go to necklace. Well worth it.
5.0,"These leggings look like other high end leggings, but without the high price tag. They‚Äôre soft and passed the squat test. They have a thick waist band that help you feel sucked in. However, the rest of it doesn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not compression material. If you‚Äôre looking for leggings that will hold you in these are not it. I did sweat and they didn‚Äôt look horrible. I got the blue color so if you don‚Äôt want sweat to show go for a darker color."
5.0,"Love this bag!! Outside pockets for cellphone and keys, and a roomy inside for wallet and kindle etc."
5.0,Love this good quality and beautiful color will buy other peices
5.0,My wife loves it and uses it all the time.
5.0,This fabric is ultra soft. I think it will be very cool when wearing in this hot heat. True to size
5.0,"Perfect crystals and a great price! You can see the glue on some if you look very closely, but not a huge deal. The stones are authentic."
5.0,Super cute. I wear a large or x-large and the medium worked. Great office or casual sweater. Lots of compliments which are appreciated.
5.0,"It was a gift, and she liked it!! She has already worn it!! She likes that type of bracelet, and it was for her birthday and was her birthstone."
5.0,Soft and warm. Super cute
5.0,as advertised.  have had one in last years and if this one works as well I will be really happy.  I was always clumsy and falling and much better balance now.  previous one is wearing out so this is to replace it
5.0,Already got compliments!
5.0,Most room to breathe and talk without fogging glasses. Don‚Äôt feel claustrophobic at all in them and great for keeping in purse or glove box since individually wrapped
5.0,My friend &#34;absolutely LOVED&#34; her bracelet that I gave her for her birthday!
5.0,The earrings are very nice.  The backs are tight so the earrings don't slip or catch and fall out easy; and the multiple sizes make for great selections if you have multiple piercings.
5.0,Warmth in home
5.0,Very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,These shoes are beautiful and so comfortable to wear for hours!!! Worth every penny!
5.0,My daughter loves this dress.Nice floral design and made of  breathable cotton. nice and strong stiching..

5.0,Purchased this for my daughter and this is actually one of her favorite choker.
5.0,very satisfy all the way around!
5.0,"I loved the how the polka dots add texture to the dress! The cream white color is a beautifully flown dress perfect for a date night! I would say it‚Äôs more of a dressy look rather than casual! I like how you can adjust the waitband with a tie, I added a belt on top of the dress to add! It is light and flowy and super comfortable to walk around in! Size LARGE"
5.0,Beautiful color and comfy
5.0,Fits perfectly !!!
5.0,Good tanks are hard to find and a great design too.
5.0,"These worked very well for the outfit I had in mind. Only needed yellow, but it was more value getting the pack."
5.0,"The material feels amazing and the shirts fit like gloves. The shirts look exactly like the pictures, vibrant colors and all. Great product."
5.0,Easy to get on and we get lots of comments about them- they are super cute! My daughter's feet are on the narrow side so there is plenty of room in the width.
5.0,Love all three of these bands. The photos do not do them justice. They are so much cuter in peraon!
5.0,Exactly as shown and described
5.0,"The pictures do not begin to describe how really beautiful these earrings are! Why can't you find this quality in stores anymore? I really like that you can wear just the small star stud, or add the bigger star also. They really sparkle and shine I just love and highly recommend!"
5.0,Purchased for my daughter who is an artist and she fell in love with it.  The case isn't meant to protect the phone if you drop it.  It's clearly meant as a showcase piece that you can talk about with your friends.  She likes that it's made from a rubber like material because it doesn't slip out of her hands.  The colors are very vibrant.  Overall she's happy with my purchase.
5.0,"Very comfortable, fits great over my body armor. Not sure how black will do in the summer months, but so far on sunny days in the 70‚Äôs it has been good."

5.0,Great my daughter loves it ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. I love the way it looks :)
5.0,Excellent product specially if you like to bike for a hours
5.0,He likes it. It was a birthday present.
5.0,"I have been buying these for years. Best investment ever! I don't know how these aren't more popular, instead of letting my small waisted child suffer in saggy pants I use these to adjust the waist. Perfect"
5.0,I purchased two different MockingJay Pins...this one and a different one.<br />This one is far more bright and shiny than the other.<br />This looks &#34;gold&#34; where the other looks &#34;bronze&#34;.<br />My daughter has used both for different purposes.<br />She used this brighter one for a stage scene since it shone more from the stage.<br />The other she used for a film scene where the camera caught more definition (and the &#34;gold&#34; would be too much for poor District 12).<br />So it all depends on what look you're going for.
5.0,This is as cute as the photo. Nice weight for a fall jacket.
5.0,Loved it and looked great for a class reunion. It was exactly as described.
5.0,"The design is beautiful, exactly as pictured. A sturdy wire along the leading edge let's you adjust how they angle forward or back."

5.0,I loved this dress. It was perfect
5.0,Very cute hat.  Fits perfect and offers a lot of shade.  The color is a nice purple and looks feminine and flattering.  Thanks!
5.0,Small and cute size
5.0,"This item is very pretty, the color is a soft pink and shiny, I do really like it, however, after two weeks a stone fall off, the good thing is that is not very noticeable so it's ok, would of liked to receive some extra stones just in case, but well =happy with item, arrived &#34;fast&#34; as promised."
5.0,"I am 5'11 and this dress went to my ankles. It looks beautiful on. Even though I'm 30 weeks pregnant it feels so comfortable. It accentuates the baby bump, and the fit is very flattering. I'm looking forward to wearing it to my baby sprinkle!"

5.0,Look great and of great quality purchased two for my nephew and son to match and it came extremely fast hope everything goes well when washing
5.0,These earrings are beautiful. I definitely recommend them!
5.0,My mother in law does not have pierced ears and has had a difficult time finding nice jewelry. I must say these are the prettiest pair I purchased for her and the clasp is tight so she has not lost them.
5.0,"Great looking hat. I have received many comments, from people I do not know, telling me how good the hat looks."

5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! Its gorgeous. It is slightly see through but not bad just wear skin color underwear. I am 5'6&#34;,120 pounds. It does drag on the the floor, so you will need heels or just take a couple or more inches off, depending on your height. My measurements are 34C bra size, 25 inch waist and 34 inch hips. I purchased a size 0/2. If there was a smaller size, I would have gotten it. But I am beyond pleased with my purchase. I definitely recommend."

5.0,"Super comfortable, and I have pretty large breasts and this keeps them held in nicely while not being too constricting. Over all I would definitely buy this suit again."
5.0,"As a woman writing, this shawl was just as I had hoped and fit its description.  It was of generous size for wearing as in the photo, had a rich color, good weight and was very soft.  It had a label attached that said 'cashmere' but I don't believe it really was that."

5.0,"Mach the picture, nice color, fast shipping and I love it!"
5.0,I was very pleased when I received these. I ordered them because they were surgical steel and I typically have a hard time finding cute jewelry that is made of it. Both of them came exactly as they are pictured. When I put them on they fit perfectly! In the past I have had problems with the bar looking to long or short but these were just right! Over all I would 10/10 recommend.

5.0,best shoes
5.0,I bought one for myself and I liked it so much that I bought one for my boss. She loved it. It will hold plenty of business cards but it also does not take up very much room in your purse. I would recommend to anyone who needs a business card holder.
5.0,"I love it. The only complaint I have is that those tops are not geared towards short/petite people. I am 5‚Äô2, I got the Medium and it‚Äôs a bit too long. Other than that, great sexy top!"
5.0,Love this product!  Well made and looks awesome!
5.0,Excellently made. I order 3X as I am 46DD. Holds everything tight with comfort. Pads are nice too and not thin. Excellent Buy!

5.0,Looks great on. Very soft & comfortble
5.0,Fits As Expected for a Person of Average Size
5.0,Just received my band and so far I love it. It fits so comfortable. Love the blue color. Only problem it was a little tight to put on one side.  But I figured it out.
5.0,I had to buy a new pair of slippers b/c my puppy chewed them up (insert eye roll)!! After some shopping on Amazon I settled on this pair for the price and the reviews and they are exactly what I was looking for! I have cold floors dur to a crawl-space for a basement so this worked out perfectly! They are nice and thick and then the rubber bottoms are a great addition as well!
5.0,"I love that the pack comes in 3 different colors. The tops are cute and flattering, and perfect for low-impact workouts like yoga, pilates, or weight-lifting. I used it for yoga and even though it's tight-fitting, it doesn't ride up my ribs. I personally don't intend to use these on high-impact exercises like running, body combat, HIIT, or any other cardio because they are not moisture-wicking. Other than that, I think this is a cute addition to my workout clothes :)"
5.0,Great shoe! I wear size 5 in regular shoes but order size 5 1/2 for  zumba shoes because I use an insert. It fits true to size & love the price!
5.0,I'm stunned by the high quality of this watch for the price. It's exactly as shown in the photo and I couldn't be happier with this watch.  Highly recommend!
5.0,"I've been looking for a good cell phone purse for a long time now and was very happy to find this Befen one. There is a lot of quality in the purse and Befen paid strict attention to details. I purchased the purple one which is a beautiful, rich color. I am particularly pleased with the quality zippers and secure hardware for attaching the wrist strap and crossbody strap. My Apple iPhone 6S with a slim case fits perfectly. In fact, I can also use this as a wallet for my larger purses and totes. The 4 secure pockets are great for organization. My purse arrived packaged in a nice zippered bag that can be used for storage. The Befen cell phone purse is very stylish. I will purchase more for friends and family."
5.0,Real good quality leather. I have used it for about a week and really pleased with how this belt looks.
5.0,"I really like these they are great, I love the shape and size they fit perfectly on me and I've been looking for a good pair for a while , I really adore these sunglasses so much even my mom is a little jelly about how cute they are"

5.0,"This cap is high quality and very comfortable, especially the material inside that touches the forehead. I plan to buy more and share with all my nurse friends. Thank you!"
5.0,"These are well-made, good looking and comfortable. An inside zipper makes these easy to get on and off and the subtle stud detailing around the top of the boot is a nice touch.<br />Great quality leather but the all-day comfort is what really makes these stand out above other similar boots. They are my go-to boots and I love wearing them."
5.0,"Son bastante oscuras!! Pero son fashion, me encantan."
5.0,Soooo cuteeee but turns my finger green
5.0,"Using my husband's account. I love, love, love this dress! I got it for my birthday and I love the fit and feel.

5.0,"I buy, use and lose a lot of sunglasses, and this brand is by far the ones I now use the most. They‚Äôre so versatile, I use them throughout the winter for xc skiing and snow biking then take them right into spring and summer for cycling, running and kayaking.  Love the option of colors also and the reasonable price point means I don‚Äôt have to hate myself too much when I lose a pair."
5.0,Arrived on time. Great product.
5.0,Love the soft leather
5.0,The genuine article

5.0,"I love the blue velvet, received so many compliments! It's comfy and stylish! I ordered a large; I wanted to wear with leggings. I'm wearing a size 10, large fits nicely."
5.0,comfortable and versatile can be dressed up or down. I'm 5'5 and they're a little long so good for people with long legs or a little taller
5.0,"This blouse is gorgeous! The fabric is beautiful and the printing is nice. After reading reviews, I added sizes as suggested. I should have gotten my true size. It was my fault for ordering the wrong size so I am keeping it but sure wish I had ordered a medium. Love it!"
5.0,Love this bag! Durable but lightweight.
5.0,"Been using the same jar for two years. Makes my boots look brand spanking new every time I use it. I use this on my LL Bean Katahdin boots by Original Chippewa.<br /><br />MY ROUTINE: give it a real rub with both your finger tips and a cloth, then give your boots a generous 24 hours to sit, then use a brush to remove the debris/access and a final buff with a cloth (preferably a microfiber cloth). Spray with a weather proofer afterwards--I use the Red Wing spray that pairs with this oil."
5.0,I have had issues with other silicone bands but this one hasn‚Äôt given me a rash. It‚Äôs comfortable & easy to clean plus it‚Äôs cute
5.0,Loved these earrings! Super light weight. I might make them shorter for every day wear. Super happy with the product.
5.0,"Strong, secure, and colorful for quick locating luggage. Used for international travel and they were awesome."

5.0,Love the metallic look- very cute
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful, wish my stubborn child would have been walking already but this dress is amazing"
5.0,"Things I love: 1. Warm, 2. They're long so they stay tucked in under the jacket, 3. The zipper. The zipper is nice and long making the mittens easy to get on and off but also easy to open them up for drying. I wish I could find these mittens in a larger size!"
5.0,"Like the style, feels well made.  Stiff at first, but loosens up after a few uses.  And, best of all, great price."
5.0,Nice and thick.  Very warming.  Fit is possibly a little large but not excessively so.  More too long than too large.
5.0,"I absolutely love these earrings!  You can't get this size anywhere.  They are beautiful,  well made and very affordable.  Stainless steel is the best and they are light.  Shipping was fast also. Sabina (San Antonio)"
5.0,This is the same item we found in DC but couldn‚Äôt fit in our luggage. Glad to find in online and have it waiting for us when we arrived home.

5.0,"Easily dressed up or down. Great for the office or any LBD event. Stretchy and light, but didn‚Äôt show bumps."
5.0,The fit was great fit and looked great as well on my daughter. Very elegant.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:5ab640eedf4cf5c6de31f695606366]] Great packaging and it arrived early!!! It‚Äôs so cool and working like a charm; I‚Äôm excited for a few Halloween parties & other events
5.0,Gorgeous in person plus a pouch. Beautiful with my dress.
5.0,Very soft fabric. Fits well. Washes well.
5.0,&#34;Wonderful item! My grandson loved them! Well made! These are adorable and safe! Velcro closure!&#34;
5.0,Seemed to be fine. They were a little snug near my knee but otherwise fine.
5.0,"Super cute!!!!! Fits poerfectly. I am 5'3&#34;, 210 lbs. I ordered a XXL and ii fits perfectly. Love the vibrant color. Material is super comfy."
5.0,Exelent very nice
5.0,You can always depend on lucky quality very satisfied
5.0,Exactly what I was hoping for! Works perfect!
5.0,"I normally have reactions to metals other than surgical steel. I needed these to replace older ones.  No reactions. Just know that they are smaller than you think, so get out the ruler and check how big they will be. 3mm ball is very tiny and hard to screw in, but it‚Äôs more comfortable to wear in cartilage piercings."
5.0,"I love the size, first of all.  And that they are a very fine lightweight cotton.  I have one that I‚Äôve owned for many many years and could never find more.  I couldn‚Äôt be happier."
5.0,"great fit, no pinching. beautiful colors."
5.0,"My daughter has had these, as well as another set from the same company! They are cute little earrings and the screwbacks are fantastic for little ones!"
5.0,Great fit and well made. My only complaint is that the velcro on the back isnt long enough for the name plate
5.0,I like it but this is small ...
5.0,Easily molded to fit the foot.  Stopped the complaining about sore feet.  ;)  Handsome style for a man.  Good value.
5.0,Bought the leotards for my granddaughters and they looked adorable in them. They fit very well also
5.0,"I am a very picky person when it comes to hats. I've bought hundreds over the years and most I ended up only wearing a couple times before I tossed them on a shelf in the top of the closet.<br /><br />That being said, let me tell you, this hat is good if not great. I liked the way it looked so I thought I'd give it a shot. Every time I put it on, I forget about it being there until someone compliments me on it. It fits great. It is probably a mid height rise so it's not some tall and deep old school trucker hat and it isn't some limp-wristed shallow hat either. It has a nice rise to it, bordering on perfection IMO. I don't wear those lame flat brimmed caps and need my brim to have some shape. I spent about 30 seconds shaping it like I wanted and it kept it. You don't have to keep messing with it.<br /><br />The embroidery looks great. The white stitching accents it well. The breathable fabric does actually breathe. It's a black hat and in the bright sun my head doesn't get too hot. The band inside is somewhat elastic and stretches some but my head is about a 7 1/4 or a little bigger. That band is very comfortable, doesn't itch, and doesn't leave pressure marks on my forehead when I take the cap off.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say about it other than, after having written this, I think I'm going to order another one to keep on stand-by should something unforseen happen to this one. At this point it'd be like losing my best friend."
5.0,great quality I think it's a little over price but what you see is what you get
5.0,"Thick and sturdy.  Might be tight for large heads, but they stay in place and absorb lots of sweat.  Wash on the &#34;warm&#34; setting, and hang to dry."
5.0,The dress is so beautiful just like what I expected. Great quality!!üëçüëçüëç
5.0,Love the dress. Fit perfectly. Material was not thick but not too thin either. It was soft and nice to wear. Shows off the curves. Good buy. Value for money. Receives many compliments when I wore it to work.
5.0,used them for cupcake decorations for halloween and everyone loved them! great quality for the price and super cute too!
5.0,"Worked well for my Vivosmart HR.  If i didn't know what the original looked like, I wouldn't see a difference in this replacement.  The original seems slightly better quality.  Still very happy (I was using a pony tail holder).  I followed another reviewer's advice and ordered the 16 mm for my 18 mm watch band. Perfect. If it was bigger, probably wouldn't hold the strap as well.  Went on super easy too."
5.0,My friend literally jumped and down she was so happy with it. It‚Äôs beautiful. Very efficient design and well made.
5.0,"Being a curvy girl, it is rare that anything fits right of out the box but this looks custom for me.  Typically a size 14/16, I ordered a 3X  and crossed my fingers that it would hold my 38DDD top. This dress is well made, top portion is lined, and the fabric has some give.  It isn't tight nor is it loose.  Wish the bottom was lined too but it isn't see-thru so I won't have to mess with a slip. Considering wearing a petticoat under so a slip (or wishful lining) would have made this dress absolutely perfect."
5.0,My niece loved this outfit as a true star wars fan would and it fits her perfectly.
5.0,"Beautiful hankies, small and dainty."
5.0,I got these for my 18 month old daughter.<br />I wanted something that doesn‚Äôt slip off or she can easily take off.<br />The sole isn‚Äôt very thick but that‚Äôs also the reason she can walk in them and not lose balance or have them shift under her feet.<br />I love that they cover her ankles and long pants can even be tucked into the boot.<br />I love that when I take them off I can feel how warm & toasty they are.
5.0,needed to complete set of jewelry
5.0,"This is the second pair of slippers I bought for my husband.  He wore his first pair out by wearing them outside doing yard work.  It took a couple years to wear them out but there was no question  of what to buy, when I had to replace them.  My slippers I bought myself are still going strong!<br />PLUS  They come in wide widths!  A big plus for someone who needs it!!!"
5.0,Stylish and comfortable!! My husband loved them.
5.0,The earrings as are beautiful! Came packaged nicely in a velvet bag for storage. Came with the metal backs and also the silicone backs which is great for my daughter! Love them! Pictures don't do them justice!
5.0,This is gorgeous! I love the clasp and the weight of the necklace. It was a gift and she loved how easy it was to use the clasp. It is also strong enough to keep the necklace on. Recommend this!
5.0,"I got this for my 14 year old niece, she loved it :) She put it on (of course with assistance) with a smile :)"
5.0,Quick ship great value!
5.0,Absolutely amazing! Buy them!
5.0,I'm 5.7 and 140 lb.  I usually order M but based on reviews I ordered one size up L and it fits me perfectly.  The length is about 2 inches below the knee which is fine for the office.
5.0,"Loved it, perfect for my NEW GREAT GRANDSON!"
5.0,"I live in very sunny, high altitude climates (Colorado and New Mexico).  The shirt is perfect for lightweight, year round outdoor activities."
5.0,"I love this pin & the statement it makes. I do agree with a prior review, it would‚Äôve made more sense to have the boxing glove facing up, but it‚Äôs still a awesome pin."
5.0,Gorgeous quality and design. A perfect fall/winter wrap in the house or out.. people don't stop complimenting it.
5.0,I love this! So cute and I wear it constantly.
5.0,Exactly as described and you cant beat the price!
5.0,my necklace came in a cute box an just as shown. I love it. I will defiantly buy from Duman again.
5.0,"Cute outfit, pleased with it"
5.0,Love it!! Got an XS in dark green color. I‚Äôm only 5 3 so it‚Äôs really long on me but I tied a knot on one side and it hung beautifully!! Gold hoop earrings with a jean jacket!! So cute!
5.0,Bigger than what I thought but I absolutely  love it.
5.0,this dress fit me as expected! I will be buying more from this seller! it's fancy and will be great just to wear on a normal day. my boyfriend loves how it looks as well :)
5.0,This review is based on the ease of putting it together and the looks and span of the umbrella which is all great. I haven‚Äôt used it yet although I have opened it and adjusted to different settings. So far I am very happy and like the blue color. I also purchased the base for it.
5.0,"This top can be dressed up or down, looks fresh and crisp and is flattering."
5.0,It looks so cute and the quality was better than i thought.
5.0,My son loved the shoes
5.0,I absolutely ADORE this mousepad.  Not only do all 3 of these chi's look like my own but the quality is superb!  It's a very heavy and thick material.  The coloring is perfect....just as pictured.  Safe quick shipping.  Love this purchase!
5.0,"I usually size up in panty hose, but not necessary with these ~ they are very stretchy, pull up great, not tugging or stretching, so no destroying before you even get them up, lol.  And they hold their color great!!  Great fit, good price, really good quality.  Very pleased."
5.0,Great top.Nice and long and soft. Not for winter unlesss layering.vivid color
5.0,Amazing product.  So much like an old fashioned moccasin...wonderfully flexible and comfortable for small feet.  You can't have enough of these....and the kids don't outgrow them as fast as hard soled shoes!!  Super bonus for bigger kiddos.
5.0,"looks as pictured, runs a tad on the small side, but i love it."
5.0,Colorful and well-made. Was surprised to see two layer effect rather than just a stamping
5.0,Love everything about them
5.0,Material is great. But the large size is small.  It fits women with small waistline<br /> I got the large but does not fit around the waistline.
5.0,This is soft and sexy. I love the lace around the small slits it accentuates the thigh area. The straps are snug and able to withstand a little tugging. The top lace near the breast area is stictched nicely so as not to tear or come apart in the wash. I am surprised once again that this product is so well put together considering the price. This is the 3rd item I have purchased from this company and will continue to purchase provided the pricing remains low. If you are looking for sexy at affordable prices this is it. Yes you can find some cheaper but I promise you will not be happy with those other products. This is a great buy and super sexy. It is long enough to cover as my husband says &#34;all ya business&#34; :)
5.0,I LOVE this dress so much!<br />Fits great! I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh 140 pounds<br />The fabric is so soft!!
5.0,My school loved it!  I bought this as my kindergarteners were studying dinosaurs and I thought they‚Äôd get a kick out of this!  Turns out it was a hit with everyone!  Fit well and pockets-always a bonus!
5.0,Super soft and cozy socks with a cute print! I gave three pairs as Christmas presents and kept two for myself.
5.0,"I first purchased for working out; but they are just the most perfect ‚Äúall-purpose‚Äù shorts. Great for running errands, lounging around the house, working out, and for those hot summer nights when you don‚Äôt want to go in the house!"
5.0,I was looking for a pair of aviator glasses and these are perfect. Very light and comfortable to wear. They have held up very well this summer and on my cruise.
5.0,"I absolutely love this product! It really enhances my breast size by a lot!! I really love it because it save me so much money!!. I was so happy when a I received it, and the case is adorable!! I want to order the other color too, and will definitely recommend to all my friends and family. It doesn't slide, or feel fake. It gave me the shape and full size my dress needed. I looked great and nobody noticed anything except thay, &#34;I looked great!&#34;."
5.0,My kid loves this! It feels well made and looks cool!
5.0,Totally cute and adorable. Soft cotton and great colors.
5.0,"Bello,elegante"
5.0,cute and fancy
5.0,One of the best wallets I've ever owned!  Thank you
5.0,This was larger than I expected but I was pleasantly surprised. I initially intended to use it for my pens and pencils and highlighters for my Bible study but hardly any of them would fit in. So I decided to try it for a makeup bag and it was perfect. Holds my eyeliner and eye products and small brushes and plenty of room for my miscellaneous makeup products in the base. Worked out perfectly.
5.0,"Good selection of colors for dress clothes.  Traditional.  Quality is above average, nit great but acceptable for the price paid.  They have gone through a couple washings and have held up well."
5.0,Best value for your money. These pieces are all so cute and match lots of outfits. Very light weight. I recommend wearing the earring backs as they easily slip off your ear.
5.0,Very fun and comfortable look!
5.0,"Just the right weight for walking, running or working out."
5.0,Fits great and so cute. Made well. Great to top off my Halloween costume!
5.0,I bought as a Christmas gift for my sister and wanted to keep it for myself. I was so soft and cozy!
5.0,A little short but a good fit
5.0,"This set is very soft. It‚Äôs lightweight yet keeps you super warm in the cold winter months. I love this just lounging around the house, very cozy.<br />I ordered size Large and am going into my 3rd trimester of pregnancy it still fits comfortably."
5.0,"This is very stylish, love it."
5.0,"This stood the test of a day out biking in rainy Amsterdam. And indeed, kept my torso pretty dry!<br /><br />The bright yellow is not going to win you any fashion competitions...BUT...it is nice to have that extra layer of visibility on a rainy day.<br /><br />Plus, plenty of pockets!"
5.0,Great hat! Was for my dad and he loves it
5.0,"There was some creepy snowmen ‚õÑÔ∏è in the pack, they looked like bizarre robot ü§ñ versions of snowmen. Besides those 2, the rest were very cute. They were individually packed, so easy to mail out or stick with other items."
5.0,"go up a size, but they're super cute and comfy."
5.0,"Very nice, I love"
5.0,"love, love, love!"
5.0,The wig is such good quality!! Way better than expected for the price! The kids love it!
5.0,"When I work up to super long rides, i expect these to save my ass."
5.0,Fascinada con este vestido a mi hija le gust√≥ mucho y quiero decir que es la mejor compra que he hecho la tela es muy suave y la talla es la correcta üëå‚ù§
5.0,I purchased this set for my boyfriend and he truly love them and I will be getting him some more
5.0,My grandfather loved this
5.0,It fit me fine but I am not big.  5'2&#34;.  Size 6-8.
5.0,Love this.  Very nice
5.0,Well made and adorable.
5.0,Beautiful set! Could not be happier!
5.0,Looooove this!!! So comfy!!
5.0,Great quality and very cute.
5.0,These are my new favorite pair of workout capris...I will be purchasing a few more.
5.0,Can not wait to wear this
5.0,"They look jus like the picture and are very soft and fluffy, love that I'm 9-10 in womens and they actually fit comfortably. Will buy again in a different color. Price is unbeatable."
5.0,Bought this for a 8 year old birthday present (HP fan).  Great quality and so cute!
5.0,Packaging is greatÔºåAnd it's perfect
5.0,"Nice quality, flattering pair of sunglasses.  The quality is shown in the materials and fit of these glasses.<br />Slim frame outlien similar to a rayban like style.  99.9% polarized lens make a difference in viewing.  A soft easy visual view.<br /><br />These are really lightweight.  Fits my face really nicely without fidgeting or falling on my nose.<br />The lens don‚Äôt fully cover my eyes but offer a nice coverage.<br /><br />Really happy with these, they have been great summer glasses.  My goal is to keep them nice and for years to come.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful.  If so could you please click ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù below?  Many thanks"
5.0,Just what i was looking for...
5.0,"I have large artisan pins that I‚Äôve been waiting YEARS to wear as a proper pendant‚Ä¶I‚Äôve used multiple products to no avail, but I‚Äôve finally found a winner!<br /><br />The back disk spins to accommodate either a horizontal or vertical pin.  Also, of note, for your larger, heavier pins, you may have to use multiple converters so that the pendant doesn‚Äôt tilt or slide.<br /><br />I wear my pins on a silver slide collar and each one looks beautiful.  Additionally, the converters aren‚Äôt visible on any of my broaches, so the pendants appear to be suspended which is exactly the look that I‚Äôve been looking for!<br /><br />Buy with confidence..."
5.0,"My daughter has super sensitive ears, and these earings have been a god send! No irritation at all. She loves them. Highly recommended"
5.0,"Love this shirt.  Quality is VERY nice.  Ordering another!<br />Fabric is great quality and very soft (60% polyester, 35% rayon, & 5% spandex).<br />Nicely stitched and finished.<br />Love the length and slits in the sides.<br />Only caution to be aware of (and this is not a 'negative') -- The sleeves are made more like a bat wing type.  (It's not a separate sleeve that's sewn into the body.)  When I first put this on, it looked big on me (bc of the way the sleeves fit under the arm) -- but the body fits perfectly.<br />I do love it -- It is VERY comfy, and I'm ordering another!<br />I'm 5'9, just under 150 lbs and have a small waist.  The Medium is a perfect fit for me."
5.0,This is a gorgeous dress!! I have gotten so many compliments. You don't have to wear a slip but I did keep my shaper on. the fabric clings a little but is not tight.
5.0,"A beautiful set!! I love the chain of the necklace, is so different and elegant."
5.0,I love the dress. It is very pretty and feminine. Great flounce! I wish the material was a little thicket but that's just me. If you like very light material is awesome. Great for summer days. I just wish it was a tiny bit thicker because it is so delicate I feel I need to hand wash it in polite to make it last rather thank just washing in perminate press. Other than that it is beautiful.
5.0,Love then!
5.0,"This is a super cute light weight crew neck with a little bit do stretch.  If you want to fit loose like the picture, I‚Äôd size up.  I normally wear a small, but ordered a medium and it fits great (slightly loose as pictured)."
5.0,Great  Detail  Cant Really tell time  good but great it came  eralyier then expcdted
5.0,Great on my Daniel Green House shoes (slippers) smooth sole
5.0,excellent just as picture stated
5.0,"I was hoping these were the same as the ones that my daughter got put in when she had her ears pierced at the mall, and they were. She and I both have sensitive ears, and these 24K gold filled ones don't irritate our ears at all. She kept losing her other earrings so I thought these would work better. She can leave a pair in until she's tired of the color, then switch them. No need to take out at night or for showers."
5.0,"Unfortunately, I returned the 5.11 Tactical Taclite Pro Pants because the length was excessively long. I normally wear a 31-32 length depending on the brand and cut of the pants. The length of these pants was more on order of a 34 and hung well below the heel of both my boots and shoes (including hiking and exercise shoes). That said, the quality of the pants appeared to be top notch and the color (TDU Khaki) was exactly as I expected. When my size comes back in stock I will order a pair that's one size/length shorter than I normally wear and see that fixes the length issue."
5.0,I actually bought this skirt for a decorative mannequin in my home office and it looks fabulous!  I'm very happy with it and would definitely recommend.
5.0,"Good quality for the money, fits as expected and comfortable to wear"
5.0,"Beautifully made, terrific fit, great compliments when worn.......love love love."
5.0,Love it! Saving for Halloween!
5.0,"Cute little dress, bought for Wednesday Adams costume but I loved the fit and would consider wearing to work with flats!"
5.0,Fabulous! The Beatles beanie was a part of a concert where performers wore Beatle beanies. This particular style stood out! It was Fab! Thank you!
5.0,"such a piece of craft an design, recomend it!"
5.0,These are a great base layer.
5.0,TEACHER GIFT
5.0,Is definitely for a small or medium face<br />Great for using mask for long periods of time.<br />I can easily do a full strenuous workout with it.<br />I double mask when I‚Äôm at the gym. It makes breathing very comfortable.
5.0,Yes I like it especially the color.
5.0,"Living in northern California now, I get a lot of comments about my bright orange hat. It's a conversation starter every time. Hat is SO comfortable with a sharp embroidered design!"
5.0,Perfect size and beautiful color!  Have wanted some tanzanite earrings for some time now and these are perfect.  The color is a nice cross between a blue topaz and amethyst.  Love them!
5.0,Work great for a 4 year-old's high tops.  I didn't lace them all the way to the top because she had a hard time getting her foot in.  But works great laced midway up -- she can put them on and the shoe stays put!
5.0,This dress is amazing. I am 5'3 155 lbs and ordered a large. It fit perfectly. The quality is also great. I would definitely order it again.
5.0,Super cute dress that looks just like the picture. It is a little short and runs a little small so be sure to size up but over great color and so perfect for summer.
5.0,Simple and covers while driving...nice and light on the arms
5.0,"A little pricey, no frills, but it served its purpose."
5.0,"This fabric is amazing! cool when it's hot, warm when it's cold. I am a sweater... these tee's keep me cool and comfortable, and are so light that you feel as if your wearing silk. Machine washable forever, colors won't fade, stitching is fine, tough and non-irritable. I have converted all my work tees to this product. I can not praise this product enough!"
5.0,BEAUTIFUL! But small<br />smaller than 1/3 of my finger.<br />They advertised it as bigger
5.0,Best shoe for my sore feet. Exactly what I needed with the arch support.
5.0,I paired this blouse with a bank pair of slacks with heals for a work meeting. Gold necklace and gold earrings dressed this up even more
5.0,"This is a very comfortable dress.  It fits except for the fact that I am only 5' 1&#34; it is too long.  I must hem it, even to wear with heels.  It is very comfortable, though."
5.0,"Really comfy, great material not a cheap feeling material."
5.0,"These are comparable to my Enso rings for a fraction of the price! Fit well, don't stretch out, fun colors."
5.0,Love the shirt!! So soft and arrived so quickly! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,Omg this is a nice 2 piece I don't workout i just wear it outside it hugs all my curves I got the black and blue one and the pink one im 165 to 170 lbs a large fits me just right
5.0,"Sizing: I usually wear a size 7 in pants, but my tummy has gotten rather flabby and I‚Äôm currently in a size 9. I ordered the size Medium, and it seems to fit correctly.<br /><br />This shapewear is silky and comfortable, and it is similar in height to my Spanx. I really like how the panty area on the Camellias hi-waist brief is lighter than the rest of it since I don‚Äôt need the support in that area. This also helps to keep me cooler, especially since we‚Äôre starting to have warm weather. The waist has the same type of sticky material (silicone, I think) that keeps it up as my Spanx. This one has not rolled down or left me feeling like I constantly need to readjust or pull it up. The quality is quite nice: no loose threads and seams are stitched well. I have washed this in a lingerie bag on a cold cycle and hung to dry several times without any problems.<br /><br />This shapewear offers good control/support of my tummy. It also helps alleviate some of my lower back pain because it reminds me to have good posture. I don‚Äôt have any unsightly panty or waist lines, although some fabrics do tend to not glide over it as well as others (just like with my other shapewear products). This brief does not have the hook and eye fasteners at the crotch so it does have to be pulled down to use the restroom. I feel that I am getting moderate to firm control with this product, but not as much control as with the maximum control shapewear that I have. Overall, it is more comfortable than my Spanx, silkier, and lighter weight in the panty area. I would recommend it for moderate control.<br /><br />I received this shapewear for free in exchange for my honest review. I did not receive any other compensation, and I am not obligated to write a favorable review. I have used this product myself, and all words in this review are my own."
5.0,"These are absolutely stunning. The back screw is tiny, but careful work puts it perfectly in place for an adult ear.  We love screw on posts.  They hold the piercing open between dress-ups."

5.0,Great shorts but the fit is a little small.

5.0,"As per other reviews, I sized down from my normal S to an XS, and it was perfect! I cannot talk enough about how much I adore this dress, from the functionality and practicality of the pockets, to the quality of the fabric, and just how it fits/looks. This is such an amazing dress and I highly, highly recommend it if you're looking for something more dressy, and even if you want a nice dress for an event or to wear to class."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:787d2d6a4e6ed84836d6c52a0be84088]] I wear it every day and it‚Äôs a nice accessory for any outfit, and it keeps my energy calm"
5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for.  It is roomy enough for a phone and keys however, it is made of lightweight material.  I live in a temperate climate and don't really need a knit scarf for walking.  The price and color were great so it was perfect for my needs."

5.0,"The blue one with the intricate pattern arrived exactly as pictured. It is very vibrant and far less sheer than I expected. I got several compliments on it right away. If you add a belt or sash it makes a nice summer dress. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù 185 lbs and if I were any shorter it would drag, but it fits properly. Side slits end above my knees. V neck ends a hand and a half from my clavicle. The arm holes are big enough to require an undershirt but not obnoxiously large. I am very happy with my purchase"

The quality is great, they're the perfect width, not quite skinny ties but slim enough they don't look bulky with a slim fit shirt. I never thought ties would excite me but these did. Can't wait to look extra fresh at work.<br /><br />Will likely order some other as well."
5.0,I am 5'3 and this dress was too short on me. Like my butt cheeks were gonna show

I bought the navy and it is perfect. The fabric is perfect like a medium weigh and I did not need to wear a slip underneath, because the fabric was thick enough to not see through to my under things.

5.0,"A bit of bedazzle for my red, slingback pumps; perfect! Arrived in a timely fashion, well and safely packaged.  JRT"
5.0,They look just like the pictures and they are so cute and easy to put on.  Such a great variety pack to get if you can‚Äôt get your nose pierced but still think septums are cute or if you‚Äôre trying to decide what looks good on you before you do.  The styles that I thought would look the best on me I‚Äôm kinda on the fence about and the ones that I thought I wouldn‚Äôt like I actually like the best haha so I‚Äôm glad I got the variety pack instead of buying one or two I thought I‚Äôd like.

5.0,"these are my favorite sunglasses, they are super durable and very dark! I always get compliments on them!"
5.0,"These are too adorable!<br />I went through and read all the reviews that I could find on hot chocolate designs shoes before ordering. One common theme that I noticed was complaints that they ran big.<br />I went to hot chocolate designs website and measured the inside of a pair of my daughter's shoes that fit well and ordered based off of that. These arrived fitting perfectly! For reference, she wears a size 6 toddler in most brands but wears a 7 in old Navy shoes. I ordered the size 7 for her in these.<br />The design of these is awesome, the buckle is a little tricky but should loosen and get easier to use over time and they appear to be really well made.<br />Bonus - my toddler loves them, which is nice, she's pretty picky about her shoes lately lol"

5.0,Great fit and graphic work!
5.0,"Super cute little wrist strap. My phone case had the loop for the string on the side but I‚Äôm sure you can also fasten it to the speaker/charging port holes. Easy to clean, solid material, decorative but not too much. Made of string not an elastic/stretchy material, kind of ‚Äúone size‚Äù if that helps? Either way, it‚Äôs exactly what I pictured. Love it!!"
5.0,Excelellent

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:41cffdd81a8744b2d85659467c706283]] The shoes are my new go-to combat boots! They are sooooo comfortable to walk in, so I could wear them to the mall, a night out, to a gallery, etc. I don't mind standing in them because they feel so good and the chunky heel is so trendy right now.<br /><br />They're very breathable, so while they are boots, they don't make your feet hot and they have this stretchy material so they are incredibly easy to put on and take off without having to undo the laces."
5.0,"Love the color - true dark sage color.  Bigger than I expected which is a good thing.  Lots of zippered pockets - LOVE zippered pockets!  Then once you've put everything away in its own zippered compartment you can zip the top - can you tell I love zippered pockets?.......Anyhow.  I also really like that there's a long shoulder strap included to attach to the bag and make it longer.  This is a perfect carry-on purse (about to take a trip, such a plus)"
5.0,This item was packaged to showcase the beauty of the products within.

5.0,I'll start with im 5ft5in 240lb and losing. I'm proportioned well carrying only a medium amount of extra weight in my belly (loose measurement on my waist is 44in at belly button) I got the size I wear in my normal leggings from other brands and they fit perfectly and my favorite is they are snug against my ankles like regular leggings. I hate the kind that are loose on the ankles so this sold me to get more pairs. I've done squats in them and they did not rip nor did I hear cracking from the seams. Super soft as well.
5.0,"They were fantastic for my husband. They were a little too loose for me, but I have a small head. Probably the child‚Äôs would be fine for me"
5.0,It was perfect for my little girl to be in my wedding!!
5.0,These are my favorite pjs.  The fit is perfect and the fabric is very soft and comforting.
5.0,"Fantastic Healing properties,I wear it while sleeping; copper has always been known to remove poisons out of the body, not medication but impurities. I also liked the fact with the open clasp its adjustable and slides on/off my index finger easily. On the other hand I did not like the green tint it left on finger, but I suppose that's the poison being drawn out."
5.0,Matte silver! Long and thin! Love them. So versatile
5.0,I wear this ring every day and it is one of my favorites.
5.0,My neice loves this cute little smart watch. Its perfect for her and shes 7 even my 4 yo plays with it sometimes pretty easy to navigate and.cute can take up to about 40 pics before its full but you can buy a sd card for it which is neat. All around great gadget for $40
5.0,Simply lovely. I wear them on my wrist every day!
5.0,"They do the job. I needed some super slim readers to be able to see close up but also that wouldn‚Äôt obstruct the rest of my view. I use them for inspecting beehives and I have to be able to see the tiny eggs down in the cells. I wear them under my bee suit, thus I can‚Äôt be taking them on and off. They definitely do the trick."
5.0,"Very Pretty - followed the sizing chart and it was a little smaller than expected, but still pretty and worked."
5.0,"I measured my eyeglasses and these sun glasses fit over them perfectly, as if they were one unit.  They are well designed and made.  I have used them in full sun conditions and they did excellent.  I am pleased and have no complaints."
5.0,This shirts is so cute and comfy!!! Definitely recommend.
5.0,LOve it
5.0,"I'm 5'7"" with an athletic build, and the medium is perfect for me. I wear these tank hoodies for my boxing classes. Good breathable material, but keep it away from velcro because it snags and pills the mesh."

5.0,"Love this item, it fit's on a big man's wrist."
5.0,"These are the real deal! I have bought a couple of nose piece & ear sock knock offs for 2 of my sweep m-frame glasses purchased in the mid 90's, they are terrible!! The imitation nose pieces just don't stay on & fall of easily. I found these & just installed them, holy cow, what a difference. I'm glad I found these, just ordered 2 more pair for back up's when my new ones wear out. Thanks for a great & honest product!!!!"

5.0,I love these they are wonderful and look awesome when they are in.  i got a lot of compliments on these.  awesome!!!!!
5.0,Ordered this for a Paracord Bracelet. Could not have asked for more perfect sizing. The charm is solid and the jump ring is sturdy. I'm hoping my gift will be well-received.
5.0,I love it I needed a size down I'm 4'7 so I had it altered in the front. I had a small train in the back it was gorgeous we'll buy another color. The material was soft  and comfy for folks with sensitive skin.

5.0,It was very comfortable.  But I had to return it because it was too large for me.
5.0,"Where to begin. The glasses are excellent! Far exceeding my expectation! I took them out on the Harley and they worked great&#62; they didn't jump around as i was cruising along , they never fogged up on me because they have these nice little vents along the top. Super idea! They block the sun and you can see clearly. Whoever made these put a lot of care into making them. They come in a nice box and inside that box is a case for the glasses, a really good case too! Inside that case is a little card you can test the polarity and a cleaning cloth! I am really happy with these glasses! I will recommend these to all my rider friends! Thank you for reading this!"

5.0,"THE CORRECT ITEM FITS WELL ,"
5.0,"It took a while to arrive as the slippers were sent out directly from China, but it was worth the wait. I ordered the pink one.  The color is true to the picture, a very pretty pastel pink.  I like that each of the slippers is made out of a single piece of material, and that means easy cleaning!  The size though, I wanted 36 for my mom, but the smallest available was 37/38.  I ordered them anyway and figured if they were too big for my mom, then I would wear them, but they actually fit my mom,  From what I see, though they looked like a size bigger than her normal size, because the rim was raised around the edge, so my mom could still wear them comfortably. I would suggest to buy them a size bigger than your normal size because of the raised rims."
5.0,"these glasses are SO cute. i love how they look on me. they're a little big, but overall, I LOVE EM. would 100% recommend."

5.0,"Note: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />I was contacted by the seller to review this shirt for them and I love it. Now, these shirts are more for athletic built people because they are tight to the body, however I use it as an undershirt. It keeps sweat away from my dress shirts or regular t-shirts. If you have a thing body or athletic-built body, this shirt would look great on you. It's stylish and the v-neck gives it a great touch. I would recommend this shirt to anyone to where is as regular shirt or undershirt.<br /><br />If for some reason my opinion changes about this shirt, I will come back and update my review."
5.0,Worked well in our trip to alaska
5.0,It's hard to find an apron that is big enough but this one is just fine. Long tails to be able to tie it and big enough to cover me. I like the pockets too. Now my clothes are covered when I get Gung ho in the kitchen.
5.0,Great Price and Product!
5.0,These are very nice pendants with an accompanying chain.  They are nickel free as well which was an important reason I choose this product over others.

5.0,Love the tie so much! My groom will look very handsome wearing it.
5.0,"Super beautiful, fits perfectly!"
5.0,"Really nice set of earrings, they look expensive and truly sparkle. All three are somewhat hypoallergenic, I could wear them for up to 24 hours and don't feel any itching or pain but after that I have to take them out because my ears start getting irritated. Good to wear for special occasions or everyday look."
5.0,Since my wife started wearing this necklace her headaches and migraines have gone away.

5.0,"I liked this dress more than I thought I would!  the purple color is as vibrant as shown, and the style looks exactly like the picture, even at a larger size.  Very flattering, and we all love pockets.  I plan to order the same dress in additional colors.<br />I'm usually somewhere between an XL and 1X - I ordered the XL and it was perfect."
5.0,"I love this bathing suit! The colors really pop. Ordered an XXL because I have a very long torso (5'9&#34; 190lbs), plus I'm curvy & one piece suits are usually not long enough for me. I probably would've been fine with the XL, but the XXL fits well so I'm happy with it."

5.0,[[VIDEOID:cb71b0e7191452a12e2e86942b98f60]] I like that this apron  is adjustable in size for going around either myself or my husband. It is a thick material and perfect for  me when I am working in my husbands wood shop. It has several different sized pockets on it and also a hook  for attaching my keys.

5.0,"Love it! Great price, fast shipping and I still have it! Great quality."
5.0,"Love this ring! They did a good job with the black detail. one thing to note, is the size 13 fits like a 12 or 12.5. If I would have bought the size 12 it would have been too tight."

5.0,I love all the ones I bought. I do wish the Schnauzer wasn't so small. It doesn't fit my house key. Says slim. Please make it regular size.
5.0,Love all these colors
5.0,"My teenage son asked for these and I didn't really know what they were but I went ahead and ordered them as a gift.  Complete score!  They are very versatile and while my son likes them for several ways he uses them while hunting or hiking, I like them for controlling my very long hair while jogging.  There are four colors included so ehile they coordinate you cant make a matchred set of accessories.  They arrived on time with no problems."
5.0,Good  quality
5.0,"I bought it for myself, but it was too small.  I gave it to my grandaughter, and she loves it!  I wish that it was made in true USA sizes."
5.0,This shoe horn is nicely made and very cool!  It makes the fact that I need a shoe horn at all  (after my hip surgery) feel less like a &#34;handicap&#34;.  It works super well and it's great fun to look at!
5.0,"Although I haven't been able to test whether it's completely waterproof, it's definitely water resistant so far. I bought this for a trip to Scotland, so I'm hoping it'll work for the weather there. It's really cute so it's one of my favorite coats. It's definitely not for weather below 20¬∞F unless you've got layers on underneath, but it's great for around 40¬∞F and damp weather. Based on other reviews I ordered a medium and it fit as expected."
5.0,Got these today and I cant say how pleased I am with these bands. Its great to be able to change bands to match my outfits. They definitely are high quality in terms of the material used and the colors are stylish. I must say I am pleasantly surprised!!
5.0,"Love mine so much, bought this for a gift"
5.0,"I purchased this watch for the tourbillion moon phase feature primarily and also for features which include leather strap, automatic mechanical, the automatic mechanism being shown on both the front and rear sides, and overall looks.  All these features at a very reasonable price.  I get many complements all the time on this watch."
5.0,"Love the light weight very soft material. Not see through. I ordered black. Will be a great romper to wear out. I am short with somewhat of a short torso and the elastic waist part comes down to my hips, which is what I was hoping for. It still comes a few inches above the knee."
5.0,"Liked very much, fit true to size. My husband likes the lined crocs the best, He also uses the basic croc in spring to fall."
5.0,I really love this dress because it seems to make me look taller than I am. It fits nice and is a great length.
5.0,Awesome quality! I love this ring! It fits and looks great!! The price couldn't be better!! I'd buy it a thousand times again!
5.0,"I loved everything about this bracelet! I purchased 3 of them. One for myself and the other two for my mother and sister. We all have one of the same, it was my mother‚Äôs day gift to them. The packaging was beautifully made. My sister and mom thought that the packaging was the gift. Lol."

5.0,Great fit.  Beautiful material.  Great craftsmanship.  Will be back!
5.0,"I am 5'4 and it comes up to right above my knees- size medium fit perfectly. It was also very comfortable. Just as a heads up, you will need a strapless bra that can be hidden. The one I had didn't work because you could see the sides of the cups since part of the front of the dress is mesh see through. I ordered another bra on Amazon and it works perfectly with it. Great quality at a great price!"
5.0,Very nice dress. Fits true to size.
5.0,These sun glasses prove one need not spend over $200.00 to get a very cool pair of shades. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat!
5.0,"Love it, cool for now like I wanted. But most of all I love it because if I drop an hot ash on it. I don't have a hole the size of a quarter. would like to find a warmer one for winter. That works and fit as great"

5.0,"Amazing<br /><br />I love these sunglasses! I waited a few days to try them out, it was cloudy.<br />They truly cut out the glare and &#34;blue rays&#34;....crisp and clear view. One day it clouded up quickly. These were awesome, even then. I wear prescription (light) sunglasses. I've been wearing these instead.<br />They're stylish and fun! I've had loads of compliments & people have asked where to buy them!<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.<br />I stand by the integrity of my review and was not influenced in any way."

5.0,This bag is just right for me! And so pretty. Nicely thin so it‚Äôs not heavy after I fill it. I really like it!
5.0,"I bought these mask because the ones I was using for the past couple of years were beginning to wear. The things I like about them include a solid nose wire that hugs the nose (which helps keep your breath from fogging up your glasses, the comfortable ear loops, and it fits my face. The one drawback (a minor one) is the fabric is a little rough on the skin. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with them."
5.0,High-quality and I love the look. My head measures 23 inches around and the large/Xlarge fits me perfectly.  I don't recommend wearing this hat in the summer. They don't breathe too well and would heat up your head pretty quick. Perfect for cooler temperatures.
5.0,I always order extre large this one is too big
5.0,Dislike non
5.0,We had a destination wedding and purchased these as wedding favors.  They were prefect.  The variety was great and everyone loved them.  The quality was astounding for the price.
5.0,Love this dress! It‚Äôs super lightweight and flowy so it‚Äôs perfect for summer. I originally ordered a 2X and it was a little too loose on me so I got a 1X and it fit perfect. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and it hit right at the knees for me.
5.0,Great top good quality fit as expected

5.0,Excellent very comfortable
5.0,Very good fitting and warm.
5.0,"Love these rain boots! Love the glitter look. They are high quality and durable. Only thing to mention is that they run a little small. My daughter wears a 5.5 shoe, I ordered the 6 but they barely fit. I exchanged for the 7s and they fit great with a little room to grow into."
5.0,I love this shirt and I got many compliments. I ordered one size up and it was a little big but allowed me to wear it with leggings. I would buy again and I do recommend.
5.0,My husband absolutely LOVES this hat. I got it for him for his birthday. Shipping was super fast also.<br />The quality is just awesome. It's not one of those cheap flimsy hats and the &#34;leather&#34; pieces actually feel thick and are securely attached. Ive yet to buy anything to keep the hats shape and yet it still holds its shape very well. It's a nice quality hat for the price. This has become one of his favorite hats.
5.0,"Fits just right, looks like the pics!"
5.0,Fits great! Legs are a little long but I prefer that!
5.0,Buy it! It‚Äôs cute and cozy !
5.0,"Bought it for my wife and she loves it, very soft and the color is vibrant"
5.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful dress fits just right I order a size 16 plus I thought it wasn‚Äôt going to fit because it look like it didn‚Äôt stretch at all but i was wrong the only part I didn‚Äôt like it was on the arms  area the sleeves are small but I really recommend it though
5.0,Just what I want
5.0,I bought this for my mother-in-law since it was her birth stone and she loved it. It‚Äôs simple but classy. It‚Äôs a little small but she is a petite woman.
5.0,Nice product. My wife use hers at least once per week during the last year.
5.0,Love the fit.  Style is perfect and fits nice and snug and comfortable.
5.0,I absolutely love it. It‚Äôs like an optical illusion. The material is great quality.
5.0,"Love the fabric, comfy, easy care"
5.0,It is very comfortable on the wrist. Lightweight and durable!
5.0,"This dress... so soft, so comfy! It's far too immodest to wear by itself, but it's perfect as a fall/winter slip. I'm 5'5"", US size 14/16, and the large dress hits a few inches above the knee and fits just right around the bust and shoulders. Will be ordering another for backup!"
5.0,"Looked cute, not too short or too long! Comfortable and great coastal grandma style!"
5.0,Very good product. I use it with a Samsung Note 8.
5.0,"I love the fabric and the fit, I would describe the fabric as a thick spandex. I received lots of compliments. I ordered a small, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 145lbs"
5.0,It was a birthday present!
5.0,Fits perfect with no gapping at the spaces near the buttons. There is some stretch to the fabric so it has a nice fitted look without bunching or binding. Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,"Bought this for a coworker who is set to retire next month.  She's only 48, so I thought the younger style of the bracelet would really suit her, but truth be told, I think any retiree, regardless of age would appreciate this cute bracelet.  For the price, it made such a unique and special gift that she really seemed happy with.  Well packaged and protected."
5.0,"Lovely skirt. I adore this brand and can never find it anywhere. I was shocked and thrilled to find it on amazon! It‚Äôs extra long, I‚Äôm 5 foot 9‚Äù and it‚Äôs long enough even for me. DO NOT DRY IT, it‚Äôll shrink like 4‚Äù, no joke. I only dry clean it but you can hand wash and hang dry too. Do not steam it either!"
5.0,"I love this little cuff, it's exactly what I was looking for for a good price."
5.0,works ban
5.0,Great quality ‚Äî I only sent it back because I wouldn‚Äôt be using it in the school play after all.
5.0,I absolutely love this duster! I ordered the burgundy color( it‚Äôs a darker burgundy then shown in picture online) I am 5‚Äô9 and it falls right at my knee. I weigh 150 pounds and the medium fits perfect. I do suggest that if you plan to wear a long sleeve shirt under the duster that you go up a size however it fits comfortably with a tank or short sleeve. The quality it nice and I definitely plan to order this duster again in a different color.
5.0,"I purchased this tunic in the Vertical Coral design.  It's a great summer tunic and I'm glad it's not sleeveless as not everyone likes to show off their arms.  I wear anything from 6-10 and purchased this in a Large.  It was a little roomy, but not so much that I was swimming in it.  Still need to shed about 9 pounds before I just try to maintain my weight.  Anyway, it's got the cute wacky hem that I like (somewhat like a handkerchief and somewhat like a sharkbite....both of which I love.  The design is not crazy and this will really go great with a black pair of jeans or leggings.  It's a simple lightweight tunic and I'm glad I have another option to wear this summer.  I hope I can figure out how to fit a long sleeve shirt underneath come the fall and winter.<br /><br />Note: I received a discount to purchase this item in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,Great gloves? Warm and comfy!
5.0,Love this band and the color!
5.0,"The chain is a little thin, but it is still beautiful and discreet."
5.0,I love this bracelet. I had the evil eye one  for more than 2 years before and I was prying a box open and I believe it unhooked it and it fell. Of course someone picked it up and didn't turn it in...I decided to get this one because its even more beautiful.
5.0,Wish it had snaps instead of buttons but otherwise it is a lovely long robe.
5.0,Worked well for my five years old. A little big but he didn't complain putting it on. His hands stayed warm.
5.0,Love this style. They fit over my glasses perfectly and are just the right shape. Would buy another pair when needed.
5.0,So cute! Mom loved it
5.0,My band had broken off. This was easy to install and is working great.
5.0,"ordered a large and its really tight, its fine for me but it seems to run small for a large"
5.0,very good and easy to put on
5.0,"I absolutely love this bathrobe.  It is warm and perfect for right after a shower.  It fits well.  However, it is not made the best.  The loop where the 'string' fits around the belt area broke one of the first weeks I purchased.  Not too big of a deal but an inconvenience.  Again, the loop at the top to hang the robe broke.  The robe is way too heavy to be hung from a tiny looop at the top.  Just be wary in buying."
5.0,I love this gown nice and long
5.0,I am in love with these! They are so comfortable and still have the look of dress pants. I will be ordering more!
5.0,Really comfortable underwear. The waistband was soft and felt like satin.
5.0,Very useful for people with a nickel allergy.
5.0,"OEF cap looks good, appears to be made well..."
5.0,I am a relatively big person and I normally wear a 3x shirt for the extra length...in these I would recommend a size down...Since theres no material on your shoulders it hangs a bit loose/lower than you would expect even with a large chest.<br />Very comfortable even when I get sweaty at gym. I wear one every time I go highly recommend
5.0,Great for winter days at ballet. A little more coverage and a bit higher of a neck than some other brands we have tried. This is our go to leotard for dance classes now. Does not cut of my little girl's legs or squeeze too tightly anywhere.
5.0,"I ear double extra large gloves so I was a little worried about the one size fits all aspect, but the went on fine and they keep my hands warm while using my iPad. Also, my screen stays cleaner, longer."
5.0,"Great purchase, fast service!"
5.0,"These tanks are just awesome ! Very smoothing. If you want slightly more compression, just order a size down, but these are so nice, I bought them twice !"
5.0,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

5.0,summer wear
5.0,Amazing Shoes
5.0,"Great suit!  I searched for weeks on multiple websites and Amazon did not let me down.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase of this swimsuit.  Tried it on as soon as I got it and like others have said, the bust is generously sized; maybe a touch disproportionate to the rest of the suit but not outrageously so.  The material is soft, seams looked great, and I didn't notice any thread popping sounds as I put it on as others had mentioned.  The sizing is funny, I ordered a 3x for the first time in my life.  I normally wear a 14 women's and I think this suit is perfectly sized for me.  The suit covers my bottom and the halter is very flattering.  Bought another retro-inspired suit for my daughter from cocoship and it's obvious they care about putting great affordable products out for consumers.  I personally love the Fulfilled By Amazon feature of this supplier also."
5.0,"Good as any tie maker in looks, style, color, quality."
5.0,I love it so much. My fianc√© got it for me as a gift and I wear it as a necklace ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,"Came quick, fits perfect. Just like samsung"
5.0,"This dress is really nice on!!!  I after reading the reviews I went up one size, I would suggest go up one size. The only negative would be because it is sequins it may irritate your arm.."
5.0,50% power and i shot out of bed quick.  i would like it to work within iphone alarm but with the customizability i can see why not but it should.  My wife hates my alarms to wake me up as i set multiple and snooze constantly.  i know this will help her and I on many levels.
5.0,"just for fun.  it is difficult to breathe in it.  perfectly sewn, stones in place.  beautiful.  pocket for charcoal filter."
5.0,Necklace really is wonderful. The Pearl looks great and the setting just added to it.
5.0,Extremely soft and very comfy. I‚Äôll definitely be buying more!
5.0,"This bag has several pockets and side pockets to keep wallet, keys and sunglasses handy.  The leather is very soft. Bag looks and feels like more expensive bags."

5.0,"It is a little heavy, but I this those. Amazing quality and look."
5.0,"Surprise for the hubby! Perfect fit, good quality material and fashionable for him!"

5.0,Super dress for kids.
5.0,"Perfect lightweight size and roomy, I did have to keep the straps together with a rubberband cause they're slippery and slide off my shoulder, put grippers under the straps and I woulda paid more for it."
5.0,I really liked all of these! What you see is what you get. They are pretty easy to put on and take off. I would recommend. I think it is a good deal for the price.
5.0,"Delivered quickly, good quality."
5.0,"Wish I would have gotten a size larger, but it‚Äôs well made and cute on"
5.0,"This dress is super cute, fit perfectly. You can wear it with a petticoat for some extra oomph, but it doesn't need it if you don't want to. Great for work and for going out."
5.0,Good looking and good quality.
5.0,"I wanted a larger bed so that I could carry my iPad Pro 12.9 inch tablet. I travel rather frequently and want easy access to phone/tablet/wallet.  They need to be quickly access with one hand, while safely stowed until needed.  Cross body  shoulder strap is necessary so I can have both hands free when needed for luggage/etc. Of course, I also need style, quality and his little bulk as possible.  The leather is soft and very similar to my Coach pebbled leather bag.  I  would have loved another compartment for receipt/documents.  Or use the back pocket cell phone access. I use the zipper pocket for wallet.  I would recommend this bag.  Can't beat it for the quality.<br /> UPDATE:  I had an issue with what appeared to be a part of the letter that had been damaged in production or shipping. I contacted the seller who was extremely responsive and replaced the bag entirely. They did not even want me to send back the bag with the small damaged area."
5.0,"This medium duty toolbag will hold two power tools and batteries, two accessory boxes, and other hand tools. The big mouth opening open with ease via a heavy duty zipper, that keeps all your tools dry and dust free. Plus, if your tool bag tips over in your trunk or back of you truck bed, you won't have tool all over, if closed properly."
5.0,"The shades are hefty, not some super cheap feeling/looking glasses. They work great and I always get compliments while wearing them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I lost my first pair of Shades while swimming in the ocean, and I had to order a new pair. The new pair I got had  problems with the molding on the arms of the sunglasses so that it wouldn't sit on your face properly and kind of hangs off your face to one side. I'm sure this was just a bad apple, but it really kind of upset me that I didn't get my item in the same shape that I did the first time."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:b4db7487152fca5e981cf939f19a3d85]] REALLY SOFT comfy top!!<br /><br />It is designed to be loose and flowy....if that is not your style size down at least one size.  I purchased the Large, and it fits me like an XL.  Probably should have gone with the Medium.  I am 5'6&#34;, 133lbs and 36C.<br /><br />Unique hemline is very flattering.<br /><br />Lacing at the top is really cute....I saw that some people had trouble with getting the lacing to lay flat.  WATCH THE VIDEO, as I show how to get it to lay properly.<br /><br />Fabric is super soft and drapey!<br /><br />Pink color is true to pic.<br /><br />Very pleased with purchase!<br />Promotional or discounted item provided for review purposes....5 stars for Vessos!<br /><br />Check out my video!"

5.0,"I bought this for my nephew as he is completely enthralled with Unspeakable on you tube. He loves to wear it, says it‚Äôs comfortable and really likes the colors. He‚Äôs 7."
5.0,These are great! My only problem was they are shorter than I thought but still fits great. I run in them all them time.
5.0,"Good quality, nice colors and not too heavy to wear with a sweater."
5.0,I am very happy with the overall quality of this product especially the fabric
5.0,I saw this shirt on an episode of Modern Family and had to have it! Just wish I would have kept all my old Journey concert T-shirts! But this is the next best thing. Also very soft and brightly printed!
5.0,"I liked the design, color of this bag. Comfortable and easy to carry."
5.0,"This skirt is so cute, soft, and fits just right. Don't second guess this purchase."
5.0,Beautiful Dress for my daughter... it fit her perfectly.
5.0,"I‚Äôve had one of my Army-issued Parachute Badges (with the two attaching pins in back removed) on my key ring since the middle 1950‚Äôs. I can distinguish no difference between that one and this one I bought from Amazon with the possible exception that the one I carried in my pocket for 61 years exhibits a little wear! Thanks a lot!<br /><br />Commo Section, Support Company, 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, Japan and Korea, June 1953 to May 1955."
5.0,It‚Äôs very flowy!  I love it. Just enough cover and it‚Äôs not too hot!

5.0,There is nothing to dislike. The product is great and is very nice. The company is very fast to respond to you if you have any problems.
5.0,Love love love this find fit perfect
5.0,I like the materials that it‚Äôs made out of very tough and durable. I use it for carting my iPad and chargers and of all things. There are lots of pockets and loops for various things to hook onto to. Very pleased with this product can‚Äôt say enough.
5.0,Runs  large.the washer and dryer will srink them some
5.0,I use these as an undershirt for my nursing uniform. Moisture wicking is moderate. Being a nurse can certainly compared to working out in some sense
5.0,"Just perfect fun attire alternative to &#34;Ugly&#34; sweater!  Yes, the sleeves are too long.  I'm 5'2&#34;, most are too long for me...these sleeves go beyond that.  I did hem them up a couple of inches before wearing.  I had a light, opened front red cardigan I wore with this and the sleeves kept creeping out longer, like they had a mind of their own.  I plan on taking another 5 inches off the sleeves so this doesn't happen again (hopefully)  I intend to wear with the cardigan, as I like the look on me, so even if I get the sleeves too short, they shouldn't keep growing out the cuffs!  (If they do, I'll be scared that they may be some kind of mutant life form).  Wore with jeggings, as it is way too short for this old gal to wear this short of a dress.  But I felt fun and festive!"
5.0,Simple and beautiful
5.0,"Somewhat large brim, but I love the sparkle."
5.0,Was a good buy!
5.0,easy and elegant
5.0,"Nice off-white shiny shoe for a great price. New and clean, just as described."
5.0,Great for my bikini photoshoot!!! But at the end of the day they broke. Defintaley worth the buy though!
5.0,These are gorgeous. Just as in the picture. Nice quality!
5.0,"Love this belt, worth every dollar. Lasted three years using it everyday for work."
5.0,Fits great looks great I'm 5'2 125 and the small is good

5.0,Looking hot in Quay this Spring/Summer.  Everyone loves these - lots of compliments.  I have a heart shaped face but any face can rock these.
5.0,"I received this at a discount , agreeing to leave a review. Very cute ! Well made...I would def order more"
5.0,Very nice combination of soft colors design and craftsmanship. Can be wear day or night.
5.0,Bought these in ankle length first in grey color. Liked them so well I bought the higher ones also i<br />n grey.  My wife has always bought gold toe socks for herself. Tried mine and went with black ankle length . We both love these socks now.
5.0,"I've had this purse ( I have the black one) for about 5 months now...I have to say it is my favorite purse! It is well made ...the quality is AWESOME!!!<br />The hardware , even the zippers are excellent quality (I have another leather purse that is not a Heshe bag and it came with plastic type zippers...ugh)<br />The lining is thick and durable and has a nice feel to it...The leather is high quality - has a good weight to it -nice soft feel, it softens even more as you use it.<br />The straps both the top straps and the detachable shoulder straps are well made as well , the only issue I had was with the shoulder strap I found it to be really long- I'm short and I had to punch a hole in it or the bag would hang down below my rear end LOL- After getting the hole in place I then have a ton  of extra strap kinda flopping loose. BUT that's just one problem that comes with being ...short.<br />The size of this bag is GREAT! I can fit all of my things in there and then some.<br />Live the design ! I just can't say enough good about this bag....Only thing is ..I now have my eyes on the purple and the red one ....maybe even the camel colored one ...."
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weight about 138. I wear a small to medium but more on the medium side as I don‚Äôt really like my pants to tight. I read the reviews and went with a small and so glad I did. A medium would have been way to big. They are super soft and I absolutely love the pockets. I got these for my friends and I to wear to a friends ugly sweater party. We wanted to stand out and that we did. We all loved the pants so much.
5.0,"I love the color and texture of this material! More like a canvas type material instead of cheap leather that is going to flake in a week. Soft and cushiony inside and has really cute criss cross elastics on top. My only complaint is that they are pretty slick when she‚Äôs walking in them. Overall, great value. Will definitely purchase again."
5.0,I would say order  size up. I normally get a small and ordered a medium and fits perfect.
5.0,This was as pictured and a perfect fit! Very Satisfied with this purchase!!
5.0,These were so cute!
5.0,"I appreciate so much fits in these.  They probably hold groceries it would require several of those plastic bags!  And, they are easier for the cashiers to pack my groceries."
5.0,beautiful scarf!!! i absolutely love it!
5.0,Great fit.  Nice design and colors.
5.0,Great for many items!<br />I used this to clean jewelry and silverware. Awesome product and so easy to use.
5.0,My daughter got so many compliments!
5.0,Item was a gift . And she loved it really cute.
5.0,I wear these pants all the time - not just for hiking.  They're comfortable and fit true-to-size.  I'm a size 12 and ordered a large.  They're just a bit loose on me but I like them loose when I'm hiking or just doing jobs outside.  The zippered pockets are deep enough to easily hold my phone.
5.0,This item looks much more expensive than it was and makes a perfect birthday gift for my son's girlfriend.  The shipping was very fast and the item arrived in perfect condition.
5.0,"Breathable, no sweating, cute enough if you see someone, so comfortable. I love them. Would buy another pair."
5.0,Bought this as a present for my best friend when she got married. Its so cute and made well.
5.0,Beautiful for the money and very classy
5.0,Nice quality. Great price. Excellent value for sure.
5.0,Absolutely love this purse!  The color (Wine) is beautiful and  the real leather smell is really nice.  It's nice and roomy on the inside with a zipper pocket on the outside to hold a cell phone or keys. Just transferred all my stuff and have plenty of room to spare for a makeup bag and &#34;techy&#34; stuff. Glad I found this company and on Amazon Prime to boot!  Will definitely be buying more purses from Heshe in the future.
5.0,My wife really likes The watchband
5.0,It looks so elegant with a light green. Wore for a night out. Thanks Y.Castilla
5.0,Bought this for my husband who travels a lot for work. I like it is large enough for regular sized bottles. The zippers are fairly sturdy. The little mesh pockets are good sizes too.
5.0,Great hat...huge fan of City Hunter
5.0,Very nice! Not as scratchy as I thought it would be. I got tons of compliments
5.0,Well made.  Right length.  Keeps glasses safe & secure.  Don't know how/why nobody ever came up with this design before.  Perfect!
5.0,I love every about!
5.0,"Its fit nicely, and in black flattering."
5.0,I really love this skort. Very comfortable. Launders well.
5.0,Gift for myself I just luv it
5.0,Fits great and so cute
5.0,Love these. The style is perfect for under my uniform without extra bulk
5.0,"My grandson stays over a lot with me,I like to have extra clothes and underwear on hand!"
5.0,"Buen producto, los terminados y la horma de la gorra est√°n bien dise√±adas al igual que los logos de las marcas."
5.0,I like the bright colors and it keeps my children entertained.
5.0,"I bought one in every color in Medium... then decided I needed a large to give me a little wiggle room on the back.  I'm normally a medium/8, but felt more comfortable in the large.  Wish there were more colors.  They are sometimes referred to as &#34;maternity&#34;, so that will freak your hubby out when you get the delivery notifications  ;-)"
5.0,Item just as described and fit perfectly.
5.0,Fits as expected and I am excited to wear it!
5.0,My son loves spongebob and the sweater has lasted him a longtime he wears it for school it was a really nice sweater I would wash separately and let it air dry on a hanger for better lasting results
5.0,My daughter loves this leotard and it fits great! I used the size chart to determine size.
5.0,Love my Cowboys so therefore I am really happy to find a phone case that I'm proud to show off.
5.0,"I bought this for my son to use while he is paint balling, to protect his neck from stray paint splatters, mainly. He's a teenager, so while he didn't jump for joy, or even display any conventional form of excitement when he saw it for the first time, he does wear it every time he is paint balling, which is a pretty solid endorsement in my book! It has a cool design, but is still subtle enough that he stays camouflaged while in the woods. Great item!"
5.0,"I love this bag. I was looking for a clear bag because of the dumb guidelines at sports areas and specific sizes. So I came across this thought it looked nice and the price was another plus. Ordered it. It's simple but still cute and very sturdy and the strap is comfy.  It can definitely fit a lot of stuff, even a water bottle (I know plastic oops) and has a front zipper as well."
5.0,Rolled the dice with ordering a dress shirt online but was pleasantly surprised. This shirt fit as though it was tailored for me and looks great!!!
5.0,This outfit is so cute. I love the color of the workout set and the way the material feels and stretches. Super excited to wear this outfit!
5.0,My brother put it right on!
5.0,"I received these aviator sunglasses for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. This pair had the blue mirrored lens with silver colored metal frames with black plastic or rubber around the ear areas of the arms. The mirrored lens truly is mirrored not just a shimmer coating to make it look like it. You truly can take them off and look at yourself in them or just wear them and let people reflect back on themselves! The entire pair is lightweight yet durable in the traditional shape of aviator glasses with very large lenses. These also come with a soft possibly microfiber drawstring bag. The bag will not protect them from being crushed, but it will help to keep them clean and scratch free. These were exactly what my teenage daughter had been looking for and she is excited to own them."
5.0,"Bought this as a gift and then had to buy another I loved it so much! Definitely recommend! Great quality, pretty, and a good learning tool!"
5.0,"The necklace extends untill the lower part of the chest. It is adjustable so you can reduce its size to where you feel like it, depending on the style you wanna wear. The material is moderately well worked leather. I take it off before I shower because I feel that the leather will catch a very bad smell in a short time if it gets wet. It is not heavy on me but my girlfriend who gave her the other one tells me that it's a little heavy. So it can be heavy for women.<br />Overall I recommend it"
5.0,I ordered the Doublju Short Sleeve Trendy Slim fit Plus size 2XL.  I am 180# and 5'7&#34;.  The shirt is long enough to cover hips and half thigh.  I wear with leggings and still feel good and covered up.  I will buy another color if available.  The sleeves are cap and fit well.  The fit is slim but very flattering.
5.0,It's hard finding the perfect under garments for my 4 year old without her getting a wedgie. These boy shorts are perfect for her. Covers her bottom and no worries or riding up.
5.0,I absolutely love it. Quality is good for the price. I usually wear medium but it was a little to baggy around my chest area and tummy. Ordering a small want it a little bit more tighter but other than that its a great summer dress. I would but a few different styles.
5.0,"You never know exactly what to expect when buying from a jewelry source for the first time. Rest assured, this was a great purchase. These earrings are exquisite! They have a lot of life and sparkle and they are very comfortable. It would be easy to believe that they cost double the price offered here."
5.0,Great size and quality. Perfect for weekend trips and passes as a carry on!
5.0,Update - I reorder and received  the correct size. The company was amazing to work with. 100% satisfied. Love them. Be sure to hand wash them before wearing.<br /><br /> I ordered a small medium and received large extra large. Two big have to return and re-order correct size. No option to correct my original order. But I like the material
5.0,my niece loved it
5.0,Muy buena . Excelente calidad
5.0,Es un buen producto.. colores bonitos y combinables
5.0,"I am not a leather snob, so I usually look for leather-like materials. This purse hits every marl. I get compliments on it all the time. I like that it has 2 separate zipper compartments that are the same size, so you get the room, but it doesn't become a big black hole, that most of my large purses often turn into. Can't beat it for the price, either!"
5.0,Short on my 6ft niece but still beautiful!
5.0,Bought these for my boyfriend that is a police officer and LOVES them!
5.0,It seems to be well made.
5.0,Easy to use. Conversation starter for sure.
5.0,Love it! Great fit and very comfortable.
5.0,"This is one of the comfiest bras I‚Äôve ever owned, for a fraction of the price of most bras. I have a lot of trouble finding bras that fit since I have a large bust size but medium to smaller cup size. The 2XL fits perfectly!"
5.0,"I LOVE THIS BAG!! I bought it to have something light and compact to take for grocery shopping during COVID-19. I only want to carry the basic minimum and not expose any extra possessions to the virus. This did the job perfectly! I especially liked the small outer compartment that is for 2oz hand sanitizer - who doesn't carry one of those these days?!?<br />I liked it so much I bought a second one to use to pack my laptop cables, portable charger and flash drives in, worked great for that also.<br />THANK YOU FROGGY BAG!"
5.0,Good quality. Fit great
5.0,My feet
5.0,Granddaughter loves her shoes.
5.0,"I did not expect this to be such quality I ordered on the thought of some thing might not be as good as to the picture. But for what I see for now, everything is the same and I liked it, although it is not too expensive but when I put it on my girl,  the little stones on the side shows off a little makes it nice and pretty. without the fitbit interface of the machine, I don't think you would notice this is for a fitbit. I really liked this one, making my girl's fitbit into something she could bring anywhere."
5.0,Love it! Super comfy and warm.
5.0,Very flowy and soft! Very comfortable to wear. It fit just as expected. Great to pair with other casual wear. The material is very stretchy and breathable. One of my favorite pair of pants I own!!
5.0,"Hubby wears loafers with almost everything, and he says these are his favorites ever. He says they are the most confortable! They look great and are holding up well after quite a bit of wear already."
5.0,Very nice fitted hat
5.0,"I have 2 cell phones to keep track of older family members with medical issues, and when I'm waiting for a call from a doctor, pharmacy, etc., I need to keep the phones at hand. I am always setting them down by me in one place but forget to take them with me to another, so I was looking for something to keep the phones in and with me. This is a much better solution than some of the more utilitarian things I've seen---and I can easily fit both phones in here and wear cross-body at work, around the house (upstairs, downstairs, in the yard), walking the dog, etc."
5.0,"I'm definitely ordering more colors. I have the white, which is a very thin material, but with a white tank underneath, it looks great. I love the fit. Flowy through the arms and more fitted in the waist but with enough rouching to hide the chub!"
5.0,"Very good product, fit as expected, soft and comfortable. Love it!"
5.0,I just got this yesterday and tried it on and while it is a little snug for what I thought it would be across the chest it looks GREAT!  I have a classic &#34;apple&#34; shape and this swimsuit actually looks good.  :)  Definitely recommend!
5.0,got package on time
5.0,Bought this for my boyfriend. He loved it :)
5.0,"High quality, fits perfect on my 13 years old son"
5.0,"A terrific travel scarf that looks as good as it functions: it's versatile, soft, and it can be used as a plane pillow, compress, rifle sling, or any number of other functions other than the fact that it keeps you cool in hot climates and warm in cold temperatures"
5.0,This was a birthday present for my granddaughter. She loves it and takes it to dance twice a week. I like it too.
5.0,"As a teacher, May was the month of kindness so I went on Amazon to find a few to alternate on Fridays.  I have received numerous compliments on this shirt.  It is very soft."
5.0,Very easy to get on and comfortable to wear
5.0,Original and just as expected
5.0,Good quality and exactly as seen in picture. No complaints.
5.0,"I was surprised at how much I liked this dress. Bought for a homecoming dress because of its great price. Was expecting to be disappointed, because of all the spelling errors in the description, but was pleasantly surprised. The dress does not have a care instruction tag, but otherwise a very cute dress with a flattering fit. Very comfortable to wear too as it's not too tight."
5.0,It durable
5.0,I was very pleased with my order. I had to return it for a larger size and they complied immediately. Very good experience.
5.0,Bought for my daughter.  She said she likes them.
5.0,I really like these watch bands. I wasn't sure I'd like the green but as it turned out it was a darker green. Both go well with my watches. Both look sleek with my watches and on my arm. I would order them again. They look like they were expensive bands next to others I had yet they I around the same for them. I would purchase them again.
5.0,The size was a little large and clasp did not stay so I lost it very sad as I really did like to wear this bracelet
5.0,Perfect for a person who has a hard time bending.
5.0,Pure awesomeness!
5.0,Looks perfect on my Granddaughter.
5.0,Love the color and ‚Äútwirl‚Äù.  Seems a little expensive
5.0,"This necklace is quite unique.  It is shaped like a chevron with the upper two bars connected to the lower two bars by two rings.  I like the way the various shades of blue (turquoise, dark blue, baby blue) and lavender cubic zirconium crystals are arranged on 18K gold plate.  The crystals catch the light very well.  It‚Äôs very pretty to look at.  It has significant weight to it.  It sits about two inches below level of my collarbone.  It comes with a 17‚Äù gold plated chain that my skin so far has not had an allergic reaction.<br /><br />It comes in a robin egg blue colored box and velveteen drawstring bag.  I will be wearing this necklace a lot.  It‚Äôs the kind of style that I like- casual yet dressy.  It would make a great gift, too.  The price is good at time of this review."
5.0,Very comfortable ‚ô•Ô∏è
5.0,Works well for my 7 year old daughter.
5.0,5‚Äô8‚Äù 138lbs size 6/8 usually and the medium fit perfect. I love these. They were exactly what I expected. I was hoping for a medium tight fit
5.0,I loved this keychain I hope my boyfriend whom is full Russian will love this as much as I think he will. Very pretty and just as what I expected it to be.
5.0,Perfect for some pretend Paris photos I took with my grandnieces.
5.0,Ordered a size larger than normal based on reviews and it was perfect. So many compliments on it! Will probably order in another color!
5.0,"Thanks , for quick response love the tie"
5.0,"Quality is actually better than it was with my previous purchase 3 years ago. Fits perfectly with my VFFs.<br /> I am very happy with this buy,"
5.0,My husband enjoys these sunglasses and he looks ever so handsome.
5.0,Warm gloves for biting cold. Touchscreen works well.
5.0,"I love these pants!  That being said, the sizing for the waist is different than expected.  I wear a 30"" waist and usually that is a little loose.  When I got the 30in waist for these pants it was far to tight.  I had to size up to a 32"" waist which fit perfectly, like my usual 30"" size normally feels.  I would recommend sizing up.  I had to return my initial pair and reorder the size up.<br /><br />Durability and comfort of these pants is amazing.  I can move around freely and comfortably but these are still heavy enough to provide some warmth in the winter and stay cool enough in the summer.  I love the gusseted crotch and use the side thigh pocket for my phone.  My iPhone 11 fits in the side pocket.  Have worn these for a year and they still look brand new.  I can't recommend them enough.  I was nervous buying them because I don't normally spend more than $30 on pants but these were definitely worth the investment.  I wear this same pair about 3 days every week."
5.0,"I ordered size 8, normally wear a size 8.5.  But the UGG website suggests ordering a size or 1/2 size down in their boots.  These were fantastic...stylish, comfortable and warm, during our trip to the Austria in February.  I can't wait to wear them again next winter season!"
5.0,I get endless compliments on these. I love them
5.0,These bracelets are gorgeous.  The tiny &#34;handbell&#34; charm makes a tiny tink when listened to closely.  I wear a lot of black and white and the bracelets coordinate nicely with my wardrobe.  Beads are warm and smooth against the skin.  Would make a great gift if you can part with them.
5.0,"I‚Äôve used them for running, and working out. Gray color with the thread line design is amazing. Looks really special compared with my other yoga pants. I love these running pants from the feel of the fabric, fit, color and functionality! During my workout they stayed in place and I didn‚Äôt have that uncomfortable sweaty feeling because they were definitely breathable. I tested them out with few stretches and they have good flexibility. They‚Äôre also definitely squat proof, not see through at all. Also, they have side pockets for phone and keys.¬†I definitely recommend these yoga pants, they‚Äôre great quality for their price, it can definitely compare to higher priced yoga pants!"
5.0,My granddaughter likes to swirl in it!
5.0,Fit was perfect .  Very comfortable.  Loved the color.  It was better than I the picture.
5.0,"Good quality, fit nicely and seems comfy! Came in early and in a cute bag !"
5.0,"The insole that helps with arch support, and heel comfort. They can be taken out of any pair of shoes and placed in another. Helps make your feet feel great, and eases leg ache"
5.0,very cute - great value.
5.0,"Beautiful set, just in time for the Birthday Ball, Semper Fi!"
5.0,So stinking cute... we love this.

5.0,Was a gift for my mom and she loved them
5.0,"I did order a bit larger because I was not sure of how it would fit.  It is a bit loose but due to the style, it still looks great.  The fabric is a nice material and could really be dressed up!  I have yet to find a romper that I love and I may have!"
5.0,I get so many compliments on this dress! Perfect for work
5.0,"I would like to rate this, IF IT WOULD ARRIVE! Ordered Nov 29, today is Dec 7th, I pay a prime membership fee, this is a qualified purchase. What‚Äôs up Amazon??<br /><br />I selected 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è to not hurt the vendor only!"
5.0,Well my wife likes them and they look good on the buns so what do I say more...
5.0,Awesome inexpensive choice for the 11th Doctor Cosplay starter kit
5.0,"Really comfortable band. It is adjustable so you can make it fit you perfectly, stylish get lots of compliments"
5.0,"perfect size for passport, a few extras cards and cash and still fits in most pockets"
5.0,"This is my second purchase for one of these shirts, from a different seller though but the quality of the shirt is just as great. This is a gift for my nephew who loves Friday night funkin. My advice to the manufacturer is get rid of the guns on the shirts. Children are not allowed to display pictures of guns at school these days. I would have gotten him many more of these but those guns are an issue."
5.0,"Love it, it‚Äôs soft , stylish the best"
5.0,Cute and compact luggage for my little one. It would be better if the backpack had a clasp on it so we can secure it while the little one is carrying it. He's jet setting with this amazing set of wheels for sure!
5.0,Love the scarf. looks as though I spent much  more . It super big and the quality is just right.
5.0,Really liked it and it was formal enough for the wedding but comfortable for the reception. I went a size bigger than I normally wear so keep that in mind!
5.0,"I‚Äôve always been super hesitant of buying activewear from Amazon, but these were recommended by a friend. And damn, they‚Äôre actually pretty nice! Same level of quality as my $90 joggers. I‚Äôm usually a LG or XL, based on the reviews I went with a large (glad I did). They definitely fit more like leggings, but that‚Äôs what I wanted. The waist band is nice, doesn‚Äôt roll down at all. On me, the waistband comes up just below my belly button and lengthwise: end up a little bit above my ankles(more of a 7/8th length). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 165 lbs, and wider in the hips/thigh area for reference."
5.0,"A cute bag that's pretty roomy. The straps don't hurt, and doesn't have a weird smell. The bottom is not super hard so it didn't stand up on it's own as much as I expected (probably since it had to be flat for shipping), but once you add items in it won't fall over. In my case, it said the item was available for prime shipping but it said it'll take more than the usual 2 days so I had pay for shipping in order to get it within the week...it shouldn't be a problem if you're not in a rush to get a bag, though."
5.0,"Fits good, looks good, feels good>>"
5.0,"Fits perfectly and it looks just like the picture, very happy with my purchase."
5.0,I like the swimsuit so far. The color is just like the website. The fit is good. I like the style and fabric.
5.0,It‚Äôs amazing
5.0,Nice comfortable fit.<br />Thin enough for the day and warm enough for colder nights
5.0,Justo lo que esperaba.Cinco estrellas.
5.0,She love it ya this pic doesn't do it justice turquice shows up best in person
5.0,I personally love it i bought a large cause im pregnant and its so comfy did take a while but thats to be expected coming frim far away. The middle is made of differwnt material then rest
5.0,"Extremely versatile and comfortable. Great quality, lightweight. Looked great when I wore to a party downtown and when I wore as a casual cover with my shorts and tank top."
5.0,Nice hat kinda pricey for a hat made in China.
5.0,"For the weight of the jacket, I was skeptical, but hands down this is the best jacket I own!"
5.0,I bought this to use for Halloween so we haven't worn it yet. But the quality seems good and I tried it on my 15 month old son and it fit pretty well with room to grow
5.0,Love this!  Works 5x better than my old lanyard!
5.0,Beautiful shorts. Really comfy
5.0,My older son prefers these over his other masks. He is in hybrid learning and has to wear a mask all day when in school. He likes the designs (he's 11) and he likes the fit and fabric.  I would definitely buy again.
5.0,"The bag is a bit too big for me, but I love it. It is made of durable fabric and very roomy for traveling as an extra carry on bag. I am in love with this bag and will buy it again if I ever have to."
5.0,I needed to have a button up top and something comfortable to wear after my surgery. I actually wore these to the hospital and then home again. They are very comfortable and held up well in the washer/dryer. I‚Äôve basically lived in these pajamas for a few days and would definitely recommend.
5.0,I was very pleased with this skirt! Good material and quality. It‚Äôs hard to find a true XS these days. The fit was perfect.
5.0,Nice Cleats
5.0,Perfect for classroom!
5.0,Very warm and soft. Perfect for my 95 year old mother.
5.0,My daughter loves this shoe

5.0,"Love the head wrap very soft I personally wear for causal  with jeans, dresses."
5.0,"I am 5'2"" and 105 lb. I ordered an XS and this fit me right above knee and a little loose side but that's exactly how i had expected it would be. I got lot of complements. The color and style was exactly like in the picture and good quality."
5.0,Really good quality. Held up well so far.
5.0,"it is a pretty decent size bag, pretty sturdy and love that you can carry it as a backpack or as a  regular bag, it has handles for that, which is think is pretty cool. is not like normal string bags that are such weak material. strong strings to handle a lot as a backpack"
5.0,"Loved the first one I bought so much, that I bought it in 3 more different colors!  Comfortable and shades your eyes."
5.0,Like the earrings a lot
5.0,Loe these boots
5.0,I really like the fit and feel of this watch and band.  It is very comfortable.
5.0,She loves this purse!!
5.0,Very nice and shiny charm. Very sturdy and durable. Well made and an excellent addition to any charm bracelet.
5.0,This dress is absolutely gorgeous same color and tutu style but the entire top is different. No mesh at all. The back has zipper no buttons. It doesn‚Äôt fall off the shoulders it stays around the neck part. And no shimmer like the photo. The size was accurate. My 10 year old daughter 70lbs got a size 8
5.0,Using for a birthday party picture
5.0,Standard socks. True to the color Navy Blue.
5.0,I. Love. These. Glasses. Very nice weight to them and they look even better in person! Great casing too!
5.0,My 2 year old loves these sun glasses!  So far they have held up to all the bends and twists.  They are very well made and fit his face well!
5.0,"The material is super soft and has a great stretch to it. I am a 34DDD and ordered a medium and it fit great!<br />Only downside is that if you are wearing a dark or bright colored bra, it is a little sheer. If you are wearing a jacket or button up over it, it's pretty much unnoticeable. 10/10 would recommend, great basic tank."
5.0,"Excellent fit, very comfortable."
5.0,My wife loves these tote bags and decorates them with her creativity!
5.0,Fits perfect just as I imagine love it
5.0,Great value.  A year later and they still look great.
5.0,Super cute great necklace
5.0,"This thing really is 9-18mo size! Well, I haven‚Äôt tried it on my 13mo yet, but it‚Äôll definitely fit for a while!<br />The material is kinda like a soccer Jersey material, which is cute. Can‚Äôt until we can show this to baby‚Äôs pap√° for Christmas!"
5.0,We live in the north east and since covid we have some hesitations about using the locker room after class. This keeps little warm and protected from weather after early morning swim class
5.0,"My daughter chose this swimsuit and we were hesitant to purchase because of the 3/5 star rating. She loves the swimsuit and it's very cute on her! The only thing she didn't like was the thick bra padding, but that's easily removable. The shorts are a nice addition to the set. Overall, we're very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"nice item, good price faster than expected delivery"
5.0,Cute masks. Got several compliments on them. Wash well too.
5.0,"So cute, I use this for my ID at work. The stitching is a little loose, but it has held up so far."
5.0,Love these boots! Great quality. Recommend to anyone looking for stylish comfortable boots for little toes
5.0,Nice quality ~ nicely packaged
5.0,Durable quality backpack. My son loves it!
5.0,"These tie clips are very well made, and I cant wait to use them all. They are simple, yet stylish, and they are a great price!"
5.0,"I love it soo much, I will be purchasing another soon"
5.0,"My mother has worn her original pair of these into the ground.  I was very happy when I found the exact same pair for her.  The others lasted about ten years, so she has some time to get through this pair."
5.0,So much fun to wear
5.0,"Me gusto mucho esa lo que esperaba, es fuerte pero sirve al tacto y si aspecto es muy elegante"
5.0,Used to decorate kids craft bracelets
5.0,Perfection

5.0,These glasses are AWESOME...
5.0,"I liked all of it, best key chain I ever had. sturdy, looks great, great quality...ordered two additional ones for gifts...will not disappoint"
5.0,Great product at a great price.
5.0,"I bought this and it was just warm enough to go with the layering approach - exactly what I wanted!  When you first unpacked it I thought, &#34;this won't be that warm&#34;.  But it is warm.  It's not hot, it's warm.  I skied with it in Colorado, days that were mostly in the teens to low 20s and cloudy, and it was perfect with a couple extra layers.  Although full disclosure: I do ski &#34;hot&#34;.  But if you're not like me, just add a layer.  I simply had a &#34;Hot Chilli&#34; top and a wicking Spyder (polyester-feeling) top under the jacket, and that was enough for me.  Lots of ventilation.  Lots of pockets.  There are two more pockets inside which are not visible in the picture, plus 4 outside (2 on top, 2 at bottom) visible from the picture.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.  I am 6'0&#34; and about 225 pounds - big frame - and a large fit me perfectly.  (Whereas I would have normally expected to need an XL.)  So I think they run a bit on the large side, which I had read in other reviews and thus I ordered large - and it turned out perfect."
5.0,Beautiful Love it
5.0,Great condition and super cute!!
5.0,"Loved the prompt service. Shirt is lightweight, and comfortable."
5.0,"The best replacement band that is tough.  I swim with this band on my vivoactive about 4-6 times a week.  It has never come undone and has helped me train for 2 triathlons.  If this one ever breaks, which I assume it won‚Äôt, I will definitely buy another one.<br /><br />8/19/2018<br />I finally broke the band...but I beat the hell out of it. The band itself was fine, one of the pins holding the clasp bent from wear.  I could have bought a new pin, to be honest. It was in the pool 4-6x a week along with biking, running and sleeping with it on.  I rarely took it off and used it every day.  I bought a new one in black and if it breaks in a year I‚Äôll probably buy another one again."
5.0,"So cute! And you can‚Äôt beat the price, other places want almost double the price. Great quality."
5.0,Size as expected. Comfortable for wearing overnight and no discoloration.
5.0,"It‚Äôs light, keeps me from getting wet, and has held up great with daily wear."
5.0,"I've bought several pairs of these socks.  I'm a nurse and on my feet for hours throughout my shift.  Before I started wearing these, I had some leg/feet swelling along with cramping in my feet and legs at night.  On days when I wear these or the other colors of Nurse Mates Women's Compression socks, I don't wake up in terrible pain.  I've also increased my water intake which probably helps as well.  On a personal note, I don't have any physical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity.  I don't know how they would work for people with edema, but for this working nurse, these have made my life much more bearable."
5.0,"These were perfect.  I received the matching necklace as a gift and didn‚Äôt know there were earrings to match.  Love them! Perfect size, not too heavy, and very pretty."
5.0,As ordeered
5.0,"I absolutely love these sunnies! They are just dark enough but not too dark to where it feels like you're in a different world. The quality is insane considering the affordability, I was shocked when I pulled them out of the case. I'll definitely be ordering more Sojos!"
5.0,The product came on time (actually 3 days  earlier) and it fits. I am happyüòÄ
5.0,This hat is well made and my husband loves it.
5.0,"Really like these - they fit a little larger than I expected, but I‚Äôm happy with them and they‚Äôll be great for yoga."

5.0,Love it! It's gorgeous
5.0,"Like... it's L'il Sebastian!<br />...very light fabric, good summer shirt... and did I mention - IT'S L'IL SEBASTIAN!!!"

5.0,"Beautiful, packaged very well, I'm looking forward to my Cinderella wedding."
5.0,the only this in that there needs to be one more belt loop in the middle however my daughter loved the pants she got a 2x and they were great lots of compliments
5.0,"color did not fade, great price"
5.0,"I got this watch as a gift. Looks even better in-person that the pictures here on Amazon. It's got a classy, understated-elegance look, is very comfortable to wear, and will fit right in when I'm wearing a suit or at a formal-wear event. If you care about quality, good looks, and price but aren't worried about name-brand gravitas, this watch will do nicely. Great value for your money.<br /><br />The one down-side I can think of is this watch doesn't come with instructions on how to adjust the band. I've had clamp-style bands before and know you need to carefully pry the clamp-bar up with a small screwdriver, then wrap the band around your wrist and use a fine-tip Sharpie to mark where the clasp's bar hook  winds up, giving you the approximate placement for the clamp bar. You have to press the clamp bar down very firmly and may need to adjust it's placement slightly up or down from your Sharpie mark, which will be fully hidden by the clamp bar and clasp.<br /><br />Yea, adjusting the wristband takes a little work, and is hard to do if your wrist swells up on a hot day, but it's part of what makes the watch look so nice.<br /><br />Pros: High-quality looks without the name-brand price. Keeps accurate time.<br />Cons: The dial cover is glass, not a cut mineral cover, so it may get scratched or marred with over time. Not a recognized name-brand. Comes in a fairly plain box and packaging that doesn't match the watch's high-end look and feel. Adjusting the wristband requires tools (a small screwdriver) and a few minutes of time. No instructions."
5.0,Christmas gift for my wife.
5.0,My husband loves them perfect fit and very soft
5.0,I got this really fast! Thank u! I love it. Will be buying more soon

5.0,Love this jogging I got them in different color
5.0,most comfortable sock for walking  18 holes of golf 3 times a week
5.0,"This belt is very stretchy, but best of all, has no holes! The buckle hooks into the belt wherever you want it to. Great for those skinnier/fatter days or in-between sizes. This is sold as a men's belt, but it works well for both genders."
5.0,"Great product, comfortable but I ordered an XL and received a Small"
5.0,Sizing is Accurate cut well material is great in so much that hair doesn‚Äôt  cling  to the garment
5.0,Daughter loves

5.0,I LOVE  these I bought the black too and plan on buying the black/white ones too! These are exactly what I wanted!
5.0,I  usually make my decision buying products online by reading the reviews so would like to leave my opinion on this item.I received it way faster than I was expecting and the looks of this shower curtain is much better than I was hoping for.The colors are anywhere from muted pastels to bright colors and very pretty!  The size is just what you find in a store.Happy customer!

5.0,"Great gift, a simple reminder of a sisters love"
5.0,"This hat has great 360 coverage. I used it on a mapping trip out in the desert and it was like my own personal shade spot. If you are looking for a hat that provides good shade and is not overly large and funny looking then this is the hat for you. Great for gardening, hiking, the beach, or walking around somewhere sunny. Very satisfied with my purchase. Also I love that it's adjustable for someone with a small head like me."
5.0,shirt graphics are great! washed multiple times and the color hasn't faded yet. very happy with my purchase!
5.0,I love these jeans. All the other reviews were right when they said these jeans are comfy and flattering. I'm very happy with this buy. Pay attention to the sizing chart the description has cause it's pretty spot on. Will be purchasing more of these jeans from this brand.

5.0,They were a requested gift. She loved them.
5.0,This hat is great. My new favorite hat. Looks great & feels comfortable.

5.0,Cute as a clutch!
5.0,"Nice looking jacket, size runs a little bigger than expected."
5.0,"I still like this dress, though it tends to fall off the shoulder. Very soft light rayon, a warmer tan, less pink underskirt would improve this dress visually, but generally soft easy and flattering, I wear a soft golden very long scarf to correct the large head shoulder neckline opening. I basically enjoy wearing this dress, I love the light fabric and the green is a perfect olive, buy, it you will enjoy the dress."
5.0,Fits perfect! Super comfy! Fitted bottom I love this
5.0,"This fits well, keeps moisture away and it looks and feels nice. They are lightweight and perfect for running. Very comfortable and true to size."

5.0,This item is smaller than pictures but cute. I had to enlarge a picture of it in order to read the writing!
5.0,Bought it as a gift for my mother in law and she thought it was great.  Plenty of space for her stuff but not bulky.
5.0,"UPDATE: I‚Äôve had these five years now. They have NOT FADED ONE BIT. These are seriously magic. Some pilling (ONLY in crotch area) that I take care of with a fabric shaver. One pair just now finally started to get a small hole in the seam but I‚Äôll probably stitch it up myself. Seriously -NO FADING, NO PILLING!!!!<br />I've washed these about 50 times by now. Never once have they faded and I don't use any special black colored laundry detergent. They fit the exact same no matter how many times they've gone through the wash and dryer. Totally worth every penny!!! These are my weekend staples!!!"
5.0,Great price! Great quality
5.0,"I ordered these for my 6-year-old son and he LOVED them and wore them the moment they arrived (even though it was during the end of a HOT summer). He says they are very comfortable. My son sometimes has a difficult time fitting into shoes because he has a high instep. But he loves these Crocks so much, that he told me to write a review on Amazon and give them a rating of 100%."
5.0,"Absolutely love love live these overalls, so comfortable...."
5.0,"Love it, very cozy"
5.0,Loved the material and look.  The recommended size was a little snug for me.

5.0,Great quality. Son loves the cape.
5.0,Was a Christmas gift for my DIL. She loves it!
5.0,Sports shirtd simple as that. You want a nice gym shirt this is a great choice. Breaths diring exercise with ease. Colors to not fade. Size does shrink a little.
5.0,"I love this jacket/sweater. I got the grey and blue colorway. Does not look exactly like the picture, but it still looks great. The inside feels as soft as cashmere. I've washed it a couple times and it did not stretch or lose ink. The fit was great. I went by the size chart and got an athletic to slim fit. Exactly what I wanted. I can wear it with a simple v neck sweater or t shirt, or go formal and layer it over a button down. Love it."
5.0,Came like it said. Great quality!
5.0,I genuinely love this sweater. It‚Äôs thick threads and comfortable feel against my skin are a winning combination. I love the design/dinosaur illustration and rich green color. It‚Äôs the perfect length for hip and booty covering as well.
5.0,"Exactly what I expected, high quality and they fit my size 13 feet. I would buy these again."
5.0,Very cute and flattering dress. Wish it came in XS then the fit would be even better but it still fits nicely.<br />5'5&#34; 102 lb sz 0-2

5.0,It's a perfect fit.
5.0,"The cleavage area was too loose , the fit at the waist was just fine it stretches and it is soft , you can move comfortably. It's a pretty color (as shown in the description."
5.0,This bra is awesome! It works really well and it's very comfortable. I normally wear a 38 D and I ordered a 42 C and it fit perfectly. The cup was a tiny bit small but not to the point where it was uncomfortable and I think it added a bit more clevage anyway. I've tried a lot of different things and so far this $12 bra is the best. I highly recommend it. It's also now one of the comfiest bras I own
5.0,I got the masks for my daughter so she can adjust her mask to fit her. She said that they are comfortable and easy to adjust! Definitely worth the price and I didn‚Äôt have to wait long for them to get to me. Can‚Äôt beat the price!

5.0,AWESOME!!
5.0,I purchased these for my 4 year old girl for 50s dress up coming up. They fit her perfectly. I thought it was going to come with out the plastic on the frame but it had it. So happy for that. They don't look cheap at all. I just hope she can take care of them for next year üòÅ
5.0,Flatters and feels soft and cozy! Love it
5.0,"Feels like a second skin! I really like these leggings and for the price it‚Äôs definitely a win! I‚Äôm 180lbs and got a medium and a large, but the mediums fit the best! I love them!"

5.0,Only used it once so far.  Its comfortable so I hope it holds up.
5.0,"I love it, very comfortable and looks great."
5.0,I have not worn it yet but I did try it on
5.0,"These run small, as described. Order 1/2 to a full size bigger than street shoe size, if you plan to wear socks with this boot & how long you want it to last. Have a special needs kid & LOVE these for her because she won't keep socks on.  My kid is not super coordinated, so I only order 1/2 size too big. Great warm boot!!! Pink color adorable and the zipper is a must! Owned several pairs."
5.0,Great top. It's supposed to be a little loose so I liked the fit. Perfect for spring.
5.0,My 5 year-old LOVED them. She wants to wear them everywhere and shows them to anyone who walks through our door.

5.0,"She loves this dress.  This is a lightweight well made summer dress that looks really good on her.  The sleeves have a small ruffle look at the ends.  The neck has a small material tie to adjust to the neck so its comfortable.  The dress is a simple classy casual wear summer dress.  My daughter wears a small and this dress was a small.  It hangs right everywhere and really does look good on her.  At under $25, this dress is worth every penny.  My daughter loves it."
5.0,This is so much more detailed in person.  It's adorable.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,Perfect for carrying cards and some dollar bills. Easily fits in any pocket.

5.0,Fave bras ever. My friend introduced me. Want more colors! Blue Blush Yellow!
5.0,"I'm not flat chested so the bust is a bit small, otherwise it's perfect.  I love that it converts to a dress or romper.  I ordered the thin material and it's a nice weight.  Not too thin.  Washes well, I hang to dry.  I love it!"
5.0,"nice pins, not sure why you want to know how they fit?"
5.0,Very good cleaning effect.  Fits good with my face
5.0,Very comfortable and pretty
5.0,I love the detail and it is very comfortable to wear.
5.0,It is so comfortable!
5.0,"I'm petite, 5'1 so I hoped the cropped shirt/jacket would be a better fit than most. It fit well and slightly oversized but it was too short for to cover my mom belly. If you have a flat stomach its perfect but if you have a slight pooch, it may be too short to cover this area. I am highly sensitive to this. I will pass along to my bestie who has no children and it will be perfect for her!"
5.0,Love the masks they are comfortable we are well and people absolutely love them I get a lot of compliments on these
5.0,"I have a Q Explorist Gen3, it fit perfectly. It was easy to switch out the bands. It's  thick and quite comfortable. It's only the first day of wearing it, but so far so good"
5.0,"Looks great! I'm about 135lbs, 5'4"", wear a 32DD/34D. I ordered a medium, but I think I would have preferred a small. I like tight fitting clothes so I ended up shrinking it in the wash to get a tighter fit. It's a lot higher crop than the picture shows, which is my style so it's perfect. Really sexy, I can't wait for warm weather to wear this!"
5.0,"Colors exactly as pictured, choker is adjustable to fit multiple neck widths. I have a small neck and on the smallest setting it's just a little bit loose, just enough to be comfortable. The material isn't too uncomfortable and doesn't dig into your neck. I'm willing to bet the metal on the heart part will react with skin and tarnish over time, but for the price, that's okay with me. Most cheap jewelry does the same thing.<br />They also seem well put together, I don't think they will be falling apart anytime soon. I love that I was able to get four colors for $10, one to match most of my clothes! :)"
5.0,"Great design, beautifully and sturdily put together. Will last for many, many years, and looks great. It's also very comfortable to wear."
5.0,The mouse pad is attractive and looks great with my d√©cor.
5.0,Too small.  'Had to send it back.  Pretty material though.
5.0,Fit amazing !
5.0,Great! Solid NF jacket
5.0,My daughter is 13 and is autistic and had a sensory issue with pads so her obgyn told us to get these I was skeptical at first. She has only used it for 2days. But in the time she used it it was a life changer and definitely changed my mind about them will be buying more. I did buy a size up for her she is 13 and weighs about 85-95 lbs and I bought her the 11/12 and it fits perfectly
5.0,"I couldn‚Äôt believe what a beautiful product this is. From the picture, I thought that it would be something that I would like. When I opened the box and tried it on, this nightgown was much more than I expected. It is lightweight and quite soft. The shiny satin trim adds a nice touch. It fits exactly right, and nicely shows the curves without being tight. I will be buying more in other colors."
5.0,Looks just like the picture colors pop got it As a present for my sister she loves it
5.0,A regular watch that doesn‚Äôt have numbers. Guess the timeüëçüëç
5.0,Nice addition to a dress outfit
5.0,Adorable !  Sleeves a little long.
5.0,Colors are as advertised and very comfortable.
5.0,They are awesome makes. They are very well made and have a pocket for filters. Also nice how they are adjustable.
5.0,tan xtra large..they<br /> fit good...it's my true size  soft and comfortable leather sheepskin the real stuff...you won't be disappointed....I have bought several pairs of gloves here on amazon..like these...for much more money and these are just as good...
5.0,Muy bonito reloj el estuche no s√© si este da√±ado o sea as√≠ pero cuesta un poco de trabajo abrirlo
5.0,True to size! My kid LOVED dressing up in these.
5.0,"Love the color and great quality!!! I'm 5'7"" and 140lbs. The bottom fit perfect but the top is a little baggy. Going to get it tailored."
5.0,"I wore this to my company Christmas party. It was comfortable and I received so many compliments! Material is great and not see through. The split is pretty high, so if you plan on wearing a spanx like i did, might need to tack the split a bit so it‚Äôs not show. I wore the green one and bought a navy blue one I love it so much!"
5.0,I bought the bracelet as a Christmas present for my daughter.  I think she will love it and will be able to add charms suitable to her exact tastesf
5.0,These glasses are adorable. I got them for my daughter‚Äôs 50s dance!
5.0,Cute fit and have already got compliments
5.0,"These are excellent and do not slip. They fit snugly and the silicone patch on the heel keeps them in place. They show a little in my low cut shoes but I think that's because I have really small feet but a little bit of reconfiguration, and they disappear right into my shoes. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"The material is SO SOFT! I love this dress, but it fits very tight for those of you who may not like your dress to be skin tight. I am happy with size I got, and my measurements are 5'4, 125 pounds, 32C. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend, I would just make sure to plan your size accordingly!"
5.0,Did not meet expectations. It did not come full of money......WALLET WAS FINE..MET EXPECTATIONS.
5.0,"Very cute, good quality.  Two ankle bracelets are included so more ways to wear them."
5.0,Grandson loves it.  Runs a little small.  Upsize it!
5.0,The colors are nice and vibrant and the band is comfortable. I wear one on my Apple Watch daily.
5.0,"No exaggeration. It is so soft and cozy. The length is great on me. It comes to my knees. The belt is long enough to make a proper bow, if you like. It doesn't slip itself undone, either. The sleeves aren't so big and loose that cold air blows in. So thankful for that! I'll be in it in all my off hours."
5.0,Great value and they look very nice.
5.0,My skates fit perfect
5.0,"These compression sleeves are great to use during or after a run/workout.  They are a bit difficult to put on, but once they‚Äôre on, they feel so good.  When running, your calf muscles vibrate and dissipate (or lose) energy. As a result of microscopic tearing of the muscle fibers, your muscles become sore after running which is the main cause of pain after running.  These sleeves help me reduce pain from shin splints, recover faster after my run, and reduce fatigue during my run.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Barely there - Through a dedicated eye for detail, these premium Leg Compression Sleeve are ideal for your everyday needs. Made of durable, high quality materials and painstakingly measured to ensure an exact fit, they're so comfortable, you'll forget you have them on.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ The warm up - It's known that a warm muscle is less likely to be injured, and performs better overall. Though breathable, our calf compression sleeve is sturdy enough to help increase blood flow throughout your leg muscles, and offers enough resistance to give your legs extra support, while enhancing your athletic activities.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Pain away - If you've ever dealt with Shin Splints, you know the discomfort and outright pain they can bring. Feel more confident to stay on your feet and avoid that unwanted pain as well as muscle cramps while you travel, work, or play.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Profession grade compression - When it comes to compression gear, not all are created equal. Some don't fit right, and some don't work right, but these sleeves are a quality fit with a true graduated compression strength of 15-20 mm Hg, which will help improve performance while alleviating leg pain and swelling.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Helps shin splints and prevent injuries - Runners are prone to lots of common inflammation injuries. Using these compression sleeves will help you get relief from shin splints pain and prevent further injuries. They offer true graduated compression. The pressure starts at 25 mm Hg at the top of the sleeve and progresses smoothly to 20 mm Hg at the bottom of the pair of sleeves. This ensures increased blood transport to muscles over the entire length of the sleeve.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Active and Recovery sleeves ‚Äì These compression sleeves may be used as both active and recovery sleeves. When used while running, the graduated compression reduces muscle vibration, which in turn reduces muscle fatigue. When used as a recovery sleeve, the increase in blood flow helps oxygen starved muscles recover much faster than normal.<br /><br />Please note I purchased this product discounted in exchange for an honest review."
5.0,bought for a custom this is a good price
5.0,"This watch is even better than I had hoped for. It looks, feels and works like a much more expensive timepiece. Worth every penny."
5.0,Granddaughter loves them. Evidently it's a thing.
5.0,"My first Spanx and boy, does it deliver! Instantly slims and when paired with my form fitting tank, wow! Can wear all day without feeling the need to take it off. Love this purchase!"
5.0,"Nice looking glasses for my 7 year old son. Lightweight, well made, polarized, cool accessories & delivered early."
5.0,Bought these shoes for my grandson who is a huge Mickey Mouse fan. Very colorful and the lights in the heals are bright. He loves them!!
5.0,Very cute! The color is vivid.
5.0,I purchased this item because I have a nickel allergy and wanted new earrings in this style. I like that it came in a cute little case and it had metal and plastic backs for them. I have not had a reaction to the metal in the earrings. I would purchase again.
5.0,has all of the characters
5.0,"Love It! Just what I was looking for, to tackle daily chores."
5.0,"It's definitely a beautiful scrub tee but it's looser than I anticipated for a Large compared to other brands of tee scrubs in Large.  Also, the sleeves are very long and much wider towards the wrist and hands vs tapered.  I have to get the sleeves shortened before I can wear it; the sleeves won't stay rolled because the material is silky, plus it kills the great look of the tee."
5.0,Breathable yet durable. Perfect for wear with body armor or a warm day on the range.
5.0,"This blouse is very well made, high quality cotton fabric, fit is true to size, and the leaf print is colorful and vibrant."
5.0,perfect just as described
5.0,Got this for my long distance boyfriend and I! They are so cute and every time I grab my keys I smile. Super cute and worth the small price. Might make them into necklaces
5.0,The hairs on top fall out easily but it‚Äôs great for the price!
5.0,"Wore this on my vacation, and it‚Äôs just adorable. What more can you say? Two thumbs up."
5.0,"Super soft, seems a little delicate but time will tell. It's a boxy fit, loose, not fitted. So cute. Color is accurate. I'm 5'1"" and 134lbs, got a medium."
5.0,Daughter love's get purse.
5.0,The scarf is well constructed and beautiful. I plan to purchase more
5.0,Good winder for watch.  At first I thought it wasn't working but it just took a whole because it had been awhile since I used the watch.
5.0,The sweater was super soft and well made but a little small. The company had amazing customer service though; they responded quickly and offered to send out a larger size for me promptly. I‚Äôm looking forward to the new sweater getting here.  It was thicker than I expected it to be for the cost which will be really nice this winter. Definitely size up but worth the money.
5.0,Great tanks! I wear daily. Can wash dozens of times barely even fade!
5.0,"Very pretty, very dainty. My daughter will love this for Christmas."
5.0,For My Grandson.
5.0,"I came back and ordered 3 more after getting one a while back. They flow nicely and the colors are good. Only complaint is that if I even get water on them, I have to wash them because they look stained. Odd fabric reaction but goes away after laundry."
5.0,I love these tops and very comfortable.  Also love the colors to choose from.  Will definitely recommend to my friends.
5.0,It is beautiful and so elegant.  The package arrived ahead of schedule and packed very well. Thank you.
5.0,"Loved the variety! There was a combination of silver, gold, and i beleive one was rose-gold. Very pretty."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress.  I have 3 of them now.  I have a pear shaped body, so my lower half is 3 sizes bigger than my top half.  To compound this, I was very obese and have recently lost an enormous amount of weight.  Needless to say, finding clothes that fit all parts of me is difficult.  The adjustable straps and the longer top part (above the waist seem) allow for a wide variety of bust sizes, and also allow for varying arrays of modesty.<br />The fabric is soft and  sturdy, and NOT TRANSPARENT!  I look forward to buying many more of this amazingly inexpensive dress.  I just wish it came in more colors!"
5.0,"I ordered a large, it fits great! Stays up in place with straps and good material."
5.0,I use it to carry swimming stuff to the Y.
5.0,"nice bright colors, especially the good solid black, good fabric, smooth feel. slightly sheer, mostly opaque."
5.0,A+ !!!!
5.0,"I ordered this watch and the shipping and everything was fast. I must say the watch is really nice, it comes in a nice metallic box with the instructions inside (although, if you ask me, I prefer Nixon's boxes and their design, even for the cheap watches) and my only complaint is that the watch is 42mm wide as it says here, BUT since it's shape is more like a rectangle, it's not 42mm tall, and it feels small in my wrist. (I am 6ft tall), otherwise, very nice watch!"
5.0,"I &#34;settled&#34; on the color (red) because the price was low and I didn't want to spend a lot. I was pleasantly surrised by how pretty it is. It's also well-made, very sturdy, and I expect it will last a long time. Easy to put on and take off. Stays in place. Very satisfied with this purchase. I bought it to wear while watching Royal Wedding (Harry & Meghan) thinking it would only be worn once, but I just might wear it again sometime considering how pretty it is!"
5.0,"I have a love/hate relationship with face masks. Mostly I hate them because they don't seem to fit my face properly and my glasses stay fogged up.  Not the case with this mask!  It is, by far, the easiest to breathe in and the way it adjusts makes it fit properly against my face, and it has a bendable nosepiece. No more foggy glasses.. oh and my granddaughter loved the Cheshire cat (bought the mask to wear to her birthday party)."
5.0,Never thought I'd like these bras so much. After all they are so inexpensive. But they fit perfectly and even better that somewhat bulgy area on the sides and back  we all seem to have are totally smooth.
5.0,"Me encantaron las botas, es justo lo que quer√≠a!! Gracias Amazon"
5.0,"Really cute and fits great. I don't really like the brown tab but I guess that's just the new fashion thing. The pompom feels loose and I keep worrying that it'll fall off, but the stitching looks fine with it so I might just be worried over nothing.<br /><br />The inside is furry and soft and really comfortable. Glad I bought this for the harsh PA winters."
5.0,Wished every thing didn't fall to the bottom though.
5.0,Nicr
5.0,This is beautiful and shiny. I would of liked to see a picture in it but. Other then that love it
5.0,I used this for a cruise and it worked out perfectly. Protected my jewelry and kept it organized.
5.0,It's super comfy but it's so large I can only wear it as a night shirt.
5.0,I received soooo many compliments when I wore this outfit. It is so sexy and fits as expected....I just purchased the blue one.
5.0,I bought this top for my Daughter for Mother's Day. & She loves it.
5.0,"Cute, fluffy, its perfect - Kids medium"
5.0,i have not worn these yet but excited to try em out!
5.0,Love this dress for work.
5.0,Beautiful!! The second one I‚Äôve bought my niece. First the blue and now the pink. üå∏üíù Gorgeous little summer dress!
5.0,"Super cute dress! Arms a little tight with the non-stretch lace parts, but it loosens with wear. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 158 lbs and got a Medium."
5.0,"Good quality, sturdy and stiff"
5.0,"My partner purchased this for me to wear as a costume to a Halloween party. I'm 5'3&#34; (long legs/short torso) 138ish (not athletic) with a 30.5&#34; waist and 34B/C bra. I'm usually between a medium and large depending on brand. I bought the large because I didn't want a tight fit and wanted to be able to move around for the party. (It's always easier to take fabric in and this comes with a sash/belt! I tied this in the back as I thought it was cuter that way.) My shoulders are a bit broad and I think the medium would have been uncomfortable in the sleeves/shoulder area. The dress is unlined and I paired it with [[ASIN:B01EKUTT3Y Short Petticoat Great Accessory for Retro Dress (M,Ivory)]] (in hindsight, I should have also gotten that in a large as well...) My only complaint is that the dress is made of a stiff cotton, so by the end of the night the cap sleeves had irritated/chaffed my underarms. I wonder if this will stop being a problem after a few rounds in the washer. Overall I'm happy with the dress for the $20 price we paid."
5.0,Love it! So cool looking and holds everything!
5.0,"These are seriously my favorite pants! I own them in three colors (black, burgundy, and olive) and they have all held up incredibly well. My burgundy pair, which I have owned the longest, is starting to pill slightly, but I attribute this to the frequency with which I wear and wash them.<br />My only complaint? There aren't enough colors! I would seriously buy another five pairs if the colors I want were available. Fingers crossed that the brand expands this product."
5.0,Own the silver one. Looks good l like it. It's keeping time. The bezel is were you can feel the cheap construction it is not very firm and can be moved a little to the right like .5mm it is very easy to move it the left. Unlike my casio duro that needs a lot of force to move.  It barely glows in the dark. This watch looks like a divers watch but it is not a divers watch. It is only water resistant so it means that it will work fine for washing your hand or being in rain. In the end it looks like 98% rolex submariner in the design. They copied the design with no shame. I like it and will upgrade it with the invicta automatic diver's watch that looks the same in the design but being automatic and having a brand name that people at least heard about. I get a lot of compliments but also get a &#34;what the... Is a shark army?&#34; For the snubs you will be a cheap person with a fake rolex.<br /><br />Uptade: I replace the nylon with a ritche 20mm bracelet now it looks more expensive and luxurious. Here is the comparisonimage with a casio duro also with a ritche bracelet.
5.0,I like it. Would buy again
5.0,"Very pleasantly surprised. These are gorgeous hoops & there wasn't a flaw with them. I figured for the price & past purchases I've made for hoops from other sellers, that I wasn't expecting too much. However I love them & get plenty of compliments when I wear them. They are not too heavy in my ears at all. I got the largest size & they are pretty big, but they look fabulous. Will definitely order another pair & possibly the other sizes."
5.0,Absolutely fantastic purse for the price!!!
5.0,"I bought this to wear at my baby shower and it was great! Without realizing it, the design I chose had blue and pink which was so appropriate for my gender reveal baby shower. It showed off my baby bump perfectly. It was very comfortable and I now wear it around the house."
5.0,"About what I expected. No more, no less. Happy with the purchase"
5.0,These are really nice and easy to get keys off and on and seem very secure. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Get them!
5.0,Beautiful dress. I'm excited to wear it for the wedding I bought it to attend. I am 5' 4&#34; and weigh 166. I ordered XL because I was concerned about the waist and arm holes fitting. This fit me perfectly with just a slight amount of room but definitely not too big.
5.0,Quality product and quick delivery!
5.0,"Good quality,  shiny."
5.0,I was hesitant at first  but Just order it you‚Äôll be glad you did ‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,Exactly what I ordered/needed. I recently had my triple helix pierced and my ear swelled way bad. The piercer put too short of a labret in. theyre decent quality and way cheaper than buying at a local shop.
5.0,Super cute shirt! Fit great & seems to be made very well.
5.0,Such a must have ! Fit so good and the material is even better
5.0,The slides are comfortable and stylish.
5.0,"This is my 5th pair of Rayban Wayfarers,  but only second pair of the new, smaller framed model.  I love the sunglasses; they're dark enough so that I don't have to squint  in bright sunlight, but not so dark that I have a problem with driving. These are polarized, which as long as I can afford them I will always buy!  Polarized really cuts the glare, and though they are more expensive, for me, they're worth it.  I had my last pair of new wayfarers for about three years and recently lost them (heartbreak) or  I wouldn't have bought this new pair ‚Äì since the old ones were still going strong .  Very well-made, classic, great !"
5.0,It's a lot more breathable than expected and you have plenty of room for long hair
5.0,"I wasn‚Äôt too sure of this, but the price was right, and I loved the patterns, so I gave it a whirl. I‚Äôm glad I did. I was a little skeptical about the cuffs (not really my style) but they blended in seamlessly with the sweater. Very comfortable, not too heavy, and perfect fit (pick your regular size.) Color and style match the pictures. Fast shipping."
5.0,Love this purse and wallet. Get a lot of compliments on it. The only thing I don't care for is the side pockets don't stay snapped shut.
5.0,"Love the look, but the functionality is not the best. There is a mirror image  showing up on the lens and it hurts my eyes"
5.0,I use this cap for surgery.  I like that it is easily adjustible.  Holds up well to multiple launderings.
5.0,I like these a lot.
5.0,"Great thanksgiving outfit if you're not into the typical brown, orange and yellow outfits you come across. It was a bit large for 6 months in my opinion."
5.0,"Nice earrings, good color.  Very pretty."
5.0,Hit all the right spots
5.0,Very comfortable! Fits great!
5.0,Perfect fit.  Was a wedding gift. Could not find a matching robe for the chemise this color matched perfectly.
5.0,"This romper is amazing. I hate romper but this one looked so so so good on. It is definitely for SHORT torso people. I'm 5'3&#34; and I was pushing it; needed help with the zipper because I couldn't stretch to get it myself. But it look absolutely fabulous on and I paired it with 4&#34; heels. I'm a size 12 and got the xl. If you have a fuller bottom, size up! Lots of compliments and pictures great."
5.0,I liked the warning labels ..it really helped having the video explanation of how to use the product.
5.0,This little onesie is soo cute. It runs true to size and the quality is great. The material is so thick. I can't wait until gobble day to dress him up!
5.0,"very pretty casual dress, i purchased the xl and it fit perfectly. hope to buy more in the near future"
5.0,Great quality. Durable real leather. Wear it daily. Have gotten lots of compliments on it.
5.0,"Beautiful, love the sheerness."
5.0,It‚Äôs not a bad shirt it‚Äôs a kinda big but it‚Äôs a men‚Äôs shirt so I didn‚Äôt really expect it to be my exact size
5.0,great!!!
5.0,Nice little bracelet for the price
5.0,Very nice. I've gotten several compliments on it. Very happy with it.
5.0,"So pretty! And for the price, it can't be beat!"
5.0,These are made very well. They come in many sizes and fit as expected. Great for edema .
5.0,"tough boot, have put them through almost every type of work"
5.0,My husband gets compliments on the hat every time he wears it. Very nice materials and very unique.
5.0,I wore a long white tunic T-shirt from Modanisa underneath as this dress is somewhat thin. Next time I‚Äôll wear my long slip underneath too as it seemed to cling to my thick polyester tights somewhat. Still I was very comfy. The fabric wrinkles easily so I will need to probably wash it on the delicate cycle and hang dry it to ensure it doesn‚Äôt go weird.
5.0,I wanted to wait till I had used and washed one.  So far water resistant.  Did not shrink and the coating held.  Washed it with the towels and bleach.
5.0,I love all of the variety of charms.
5.0,"I wear these to work every day, fits well and are comfortable!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful costume. It is heavy and I would say that it is more of a theater quality. You definitely need the pannier slip to go underneath. I will say this it is long. I had to wear high heeled boots and pin up the bottom of the front panel (I can't sew) so that I wouldn't trip and I am nearly 5'8"". I enjoyed my Halloween stint as Marie Antoinette and received many compliments."
5.0,"These worked perfectly in wallet or checkbook , top opening is easier to get to cards instead of end opening"
5.0,very cute little choker
5.0,helps secure any size sunglasses
5.0,Nice bag but a little small for what I was looking to use it for. But good quality
5.0,My daughter always wants to help when I cook so I order the chef hat and apron and was very happy with what I got and not to mention my daughter was stoked when she put them on she wanted to start cooking then and there. Couldn‚Äôt be happier
5.0,So cute! Perfect!
5.0,Super fast shipment excellent customer service and an extremely cute and well-made scarf can't go wrong highly recommended
5.0,"I've been looking for nose hoops that hug my nose and finally found these. They are easy to put on. The only downside is one of the pair is really hard to snap, but they are still great!"
5.0,"Really well made, so cute"
5.0,I bought this for my daughter who is a hairstylist and it was a huge hit! It's very pretty-actually much cuter than in the photo!
5.0,My daughter and I absolutely loves this necklace! My only suggestion is to use a smaller jump trying for the charm so it sits in the center!! Thank you so much!!
5.0,"Great wallet, durible and looks great."
5.0,I loved this swimsuit! I wasn't able to keep it because it didn't fit me in the chest area... I wouldn't suggest this for those who have bigger girls ;) but the fabric and stitching was very nice and the bottoms fit me perfectly. I got a size larger than I usually wear.
5.0,I am happy. I wear it more than most of my other hats.
5.0,This robe is soft and luxurious  not too heavy feeling.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:f996469d758b73a92757377cdb994758]] I loved everything about them. I did get them taken in in the front, and I ordered a large. I‚Äôm 8months pregnant so I had to do some adjustments"
5.0,Love these the kids had so much fun with them.
5.0,Excellent item and superfast delivery.
5.0,So cute! Showed up quickly and in great shape. Mine actually came with 4 snaps for more size options than shown in the picture (which I think is great if you have a smaller neck).
5.0,"I went on vacation this weekend to a waterpark and thought using this wallet would be the perfect time to use it.  I loaded it up with key card and ID and credit cards and attached it to my phone.  I removed the key lanyard.  So far, this case has been great.  It's small enough to slip in my waterproof case and I know all of my items are together.  I also out it around my phone in the evening so that I didn't have to carry a wallet. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"This is my second band, same size same color. My first one held up well but I needed a clean new one."
5.0,Great deal for the price. Purchased for my maid of honor!
5.0,Came before expected.  Stone was very shiny.
5.0,Perfect casual Christmas Eve top! It actually fits perfect.
5.0,Slid in and has a nice clean look!
5.0,Would recommend this dress to those that need to hide a tummy. Fit was excellent and was very comfortable.
5.0,"The pencil case is well divided, with space for the whole kit of colored pencils and pens. All items fit inside, including erasers and sharpeners."
5.0,Nothing really special about these straps but they are priced right and they do the job.  The color selection is also good if you need a selection.
5.0,Love them! Cute and comfortable at a reasonable price!
5.0,Love!!
5.0,"Obsessed with these! My favorite pair of Sojos by far! So stylish, so affordable!"
5.0,My bf loves this hat & bracelet.
5.0,Excellent Quality<br />Can i order more but i need  10pcs  size 50mm / 1.97 inch black if it possible can u send me a message if its okay to order and how much.
5.0,This case came on time and fits my sunglasses perfectly. I would reccomend this case.

5.0,Wore to a event.
5.0,I packed these for vacation and for the kids that don‚Äôt wear them they were thankful I had planned ahead!!
5.0,"Most of the replacement lenses you'll find on the market today are noticeably thinner than the original Oakleys. This isn't a really big deal when it comes to their optical quality, and the Fast Jacket's positive locking system is generally good enough to keep the thinner lenses secured.<br /><br />However, these replacement lenses are very close to OEM thickness. They might even be as thick, but they fill just a little less substantial. That being said, I found the optical quality to be good. The polarization is decent, blocking a fair amount of flat light. I didn't notice any visual distortions along the field of vision.<br /><br />For the price, I think this is a good replacement for Fast Jackets. I got them in brown as an all-purpose driving lens, and the performed as expected. I plan to get some black lenses as well to check their performance in bright sport conditions."
5.0,Love these shadesss and the seller were amazing to deal with. As good as these looked in the picture....they are so much better in person.<br />Great fit and nice and light to wear.

5.0,I love how this slide fits perfect. Its very supportive and has a lot going on in the footed! The ivory color works amazing with my outfits and it looks good with socks. Good quality and overall good comfort. Its not the squishy textured ones but this one is a little more firm but with more support. Its more for going on outings and long walks.
5.0,Love it! Good purchase. Fits as described in size chart.
5.0,"Its very different which I love, comfortable to wear.  Its so shinny that I have received complements on it.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes bracelets, or to a young guy trying to impress his girlfriend"

5.0,Product arrived promptly and was as advertised.  Probably good for a breezy 40 degree day for me.  All the seams were intact and I saw no defects.  Worth the cost

5.0,I got this for my Bf‚Äôs birthday and he was blown back by how comfortable it was!
5.0,"I had given this shoe a 5 star before, but after my daughter used them for a month and a half and I had to throw them away, I give them a 1 star.<br />They looked like garbage after so little time, she didn't have time to grow out of them! The flower curled up, it doesn't look like a flower anymore; the leather scratches very very easily; the heel, where should be an area of great support, folded. Horrible! Never buying See Kai Run's again!"
5.0,I bought this patch to go on my shoulder bag. Great build quality and perfect size for a bag addition. Hope it lasts many years!
5.0,I wore this dress to a wedding and our family Christmas pictures. It is a little above the knee on me and I wore black tights. It was very comfortable and flattering.

5.0,Very nice !! I love that it does not have any slits on the sides. The material is lite and not see through and very soft
5.0,Very nice. Looks just like photo and fits well on my small wrist. Great to find crystals that are not round. These are oval and flat which was what I was hoping for.
5.0,"Awesome. These were for my son who had a huge growth spurt between the end of 6th grade and the start of 7th grade.  He is 13 and already 5'9"" and in a size 13 shoe.  Regular socks were not fitting him and he was frustrated.  These are great and hold up to washing.  He wears them to the gym and when he plays football and has no complaints.<br /><br />I am actually going to buy him another pack of these."
5.0,"very flexible, warm and made well.  higher ankle style is warm, but hard to get on and off if you get a good fit. I am a woman wearing a size 6 shoe and bought an xs size that works good, just a little rascal to get on an off due to the high top"
5.0,"Love this no more plastic band, buckle is great and looks great couldn't be happier!"
5.0,My sister got these pins when we went to Disney world and I regret not getting them. I wanted a goofy and was very happy to get him!!

5.0,Fits good and love color
5.0,"Most comfortable out of all the compression socks I bought. And easier to put on and take off and still felt it working. I have short legs, 5‚Äô3‚Äù and like that these came just below the knees. Others ones I‚Äôve tried were too long for me and ended up above my knees."
5.0,Excellent reusable bags to give away goodies!
5.0,Perfect fit and look.

5.0,This is my 4th pair or the same shoe
5.0,"These lightweight, washable (don‚Äôt put them in the dryer) bags are a great way to organize packing! This set is a good variety, but I have added three middle sized cubes for more flexibility."
5.0,It was perfect for what my daughter needed.
5.0,Picture doesnt do it‚Äôs purpose! Awesome ring
5.0,Great for my daughters first birthday photo shoot!
5.0,like it alot
5.0,"I like to have my hands free, so was looking for a cell phone holder with a shoulder or cross- body strap that would provide easy access to my cell phone. This style is ideal as phone pocket is on the outside. Wallet has 3 additional compartments. The center compartment zips closed separately, and there is a zipper that closed all 3. It is large enough for unfolded bills, has card slots, and small zippered within one of the larger compartments. Made of quality materials, I well-constructed with sturdy zippers. It perfectly fits my needs."
5.0,Esta muy lindo solo un poquito largo
5.0,"Worth it. Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice. Not even my video clip of it. It is small, but the nice little pearl dangles right below its neck. I wish it could be bigger. But I love it just the way it is. This is the only dog brooch that looks legit compared to all the other ones."
5.0,"I lost 50 pounds and all my belts needed extra holes!  Since I still have more weight to lose, I wanted something that would &#34;lose&#34; with me.  Bought the black model with a buckle that was shaped like an &#34;S&#34; which is my last initial which is great.  Very good leather quality and was easy to &#34;adjust by removing some of the leather following very good directions.  Liked it so much, I purchased a brown one (alas, could not get it with the &#34;S&#34;.  Still it was very sharp looking and I eve bought the next smallest size range.  I did not receive a discount for this good review."
5.0,"I am really pleased with this wallet! Color is exactly as shown, quality is as described."
5.0,Fits as it says. Its adorable!! Would buy again.
5.0,Cutw

5.0,Looks better in person!  Love it
5.0,love it.. looks cool with old coins.. no issues yet.
5.0,It was Perfect!
5.0,"beautiful bracelet I purchased it for my wife for valentines day.  She loves it, it fits her wrist perfectly and with the safety chains even if the clap not closed tight you will not lose it.  The clasp is very secure but takes a little time to get use to. The combination of the silver and pink crystal/ ceramic like beads is a perfect match. Was the perfect valentine gift but would work for any occasion."
5.0,Use them as lip rings and they got very well. Sucks that they only come one to a back. So buy multiple.
5.0,Our son loves it.
5.0,It is a very pretty dress and looks exactly like the pic/ I will buy other colors. The fabric is good and stretches just enough to fit well around your curves. I love it
5.0,Very comfortable and cool. Very soft.
5.0,True to size I got both a medium and large and the large does give more room however both look super cute (:

5.0,Purchased this to wear with a sailor like dress that was blue and white stripped and it looks so adorable.  Also wore with a black and white stripped tank top and a black skirt - it was also very cute!  Just the perfect touch to dress it up to the next level!
5.0,"Got these for the guys at Christmas to wear while opening their gifts, had a great time! They always look forward to some fun thing around the holidays, this was my fun one this year! Ho Ho Ho!"
5.0,"Fits great,works perfectly for spin classes.  The pants are fitted without being super tight, and extremely comfortable."
5.0,Super cute. Zip closure at the bottom like an invisible zipper not really my favorite. Super soft fabric! Wish I could‚Äôve gotten more use out of it. Washes fantastically.
5.0,These is my new favorite dress! It's soft and fits me perfectly! I am a 40I/40J bust so I did size up but I think I could have gotten away with not sizing up.
5.0,"I bought this for my friends‚Äô son‚Äôs birthday, he wears it all the time, and now we seriously can‚Äôt see him. This is like the Harry Potter invisibility cloak, help us find him."
5.0,Very sturdy and large enough for two sets of bunker gear.
5.0,I've received many compliments on this bracelet.  It looks more expensive than I paid for it. I purchased a 2nd one in a different color also.  Pleased with the material too.

5.0,Love love love my cozy soft slippers so much more than I expected here it's a for sure plus on my feet
5.0,"Beautiful, high quality. I'm using them to make earrings. My only complaint is that there are too many of the light colors, champagne, pink, golden, that are too similar. It's actually hard to tell them apart when matching them up for earrings."
5.0,Great small item when you don't want to carry any kind of purse.  Put this in your pocket or a small crossbody and you are set.  Great quality!
5.0,Beautiful bright green color. Modest and sexy at the same time. Got many compliments when I wore it. Fabric is thick enough were a slip is not necessary. Would buy again.
5.0,Using it for all my keys. Let‚Äôs me separate the car key out if needed.
5.0,Good quality and cool bumper sticker.
5.0,"Love this so much, #beetleconvertible."
5.0,"I gave the gloves to my mom (88 years old). My mom does not like to wear gloves but these are an exception. She looks loves the soft, fit, and comfortable feel of the gloves.  They are very stylish too."
5.0,Love this item. Skeptical at first but the material looks nice and not cheap at all.
5.0,"I'm 5'8&#34;, 170lbs, 36DDD.  These could be a little more snug (maybe)?  I really like them.  They are soft and I love the 3 camo colors.  I'd love to see more colors."
5.0,"I bought these shorts to go over my bathing suit while I‚Äôm with my kids. I like that the side are adjustable & they‚Äôre comfortable. They run a smidge smaller than I expected, so I would size up if you‚Äôre between sizes. Quality seems pretty good, especially for the price. I would recommend buying these, especially to be used as a cover up."
5.0,Great Bowtie!!
5.0,"The product was a little late, but was exactly as expected when it did arrive, I will be getting more..."
5.0,Love it!! Sizing is perfect.  Would recommend.. flattering for full figured üëç

5.0,"My granddaughter loved this keychain. I selected this one because it had the date on it, the cap with diploma, and celebrated her receiving her Master‚Äôs degree with the words Mastered It!"
5.0,Granddaughter loved this Easter surprise.  Seems sturdy.  Plus makes a nice flashlight for kids at nighttime.üòÑ
5.0,Necklace is stunning. The package was adorable. It would make a great gift. Today was the first time I wore it and I received several compliments. I absolutely love this necklace. The ribbon is a nice touch in place of a chain. Highly recommend
5.0,Super cute and made very well!!
5.0,"Got good compliments, I ordered one for a lady that loved it."
5.0,My daughter LOVED it! She was the Cheshire Cat for our Halloween in July party.

5.0,Love it....
5.0,So pretty and comfortable!! Love it!!
5.0,Much prettier in person than online. Great pair of earrings. They don't cause irritation and they're comfy. They look real.
5.0,"Love them! Great price for 3 pairs of sunglasses and good quality too, can't go wrong"
5.0,"The ring is actruly shinnier than in the pictures I attached. I ordered the ring in a size 7. The size was correct. It hasn't tarnished or scratched since I got it and started wearing it. What I do like is that I can stretch it to be several sizes larger. It is about 5/8 of an inch at the widest part from knuckle to knuckle. And about an inch across from side to side. It is very easy to clean. Just soap and water. No need for special or expensive cleaners. I've always been a fan of silver jewelry, but it does tarish easy. Stainless steel is much stronger and doesn't tarnish. I will definately buy more stainless jewelry now that I know its quality."
5.0,My husband is a software engineer so these were a big hit at his work!
5.0,"This dress looks like expensive wool but is actually very soft and comfy. I got so many compliments at work. It's the perfect length. I'm 5'4"" and weigh 134. The medium was a little loose but l think if l would have purchased a small it would've been too snug. I'm very curvy for my size though so if l get it altered in the waist area, it will be perfect. I have no complaints. It's adorable and feminine yet very professional."
5.0,Very nice and just as expected.
5.0,This is the cuuuuuuuutest pendant ever! Go for different go for unique!!
5.0,"Perfect sock, as usual."
5.0,Love these. Get compliments all of the time.
5.0,"I was puzzled when I first got this shorts set...for one thing, the material is more for jammies. But the shorts are such a long length. My 4 y/o grandson loves them though because he is Bluey obsessed! He wears them for jammies!"
5.0,Came in quickly.  Fit was perfect. Worked well for me having back surgery.
5.0,"I ordered these elastic shoelaces hoping to find a solution for my 3 year old that does not know how to tie shoelaces yet. Im so glad I ordered these, they are super convenient because he can put on his PF Flyers whenever he wants to without having to wait for me to tie them.<br />Just for reference my son wears a size 9 toddler shoe and his shoes were the hight tops. The size I ordered was small and they went to second to last hole which Im ok with."
5.0,bouncy
5.0,"Great fit, love the shape and the material. I plan to order more of this dress in different colors."
5.0,My dad loved it!
5.0,THESE SHOES ARE JUST GORGEOUS!  THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE AND FIT TRUE TO SIZE. I CANNOT WAIT TO WEAR THESE SHOES
5.0,"I found these on a motorcycle web site with good reviews, but shipping made them too pricey to try.  I got these for about 15 shipping included so worth the try.  Ear pieces smooth no sharp edges like cheap models. They fit snug on my head, I wear a medium helmet.  They don't fog up, but I'm not sure how well the rubber foam will stay attached to the glassed, but for 15 bucks if I get a year I'm good with it.  No padding on the nose piece but that's what I'm use too.  They just come in a clear plastic bag, no storage case or bag.  Hope they scratch too easy"
5.0,Beautiful dresses
5.0,good Price came in easy shipping was good @ getting it here quick. Bought this for a friend that Loves dragonfly earrings and looks good in them.
5.0,Great lightweight water socks. My 6yo loved them and kept them on the whole time at the waterpark.
5.0,This was a replacement one for a well-worn (several years) that has been on my key chain and abused.  Glad to find another.
5.0,Fits right!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:9f65de3dbd8ac0ef148bdaad2d609709]] Its cute and fitted a little too small on me like an extra small. And its kinda thin but other than that its cute for an extra small sized person. But i recommend this for when you need a quick backup outfit. it came fast took less than a week to arrive.
5.0,Is a beautiful dress
5.0,great quality  love the colors
5.0,"Perfect Ring, perfect fit. I receive many comments on this beauty!"
5.0,Super love this swimsuit! It arrived way quicker than expected and it fits perfectly on me. Highly recommended!!
5.0,"I bought the purple and the red, both are pretty.  The red isn't a deep dark red, seems to have a little bit of an orange or pinkish tint to it but still looks red.  No complaints."
5.0,Better than I thought
5.0,Very cute purse I like the style. Good material. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the C looks like a G so you can truly tell it‚Äôs a knock off.
5.0,"It's OK for the price, but fatter then I thought.  works good"
5.0,This top is beautiful. It feels good to the touch. Smells because of the plastic but fads relatively quickly..
5.0,I love these glasses.  I love the fit and the look.

5.0,"This ring is perfect!! I liked it so much I bought it twice! I put my engagement ring in the middle and bookended it with this beautiful ring in either side. It's dainty and gorgeous. I love sac silver, their sterling rings are my favorite, you can't beat the quality for the price! And it's always been true to size."
5.0,"I  love how it fits my body. I used it for the gym, I loved it I ordered a set of three for my daughter,"
5.0,Bodysuit fitted very well! Awesome quality for such a low price. Many con goers gave me a lot compliments :)
5.0,"Bought this for a costume party and felt great in it. I feel it's well made for a costume. Definitely better quality than most Spirit stuff, but not necessarily the quality you might expect of actual clothing. Still, a great product for the price. Personally, I wanted the pink, but couldn't get the pink shoes I wanted in time for a party. I like this enough that I'll probably buy the pink version as well. It really is a well done costume."
5.0,"I bought the for my nephew, who likes superheroes a lot but can not decide on just one :)<br />Very, very cute - I'm glad I bought them, I'm quite sure he will like it :) !"
5.0,My husband loves this clip-on eye glass case. It even closes so the glasses don't fall out 10 stars.
5.0,"Pendant had a substantial sterling bezel set mounting, and the stone was large.  Stone was a bit dark in color, but nicely cut and sparkly.  I ordered an identical one in emerald, it was such a good value."

5.0,"I love it, it's the perfect size and super cute for my lanyard."
5.0,Love love this.  My daughter gave me the hipster and I needed the wallet to match!
5.0,"Super cute and very squishy. It feels like it would take a lot to break (which is a good thing) but because it's sticky, it gets dirty extreamly fast. Other then that, it's fun ‚ú®"
5.0,This is a very high-quality product fits my son who is eight years old he absolutely loves it
5.0,Super cute. The tassels are not well made but it's so cheap and with hand washing I should get a few months out of it before they are done. Will be perfect for our cruise
5.0,"All functions work as advertised, but the light could be a little better."
5.0,So these are probably the only thing I will wear to work or during COVID with. It‚Äôs easy to breathe in and it doesn‚Äôt seem like it is all that bad at protecting others. I‚Äôll probably get 5 more because it‚Äôs also great for biking.
5.0,Very Happy with the product & their Prompt Service.
5.0,This was my second pair of Vionic sandals.  They are so comfortable!

5.0,"love the material, way it fits..love it!!!"
5.0,"These are hands down the best, easiest, and most creative way to make a quick, attractive window valence on a tight budget for a light, boho-chic look.<br /><br />The adjustable straps are perfect for sizing to any window and giving that dreamy look. I cannot tell you how many compliments I've gotten and just how accomplished I feel to have what looks like an expensive, handmade valence on each window in my house, and cleaning is easy, though I recommend hand washing for chiffon fabrics.<br /><br />I cannot recommend these more highly to light up your home!"

5.0,"Really nice light weight shorts I plan on using to kayak and to just wear out shopping.  They look nice! And have enough pockets for everyone's needs.  I got my normal size XL, but they fit a little bit too tight or maybe I was hoping that XL would fit. I was in between sizes so went with my usual size. Not returning, cause I plan on losing some weight and they will fit nicely.  Will definitly order again."

5.0,So many hats are poor made this is one of the better made I have purchased
5.0,"These took me a long time to attach to my sunglasses (just because the sunglasses arms were a bit wide at the end) but once I put them on they did not budge. I wore these in Hawaii for hikes, on the beach, and even in super high winds and they kept my glasses secure even though I couldn‚Äôt even feel that the straps were there because they were so light! Highly recommend. I got the blue geometric pattern and it was cute without being too over the top."
5.0,I love this swimsuit!
5.0,Beautiful figure flattering
5.0,"This fine piece of jewelry was exactly what I want in a Thor's hammer. I wanted something heavy, stylish with character and its exactly what I wanted. I haven't taken it off since I got it for close to no money it is a very good pendant. Its heavy enough to notice but not to heavy and the design of Celtic type knots are very well done. I was very impressed by this piece! Definitely worth it. =]"
5.0,"I loved it delivered on time fit great,"
5.0,Is too long for my height
5.0,not for hiking.
5.0,"Best dress for All your events! Perfect flow, great fabic.. Love it!"

5.0,Great fit<br />Keeps me dry while working in the field<br />Durable material
5.0,"They keep my sons hands warm in the snow, his hands actually stay much warmer than mine with gloves on. So I am super happy about that! Also he occasionally likes to take off his gloves when we are just walking around, He tries to toss them out of his stroller because he thinks it funny.  But the joke is on him now, these aren‚Äôt going anywhere!"

5.0,Had these for 2 weeks now & so far so good. There were a little snug at first but after the second day fit fine. I usually wear a thicker sock with them.
5.0,This is one of my favorite new pieces of jewelry. I love the color combination and the size of the beads. It isnt to heavy or weighty so I don't feel weighed down if i wear it for a long time. It just flows well with my outfits I wear. It lays nicely around my neck and doesn't irritate or bother my skin at all. It's a very comfortable necklace to wear. The colors are so rich and pretty. They are soft yet deep and make the clothes I wear look so much better. The clasp is well put together and very sturdy. You can just see the quality as soon as you open the beautifully decorated gift box. I am so happy I was able to get this it is just wonderful. I love it so much.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price for an honest and unbiased review.

5.0,I like this more than I thought I would!  It's comfy
5.0,"I purchased my first Fossil while I was overseas. So, it had some sentimental value. When it broke, I was crushed and I tried to replace it.

5.0,"Very comfortable, and able to accommodate my long hair up in a pineapple. I rarely wear headbands or barrettes because they hurt my head, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could handle sleeping in an elastic cap. But it is just the right size for my noggin so it barely has to stretch when in place. Keeps the curls from frizzing and tangling overnight. Not thrilled with the super bright colors but if they work this well I‚Äôll survive."
5.0,"Beautiful color, fits great. Very flattering cut. Would order one in every color!"
5.0,I love wearing this necklace

5.0,"This Bluetooth beanie worked right out of the box.<br />Both the BT and LED light were operational from the moment it was unpacked, how great! I'm sure it could stand to be charged fully, but was excited to learn I could at least try it out from minute one. Included is  USB charging cord, and a sheet of extremely simple directions.<br />LED was a lot brighter than I anticipated! This one small, hands-free light shines up a large area, and clicks off/on by the way of touch from a single button centered in the middle of light. It's nice that it was designed as to not have to fumble between, or get it confused with the BT functions!<br />BT works as it should, sound was clear and crisp. No more buds and no more having to remove for conversations. Wonderful!<br />As for the beanie itself, it's warm and tight knit. No loose or lackluster knitting for cold air to enter. Another glorious bonus! Have not yet been able to test how long it works on full charge, but I'd wager it is at least enough hours to get through a day of activity.<br />From what I know so far, I think this deserves to be recommended and is worthy of ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ.<br />Great design!"
5.0,"I liked it, looking so cool"
5.0,"Love , love love this product. Fits perfect. Looks classy. Easy to adjust band"
5.0,Beautiful dress and well made!
5.0,The special deal on this jewelry was to awesome to imagine but the quality of this gorgeous piece blew me away! I bought 2 as gifts and the receivers were so impressed with the beauty quality and style of this gorgeous piece of work. Everyone who saw it just loved it! The chain was sturdy and just as nice as the butterfly pendant. Some places will give you a cheaper quality chain than that of the actual pendant. Everything matched well. Such a lovely piece of jewelry. Thank you for the special deal on it!
5.0,"I got these as a gift, and I was VERY skeptical. But I was blown away at how much they help while driving‚Äînow I won‚Äôt go anywhere without them.<br />I had been having more difficulty driving at night. Not sure if it‚Äôs the newer super-bright headlights or if I‚Äôm just getting older (I‚Äôm only 41!), but I felt like I was blinded by oncoming traffic or if a lifted pickup truck was behind me. It was particularly bad if I was tired or had a migraine.<br />These glasses make a tremendous difference. They don‚Äôt dim any of the lights, they just make them more tolerable. I‚Äôd compare it to the difference between a loud fingernails-on-the-chalkboard sound and a more pleasant, but still loud sound. The oncoming lights are still bright, they‚Äôre just not piercingly blinding.<br />I realized today that I‚Äôve had them for nearly two years, and they are still in excellent shape. I‚Äôve been through several pairs of similarly priced sunglasses in that time. The frames are solid, and the lenses are resilient (there‚Äôs one tiny little scratch).<br />I wear these every time I drive at night. They‚Äôre great for overcast days too.<br />I can‚Äôt stress it enough‚Äîif you suffer from eye-fatigue or if driving at night has gotten difficult, YOU NEED THESE GLASSES!!!"
5.0,Great sunglasses. Great price.
5.0,"I clearly had a read fail moment since it says the dimensions, but I was expecting a larger bottle. Nonetheless, this item is just as described and insanely adorable and awesome. I love the poop out of it.<br />I will be taking the suggestion from another reviewer and adding additional adhesive to the top to make sure the cork doesn't pop off. I'll also be sealing the label some more since it looks like it might just be a bit of Mod Podge and it may peel easily or wear from any moisture."
5.0,Great fit! Just what I expected.
5.0,Nice and comfy!
5.0,"Good fun bracelets. Great for teens and tweens. Good materials, solidly built.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask‚Ä¶ Thank you!"

I'm a huge Nike person, but hate spending $80+ on some silly stretchy pants. I've always wanted to try Lulu but can't ever bring myself to spend that much on some. The only reason I purchased these leggings is because I was like $5 away from free shipping so i bought these and decided to give them a chance. Definitely high quality material, and they're THICK which is amazing.. definitely going to be purchasing more!!!"

5.0,This necklace was beautiful and of good quality. I really liked the bead chain. It may not be for some people but I really thought it was a nice touch. It is a quality well made necklace. It Doesn't seem frail or as if it would snap easily. I've worn it several times and it's still going strong. In addition I'm always concerned with plated things fading or wearing off but so far the necklace shows no signs of discoloration. Great buy for the price!
5.0,Only one word PERFECT! Is Brand new and genuine!!!
5.0,"Got these to where with my boots this fall. I do have thicker calves and have had no issue with these.

5.0,"I love these boots!  They are my first pair of Fryes and I'm so pleased.  I couldn't pass up this price!  I usually wear size 6.5 and went with a 7 for these.  I did not find them to be too narrow, but I don't think my feet are especially wide to begin with.  I was a little afraid the color would be too dark after reading some of the other reviews but that was not the case.  They were just what I expected from looking at the picture.  I also purchased the Frye weatherproofing cream and they look even better after applying it.  I wasn't in love with the laces, as they're leather too and I just don't care for the way they feel, so I'll be switching them out.  Looking forward to a lifetime with these boots (and more Fryes in the future)."
5.0,"Better tham expected. Comfy, warm, perftect."

5.0,"I got three different pair of Ohpink earrings, and I have to say in all three cases, these earrings are prettier in real life than their pictures. They are nicely made, have cute designs, and are simply very pretty earrings. These are much nicer than what I was expecting. I love the designs and the stones are just enough without being too much.<br /><br />I cannot judge the hypoallergenic/sensitive ear quality of the hooks, because I switch all hooks out to niobium or titanium due to allergies to certain metals.<br /><br />I can‚Äôt say much more than if you think these are cute in the pictures, go for it, because they are much nicer in real life. Very pleased with the look and quality of these earrings.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

5.0,I love these sweaters.  They are very comfortable but look good. You can dress them up. Or just wear them as leisure wear<br /> After buying one I bought 4 more.
5.0,"After several tries, I finally was able to obtain the correct replacement band for my fitness tracker. I had to go on to my phone to open the app for my tracker to locate the right model. I didn‚Äôt realize how many different options there are. Had I done this step first, I would have saved myself a lot of stress."
5.0,"This nursing cap fit very well on my head, material very soft, easily to apply, kept my head warm at night<br />while working and easy to attach the mask to the  two side buttons. Got lots of compliment. Purchase navy blue . Its pricey, but I like it."
5.0,"I bought the shirt stays for a Black and White affair and with first use, one of the clasps broke. Not good.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and was provided an immediate replacement. I‚Äôm going to chalk the first product as an isolated incident."
5.0,Simply the best.

5.0,Fits great & protects good.
5.0,My mom is in to all things tie dye and she was only missing socks and a bra to make her outfit complete so I got her these. She loved them. They fit her well. The material is ok I guess just feels cheap but they r only wore on occasion so it works for her.
5.0,"Great Light weight jacket, bought for my dad and brother and they have both used only this jacket for an NC winter, which is cold but COLD."
5.0,Fits great! Looks great!
5.0,these work very well! the first time i went to disney a few of my pins fell off or got stolen off my bag. i was furious since most pins are quite pricey (around 10-15 dollars each) i was going again this past spring and wanted my pins to be secure while they were on my bag. this changed my life! they are absolutely amazing and don‚Äôt come off at all! ive tried pulling them off and they won‚Äôt even budge. they are so very good and i definitely recommend for the price!
5.0,"I got this for my teenaged son to wear to school, and he loves it! The fit is spot on, it looks great on him. And the color gradient from top to bottom adds just the right amount of style to keep it interesting. Good quality material too, I'd recommend it."
5.0,Well worth the price.
5.0,So pretty and it fits perfectly!
5.0,"These are the most comfortable yoga pants ever. The fabric is a little thin. I run hot though, so it is just perfect for me. They are the perfect fit, and they look very good. I wore them to work in place of my slacks the other day, and no one even noticed that they were yoga pants. The are very mobile also.

5.0,Perfect shirt that contours your curves but does not make anyone look big.
5.0,I had to buy a pair of these when my riding boots were too high. I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of this product. They're made of study foam and they come in 4 pieces. You can add additional height to the pair. I wore them with my boots and they were comfortable and soft. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to discreetly add an inch or 2 to their height.
5.0,"These socks are great, especially when running outdoors in the heat. They are not too hot, in fact actually seem to be cooling. They fit true to size. They are super soft and comfortable. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,looked as picture showed.
5.0,I love this shirt! It‚Äôs a great feel and perfect size fitting for me!
5.0,"I got these so I could brush a Maine Coon with wicked, lightning-fast claws.  They work like a dream and have even allowed me to desensitize him to brushing to the point he now just lays on the bed, purring up a storm.<br /><br />I also share them with my vet to help when examining him, since he's been known to snag a few hands."

5.0,"I was a skeptical person regarding this product, I really wasn't sure if it could hold everything I carry with me in that tiny purse but it's holding up well and the front pocket holds my bulky cell phone with case (not the iPhone 6+ but just as big) and I must say it's doing a good job! I might buy another style later!"
5.0,Love my band.  Classy looking and very well made.
5.0,Very cool and comfortable. Looks more expensive than it is. Very pleasantly surprised.
5.0,Updated review- this cover up is beautiful. Just as pictured. After one wear the threads started falling apart and I was devastated! The company reached out to me and replaced it no questions asked! It is a beautiful item and I'm so pleased with their service I'm going to purchase it in other colors.
5.0,Very good quality fits perfect
5.0,Cute as a gift
5.0,I ordered this for my daughter and she and her husband loved it.  They both loved the Dr. Seuss pattern and my daughter is crazy about the retro style.  So am I and I ordered another one for me.  ...Miss Dee

5.0,baught it for my daughter. She loves it
5.0,it was as described
5.0,I bought 3 of these tops as I had purchased on earlier and loved the fabric.  To my surprise all three of these were different fabric.  So disappointing.  I gave 5 stars to this as was the fabric I liked
5.0,Fantastic value! Not a duplicate in sight. I counted them there were 100. Only one out of one hundred was broken. Worth  your money.

5.0,I love this scarf! Very pretty!
5.0,I love this hoody. It's pretty thick and looks nice. It's a lil ok the small size so you should definitely go one or two sizes up
5.0,This dress is very flattering and true to size! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 180lbs and a large fit like a glove. It is a bit on the short side but the dress hugs enough that it won‚Äôt slide up.
5.0,I was a little nervous about the fit of this dress but pleasently surprised! Really love it! 5‚Äô8‚Äù 150 lbs and the medium is perfect!<br />35<br />29<br />39
5.0,This romper/dress was absolutely gorgeous. I purchased it to wear for my birthday on April 7th for a cruise. It fits perfectly and looks so elegant. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it because I know heads will be turning. I would suggest wearing a flesh color bra as to the fact the top is shear and see through. STUNNING!!!
5.0,"I bought this for my hubby as a birthday present, and he absolutely loved it - so did his friends! It looks as good as the picture!"
5.0,I like the glasses and the cases are a nice addition.  I like to buy several and keep them all around the house.
5.0,This is my fav outfit now
5.0,Son hermosos para los reci√©n nacidos lo √∫nico malo es que la manitas son muy grande para un beb√© reci√©n nacido
5.0,"i love the dress, however the top was a little snug. I have a size 36 c bra size. The length hit right above my knees. You will have to wear a nude bra with this because you can see through the middle."
5.0,Arrived timely and as advertised.  No issues with product.
5.0,cute and usable.  great for kids and dog lovers.
5.0,Beautiful dress. Sleeves were a little tight but overall great purchase.  Very comfortable.

5.0,Perfect item. Strong hold. Would buy again!
5.0,"Love love love these gloves! They are great for gardening, anything that you‚Äôd need to protect your hands and general use. The touchscreen option is fantastic, so glad I do t have to take off my gloves to change a song , podcast or answer a call or text. Highly recommend these!"
5.0,Very Nice Shirt - Husband loved it for Biking on a could day in Florida :)
5.0,I've been wearing the necklace everyday since I got it. It holds up really well even in the shower.  It's not turning me green and not getting scratched up.<br /><br />Daddy says the keychain is great too! We love this set.  üíï
5.0,"Every aspect of this watch shrieks ""quality."" From the high quality deployment band to the hour markers and the display back that lets you see the beautiful movement. This has all the elements of a $10,000+ watch at a tiny fraction of the cost. Hard not to love that recipe."
5.0,They were gifts and it was very lovely. Thanks.
5.0,These were exactly what I needed. My kids are no longer loosing mittens. They stay attached unless you try to pull mittens off.
5.0,This chain is so nice and can be worn over any top. it is sturdy and looks just like the photo. The price is great and style is very unique - love'n it!
5.0,Wanted a lightweight soft keychain to go with my new classic Mini Cooper... it‚Äôs perfect! Great quality

5.0,"Gift for daughter, perfect fit and length. Ordered petite, medium, perfect for flats and flip flops ."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d8c4f5e41993461a3bc92c1dd628e2f6]] This silver bangle is nice although it's small or maybe my wrist is just too small for it since the opening it quite wide. It measures 6 inches. It's hard and sturdy.<br /><br />I bought it in silver color although it comes in different colors. The bangle seem to be of good quality as the thickness is just right as well as its weight. Also, it comes in a very impressive gift box! This is great as a gift!<br /><br />I like to color coordinate my accessories and the silver color fits on any accessories. Overall, its a nice bangle to have.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest/unbiased review during its promotional period. All thoughts, opinions and ratings are my own. I was under no obligation to post positive feedback. I am simply sharing my opinions the same as I would have if purchasing the item at full price. I will update my review as soon as I encounter some issues with the product."
5.0,"The colour and fit were what I expected, based on the photos and description."
5.0,Shorts too short
5.0,"Sizing was spot on with what I expected. The rhinestone things remove from the lingerie, to allow for easy wash. I was very happy with my purchase. It did arrive quickly, and as with all lingerie, was in a plastic clear bag, non-retail."
5.0,Love it and very comfortable
5.0,Glasses fit perfectly. Cleaning cloth does the job. Very happy with everything.
5.0,"Great looking shorts, especially for slim guys. I wear a 29 (sometimes 28) in most pants/jeans, and the 29 fits me perfectly. No excess material (hate the baggy look). They hug my contours without being so tight they're indecent, lol.<br /><br />The multi-colored icons add a playful yet understated touch. They're small enough that people look closer to see just what they are (mine are a horse and rider).  So... I've got people leaning over to gaze at my shorts? Hmmm!<br /><br />I got compliments from both my bf and from ladies at our club. I may have to buy more colors!"
5.0,"Gift for my daughter in law she just love it, you guys are the best.."
5.0,Demasiado linda. Queda perfecta en la mu√±eca
5.0,I bought this dress for my mother's funeral. She would have loved it on me. It's a nice dress. It was pretty slimming (I'm not a small girl) even though the bodice is quite fitted. I am quite pleased with my purchase.
5.0,I purchased these for showing at the gym and they are perfect for this.
5.0,"My 3.5 year old daughter loves these mittens, can put them on herself, and hasn't lost them yet thanks to the vibrant color. When she takes them off after playing outdoors her hands are warm."
5.0,I‚Äôm SOOO in love with this purse!!! It has a professional look so I look the par for business meetings!!
5.0,"I love this pink small crossbody. I bought this as gift for a teenager and she love it , as it is plain one,  I embroidered her name on it and the more beauty it added. Sorry don‚Äôt have the picture but it‚Äôs worth buy( if it‚Äôs help u pls give  üëç)"
5.0,You can use this as an outer shirt in summer when walking or running.  In the winter you can were this as another layer under a sweater or shirt.<br />Dries quickly and colors are beautiful.
5.0,"It looks really neat when on, it‚Äôs comfy and good quality."
5.0,Absolutely adore these plugs. Fit and look casual but classy. Unisex styling. Nice lil weight to them So watch out for unintended upsizing of your lobe if u wear them continuously...I recommend adding these lil babies to your plug collection but not falling asleep in them...u will lose them in your sheets and feel bad for lil bit but get excited a week later when u come across the 'get away' plug under the bed in 'where everything gets lost land'...they may be double flared but that's no match for your pillows or tangled blankets around your cranium. The metaphysical properties of these stones are magical beyond belief. Great mantra. Spreads positive chi and good vibes only around these babies. Don't forget u can charge/cleanse these with your normal healing stones. Being stones and natural at that they do absorb toxic and negative energies that need warding off...a thunderstorm or clean rainwater and fresh h2o should rid any negativity they end up holding on to. Careful w strong chemicals on them. Since they are natural stone u wouldn't want them erode or deteriorate from something u cleaned or sanitized them w. Anti bacterial soap and warm water is all you need and that'll do the the trick. Best for healed piecings. Enjoy.
5.0,"Nice quality, solid and heavy. My boyfriend likes it on me."
5.0,"Great product! Needed a salmon pink tie for my son, this color was in between pink and peach and worked perfectly. Beautiful set, we only needed the necktie, but glad we had the option of bow tie as well. Great price, glad I chose Amazon for this!"
5.0,"Boyfriend loved it! Ive has it for a year, and I still randomly pull it out for fun :)<br /><br />I'm 5'3, 117 lb. 34 b/c and I got a small.<br /><br />Would recommend."
5.0,great brand fits well
5.0,"This bag has been used for a while, Frist of all, it is real leather and very thick, good quality, reasonable price, and the color is my favorite. Love it."
5.0,They are so comfortable and cute!
5.0,"LOVE IT!<br />It is the most I have ever spent on a watch, but it was so worth every penny.<br />The Analog syncs with the digital time that you set.<br />Has glow in the dark analog, which i'm pretty sure it doesn't saw that in the review.<br />Digital very easy to read, also easy to set and understand the watch programming.<br />The only thing not good is the light. Can't read the digital with it, and doesn't light up evenly."
5.0,Love this bathing suit! Was definitely one of my favorites on my recent trip to Tulum. Highly recommend.
5.0,After machine clean this cloth buffs out anything left but was very expensive
5.0,Great quality and color variety for a great price. The colors match a large range of dress shirts.
5.0,"Love the materials, good finish puma quality. nice."
5.0,"Very cute dress, perfect for a fall barn wedding reception! Daughter loves it!!"
5.0,This bag is perfect for me and the price is very good. It has a lot more than the website shows.
5.0,"Was delivered by expected date. Thicker than I thought it'd be! Not heavy. I ordered a large, though I usually wear a small and it fits perfectly. The arms are exactly the right length, so if you're a &#34;wear em long&#34; kind of sleeve person, this may not work for you. The outer fabric is REALLY soft, like a microfiber. The inner material is fluffy and also very soft. My young niece felt the coat and described it as &#34;cozy&#34; and she's exactly right! Wish I could speak to how durable this coat is, but I've yet to test it out for the season. Will come back with more after the fact."
5.0,Good as per the description
5.0,Scale was exactly like in the show. It worked perfectly!
5.0,A little to dark but I can get by
5.0,"My boyfriend and I each bought a pair of these suspenders to wear to EDC LV. They were perfect! He had his blinking the whole night while I mostly kept mine solidly lit up. The batteries lasted from 10pm through to 6am when I turned them off. They still had more life left in them. The suspenders were comfortable to wear and were adjustable for different lengths. The battery pack was easy to get to on my back and I had no problems changing settings myself while wearing them. I would highly recommend these to anyone.<br /><br />I must note that when our two pairs first arrived, one pair worked perfectly and the other wouldn't stay lit. I contacted the seller right and not only did they immediately send me a replacement, but they also explained how I could probably easily fix the one I already had. The suspenders worked perfect once I did the easy fix, so now I have an extra pair! The seller was awesome and I will definitely buy from them again."
5.0,Everything about this dress was great. Nice quality too!
5.0,Bag arrived quickly and was exactly as it was described :)
5.0,Very nice leather purse. I got the black one and I think this purse is a good size. The leather is very nice. It fits plenty of your things in there that you need to carry with you all the time. I like the length of the straps. It's just right to hang it on your shoulders without it being too long or too short. I would recommend it to a friend. I'm very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />I received this purse at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,Very nice.  Would<br />Recommend it for the ballerina lover.
5.0,I've gotten tons of compliments on these! They're cute and comfortable and perfect for summer.
5.0,"Beautiful, and feels nice."
5.0,I got this for my wife along with a border collie pendant by the same seller. It looks exactly the same as the picture. Very shiny and well made. I paired it with a stainless steel rope chain and it looks beautiful. It's a very elegant way of showing off your amazing dog breed without a corny bumper sticker. I looked everywhere online for dog breed specific jewelry but this is the only place I could find with such a wide selection and great quality.<br />I definitely recommend these to any german shepherd owners. My wife absolutely loves hers.
5.0,I got this to give to my daughter on her first Mother's Day this year It is very pretty--just as described. It is small so do not be looking for a huge pendant.  I know she will love it. It came very quickly and I had no problems at all.
5.0,"The fabric quality and printing is very good, and sizing was perfect!"
5.0,"I have a big head and alot of hair so I had my doubts but hands down this was worth it, it's got got materials it fits perfectly and it's f***in Anime"
5.0,"Love Love Love these! So comfortable! They are delicate (wish they were a bit thicker, I‚Äôm so afraid of bending them) but make statement! Can not beat the price!"
5.0,Came early and was just what we wanted!
5.0,Beautiful lines and color  A bit warmer than I expected
5.0,This is the cutest swimsuit. The product looked even better in person than on the website.<br /><br />The design is very impressive. I didn't expect it to look so intricate.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that the materiel does not stretch at all.
5.0,Lovely sweater catch
5.0,I have quite a few Olukai shoes.... counted on the sizing being the same and it was!  These are really comfortable and cute.
5.0,Gave these as a Christmas gift. She loved them.
5.0,"These earrings are beautiful. I love the little dainty pottery flowers.  They are a nice weight, and not too heavy.  I first bought the lavender ones and I liked them so much, I also bought the red ones.  The reds ones are very festive and I have worn them several times through the holidays although I am sure I will wear them throughout the rest of the year also."
5.0,I‚Äôm a big guy and this fits perfectly. I see happy faces when the kids see me wearing this awesome apron.
5.0,"It's hard to buy clothes online that fit nice, but this dress fits the bill. It's very comfortable. I am 4'10&#34; and 120 pounds. Because I'm a bit &#34;large&#34; up top, I always go with a size large, I maybe could have gotten away with a medium but I like roomy, comfortable clothes. I washed the dress once so far and ironed the skirt, and it still &#34;flares&#34; out nicely."
5.0,Been searching all over for these under tanks! Dry fit.. stretchy .. nice!
5.0,Super cute love the design. The red is not red like the pictures people posted. It's way more pinkish. But still cute. I got black and red. Comes in a box for safe delivery.
5.0,I Love Rainbow Brite.  These are fun socks to have as an adult. Reminds me to de-stress and enjoy the smaller things in life.
5.0,Very pretty and flowy dress. Color is spot on. Pretty coral color. I am 175 5‚Äô4 and I normally wears a 10/Lrg but I ordered a med and that still was a little big but nothing that would make me want to return it. Sleeves a too long but i scrunched it up and kept it moving. Washes well and hung to dry. Actually ordered another and waiting on delivery.
5.0,Have been buying this product for quite some time. For both daughters. Love the quality and the look. Good for summer even for a rainy fall day. I think it runs a little big. Prefer the leather without the perforated sides.
5.0,Love it! unfortunately I broke it in the first week.
5.0,One of the best things I ever ordered! Fit was great and it was a hit at the xmas jammie party!!!!
5.0,Got these for my grandson and he was happy with them. They were a good fit and he said they were comfortable.
5.0,My daughters favorite thing she received for Christmas !
5.0,"A perfect fit, which frankly surprised me. I love this shirt."
5.0,Very comfortable. My husband said it looks like something his grandmother would wear. LOL
5.0,I recommend you is good product.
5.0,Great belt!!
5.0,"Let's start with the basics, 5'3&#34;, 125lbs, 32c, proportional. I loved this dress, I wore it with the beige heels pictured, but it also looks good with flat sandals. You can see where it hits for my height. The fabric was thick enough to not be transparent( although I always suggest nude unders with this kind of stuff) and it didn't make me look like a small elephant( some unfitted dresses can do that to me if they are too stiff). Great price, great fit, lots of compliments."
5.0,Fits great!! I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase!! I‚Äôve gotten a little belly and it hides it well!!!
5.0,Love the earrings and the size.  Just as I expected--will wear them often.
5.0,Great belt with cargo shorts or pants. All the other belts I used looked a little out of place. This one is perfect.
5.0,These were a hit at Christmas time for the girls goody bags. They wore them everyday after Christmas.
5.0,Fits on my 6 year daughter perfectly. Kids gonna love it.
5.0,"Its great material,It fit as expected. I love the color!"
5.0,My son love this PJ Masks pajamas!
5.0,bride was ecstatic! And beautiful!
5.0,"Absolutely love this cover-up! It was exactly what I was looking for. I'm TALL, 5'10&#34;, and the fringe comes to my knees, so it's a good length! Very sheer, but in a good way. I'm also a plus size (18-20) and it was a good fit. I think if you are larger it would still work for you! You will love it! Looks great with a black suit!"
5.0,"This is a great throw-on and go summer dress. I purchased a size large, I'm 9'9"" 160lbs and it fits great. The dress comes right below my ankles, so I only wear flat sandals. It may be too short for some that prefer longer maxi dresses.  The waistline is higher than I prefer (not quite as high as an empire waist line, more like a crop top).  The material feels similar to a heavy poly/cotton t-shirt but it's rayon. It washes well (do not put in the dryer) and all-in-all is a super cute and comfy maxi dress."
5.0,They are as described.
5.0,I now know where my dog is at all times when she moves
5.0,Random draw on charms. Nice quality Croc charms.  Kids enjoyed them.
5.0,Fits as predicted and very comfy.
5.0,"As I am a &#34;fluffy girl&#34;, These are a little snug around my bottom-nothing uncomfortable. I just like my clothes to be a bit loose. I wear long shirts with these to cover this issue. I get lots of compliments on these! Lovely color, great material (so soft), and very cool for this hot GA weather (June). Be warned that the high points on the sides come to about my knees (I am 5'7&#34; if that helps) and the longer part of the legs comes to below my ankles. I do not step on them. I do get them caught under the wheels of my office chair, though. ^_^<br />I would recommend these to others."
5.0,Very cute necklace. It‚Äôs not as big as on as but it‚Äôs still cute
5.0,"Perfect size, and adjustable. Fits my medium to large head very well. Very warm and substantial. Great value for the price."

5.0,Fabulous quality!
5.0,Love them. Very comfortable. Hold shape and don‚Äôt roll. Will be buying more.
5.0,Great!!  Was a gift and she loved them - very vibrant!!
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this set! The stones are a bit darker than they appear in the picture but it in NO way takes away from just how beautiful it is. I thought it was going to be sort of a light weight flimsy set for the price, but NO, there is some weight to them. They fit beautifully, true to size. I wish I found this set years ago. I recommend this set to anyone looking for something beautiful and different!"
5.0,They are very comfortable and so soft
5.0,"Dress is not true to size, order a smaller size for a perfect fit."
5.0,"The coziest workout sweatpants i own.<br />These are stretchy, comfortable, warm, and they have the unique ability to be dressed up or down. These are my favorite go-to sweatpants to wear to school on my off days as well as my favorite pair of workout pants when I'm looking to jump out of bed and get exercising because I know that they will keep me warm enough."
5.0,I got SO many complements! It was very comfy and warm!
5.0,"Very impressed, nice fit and comfortable. Looking to get a larger pair for my husband."
5.0,Love this necklace. Great price and does not look cheap.
5.0,"I liked this shirt a lot. It is soft and the image is a nice quality. Unfortunately it was too small on me. I am normally a small but I think for this I should have gotten a medium. As reference to my size I am normally a size 2-4 in clothes, so I suggest ordering a size up, especially if you put your clothes in the dryer."
5.0,Looked great on my grand daughter
5.0,"I love it very much!! It is just like the model shown. The blue is a bit dark, when I first open it I though I got a black, but it is indeed blue if you look it directly under the light. Very pretty!!"

5.0,The only thing i didnt like was the white part in the dress but other than that it fits nice
5.0,Very cute and colorful earrings! Nice quality and well made.  Perfect for my costume and colorful Ms Frizzle outfit.
5.0,"These insoles - gooood.  I wear them all the time - including in my slippers I wear around the house. What a difference! All are good - but for this painful season of my life, this pair is the best! These inserts helped to eliminate the problem.<br />Plantar Fasciitis - bad. I really love these inserts! These inserts make it possible for me to wear MANY shoes I would ordinarily not be able to wear, and are much more comfortable and far less expensive than orthotics. Sometimes I use them alone, and sometimes I put them under the removable insole that comes in the shoe and wear them both. I was having problems with my arch and the ball of my feet when working out. They provide both cushion and arch support for my very flat feet and I LOVE them!  These are the ones I prefer."
5.0,"I love these things! I work out in them, hike in them and would live in them if I could! They are multi functional and look great!"
5.0,Good transaction
5.0,"Our daughter used this costume to play Sandy (Annie's Dog) in her schools production of &quot;Little Orphan Annie Jr.&quot; The crowd loved the costume, as did our daughter."
5.0,"Is as described, and arrived as expected.  It does not totally block out in extremely bright sunlight, but is manageable, and they work really week in lower duck light and at night.  Durable and is worth the price."
5.0,Love them a lot
5.0,Super cute!!! My son is very tall for his age and the shorts were long on him but surfer cute long. And he is very slim so the 3t was perfect and held up when running around a splashpad.
5.0,"Perfect fit, loved it the material is nice"
5.0,Looks Great!
5.0,Nice scarf but a little on the small side. Very silky and great pattern.
5.0,Appearance is great.
5.0,Love these comfy socks ! I wear a size 10 shoe and these fit great. I plan to buy more plus some as gifts !
5.0,"The dress was beautiful and fit just as expected.  I got an email asking for more specific measurements for hem length, to take into account if the dress would be worn with heels.  I am very pleased with this dress."
5.0,loved these the first time i bought them.. now i have a back up pair! they are very stylish

5.0,"very good quality, excellent price"
5.0,"Today I just received the pants for my three-year-old son. The delivery was slow. The color and the quality are as the same as the advertisement. In spite of the slow delivery, I still give it five stars because of it's nice color and good quality."
5.0,"Great dress! Easy to wear, flattering, doesn't wrinkle and sooo cute! Just get it!!"
5.0,My Granddaughter was so happy best present
5.0,"When I pulled these out of the package I thought &#34;I've made a terrible mistake&#34;. There was no way these things were going to stretch across my 43-inch hips, let alone leave anything to the imagination. But stretch they did. Not only do they fit like a glove and feel amazing, but... wait for it... they aren't see-through. *choir sings hallelujah* My well-endowed sisters will understand how hard it is to find leggings that fit - you either have to go too big and get baggy ankles and waist, or the butt stretches so tight that all your business is on display. These do neither. I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW. Now granted, I haven't washed them yet. They might fall apart on first use. But I'm going to take sweet care of these babies and make sure they last as long as possible."
5.0,This sock fits well and runs true to size. They did shrink just a tad in the dryer on low heat but I simply gave them a gentle stretch and they went right back to their original size. I will definitely be ordering these again when needed.
5.0,I couldnt find this shirt anywhere and took a chance with Amazon because its iffy with band teeshirts. But it fits well and hasnt faded. I got a large and its definitely a large.
5.0,Perfect length for a baby bump! Super comfy! Im 5ft and about 36 weeks preggo :)
5.0,Fits perfect!  Easy traveling dressüòä
5.0,"Beautiful dress, fits comfortably and true to size."
5.0,Great Lulu dupe!!! Great quality and fit.
5.0,Did a good job making my gold shiny.
5.0,These gorgeous bangle bracelets are absolutely perfect for any outfit and really bring an elegant effect to this classic look.<br /><br />These bracelets came in a cute little burlap bag which seems like such a nice touch for gift giving.  The first thing I noticed was how heavy and well made these bangles are.  They did not warp or bend with putting them or through wear.  The other thing that I noticed was how beautifully designed they are.  They have a nice pattern that lightly accents the overall look of them.  Definitely a great new accessory!<br /><br />Definitely recommend!
5.0,I get compliments all the time! Love this color and everything about the bag and wallet! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
5.0,"I purchased this adorable pajamama set to donate to a needy family so I haven't seen it on a child but the quality of the material is excellent and the design is, well, adorable.  I imagine this will look very cute on a little one."

5.0,Everyone loves them
5.0,"My boyfriend loves these! He wears them all the time, golfing or driving it doesn't matter. The silver and black goes with anything."
5.0,Watches good great in the case.  Quiet motors. Ordering a second winder soon.<br /><br />Recommend this product.
5.0,I used it for storing cash and cards. Note that it's not big enough to store a passport; you'll end up deforming the passport if you can even make it fit. Be sure to store any cash or cards in a plastic sandwich bag; this is in case your leg gets wet for any reason.
5.0,"It's beautiful goes with winter or summer depending on the color you pick,  I got red.  It's big and roomy, but not to big!  Perfect mom purse."
5.0,"Feels nice & looks adorable, some threading issues where the end of threads were hanging but I just made sure they were knotted and cut them off"
5.0,What an amazing choice in colors and craftsmanship.
5.0,This bag is great! I absolutely love it! It was just as expected! Its big enough & the color looks just like the pic. I would definitely buy another maybe in another color!

5.0,Great shirt easy to wash
5.0,Hot hot hot
5.0,"Second suit I orderded after searching for hours. Fits great, love the material and design, and you get what is pictured! (Unlike the first suit I ordered) I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />Note: Is also good for flat-chested."

5.0,It works just like it says it does!<br />Opens and closes easy.<br />Cute colors
5.0,"I purchased size L. Arm pit to arm pit is around 39 inch. It is smaller compared to size chart. This was supposed to be a gift for my friend. However, it is too small. I fell in love with the design so I decided to keep it for myself even though it is big for me. Great hoodie. A little bit long for me but love everything about it."
5.0,"These pajamas look good, fit as expected, and wash well."
5.0,The size I got fit me like I thought it would. My bust size is around a 40 so I got a XL and that bust size was a 44. I went with the size chart that the seller offered. This is not a cheaply made material. The zipper part is so cool. If you get chilly you can zip it up.
5.0,It looked and fit better than I expected. I'm happy about my purchase.
5.0,My son just lived it!
5.0,Way better then what I thought it would be
5.0,I got this for myself. I like the design it‚Äôs really unique also it‚Äôs very comfortable.
5.0,Happy with workmanship as they are very soft inside and keep child‚Äôs hands warm and provide hours of playtime in the snow.  Adjustable strap on the wrist for well form fitting. Zipper compartment is very small and maybe useful for a few folded up bills or key. Not real room for anything else. Inside glove grip helps with handling items. For the price and what you get I am satisfied and would recommend.
5.0,I got this to wear to red hat get togethers and love it. Looks way better in real life and is super soft and draps well
5.0,"This dress was even more amazing than I thought. The material is nice and smooth, the colors and pattern was just right. I love it and will get in another color"
5.0,Good and tight
5.0,The dress is very lovely good product
5.0,"These are my first pair of sunglasses. I've always worn regular glasses to see, so I've never been able to wear sunglasses. I finally got contacts so I get to wear these now. I fell in love with them! I love the mirror lenses they have. They are good quality frames. They do not feel like some cheap frames you get at a regular store. I bought my bf a pair of Ray Bans, and these frames have the same feel when I try them both on. Awesome especially for the price. The size of the frame is average, so it isn't too big or too small. Plus the hinges are flexible, so you can fix them to your fitting as well. They are good for any size face.<br /><br />They also come with a bag to carry the glasses, and they are soft on the lenses to make sure they don't get scratched.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I buy products based on reviews, so I guarantee you this review is completely honest based on my experience."
5.0,This was a great purchase that was inexpensive. will purchase again to decorate a plain pedestal sink and add hidden storage
5.0,love this dress. true to size chart.
5.0,I love both of them! They fit perfect and look amazing! Every time i wear them i get compliments
5.0,"I have not had much success with shoe inserts or orthotics in the past.  I just thought I would try this product to see if it would help with the pain of over pronation of my left foot.  I was totally surprised by the level of comfort it gave me from day one.  Easy to insert, stays in place.  I've actually had many days of pain free walking in the last two weeks of wearing this product.  I have ordered another pain for my other shoes."
5.0,Great length and can wear for casual or dressy occasions!
5.0,A great raincoat for rough rainy weather. Keeps you from getting cold & makes sure the water doesn't get on from the elements in style.
5.0,This is a gift for my son for his birthday. This is right up his alley for his style and he will love it
5.0,Nice ring well made heavy duty ring

5.0,It's perfect.
5.0,We just put together our outdoor umbrella and it wasn't had to do and it's easy to<br />operate too.  Already enjoying it!
5.0,"In March I bought Luggage Organizer Cubes and Pouches and I was hoping this Duffel Bag would be large enough to accommodate them. Well it turned out that they fit perfectly and I am so happy. It was always hard to get something out of a duffel without messing everything up but not if you can just pull out a pouch and all the rest are in pouches also. This duffel is made of tough nylon material with strong nylon strap handles that are adjustable to carry it in hand or on the shoulder. It folds completely to fit in the color pouch on the front, mine is the rose pink color. After you open the duffel you can use the pouch on the front for anything you want to carry along as a cell phone, makeup, credit cards, money, etc. This bag will also be great for use when flying to put on the floor or overhead since it is a perfect size. I am very happy with this duffel bag.<br />I did receive a discount on this duffel in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, which is what I just gave."
5.0,"Perfect, good quality, really fast service even with engraving."
5.0,"I love how it fits and feels! I am a big girl with a big bust! It hugs my curves and just feels sexy. It is a little short on the back, so if your blessed backed there be careful! And I love the pockets!!"
5.0,"Great patch for the price, well made and same quality as other patches I have purchased in the past. I wouldn't hesitate to order again."
5.0,Good quality. Perfect sizing. Two thumbs up.
5.0,"Nice watch for the price, husband is a construction worker so sometimes a watch does not last long. Would buy again."
5.0,"Shoes are warm and toasty, seem to be very weather resistant.  Wore them to shovel the walk and several trips to the ski hill work great.  Are super easy to get on and off.  Great winter shoes"
5.0,This is a great pair of sunglasses.
5.0,"Fantastic touring boot, comfortable  for long periods!"
5.0,My daughter loves them. And they make no noise so me too!!!
5.0,"Let me start by saying these are gorgeous! Green is my favorite color and these are perfect. The color is vibrant, the silver setting really helps bring out the color. They are not at all heavy which I was a little worried about, instead they sit  on my ear great workout sagging. They are big enough to make a statement without being cheap looking. They are a nice length so you can see them when I have my hair down. Overall they are really beautiful and well worth the price. I got these for a discount for an honest review."
5.0,"Bought this for work as a summer appropriate dress. The material is thick and feels high quality, the length is also great for a casual/professional setting, also love love the pockets!"
5.0,This is an excellent watch for the price. I am very happy with it. It loses about one second a day. I got it because it has an alarm function. I would recommend it to you.
5.0,Great product and style
5.0,Loved these! So cute! Just them for a corporate event and they were a hit
5.0,Just what I was looking for. Good support but comfortable as well.
5.0,Good quality. For as expected.
5.0,"daughter loves it, great for school and flight carry on"
5.0,The pajamas are very comfortable!
5.0,"I originally bought this t-shirt for my husband to wear during his work outs. His first comment when we received this shirt was &#34;This is too nice to wear for working out in.&#34; When thats the only complaint, you know you're buying a good quality t-shirt. He has worn this shirt a few times to the gym, he loves it. It doesn't ride up on him or bunch up in the shoulders while he is lifting weights. The fit is perfect, true to size. I would suggest checking the company sizing and not amazons just to be sure you are getting the correct fit. The shirt is super soft and made of strong feeling material. The color we got was sapphire, and its a very nice royal blue style color. My husband wants a few more of these shirts in different colors now. They are and excellent buy for someone looking for a plain but great quality t-shirt. We both highly recommend it.<br /><br />Disclosure:  If you find this review helpful please let me know.  I am a reviewer and receive no benefits for doing this other than a discounted product.

5.0,"I bought the coat as a Christmas present for my daughter and she absolutely fell in love with it! Perfect fit, perfect length and all the other ‚Äúextras‚Äù were added bonuses. Would definitely recommend this product!"
5.0,My 2.5yo som loves this neck gaitor. He's a big fan of Marvel & loves Hulk so he was super excited when he saw this. The fit is perfect & sits well on his face. Not too tight & doesn't fall off. I have hand washed it a couple of times & let it air dry & it keeps it shape. Definitely a good buy!
5.0,Nothing I diliked
5.0,Was a great gift Good quality and fast shipping
5.0,"I went into the Made for You process very skeptical.  I was very, very, very surprised at how comfortable the shirt is...and how well it fits. I'm pretty broad across the shoulders, so a lot of t-shirts fit me kind of funky in that area, but this shirt looks...well...like it was made just for me. It's not too snug, the sleeves are a great length, and the chest and torso are relaxed without appearing baggy. The quality of the material is top notch too, very soft but durable feeling. I'll be ordering up a couple more in different colors!"
5.0,Bought these for my dad who is in rehab for a broken hip. These are comfy for him with his PT and easier to put on during OT. May get a few more pairs for him!
5.0,Love love love. Looks very expensive! Fits my large head.
5.0,These bags are Awesome! Perfect size and I'm already looking to buy more. I work at a hotel so we gave them to the housekeepers to store their clean & dirty rags. Great product with a great price!
5.0,This shirt is very cute but does run small. I usually wear a large but ordered a size up and  the XL still makes this a fitting shirt.
5.0,"My husband has a BIG ASS HEAD, his words not mine, and this hat fits-really fits and does not look like an adult in a childs hat. Happy to find a hat that does not cost a small fortune and fits."
5.0,LOVE this dress!  Perfect to dress up or down!  Will purchase more in different colors!
5.0,Love this and it is very attractive on. Warm and comfortable.  The size fit well and colors is great and true to the listing.
5.0,"I love tiny chokers. This is adorable and petite and can be worn with anything. Also, I love the fact that part of the purchase is donated to help others in need. The water project is a great project. I hope to see more items coming out and companies doing the same thing."
5.0,This is a very cute and high quality set. Washes well and makes my daughter feel like a real chef.
5.0,Carries all the essentials and keeps them within easy reach. Fits nicely in gym bag with spilling and avoids messes.

5.0,We love it. We will be revisiting the store to get more.
5.0,I bought it to have it altered to fit my body. I love this little dress! ‚ô•

5.0,"This band is better than I thought it would be.  I am satisfied with this band,  it looks great on the watch and my wrist. Great value. I will buy another color."
5.0,"The color is brighter than I had anticipated, but otherwise I'm 100% satisfied.  Fits perfectly and looks good.  If the ring deteriorates in quality over time I'll update my review, but it appears that it will be able to hold up to a beating."
5.0,"Ordered 50, got 50.. all working. We are going to use them with para-cord for boy scout projects, and just plain fun crafting."

5.0,"I am loving this hat! It's super comfy, warm and it looks great! I have had trouble finding a hat I liked that looked good until now!!"
5.0,"Received my sunglasses couple days ago, they're impressed me. Awesome design. They include a bamboo holder, carry sleeve bag, microfiber cleaning cloth. They made of wood, texture are very smooth, not a single burr. Really lightweight, you can even forget you‚Äôre wearing them, they're most comfortable sunglasses!<br />Lenses shiny blue color, are polarized (lenses made of plastic).<br />They fit great, and look great too!"

5.0,"An absolute amazing wallet. Quality feels great, magnet is strong, and doesn't feel bulky in my pocket."
5.0,"If you want a prayer cross, buy it from this vendor, not the one on TV!  Much more straightforward deal than the hassle I've been through with them."
5.0,"I love them, thank you."
5.0,"It is a beautiful watch in both design and color, and it keeps time closer than 5 seconds a day.  I am delighted with it!"

5.0,Like the white sweat shirt for weekend ware and it is soft and very warm...

5.0,"Love it, fits great and very pretty."
5.0,Less is more!
5.0,did not fit was way to small
5.0,"These are really nice glasses, especially for the price.  Super lightweight but solid construction.  They arrived well packaged, each with protective clings on the lenses, inside plastic slipcovers AND in their own case.  One pair was missing the protective lens clings and had a small scratch on one of the lenses.  I emailed the seller and had a response within an hour...they are sending out a replacement pair.  Super happy with their service and the glasses.  Would definitely buy these again.  I'd bought another set months ago, from a different seller, and they were too large...constantly slipping off my head.  Not these!  These are perfect!"
5.0,Really nice and comfy band
5.0,These gloves were a bit big but I have small hands. The inside is very soft and you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre touching the dishes. I also like the extra length that protects you from splashes. Cute colors.
5.0,These frames are quite nice.  Sturdy.  Iwould order again
5.0,"I am always losing glasses and I just need them for reading so these were perfect for shopping, dining out and playing on my iPad and not having to take reading glasses on and off all the time. They fit my face perfect."
5.0,"I searched and searched for charms that look like my babies and these charms are SPOT on (for Poodle teddy bear/puppy cut). I hate that Poodle charms are always long ears, top knot, typical poodle look... Not all Poodles look like that lol. So Thank you! I love them. I got small size. Fits perfect with my other charms."
5.0,"This bag seems to be well-made; to be honest I haven't actually used it yet, but I plan to charge my crystals in the river ( or other running water ) with it!üòÅ"
5.0,Was a nice fit
5.0,"I love this so much! It doesn't fall off very easily which is a big bonus. I don't wear It often though. It kinda squeezes my head when worn for more than a few minutes, but that could be that I'm not used to it."
5.0,"Not only that the dress is cute, it looks exactly like in the pictures as well. As long as you check the measurements described, the fit will be comfortable. I love that you can make a nice bow in front from the string ties."
5.0,Okay at first what I ordered the dress there was a small problem with the word didn't get sewn in the back around the neck and I sent pictures to the seller and I have to admit these are some very friendly people they kept in contact with me and made sure I was happy with my purchase and replaced my dress and I love it . You can wear it around the house for lounging you can dress it up it's good for just about any occasion and it's very comfortable .

5.0,"I love these glasses. Great price, great fit, great quality."
5.0,WOW!  I love my apple watch and this watch band makes it look great.
5.0,"Very simple, slim.  I have been looking for a slim wallet like this for ages.  Some of the middle cards are a little messy to pull out and put back; however, I or anybody usually use 1 card and an ID most of the time.  It is overall 5 stars."
5.0,"I ordered 2xl and have a 46"" chest and it fit really loose around the waist which I wanted that's why I went up a size. Shirts are very comfortable"
5.0,These are very cute necklaces for my daughter and her 2 best friends. They all love them!
5.0,I bought this Watch for my boyfriend for Christmas Because he was worried he was going to break the $300 watch I bought for his birthday at work.

5.0,"I was skeptical to purchase these at first, but once I actually used them on vacation, they're amazing. Everything is in compartments and it eliminates the need to poke around your luggage for your stuff.

5.0,I used a different top but it's still a cool outfit
5.0,"These work great.  Had a few extra pair of ""eyes"" that needed a case to keep them from being scratched.  These are perfect and as good as any you my get with a pair of protective glasses."
5.0,"This rash guard is top quality,  super cute, and arrived quickly too. The material is thicker than rashguards I bought from other vendors, which is nice.

It folds up tiny, so I'm thinking about getting another to put it in the glove compartment for sun emergencies. I've been wearing this hat all summer and it still looks new."
5.0,"This dress was a surprise when it arrived. I was skeptic because if the price, but I loved it! Other vendors offered this dress for $20 and even $40!"
5.0,They fit very much
5.0,Fit as expected. Mertens run a bit big so if you are 11.5 or 12 then  you can use 11 us Martens. The Deverell is nice but it look more robust in person that what it look like on the Picture..
5.0,Amazing fit and comfortable
5.0,These pajamas are soft and adorable! I did order a size larger because we are in a big growing phase - and he loves them. Perfect for any Dr. Seuss fan to wear to school on pajama day! Washed really well and after several washes- they still look and feel brand new. Amazing fabric!
5.0,"I am so glad I got these!  The waist band is comfortable, the fabric is soft, and the length works for me.  I love the lace detail.  It is a nice detail wearing a longer tunic or short dress over the pants.  I'd love to see a wider range of colors for these too."
5.0,Great watch. A Skagen knock-off at about 1/4th the price.
5.0,"Nice quality, material is soft and seems water resistant. Love the design also and the image was clear with nice colors. Comfortable on also."

5.0,"Size small in men‚Äôs will work for teen boys. My son ordered this size small sweatshirt and he usually wears 14/16 in boys. Great fit, great material."
5.0,It is well detailed and sturdy. The position it faces once hanging can be adjusted to make it face the way you want it as I did for my rearview mirror
5.0,I have a great pair of readers everywhere that I need them after buying this 3 pack.
5.0,"love this dress. literally want it in every color. so soft, so comfortable, the pockets are amazing. I am short, 5'2 so the dress is a little long to wear with flat sandals but easy to hold up if needed. I got it in burgundy and black. everytime I wear it I get complimented."
5.0,"This case is exactly what I needed! Slipping any pair of my eyeglasses or sunglasses into this case leaves me with peace of mind. This case is sturdy and you can connect it to your gear of any kind many different ways!  I am using this to hold and protect my sunglasses on my motorcycle backpack, on my waist when inline skating or mountain biking. This replaces the eyeglass case for my daily wear too. This is very well-made case and a great addition to my gear."
5.0,Love this look. I normally like a simple look. But once in a while I want my engagement ring to look bigger. True to size. Just hope color stays. Pictures don't do it justice.

5.0,Shirt is really nice
5.0,My son likes them a lot. They don‚Äôt have labels or anything that would bothered him while wearing them. He is 5.7 and 115lbs and bought small and extra small and both fits him nicely.

5.0,"excellent, sturdy, easy to store, holds lots of food.  i keep them on the back of my neck rest in car so I always have them when going to shop..<br />would buy again, in fact looking for the same insulated!  Being partially disabled, they are so easy to carry and hold on arm, if need be...."
5.0,Very well put together!
5.0,Cute.  Well made.  As described.<br />Good price.  I love it !  Beautiful !  I love it !
5.0,"This nightgown is very flattering and comfortable. It is shorter than I realized, however I have a big booty and that may be why it‚Äôs barely covered."
5.0,It looks like the picture. It is easy to read and I love how it fits my wrist. Worth the money.
5.0,"I actually got the short sleeve.I wear a 16 size and bought the XXL. My bust is more than what the sizing prints by 4 &#34;. And still fit . I am short so length was okay. But if you are tall it will run very short. So use next size or to up, By short I mean a little above 5 foot in height.Its comfortable knit."
5.0,Cute shoes for a little girl I was shopping for.

5.0,[[VIDEOID:ae24391110ef3f9c663f55723d66ab]] They have a good height and zip up the side so they are nice and snug around my leg. I wore them around Vegas and my feet hardly hurt after hours. I got lots of compliments on them
5.0,"You pay for what you get, but they worked well for a costume."

5.0,"After chemo, this was a life saver."
5.0,Nice very nice and cute
5.0,"This was a gift to my son who loves Cameo cookies.  We cannot get them locally, so Amazon is the way to go. üòâ. The individually wrapped packages makes it easy for him to take to work, or wherever he goes.  I highly recommend this product.  I give it five stars!!!!"
5.0,it is a unique color
5.0,"This dress is excellent quality, was exactly as I was expecting. I would say these do run on the small side, I am in between a 12 and 14, so I bought the 14 and it was still a little snug for my liking."
5.0,Love wearing these!!!<br />SOOO FUN!<br />And COOL üòé
5.0,I liked the colors and patterns
5.0,Looks good on.  Multiple compliments.  What I used for eye protection while at work from COVID 19.
5.0,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü§©ü§©ü§©
5.0,"I bought this for my son's first pair of glasses. I was looking for something flexible and strong enough for an active 5 year old boy. The frame is very cute, my son liked them which is a plus because that means he wants to wear them. The frame can bend and it goes back to the original position. It is a good deal for the money!"
5.0,It came in a vacuum sealed bag it was cute and perfect fit
5.0,"One of my favorite dresses I have in my wardrobe. It is a snug fit and hugs your body in a good way--definitely shows off your curves. If you're worried about visible bra straps showing or panty lines showing through the dress, I recommend to opt for a tight strapless or backless bra, and thong or &#34;cheeky&#34; style of underwear. I purchased the dark blue/navy colored dress and paired it with my favorite nude pumps. It was a super cute color combination. For accessories I used nude-pink and gold jewelry and it all went well together. Definitely a great buy!"
5.0,I loved this 2 piece. The material is mesh but stretchy. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô6 I ordered a size Medium and it‚Äôs fits perfect. My boobs are on the bigger side so this outfit had them very secure and the drawstrings on the skirt helped me adjust how long or short I wanted my skirt. Will most def shop again (:
5.0,"Amazing, love the material."
5.0,"Id√©ntico a la foto, es como de playa. A mi esposa le encanto."
5.0,"For the price it's a Fits good...i was hoping the shirt was made of thicker cotton, but it is about the same as fruit of the loom or hanes.  Also it does have a tag it is not tagless."
5.0,"I needed  watch that was cute and affordable, being a teacher I am a little tough on watches. I loved this so much I even bought another color."
5.0,fit 4 year old gloves were big though
5.0,My sister loved it!!
5.0,Just opened the pack this morning so I could rate and I have to say that I am now in love with onesies.
5.0,It was for a little black dress mask party
5.0,This an is perfect for sailor moon fans!!! The toe box was just right and the arch support was spacious. My phone and cards can fit perfectly without interruption of poor design or poorly developed craftmanship. It's perfect! I'd give it a 10 if I could!üíù
5.0,Quality and appearance of wallet are above my expectations. I have received several compliments .
5.0,Great wetsuit! I ordered a 3t for my 2.5 year old so it‚Äôs a little big on him but it will definitely fit him through theming AZ  summer.
5.0,"Simple cute design,, my wife loved it. Makes a great gift... One of a kind handmade piece.. Good price for a unique piece"
5.0,"Since my cataract surgery I no longer need progressive lens eyeglasses, only readers.  It was a nuisance when doing some things that need readers for the instructions, for example, and then not for the assembly.  This is a perfect solution.  The cords are well made and slip onto my readers very easily.  There is enough length for a comfortable fit most everyone.  The colors add a cool factor so I do not look like a librarian, no offense intended.  Can't beat the price."
5.0,"Its a free fit you sow and size it. It is a size ten, but if your a sower it will not matter to much. I am a 1-2 in size but i was scraping and using parts on other fabric i had. Otherwise i could say the 10 to 1-2 would be a tad difficult to work with. Overall this is a great look and feel, and i cant wait to make my new outfit from it."
5.0,Swarovski Is always beautiful and this bracelet did not disappoint. It‚Äôs a wonderful gift for anyone including yourself
5.0,Material is of high quality. I returned only because it was shorter for me. I wish they had longer ones. I will keep looking for similar design.
5.0,"Cute, stylish, love!!! I don‚Äôt know what else to say but buy it. Might as well?"
5.0,"Many Najas are... well... HUGE. We've retired to the Southwest where Najas and Squash Blossom pieces are big and bold. Not every woman want to wear big, bold jewelry. Some of us prefer and understated, more simple look. The stones in this Naja are wonderful. The craftsmanship is excellent. What I love most, though, is the size, which isn't overpowering. It's not dainty, but just right (for me). I've been buying American West jewelry for almost 20 years and it rarely disappoints."
5.0,"These are great tie clips for skinner ties!  Pretty strong material so it takes a little finesse to get the material from your tie and shirt together in between the clip itself, but after the first few times it'll expand enough that it's easy to slide on."
5.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and these are long enough and look great
5.0,Love the color and fit. Also is thick and warm!
5.0,gorgeous!!!!!!!!
5.0,Very pretty! flattering!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d14c8fed8474419207102114c65852ca]] I love this set! Material is thick and breathable. I‚Äôm 186 5‚Äô2 and ordered a large. Pants have pockets. If you order in a tight size like I did then you will need to adjust pants every time you run, squats or do anything else. Definitely worth the price and order another one."
5.0,"I am an older woman,  and I am impressed with this piece, both playful and apt for an evening out against a black dress.  Long enough to double up and still falls nicely around the neck.  I love the Chuvora pieces, so affordable for a unique piece of jewelry.  Beautifully designed and executed.<br /><br />ooh, BTW, the amount of compliments that I have got on this piece and now many piece of Chovura is amazing."
5.0,Very good quality for price
5.0,My friend loves cats and she loves this bag.
5.0,"Pretty happy with it .  It‚Äôs kinda like that cheap material they print images on and it‚Äôs thin , but I don‚Äôt mind it .  The image looks good and it isn‚Äôt blurry"
5.0,Fits perfect and I love it
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter (13) and she loves it. Fits her phone, wallet, and a couple small things. She gets compliments all the time. It makes you smile."
5.0,"Arrived way too late, but it was worth it, my wife loves it! Quality material, soft and super comfortable. Giving this a 5 star was easy."
5.0,Love it all
5.0,"I absolutely love them. They arrived on time, and they are perfect! They are very comfortable, they look exactly like the picture. I normally wear a size 9, but i ordered a 10 just for the simple fact that my calfs are wide and it was definitely a good choice because they fit just perfect around my leg, and are a little big in the foot which is fine so I can wear fuzzy socks."
5.0,My daughter Isabella loved them.
5.0,it's for my 10 year old grandson who was lugging everything in a heavy back pack.  He loves it and I love it because his spine will stay healthy.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:e1f37e6fe26a394281baaad2bd6db2e7]] The little button was hard to find at first, but I finally found it on the left side of the wings. Beautiful effect. Glad I bought these! Can't wait to wear them for Halloween ‚ú®"
5.0,"My wedding band and engagement ring are platinum.  This cloth works great to remove the patina that builds up on my rings over time.  The cloth is quite large which is great and you can see the patina rub off on the cloth and watch it go to work.  The treated inner cloth loosens the patina (or tarnish for silver), and the outer blue cloth buffs the metal to a brilliant shine. I buff it twice a week while I watch TV and it keeps my ring looking brand new!  Over time a new cloth will need to be purchased once the chemical on the white cloth wears away.  But at $5 a cloth, it's worth it to not have to pay and worry about sending the ring out. :)"
5.0,"Love these, soooooo comfortable!"
5.0,My granddaughter loved the soft shirt. She is 4 and said I am going to wear this and my friends at daycare will love it. üòç
5.0,"Love this shirt, it‚Äôs a great fit and true to size."
5.0,"Working on my feet all day, my feet got tired and sore. A coworker recommended compression socks. First pair of compression socks I ever bought. Fantastic results. Ordered three more pairs two days later."
5.0,Super cute and fits the baby well. Detachable cape is great.
5.0,My 6 year old loves them!! They are super cute! They fit true to size. The charms are adorable!! Will definitely need to buy more colors
5.0,"I love this coat.  I needed to buy a jacket to wear after my rotator cuff surgery.  I knew my arm would be in a sling for weeks so I bought this because of the arm slits according to the picture.  Also, I love animal print styles.<br /><br />I must say I can't say enough of this jacket.  It's was comfortable while I had my arm in a sling and after my full recuperation I am wearing this jacket over a turtleneck sweater and I am still styling!<br /><br />I consistently (still) get compliments on this jacket.  I highly recommend!  It's stylish, and fits great!"
5.0,"I wore these shorts to swim in at Physical Therapy, as I am tall (5'8""), fat (over 300#) with large stomach and butt -- without curvy boobs, and need something that will MOVE with me. Traditional swim shorts from the popular women's catalogue were OK, but felt like I was wearing 2 pairs of bike shorts and the outer pair sagged. Another swim suit bottom was sheer and rolled down at the stomach. This pair held me in everywhere. I got lots of compliments on the color, and I was able to work out in the pool -- the fit was really great!!"
5.0,Is just what you expect from a corset is cheap but it works like a high class brand
5.0,Great for skating
5.0,I gave this brooch to y mother and she loved it. I think it's pretty.

5.0,"High quality, rounds out my watch repair tool set"
5.0,Awesome. Simply awesome
5.0,"This dress is just soooo perrrrfect! 120lbs and size small is just great! Wore it once n receives several compliments. I've already purchased other dresses from this seller n will continue to as the quality is just great! Worth every penny I've spent. And, speaking of penny, this dress is very reasonable for the quality I've received. Keep up the great work muisol!"
5.0,I chose a large. I like my clothes roomy<br /> 5' 2 and a 1/2 ---140 lbs<br /><br />It's a richer shade of red than shown in ad. My photo effect makes it look a bit brighter than it is.
5.0,"Great mask for kiddos! It had a great seal on my daughter‚Äôs face. It‚Äôs thick enough where I feel like she is protected, but can also breath easily."
5.0,"This is my 2nd pair of feetures dress sock, love wearing them with my Birkenstocks!"
5.0,I work in cold temperature rooms at my job. And with the wearing of face masks. My glasses always were fogging up. With this product it stopped my hassle of foggy  glasses. Product is easy to use and works great.
5.0,Love it. Very polished look. Like the matching black buttons.
5.0,Love all the Bella Taylor bags.
5.0,"Great graphics, so funny.  Like the fit under arms, no bra showing.  Neckline is high but I like it.  Washes well."
5.0,I get so many compliments when I wear this! It is super fun for dancing as it spins out really big.
5.0,Met my expectations 100%
5.0,"Saturday, fits well, looks good."
5.0,Very cute love the shorts the top is a little small though if your someone with a bigger chest
5.0,exactly what I was looking for.  Seem too e decent quality for the price.  Size was as expected
5.0,"I really love how the material is so good for the jogger pant. It's a perfect fit, I usually wear XL and I ordered XL, and it's just a perfect fit for me. Love the color and the material."
5.0,"I loved the color and fit of the hat however I was hoping the brim would be wider than it actually is. The summer sun in the south is brutal and I purchased it to keep the sun off of my face. It does this well around the noon hour but not so much later in the. At any rate it is well made and very cute, it just didn't work for my intended purpose."
5.0,Great product at a great price.  Actually is a little softer and more flexible that the original one that came with the watch.  Also like this true black vs the dark grey that came with the watch too.  Shipped and delivered in a reasonable time.
5.0,"Very long, great color. My kid won crazy sock day with these, but every day is crazy sock day for him. These are his favorites."
5.0,I bought the magazine for the team analysis and predictions for 2019.  They were all there!

5.0,My cats love these things!!!
5.0,"I‚Äôve worn these two nights now, so haven‚Äôt had them long enough to see exactly what they will do for me, but they seem pretty good. Unlike one reviewer, I have no problems with the quality or size either. I have big feet for a woman (size 9) and very fat ankles, and these fit quite well. Just ordered another package."

5.0,Made well fits great and is just like described in product description.

5.0,I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised with this dress! I bought it to be able to breastfeed while wearing and it appears there won‚Äôt be a problem with that. The fabric is nice and light but not see through at all which I‚Äôm happy about. I was anticipating needing a slip but don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need one. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 9‚Äù and it hits me a bit below the calf. I‚Äôm at 165 postpartum and the large gives me enough room but is still very flattering.
5.0,me encantan
5.0,"These are great shoe ties for me, I don't have real good use of my right hand and no deep sensory feeling ."
5.0,Great hat! Wear this to the pool all the time. Great visor as far as sun protection and not too ‚Äútrucker‚Äù looking. Great vintage look.
5.0,my wife loves it and it's great looking.
5.0,"I wore this witches costume to a Halloween party and it looked good. Fun, colorful and good quality."
5.0,This dress is better than I even expected! It's gorgeous in person. Lovely color. The material is light and comfy. I'm super short (5'0) and the skirt falls just under my knees. I bought a small and it's a perfect fit. I normally wear about a size 2 if that helps anyone decide on a size. The material is a little stretchy so it has some give to it. Definitely a great buy!
5.0,My boys loved it and started wearing it as soon as the opened the box and connected to the bluetooth.
5.0,This for me is a perfect size and fit.  Wearing it cross-shoulder when out and about shopping<br /> is comfortable and affords a good measure of safety as well.
5.0,It's beautiful and flows really nice.
5.0,"Wonderful silk bras.  And yes, they fit!  I've found it difficult to find solid silk bras, esp. with no padding.  I'm grateful to have these."

5.0,"Great Colors, Great Fit, Arrived Quickly.  Reasonable shipping cost.  LIKE"
5.0,"A female Working in a male dominated uniformed job, it‚Äôs only so much I can do to feminize myself. This has added what I wanted without altering my uniform so much. It has proven to be durable at the same time. And didn‚Äôt have to spend a fortune to do so. I‚Äôm well with this purchase"
5.0,"Good quality, good price"
5.0,The fabric is very soft and breathable. My son had no problems wearing this.
5.0,"I planned to wear my sister's pearls for my beach wedding but when she brought them over I realized they weren't the right length for my dress. I ordered this necklace and held my breath.<br />I couldn't be more pleased. It's delicate, naturally beautiful and the ideal accessory for any ball, wedding or upscale event. Classy not ornate. I received so many compliments at my wedding and no one would ever suspect I paid less than a Benjamin for this beauty."
5.0,Perfect cool looking glasses for the beach! Just what I wanted!
5.0,These are beautiful and light weight.
5.0,I ordered a size 10 and normally wear a size 10 in dress shoes. I was nervous that they would run small after reading reviews. These fit perfectly and were comfortable to wear at two weddings.
5.0,I love this bra it's a little loose around so I should have ordered a size down the cup size is perfect. It's a comfortable bra to work in. I will be ordering more just a 38 instead of a 40
5.0,It‚Äôs pretty  and exactly what a I wanted
5.0,I love it and so does my daughter she wants one now! Jewelry is beautiful!
5.0,"This is a beautiful well made jacket , Be careful when ordering to get the size correct .I normally wear a extra large  , but  I ordered a XXL that was perfect . so order up in size . This well worth the money ."
5.0,I bought this for my 9 year old nephew. He was so excited and was showing it off to anyone that would listen. Even my 21 year old brother is jealous!
5.0,Great for spring or summer. I'm 5'5'' and 190 pounds and the XL fit perfect. Even a little loose so its very comfortable. Length is just above my knees and only top is slightly see through. Just have to wear a tank top underneath.
5.0,Great product bought for our son who runs cross country his glasses were always falling off tell we got this and it ended that problem
5.0,Better than I thought.  Order them they are great!  Look like real army tags just smaller.
5.0,I LOVE the colors and design on this shirt. By far my NEW favorite festival shirt :D
5.0,Quite comfortable and fit as expected.
5.0,"I ordered size small. I received bottom in size small and top in size medium. Thank goodness for that because the top is really tiny. I probably would look more modest in size large (just the  top) .  I have rather large breasts and narrow hips so  the bottom (size small) fits me very well but the top does not give me much coverage. I think that I look really good in this bathing suit.  It's very pretty and sexy. I'm not sure if I will have a courage to wear it in public but I'm keeping it, definitely.  My measurements : 36, 28, 36.  I think that bottom  in size medium would fit me well too. The ties give  you  flexibility.  Overall I love this suit."
5.0,Love it for my baby boys Disney trip!
5.0,Confortable on the golf course.
5.0,Absolutely love this dress! I usually wear a size small but I ordered a size medium and it fit perfectly. It's a stunning dress and I received many complaints on it last night.
5.0,Muy bonita me encanta.
5.0,Great for having long nails. Having long nails it‚Äôs hard to get your card out of the machine. Well this is tool to use and so cute.
5.0,These earrings are BEAUTIFUL!  And the Sterling silver posts cause no problem for my sensitive ears.  I look forward to enjoying them for many years.  Thank you for providing me with exactly what I hoped for!

5.0,these pants are surprisingly cute
5.0,Larger than expected. Good weight. Impressive.

5.0,"I love the materials for this headwrap. It does not slip off my hair, and keeps all my curls in the same place."
5.0,These shirts are awesome . It‚Äôs perfect for me . Neleus makes good quality workout gear. I‚Äôm satisfied with every purchase with them .
5.0,I love it! It was just what I was looking for! I have worn it multiple times already and I have zero complaints!
5.0,Love it but wish it came in a small--it's too loose in the shoulders.
5.0,So cute! True to color and size. I'm 5 ft 92 lbs and the small fits great. A little loose in the chest area but not a major problem.
5.0,True to child size.<br />My 4yr old petite fits into them losely but I'm fine with it.  She had them on for at least a good 2 hours. She was excited to have child size gloves for her
5.0,These immediately became my favorite pair of shoes I've ever owned. They are as light and comfortable as a sock.  The synthetic material on the toe end of the shoe is high quality and doesn't scuff. The mesh material on the back gets dirty easily but is easy to clean. I'm buying an extra pair to keep unopened for when my current pair finally wears out.
5.0,Petite ~ perfect for my Iphone
5.0,It looks super pretty. It shipped pretty fast too. It fits just fine. I am happy with it so far!

5.0,It very.<br />Fine work well
5.0,Loved the earrings.  Perfect color
5.0,"I love this band. Easy to put on and adjust. A couple of my friends liked it so well that they also ordered one. Plus usually metal turns green on me and this hasn‚Äôt,and I‚Äôve now had it for over 2 months"
5.0,This ring is great! It came in it‚Äôs own box so it will be the perfect presentation for a stocking stuffer. I bought one for me and my daughter.
5.0,a tad bit hard to open clasp but guessing thats best to keep it secure
5.0,"Very nice item, fit very well and washed well."
5.0,"I do love the light weightiness and the variety of colors.<br />Need to place under hair, if windy!"
5.0,Perfect size for use to use under the sink in our RV
5.0,Great basic bracelet. Nice metal and quality clasp. I have worn with many styles and find this to be a very versatile piece of jewelry.
5.0,"These gloves were a birthday gift for my daughter. At first she thought they were going to be too small because the wrist area was somewhat snug, but once they were on, they were extremely comfortable and attractive on her hands. Very nice soft leather. she liked the warm lining."
5.0,This outfit was very cute and comfortable. Husband loved it.
5.0,These were perfect for holding my daughters glasses for her 100th day of school. Very cute and solidly made. Loved them!
5.0,Muy suave
5.0,I can carry this with my phone and credit cards and not<br /> have a heavy purse dragging me down.  It's excellent quality.
5.0,great fit for shorter hairstyles
5.0,Happy wife!
5.0,Er
5.0,"Great quality, perfect fit, looks terrific"
5.0,"Perfect size, easy to get in and out.  I use them for my lip piercing."
5.0,Great fit and look nice
5.0,"Comfortable to wear, easy clean, fits true to size"
5.0,The quality was more than expected and the size was exact. I will definitely shop for your specific brand again.
5.0,My wife loves this!
5.0,This band gives a more dressy look for my watch.
5.0,"These are a great set of tank tops. While I suspect most men purchase such tops for working out, I have been wearing them as undershirts for several years now. These fit as expected and I like the feel on my skin. They look nice as well."
5.0,These were very cute and fit my daughter perfectly.
5.0,Good looking hat. I wore for a Havannah  nights party and now i continue wear it occasionally!
5.0,Beautiful dress. Got many compliments. Fits above knee but can wear to office.
5.0,fit great and comfortable
5.0,order 2 sizes up if you are curvy. After reading the reviews i ordered a 3x. I am 5'7 240lb and i am curvy. i normally wear a solid 16. i ordered a 3x because everyone said go up a size or two and i agree. It was a little big at the top but it fit my bottom perfectly. the extra space at the top allowed me to breath and i didnt have to wear and girdle with this outfit. This was my birthday outfit and i loved it. I have red hair so by the end of the night the back of it was red. I sprayed with shout and washed it the next morning and its good as new. if you are bigger in the top it still works good!
5.0,"So far, so good!  These are a nice lightweight and very soft drawstring pouch.  They are perfect for protecting my spare pairs of cheap sunglasses from scratches and dust while in my bag or car console.  They are very thin material and would provide little protection against serious bumps, but perfect for what I needed!"
5.0,Very tight at cuff
5.0,"I love these!! They are not overly big, they don‚Äôt cover my eyebrows all the way, but they do go a little past my face on the cat eye part, which I love. I will be purchasing another pair or 3!"
5.0,"Able to replace my broken hat straps with these!  The included instructions are a little lacking so I watched a quick youtube video for some pointers but as long as my sewing skills hold up, these should do the trick!"
5.0,"Seems well constructed, easy to change the size with the included tools!"
5.0,good item and  good price
5.0,Got these today and they are very cute! Just the right size and seem to be made very well. I will give one pair to my sister and keep one for myself. I am going to order some more to give to one of my friends who also loves to take pictures.
5.0,"Cool wig, looks just like the picture."
5.0,"I absolutely love the earrings, they're Humble and Chic as per the name on the sealed gift-wrapped box they came in, along with a lovely thank you card, something all mindful sellers should do.  As an ex-jewelry designer, I can tell you with certainty if you like statement earrings these earrings are for you. Their lightweight big and bold in a subtle classy way and extremely comfortable on the ear, and here's the best part, they don't hang off the ear like so many others do, the designer knew exactly what to do. The earrings are perfect for a Mother at a son or daughter's wedding, fine dining, or if you're like me and love jewelry wear them every day. I have tons of jewelry with that said, a woman can never have enough jewelry. A solid color dress with only these earrings, no neckless or bracelets are needed, believe me, you will shine, that's what you call a statement piece of jewelry, It's usually meant to be worn alone, of course, rings are the exception to the rule, do not hesitate to buy, they're perfect!"
5.0,Good quality. Gift.
5.0,"Would buy again, great product and good price!"
5.0,Great dress! Beautiful and light weight! Perfect for vacation and going to the beach! Straps are easy to hook up or off as needed. The front is not super scandalous either very tasteful.
5.0,great quality and trendy style! not much different than those high end sunglasses.
5.0,"Beautiful.  The perfect size, and smells like heaven; it is literally a work of art. I like the long strap. Lots of cunning pockets inside and out."
5.0,The size I ordered was too small for me. I will give it to somebody.
5.0,I ordered the 6-12 month size for my 5 month old. The size was good fit and there is room to grow for the winter months until Dec/Jan. The quality is good and it's super cute. The color was more cream than white but it's a nice color.  Loved the pink one!  I am happy with this purchase.
5.0,"My teenage daughter said, Dad, your socks are cool!!! Enough said"
5.0,Dalmatian fan adored it
5.0,Kids love them!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:9674ca2ae1f740963c9fa54515c4a0c9]] Very cute and dainty. Sparkly. Comes with normal backs and soft backs. Definitely recommend!
5.0,Beautiful charm
5.0,Perfect little socks for my baby boy. He's a big 23lbs. 7 month old and these fit a bit large on him but I was hoping they would since he grows so fast. Now he has some socks to run around the house in once he starts walking. Love the colors and fabric. Quality grip on the bottom. Great buy.
5.0,My husband loves his new hat!
5.0,"fantastic, very well made and warm"
5.0,Second belt purchased.  Both appear to be good quality and fits well.  Will order again when needed.
5.0,"Great sweater.  Lightweight, very flattering cut, fits well, soft to the touch, and the colors are really nice.  I love it!"
5.0,Amazing dress. Fits me like a glove. I got so many compliments on this!
5.0,"They are all so beautiful, not chipped and true to colour. Would definitely order again"
5.0,So cute. Really shows off your gauge size. They aren‚Äôt heavy. Uncomfortable to sleep in but obviously you‚Äôd know that‚Äôs a possibility when buying something pointy and metal. Lol
5.0,Got this for my daughter for her 11th birthday. She absolutely loves it. Rose gold is her favorite color. The only issue we had was with the clasp is hard to get the change on and off sometimes.
5.0,My wife and I both use the silicone band rings in lieu of traditional rings due to my area of work and her being alergic to the gold bands. These are also much more comfortable when dealing with children.
5.0,"This is such a sweet dress, perfect for twirling. It has a soft cotton upper, cotton lined half skirt, and flowy rainbow overskirt. It is generously sized I ordered the 110 for my 5 year old and it fits but does drag on the ground. Although I am sure within the next few months the length will be fine. Tempted to order the pastel version as well. I am impressed by the quality, no loose stitches and the fabric is quite nice. Would be great for photos, dress up, Halloween, or just because."
5.0,This is my new favorite card holder.
5.0,My son loved them and the size was perfect.
5.0,"It's soft, warm, durable. Fit is perfect and the color matches the description."
5.0,"Really easy to use, stays put"
5.0,My husband loved them!
5.0,Super comfy and soft inside and fits just right! Life it
5.0,"This is a great set of quarter cut Merino wool socks if you already use Merino or if you want to give Merino a try.  My previous socks were crew cut, so I had to fold them down from the top while wearing gaiters to keep the tops from getting caked with dirt/mud.  As you can see from the pictures, these socks will fit underneath a gaiter if you choose to go that route.<br /><br />For sizing, my shoe size is 13 wide and I went with the size 13-15 for the socks.  They fit fine without any bunching and of course, are not too tight.  I used one pair on two different 4 mile hikes without any issues.  The socks do not have any bulky seams which may cause hot spots.  I machine washed the pair after each walk and although I have not put a lot of miles on them, there is no evidence of pilling or wear.  The socks are definitely more comfortable after being laundered.<br /><br />If you just want wool socks for comfortable warmth, these certainly fit the bill and kept my feet toasty warm or a rainy, 40 degree day."
5.0,"Perfect for the SAT!!! Helped keep track on timing to perfection! Easy to silence, made absolutely no noise!"
5.0,"I have a whole collection of molecule necklaces, and I reserve my caffeine molecule for days when I got bad sleep or have a stressful work day ahead of me. Though I jokingly say it's so the caffeine necklace can &#34;give me strength,&#34; in actuality it's more useful as a warning to my coworkers, haha. If they see me wearing it, they know to leave me alone until I've had a few cups of coffee, which is beneficial for everyone involved."
5.0,"I loved this dress and how vibrant the colors are.  It is also super comfortable and perfect length, I will definitely buy this dress in a different color.  I just hope that the top doesn't stretch out and maintains its shape after wearing it the whole day. For reference, I am 5'6 and weight 163 and bought a medium."
5.0,Cute swimsuit.
5.0,"Purchased as a gift for my wife and looks fantastic on her.  Not too tight or revealing.  Sexy, but classy."
5.0,Great packaging and arrived on time. I love the long scraft. Great material and conforms well for head wrapping.
5.0,"I LOVE this bag!! I was looking for a cross body that could hold all of what I wanted to carry but something that I couldn't &#34;over stuff&#34; and this bag is PERFECT!!! It has a lot of pockets both on the inside and outside to keep smaller objects organized. I can easily fit my essentials (wallet, keys, glasses/sunglasses, phone, etc.) along with my water bottle, kindle, and a few other items!"
5.0,excellent product 1000% recommended.  Beautiful and quality.  would buy it again
5.0,Really nice charm. The edges are very precise. Looks nice on the bracelet.
5.0,Such a sleek vest. My golfer partner uses it all the time. It works!
5.0,"These are really nice cufflinks. They‚Äôre great with a white or black French cuff shirt. They don‚Äôt look incredibly lavish, but they are sleek and look good. Overall I am satisfied."
5.0,I LOVE these! They're incredibly comfortable and breathable.
5.0,Perfect gift for my son who got a red avenger. Quality product.
5.0,"Very cool shoes .. I love the smooth patent leather and soles of theses shoes are cool. Very comfortable inside with a quality build. No problems walking around in these. They fit as expect, I normally wear size 10, and they are fine."
5.0,Great price for the quantity. Worked just great in my Digital TDS Water tester and with few toys that my kid has.
5.0,"I've bought this brand of gloves a couple of times by now (in bulk). I am allergic to latex AND nitrile, so vinyl gloves are my new best friend now! These gloves are awesome. They are snug, do not have any funny smells, they come on time, they do not rip easily. One of the shipments I had gloves that seemed smaller than the previous times, but it hasn't caused a problem. I will continue to buy them."
5.0,Gorgeous dress!  Very happy with this purchase! Planning to wear to a wedding. Can‚Äôt wait!
5.0,The fit was great. Didn't particularly care for the zipper but it's ok. It is beautiful.  I love it.
5.0,"So far, they are good. Also received as stated. I will purchase again from you üòÉ"
5.0,My son wore this as Doctor Who for Halloween and it was perfect!
5.0,"What an Awesome piece of jewelry! Very sturdy feeling, almost heavy. The size is great...not too big or too small. I am very pleased with this purchase. Now if they made matching earrings, I would really be happy!"
5.0,"Soft, comfortable and stylish!"
5.0,"Me encant√≥ el producto, siempre quise tener unas gafas de montura de madera, son muy c√≥modas y livianas, no molestan al usarlas por mucho tiempo y tienen una est√©tica incre√≠ble. Las recomiendo totalmente ya que pueden ser usadas por hombres y mujeres indistintamente, f√°ciles de transportar por que tienen un case de madera muy port√°til."
5.0,It's a cute bag.Lots of room.
5.0,Love this. I'm so glad I ordered it
5.0,Cute and comfortable. The fabric is light and almost silky to the touch.
5.0,Really cute charm
5.0,It‚Äôs really pretty and I love it. I believe it‚Äôs slightly smaller than regular size. But still fit.
5.0,"Husband and I used these for a last minute trip to Spain. We only take a carry on when we travel, we never check a bag. So, these backpacks were really handy as our ""personal item"". They can hold a lot but squish easily under the airplane seat. We used them for day hikes, tours, and just walking around the city. We used them for a day hike, and as shopping bags at the market. They were a  good way to carry everything we needed and still have plenty of extra storage for souvenirs we might pick up yhat day.<br />The straps are surprisingly well padded. The zippers seem strong. The outer material is wayer resistant. There are many great features! I love how lightweight it is and how it folds up into a nice pouch that you can throw in your suitcase.<br /><br />Sadly, I have to dock a star because the inner lining separating the two pack sections detached from the pack lining the first day. That fabric is super thin and not sewn on well. So, the bag is still useable, its just one big compartment instead of two. I am not sure how long these bags will actually last, though.<br /><br />For the low price the rest of the construction is good. We feel we got our money worth already in Spain.  Overall, I think it was worth having them for our trip, and if they can last us a few more trips then that would be an awesome bonus. We have three trips in 2020 (2 cruises and a hiking trip) so we are going to be taking these bags with us again!"
5.0,I haven‚Äôt had a chance to wear it yet but the quality is great for the price. Looks & fit like the pic
5.0,"Best pants I've ever had!  Resists dog hair and lint.  I wear several days at a time because they always look fresh and no wrinkles.  The nylon and spandex makes them drape, unlike the cotton based pants.  Can hit the floor and do yoga with ease without changing into workout clothes."
5.0,The fit and material
5.0,A great buy. Kids loved them.!
5.0,This is a great item.  We bought as a gift for our kids<br /><br />This is such a hit and always played with<br /><br />They love the easy handles that move the players<br /><br />Great players and pucks sizes<br /><br />This is a sturdy set and you can lay on a table or play on ground.<br /><br />There are stands available to purchase with this but its not necessary to play.<br /><br />I would suggest buying extra pucks as though it comes with some you will lose them<br /><br />You can ALSO interchange the players and there are other specifics teams and players you can buy
5.0,It's looks really pretty. This necklace was a gift for my boss because she loves anchors and she told me she gets a lot of compliments!!
5.0,"Because of Plantar Fasciitis I have decided to give  this brand  a try. It fit perfectly. I know because I had to  have a pair tailored for me recommended by my podiatrist before. I am so pleased with &#34; Nazaroo brand&#34;  I bought a second pair. They fit perfectly in sneaker, shoes, winter boot.. And I walk everywhere. I am totally satisfied."

5.0,This is really cute v neck bikini set that fits amazing. I found it to be true to size and I like that there is good bottom coverage without it being too cheeky. The top is a v neck and the straps (which are adjustable) cross in the back. The bottoms are solid and the top is a blue/pink almost tie dye  pattern. I really like that there is enough support in the chest area and I felt like I could easily move around without things being exposed. Highly recommend!
5.0,These socks are exactly what we were looking for to recreate a picture from the 80s. The twins love em

5.0,These are adorable
5.0,"Small but only in the shoulder area.  Love it, super cute, for the record I'm 5'6&#34; and 135 lbs.  Ordered an XL and it fits like a loose medium.  I'm blonde so lacing it up myself took a few tries but I was able to conquer it!"

5.0,Just what I wanted and they are easy to screw in! Perfect buy.

5.0,Belliiiixima.

5.0,Very nice keychain
5.0,"Super, super, super soft- my daughter loved them. Will wear them at school on pajama day!"
5.0,"It looked better than expected, it wouldn't rust like some other metal ones I've bought other places my only mistake was sleeping with it which caused it to break apart and lose some of its leaves. The bell was extremely annoying but its easy to fix that"
5.0,These are HUGE
5.0,This is the perfect swim bottom if you need a little tucking in. The fabric is thick enough to do that. I have tried  numerous brands and I am going to be purchasing more of this line.
5.0,This dress feels good and looks awesome
5.0,Sooooooooo cute! It has plenty of space for all my cards and it's the perfect size! I'm obsessed with this wallet!
5.0,It‚Äôs a very beautifully fitting necklace
5.0,So beautiful! Easter i wore this so beautiful

5.0,Works perfectly to dress up or dress down.
5.0,So sweet
5.0,This is a cool looking crocheted bun cover.. I need a bobby pin or 2 to keep it in place like most others I have.. But looks good and made well!
5.0,"Great quality-purchased for summer purse, and lots of good pockets"
5.0,"This particular one is going to be a gift. I chose this to give because I have one and just love it! It‚Äôs small, but I am able to put a surprisingly amount of things in it and there is a separate zippered outside pocket perfect for my cell phone - a very well made bag! I love the fact that I can use it as a shoulder bag or a cross-body bag just by changing the strap. A perfect bag for vacationing and shopping - leave that bigger and heavier bag at home!"
5.0,"I've been buying these shirts for years. They're great for the more fitted look and great for the price. I'm 6"" 155lbs and the medium fits as I would like."
5.0,Great pair of earrings buying some more!

5.0,"I have struggled to find a good pair of thick quality socks to wear when I am out running. I have worn these socks twice now and I have to admit they are one of the best on the market to wear with sneakers. There are a lot of options to choose from when thinking about what socks you want to order and may be wondering why get these when there are name brand socks to choose from. The answer is simply that quality for the price is way better than any named brand products I have had. I also really like how these socks are stretchy and are the perfect length, they are able to cover my entire foot without being seen too much unlike other socks which are longer. Another thing about these socks that I love are the fact that they keep my feet really warm. I wear my Ugg's a lot and thin socks can make them not as warm and more uncomfortable,  but because these socks are so thick I get a lot of warmth from them. I would definitely recommend!"
5.0,I love my new boots!! They fit perfect to my size and my taste. They also got to my house quickly
5.0,"Love it, thanks!"
5.0,"The jacket is really made of legit leather, and the price is coherent with the quality (which is great by the way). It‚Äôs really warm and comfortable, plus the shipping was extra efficient as the jacket arrived two days earlier than expected, even though it was delayed for 2 days at customs."
5.0,Wore this Jersey to work. I knew it would get a reaction from the many diehard blues fans. Most were like hey what the. Then the looked at the name.

5.0,Perfect fit..super comfortable fabric..great buy!!

5.0,"It works perfectly for what I needed. It's stretchy so it can fit anyone, but doesn't pull too tight once it's on. It's a great fashion belt"
5.0,"The suit has the same color as shown in the picture, which is a beautiful blue. It fits comfortably. Good buy!"
5.0,"Comfy, soft, good fit, touch screen works. Boom done deal."

5.0,Beautiful bracelet for my sisters birthday.
5.0,I bought this for my husband to have on vacation as a lightweight jacket for PA. It is great for a cool night and is soft on the inside. I appreciate the variety of colors. He got the light grey. Great jacket.
5.0,I purchased a medium and it fits well.
5.0,My iphone fits in the wallet. it serves a dual purpose. For money and for cellphone into one wristlet.
5.0,Very comfortable material
5.0,many compliments!
5.0,Beautiful crown. Perfect quality too!
5.0,"They came promptly with no damage.<br /><br />These chums have saved my sun glasses three times in two weeks!  The bright color made it easier to quickly locate them floating down the river in a recent tubing trip.<br /><br />Over all, they're a great product, at a good cost."
5.0,"Very flattering No matter your figure, you can rock this."
5.0,Love these. Thank you. Just had some trouble putting them together. Couldn't figure it out.
5.0,My wife loves her dri fit shirts.

5.0,Ugh this is so comfy! Easy to dress up or down. Also so soft I have worn to bed. Don't judge.
5.0,What I like about the product is that it is a beautiful gift to have for your friend or family member.
5.0,Is gonna be a  christmas gift
5.0,These PJs fit perfectly and not too tight. Very comfy.
5.0,"Good, Good, Good"
5.0,I love this briefcase. I am getting so many compliments. It is really beautiful and big enough for my laptop. Thank you!
5.0,I like this shirt
5.0,My son is 3yrs and when I got him those shoes he did not take it off for the entire afternoon.It was only when he went to bed that I was able to take them off.........They are so cool looking.
5.0,I've been trying multiple stocking and leggings for compression and these do it for me!! Not too tight or loose and they are not too hard to put on.  I like the footless so I can wear flip flops or put on compression socks if I want and they make my legs look amazing with my skort for active wear without showing all my legs imperfections.  I'm 5'4 170lbs and the large fit great.  Not every body type fits all leggings or stockings so you really do have to find the right fit for your body type. Plus be aware of cheap knockoffs... I plan to get alot of wear out of them.. nice look and feel and a good quality and I feel alot more confident and sexy and does feel a mild circulation to prevent swelling which is the goal.  For those who say it rolls down might have different body type or consider wearing a shaper in top of them.  Nothing wrong with looking snatched!
5.0,"Purchased in March and within two months tarnished. Surprised as this is not the expected quality of C & C. It costs $75 to replate. Not happy. UPDATE, C & C was contacted and within 24 hours the problem has been resolved. I am expecting a replacement once I return the original. Thank you C & C for standing behind your product"
5.0,"This is a very nice shirt, the flannel is nice and soft, much nicer than a lot of other flannels I've purchased, and it's also a nice thick flannel, anyone who likes flannel shirts knows that a lot of the shirts on the market are made from a really poor grade of flannel that feels really thin and hard, this shirt feels nice and thick and soft, the sizes do run a little small, but take that into consideration when ordering, and you're gonna love this shirt. I received this shirt for free or at a reduced price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review"
5.0,This pendent will surely get you noticed that you mean business and are deep in the Divine. It will keep away pesky people who might be intimidated by just seeing you with it on.<br />It seems to enhance your protection power and make you feel grounded and centered as soon as you hold it... Much less put it on. VERY POWERFUL ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èüôå
5.0,Fits good on a slim body type. Received some good complements. Material is good and seems it will last.
5.0,I bought this for my friends daughter for her birthday and it fits really cute very good quality very very cute dress I will definitely buy from this company again
5.0,"This was a St. Patrick's day present for my mom. I had it sent to my house first because I was going to keep it if it wasn't good quality. It feels heavy and the engraving on the beads is fairly faint so it doesn't look over the top. Am not familiar with the blessing being removed if money changes hands for a blessed object, but I guess I could take it to my parish priest and have it blessed again.<br /><br />The rosary was nicely packaged and arrived a day early."
5.0,This dress is perfect! For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 106lbs and a 24‚Äù waist. I ordered the xs and it fit me well. It was slightly loose in the waist but I figured that would be the case as I have a difficult time finding things small enough anyway. I brought this dress with me on a recent trip to Paris & it was the most fabulous thing. I had locals stopping me everywhere telling me how beautiful it was. A+!
5.0,Beautiful n soft. Love it.
5.0,"Very cute, functional and well made."
5.0,I got these for my fife saver for my wedding I got some bookmarks that had hearts on them that said thanks for sharing our day then I tie the double hearts at the top which already had the string and hole there then put my husband and my name with date of wedding day on the bottom of bookmark got a rubber stamper at amozon also to put name loved it
5.0,Absolutely love these jeans. So comfortable and I love that you can get them in such long sizes for us tall girls.
5.0,I love this product so much!
5.0,Legis
5.0,Let's just say I love this top!
5.0,was what i was wanting.
5.0,"These are really gorgeous pants. Very unique and flattering. This is the third pair I have purchased. The solid colors are fantastic. The prints are a bit more sheer but they are beautiful, light and flowing. I get many compliments on them. They are cotton fabric and have held up well after several washings. A great value and addition to your wardrobe."
5.0,My daughter loves these pajamas. Great purchase.
5.0,Beautiful!!! Very detailed. It is about the size of an American .50 coin. Pretty.
5.0,It's the perfect souvenir that they don't sell at the Maker's Mark distillery.
5.0,"The dress is definitely a small make. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 140 lbs. I originally ordered size medium and large but those did not fit so I had to go to XL which I have never worn anything that size before. I did order the XXL and it was huge on me. However, once I tried on the XL I was in love with the dress. It is great quality and worth the money. The gloves are a shade off from the dress but I didn‚Äôt care about that. I order a fake rose which went nice with the costume along with the wig. I bought a 4-Hoop A-Line Floor Length Ball Gown Petticoat Underskirt to lift the dress up since it was so long. Overall, I was very pleased. I used it for my workplace Halloween costume contest and we WON!!!!! We were the Disney Beauties!"
5.0,Suggest to order a size up...seem to run a bit small.  Well designed to keep hands warm.
5.0,My fianc√© loves hiking so I bought him this hat to wear while we are out and about. He loves it! Super comfortable and fits great. Really high quality as well. Will definitely order from this shop again!
5.0,Felt well for a little bit big just little hard to get used to even though I already wore 3.0
5.0,"I purchased this watch because it was the least expensive way to get a replacement watchband for my 25+ year old Casio--the same model. This watch has served me well over the years and has exactly the features that I need: readable digital face, date, alarm function, and easily modifiable display.  The nightlight is a plus. Can't beat the price for the value. Glad to see that this classic is still available."
5.0,This is the sweetest little necklace ever. I still can't believe the price!
5.0,"Love the hat, however the color is Nantucket red not pink. My husband is wearing too."
5.0,Will definitely need ironing but fits like it was made for me.
5.0,"I find these compression socks to be very effective and worth a try.  I wash and dry these socks as I would all my clothes, in a washing machine on warm cycle and the dryer using warm cycle."
5.0,This piece was so beautiful. I received so many compliments. Love it!
5.0,Love the dress.. fits well and material is great.
5.0,Love these pants!! They‚Äôre a great texture and the prettiest color! Love the drawstring as well!
5.0,Gorgeous. I wear a 12 and fit true to size in a large. If you really want to show curves you can go a size smaller üòâ
5.0,Cute and comfy.  What else can you ask for?
5.0,I bought for a gift for my own unicorn lover. She has just moved to a colder climate and I am certain she will be warm and styling as she goes to Kindergarten.
5.0,This is exactly what my three year old needed. It looks great and is made well.
5.0,We needed this for an active teen that had an elbow injury. We got a Med for a 16y/o teen. It worked out well.
5.0,my husband loves it.  it looks very expensive.  packaged very nicely for a gift.  classy and simple.  soft leather. smells good like leather should.  I just bought another one because my husband did the laundry and it doesn't hold up so well when submerged in water...;)
5.0,I‚Äôve been using this belly ring for months now and it still looks brand new
5.0,Cute fit great
5.0,Very pleased. Would like to order again
5.0,It fits great and I love the length too!!
5.0,bought this for my great aunt for mothers day and her birthday after her husband died on her birthday which is bittersweet
5.0,"I chose the red lens, black frame model simply because they look best to me. I have a rather large skull mostly because it's filled with a double dose of brain matter, that and I'm a proud Native American so it can be a challenge to find high quality eyewear that fit comfortably & correctly. These glasses fit my bulbous gord perfectly, the view is crisp & precise. I get many positive comments plus the phone number of a very attractive lady after our conversation was initiated by her interest in my sexy glasses."
5.0,Nice quality.  Nice fit
5.0,"This is absolutely the cutest bracelet and very good quality. I bought it for my sister in law because her daughter plays travel softball. She loved it very much. It is pretty great quality, the latch stays firmly closed the entire time that you are wearing it. The bracelet is a bright silver and has not changed colors at all in the months that she has had it. I highly recommend this bracelet to someone looking for a Mom/softball themed bracelet. (I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review)"
5.0,"Beautifully made, large, heavy necklace. Have had many compliments on it. Leather cord was longer than I expected and clasp doesn't stay fastened."
5.0,It is almost plastic like. But comfortable. The color is beautiful.
5.0,i love these charms they are super cute and went great with my charm bracelet i had put togther for myself
5.0,Very nice pieces they are a little tight.
5.0,Finally purchased masks that fit well and are comfortable and adjust well around nose. They do well laundering too.
5.0,"Bought a few of these for christmas for my nieces, so many to pick from. all different styles and colors. made christmas shopping easier."
5.0,"I love this top! I ordered 3 so far! In black, white and turquoise.  The shirt is extremely stretchy but because they are Asian sizes, order a size or 2 up. I ordered an XXL and the top fits well (like a med-large american) but is very long on me. I am only 5'1, so I just wear it with leggings and it looks really cute. Next time I might order a XL just so its not so long. The top fits well. Edited to add: Have since ordered this shirt in an additional color. I ordered the green listed here. FYI- fits great, but not army green as shown on computer screen. Closer to a pea green or sort of light yellowish green. Still cute tho!"
5.0,This belt is build better than the wrangler one sold by Kmart
5.0,I received many compliments
5.0,"I‚Äôm very impressed with how well this dress fit, definitely very true to size. It hugs you in all the right places and the color is just stunning. This dress can easy be dressed up or worn casually. It is a stretchy fabric and extremely comfortable. Doesn‚Äôt feel restricting at all. Great dress, worth every penny!"

5.0,"True to size, nice dry fit."
5.0,"Comfortable, just had to be careful going from lighted areas to darker areas because there is some visual issues"
5.0,I bought this for my 14 yr old grandson not sure if he would like it or not.  Well he loves it and has not taken it off since I gave it to him.
5.0,"These are fantastic, tough nylon Ice material, 5 times stronger than pantyhose material, got nude color , barely see thru, I'm 6 foot 185 pounds, legs are plenty long, double seams in front go around each side of your junk, single seam in back, works exceptionally well and keeps you tight and flat especially if you tuck. Have to say these are most fantastic,  light compression , tightest on my 21 inch  thighs, but still enough room, could fit someone larger, waist band is good size and holds them up, they don't ride down like pantyhose."
5.0,this is beautiful and I love it
5.0,Exactly what's advertised!!!  Perfect for everyday use or special occasions.  I'd purchase again!
5.0,"So let's go over the design, it's killer all thwir is to it good quality paint and all.<br /><br />I collect motercycles and out of the helmets i have i like this one the most i have 0,complaints. Came as it should have well packaged visor works as should and so do,sun glasses works great in cold weather."
5.0,"When I got my septum pierced back in June my piercer was out of the normal 16g piercing rings, so he pierced my septum at a 14g. I grew so fond of the ‚Äúchunkyness‚Äù of the 14g and decided to stick with it. As I researched I found out that 14g septum rings are hard to come by. I was able to find these ones and I fell in love with them! I like the length of the ring. It‚Äôs perfect! I didn‚Äôt want my ring to be to long or too short. These ones are perfect!"
5.0,As described. Fits as expected. Very comfortable.
5.0,Perfectly loose fit that I've been looking for along with the length!  Modestly worn and attractive!!!
5.0,Got it for wife and she loves it. Looks very nice.
5.0,"Pendants were great quality & came quickly, very happy with product & delivery package."
5.0,Watch works fine and is what I expected. Thanks.
5.0,I bought this because now and then I have a top that is simply too long looking since I am so short.  I lost the other one I had but this is just about exactly like what I had.  And it adds to your outfits as well.
5.0,"I was very surprised at the quality and thickness of this coat, my son loves it it's comfortable and very warm"
5.0,Love these shorts. The pockets make a huge difference! Love them.
5.0,I sent this in a sleepover camp care package to my 15 Year old. He said it was big hit!

5.0,LOVE THESE!  Also got the suede....officially my new faves!!!!
5.0,Great. Hard to find shoes.
5.0,"These are of good quality.  And, what I like is that they have the No slip grip on the inside at the back of the heel.  The stockings fit good,  the material is good quality.  I like the different colors.  These type of footlets are critical for summer, because you don't want to wear full socks.<br /><br />The stockings fit secure for me.  I wear a size 5 and 1/2 shoe size, so these fit good.  They also wash good."
5.0,"Really good Quality, but really hard to put on bracelet"
5.0,This dress is darling on. I like the pockets.
5.0,This watch looks elegant. My sister loves it!
5.0,Love these! I was super skeptical the quality would be as good as other reviewers mentioned... well it 100% is! These are just as good of quality as my gymshark leggings if not better. The seems feel solid and like they won‚Äôt fray and the material is amazing. Super thin yet squat proof and moves with you as you‚Äôre working out.
5.0,My grandsons love these shirts!!! What a great shirt.  Shirt fits true to suze

5.0,My daughter loves
5.0,"I really like the material of this dress, it fits well and would be a great dress however I need it in another color"
5.0,Very cute got a lot of compliments.
5.0,"This will be my second one of these, gave the first one away when I left my sales position. Found myself doing sales again and need a new one.This is a great holder, held up nicely when I had the other one and always received compliments on it."
5.0,This fits nicely. Followed size graph but could have gone down a size. Keeping as very comfortable for walking and working out.
5.0,"Received in a timely manner and was pleased with the fit and finish. As one reviewer stated, it will kink occasionally, but I've been able to work them out. I wear it on a daily basis to carry an ARC-P light for quick access."

5.0,Purchased as a gift. Looks exactly like it was advertised. Absolutely adorable.
5.0,"I really like this shirt. It hangs  beautifully. It is very pretty and would probably go as well with dress pants as it does with jeans.  Even living in the hot and humid South, it is not too hot. I say this because I worried at first about the material. Does not easily wrinkle."
5.0,Perfect fit and really good quality.
5.0,I like it because it‚Äôs so comfortable
5.0,perfect size for two people. used on a 10 motorcycle trip to Mexico. very handy and roomy.
5.0,They look great in my ears.
5.0,I accidentally clicked the wrong thing and left a bad review that I cant seem to delete- it was supposed to be for another company and another product- I LOVE THESE PANTS- I bought a pair and tie dyed them and they came out amazing I am absolutely in love
5.0,I love them! theyre sparkly and cute. It brings three pairs!
5.0,"The charms arrived just yesterday, and in time for me to make jewelry for our town's upcoming Village Faire . They were very carefully packaged and looked exactly as shown. Very happy with the purchase, will definitely buy again. Thanks so much!"
5.0,"Super glasses case!  I got mine years ago from Levenger (1990), and it's just finally wearing out.  (26 years, folks!)  And that's only the lining (which is hefty)  - - where the hinge of the glasses rubbed.  I could make do for another 26 years (I should live so long!), but I'm treating myself to a new one.  (I probably will keep my old one as a spare, though, since it still functions perfectly.)<br /><br />No problems at all with the plastic zippers.  They've stayed on track.  Zipper end stop is hidden in the placket so it won't pull free, as many zippers do, thus ruining the zipper bcs it then falls apart.<br /><br />The &quot;bicycle belt loops&quot; on the back are just as firmly attached as when I got the case.  (I use them visually to identify which side holds my sunglasses, not on a fanny pack or belt.  I see the new model has color-coded zipper pulls.  Nice feature.)<br /><br />There's a gusset on the side, which is not shown in the pix.  This gives way to a double-dart.  These give the case shape and width, enabling the glasses to go in and out easily.  There's an additional piece of leather btw the 2 zipper.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm ordering a new one; so glad I found it!  I was afraid I wouldn't.<br /><br />No other glasses case I've ever had has been as good and as sturdy.  Nice and roomy.  If your glasses are less &quot;thick&quot;, the case easily compresses.<br /><br />Leather is so soft and luxurious!  Great craftsmanship!  You can see that although the color is beginning to wear off the end, the leather has  maintained its integrity.  Red makes it easy to identify in purse or briefcase.<br /><br />Don't hesitate.  You won't be disappointed.  There are cheaper cases, but this one is made to last and worth every penny.<br />mb"
5.0,"Beautiful , great fit and you can use it around the house, elegant, already bought two others"
5.0,This set is seriously so soft. The unfinished edges and color make me feel like I'm wearing a Kardashian lounge set. It is a little small in my opinion and I (F) purchased the mens thinking it may be a little bigger. This is my current favorite lock down lounge wear outfit.
5.0,"Very comfortable, and they stay up!"
5.0,Awesome dress. A bit long but nothing some wedges can‚Äôt solve!
5.0,ordered for work
5.0,Cute! Perfect for wearing with ankle booties and cropped trousers or a jumpsuit. Would probably be cute with a dress too. Decent quality for the price and they were packaged well. Good socks.
5.0,I absolutely love this purse! It fit‚Äôs everything I need
5.0,"Bought these for my fiance. He's a size 13, which is hard to find for such a great price. They look just as pictured, and he says they are comfy. Also fit true to size. We ordered size 13, and the fit is perfect."
5.0,It fits perfect. It is a good thing that i ordered half number bigger.but the only thing that i am not so fond of is that the carved roses are small .
5.0,This is an amazing dress. It‚Äôs so comfortable. The material inside is soft. It looks so sexy on! Definitely recommend. I am planning on buying another one in a different color.
5.0,Cute. Well made.
5.0,Love these. They fit perfectly and are super comfortable. The material is soft. Wish I had these when I was nursing my children because they would have been perfect.
5.0,These are so comfortable and beautiful.
5.0,"Loved it elegant and classy, I got many compliments"
5.0,Beautiful wrist band for my 44mm 4series watch. Not too much bling but just right to have a little pizzazz to your watch. I have a small wrist size (6 1/4 inch) and the smaller band fit just right.
5.0,"I haven't wore these sandals out yet, however in trying them on and walking throughout my home, they are AWESOME!  I can't wait for spring, my sandals and I are out of here (this house..lol)"
5.0,Great price for this product.
5.0,I love these running pants. It gets really cold where I live but these help tremendously.
5.0,Great for my 5 year old. True to size. Comfortable. Warm enough for chilly nights. I have several.
5.0,"Love the shirt, there was  a quality problem with it, but the company quickly took care of it. Would order from them again in the future"
5.0,"If you‚Äôre a server/bartender you need to get this asap! Perfect size, I love it"
5.0,This  dress was amazing on me everyone been asking me from where I got it &#60;3 you should buy &#60;#
5.0,"Love this dress! It fits well. Ordered an XXL because I am rather busty, so I will probably wear a scarf with it, but all in all it is very nice."
5.0,Bomb. Super good quality for this price.<br />Very worth.
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my dad (he just turned 52), because he had seen it on Bucket List (a movie with Morgan Freeman and Jack Nickelson), and thought it was really cool. Sometimes, he has to lay down for long periods of time (he has back pain, and gout) and this was the best gift I could've gotten him. I'm very pleased with it. Not only is it fun to have some laughs, it really is helpful."
5.0,Perfect! Draw string keeps the gaiter on my face to block the wind. Soft and pretty color
5.0,I bought this for my son and he loves it very good bag
5.0,"I love this sweater. I received soooo many compliments on it the first time I wore it. Best of all, my 18 year old fashionista asked to borrow it!"
5.0,It was likeable
5.0,In love with this dress
5.0,The dress was pretty and I wore it to a Christmas party.
5.0,This is a cute necklace. The only thing that bothers me is that it flipps over so you see the back instead of the front but for the price you can't beat it!
5.0,Soft material and fits very comfortably well.
5.0,Great quality. Heavy. Chocker fit.
5.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful piece
5.0,Such a cute hat.  Gotten many compliments on it.  Seems very warm and soft.
5.0,I love this hat!  It is a beautiful color and it is not a heavy material which is great!!  I bought it to go with my Chistmas shirt on Amazon that has leopard print on the picture of the truck that has Merry Christmas on the shirt.
5.0,I'm 5'2 and it fit perfectly. Sleeve length and length of shirt right below my waist. I normally have an issue with sleeves and shirts being too long. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"PS-80 Great as a transdermal adjunctive of nutrients and medications. Potentially hazardous in that it will transfer any liquid into and through the skin be it healthful or not. There is a possable build-up of this in the skin and body that can have very unhealthy effects. It is considered &#34;safe&#34; in that it originates in nature in wheat germ seed oil in small amounts. Seedlings use polyethoxylated sorbitan and oleic acid to boost the transpiration of water and nutrients to cells for growth. PS-80 is a refinement and stripped of unnecessary compounds that the natural source provides for plants. So thinking of it as a nutritional transporter on the skin seems to be useful...if your skin is very clean and remains very clean...an hour after its use on your foot, apply a drop of vanilla on a spot on your foot and see how long it takes to taste it."
5.0,"Really like the product, not see through and a full length separating zipper is a plus.  The fabric is soft and feels nice.  Size appropriate and like the long length at 5'1"" comes down to ankle.  Pockets are useful also."
5.0,My grand-daughter gave this clip to her best friend who is a panda lover.  The friend loved it.  I was happy for them.
5.0,This short fits perfect
5.0,Awesome shirt!
5.0,"Cute, was scared cause I have size 10 feet but fit good"
5.0,"Great product!!! The first time we used it a few of the bristles came out of the brush, but we haven't had any issues since then. We have cleaned about 10 pairs of shoes and still have over a half of bottle of cleaner left. This is a great product to help you maintain the shoes you spent a lot of money to look good in. Will definitely buy another bottle once this one runs out if it ever does..."
5.0,The hat works well. We love it and would buy it again . Thanks
5.0,This is a heavy duty bag with thick leather.
5.0,"Soft shirt and great detachable cape. Velcro pieces are well sewn on each side of the garment and places so that he could put the cape on himself if he wanted to. Nice length to the cape and did not shrink in the wash. The faces of the paw patrol characters are made of thicker vinyl-like material that makes the shirt hotter on the inside, but the faces are small and spaced well enough that it doesn't hold in a lot of heat and make my son sweat as much as other character shirts printed with that material vs screenprinted directly into the shirts. My three year old loves it."
5.0,Love the colors of the bag and it can compliment any outfit.
5.0,"My little one is seven and the choker was a bit big for her, but it worked perfectly fine! My little one loved it!! It is made for women anyways, but it was shipped out so quickly and came just in time for trick or treat!!!"
5.0,I may have to get more.  Love the fit and is so comfortable.  Not too short so I‚Äôd work appreciate.
5.0,Absolutely love! These definitely stay put when my hair is pulled back during HIIT and running unlike other brands that constantly slip. The thickness is just right and the soft velvet lining is super comfy. Great colors and prints to choose from. Been purchasing these for years. They hold up well. üëèüèº
5.0,"I wanted a sheer coverup to wear over some leggings as opposed to wearing longer blouses or sweaters since it's been very hot here where I live. This was perfect.  I ordered a Large because it was coming from China and they are quite smaller over there.  I wear a size 4 and it was a little big, I could've went with a medium.  The fabric is very sheer but that's what I wanted. Shipping took about 2 weeks and it was very well packaged."
5.0,"beautiful watch, very different, wearing it only for dress up.."
5.0,"The cable works exactly as it should, both when the system is in sleep mode and when actively playing. I hooked it up to my portable rechargeable battery pack and it works just fine. The cable arrived promptly and without issue, definitely recommend buying."
5.0,"This is Robet's wife.  I collect Casio Baby ""G"" watches.  They are durable and the batteries last for years.  And they come a  lots of cute styles"
5.0,"I was today's retro, just needed t afro. However, I was still a blew up look! Killin t kudos with this vest."
5.0,I always wear it in the shower and it‚Äôs still looking good
5.0,"Order normal size, it's super comfortable and straps on bra and garter belts are adjustable. I ordered a similar item from VS and the fabric on this one was much more comfortable! The bra doesn't have any support so if you have a chest bigger than a b your natural shape will show. I think it's fine that way! Great value for the price."
5.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful gift. Well handled and shipping came very quickly!
5.0,Would have liked it a little bit longer but I love the dress.
5.0,Super cute sleep gown for my newborn! Love the floral pattern. Makes nighttime changes easy :)
5.0,"Nice material, they look really good and quality is good. The material feel like silk. The tie at the top with the scrunch waist is complimenting to the shape. Very professional and bussiness/business casual attire!"
5.0,"This dress is fantastic! I bought a size 4, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 120 pounds. My waist is smaller so the dress fits a bit loose in that area but perfect everywhere else. For 23 dollars, the dress feels good, it‚Äôs not high end but it certainly does not feel cheap. I would buy again in other designs!"
5.0,"Its very light weight and airy, exactly what I was hoping for. Will be purchasing more of this item."
5.0,"So practical and soft. Really nice purse, perfect size, not too big and not too small. Ordered coffee color, love it!"
5.0,Came with both silver and gold. Both equally as beautiful.
5.0,"Very good quality, love the shirt"
5.0,Definitely worth more than what I paid! I would order this again. I bought it as a gift for my son in law and he loves it.
5.0,"loved it, so pretty and the price was so cheap for the quality. I bought one and they got another!"
5.0,Awesome styling and fit
5.0,"This fits me perfectly and a great shirt for my Mexico vacation this week. The band fits my 32D bra chest and I‚Äôm about 108lbs. The length is a little long, but not bad. Material is pretty thick, but I‚Äôm going to wear a tube  padded soft pull on bra with it I have from Nordstrom Rack as I do not like showing off my nipples. Color exactly as shown."
5.0,Im 6'3 250. Sometimes these hats are very small but this hat is perfect and great quality
5.0,Are really good bags.. I bought for my football team and had them embroidered... this is the second time getting these bags for a football team and the first ones are still holding up from 3 years ago....
5.0,"For just under $10 for three pair on Amazon, these gloves are pretty darn awesome!<br /><br />I use them for edging to prevent blisters. They work great!<br /><br />I used them for weeding the garden. They did the trick, they have super gripping rubber all over them.<br /><br />I used them for washing the dog. That was great! They didn't keep my hands completely dry but I would much rather scrub a nasty dirty dog with gloves on than without!<br /><br />I wore them while pruning my rose bushes and NO thorns were able to get through!<br /><br />They are one size fits most. They are made of 100% Nylon with nitrile coated palm to make them more durable and water resistant.<br /><br />They are lightweight and breathable.<br /><br />They are comfortable and easy to put on and take off.<br /><br />They are machine washable. I haven't washed mine, although the pair I washed the dog with should really get washed now that I'm thinking of it!"
5.0,definitely worth the money
5.0,I love this style of padded t-shirts... it really gives the oversized tshirt trend a feminine edge. I ordered the small and in my opinion it could be a little bit smaller... but I‚Äôm making it work! Still looks super cute and fashionable!
5.0,Shirt fits fine
5.0,Love how they fit.
5.0,"No complaints about the shirt. Well made, looks nice."
5.0,Love these slippers.  Warm and comfortable.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:de321750ff41afca76a54b3afeb212ee]] This product is AMAZING! If you have big hips GET IT. I think it will look good on all body types but this is perfect for my hour glass figure. It fits perfect. I‚Äôm a size 14-18 ish typically.
5.0,Wife loves these! She said very warm socks. Got them as Christmas gift for her!
5.0,Me encanta muy buena calidad quiero comprarme m√°s.
5.0,"Cleaning up in a dental environment, these are comfortable and durable."
5.0,Love the earrings. Need more options to choose from.
5.0,"I ordered a 3x and was worried that the dress would be too tight. It wasn't. Dress was thinner than expected, but not bad for a summer dress. Packs well and wrinkles were easy to steam out without disturbing the pleats."
5.0,Locks on to my glasses and fits great.
5.0,Prefect fit I bought 2 pairs for my daughters they both have wide fit but both pairs fit prefect
5.0,Love this product! Would recommend
5.0,Love the way they look and fit one of my favorite sunnies
5.0,"They are stretchy, I buy 1 size down. Anytime the prize drops I buy a pair or 2."
5.0,"I tried this strap out today and I'm happy to report it surpassed my expectations. Well, I started out with pretty low expectations since my first yoga strap snapped only after a few uses. I used my stretch band to tie my yoga mat in place but that got old really fast. I didn't want to settle for a yoga bag (I can't see myself patiently rolling the mat as tight as can be, straighten out the bag and slide it over the mat then admire my creation.. Nope, not for me.)  I just wanted to roll up my mat and go.<br /><br />I make most of my purchase decisions based on the reviews left by honest and unbiased fellow customers. But with this one, I didn't bother. I mean, after reading review after review, who do you really trust for an honest and unbiased opinion? Also, it's a yoga strap, not a life support machine.<br /><br />I'm 5' 7&#34;, slender build and this yoga strap with my mat rolled in it hit me around my hips, exactly where I would wanted it to. In the picture, it's slanted on the mannequin so I wasn't sure if it would be long enough for me. But the length was perfect. The material is sturdy to hold it's shape but not stiff so it bends easily around. I feel the stitches are sturdy too, not flimsy. The loop can be adjusted easily so you don't have to spend that last ounce of strength to roll your mat meticulously. I wrapped mine up pretty loosely and the loop slid right on, tighten it's grip and I was ready to go. The strap feels smooth to the touch but it didn't slide of my shoulders, which was another plus. I haven't tried this during my practice, only because I just need a stretch band for my purposes, but I can see someone might benefit from using it as a strap in itself.  I, too, purchased this yoga strap at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I waited a few days until my yoga class to try it out and leave a review. If you're like me, and just want a no-fuss way to keep your yoga mat rolled up in between short walks to the car and class and stay that way in the car, get it. There's not much to lose here. I don't normally tell my friends to go out and buy the next best thing whatever it may be. I'd like to consider myself a prudent buyer with a hint of minimalism. But I also enjoy no fuss products that make your life a tad easier and if I ever need a second strap, I would pick this one over and over again. Thank you for reading my review!"
5.0,These work with my glasses well
5.0,Love these! Great material and flattering

5.0,Bought this for my sister and so far so good. She likes it and its easy to read.
5.0,"Looks sooo much better than the pic, I absolutely love it"
5.0,I am a very cold person.  This tank is better than a camisole.  I imagine it is like a man's undershirt.  It was cozy and comfy and kept me very warm.  I love it.
5.0,Very thick and warm. Wash well.
5.0,I love this mask I have made a bunch of snapchats with this mask and I am currently trying to get my friends to get this mask to go through drive thru at our local fast food places
5.0,definitely a comfort fit
5.0,"What a stunning bag! It's big, lots of room with a few compartments to put your stuff. You can feel the softness of the real leather!  SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS BAG!!"
5.0,"First off I normally have a very hard time buying Cosplay &quot;made to fit&quot; because I'm have such an awkward body shape and most the time end up doing major adjustments to the point I may as well have made it myself. But boy oh boy!! This costume came in and by my surprise, fits almost perfect. The pants are a bit loose around my legs and waist, but they fit much better than I anticipated. The material used is super great quality and the detail is wonderfully stitched. The company gave me an extra button in case you lose one, as well as sent a belt for the waist which most companies overlook. Minor details are missing, such as the skull on the back bottom panel of the jacket but easy enough to fix.<br />As for shipping time, the costume made it to me WAY faster than expected. Took a week, instead of the estimated 3 weeks, to ship.<br />Overall, very good quality for the money spent and will look to this company for future cosplays. 10/10 buy again.<br />Instagram me for any details: @senpapi.cosplay"
5.0,Washed and wore well
5.0,Ease of use. Monthly pages to write and full month to make notes with stickers included.

5.0,Nice hoodie and great price. Bought one for my boyfriend and he loves it. No regrets on this purchase.
5.0,The design and quality look
5.0,"Just a little too big, but I love it"
5.0,Durable and and worked as well as they should.  All the cousins got their own color and everyone enjoyed collecting shells at the beach.
5.0,I was surprised based on the price. These are the most comfortable jeans I've ever had. A little bit of stretch goes a long way to make this comfortable. Thinking of buying a few more in different colors now.
5.0,Good little umbrella. Thnx
5.0,"Work perfectly, as advertised. They keep my wiggle worm's socks on."
5.0,Shoulder & backline fit a little big.<br />But dress up. doesn't matter. Look is nice!!

5.0,Way smaller than I expected but still pretty :) didn't irritate my ears too!
5.0,matches my swing dresses perfectly
5.0,10/10
5.0,"I really like it. I‚Äôm always a little nervous buying on Amazon with clothes but it was perfect. I got an xl it was a little baggie but perfect. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù 4‚Äù but have a long torsos so I have a hard time finding stuff long enough and this long sleeve shirt was,the sleeves were also long as well."
5.0,"Love this dress-great length. I'm typically a size 10-5'7""- 145lbs.... great fit!"
5.0,"I really like this watch. It is as good looking as much more expensive military style watches.  The band was easy to adjust with the tool that was included and fits well.  The bezel does not rotate, and the case is thicker than I thought but that does not negate the watch in any way.  I have the all black version in stainless.  Time will tell, but it is off to a promising start."
5.0,nice leather . color beautiful
5.0,These are very well made and perfect for our toddlers tea party.  Fit little heads quite nicely.
5.0,"Light weight I‚Äôve worn them even in summer. Warm in winter to sleep in they are that comfortable. Great to wear alone or under a shirt for fall clean up  I‚Äôve replaced a lot of my old tee‚Äôs with these. Colors I have are black,navy,gray and white 2 of each love them."
5.0,"These are the best undergarment i have ever purchased! Soft , cool,and holds its shape.  Thank you very much."
5.0,Love these sunglasses! They're perfect!
5.0,"I have used Calabria reading glasses for years. I love the styles, the matching glasses cases, and the quality of the lenses. The price is very reasonable considering the excellent quality of the frames and lenses. I receive compliments all the time regarding these glasses. The frames last for at least 3 years with everyday use."
5.0,My daughter loves these shoes. I'm buying another pair in a larger size for future use.
5.0,It fits my 20 mos daughter perfectly.
5.0,Shades fit great .... üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüö¥üö¥üö¥
5.0,"My husband loved this dress, I wore it for a friend‚Äôs Sweet 16 birthday and I got multiple compliments for this dress."
5.0,"Good Quality- the socks are tight, so they stay up well. wouldn't recommend buying these if you have thicker thighs, as I am 5'4"" 118 and the socks were tight on me!"

5.0,"My son loves these shoes! He said they are very comfortable, and he runs a lot!"
5.0,"I have recently discovered that I love pearl jewelry and when I saw these, I knew they were a must to go with my pearl necklace and ring.<br /><br />They are stunning. You get a pearl AND sparkle in the same earring. They are very pretty and elegant and should go with almost any outfit. I really like how the pearls are positioned securely in the earrings, so that they are unlikely to get loose. The posts and backings on these earrings are high quality and very secure. I am amazed at the relatively low cost of these earrings. I have bought more expensive earrings that weren‚Äôt this good.<br /><br />My advice is to buy yourself a pair or buy them for a special lady. She will love them."
5.0,estos anteojos ne encantan
5.0,I use this to carry my credit cards in my pocket when I can‚Äôt carry and purse. Very sturdy and pretty.
5.0,This dress is amazing. So comfortable and can be worn in summer or perfect for fall with leggings.
5.0,"Ordered these because I didn‚Äôt want to spend the price of the high end brands of this style boot.  I wanted to first experiment how they would look and feel.  These boots are super cute, comfy, stylish and so different! They practically go with everything.  Wish I would have taken more pics but I rarely take pics, but wanted to show how they look on.  Super cute and want to buy more colors!"
5.0,My daughter love's her hoodie!  Thanks amazon. ........
5.0,"Believe when they say tiny! Nonetheless, they are really cute and original!  Loved them üòä"

5.0,I love this shirt! So comfy I literally slept in it the other night. Lol
5.0,Love this color!
5.0,"Wasn‚Äôt sure about the army green color. I ordered another color in case, but the green is my favorite. Very trendy."
5.0,These are a little bigger and heavier than I thought they'd be but they're still very pretty. They can be worn everyday but will also work for dressing up. Great deal for the price.
5.0,"Good quality,  Cute design for the larger size woman."
5.0,Got these for my daughter for her birthday and we love love love them!
5.0,"Even though I'll definitely use this pretty cover up for myself over a swimsuit, it will work perfectly for my boudoir photography business. I wanted something that was see-through for my clients that wanted a bit more coverage for their shoot. This will go with black or white lingerie and can also be worn a bit off-shoulder. Very versatile!"
5.0,"Just purchased this crossbody purse for my girlfriend as her old Jessica Simpson crossbody's strap broke after 2 years. She absolutely loves it! We purchased the Henna color and it's a darker more rich brown than what it looks like in the picture and she prefers the actual color much more. It's size is perfect, looks great and seems to be high quality. This is the 3rd Jessica Simpson purse I've gotten for my girlfriend and I cannot believe how good they look and how functional they are. Plus they are priced so cheap compared to so many others. Ridiculous this purse was only $34 could easily have been $60-$80 and we still would have been satisfied. She loves the extra length strap also, she's 5'10&#34; and the strap is perfect. Just a great product. 10/10"
5.0,Excellent quality. Excellent graphics
5.0,"So far I just tried these on because I broke my ankle before I could try them riding a bike. The padding felt strange but it's because I never wore padded shorts before. Even though it feels a little like wearing a diaper, it doesn't look that way. The shorts conformed to my shape but were easy to put on. I say it's somewhat small because I'm usually a size smaller in other clothes so I recommend ordering a size higher than what you normally wear or go by the sizing chart. I can't wait to try them out! I will update on the comfort of the ride after my ankle heals."
5.0,My 5 year old looked stunning.
5.0,It has clean crisp look.
5.0,"Great item to wear, quality and size makes it a perfect accessory to my view.<br />and most important clipping mechanism works perfectly<br />worry less item to wear on therefore :)"
5.0,Great price. Very sturdy bag
5.0,I got this for my son that does AC work... we live in the south and it‚Äôs really hot and humid here.  He really likes how it keeps him cooler.
5.0,Standing seven feet tall it was hard to find the extra extra long ties I needed. Problem solved! Beautiful tie and comes in lots of colors.
5.0,"The bra initially was lost by the post office, but the seller worked hard to<br />straighten everything out. I ordered a 34C instead of a 36B because it is front<br />closure and the fit around cannot be made tighter or more loose like regular bras.<br />The fit was perfect and I love the bra. Very comfy."
5.0,"Great product, exactly what I wanted. Arrived on time, used for a 2012 Buick Verano key"
5.0,Love it using it since the Day I got it!
5.0,Work great and make great gifts
5.0,A beautiful gift to our daughter Very good quality
5.0,These are just right for my puppy's collar.  They ring nice and clear every time she moves.  I always know where she is!
5.0,Good quality and construction-sizing perfect
5.0,They are very cute looking but I was disappointed by the size . I expected it to look as big as the photo but once you put it on they were tiny.
5.0,"Very nice compression socks, they fit me perfectly and are a great length. They are washing well."
5.0,Love them!!! Great value!!!
5.0,"Actually, these are good for summer and winter.  I borrowed a friends when going out for a summer hike and loved it.  I ordered 2 in different colors.<br />*They are cool enough to wear in summer for hot, sweaty hikes.  When the mornings start out chilly, these provide a soft layer that also doesn't get too hot.  I could keep it on to keep the sun off of my arms.<br />* They are a perfect cover for heading to the gym<br />* They wash beautifully and get softer after washings<br />* Very smooth texture keeps them from being scratchy<br />* Merino wool doesn't get funky with sweat the way polyester, nylon, or other synthetics do."
5.0,I wasn't sure about this purse but I get so many compliments.  It is very classy & functional.  High recommend this purse.  It is smaller than you think it might be but again very functional.
5.0,"I have had a hip replacement. That made it impossible for me to tie my shoes. The parts just don't bend that way anymore. I use these for both dress & casual shoes.  Very Helpful, and of good quality."
5.0,This is a great sweater at an affordable and fair price with a fit that was just perfect for me.
5.0,"I'm 5'4"" 118lbs.  32c and 25"" waist. I couldn't decide on xs or small based on reviews. I'm glad i got my usual xs. It is a snug fitting sweater which is what I wanted. Not too tight but body hugging and flattering. Size up if u want a looser fit. But I would say it fits true to size as does the other pattyboutik items I've gotten."
5.0,I can put many things in it. I love I can put my server book in it without having to hold it with the other hand.
5.0,Love this top! Haven't gotten to wear it yet but it fits perfectly. Highly recommended.
5.0,Bought 2 of these and my daughter's loved them. Comes with a cute box to store and a care sheet on how to care for it. Ill be buying more from this company cuz I lived everything from the boxingto the product
5.0,Good quality for the price and I received compliments all night long!
5.0,Perfect for the well dressed Mason.
5.0,"Fit better than expected, the  material is slightly strechy it mold to my curves very nicely, beautiful design on should as described on details."
5.0,"I may not have read the description properly, great item, at great price, but I wanted 3 blue pair, I received 1 blue, 1 black, 1 white."
5.0,Me encanto y me quedo a mi medida
5.0,"good deal, very happy with"
5.0,My daughter loves them and they don't cause her any irritation
5.0,My 7 year old daughter loveeeees these
5.0,Made a wonderful mother‚Äôs day gift. She loved it.
5.0,Adjustable and cute
5.0,The color is dazzling.  The beads are prefectly placed.  The weight keeps it in place and looked amazing.  I was the flapper of the night.
5.0,Very cute!!! I ordered xl based on reviews and glad I did. It does run small but SUPER CUTE!!! Light and comfy!! I can wear as a dress or with leggings. Love
5.0,Just the right color green
5.0,Hot bikini
5.0,Really like the colors and fit of this shirt!
5.0,Love these! Very comfortable and the color is really cute! Def would re order in a different color!
5.0,"Just wore these to the mountain last weekend.  They kept me warm but not sweaty.  They fit perfectly, even a little snug around the waistline for tummy control.  I am 5'6 and 145 lbs.  I carry my weight around the middle and these fit great."
5.0,for the price its perfect
5.0,"nice, cute colors ...."
5.0,"Material feels heavenly, so good against the skin. It is such a beautiful looking shirt as well. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase other prints or solids. A nice perk is the doubling of fabric on the back is great for my mom's old bones. Price stupendous!"
5.0,"Nothing fancy. Made simply, easy to read. Wxactly what it says it is."
5.0,"This watch is simply stunning with the Rose Gold watch against the Beige leather strap.  And to dress it up even more you can easily change bands.  I was skeptical because of the price, but to my surprise it is beautiful.  The drawback is it is not waterproof, so I'll have to remember that when I'm running in and out of the rain. But for the price, you can't go wrong!"
5.0,Muy acord√© para m√≠ bb
5.0,"Jewelry is really cute, well made and have already received compliments on it!"
5.0,I love my bracelet. It's classy & casual.  It goes with a t-shirt and jeans and then I can wear it with a nice dress and heels. No one would know it's a ponytail holder. I've gotten lots of compliments and it's super comfortable & stylish. I would recommend it to any girl. I'll be getting these as gifts for all my girlfriends.
5.0,"They went out to the homeless, thanks for them."
5.0,Fits good. Looks great. Love it
5.0,Great readers. I like that they can hang around the neck. My girlfriend told me of them. Pass it on!
5.0,"OK,so I bought this as a throw away (theft) wallet to use in Europe to keep the pick pockets from stealing my real wallet. The problem was that once I returned to the U.S. I like this wallet better than my expensive Tumi wallet. The Tumi now sits in a dresser drawer."
5.0,I love this dress.  I'm a nursing mom and although this dress is not a nursing dress I cute off the collar and it is wonderful to nurse in. When you cut the neck off it makes it look like a boat neck and is very stretchy to nurse in.
5.0,Good deal and is exactly what is advertised
5.0,Everything was fine.
5.0,"These are the best ones I've found.<br /><br />Unlike the others, these have real nose cushions, not a rubber pad on a stick. That's what the others look like"
5.0,"These look awesome on! Very retro and chic. The materials used in the glasses makes them seem a lot more expensive than they are, and the case they came in is solid and durable. A great buy!"
5.0,Nice for winter. Great pricing.
5.0,It's perfect!
5.0,"I was determined to find a solid colored band for my Fitbit versa and wanted to try this out since it had the quick release pin. It fits fine except for the fact that the pin inside was slightly too short, but this was not a problem for me since I had a metal band that had pins that could be easily taken out. The pin cutout for the versa is also on the opposite side of the band pin, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a problem in terms of staying ability and comfort. Will update this review if it becomes a problem!"
5.0,"The the tags, really bright color, lots of space to write, and like the wire to hook it to the luggage. If<br />I need any more I would for sure but from them again"
5.0,Great GIFT.
5.0,Fast Delivery. Good wallet. Everything fits perfect.
5.0,"I was shocked when I saw the price of these glasses but I was even more shocked when they arrived.  These glasses are amazing and I'm so glad that I stumbled across them and bought several pair (black, brown and black/pink).  I plan to buy another pair soon...I love sunglasses!!!"
5.0,Couldn't wear it. Have it to my 11 year old daughter to wear. She's a size 10-12 and it's an XL.
5.0,"We love them they look so fierce,she says they are very comfortable and. Goes great with any uniform"
5.0,love it...going to order another print of this dress tonight!  Very cute.
5.0,Just PERFECT!!!!
5.0,This necklace and earring set is wonderful! I get so many compliments wearing them! Definitely a must have!!
5.0,bought this for the kids and it fit perfect on them. love the colors and the material was not too hot you couldnt breath when you had it on. would highly recommend for kids
5.0,"Couldn‚Äôt be happier with the quality and fit, especially for the price. It‚Äôll need to steamed before wearing, but I plan To put it In a<br />dry cleaning bag and Throw it In The dryer before my trip. And then hang in bathroom at hotel with shower on and spray with ‚Äúwrinkle out.‚Äù I got this for a Conference with special cocktail events at night I got a small and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, 128 pounds and a 36DD. The fit is very tight and extremely flattering, just the way I wanted it. For those that like a loser more relaxed fit I‚Äôm sure sizing up could be an option, but I‚Äôd be concerned about the bodice staying up since it a shoulder dress, and has lace on The top. I‚Äôm wearing this with a crinoline petticoat underneath. But also plan to wear without the skirt for different occasions or different looks. Love it. Hope my review helps your decision."
5.0,Feel comfortable
5.0,"Great casual top.  Fabric is rather thin and you can &#34;somewhat&#34; see through it, but not so much that it would require you to wear a cami or something underneath.  Fits well, has a nice cut to it so its not overly boxy.  Love it"
5.0,Received a ton of compliments! Well worth the money!
5.0,"Very versatile!  I have 4 of these dresses now and I wear them out on dates, to church, casual gatherings, etc.  they go well with boots, flats, and heels!  I probably will own ALL the colors eventually.  And they wash well and keep their shape!  Great value!!!"
5.0,"I have a problem with my socks sliding off in my winter boots. I folded these ones half way down for comfort as I have large calves. I didnt have one problem with them. The material is thinner than I expected, but they are comfortable."
5.0,"Looks exactly like on the picture! I sized up first based on the comments and ordered M, but had to return it for S, which fits perfectly! I am 5'11'' and 143 lbs. The dress is stretchy and very comfortable. I wish it would be a bit longer as it slides up a bit during walking."
5.0,Easy to use. Cleans great without hands getting wet.
5.0,"[[ASIN:B00IDHFKF2 90 Degree By Reflex Yoga Capris - Yoga Capris for Women - Hidden Pocket, large, Black]]<br />I love all of the 90 Degree by Reflex yoga pants. They always fit as expected and have so many unique patterns and colors. I've gained a few pounds over the last few months, hence my need for the pants so I can start working out again, but I still like to think I weigh less than I do so the large was snug (I'm 5'5, 170 lbs), but still fit and was not see through like some of the other reviews claim them to be.<br /><br />I actually have purchased 3 pairs of these in black. After several hundreds of washes, they start to pill and the seams start to fray, however I will be the first to admit I don't launder them appropriately and they get A LOT of use. So they are wearing as expected for the amount of use they get. I don't only wear them to work out, I wear them as leggings with nice tops too. That might be weird, but whatever."
5.0,"I have been going to a gym for over 20 years now.  I have always been &#34;ok&#34; with my duffle bag that I sling over my shoulder each day I that I enter the locker room.  I have always just thrown my gym shoes, shirt, pants, boxers, iPad, iTouch, etc. into the main compartment of my bag and have been fine with that.<br /><br />I switched gyms recently and the lockers were a little bit smaller than I was used to.  I often found myself having to take my bag in and out of the locker before working out, after working out, before showering, changing into clean clothes, and packing up to leave.  Needless to say it was simple but annoying process.<br /><br />I went onto Amazon to find a solution.  I searched for &#34;gym locker bag&#34; and the Glo Bag was one of the first results.  At a price of $100 I was in a bit of &#34;sticker shock&#34; but thought &#34;what the Hell?&#34; and purchased the item anyway to try it out.  Worst case scenario I would return it.<br /><br />The bag arrived a few days later and I transferred everything in my current gym bag to the Glo Bag.  Everything had a place and I felt more organized for the gym than I did in my home or work life.  When I got to the gym, my locker room experience was altered in a way that is hard to explain.  It sounds SO ridiculous to be so excited about something as simple as an improved &#34;locker room&#34; experience but I truly was.<br /><br />I felt like I was at home dealing with my own closet (in a good way) as I hung my Glo Bag in the locker and put away my keys, cell phone and glasses, then changed into my gym clothes and when leaving the gym applied deodorant and foot powder and put back on my &#34;work&#34; clothes.<br /><br />It is really hard to make a &#34;backpack&#34; sound cool.  It is even harder to make it sound &#34;cool&#34; enough and &#34;functional&#34; enough to write a positive review about it.  But I think this product is amazing.  I have not been paid, nor am I related in ANY WAY to the seller...I am just impressed by what I received.<br /><br />As a side-note...in case you are worried...the construction of the bag is excellent.  I am not an expert on the subject matter, but the zippers seems to be something you would find on an arctic expedition (very strong and solid) and the rest of the construction is superior to any bag I own (it resembles the quality you would expect from a good piece of luggage).<br /><br />Once again, I have ZERO prior experience with this company and am writing this review only because I am so happy with the product."
5.0,Looks just like pic on my 5yo girl.  Delivery took long but was in contact with seller. Great winter purchase!
5.0,"Just what I was hoping for - it's elegant, warm, a lovely weight & drape. Will compliment nearly every outfit from sweater & jeans to evening dress for the symphony.  I plan on wearing it on the plane whenever I fly for extra warmth.  Would make a great gift!"
5.0,Good quality & true to size
5.0,New favorite shorts
5.0,I liked it so much I bought two of them One of them I modified to use on my jacket for the zipper in the front looks great love it
5.0,My bf is a construction worker and he works outside in the most harsh conditions. This hoodie keeps him super warm and he doesn't even have to layer up.
5.0,"I want 80 more of these in all the different colors. In fact, I did order another one! Each one fits differently so be careful with sizing. This one is longer and thicker but I got the dark blue long sleeve one and it was a couple inches shorter and thinner."
5.0,Wash and wear. Comfortable
5.0,Very simple and light weight.  Design is cute. Great for my steampunk costume.
5.0,Love it! Plenty of compliments. Brought it for a Birthday Tea Party üíô
5.0,I purchased and returned several hats looking for just the right one to wear to a winter wedding. I purchased a very similar one for almost twice the price and returned it (too small and came in squashed condition). THIS ONE is a similar but nicer hat and slightly larger to fit my head for almost half the price.  Came slightly misshapen in box but easy molded to perfect shape.
5.0,Everybody needs these belts. I ordered several for Christmas gifts<br />Perfect for those bothered by buckles  and sensitive belly issues
5.0,"This dress is great for traveling. Good quality, better than expected.  It doesn‚Äôt wrinkle much. I highly recommend this product."
5.0,Very pretty. The material is light weight and comfortable.
5.0,Great product please buy
5.0,"I love this dress for my 8-year-old, it fits her just right and she looks great in it. She was excited about it and loves wearing it. She says it's pretty comfortable and when I felt the material, it felt soft and comfy. It's lightweight, breezy, and perfect and easy to maintain with washing and caring for it!<br />If you're looking for a cute, fab dress for your kid(s), then you should definitely check this one out!"
5.0,exactly as pictured.
5.0,"These jeans are so cute! First, I bought the red floral ones...I bought a size medium. I am 5'8"", 133 lbs. I wish that they fit a little tighter, but they look good with a belt. I loved them so much that I bought 3 more styles."
5.0,"They actually stay on! Have not come off once when my child is crawling around. I will be buying more for sure. I do wish the no-skid part was a little more rubbery. The stars don't seem like they have as much traction as other no skid things I've owned . That's the toss up, super great staying on the feet but not as slip resistant. I feel like other brands may have more slip resistant coating on the bottom but don't stay on as well. But as far as staying on the feet they get 5 stars for sure."
5.0,"I recommend this product but take care with it, it may get full of lint easily."
5.0,Nicer than I expected. They are mostly a soft pink in color. They will look very nice in the summer with casual clothes. They are not flawless and don‚Äôt look like they cost thousands of dollars.... but they are pretty and will pull together a outfit for put together look.
5.0,"Super soft material, love the pockets!  This is my favorite dress to change into when I want to be relaxed but not in sweats."
5.0,So so cute and perfect
5.0,"Great quality sweatshirt.  Well made, not cheap.  Fun holiday humor.  Love it!"
5.0,Beautiful and comfortable top!
5.0,Fit  Perfect
5.0,Glasses were as promised. Great quality for the price. Very stylish
5.0,Just as described and I‚Äôm very happy with the product. No complaints only praise!
5.0,Love this watch
5.0,"Love, love, love these sunglasses!"
5.0,Excellent product. Fit as expected. Comfortable.
5.0,"I was actually surprised that these boots fit perfect. I usually have to get wide width but it wasn‚Äôt available. However, I didn‚Äôt need it with these boots. I love the quality and style!"
5.0,Our son loves this shirt...I ordered a little big for growing room and it's perfect!
5.0,fits good.
5.0,"The fabric was perfect! I wore it out for a vacation and it easily became my favorite piece I took! Fabric was great quality, the fit perfect and the sas as you walk....spot on!! Definitely will purchase in different colors."
5.0,"I love these glasses. They fit great, very comfortable. The tint is not too dark, obscuring light which can be dangerous and I do not feel my eyes strained. As a matter a fact, it gives you a nice crisp look at your surroundings, but still provides shade from the harsh sun. I receive a lot of compliments and I highly recommend these glasses. I am buying another pair!!<br /><br />-Meech13"
5.0,now get out of here so so cute
5.0,Very cute and a good value!!! would definately recommend. Purchased as part of a baby gift. Hope they enjoy it!!
5.0,I love everything about my hat !
5.0,"This whatch is really nice, trendy, fashion!!...i love the  white color!!...i really like it.. There are so many puma watches that i love!!"
5.0,"so, these are soft but sturdy enough to keep your glasses in place. It is pretty cool how easy they are to put on the frame and how easily they can be moved around to keep glasses in place. They arrived quick - love them and think you will too if drooping glasses bug you too!"
5.0,"The handbag arrived on time. Color, design and size are exactly the same as displayed. The customer service at Katloo is great! They make sure you are completely satisfied with your product.<br /><br />It is a cute little handbag come cross body purse that you can use it with a casual wear.  It is comfortable and I love it!"
5.0,"Easy to get on and off, the material its made of is silky smooth, comfortable on my wrist, so far very resistant, haven't noticed any scuffs or marks on mine yet, it gets heavy wear, i have it on almost every day, will definitely buy more colors."
5.0,This was perfect for me and my 5 year old son to play as space gunfighters and dress up in cardboard mech-suits.
5.0,Got this for my mom for her birthday - she loved it.
5.0,"I really like the fit, especially around the waist....it seems to hide it. My husband, Eric, gave me lots of compliments!"
5.0,awesome shirt. feels nice. fits great. like the shape and length
5.0,"This arrived today after being ordered sometime ago. If you are wanting quick shipping this isn't going to happen, not unless you pay for it. It was nicely packaged and neatly folded in the packaging. Upon opening it, the product is nice and soft and more thin fabric than one might think, but not see through. It is also very black and not a faded black color. The seams are all straight and it is well made. I cannot seem to find a tag for how to wash it safely, so either it's an oversight or the company doesn't put one in it. I washed mine on delicate so I suggest that putting it on a gentle cycle would be the best thing to do. It comes with a belt that at first glance looks huge, but once I put it on it was perfect with plenty of options to fit people at several different sizes. I really like this pant suit, I have never had one before. The only thing I wish was different, is that it the legs are incredibly long, it fits the way it is supposed to but the length is insanely long. I am not sure if heels would help or if I am going to have to have that fixed. Either way, I am very pleased with this product and it is very nice.<br /><br />I am blessed to have received this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion."
5.0,My son love it! Very vibrant doesn‚Äôt bleed much fits my 6yr who wears 6-7 in boys
5.0,"Love this, fit, color, good purchase...co fortable"
5.0,"Compr√© cinco pulseras, pero a los pocos d√≠as de uso, se les cay√≥ la letra y despu√©s se les fue da√±ando el color plata"
5.0,"Beautiful bright dress, with the perfect vintage look! I got a size small and it fits wonderfully. I have a 34‚Äù bust and 27‚Äù waist and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚ÄùI was worried that the small would be too big based on their size chart but it was perfect."
5.0,This went great with my off the shoulder dress
5.0,"These feel well made, they fit very well, are very comfy and SUPER cute!"
5.0,"I love it! Very comfortable for my body type, I'm very curvy so small belly rings don't stand out and bigger ones hurt, this one is perfect :)"
5.0,My Girl Loved them! good Fit and nice colors!
5.0,Excelente comodidad
5.0,"Finally found a pair of sun glasses with lenses dark enough to make seeing in the summer in Arizona pleasurable.  Also, great fit and nice frames."
5.0,The holders are of excellent quality.  The rubber locks in on the earpiece and holds nicely.  Thanks.
5.0,Love It for storage
5.0,"Per previous reviews the chain is very thin. The jade is nice size and angel is very shiny. Also loop that holds the jade in the back, is good size and you can easily replace with larger chain. Nice pretty red."
5.0,Very Cute.
5.0,This is really beautiful.  I have it to my tween daughter for Valentine's Day today and told her that we want her to look at this and remember to never settle for less than she deserves. (Because the stone looks like a large diamond)
5.0,Best fitting bra I have owned
5.0,My favorite workout pants.  Have had them several months and use several times a week.  Keep me dry and stand up to a llt of washing!
5.0,"Purchased this for my 14 year old daughter. She is 5'4"" 140 pounds and we went with a size Large. It fits her great, good material, looks nice."
5.0,"If you're busty like I am, this is not a great fit. 2 years ago I ordered 2, which fit me perfectly. I have lost weight, so expected the size to work. I am 5'2"" 135 36DDD. The length is perfect, the fabric is nice and not at all see thru, but the chest area is small, it puckers in the back.  I had to send back 2 that I ordered. Also, the blue floral is a muted blue not a royal blue. The spotted one is orange not red, and that isn't very flattering to my skin tone. Returned the both of them, but did order and keep another floral one."
5.0,Super handy bag for male or female. A beautiful shade of  blue.  The bag is airy and keeps things organized and dry. The cooler is perfect for a few sandwiches drinks and snacks perfect for beach or any outing.
5.0,Beautiful piece! I love the product
5.0,Love the fit of this dress. Got a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,"From my wife, Super cute and well made, fabric a little stretchy and comfortable"
5.0,Stunning dress!! Fits perfectly. A little long so heals need to be worn although I wore flats since I was having a party on my lawn
5.0,I really like the Teal color and the band stays attached to my fitbit better then the  band that came with my fitbit.
5.0,Really great sweatshirt!
5.0,"I just loved. Fit as expected,"
5.0,We had a hat that was 0-12 months and it had little to no stretch for my big 8 month old so I ordered these hats and they‚Äôre super cute stretchy and warm! The only issue is he‚Äôs a busy guy who has no time for a hat ü§£
5.0,"A bit on the large side, but arrives packed like a gift. Very cool! Comes with tools to shorten or add punched holes. I love it!"
5.0,"Bought this for my 9-year old grandson.  He loved it.  Would have been nice to have an extra pocket on it, but it will do what he needs it to do.<br />Graphics were good, quality was good.  Overall I was very pleased with the purchase."
5.0,They are very comfortable and fun.
5.0,"Purchased for a friend / owner of a boat, and she loved it!"
5.0,Ordered an XL I'm 6 foot tall and abouy 150 lbs. But always order up in size for length  yhe wrap  skirt split isnt bad when standing still but fould become revealing when moving so I'm going to add a tack stich and probably a thicker slip layer. The strechy part at the top is big on me but for and extra large is perfect. I didn't find the arms to be to small either like some other reviews suggested.
5.0,The earrings are beautiful.  The bar across the stone adds to the beauty of the earrings.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
5.0,I‚Äôm not crazy about the color but it isn‚Äôt for me! It will go in the Christmas Store at the Veterans Home.
5.0,Love the hair very cute
5.0,Excellent quality. I love it.
5.0,bought these for my husband who seems to go through a band a month and he is still wearing the first one from the set of three he likes the versatility in being able to switch the bands out. SOOOOO worth it and although inexpensive not cheap.
5.0,Fit was right quality was excellant
5.0,I‚Äôm so surprised to see so many bad reviews! This is my favorite bra! It is super comfortable! You may need to size up JUST A LITTLE.
5.0,Fits all if you‚Äôre short.  If I could shrink by 3‚Äù I could have easily walked into it.  At 5‚Äô11‚Äù the seam for the helmet took a slight stretch.  I was able to walk around and it makes quite a great sauna suit.  I recommend investing in a 2nd cooling fan to survive more than 15-20 mins in the suit.  I also worry about CO buildup in the suit as the faceplate fogged up and I saw no way for CO to escape.
5.0,Super products
5.0,"If you believe in spirituality and wish to show the world proudly, this bracelet is a necessity....Very well made, fits fantastic.  Show your beliefs with pride and style."
5.0,I really loved my old band but the strap keeper broke and I was afraid I would lose my watch.  I did not find another band I liked and I ordered these and it was SO EASY to put on.. Such a life saver.<br /><br />A good buy.  Would definitely recommend.
5.0,Very nice Christmas earrings. Great conversation pieces. Would recommend them to anyone.
5.0,The cap arrived so quickly and was nicely packaged. I was really impressed with the quality of  the cap as well as the way it fit! Love the button feature too!
5.0,I love these glasses! They're exactly as described and the lenses are mirrored with an awesome gold-ish color. I have a little wider face so many women's styles are too narrow for me. These fit perfect and look great.
5.0,Love these compression socks  No swelling when I used them on a long road trip.
5.0,"Love this jacket. Protects from wind and rain. If I need to find an issue, the pockets are a bit high (at least for me)."
5.0,"Very nice bracelets! I think this is the 2nd review I‚Äôve posted but keep getting emails saying I didn‚Äôt rate. The bracelets are very nice & well made, the set has 12 bracelets but only 4 inspirational quotes so you will get 3 of the same bracelet in each set. I like to wear 2 & when someone notices & comments how much they love the inspirational quote, I take one off my wrist & put it on theirs. Was thinking instead of those painted rocks people have been hiding, these bracelets would‚Äôve been a much better idea, who wouldn‚Äôt like to find a bracelet to wear or share instead of a rock?"
5.0,I like the way it's hugs the curves
5.0,"Great color, great fit, nice quality. Will buy again in other colors."
5.0,Amazing pants
5.0,Very fast shipping! As expected!
5.0,"I love these, they are lightweight, soft and cheery! The only think i dislike is that they are a bit too small. Of course, I'm hardly a petite woman, so they will probably be a perfect size for most ladies. But just a warning, they are smaller than the average hankie. That also makes them ineligible (imho) for use as a pocket square."
5.0,Really love this swimwear. Fit as expected
5.0,I love these bras. Very comfy.
5.0,very good slippers. has great sole for indoor/outdoor wear.
5.0,"Bought the red in XXL - glad I went a size up because it fits perfectly.<br /><br />It just covers my bum, but not enough for me to feel comfortable wearing it with just leggings, so I wore a long open front sweater with it.  Looked cute like that."
5.0,The bracket was beautiful just the wrong size
5.0,"I love these rings! I purchased these to wear to the gym and during outdoor activities since I have broken my engagement ring twice. These were exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Fit: 10/10 I couldn't remember the exact size of my finger so I took a ruler and measured the inside of my engagement ring and used the chart to order and the fit was spot-on.<br /><br />Comfort: 10/10 The rings are a silicone-type of material and they are soft and comfortable. I was a little bit worried that the ring would rub or be uncomfortable when I lifted weights but the ring didn't bother me at all-- I hardly noticed it was on!<br /><br />Style: 9/10 I really like the color of the blue and black rings. The pink and purple are a little bit &#34;girly&#34; and bright for me but I imagine that if you regularly wear pink and purple colors, you will like it. I also wish the band was a tiny bit thinner- but I really like super thin bands. I've attached pictures so you can see the colors and fit a little bit better.<br /><br />Price: 10/10 These are an awesome value- even if I only wear two out of the four rings. They seem very comparable to the competitor brand.<br /><br />Shipping: 10/10 I ordered the rings on Friday and they arrived Sunday!<br /><br />If you are looking for a good set of rings for your active lifestyle, these are great! I choose to review these rings and in return, I received a discount off of my order. I hope the review was helpful!"
5.0,"My son was so happy to receive this safe bag that is perfect for walking and exploring with the family. This safe lock shoulder bag keeps your valuables secure while you enjoy the day , whatever you do."
5.0,I am so happy it came.
5.0,I found this watch for a song!!! It was everything it said it was. I have to shake my head sometimes in disbelief that I can buy a watch this nice for under ten dollars !!!
5.0,"A tad big now; but, when the weather warms, it will allow room for growth over the summer. Very well made."
5.0,I'm 6'3 and weight 305 lbs and the 3x fit perfect
5.0,I liked them a lot<br />Very comfortable
5.0,"PERSONAL ""BUSINESS"" CARDS"
5.0,"Haven‚Äôt wore the dress yet, but loved it when I tried it on. I am 5‚Äô1‚Äù 110 lbs so purchased a small. Fits great and is perfect length for flat sandals. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it!"
5.0,My wife loves it. Decent quality for the money!
5.0,I was a sceptic for the price. The weight and quality is perfect. My fianc√© and I are having a very simple wedding and wanted something I can wear again. And this dress I will definitely wear again. Fit is perfect. I bought Large D cup 160 lbs and fits great. I bought a rhinestone belt to wear with it for wedding in Ivory color and it‚Äôs is more than expected. Love it
5.0,"I bought this to wear out with my in-laws. You definitely need to wear a low cut strapless bra due to the very skinny straps and plunging neckline. I actually used a tiny safety pin to make it a little less revealing, but the dress is still beautiful. I love how it's tight on top and flares out in the hips and butt (I'm bottom heavy).<br /><br />I bought this in a size 6 and I thought it fit perfectly (I'm 5'7&#34;and 150ish lbs). The length fell slightly below my knee and looked great with some sandals. I will most likely buy this again in white because it's so flattering :)"
5.0,She like it but broken
5.0,These are great for adults with small faces as well! They are so cute and perfect
5.0,"Lately I've gotten really interested in the NuGoth look. (With apologies to our central pillar of traditionalists, I love everything from old school goth to cybergoth, and the NuGoth twist we're seeing in the last couple of years is just the best, most versatile, casual yet polished variation of goth fashion in at least a decade.) This bag absolutely epitomizes that look, with the combination of geometry, esoteric/occult symbols, and striking, white graphics.<br /><br />It's faux/vegan leather and feels quite durable. The strap is a strong woven material, and it's both removable and adjustable from cross-body to shoulder. There's a single handle if you prefer to carry it like a case. The size is generous but not ridiculous. I can fit everything from my Big Purse in this one once I remove the organizers I usually use. There's a back pocket (just a little too small for most phones, sadly) and a little organization inside, but mostly this is a toss-it-all-in-the-middle sort of purse. (And obviously the shape doesn't work well with removable organizers.) It opens across the top about, oh, forty percent of the bag's overall circumference, so it's easy to access your contents.<br /><br />So the shape and the organization might be a touch challenging, but overall this is a very useful, practical purse that would go well with just about any goth look, especially NuGoth. It's a bit oversized for a club purse, but if you've got the confidence, this could easily be your everyday handbag."
5.0,Cute comfy slides. My baby likes them. They are an EXACT fit so go a size bigger.
5.0,The watch is exactly what I needed and for those of you complaining it's an inexpensive watch you want artsy fartsy pay more for one otherwise keep you negative reviews to yourself
5.0,"Children‚Äôs size fits as expected, adult sizes do not. Way too small. But granddaughter loves hers."
5.0,"This is an absolutely gorgeous tie, and pretty well made.  Well worth the price."
5.0,I'm very impressed with this band it's soft and feels good on the wrist. It seems very solid I think it's gonna last a very long time. It's also very easy to put on and you can't beat the price. The band does get a little more dirty than the original band but everything wipes right off so it's not a problem. The band is very solid and I don't think I'm going to have the stretching problems I had with the original band. overall I'm very pleased and would definitely buy this band again.
5.0,Nice sweat band
5.0,"I love how long it is. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and finding dresses that are really long is hard. I have bought this dress in six different colors and always get compliments when I wear them. Fit is great, very true to size."
5.0,"I bought them for my 9-years old son and he wears them constantly for basketball practice as well as his little bike errands. After more than a month, they still look like new with just some cleaning. I would buy them again."
5.0,"This charm is very cute, it‚Äôs very small though. But I guess for a Pandora bracelet it‚Äôs the perfect size. My mom loves it, so it‚Äôs a win on my end. But it‚Äôs exactly as pictured & comes in a cute little bag & box."
5.0,just what I wanted.
5.0,Love these sunglasses sturdy and so cute! Great price! I ordered multiples after I received my first one Haha
5.0,Love love them I get so many complements when I wear them. Very happy with them.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! We use them as bracelets for my 2 year old. She loves them and the color variety is great for all her outfits.
5.0,I like them the best of the shoulder pads I have tried.  I hope they will remain in stock so I can continue to buy them in future.
5.0,Liked the fitting
5.0,Works great but be aware that it is sent from Asia and takes a looooonnnnnngggg time to get here.
5.0,"This belt is definitely a dupe for Valentino but it‚Äôs definitely a baby Valentino belt because the v is maybe 1 1/2-2 inches in size, it went back.<br />It will be cute on a petit frame but I‚Äôm to big for such a small belt it will get lost on my waist."
5.0,Like the solid feel to them. Not made of cheap plastic like others I've seen.
5.0,"We're huge Jurassic World fans so when I saw this, I had to get it for my 5 year old son. The noise feature is so much fun. It's also made well and the graphics are great. I went up in size so it would last but it does seem to run a little large, so keep that in mind."
5.0,they last about 3 months with regular use.
5.0,Pretty cool belt to have...
5.0,These are precious
5.0,"My husband liked the gloves a lot. He stated they kept his hands super warm while we were in the snow. He did note that they did not get wet, even when his gloves were in melting snow (basically water puddles). He said they were a little more bulky than he would prefer but for the cost of the gloves, he was super happy with them. As a bonus, they have zippered pockets (for storage of essentials like a car key I‚Äôm assuming). All in all, they are awesome for the price."
5.0,Love these light weight stretchy super comfy shorts we live in the country im always looking for cute jean shorts that don't cost a lot they get dirty love these buying more colors
5.0,"Fun item,  my wife wears it not me,  but she really likes it.  Seems it will get better with wear."
5.0,These gloves are as advertised.  Fit nicely and as expected.  Seem to be made of good quality and look good as well.  Nice and warm too!
5.0,Totally in love
5.0,Love this little belt. And fit was perfect!
5.0,"one of my friends RAVES about Lively.  i had tried one of the bras once, but wasnt totally sold.  i hadn't really decided to give their loungewear or workout gear a chance, honestly because i typically just dont spend that much on leggings.  i get it now.  i really get it.  these pants feel phenomenal!  they are so buttery soft, but also almost feel activie.  when i put them on i actually want to be active.  they fit exactly as i expected.  they are a higher waist.  i would like about half an inch more so i can play at Top Golf in them a little better but for the most part i have no issues with roll down or any type of unwanted movement.  and there is a tiny little pocket in the waistband for smaller items.  there are no pockets on the legs, for which i am grateful!  i am not a fan of that look and it seems to be on most leggings these days so i regularly look for options without the visible pockets.<br /><br />i absolutely love these leggings, like so much i want even let the cat sit on them for fear that he's going pull on them.  they never even get 'put away because once they are clean, they are getting worn."
5.0,"This is a heavy duty mask, not a cheap plastic one.  I liked it"
5.0,replaces my former watch like this
5.0,"Nice shoe fit as expected Oder me size 7  heels is not to high just average perfect for walking & for the upcoming gatsby party I‚Äôm going comfortable to walk,no complain her."
5.0,"Some of the most comfortable safety shoes I have ever owned and the grips on the sole of the shoe work better than i want them to. No complaints, great purchase. Caution, they are well insulated so I wouldn't  recommend them for summer or warm weather use."
5.0,Don't hesitate. But this wallet! I bought it for my trip to Africa and it kept me super organized. Plenty of pockets for everything plus coin holder and pen holder. My friend complimented it and I told her the price and that I got it from Amazon. She was shocked and said it looked expensive. The red is a beautiful color and I'm glad I got that instead of black like I normally would. You won't regret this purchase!
5.0,"Awesome hiking cap. Folds up so you can stash it in a coat pocket. Keeps your head pretty cool. I've got a melon-head and am always skeptical that even &#34;large&#34; and &#34;extra large&#34; hats will fit me, this thing is awesome in that respect. I ordered the extra large and it fits perfectly, doesn't deform or look goofy once it's on my giant dome. Highly recommend."
5.0,"excellent quality, nice to be pleasantly surprised!"
5.0,"the texture is very nice, I love having it as my cold weather hat, its just so appropriate"
5.0,"Comfort, stability and design"
5.0,"Beautiful,classy elegant bracelet that you can wear everyday with anything.Sturdy,secure clasp"
5.0,"This wrap is really nice and the colors are very pretty.  I'm a short plus sized woman and it fits me great, the longest section probably reaches almost to my knees but that's fine with me.  It did have a slightly strange odor when it arrived, but a quick trip through the washing machine alleviated most of it.  Also wanted to mention that the washing instructions say not to tumble dry.  I didn't chance it because I was afraid it would shrink! Overall I am very pleased."
5.0,Very fitting and comfy.
5.0,Nice material and fits good
5.0,I have gotten tons of compliments on this cute scarf. I bought it to wear to a USA soccer game. But would work well almost in any occasion. The colors are so bright and the texture is silky smooth. To my pleasant surprise it has stripes of more transparency and opaqueness.  I know that sounds weird and awkward but trust me just makes it look more expensive and luxurious.  love it!
5.0,"Bought this beauty for myself for Mother's Day . Not only did it arrive a week before it was supposed to, and it arrived very well protected, but is 10 times (at least) more beautiful than it looks in the pictures! Awesome !"
5.0,These are great bracelets!  We bought them for a class project and afterwards plan on giving them to students. Very well put together and bright vibrant colors.
5.0,Perfect for protecting our children's ears!
5.0,I got the pink and the color was flattering as was the fit. Perfect casual wear.
5.0,Send me to mars wearing this hat and I update!
5.0,Meets all expectations.
5.0,Very cute. Needs a strapless bra which is kind of a pain but worth it. I am going to order it in another color too!
5.0,So soft. Love the color. Purchased this as a gift for a friend's baby shower. She loved them.
5.0,Purchased for my daughter. Looks great.
5.0,"This blouse is pretty but fits small. After reading the reviews, I ordered 2 sizes up and it's a perfect fit. I wear large and 2x fits in this item."
5.0,"This purse is so unique and comfortable to carry. It‚Äôs a fluffy velvet material that is easy to clean. It‚Äôs a dupe of a designer brand and it‚Äôs very stylish. Big enough to carry wallet makeup phone , but yet small enough to still carry anywhere without feeling uncomfortable. It can be hand held but also comes with strap to carry as shoulder bag or crossbody. Such a versatile and lovely bag."
5.0,"I didn‚Äôt purchase these online but rather through my local Ross, and I‚Äôve had them for about a year strong though construction and they‚Äôve held they‚Äôre color and size, doesn‚Äôt shrink and almost wrinkle free out of the dryer. People from work are asking if I bought new jeans when they‚Äôre the same ones haha. Then they compliment and starting asking. If I can remember correctly I paid about 60 for two pairs, blue and grey. I‚Äôm I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing a couple pairs in the near future. This is the type of purchase on clothes for everyday work and casual wear that actually is worth more then you're paying. For reference I‚Äôm 6.2‚Äù 245 Im rocking a clean 40X32"
5.0,Absolutely stunning dress! Fits perfectly!
5.0,Great dresss ... was iffy about this one as many reviews said it came too long or too short . Mine was perfect. Was concerned as I have large breast (32dd) but was able to wear with no bra fit fell.
5.0,This hat honestly fits and feels better than the one i got in Disneyland. I love it to pieces and its so comfortable.
5.0,My mom likes the bracelet.  It doesn't look cheap.
5.0,Really good shoe. Fit as expected. Light and really nice.
5.0,It arrived today and I couldn't be happier can't wait to wear it to my next fraternity meeting. I already recommended it to a few brothers.
5.0,Simply wear on any occasion
5.0,A SET OF 2 EARRINGS CAME IN THE PACK.  ONE GREEN AND ONE BLUE.  WRAPPED IN A BOX WITH PURPLE SACK.  A NICE SET OF EARRINGS FOR ANY OCCASSION.
5.0,very beautyful my daughter loved it
5.0,Love this bag and an amazing savings fur such a high quality bag ..... Worth every penny !!!!
5.0,TINY TINY TINY SIZES
5.0,"I work contuction,needed somthing that breaths and keeps me warm,this fits the bill! If you really won,t it to work add pure SILK under ware under neath!"
5.0,Love these glasses! They are very hollywood in person. I have already gotten tons of compliments on them already.
5.0,My daughter loves it thanx
5.0,Very nice and looks just like the picture.
5.0,Fit amazingly! Just what I was looking for!
5.0,"I really like this watch band and have bought a couple more in other colors.  It's fun and looks great.  It's a little too long for me, but I've got an extremely skinny wrist, so can't fault the band for that."
5.0,My favorite dress belt in both black and brown.
5.0,"Well-made swim trunks for my baby, but I had to exchange for the larger size. My son is 27 inches and weighs 16 lbs 8 oz and the size 6-12 months just fit him with his swim diaper on. I could see him growing out of it within the next month or 2, so I opted for the larger size 1-2 yrs.<br />This size is a little too big on him right now, but I should be able to get some great use out of it for the next few months. The swim trunks are very well made .... great fabric and strong stitching, plus they are so cute! Wish it came with a rash guard top to match!"
5.0,"This handbag is adorable--love the canvas fabric design. It's a little too small for everyday use, but I didn't buy it for that. Sometimes I don't want to lug everything with me everywhere. This little handbag holds more than enough on the occasions that I want to carry something smaller."
5.0,Best wallet I have ever purchased. It is just right for me.
5.0,"This is a very flattering dress. I have very large hips, so it's usually a 50/50 shot of any dress actually looking so flattering and this is a good one. I expected it to be more like wannabe cotton polyester material, but its more like a thin Lycra, kind of like UnderArmor like material so some body types might want to take notice of this. Love the pockets. I'm 5'5"" and my biggest issue with floor-length sundresses is a lot of them don't reach the floor even remotely, ending 2-3"" above my ankle, but this is actually floor length! Great value for the money!"
5.0,"I like the fabric, very soft and stretchy. I also love the deep v-neck. Now, It is a little big. I ordered size S. I wish there would be size XS available. I changed the buttons to pearl color as the original ones give too much contrast for this nice, white fabric. The buttons just felt heavy more proper for the sweater. I also wish that it would be little shorter as I like shirts that don‚Äôt run passed my hips and I am very tall almost 6‚Äô."
5.0,Went up a size and it looks and fits great -- perfect for my active lifestyle ...
5.0,I love the dress... it's very sexy and lay really well...
5.0,Fun festive tank for a 4th of July half marathon. A little long but nothing some hemming tape and and iron couldn‚Äôt fix.
5.0,Git this gor my 14 yr ild son and it fits true to size. The colors and graphics were as shown.
5.0,Purchased for my daughter. It fits her perfectly and the material is great. Allows good air flow as well as coverage. The design itself is a great Ying Yang Concept.
5.0,Bought for Christmas for my daughter...she love it. Good quality product.
5.0,Favorite jacket!  Fit is excellent!
5.0,perfecting
5.0,"I love wearing boots of all kinds but when my pants what to ""blouse"" out of them it kinda ruins the look. These straps keep them secure where needed"
5.0,"I GOT THE RUST COLOR AND THEY ARE EXACTLY THE BRICK RED/RUST COLOR I NEEDED FOR MY NEW JEANS! NICE COMFORTABLE SOCKS, WASH AND WEAR WELL, COMFORTABLE- DON'T PINCH THE ANKLES. VERY PLEASED INDEED!!!"
5.0,This is beautiful. I love it.
5.0,Very cozy and gets lots of attention as soon as anyone sees them in my house.  A must have on a cold day.  My only complaint is that it stretches out pretty quick after wearing it to the point where it falls off my feet pretty easily....although I do wear them a lot
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my sister ‚Äî She loves it! It is well made (clean and clear magnification), not too heavy and looks like a nice piece of jewelry at a glance. Her middle aged and senior co-workers were also very impressed with it. Am definitely buying more for gifting other friends!"
5.0,A quality belt that is worth much more than I paid for it here on Amazon.  It fits perfectly and I will be able to wear it several ways.  Really dresses up a little black dress.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.  I absolutely love it!

5.0,"I like it, I need this Sox for my circulation. Since 3 years they are my company every work day. Thank you so much."

5.0,Love them! They are very very lightweight so not sure how durable they will end up being but so far I'm impressed! üëì
5.0,"These are just as cute as the picture, and they arrived quickly. I only say that they are a work in progress because I haven't quite figured out the captive bead thing yet, I'm still new at this. However, I can say that these are sturdy little earrings, and I can't wait to figure out how to put them on! Lol :-)"
5.0,"This shirt is so comfortable, wear it for work and just relaxing in. Color green was what I expected, size was too."
5.0,Great beginner pack for my tween.
5.0,Very nice watch for an unbelievable price. The solar energy makes it very versatile for those going to places where batteries are not readily available. Adjusting the time or date is very simple. I was able to do it without referring to instructions. Received many complements .
5.0,Great fit. Looked great on my husband. He wears XL in clothes for the length. This fit him perfectly.
5.0,"Very well made, and fits perfectly."
5.0,Fits as expected. My son loves it!

5.0,My 4year old daughter got so many compliments for this dress it fit perfectly and was very beautiful
5.0,This hat is just as good as the more expensive ones- my grandson received an expensive one for Christmas and I like this one better. It is light weight but warm enough for my walks with my dogs. Sound is good and it is much more comfortable than the ear buds. I am very pleased.
5.0,"got these as a gift and they are so loved.  You should have heard the squeal when they arrived.Nicely made and very cute.  Great for kids to hang on backpacks, gym/dance bags etc!"
5.0,"I have tried quite a few sports bras in my days--and I like this one...perfect for a yoga class--even hot yoga. It is nice to not have straps digging in my shoulders or feel like my ribs are being squeezed. I appreciate that the fabric is breathable (again, nice for hot yoga!)."
5.0,really cute earrings
5.0,"The leggings are perfect fit! the fabric is thick but streching. I love the side pockets to put my phones & cards when i go out. I'm 5'3'', 103lbs and I ordered size M, which was perfect size for me."
5.0,I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô3‚Äù but I have very short legs. This item was not extremely short when I wore it it was very classy looking. Well made and fit like a dream.<br />With this style and a snug waist line I ordered it in a size bigger than I normally wear and I‚Äôm glad I did because then it fit perfect.
5.0,"Great quality T-shirt. Soft and fitting, unlike other brands that are hard and stiff! My veteran loves this logo and I am so thrilled with the timeliness of the shipment arriving also! Thank you!"

5.0,Its beautiful I'm so excited to wear it.
5.0,"I love Verdusa dresses. The fabric is medium-thin, good for spring and fall. The fabric and the buttons are not the high-end quality, however, good for the price. Completely true to size. The style is elegant and sexy. I usually shop designer products, however, if you have problems like me finding the classic elegant styles, Verdusa is a great option."
5.0,Adorable and nice sized. I plan to wear them on my denim jacket. The quality exceeded my expectations. I am considering ordering a couple of sets to give as gifts.
5.0,I bought this key chain for my daughter starting at UMass Amherst in the fall. It is beautifully made and has a nice weight to it.
5.0,"This cooling scarf saved the day! I bought it to keep me cool while learning how to paddle a dragon boat (20 person rowing team) down a bayou in Houston, Texas in 85 degree heat. Everyone was feeling the heat except the two of us who wore the icy cold scarves we soaked in ice water. At the break (one hour) I changed my scarf for a fresh one I brought along in a container of ice water clearly marked as NOT for drinking. I would have been miserable without this scarf."
5.0,Love the coverage on all sides.
5.0,"This headwrap is the perfect size with very vibrant colors, it will not disappoint."

5.0,"Bought these little cuties for my 8 month old grandson. He's been wearing them everyday for 2 months and the toe paint/stain is beginning to wear off but, hey, he drags them around all day crawling on wood and carpet.  I'm pleased. The really good part is he can't pull them off and they certainly don't come off on their own. Good purchase."
5.0,Love My sandels
5.0,"This dress is very cute, especially for the money.  For reference, I'm 5'2, about 144 lbs, and wear a 36C.  This dress for very well everywhere, but is very long on me due to my height, which I'm fine with.  It's a little loose on my chest at a medium.  I like the material and it's comfortable, so I have no complaints.  I can wear it out or to work"
5.0,"So far I like it, surprisingly well made. I won this as a daily giveaway and didn't know what to expect."
5.0,exactly as expected---good product and good price!
5.0,I made sure I got a large per the reviews of getting a size larger than your regular size.Fits nice.
5.0,"I needed a pair of safety glasses with a bifocal for my outside yard work...i.e. mowing, edging, etc. I didn't want anything expensive or name brand. Bought these for $20 (2 pair)  with the thought that they'd probably be tossed in the garbage after a couple of uses. Not so! They are far better than I expected. What amazes me is that I actually seem to see better with them too and I'm not talking about the near vision through the add power of the bifocal, rather the distance. I'm an Optometrist by trade, so I know a few things regarding optics. Great fit, great vision, well protected from sunlight and foreign bodies.  Incredible value!"
5.0,"I wore this necklace to a wedding with a black and white dress. It added a nice bit of pop. I‚Äôve worn it multiple times since then too. It‚Äôs a good length - not too long, not too short. Seems like good quality too."
5.0,"These banded bouffant scrub caps are perfect. They are well made. Big enough for longer hair & I love how you can wear them in two different styles/ways. The sweatband is my favorite feature, because I sweat a lot. Now, I don't have to feel embarrassed about it because no one will see it as the headband is well cushioned. I definitely recommend this product."
5.0,I am pleased with bracelet.
5.0,Wore these for my wedding and received many compliments. They are just the right size and not heavy.
5.0,My brother had this watch awhile back and the band broke he was determined to find another! So glad we did! He loves it and the price made it even better!
5.0,I got this for my husband. The socks come in a very nice box. The colors were super vibrant and great quality. I will definitely be ordering more.
5.0,I got this dress as a lightning deal. I read the reviews and they said it ran big so i ordered a medium. I LOVE this dress. Ive received so many compliments. I ordered the black and will ve ordering the others as well!
5.0,I waited to review this product to see whether it tarnished and thus lost it's beauty as you tend to expect from jewelry that you didn't spend a lot of money on.  That is NOT the case with this product...it is still as beautiful as the day it was received and looks exactly as it is pictured.  Would recommend not only this product but the company I purchased it from as well as I received the product long before they said I should be expecting it.
5.0,Love this shirt!!! Didn‚Äôt realize it had pockets till I got it which makes it 100%better B lol<br />Pockets are not the best to hold things but to place your hands in. But incredibly comfortable and great for cool crisp nights!
5.0,It‚Äôs so sturdy and not cheap lookin at all. I love it would buy one in every color!
5.0,Very satisfied with my purchase! Will buy more!
5.0,beware of return policy on these. SUPER comfy tho
5.0,Love the fit and material (soft!) I haven't been able to wear yet with heat wave but seems like it will be a fav in my closet!
5.0,I hate swim suits. I saw this read the reviews and thought I‚Äôd try it out! I love it. Fit perfect. Skirt is long enough to cover all that should be covered. The top super comfortable and fits well. I love the zipper. It has a little flap that the zipper fits into so no one can pull the zipper down by mistake. And it has pockets. Cute! I may by another one!!!
5.0,I've been wearing these sunglasses consistently for a couple of months now. They are holding up like a champ. I bought a second pair (of similar style) at the same time but from another seller. The matte finish on that one started peeling after a just a few weeks (even though it had a higher rating than this one).<br /><br />I would definitely buy sunglasses of this particular brand again.
5.0,"This shirt is fantastic quality. It‚Äôs really soft, stretchy and very comfortable. It is a nice look with some high waisted pants. Absolutely love it!"
5.0,My 3 yr old loves them. They fit her perfectly
5.0,I always wear them
5.0,Perfect size for my passport and other cards.  Space for some cash too!
5.0,"Great Product, Great Quality"
5.0,This necklace is beyond adorable! I love it so much the detail is great! You can totally make out the pumpkin and flower!
5.0,My daughter loves these.
5.0,"The asymmetrical design definitely adds to the character. I thought it would look awkward at first, but doesn't look bad when it's actually worn. We used this at a photoshoot without any bottoms for that sexier look. The back side of the dress is more revealing than the front, as it's got a shorter edge. For a regular day out though, you may want to wear leggings with this. Black leggings and boots will work well. After the photoshoot, this was given as a gift to a mom who wore it with black leggings and high boots for a Sunday out, and I was told that style came out looking good!"
5.0,This was a very cute piece for my husband's hippy costume. Very bright and colorful and he's a big guy and it stretched nicely over his wrist.
5.0,Love them fit my 4 year old great!
5.0,Used these for my bridesmaids. They held up well and looked gorgeous!! Amazing jewelry for the affordable price!
5.0,"Good quality, durable and reuseable produce bags. 3 different sizes that are nice and strong and durable"
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I am a 36DD and only 5'0, it is so hard to find dresses that fit and flatter. My 4 and 8 yr old kept saying I looked so beautiful. I love the look of it on and I love the feel of it. It hits below the knee but it hugs where it should and there is stretch to this dress."
5.0,This top is so flattering. Every time I wear it I get complements. It perfect for summer as well as winter. After all the complements I got when I wore this top I ordered the light blue like it as well.
5.0,"I got these on an Amazon Deal of the Day and LOVE them.  They are so pretty!  I was afraid they would be really tiny and the color might be off but I was pleasantly surprised at their size and the color was true.  These would look great for a formal occasion, even a wedding, and you can't beat the price!"
5.0,"awesome on the wrist, feels strong"
5.0,The best pair I ever had üòçüôåüèæ
5.0,"very difficult clasp for a 8 yr old, and after I wrote a 3 star review they reached out immediately to make things right,  and they did.product is fantastic but customer service was like none other !AWESOME!!"
5.0,It did fit a bit small around my thighs and a little loose in the chest area but as long as I tie the straps tightly you cannot tell that it fits me loose. However overall it is a great swimsuits! It is very cute and for the price it is a great catch!!!
5.0,"The size, style and color"
5.0,El cargador funciono exactamente como deber√≠a
5.0,Todo me agrado
5.0,"I love my Apple Watch and I like the ability to swap out the band, but the Apple bands are very expensive. I'm always on the look out for a good quality, but inexpensive, band and this one hits both of those marks.  The fit is very good on my 40 mm series 5 watch and it's just as comfortable as the band that came with the watch. I read some reviews that said the buckle had problems, but not on mine.  It fits great, looks great, is comfortable and a great bargain.  I recommend this product."
5.0,"I have been piercing friends' ears for a while now, nonprofessionally, and I can't recommend these enough.  I had been doing it by hand for a while and it is actually really hard to do so, but when I got these the difference was instant, they gave me perfect stability and it is easily one of my best impulse purchases to date!"
5.0,Used it for my wedding. Very lovely
5.0,"Nice graphics, well made shirt."
5.0,"Perfect gift and they loved them, made well and beautiful design"
5.0,"I recently received this as a gift from my husband. We are new on the grandparent scene and are thoroughly enjoying it. This is a great hat, the letters have a little sparkle and it‚Äôs distressed. It‚Äôs well made, but not too heavy. It doesn‚Äôt give me headaches. I recommend"
5.0,I‚Äôm happy with my shirt
5.0,Love these for BJJ
5.0,"nice, sturdy"
5.0,I bought this because I have been a fan of the hulk since i was a child. I definitely am a hulk nerd and absolutely love this shirt.
5.0,"The material is very soft, stays in place, and the fit is awesome."
5.0,"For my daughter, fits nicely, good quality."
5.0,"I love it. But if your overweight, it‚Äôs unflattering. My favorite house dress, like a cute muumuu.<br /> I went with purple. üëçüèºüëçüèº<br />‚Ä¶a cute grape vacuuming and making cookies."
5.0,"I own over 30 watches, some expensive and some not so. I bought this watch because of it's ""gold"" face and band. I don't have one with both. It didn't disappoint. Its weight is quite substantial for an inexpensive watch. That says something for its quality too."
5.0,"This is an amazing product, I have been using it when I go watch my little brother play soccer. I put it under my sweater and turn it on. It keeps me warm the whole game."
5.0,Bought for my dad to keep his arm warm while getting medical procedure. The chair he sits in is under an AC vent and these help keep his exposed arm warm. A+
5.0,Very comfortable and the fit is perfect!
5.0,I love these glasses not only do I look cute but it really helps my eyes during drawing and gaming.
5.0,Great Hat.
5.0,The best comfortable leggings ever..
5.0,"love the long length, perfect fit, thank you"
5.0,Very good quality ! The size is perfect.
5.0,"The product was exactly as described - very happy with time for shipping, also."
5.0,They were perfect my commitment!<br />Adjustable clip back!<br /><br />Super ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5.0,Great replacement insole!
5.0,"Excellent soft comfortable, orthopedic insole, thank you"
5.0,Great pair of socks great compression
5.0,Pretty. Nice quality
5.0,Love it! It was the perfect Halloween costume!
5.0,"Love this dress!  I originally ordered a large but returned for a medium because the bust is a little bigger. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù, 170 lbs and an 8 or 10 in jeans."
5.0,"My wife absolutely adores this product. It was delivered promptly, and it was just as described."
5.0,"I bought this wallet when it first came out to match a purse my mother had. At the time we would share everything and anything, including our love for Coach Couture. I've had it for years, it's lasted amazingly (even better than the solid leather wallets). I recommend it for those that like name-brand designs, etc."
5.0,They are perfect.  Even prettier than on the screen.  Small and delicate.  Work real well with the necklace that I have.Just what I needed to  complete my outfit for our Grandson's summer wedding with a pale pink dress.
5.0,"Son needed the hat for his costume and this one is perfect.<br /><br />Very high quality hat for the money, very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Came really fast was due Oct 5-24 but came by Sept 21.Fits my 2014 Mazda6 fob. Made of great material. Slid right on, no gaps, fit nice and snug! Recommended!!"
5.0,deal
5.0,"I always worry about buying a swimsuit online, but this one is amazing. It fits so perfectly it‚Äôs impressive. Great buy."
5.0,Kid loves it. Huge Minecraft Fan. It has adjustable string. Its thin material tho. Nonetheless it s worn a lot
5.0,"Overall, the outfit is very comfortable and fits well. There are a few strings hanging but it's not a problem at all and can be fixed by cutting them off. It fit as expected and is very breathable (feels like what I expected an actual volleyball uniform to feel like).<br /><br />One thing I think is important to consider is that the shorts are kind of small. They are elastic so they stretch and fit me fine, but if I wear them for too long they can start to hurt. :)"
5.0,super cute! definitely worth it for $15!
5.0,Cosy washes up nicely
5.0,"Beautiful earrings. I plan on wearing themto a wedding, but they'd look great with jeans too!"
5.0,Great purchase happy I bought it
5.0,I was skeptical at first but the mask fits great thanks to the Velcro back. The microphone has a switch for off and on and a volume sensitivity dial to control the amount of noise needed. The mask lights up to music or just breathing if you set to max. I've had hundreds of people ask me about it. The only complaint I would have is it's 1 color only. If they put a color button it would improve my opinion. The electronic part of the mask is removable so you can wash the fabric.
5.0,"Dainty, very attractive. Arrived timely"
5.0,Very comfortable and flattering! I wish they had one in every color!!
5.0,"I love wearing these, they don't irritate my ears and they're pretty good quality. Would definitely recommend! :)"
5.0,Loved them good quality face mask
5.0,"This watch is a must have.  Feels heavy and solid and solid yedt sleek.<br />Looking for something that stands out or starts conversations?  Behold the Blue Binary Watch.<br /><br />My first watch had a button (lower right) stick so I couldn't adjust for daylight savings.  I rated at a 4.5 stars as it was still one awesome watch.<br /><br />The seller took good care of me, accepted the return no questions and got a replacement out.<br /><br />People, for the price, you can't go wrong."
5.0,Yeah
5.0,"Good material, nice fit, lovely design, perfect purchase."
5.0,"I gave my sister this watch for Christmas and she loves it, One of the best buys i made,"
5.0,"The X-Large is perfectly sized for a busty plus-size lady. The material is soft and comfy. I just wore it to lift weights and it was perfect, so I ordered two more! The higher neckline is nice because the shirt doesn't sag down when I'm working out. (But the neckline is low enough so it won't rub on your neck.)"
5.0,"I was looking for a distinctive watch, that was elegant, without being too elegant, so to speak.  Nowadays, many<br />watches have the same boring design.  Slight copies of each other.  This watch was carefully designed & assembled.<br />This watch took creativity, & the company XIN LINGYU deserves credit for designing such a unique watch.<br />I have purchased other items from XIN LINGYU, & every single purchase has been exactly the same.<br />Others shoppers here may have passed by the products the company provides, either being hesistant or skeptical<br />for whatever reason, however, XIN LINGYU is a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED seller here on Amazon."
5.0,Very comfortable.wear a 12..but got a 13..like a glove..
5.0,"These base layers are so warm and comfortable! I got myself the black set, and it works with anything I wear. I‚Äôm 5.3‚Äô and 116 lb, I got size XS. It fits perfectly. I can‚Äôt wait for some ski trips!"
5.0,love it very elegant. my daughter will be surprise when she wears this on her wedding day
5.0,Very nice a little thick for me but my husband loves them.
5.0,This was a graduate gift and is of hefty weight and very nice for the price!
5.0,"Love these. My kids had to wear crazy socks to school and these were perfect and so, so cute."
5.0,These earrings are super cute. Many compliments.
5.0,"Purchased for a friend's bridal shower but realized it would be too big so I kept it for myself. She said she wears a size 10/large, so I purchased the XL as recommended, but it fit my XL size 14 body. My breasts are very large (42 G) and this style works great for them! My husband loved it on me."
5.0,"Very good sunglasses, I just returned because it wasn't made for my kind of face. But they are beautiful and comes in a beautiful box."
5.0,"The socks felt wonderful!  Not at all binding at the top of socks.  I will wash by hand .( not my usual thing to do). Yes , I recommend them!"
5.0,"Great & very nice, my wife was happy with it... thanks"
5.0,"I really am pleased with color, style and fit! Would definitely buy this suit again!"
5.0,El producto vino defectuoso y responsablemente me lo cambiaron excelente compa√±√≠a la recomiendo

5.0,I love it because its unique. There's more novelty for me than anything. I just don't like the numbers are so tiny.
5.0,"The gift was to an English lady. She thought it went well with the NinaQueen  Love Coronation, and treasure chest."
5.0,Love the coverage! Not see-through and they hold everything in! Great for postpartum
5.0,"Love these, get lots of compliments."
5.0,Everyone loved them.  Sizes were true to label.  Go Niners!
5.0,Cute.  Love they way they look on my ears.
5.0,"Great sunglasses, great price. Got these for my husband who cannot have expensive sunglasses because he breaks or loses them too often. They look nice and are good quality."

5.0,No problems  with product or seller
5.0,The medium fit him perfect
5.0,this watch was a gift.  the person loves it.  that's all I can say -
5.0,"My nephew loved the shirt I sent to him, for his dog"
5.0,I bought this for my dad's Moto 360 1st edition. It for great. The tools provided make it easy to switch the bands. I haven't tried swapping out any of the links yet but it looks to be fairly simple. Band really looks and feels great.
5.0,Husband loves it!  Does not roll up and is soft and very warm..
5.0,"This shirt runs a tad big.  I normally wear a size Medium, but after reading other reviews I ordered a Small.  Glad I did--it fits just right.  The material is so soft, I'm going to order it in another color.  It also arrived 2 days earlier than told, which was great too!"
5.0,"Good for sun protection, swimming, outdoor work, working out, great fit, comfortable, would order again, or two or three."
5.0,Very nice. Just as described.
5.0,Fits beautifully - comfortable like a t-shirt - actually flattering - great find!
5.0,Bought for husband‚Äôs retirement. Was very impressed with the quality of the hat for the price
5.0,Larger than what came in my wallet. Good quality
5.0,"Really really cute. I am a 36D and it doesn't provide a lot of support, but it is so darn cute under just about every top. Everyone asks where I got it!"
5.0,It is good material. Good and thick don't have to worry about it ripping or tearing. It has alot of space for the size bag it is.
5.0,"The Leopard print is very yellowy gold, not neutral tan like the pic. It was just too yellow, returned."

5.0,Good fit and quality of material is nice.
5.0,Loved this item wear them every day
5.0,"So cute, my daughter is obsessed with this dress. She 4, 42 pounds i ordered a 5T and its fits well and still some more room to grow into. Quality is pretty good, and the material is perfect. Will be ordering more!"
5.0,This was exactly what I wanted. It arrived within a few days after I ordered and fit perfectly. It doesn't shrink in the wash either.
5.0,"If you follow the size chart, this will fit you as expected. I'm 5'2&#34; and had to hem this a good 3-4&#34; to wear with my flat espadrilles.<br /><br />I can't emphasize how much I adore this dress! It's extremely figure-flattering for curvy girls. The pattern camouflages everything you'd want downplayed and the solid color break just below the bust helps define a waistline.<br /><br />I am large-chested and was relieved to find that the seam didn't fall in the middle of my chest like most dresses do. It hits in the perfect spot. I think the weight of the dress, thanks to the material, helps with that."
5.0,"we love these shirts, bought 5 different models of them! perfect gift for the person who has everything!"
5.0,"I like this watch, you could wear for casual or dressy. It‚Äôs a good deal for the money!"

5.0,"Bought these for my bridesmaids, they a super trendy and look gorgeous!"
5.0,Best sandals for children I‚Äôm very happy and my daughter lives them. She says they‚Äôre very comfortable. Very sturdy as well!
5.0,"Light, comfortable. I'm happy"
5.0,"My mom loved them. So far, so good."
5.0,True to size. No need to order up. I would definitely purchase another color.
5.0,This just an absolutely simple adorable dress. The material is soft and comfy. I was happy that it fit just great. Can double as summer wear or if paired with some great stockings and nice ankle boots it can be a great winter/fall look.
5.0,I ordered this to give me room to grow during my pregnancy. Put a thin belt right above my belly and it looked so cute. The material was thick so it was actually warm enough to wear through winter especially if you added tights under it.
5.0,Lovely. I like it a lot. A piece was broken but I assume that was bc of poor handling from the carrier
5.0,I love how absorbent these are and I‚Äôve been using these in my 11 month old they fit pretty good just a tiny bit of a gap around the legs but that‚Äôs to be expected with it being for 18 months but these bad boys can hold a massive pee way more absorbent and better quality than any in store generic training underwear I bought 2 packs I wish I would have gotten more of these.
5.0,As soon as I opened the package I fell in love! I bought it for my daughter and now I want one! It‚Äôs better than I expected! It‚Äôs spacious and a great size! The material is thick! I recommend 100%!

5.0,"So cute, they run small, but I know that so I buy a bigger size than I usually wear."
5.0,"Well made, very comfortable and flattering."
5.0,Great product  Great fit.  Sizing is perfect
5.0,I love it looking for more..
5.0,I bought this dress for my wife .<br />She loves it .
5.0,They were beautiful to wear. for our lula. It looked so parent
5.0,My first order came with a broken link. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent out a new one. Love the quality and style. They do have a bit more of a heavy feel when you wear it. Definitely recommend.
5.0,"I haven't had a chance to used these bags yet, they are for my motorcycle travels. I plan to use them to consolidate several pieces of soft gear and clothing, and for dirty laundry. The construction seems sufficient to serve these purposes."
5.0,Bought this for my 18 year old daughter and she loves it. The chain is delicate. Good price on this.
5.0,Like the durability and how it holds my long brade
5.0,Wore this dress to an outdoor wedding. It was very comfortable and breathable great fabric. Color. was spot on in photos and true to size. The lace pattern carries just enough elegance to be worn to a wedding or casual gathering. You‚Äôll love this dress!
5.0,Beautiful watch looks good on my arm keeps accurate time!
5.0,Purchased this as a gift for my Florida Gator boss for Christmas.  He has already worn in a bunch of times...perfect for that Gator Fan in your life!! :)
5.0,Love it! Nice size and looks sharp! The little pouch is super nice too
5.0,"After reading reviews about sizing, I ordered a size up (XL) and it turns out it's actually sized pretty accurately. The sleeves aren't tight at all on me.  I loved this so much, I just ordered two more in different colors, but in L this time. It is made of a heavy t-shirt type material (not lined on inside like a sweatshirt) and it does have thumb holes."
5.0,"I was so excited to see this dress. I bought the knee length floral ones in navy and wine. The material is like a soft buttery material, not see through at all and holds up. I have one in a longer length and it has held up for over 2 years. Color stays, no pilling, doesn't shrink or lose its shape. They fit well. I ordered a large, I'm 5'10 182lbs 36DD at Victorias Secret, and a 32in waist. My hips flare out to 42, but the dress is very flattering and goes cute with a cute and ankle boots."
5.0,"I bought these because they reminded me of my BF my grandma. She had a pair of oversized sunglasses in every color to go with each of her outfits as I was growing up. But these are just like the ones she had until the day she past. These glasses are fashionable, have a great color that they can be paired with anything you wear whether it‚Äôs business, casual, or elegant these will standout as an accessory. They are well made, come with their own carry bag to avoid them from getting scratched, their arms are not flimsy and seem durable. They are a great purchase and priced right. Thanks for bringing back so many found memories with a great product!"
5.0,"Very pretty, I love it! Although I do not recommend it, I have slept with this on several times and have had no problems with it breaking. It is quite long though so it will sometimes catch on pants... just be careful how you move!"
5.0,I bought this as a gift for someone. I went one size up (she normally wears 1x) but I bought a 2x and it fit her perfectly! She loves it.
5.0,"Oh so Classy, these are my new BFF's. They go well with anything and they came in a really cute but odd little case. I need more colors!"
5.0,Love the boots.  Have them in black also
5.0,Great to find extra small!
5.0,My elderly friend loves Betty Boop so I gave her this mask.
5.0,It‚Äôs a lovely little tote! It fits so many things inside it. Great for my weekend travelsüòç
5.0,Best summer b a g ever.  Big Javits fan for twenty years
5.0,"Very comfortable; they fit as expected. I purchased a package of Hanes boxers a few months ago and, while they were cheaper, they weren't nearly as comfortable. The comfort and more robust construction are worth the price."
5.0,"We dressed as WuTang as a family Halloween costume! Everyone loved it!!! The mask were a little snug and not very sheer, but they work!"
5.0,These are very light weight and I love the clear distinction between the bifocal and the normal lense.
5.0,"Excelente, igual a la foto"
5.0,These are the best glasses for any indoor gardener
5.0,This dress is adorable. The fit is great and the dress itself is beautiful. The material is thin but nothing shows through!

5.0,"This outfit was exactly what I ordered. Fits my baby perfect. I ordered 12 to 18 months, she wears 18 months. It fits perfect!"
5.0,Love Knockaround and love these Fast Lanes. I‚Äôve actually owned about 5 Fast Lanes pairs now (including 2 custom) and have had about 10 pairs in total.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1 Cheap and affordable<br />2 Good quality for the price<br />3 Features: customization (on website) and polarization for the price<br />4 Great fit and finish.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 I don‚Äôt have enough of these sunglasses!
5.0,"This cape is absolutely beautiful and well made.....soooo soft.....would recommend to anyone......has a detachable scarf, so you can interchange scarfs, or go without one...üòä"
5.0,Very pretty design and comfortable to use. The mounting clips seem a little light but they work ok.
5.0,Me encanto. Son muy coquetas. Son anti deslizantes. Mi ahijada est√° aprendiendo a caminar y le dan buen soporte
5.0,These are delicious and taste just like the ones that I bought when I was in Israel in May.
5.0,"I love this bracelet. The deciding factor were the birds. I love birds. Fits nicely and can't complain about the price as I have seen others that are similar, probably sturdier, but more expensive. I just like it for fashion purposes."
5.0,"I used to have these as a kid, and recently I gifted this to my younger cousin. She loves it! Such a fun gift!!!!"
5.0,"I bought two different print and love it. I am 5'9"" and it hit me at the perfect length."
5.0,I love it so much I ordered more
5.0,"Can't go wrong with this workhorse. It's not a G-Shock by any stretch of the imagination, but never claims to be. It's a good, budget timekeeper. Sure, the &#34;quality&#34; is in the &#34;budget&#34; range, but as long as you're not going Hulk on things, it's all gonna be fine."
5.0,Looks great on my Casio dive watch.
5.0,"Love it! Fits nicely, too"
5.0,Very cute. Would buy it again.
5.0,These are so comfy and fit perfect. High quality. I'm tall and these actually rest on the top of my foot. It's hard to find a good pair of sweats but these are perfect. I'll be buying more. I highly recommend.

5.0,"Cute, and grandson loved them."
5.0,"looks good and feels good, not jewler quality but for like 40 bucks u cant go wrong. fasho would recommend to buy"

5.0,Love it!  I will be ordering another one in a different color!
5.0,"If your future is so bright, you've gotta wear shades then this 2-pair deal is will be just right for you. You get the black on black version as well as black with white pair. Comfortable fit, and nice styling. These aren't Maui Jim's but for the price, they will do the job and make you look nice."
5.0,this looks great for the price. Runs a little big but perfect for the fall
5.0,Purchased as a gift for grandson.  The fit was perfect and the quality was good.  He loved it so we're happy.
5.0,"I own 2 other of these dresses, and this one is also great.  It has stretch and no wrinkles.  Beautiful colors and true to size.  I hope to wear this to my Grandson's wedding in November, as their colors are teal and burgandy.  Now for the shoes."
5.0,Me encanto!!
5.0,"I love this!! I actually bought this comb to wear at my sister's wedding, but she loved it so much she actually wore it herself! It looks exactly like the picture, and it looked great in her hair -- perfectly sparkly and shiny with the cutest little embellishments. :) It stayed in her hair all day/night, would definitely recommend this to any of my friends!"
5.0,I really like these black flouncy pants--they are a breath of fresh air after the skinny pants I have bought in the past
5.0,One size fits all and keeps you cool when the weather is hot. Protects from sunburn very well.
5.0,"This strap is perfect. Very simple to install, and because it's a single pass strap, the watch doesn't sit too high on the wrist. I have a larger wrist and the length is perfect. Very happy with my purchase"
5.0,"Gave it as a birthday gift , best friend loved it, colors are vibrant."
5.0,This is nice and hides the bald spot without being too tight.
5.0,I bought these for my Great  Aunt and she loves them very plush and comfortable . The gripper soles make them pass as slippers too.
5.0,I'm sorry it do work and it works good... the person that  I brought it for did not know how to connect it..I try to connect it myself and it works perfect
5.0,"I just put these slippers on. They fit well and seem to have a nice, sturdy some. They feel a little stiff and snug but certainly seem like they just need a little time to break in. Would definitely buy again."
5.0,Scarf is beautiful. Matches my new coat.
5.0,My daughter loves tsum tsums. This is a nice shirt.
5.0,Girlfriend loved it. Got it for a NYE party. Fit perfectly.

5.0,"Very cute, good value !!!!Great for my granddaughter who loves owls."
5.0,"You will be very happy with this purchase.  I wish the maker would add more color options in this style: tan, pink, navy, green, brown, rust, maroon, and grey."
5.0,"Very good watch, has self winding or mechanical winding. I like to see all the movements inside the watch. The one thing I don't like is that the band is a little tough but overall great"
5.0,"You like Star Wars?<br />Buy it.<br />Has an insert for added protection, washable, Star Wars. No need to say more."
5.0,"Fits very nice for my daughter who is 3 and a half years old. She weighs 42 lbs and is very tall for her age. She‚Äôs 102 cm inches tall. She like ballet a lot and I already had it in the color lavender so I wanted another color so she could have two of them. I  Will definitely buy from seller again, Thank you"
5.0,The only size available at the time I ordered was a small and typically I‚Äôm a small and didn‚Äôt think twice about it. This dress fits in the waist but as you can see there is absolutely no coverage up top - I definitely have to wear a camisole underneath or wouldn‚Äôt be able to wear this at all. The problem with that is the back of the dress is so gorgeous I was really hoping to not have to wear anything underneath. The gap is so big and wide there‚Äôs no way I could even sew it together. I am definitely keeping it - I found another dress similar to this one but I prefer the look of this one because the skirt seems fuller than the other one.
5.0,They are perfect. The last ones i had similar to this (but lost one) were larger and it was hard to wear to work and talk on the phone all day. And I‚Äôm also lazy so falling asleep in them was tough since the post part was very long. These are PERFECT. I LOVE the size. Big enough to see. But not annoying to be on the phone with or if I nap in them. I like how shiny they are too.
5.0,my niece loves them..im the best auntie ever..thankd
5.0,Perfect size & quality!!
5.0,I love it! Great color and jingles when you shimmy. Also it was a good value. The shop where I take lessons charges $25 for something just like this.
5.0,"These were a gift, and she absolutely loves them. Perfect size for everyday."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. It's not too thin but not too thick. Nice smooth material. Fit wasn't too snug but wasn't baggy either. An excellent buy.

5.0,I wear this pretty much all the time! thank you! fast shipping! and the quality is great!
5.0,"They are beautiful, well matched and well set."

5.0,Quality is great.  My wife doesnt like the color.  Everything else is perfect.
5.0,Amazing socks - great support! Will buy again!
5.0,"This is a really great set. Its non irritating (for my tag averse kid), soft and comfy. The front has a lining and scope for inserting a pad if you so want. This did not come with any pads but almost any should fit. it is totally wearable without as well. The material is great quality and not thin or thready. The elastic is soft and non digging. My kid loves the colors and the softness & comfort. For that reason..this gets a 5 star"
5.0,ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! GAVE THEM AS GIFT & THEY WENT OVER BIG! WELL MADE & SUBSTANTIAL YET DAINTY :)
5.0,Great mask. Comfortable and flattering!

5.0,Loved the pic and comfortable to wear
5.0,Loved the earrings.  Wore them to a wedding and they matched the colors in my Native American Ring and outfit.  Can be worn casually or dressy.
5.0,Nice earrings that you can wear every day.  Made very well. Lightweight
5.0,"cute soft material, beautiful Disney Princess t-shirt for young girls"
5.0,"Was hoping to use this tank as a maternity cami, but it fits great now!  MIGHT stretch some for a pregnant belly, but not for an entire pregnancy for me anyway....Currently I am 5'6&#34;, 143lbs (36C), and I love how it fits me!<br />Great quality material!<br />The green is a bright Kelly Green shade...VERY pretty!<br />Cut is just right on neck, not too high, not too low.<br />Very well made!<br />Love it!<br />I have received this item at a discount for my honest, unbiased review....5 stars!"

5.0,My favorite socks! Seriously so comfy and not tight on legs.
5.0,"Beautiful, Strong, and eye catching!"
5.0,"Bought it as a gift for my friend, it was bigger than I expected and she used it as her carry on for her flight home! She loved it!"
5.0,"Love these earrings. I was looking for something that wouldn‚Äôt hang down and entice my daughter to try and grab at them. These are perfect. My ear is a little red in the picture only because it‚Äôd been so long since I‚Äôve worn earrings.<br /><br />They are simple, but I get a lot of compliments when I wear them"
5.0,"Your typical hundred ounce G.I. issued Hydration pack. More or less connect this to your day pack or you could wear it as is, but wearing it as is just remember you‚Äôre going to have no padding on your straps once again typically used to strap on to your day pack. I‚Äôve also read a lot of reviews complaining about leaks which on mine had no leaks so just make sure your hoses are connected right and your filler cap is closed all the way and you should be fine."
5.0,omg the shirt fits beautifully üòç i have a big chest area so it doesn‚Äôt fit like a bra. so firm n fitting and soft and classy!!! 100/10
5.0,Love this scarf!  Beautiful colors daft and warm. Definitely buying more in different colors!
5.0,"Worked as advertised.  Wanted to buy a pair, but couldn't find a listing for two, so just bought the one.  It has worked well and hasn't failed yet."
5.0,"They are good looking, came in half sizes and they fit well"
5.0,"Very nice, the wife loves hers too!"
5.0,Used this as my Carry On bag for a trip to Costa Rica.  Lots of good pockets for organizing everything.  Fit my back extremely well and was comfortable.  It is now my go to day pack and Airline Carry On bag.
5.0,I honestly night this bathingsuit thinking it wouldn't fit or not compliment my thick shape BUT i was sooo pleasantly surprised that it fit and i feel so super sexy in this. Cheeky does not begin to explain. This might as well be a thong so if you are comfortable showing what your momma gave you then go for it!!
5.0,I have every single color of them . So soft and so flowy and just perfect .
5.0,"Love it! Amazing quality, beautiful detail just as pictured. I ordered a large."
5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this sweater! Fits exactly as expected, and is the perfect combination of oversized, comfy, and stylish. Will definitely purchase more."
5.0,My guy really loves this shirt wears it constantly
5.0,Excellent. That's something my kids and I have been saying to each other for years.
5.0,"Fitbit bands are all so sterile. It‚Äôs nice to have one that actually goes with my wardrobe and looks cute. The metal bit that clips to the Fitbit itself is very substantial, comparable to the quality metal of my favorite herbal shredder. I was very impressed by that. Ideally it would have a clip so I don‚Äôt have to yank it on and off, but I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Fantastic! Quality is about what you would expect for the price, but if you're good with your sunglasses these will do well for you. Easy to adjust and has a quality mirror finish. Perfect for people who lose their glasses a lot"
5.0,"So cute, good quality, runs big"
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, good quality considering the low price."
5.0,"Since I got an iPhone Plus, I've been searching for a wallet that wasn't too massive but would fit my phone. This wallet/wristlet is perfect. It fits all my every day cards plus my stack of giftcards as well as my iPhone Plus. It's not too large to hold in my hand or too heavy with all my stuff in it. The design is super cute and the little tassle that comes with it adds a nice little flare. The material is nice and soft (not pleathery) but seems durable. There is no specific place for my phone, so I've just been putting it in one of the side compartments. But there are 2 large side compartments plus a middle zipper pocket so it doesn't get in the way at all."
5.0,Fit true to size. I purchased the Bella Marie triss Mary Jane in patent red for a 4 year old and she loves them!
5.0,Bought them for my oldest daughter for Christmas and she loves them.  Pocket is a great feature.  Very well made.
5.0,"Las personas que venden este producto en muy amable, muy recomendable"
5.0,"I bought these leggings  so that I could wear them for just for whatever. They are durable and fit me well. The material is soft and does not shaffe my legs. I like these leggings because they been with my body, and make my booty Pop. The blue is a nice color."
5.0,Great fan!!! Perfect addition to my costume!
5.0,"This a very fancy handbag. The brown color in the picture doesnt seem as the same as in person. I would describe the one on the picture a COGNAC color, while in person is more brown. Overall, I am in love with it."
5.0,Love this band strap and link removal kit. Super classy with heavy links.  It comes with some sparkle too! I have very small wrists and have a hard time finding watches that fit me but this one did!
5.0,"I love these sunglasses so much, I ordered a second pair! They are great quality for a good price. I get compliments on them all the time."
5.0,"Very Comfortable, Nice!"
5.0,Cool mask that has a snug fit that is skin tight that fits very well and it is very comfortable.
5.0,So pretty...<br /> Love my party purse
5.0,Thick and comfy. Just the way a great sandal should be. Love them so much I got these in brown also. Great for all day wear!
5.0,......what I was looking for. Large enough for keys change and a little misc. and very well made with a nice 'biner type clip on the end which is attached to a metal ring that in turn protrudes through metal grommets. A sturdy zipper to boot. The clip can also attach to a belt loop. Worth the money!!
5.0,"I bought it to wear on my wedding day, and I‚Äôm glad I did. I loved how it covered over my nose and down to my chin. It was a good fit. Everyone liked the bling. Even though the wedding passed, I‚Äôve continued to use it because it‚Äôs comfortable and pretty. It‚Äôs a nicer quality than expected for the price."
5.0,Fits perfectly!!
5.0,My grandson loves it. He happy because now he has a dolphin necklace like Grandpa. (Mine is a dolphin and much bigger)
5.0,"A little long, but better long than short.  I made to more holes.  They look beautiful.  Nice metal accessories"
5.0,"The shirt, tie, and handkerchief are all beautifully made and the colors are vibrant. I can't tell you how long I looked for a nice shirt online and how thrilled I chose this company to buy it.<br />Personally I rely heavily on the reviews of others when I'm shopping. With that said, it's my goal to be as helpful and as honest as possible when writing a review. [...]"
5.0,Fits as expected.  Nice dress.
5.0,A wonderful thing
5.0,165 lb 39bust 31waist 45hip. I thought the XL fit perfect.
5.0,Love The Dress and Everyone at the Event Loved It! Amazing Fit and Fabric! Will order from this company again
5.0,"This is an amazing deal. The ring was only $11 (that included shipping), and it's ridiculously well made for that price. The Swiss cross design is flawless, and the ring itself has a nice weight to it (and doesn't feel cheap). The band is wide enough to be worn by a man, but not too wide, so it looks good on a woman's hand too. So happy to get such a great ring for such a cheap price!"
5.0,I LOVE these night gowns. I tried one out last summer and quickly ordered 3 more. Since then I‚Äôve order a couple more for myself and given several as birthday and Christmas gifts to all my friends who live in hot climates. They are super comfortable and keep me cool during the hot summer nights. I can not say how much I LOVE these gowns.
5.0,Great wings. My daughter wants to be a fairy for Halloween and they‚Äôll look well for it. They fit well too and seem like they won‚Äôt fall off easily
5.0,Great trim fit with tapered legs that have a long enough inseam to fit my tall frame. I've already ordered another pair.
5.0,"I needed a watch that I don't have to worry about, and this has been it for the last couple of years. I'm afraid to buy a smartwatch because if I lose/damage it, there goes $200. This watch works for everything I need. It's slim, so you barely notice you have it, but has some nice color accents and is a perfect size."
5.0,"This is so sleek and handy. Beautifully made with very easy organization of makeup, cards, and phone. I use this for special events and always get compliments. I will continue to order from Heshe."
5.0,"These masks are a perfect fit for my somewhat small face.  There's enough fabric to cover my face from ear to ear and nose to chin, and the design sculpts the mask so that there's no gaping.  I've not tried wearing them with filters inserted, but the 3 layers of fabric seem to provide better-than-average protection.  I've washed them by hand; they wash well and dry overnight."
5.0,Glad to have this digital sports watch. I wear this during my work out in the gym..Very nice to give as a gift tooüòò
5.0,"I‚Äôm a 5'7"", 150lbs and a 34DD ...and CAN'T STAND tight bra bands! I‚Äôm one of those women who takes their bra off the moment they walk in the house, so even though I‚Äôm a DD, I often buy bras size 36 or 38D just so I don‚Äôt feel the band digging around my rib cage. I tried on this bra as soon as I received it earlier today, and haven‚Äôt taken it off yet even though I‚Äôll be home all day! It really is THAT comfortable! The product image recommends size XXL for band size 40 and 42, but after reading the reviews for this bra I decided to order the XXL in Coffee, hoping it would be loose enough around my 34"" rib cage but still supportive - and it is! It‚Äôs SUPER comfortable!! But the XXL might be a little too big for me because it forms a very slight gap close to my armpit (not enough to show under my clothes). This bra is light, very soft against my skin, but supportive and very concealing... even worn with a slightly see-thru white t-shirt, it creates no unseemly bulges, not even on the back! The band is so soft and stretchy that I think the XL would have been just as comfortable for me, and might fit me a tad better. I‚Äôm going to keep the XXL because it will be very comfortable to wear on long rides, but now I‚Äôm considering also ordering the 2-pack (Black + Nude) in size XL."
5.0,very nicely made
5.0,Very colorful and fit beautifully
5.0,A little longer than expected and I‚Äôm tall. But it‚Äôs ok because you should only wear these pants with extra high heels so perfect!
5.0,I have gotten so many compliments!! This necklace goes with virtually everything!!
5.0,Comfy and cute addition to my outfit.
5.0,Fit perfect. I got a lot of complements with this dress. Very comfy and beautiful..

5.0,Nice selection for the price
5.0,Works really well.
5.0,I wore this for the preakness and it was absolutely perfect! I received so many compliments on this hat. I can't wait to wear it again!
5.0,Fits in my purse. So cute. Have not tested in downpours or high winds though.
5.0,"Cute! Nice cotton fabric, love it!"
5.0,I had ordered a size smaller and had to return it. But this one fits perfectly.  I love it
5.0,Too cute. Runs 2 sizes small so order up up.
5.0,It has a large brim but that really is what you need to shield your child's face from the sun.  It's lightweight as well.
5.0,Durable and comfy
5.0,It's a good shirt. It's a bit on the thin side but I'm okay with that.
5.0,"Arrived on time, came with new pins! Easy to install and very solid."
5.0,This is my favorite necklace i love it its simple an clean mothing hella fancy but i like that
5.0,"Apparently the size I ordered is more like 1/2 larger but socks will compensate and after washing may shrink, we‚Äôll see. But overall workmanship is good, and does not have an formaldehyde odor."
5.0,This dress is worth each penny. Got many compliments when ever I wear this dress. Material is good and colors are the same as you see in pictures.
5.0,Bought as a gift and he loves it
5.0,"As a large busted woman I have a hard time finding strapless bras but I had to have one for a wedding. This is by far the best one I've ever had. I would recommend doing your measurements and buying accordingly (even if that results in a size you didn't think you were).<br /><br />You get your size by measuring your rib cage and then around your bust. Your rib cage measurement is the size (ex: 32"") and your cup size is the number of inches difference there is between the two measurements (ex: 3"" difference would be a C, 6"" difference would be F or DDD).<br /><br />It comes with removable straps but if you plan to wear it strapless then make sure the rib measurement is snug."
5.0,"I love the way this bag can be used for so many things!  I like it as a backpack!  The backpack straps are easy to put on/take off.  You can put your shoes, fitness clothes, etc in here very easily!!"
5.0,I just love my beautiful nautical seashell necklace. I feel like I'm on a tropical Island wearing it  Just love it
5.0,This sweater is awesome it fits true to size. Very soft and comfortable. Best cardigan ever!!! If you are 5‚Äô2 and under I think it would be too long for you . I am 5‚Äô4 and it almost hits the ground. Be aware. If you are a tall girl I would get one in every color. Bottom line get this sweater . It is nice and warm. I wore it in 45 degree weather and it was warm. Best cardigan I have purchased!
5.0,fast delivery
5.0,"I now own 4 pair of these pants and they're my favorite thing I've found on Amazon. They feel amazing, they fit so well, they don't stretch out over time, the colors are so fun, and of course, they have pockets. Don't pass up on these!"
5.0,"I love this necklace!<br /><br />I bought this necklace for the length and look, and it's definitely a winner in my book. It's long enough to be worn as a casual accessory, or with a little black dress as a classy but quirky piece of jewelry. The colours are nice and bright, and the chain doesn't pull on your neck like some others can.<br /><br />I would buy this necklace again for sure."
5.0,"Fits perfect. I'm a woman with a slightly larger bone structure and I have it sized for the middle notch  , nice leather and looks great. Not too thick  or thin and I think it'll just look better with age.<br />Fast shipping for China"
5.0,I liked the style of the shoes. I only wished that I did not have to size up because that made the shoes run too big due to my feet being narrow and the shoes were medium.
5.0,"I found the right place and easy access for everything I want to carry.  Before buying, it was just a guess because I couldn't find any measurements.  Overall, it 10 wide by 10 high with a 3 "" wide bottom.  Looking at the front, the lower zip pocket fit my phone, the upper zip pocket my kindle.  Inside, I put all the usual like wallet and bag with small items. on the back is a deep pocket for a pen, notebook, papers.  Under the front lower zip pocket,is another open pocket where I put my keys, with a decorative key fob hanging out for easy access.  Finally, everything easily sorted and found."
5.0,Good fit! Beautiful dress.
5.0,Very pleased with these slippers. Purchased them for my grandson and he loves them. very comfortable and warm.
5.0,"Did not fit watch I was buying for but I made it work.  Bought for a Willful SW021 id205L.  I bought a 20mm, probably needed a 19mm.  I don't know if an 18 would have worked.  I used the clips from the original band and made it work.  Still satisfied with the purchase."
5.0,I was super nervous to purchase this since the sizing reviews are all over the place.<br />However it fit perfectly. I bought a MED since that is what I normally wear although I'm 8 months pregnant. So this fit good pregnant and I feel like it will fit just as well next year if I want to wear it without a belly! Lol.<br />The material is kind of costumey but not bad at all. It wasn't really see through and I was super comfortable in it.
5.0,"the earrings were a little bit bigger than i expected, which gives it a pin-up look. i love it!"
5.0,I bought these along with a fun pirate shirt to wear for my boys pirate party.  They fit as I had hoped and they were also thin enough top be cool and comfortable in Texas humidity!
5.0,Sooooo cute! It's a little bigger than I expected but I'm not complaining. Came immediately in the mail and no issues with packaging. Love it!
5.0,"I didn't want to give a bad review due to size, so I'm hoping this will help others out. I am 5'11"" tall, 235 pounds and always order XL shirts and jackets. XL in this jacket was snug with only a t-shirt under it. No way could I wear a sweatshirt under it. I wish it worked out, it is comfortable and very pack-able (bought it for hiking). I will however need to return it due to it being too small. Hope this helps someone."

5.0,Fits great. Love that my braids can fit in without feeling so type.
5.0,"I have a small head ( from the top of my ear to the top of my head ) and most hats fold down my ears and it hurts! This hat fits me perfect! I have bought a couple of them for friends and I have worn the hat at a fundraiser for the American Cancer Society, Relay for Life."
5.0,Great choice
5.0,"The Sheec slingback sock made my shoes more comfortable than simple stockings. The fabric is thicker and offered more cushion so that the toes did not rub and become sore. The strap around the heal is clear and was comfortable to wear with my slingback, pointy toed shoes. The vamp is quite low, easy to adjust and did not show above the vamp on my shoes. Since they are made from a durable, thicker material, I expect them to last."
5.0,The sleeves were a little long but all in all this jacket looked great!!
5.0,I love my slippers
5.0,The grand kids are ecstatic with these masks
5.0,If you're looking for a cute baggy beach shirt this is it!<br />It's super soft and adorable! Exactly what I was looking for!<br />Had a weird damp feel and smell to it when I first got it but a quick wash and it's perfect!

5.0,"This dress is perfect. I'm 6'1 155lbs, so I purchased an XL and very glad I did. Its long enough and fits well in the bust area. I want this dress in every color!"
5.0,"These gloves are great. I got them for a cosplay and they are perfect. They are large around the wrist, but I expected that because I have very small wrists/hands. Very great."
5.0,"At first I was a little bit skeptical about purchasing this purse because of very few reviews, but I'm glad I did. Everything works on it, no stains, zippers work, strap and attachments are present. The strap comes stiff, so it needs to be worn in a little bit. The only thing I wish the purse had was additional pockets or compartments."
5.0,"Love how this lays flat on the body. The rings at the end are a nice touch for those of you don't like the camera strap in your face. Meaning, its real nice to have the camera strap fall straight down when you hold the camera to your eye. I wish all camera straps had this feature."
5.0,Fit to size.  My son loves them.. great quality shoes
5.0,"This is a nice necklace with good weight. Mines arrived on time and intact, so I was satisfied with my purchase."
5.0,"but these pants are amazing, they are super warm in the winter, stretchy (something i didn't even realize i would appreciate, but now can't live without) and look great.  it's such an obvious combo but i don't know why there aren't more pants made like this.  the pattern is great and you can dress them up or down as you see fit.  felt compelled to drop a review as i have been searching for similar pants to these but just couldn't find any.  to the manufacturer: please release these pants in more patterns!"
5.0,"Excellent product, according to my wife, for whom I bought these to go with her new coat. Thinsulate lining a need feature - gloves don't need to be bulky to keep hands nice and warm."
5.0,Era un regalo para mi hija y le encant√≥ ... buen tama√±o y material
5.0,LOVE THIS! Makes putting a piercing in my tragus so much easier!!! seems like good quality so far.
5.0,I use these to keep contaminants out of my mushroom cultures growing on 100 mm diameter 15mm tall vented plastic petri dishes.  Works wonderfully.  I cut three and a half squares and then fold this in half.  This is then stretched around the dish.  This length goes around twice giving 4 layers of protection.  I have cultures on petri dishes that have remained contamination free for 18 months (and are probably still OK)
5.0,"I love it and so do my friends! I've ordered more to give out because they love it too. The Blue is beautiful, it lays nice, and it's my new favorite statement necklace!"
5.0,I use it to pick up tools and exension cords
5.0,"It‚Äôs pretty and looks expensive. I wear it as a ‚Äúmini crawler‚Äù and as a drop down as well and it look good. Great for office wear. I did change the backing to my own as it comes with ‚ÄúCurled backing‚Äù thing (Sorry, not sure what the correct term for that is‚Äù."
5.0,Love the look.  Love the comfort.
5.0,Hippie chic
5.0,"I got these for my 2 year old daughter for her first pair of earrings to change into after getting them pierced. She loves minnie mouse, and it is hard to find stainless steel earrings for a reasonable price or in stores (I didn't want her to have sterling silver or anything else for her first new pair.) These are adorable and a great price. She loves them!"
5.0,"I sent this hat to my Mom for a holiday gift. I was on the phone with her when she opened it and she laughed hysterically and said it was perfect. She owns two Frenchies and this is one of the funniest, most unique gifts I have found for her yet. She said it fits great and she receives a lot of compliments (and laughs) when she wears it."
5.0,Pretty enough for the the $! They look real and made well!
5.0,Great to bring to the gym.  Fits everything you need and has a built in hanger.  Excellent quality.
5.0,I bought this T-shirt for my husband because he loves to nap so it was perfect for him! He said it was comfortable and he loves it too! My husband is 510 and Weighs 200 pounds and the large was loose fitting on him but comfortable.
5.0,This Burberry watch was even more gorgeous in person. The box it came in was also beautiful and very protective. This was an amazing purchase on Wal Mart. I couldn‚Äôt be happier!
5.0,"I love this shirt. Such a pretty color. I'm 120 lbs, 34c. I got a medium because I wanted it a little loose. Definitely buying more."
5.0,"Nice quality, especially for the price. My five year old has Sensory issues and is very particular about his shoes and slippers, and he loves these. I also like that the bottoms are nonslip."
5.0,"These Gloria Vanderbilt shorts fit great. Just the right length, they hit me mid-thigh. I am 5'4"" 150 pounds and ordered a size eight. Very comfortable. Material has a bit of stretch to it. Ordered two pairs and both fit the same."
5.0,Amazing product.  Purchased these for my husband after buying a set for myself.  He hated wearing his wedding ring and he will were these everyday.  Customer service is over the top incredible.
5.0,Love them! Great quality and so cute!
5.0,"They arrived very quickly and looks very real. It tricked my parents into thinking I got my cartilage pierced, it does hurt when you touch it on the ear. It also looks very good on lip and nose. I recommend getting it if you don't want actual piercings"
5.0,i loved the ring because it was just as it was descripted
5.0,The picture does not do this stone justice.  It is absolutely beautiful.  Mine had more violet and blue with grains of white.  Very positive energy.  I definitely want to acquire more from this seller as soon as I have the funds.
5.0,Love it So cute!!!
5.0,"I just received the band today! I was worried with all the reviews about the link disconnector not working, but I was able to take out and replace 2 links within 5 minutes! I‚Äôm very pleased with the color and finish, I‚Äôm just waiting to see how well it holds up!"

5.0,Not many frames look good on me but this one does! For the price it's really worth it.
5.0,Best pair of safety glasses i ever bought very comfortable !!!!! and no one is giving me a dime to say this.. Just a old poor man that got tired of buying 1.99 to 3.99 glasses that wouldnt last
5.0,"I love this band for my new Fitbit Alta. The new band makes the Fitbit look classy and like a piece of jewelry, not like a fitness tracker. It's comfortable and fits great. I've received many compliments on it and have only had it a few days!"
5.0,"These probably fit true to size but I wanted them looser so I ordered up one size. They feel very comfy, aren't so thin that you can see thru them and are fast becoming my favorite pair to wear!"
5.0,"Really labor saving, very durable materials, ship fast"
5.0,"quick, easy, works like I expected!"
5.0,Very cute! I use it all the time. Doesn't feel cheap at all. I love it and recommend it. Got many compliments

5.0,Makes great/super cute earrings!

5.0,"It‚Äôs cut to be mid thigh length so maybe a little short for some, but I absolutely love it."
5.0,I wear this bracelet a lot and I love the message on the charm.
5.0,The product arrived sooner than the time promised.<br />The product is in great shape and looks like what the picture and the description shows.<br />The packaging was nice.<br />I have used it for a long time now and it is still in very good shape.<br />The necklace is a little too heavy.
5.0,"LOOOVE this nightgown! It‚Äôs SO soft, very comfortable. It‚Äôs thin, comfortable to sleep in, and cute! I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase. I really think Ekouaer has the market cornered on comfortable nightgowns."
5.0,Super soft nice quality got so many compliments
5.0,My son loved this shirt and the quality was very nice. The sizing was true to actual size as well.
5.0,"Well made, comfortable on my wrist and it looks good.  There are no sharp edges as i have seen and felt on other nylon straps.  The metal loops make it easier to put on wrist."
5.0,"Fabulous! They have the proper Gucci markings, the lenses give good Sun blockage and do not obstruct vision. The design on the frame shows up nicely, and without being gaudy or flashy."
5.0,Love this üòä
5.0,"Love the sandals.  I have a thick foot and the straps cut into my skin after awhile, but that's not the shoes fault."
5.0,My husband loved it and it fit him perfectly. He normally wears a large in t-shirts and a large in this fit great.
5.0,Outstanding product & Seller!!!  Thanks :)
5.0,I love the reckless but it and the others I ordered are too small for me. My grandchildren will love them and they will fit all the girls. So looks like I have part of their Christmas presents or maybe birthdays.
5.0,Me and my sisters dress a little for my granddaughter 3rd birthday party.
5.0,Nice my little brother loves it!!!
5.0,My granddaughter loves basketball and being fashionable.
5.0,I'm very happy with this. Strong and useful. Perfect size.
5.0,"Good fit, attractive appearance. I would order them again."
5.0,"I got this for my 10 year old bunny lover as a Christmas present. I am hoping that it will fit her. Her fingers are as big as mine, and it was quite snug on me. I did not attempt to adjust it because it's for my daughter, and the less we mess with it, the better, I imagine."
5.0,So far they are as advertised!! Very helpful for rainy and nighttime  driving. Eliminates  almost all of the road glare.
5.0,Love the watch. Perfrect for my work.
5.0,"Love~ love it!! I'm addicted to cherry dresses and this one is my new favorite! So comfortable and the fabric is sturdy and forgiving. Would look even better with a petticoat (I don't use one). Top part is stretchy and does have a side zip although I was able to pull overhead without using it. I probably could have gone down a size and been fine but I have a large chest and like to have room to breathe, so I tend to go up just in case. So happy to find this one!"
5.0,"Adorable, perfect fit."
5.0,"I loooove this dress! Just received it in the mail and tried it on. Perfection! I ordered up a size, since I always err on the cautious side when buying things online. I had my 2nd baby 10 months ago, so I wanted my tummy and hips to fit well into it. The top part is slightly big on me through the shoulders with the XL, so if I order again, I will just buy the size that I normally am. I would say it fits very true to size, and it very flattering for those like me who want to hide the tummy and big hips! ;)<br /><br />I bought it especially because of the buttons in the front. That makes it easy for me to nurse while wearing a pretty dress. The fabric is a nice, thick quality. I was very impressed with that. I'm 5'2&#34; and it goes just a couple of inches below my knee.<br /><br />I'll be buying another one in another color soon! It's a very flattering dress!"
5.0,Love these cords. Wear a different stone everyday.
5.0,"I really like wearing this beanie, I wish they had larger sizes tho for my giant head tho."
5.0,This was not a good buy
5.0,"These fit nicely. Just the right amount of hang in the back, but not too much. I absolutely love them for the price!"
5.0,"Great quality, fits perfectly for sizing."
5.0,Very cute dress!<br />Claudia
5.0,Great style.  Just what we were looking for.  Fit is just right.
5.0,"My daughter in law had these on her wish list. I got them for her. I saw her wearing them and she told me she has fat ear lobes so it took some effort to get them on and hooked around but that they easily stay put, they are comfortable, and she loves them. I liked the way they looked on her."
5.0,It does not ride up your legs. It hugs your legs
5.0,"Cool!<br /><br />Gave one to my son and son-in-law, kept two.<br /><br />My glasses/sunglasses do not fog when wearing this.<br /><br />Good product!"
5.0,"Like the flowy-ness, it was tight at my chest, I‚Äôm a 40C, I ordered both L and XL.<br />The L was tight at the chest but the rest of it fit well.<br />The XL was perfect at the chest BUT it was too loose at my waist. Felt like I was wearing a maternity dress"
5.0,"Great goggles.  Light but sturdy solid material, maximum visibility, good suction, no leakage, and it even comes with a carrying case."
5.0,"love the dress ,  its a little small"
5.0,Great clasp especially for the price. Very sturdy and works like a charm. Highly recommended.
5.0,Polarized glasses at this price?! I was stoked to find these and am so glad I got them. I get many complements and have gotten a second pair as a back up so I'll never be without them. My eyes are sensitive and these really protect them.
5.0,"Got this as a surprise gift for the hubby and he loves it! The carbon fiber is so smooth, he is amazed by it. The only thing is he can't carry alot of cash around in it, but other than that he is happy."
5.0,I love it. It fits good the arms are slightly long but  that was expected.
5.0,"After my journey to find the perfect compression for POTS, I have purchased so many version that didn't work.  These pants do not hurt,  itch,  or ride down.  If you need this for Dysautonomia....I think this is the most comfortable kind you can get.  Others I've tried had uncomfortable ribbing or compression that was tight but didn't really push the blood pooling issue from my feet.  One problem I ran into with this brand was the sizing chart.  Im a curvy girl,  thanks to dyautonomia. I've been in the 180s lately... and this chart sized me at an XL, two sizes too big.  Apparently my big booty likes the Large.  So use caution on the sizing chart... but stop reading these reviews and get these now! No I don't get any kick backs from this company or any vendor... I'm just really happy I found the perfect compression."
5.0,Best Baby earrings eveeeer!!
5.0,This is adjustable so fit was not an issue. I have an average size and shaped head.  It works well with sending sweat out to the brim so it stays off my face. Stays cool and have been very happy. I am an avid long distance runner and always where a hat.
5.0,This was a perfect size for my soon to be a teenager granddaughter
5.0,Great quality. HYPOALLERGENIC!!! No irritation.
5.0,I love these socks. Really feel good after wearing them all day!  I'm a lady with size 10 shoe.
5.0,"Thick, heavily impregnated, works fast to kill tarnish."
5.0,Such a beautiful Romper!!! BUY RIGHT NOW
5.0,Quick service. Pretty dress fits in bust but kinda big rest of way.<br />I blv a large would be too small. (I bought XL)<br />So......thinking on it
5.0,"This is a great pair of bottoms to wear casually or even to sleep in the cool nights. I have lost weight due to breastfeeding, tryna gain it back now so I bought the small considering my small waist at the moment. It seemed a little bit loose on me but I am sure it will fit nicely once I gain some weight. I am currently at 97lbs... :'("
5.0,It's very pretty! I love it!
5.0,"The dress fit perfectly,  this actually was her second dress she changed into for her ""Sweet 16"" party! And she'll be able to wear it again!"
5.0,"If I could get away with wearing these every day, I would. I love everything neutral, the stripes just make these fun. They are easy to pair with different styles and colors of tops and different styles of shoes. I wear them as pajamas or a weekend bottom. Really comfortable and fit as expected (I am a 10-ish, so they are on the snugger side, but fit fine in the waste and legs)."
5.0,This is a lovely necklace. I love the colors and it came well packaged and looks exactly like the picture. I would recommend this one.
5.0,Fits as expected. Very warm. I‚Äôve had a lot of compliments on how it looks.
5.0,"Perfect for entrance in to today's events. Yeah, don't really like everyone being able to see what's in my purse, but security at the different venues I attended loved it."
5.0,very nice bracelet. I ordered the large and it fits very well. Nicely made as well
5.0,This is very good belt ... after 6 month it still looks great. Works good will be ordering another in Brown

5.0,"exactly as pictured. They fit well, and look great. I like that there is UV protection."
5.0,I will tell everyone about how nice this bag is.
5.0,worn for a bachlorette party theme - super fun
5.0,Saw this on TikTok and of course had to buy it. The colors are beautifully blended in purple and blue. It‚Äôs looks not maroon in the stock photos but it‚Äôs purple. I wish the tail had a tie not just a clip but that‚Äôs my only complaint.
5.0,Exactly as shown.  Great hat!
5.0,"Comfortable, stylish, true to size"
5.0,Love the necklace. Really pretty
5.0,"I'm dressed and ready for Halloween in under 3 minutes.  Lots of laughs and compliments.  Kids think the gorilla is real.  I was really pleased by the high quality vs the price.  I've paid much more for other Halloween costumes that tear and fall apart easily.  I'm 230 lbs, 5'10"" and it fits snug but comfortable."
5.0,"High quality and stylish! I suffer from terrible migraines and have to wear sunglasses all of the time practically, with time most brands no matter how expensive or how inexpensive they are they cause me awful pain above my ears, not with these babies!  I am able to wear them or place them on top of my head as I do when I go inside and not get the normal pain I usually get.<br />They are a very high quality material as well and can take being dropped as well.<br />I am completely happy with these and I have three pairs in a few colors and styles! I love them all!!"

5.0,Bought this for my nephew for Christmas and he loved it!
5.0,Grandson in heaven!

5.0,I love these! They are a little large.I went back and ordered a smaller size and then ordered 4 colors. They are super comfortable and I love the color and fit.
5.0,"The outfit ! The wig! perfect for my little villain. The dress fit her great, the train was a little long but she looked adorable"
5.0,You cannot go wrong with this dress. For $12 it‚Äôs a crazy steal. Lightweight enough to beat the summer heat. Well constructed. Flattering fit even for this old lady at 64. I prefer it with a tank top layered over the dress but took some pics without to demo its cuteness for all ages. Can‚Äôt speak to durability because I just received it but it washed well. I am barely under 5 feet and 120 pounds...size small is perfect. It doesn't hide my flab roll in back but what close fitting garment does?  I just ordered another. Highly recommended.
5.0,So happy with this dress that I bought it in three colors!  Fit is as expected.  Flattering fit.  Lighter colors a little see-through.  Darker colors perfect!

5.0,good size. just big enough
5.0,Bought these for my daughter and she wears them all the time. Perfect for gifts!
5.0,"These socks are amazing. Im very picky about the kind of socks I need to wear with my Business shoes and having too thick of socks or to tight of socks doesnt work for me. These socks are extremely comfortable, nice soft quality. Not nylon thin and not extremely think. A perfect fit. Also, for the price, you get several pairs in a bundle. I will be purchasing a few more."
5.0,Quality wool shirt - with wonderful design. Perfect for skiing and as warm underwear in cabins. Very stylish. Wool does not itch.
5.0,"These three pairs of pants are suitable in size, comfortable in fabric and low in price. The cost performance is really good. And after machine washing, no fade, no shrinkage, no pilling, suitable for little girls daily wear."

5.0,Excellent price and super comfy!
5.0,Love how soft it is.
5.0,"This dress was a great buy overall. I got a small, and it fit very nicely. It was a bit large in the chest area, but not too bad. The only thing is, you can see all the curves and panty lines in the pictures!! Something about the material brings that out. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs the only downside."
5.0,They don‚Äôt come off at night. These are a great price. They fit perfect. Not too tight and not too loose and I have a small head. It fits me and my 7 year old daughter.

5.0,"day 1, felt great using the product.  It provided stability to my back on leg day.  Got to get use to the ribs."
5.0,"Very pretty dress, fabric is soft and comfortable just a bit snug for the size I ordered, but nice dress."
5.0,Girlfriend loves them
5.0,Gift.  Darker stone than shown.<br />Still very nice.
5.0,I chose this because it goes win any outfit so I never have to take it off and it's just simply beautiful. Came in nice packaging and is very study. I hardly take it off except to shower and clean my face or swim but that's for most jewelry anyways.
5.0,"I now have this in 2 colors.  Loved the gray one so much, that I came back and brought the white one.  One of my favorites!!"
5.0,Very beautiful and does a good job. The only qualm I have is that sometimes I pick up metal office supplies accidentally with my fitbit because the magnet is so strong (not a big problem!).
5.0,Bought for my grandson on his 5th birthday. He love it. The quality was exceptional.
5.0,Small and compact. Does the job and then gets out of the way.
5.0,I was surprised by how much I like this shirt. It fits comfortably and is long enough to cover properly if I'm wearing leggings.
5.0,Not sure if there was a size I choose or not but they are size large. Didn‚Äôt bother my son so I kept them Perfect official sock as pictured. Fast shipping.
5.0,Its a sweet mask
5.0,"I purchased the white and black tiger as a gift for a 12 year old boy.  He was so excited to get this and wears it all the time!  The hoodie has a silky feel to it and is very lightweight.  The print is amazing.  It washes up well and seems to be holding up.  I would recommend purchasing if you want a decent quality, original hoodie."
5.0,Well made and great price.  Such a nice gift for my daughter‚Äôs friend.
5.0,Love the Dress
5.0,WORKS GREAT
5.0,Ran a little small but luckily we have another princess in the house who the slipper fits.
5.0,very soft with adjustable straps.
5.0,Excellent.I like it.
5.0,Very comfortable love these sneakers...
5.0,"I love these sunglasses. They're so awesome and fit perfectly on my face. They are my favorite ones I've had in a while. They look super cute at the beach, shopping, etc. If you're looking for cute, stylish, and fun sunglasses for a great price, then these are the perfect ones for you!"
5.0,"I love this bag. The picture doesn‚Äôt do justice to the color. I put it next to the coffee thing just to give an idea of size.  It was exactly as described but I didn‚Äôt do my due diligence by measuring the dimensions of my friend‚Äôs purse to compare to the size I was looking for (I wanted bigger because I really do carry ‚Äúeverything but the kitchen sink‚Äù in my purses. So, I gave this five stars because it‚Äôs not the seller‚Äôs fault I didn‚Äôt measure. It‚Äôs a great purse so I guess I‚Äôll have to decide what I do and don‚Äôt need to carry‚ÄîI really don‚Äôt need to carry 50 ink pens, I guess."
5.0,Wife‚Äôs love it
5.0,Great material.Great quality.Given as gift and loved.
5.0,The band fits my watch perfectly and it looks really good on.
5.0,Looooove these shoes! My man loves sexy heels and he couldnt get enough of me in these.. Fit true to form
5.0,"bought the hat for a friend for fathers day, came in quicker than i thought, seems to be good, tried it on and it a perfect fit for me so i know it will fit him, thank you so much!!!"
5.0,"I love the wallet...Very roomy, convenient and luxurious looking...I am very pleased with it, and would recommend it highly..."
5.0,"Great quality, and fit so well and I'm glad I got these.  They are not bulky, and I will still be able to wear my flip flops in the winter months."
5.0,"I love this purse. It's one of the few I've used for any length of time. The bag itself has held up remarkably well. Sturdy zipper. One inside pocket. The handles, while still perfectly functioning and sturdy, do show some wear fairly quickly at the seam. For me, this is a non-issue. It adds to the feel of the bag in my opinion. But it might be a bother for some. I get tons of compliments on it every time I go out."
5.0,Omg I love the feel of this material! It is so soft  and comfy. It is a little bigger around the collar but still a great shirt for fall. Might have to get in another color
5.0,"As expected, good fit. Son loved it!"
5.0,Donated the unopened and unused ones to a homeless shelter after not needing them all for a school play.
5.0,"Great socks, will make you smile"
5.0,I love it my daughter favorite
5.0,"Love love love this bra! I have large breaststroke so its hard for me to find a bra that is sexy, supportive, and doesn't go up too high. The lace stretches a little, but not enough to cause a huge issue. I had a washing machine issue and I ruined my bra, but I have a new one on the way because this is my favorite bra! Comfy to wear all day too"
5.0,"I absolutely love these Yoga pants! The waist doesn‚Äôt roll, the legs stay put- no matter what position I put my body in. Not to mention they look good on...."
5.0,Super comfy pants. I take piyo and I haven‚Äôt tried these in class. I just imagine that they are too big and flowy for an active class. But I think they would be nice for a slow flow or vinyasa yoga. I was told on multiple occasions that I look like jasmine from Aladdin which is why I‚Äôm awarding these pants with five stars.
5.0,"Cute and comfy, what's not to love? After breaking my ankle (I wouldn't recommend it) trying to find a comfortable dress shoe after rehabilitation has been a challenge. I am so glad I found these shoes! Wore them to a formal gala and was able to wear them without issue for the entire performance. Highly recommended!"
5.0,She loves them. Thanks
5.0,I love these stones. they are beautiful and just as represented. They cam right away and are perfect for the project for which i bought them I am very pleased. Thank you.
5.0,"Soft, stretchy, and perfect for running or wearing around the house. I love that I can pull it over my ears for a winter run or fold it to make it skinnier. Have barely taken mine off and just ordered more colors. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Fits great, fingers are a little too long"
5.0,"Bought for my sister for her Birthday, she loved it and even wore it that day!"
5.0,"I'm St Patrick's Day lots of people wanted to get their photo with me. I added the pipe and cane, beard. But everything else came with it. Quality could be a little better. It'll last for a few Saint Patrick's Day."
5.0,Perfect üëç
5.0,"Excellent. I have purchased twice and will continue to buy.  I have been gifting them to family, friends and people I meet, who have difficulty working all day wearing a mask."
5.0,I love this piece!  It's a great statement and it is heavy too!
5.0,"Love it!  Perfect size bag.  At first the only thing I didn't like was the Velcro, I was concerned I would get it caughgt on all my sweaters, but I haven't and it's a convenient way to know everything's secure.  I like the two outside zip pocket. Inside there is another zip pocket and 2 open pockets, which I wish were just a little deeper.  I really like that the size can be adjusted with a zipper, although, be careful doing so while wearing certain fabric, like sweaters or material likely to pill."
5.0,"In athletic shirts I usually by a large, in t-shirts I usually buy XL, I saw this ran small and bought it in a XXL, I'm glad I did.  I think the XL would have been too tight, and a Large wouldn't have gone over my head.  The fabric is nice and seems durable, I wore it on my run this morning in the early dawn light, I was highly visible.  It has these little silver nubs in the back (see picture), not sure what the intent of those is but the felt cool while running.  If you adjust for size this is a great shirt."
5.0,LOVE! I am not a dress wearer but wanted to try some comfortable everyday lounge dresses to give my guy something different to look at.. but I tell you I was very happy with dress you can wear it as a lounge go  grocery shopping dress or you can dress it up and go on a nice date dress. material on the cream looking one is excellent. its not too thin not too thick. stretchy material It does look like some of them are made differently so material may be different on other colors so.. I HAVE ALREADY ORDERED ANOTHER IN WHITE TO SEE IF IT LOOKS AND FITS THE SAME. I AM 5'3 ABOUT 220 NOT A LOT OF HIPS OR BUTT (SAD FACE) BUT I GOT ENOUGH LOL... AND I GOT A LARGE IT FITS NICE ON ME NOT TO SLOPPY OR DROOPY . I was going to wait til I took pics in it to do review but I love so much couldn't wait. because its a perfect summer dress for me because I don't do too revealing clothing
5.0,Good value need to order size larger
5.0,The sunglasses shipped quickly and my Granddaughter loved them!
5.0,"Very cute shoes. My daughter wears an 11 in tennis shoes and I ordered an 11 in these and I would say they are about a half size to a full size bigger. You can't tell at all they are Velcro. She hasn't worn them yet, but they seem to be good quality. They arrived quickly. I would gladly order again."
5.0,I need Bifocals when driving and the segs are perfectly placed for my eyes.
5.0,"I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I received no other compensation.  All opinions are my own.  I have to say I absolutely LOVE this brand of tee shirt.  This company has the best designs in the world, ESPECIALLY if you're a cat lover (like myself).  I opened this shirt in front of my niece and nephews and they all loved it!  We've decided that instead of Captain America, this design should be called Kitten America!  I have to admit, this shirt is a little too small for me right now.  I ordered this shirt knowing it was way too small for me right now just to have...I'm trying to lose a little weight and I think this is great motivation!  Anyways, my youngest nephew actually wants me to look and see if I can find this shirt in a smaller size for him...which I'll probably do some time today.  He loves Avengers and all things super hero related, but also loves cats like me...so this shirt fits him to a T!  I ordered the XL.  I'm typically a 3XL or 4XL shirt, so I didn't even attempt to put this on yet.  I did note a few things, though.  First, this shirt has an awesome design.  I think anyone could enjoy the humor in this shirt.  Second, this shirt is lightweight and I think it would be great for summertime.  I don't think I'd recommend this shirt for cold weather but that's okay because it's a tee shirt.  Third, this shirt does seem heavy duty.  I feel like this shirt will withstand many, many washes and still look great!  There are no loose strings and the stitching seems pretty sound.  Overall a very, very nice shirt and I would DEFINITELY buy again!  I cannot wait to see if this company ever decides to make big and tall sizes."
5.0,The fabric is soft. It's not as long as the picture shows.
5.0,"I could do without the white ring with another substitute, and the green ring could be a little darker. I workout a lot and these rings have held up well so far over the last few weeks."
5.0,"This charm bracelet is very nice, the clasp is good quality and designed to look like a charm. this bracelet will easily support 10 to 15 charms, you just have to be careful when taking off the bracelet or the charms will fall off. Mom loves it; I bought the Butterfly, Treasure Chest, Seahorse, Clown Fish, Blue Whale, Owl, Penguin, Heart Locket, Best Mom double heart charm, Star charm, and Hanging Princess charm what's great is I purchased all but two of these charms on the lighting round, even the bracelet was a lighting purchase, if your looking for to start a charm bracelet you can save a lot on the lighting deals. Oh! one more thing the variety of charms is ridiculously awesome they have anything and everything you could possibly dream of so happy shopping."
5.0,"very smart and useful design, my cell phone and laptop's power adapter could grid it then put in my package, nice!"
5.0,Love love love.  More more more.  I am 5ft 2.  Petite and size 4.  Fit perfectly.  Fit my daughter in law 5ft 6 and95 lbs perfectly and my daughter 5ft 4 130 lbs perfectly.  You get the idea.  I wore this with cute sandals and a crop top with some chunky jewelry and the compliments kept coming.  Need more colors!!
5.0,Beautiful with special scarfs. It is well made and it looks great.
5.0,I like them! I wish there was even more colors!
5.0,My six-year-old loves it!  Great for dance in the winter to keep her warmer.
5.0,Cute & sassy for my Halloween costume. They were the talk of the party. üòè
5.0,no fade keep its beauty
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:a5eebe84fbb65b664c364f69c8587377]] Muy bonito,  fresco,  suave y c√≥modo"
5.0,Not the style I was looking for but were very cute and good quality. I ended up returning.
5.0,Bought for a friend. She loves them.
5.0,Talla justa y de excelente calidad
5.0,"Nice watch, take showers with it, no issues. Looks nice. Very happy with purchase."
5.0,"A must have for all Beatle's freaks, like me."
5.0,"The only thing is that I didn't know that the post screwed on, but it's fine.."
5.0,"This stiletto is extremely comfortable to hold. The Long, thin point perfectly holds and pushes any fabric under my foot. I stopped using my finger and tossed out my seam roller after using the pressing end. I don‚Äôt know how this works so well but I would recommend this to everyone. I considered it a little expensive but after using, it is so worth it!"
5.0,Excellent. Everything as expected
5.0,"Made great earrings. I got tired of taking off my jewelry at night and put them since I have so many piercings. These are a good size,  comfortable to wear day and night and a good price for the quantity. Thanks!"
5.0,"Very nice fabric and prints. Well made, sooooo soft and comfy. I wash it by hand and dry it in a hanger in the laundry room, NOT in the dryer because might get all the static."
5.0,"Had to buy this clutch after my daughter then my sister got one.  I LOVE IT... the leather wears beautifully and it holds a lot of stuff even though it looks small. I highly recommend this bag if you are looking for a nice, leather cross body or clutch."
5.0,This ring is absolutely beautiful. Love the sparkle and it doesnt sit up that high on my hand. I bought it as a secound ring to wear while at work I handle alot of chemicals and I dont want my real one damaged. This ring doesnt look fake at all to me. Like some rings scream fake this one doesnts. Came in a really nice strong ring box too. Also my hands swell alot due to my RA and this ring is true to size I have very small fingers at a size 5
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted!  Strong, yet feminine. Every time I look I my wrist, I am encouraged with HOPE!"
5.0,Perfect fit even for a big head. No excess material above the crown of the head. Super warm and comfortable in the lining. Just perfect.
5.0,"The size is just what I was looking for. It's a very pretty red, a little bit more subdued than the picture. The stitching on my wallet looks better than the stitching on the one in the picture. The wallet makes a crinkling sound when you handle it -- that's the material that blocks the RFID signal. I didn't realize that this wallet has two zippered compartments -- the one on the back of the wallet and one inside. The only concern I have is how well the leather will wear because I've had my wallet only a couple of months and I can see the indentation of my credit cards starting to appear on the leather. Nonetheless, it looks great and has tons of space for all my stuff."
5.0,"It is beautiful blouse! Fits me well! For size reference I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù , 112 lb and wear size Small."
5.0,Pence is a little big like it typed it was a small was not small  but it is OK I like it I like the clothes  Color and a long coat thank you very much have a great day
5.0,"Perfect fit, perfect medium weight - my honey loves this robe!"
5.0,Its very pretty just a little tight in the bust area but i'm a double D. Otherwise lovely evening wear.
5.0,"Great pair of Capri pants, was well, no fading"
5.0,"When I find a dress on Amazon, I first go to the size chart.  The measurements vary significantly from company to company.  It fits well, is very flattering.  To help all of those who do the same as I do, I'm 5'4"", 170 lbs.  I bought a large.  It comes well below my knee.  I took 4 inches off when I hemmed it."
5.0,"Bautiful, looks real."
5.0,"Great fit, great colors."
5.0,Fabric is pretty heavy. Worked for a rare cold day in Florida. The pattern was fun for the Holiday. I was pleased
5.0,Perfect size and exactly as described. Second time purchasing from this company.
5.0,Love the thermal. I would buy more but they ran out of MED size.
5.0,"Great materials solid, I LOVE THE WEIGHT. DELIVERED ON TIME great company would buy again."
5.0,Love this sweatshirt ! So comfy and fits perfect
5.0,"Definitely recommend shorts come in the right size, the picture prints definitely last, they do not fade and neither does the shirt itself."
5.0,Washes great and fits great!
5.0,I‚Äôm a new user of a C-Pap and it was causing my hair to have static electricity and breakage. This soft cap helps keep my straps in place and the two problems are gone.
5.0,Great look and very fresh
5.0,Love the slippers
5.0,love it perfect to me
5.0,Good Product and Seller!
5.0,So sweet and simple
5.0,Heavy but veri pretty and good quality
5.0,I love this necklace!! So beautiful
5.0,"Surprised by the good quality of the fabric. It is well made and sturdy. I would recommend this for sure. I personally think it's on the pricier side for a silly hat, but it's worth it."
5.0,"Nice light  weight comfortable cotton knit. Wash cold water,  gentle cycle,  toss in dryer for a few minutes and then hang to dry.  Ironing is not necessary.  I live in Dallas and it gets hot! I can wear this with a fun necklace and run errands."
5.0,"Great Style and material. I will be ordering more. I've bought others, and none were like this one. Exactly as expected!"
5.0,I love this shirt. Ffg its perfectly!
5.0,"Got these in and they look fantastic. The legs are a little shorter than normal boxers, which I wanted since my son runs a little warm and I want something cooler for summer. the only thing is I did the general size guide and these are a bit bigger than the other size 6 picked up from another brand.<br /><br />So if you're interested, buy a size down."
5.0,I bought this for my friends daughter and she loved that it was rainbow and pink. The mom liked that it was simple but cute and he daughter could still have a fun time.
5.0,Such a fun and adorable hat! I can't wait to rock this at the Kentucky derby next weekend!! Love it and love li arrived so quickly.
5.0,"Between my daughter and myself, we have 5 of these robes in various lengths.  Neither<br />of us use the zipper.  They are so roomy that we just flip them off and on over our<br />heads.  The construction is very good -  no raw, ugly seams.  The fabric  is soft and<br />wears and washes very easily. They are very light weight but keep us very warm and<br />cuddly.  Neither of us have one with the hood but I am sure it would be very warm in the<br />winter.  I wish the sleeves were about 3"" longer for my ""old age"" arms that get cold at<br />times.  The robes that are the oldest still look fresh and fairly new.  They have not<br />faded at all.  They have not ""pilled"" of shredded.  Overall, I shower, get dressed,  and<br />cuddle up in my chair, and enjoy the world!"
5.0,Arrived promptly. They'll compliment the pin on the gown I purchased for my grandson's wedding.  I may have to use a barrier on the posts to prevent any reaction. Sometimes silver isn't as friendly to me as gold.
5.0,"My husband loves how these are fully lined with sherpa from the waist to the bottom of the legs. He hasn't worn them too much indoors because he gets overheated. He loves wearing them outside when the frigid temperatures hit & he's snowblowing the driveway. If you're a guy who likes wearing sweatpants, I recommend you try these out as your winter time sweatpants. You'll stay super warm!"
5.0,"Size up! I normally wear an XL, but ordered a 2X based on other reviews, and the 2X fits as an XL normally would. Very comfortable!"
5.0,Very cute set
5.0,I bought these for my son. They are very comfortable socks. We will purchase again.
5.0,I really like this  jumpsuit is nice and comfy and fits well
5.0,Beautiful. Found no fault and loved the price. Took longer to receive it but worth the wait.
5.0,Love them! I've had foot surgery and these are the first high shoes that don't hurt! I bought black and now I'm buying the gold. Great wedge shoe for the money!
5.0,"Be prepared to be stopped. Once you have this watch on your wrist, people will stop you. They will see it and be intrigued, because it isn't your standard off the shelf watch. You'll tell them it's a wooden watch. ""Really?"" Yes, wood body and wrist band with a slick metal clasp. They'll say, ""What a beautiful color."" Yep, not the typical black, blue, red, or yellow plastic body or silver, gold, silver and gold or black metallic watch. Wooden watches allow for a different pallet. Now you can have gold, white, or red oak, walnut browns and mahogany. It allows for a different accent to your wardrobes.<br />""Wow, you can see the insides."" Yes it's a skeletonized automatic mechanical movement. Tell them you can wind it and normal wear will only require a couple of turns each morning when you put it on. If you just wind it up and set it down, it will last about 40 hours. I prefer mechanical watches. Two flavors here, pure mechanical (you need to wind them up all the time) or automatic (the movement allows for the movement of your wrist/arm to add power to wind the watch a little. You still need that extra couple of windings each morning, but you eliminate the need for batteries or the rage now to remember to plug the watch in at night. My boss's Apple died in the middle of the day because he forgot, bummer.<br />You get to show the structural strength of the watch, the quality of construction, and the weight; so light you can forget it's on your wrist. But look at that gold plated movement. They'll look and be amazed at the balance wheel move, or if you flip it over, the rotor flipping around to wind the watch.<br />This watch, sold by GAUNKE (they're a great vendor), is a simple automatic and very low cost. By that, I mean it has no complications. Complications are those things like adding the date, day of the week, time of day (a separate 24 hr. dial or showing the moon or the sun), or stopwatch function, among the most common. Those add cost because they make the watch ""complicated"". The other thing is the manufacturer of the movement. Movements are made in numerous countries with the primary ones being China, Japan, and Switzerland. However, you can get movements made in Russia, Czechoslovakia, France, the US and more. Don't let price sway you, though. There are good movements made by many places and many of these movements are based on designs and patents from other originating countries. But keep price in the back of your head with the thought of what am I using this watch for.<br />The watch in this review from GAUNKE is an every day watch. The movement is Chinese and there are no complications. Provided you never get a watch like this next to a magnet, it will last a long time. I have many other watches, in different price points, some with complications, many without, and with movements have been made in different countries. This watch is perfect for the intended use, everyday at work.<br />I just wasn't prepared to be routinely stopped and have to talk about it."
5.0,My husband loves this shirt and can wear it to dinner (we live in Hawaii) or to work on Fridays. It's a tad bit see through but barely noticeable.
5.0,"I've had more compliments on this thang any other of my &#34;budget watches&#34;. You can't beat $25 bucks here and it's tough to find brown color schemes that actually look good.<br /><br />It has a simple, modern look and the face is well designed.  Outer casing has more of a gold finish with a hint of rose. Not what I expected, but it helps the watch not be &#34;too brown&#34;.<br /><br />Medium to large in size, bigger than my Nixon and Peugeot, a touch smaller than my Deisel. Fits and wears well.<br /><br />Very happy with this. Price lured me in, quality and finish will get me to buy again!"
5.0,"Got this for my nephew for his 8th birthday, he loves it."
5.0,The Zephyr Adult NCAA hat is a perfect fit.  The hat's stitching is secure and the hat is well made. I would highly recommend.
5.0,Hard not to buy every one of these beautifully made (really really well made) pretty things. My wife is always so darned happy.
5.0,"I love this shirt.  It is soft and warm.  It is a little snug, but it will work.  The sizing on these shirts are a little difficult to determine which size you should order.  My suggestion is to read the other reviews as several stated their size (height and weight)  and which one they ordered and how it fit."
5.0,"I'm 5'8 190lbs and 38C. Fits really comfortably, not too clingy. It is a bit on the short side,  right under butt cheeks."
5.0,"I like t-shirts which are a little larger than the average for it's listed size. Nice thick material, good colors, quality print."
5.0,"It's a little shorter than you think it's going to be, looking at the product pics, but once it's on it looks great and it's sooooo soft and warm!"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! Nice size also. Makes a wonderful gift.
5.0,"Very pretty, looks delicate i have wore it in shower, swimming and holds up well"
5.0,Fave earrings
5.0,Ordered for my Father. Came faster than expected. Great packaging. Love the watch.
5.0,Great product. Fit nice to my wife as expected . I recommend
5.0,"I love this style because they‚Äôre more comfortable to wear to bed. These particular ones are a little weightier than a normal tiny huggie, but I love the design. I wore them to a wedding."
5.0,I used it  For a t shirt .
5.0,"This scarf is really soft and comfortable. Even though it says the length, I still expected it to be a little longer since it says ‚Äòlong scarves.‚Äô This is a normal length scarf I would say. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô tall and it‚Äôs a good fit, it doesn‚Äôt hang down very far. None of that is a negative, it‚Äôs a good length and warm with a nice pattern on it. I noticed some reviewers said it‚Äôs thin, I have a few scarves that are similar thickness and are plenty warm for me and I live in New England. Just wrap it around and it is nice and cozy. The fabric is mostly polyester with some wool so it should hold up pretty well, but I suspect it will start pilling over time. It‚Äôs price point at ~$17 seems about right."
5.0,My dad loves it.  He wears the crap out of it.  Purchased the  white cream color with soft green palm trees and it's perfect to for looking festive but not too festive everyday wear.  You know what I mean.
5.0,"I like the colors, the logo and the stretchy material."
5.0,"Although not a coat that will be used for very low temperatures, this is a surprisingly warm coat. I wore it in the high 30s outside and it was warm enough for me and the inner lining blocks the wind pretty well. The quality of the stitching is pretty good and it seems to be of high quality. The color blue that I received is very close to the picture and it looks pretty good no matter whether you are dressing in jeans or slacks. As far as fit goes, I am 6'1 210lbs and I ordered the XL which fits perfectly. This will be used often when it is around the mid-30s at night and 40s during the day which is a large portion of winter where I live."
5.0,Exactly what is advertised
5.0,Love the graphics and color of the red mini on gray shirt. Giving as a gift to a mini owner.
5.0,Great deal. Nice microfiber bags for safety glasses.  Fit regular sized safety eyewear just fine and protects them well.

5.0,Amazing. Big fan of LBJ going to love these.
5.0,"Soft material for the glasses, the glasses are a good fit.  The lens are a little bigger than my previous pair."
5.0,"I've been using these nursemates socks for about 5 years now and i have never had any issues with them whatsoever.<br />I've been using them since my first clinical as a LPN student, now graduated RN and they are still the only brand i trust.<br />I started wearing the black ones since the white nursemate socks i had at first ended up getting stained because of my clogs, but i have no issues with these black socks and they're not noticeable underneath my white scrubs which is always a plus.<br />The compression is perfect and i do notice when i don't wear them as my legs start hurting near the half-end of my shifts.<br />They last quite a bit too being machine washed and in the dryer. (5+ years so far!)<br />Also i'm a shoe size US 6/6.5, muscular calf and they fit perfect.<br />Shipping was fast and item came as described, in a pack of 3, worth the buy."
5.0,Beautiful color and size
5.0,"Item in good condition, very pretty but the string didn't last me that long."
5.0,Love these! I am female and don‚Äôt like the standard small silicone for the gym. My first shipment was lost and the company quickly sent me a new set. Love them for the gym!
5.0,"""GOOD for the Jews!"""
5.0,I like this very much plenty of room and compartments for eveything you nedd
5.0,Perfect! Nice light weight and awesome screenprinting!
5.0,"It fits perfect...cant tell from original lens and has clear cool sight wearing these , definitely will recommend to a friend!"
5.0,"I needed a bag to take to Europe with me. It‚Äôs the perfect size, holds just the right amount of things. The quality isn‚Äôt the greatest, I have a feeling it won‚Äôt last under lots of use, but for the price it was worth it. The only con is the zippers on the flap pocket kept splitting open. That pocket is pretty useless, but it was still a pain to look down and see the zipper opened when it‚Äôs not even in use."
5.0,Look and fit good!
5.0,So far so good. I was my hand a lotttttt and have not had any issues. Glad I gave it a shot. And my wrist is very small.
5.0,Product was just as pictured‚ù£
5.0,"Belt looks good, fits good. I order a size 38 and wear 36 pants, it fits good, 2nd notch from the end and I could go down 1 more. So order 1 size up from pants' waist size. I have only worn it three times and it looks and wears good."
5.0,"Very nice, but has a fishy smell."
5.0,"These are really pretty earrings, what a gorgeous blue.  I was extremely happy when I opened the box.  They look way more expensive than they are.  If you have long hair, consider wearing it up with these.  When the crystals catch the sunlight.. just beautiful."
5.0,"My feet are size 8 1/2 regular width. I'm not overweight so I have no extra padding on my feet. These are wonderful for when I just want my toes covered in my shoes. It makes them more comfortable and more sanitary than totally bare feet in closed toe shoes. I can wear them all day long with no slippage or discomfort. I can also adjust the little heel strap up or down depending on where I want it in a particular pair of shoes. It stays put. I'm very pleased with them, more so than I expected I would be."
5.0,"Comfy, fits well. Haven't washed yet, but will always wash in cold and delicate and lay flat to dry as this fabric will most likely shrink."
5.0,"Love it , use at dog park to keep track of my 2 dogs"
5.0,My husband has cancer and these seemed to be a good addition to his well being.  They are good quality and nice looking
5.0,Looks good and most importantly very comfortable.
5.0,Awesome hat. Fits and looks great. Will probably order a second. Great purchase
5.0,After an 8.5 hour shift  still the best workshoes I ever got
5.0,"Nice, quality gold, wonderful stone, opal"
5.0,BEST  RING I  EVER HAD
5.0,I liked it!  First day wearing; I had compliments on it.  I love the how it expensive it looks. üòâ
5.0,Beautiful quality swim cover up. Fit as expected. Shipped in a timely manner and looks great on. Would definitely order from this company again.
5.0,Grandaughter love love loves it.
5.0,"My 10 year old absolutely loves this top and she looks so cute in it!  The quality is great, the material is soft and it launders perfectly (despite saying hand wash).  It is her new favorite top!"
5.0,"This is my 2nd pair and I like them for fit and comfort. They dry quickly and no sweat getting two swims in a dry suit twice daily. The elastic in the waist band gave out in about a year, but I swim indoors at a club in the winter and put the suit in one of those water extractors, I think that is the elastic problem."
5.0,Fit is perfect I am 5‚Äù3 and 146lbs got a size medium.
5.0,My clients are loving it
5.0,"I love it, so cute and comfy. I get lots of compliments."
5.0,I bought it for attending air shows ... and it is perfect! The extra long visor compensates for having to elevate your head most of the time ... and the prop feature is a big hit with aviation buffs due to its' prop shape! Great price too!!
5.0,Very cute and good quality. Getting a lot of compliments for it.
5.0,I bought this for my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day. It‚Äôs very good quality for the price. It‚Äôs pretty and delicate.
5.0,It fits like I expected
5.0,These are the best masks I have found and I have many of them .  The extra fabric that has been placed on top and bottom makes it fit your face. It is like a custom made mask. I give it a 10.  I just use it when I am out in public.
5.0,"I bought this to wear under my dress at my daughter's wedding.  I wear a 14 sz dress and the XL fit beautifully.  I found this to be the perfect balance of comfort and support.  The material was soft and breathable and while providing adequate support did not constrict or make me uncomfortable while wearing it.  It required effort to get on but the material definitely stretches and gives enough to make it possible.  It did not ""ride up"" and was the perfect length as well.  For the price and the quality this item was a great purchase for me.  HIghly recommend and will use this piece in the future!!"
5.0,Very stylish and comfortable.
5.0,The mask looked great on my husband.
5.0,Came just as pictured and is really neat.
5.0,Great product I love this ring
5.0,"My granddaughter, age 12, picked this out on her Christmas wish list.  I bought it for her and she loves it!  She was so excited when she opened it.  Well made.  Definitely a good buy."
5.0,"I never like cardigans w/out buttons..hanging open..so I ordered this to keep my sweaters closed! Perfect for what I wanted, and besides, it's beautiful!"
5.0,"This is my new favorite sweater! The sleeves are long, but I actually like that. Really comfy, not heavy or hot at all, just a normal medium/but mostly lightweight cardigan. Color is a light grey like you would get in sweats, true to color and size."
5.0,Somehow I'm always reminded when I put it on we are all connected. I see things as they such be. Omen..ciao'
5.0,"What a nice little wallet!! The leather is like soft suede, supple and a beautiful color. It exceeds my expectations by leaps and bounds. My husband LOVES it. Only down side is there is not a whole lot of room to stuff crap in like my husband does, as it is slim. But he plans to use it when he doesn‚Äôt want to carry his stuffed wallet. It has plenty of slots for credit cards and you could fold up some money to stick in a slot. He said he can just throw it in a pocket to run out on errands. C"
5.0,Look great fit great she likes them
5.0,"Bigger than expected, decent quality. Good for holding quarters."
5.0,Was so excited prior to getting this item. Once it arrived the packaging was in good shape and inside was a velvet little sachet not a tiny one either. Very nice that can be reused.  Inside the sachet were the earrings all in individual packages.  These earrings are not the cheap earrings that you will find in a dollar store.  Very heavy and durable. I instantly pulled two pair out and put them in my earrings and haven't taken them out since. I love the look and the fill.  I will definitely buy from Jstyle again.  Thank you!
5.0,Lovely bag.  Not too big.  Adequate and neat.  Bought it for my Mom - she loves it.<br /><br />Diane S
5.0,Took a little longer than expected to arrive but happy with them
5.0,Got here as promised
5.0,"I ordered two of the pink tutus for my granddaughters.  They are adorable, the pink color is great and I love the sparkly stars on them."
5.0,Wife loves the comfort of wearing the earrings and the  blitz
5.0,"Very attractive and well fitting.  Fabric is a stretchy synthetic that keeps its shape, not flimsy."
5.0,It's good quality and looks good . I bought 5 instead of 4.5 and fits my son right
5.0,absolutely beautiful. light weight and flows nicely. perfect for twirling. will be a great summer stress and will lake nicely with tights and a cardigan for fall.
5.0,My granddaughter wears a different pair every day.  She loves them.
5.0,My husband is very happy with these neck gaitors.  He said they are very comfortable and breathable.
5.0,"Super cute and comfy. I wore it for a long day of walking, and it was perfect. I am 5'3, curvy/athletic build, and I got the Medium."
5.0,"I've been looking for a bag like this for a long time.  I initially saw a bag similar to this in a boutique type community in FL and the bag was very expensive.  I just couldn't justify paying that price even though I loved the bag.  I finally found this bag and when it arrived it was just what I wanted.  The quality is great and the size is generous.  Order this bag, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,Adjustable so it‚Äôs great for women with small wrists! It‚Äôs beautiful!
5.0,"These are my new favorite gloves and will replace my old ones. TL;DR - BUY THEM<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) They are much more accurate for texting than my old ones were. I only had a couple of typos, which could be attributed to me.<br />2) They are quite soft and warm.<br />3) Very stylish, and true to the photos.<br />4) Fit well. I have average sized hands I would say (even though I am 6' 1&#34;) and I ordered the small and they fit perfectly.<br />5) Impressive packaging. The packaging is black, sleek, and minimalist. Not really a big deal if ordering for yourself, but it will definitely up the wow factor if this is a gift.<br />6) Real leather<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Real leather. The only reason this could be a con is that you probably don't want to get these wet.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount so that I could give you this honest and unbiased review.<br />ThomasBurgessReview.com"
5.0,"Good Quality, fast shipping."
5.0,"I've had this band on my daily-wearer Casio Diver for about a year now and it still looks great.  Putting it on was a bit tight like others here have said and it's best to use the spring bars that come with it because these are a bit bendable. I've never had any problems with the band coming loose.  The band is solid, easy to adjust and the release button works well.  It makes my Casio almost emulate the Seiko Diver(which costs in excess of $300). This band presents as very good quality and functionality and is a steal at this price.  I'd buy this again tomorrow if something were to happen to my present one. Highly recommended"
5.0,Good quality leather.
5.0,"The wine shawl, wrap in the unisize is so comfortable, soft fabric and it‚Äôs beautiful on. I am tiny and it looks great and I put it on my very large man friend to show him and it fit him great too!! Haha"
5.0,It fits my fiance's finger perfect and she loves it!
5.0,Super cute on. I wore this over a white crop top for a casual evening at an outdoor concert. Great summer staple!
5.0,"Work for me, need to read with 350 vision reader. I have a wide face and like clear fame due to blindness in left eye. Comfortable for long time use."
5.0,Better than expected... Super comfortable and flattering. Received compliments.
5.0,thank for a great product
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:104559dfefe490dea982936d59ee7a4]] Wow big hit. Kids are going crazy. Home run. Lights can stay on , blink slow or fast. Takes AA batteries sturdy mask, strong head strap . Long remote control line  Halloween üéÉ lookout!!! Highly recommended"
5.0,Love it. Sooo pretty. I have small wrists and with a gentle pull I expanded it slightly for a better fit. It's definitely not made for bigger wrists. Love that it matches my pipe cut stainless steel rings. The clasp heart and dangle makes it all the better.
5.0,Took a long time to get. Fit was great looks super cute on my daughter.
5.0,Hard to find smaller inseam pants . These fit my son great
5.0,"When I was young (dirt was just getting started per my Son) I had a pair of Sun Cloud sunglasses that I loved since instead of just darkening everything they also tinted to whole world gold or that is how I thought about it then.  Cut to today and when I put these sunglasses on they take me back to my Sun Clouds.  Not sure if true for other color lenses but the blue ones brighten the colors and contrast while still reducing brightness which is the ""gold tint"" from my childhood.  Simple shaped soft care case, lense cloth, and some banding materials fill out the what you get list.  Comfortable to wear while driving, working in yard, biking since the stay in place without a strap.  One note is they are ""large"" in that with arms closed they do not fit in my car's sunglass holder (pop down space near rearview mirror.  I have had several pairs of sunglasses and they all fit but these are too large.  Not a problem just something to note.<br />Have not had these long enough to know about the durability but then I never kept a pair of Sun Clouds long enough to know either so just liking the nice nostalgic sense when I wear these.<br /><br />*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!<br />**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Love this tank. The size small fit great. I love the fun bright color it's great for summer! Also very light weight
5.0,The boob area is a bit large but everything else is great.
5.0,Exactly what i was looking for at a much affordable price! Definitely recommend  ;)
5.0,"I love the colors of this kimono/cardigan! It fit perfectly; not too baggy, not snug. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs TTS. I have a 36 inch bust and usually take a 10/12 in dresses and bought the medium."
5.0,The only problem is no women sizes
5.0,"just fit perfectly, i order 1 size larger."
5.0,Wow I'm in love with this shirt looks pretty cool and sexy it's not really loose to be one size I weigh 138lb 5'4 so fit nice
5.0,So cute. Beautiful colors. Daughter loves it.
5.0,Beautiful dress a little big in hips for extra small
5.0,A lot of underwear for the price.  They wash and wear well.
5.0,"I love these glasses.  They are a little big for my son, but they are very comfortable and are the only ones he wears for a long period of time without trying to take off."
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet, I received it as a birthday gift and I absolutely love it."
5.0,The shirts are lite and the fabric is soft. My wife ordered a size medium based on the size chart and it's a bit snug. Aside from that great product.
5.0,"This ring is exquisite.  The colors are bright, beautiful and vibrant.  I was so pleased when it arrived and I will definitely be ordering more from this line.  Highly recommend!!"
5.0,If your guy is looking for a &#34;manly&#34; purple then this cuff link is perfect with a modern style twist.

5.0,Super cozy comfy and surprisingly thick/warm
5.0,Very sparkly!  I thought I wouldn't use the strap but it sure came in handy later in the evening.
5.0,"I love these shorts!  They aren‚Äôt transparent in the bum and they fit perfectly! They are nice and tight, yet my movement for kicking and stretching is not restricted.  I‚Äôm definitely ordering more of these!  Plus I love they have cell phone pockets!  :-)"
5.0,Quality piece....well worth the price!
5.0,I love the shirt and the price is  right Pretty shade of pink
5.0,"Nice thick leather that holds its shape. The spikes are evenly placed and fitted nicely. They fit my 5.5"" wrists with some slack, the choker needed to be adjusted bc I also have a small neck."
5.0,"The blanket scarf exceeded my expectations.  It matches a dress I bought of amazon and plan to wear it with perfectly. The scarf is well made, comfortable, not scratchy and beautiful.  It is not super heavy on my neck but definitely keeps me warm.  It was very reasonably price for the quality so I plan on buying a few more In different colors.  It‚Äôs a great way to add some style to your wardrobe without spending a fortune."
5.0,My daughter loves this ... it really does look nice on!
5.0,Loved it! Size 8 - I‚Äôm 165 pounds and 5‚Äô4.<br />So comfortable and cute! I will buy another one in another color for sure!
5.0,Love these!! wonderful to sleep in with it's light weight slinky fabric.
5.0,This is my go to earring and it has kept its shine and looks great each time
5.0,"I'm 5'3"" and 34""/27""/34"" and the size 6 fit great! The belt slides through a single loop in the back and isn't attached so you can wear the pants with or without the bow in front. I don't feel like the photos quite illustrate this, but if you're at all familiar with ""paperbag"" style pants and shorts you'll know the hip/crotch area becomes a bit poofy/slouchy when you put them on. I love the stretchy, cinched waist - I have a long torso with shorter legs so I feel like high-waisted things help make me look a little more proportional. They hit right below my ankles when I'm standing and a bit above if I'm sitting. The pants have a nice beige almond color that's most accurate to the last, close-up photo of the product.<br /><br />I expected these pants to be a stiffer material, so I was surprised by how soft and comfortable they are! If you like wearing or even just FEELING like you're wearing pajamas around all day, you'll love these. The quality is great - no VPL, loose threads or unfinished hems here."
5.0,So comfy and soft but not so thick you‚Äôre sweating to death. Love the print too!
5.0,Great Christmas stocking stuffer at a good price!
5.0,"She loves them... so excited,, called me as soon as they arrived,,, she makes sure to charge them and uses them with ease,, just may have problem holding charge if you use very busy pattern and very bright colors."
5.0,"Soft, easy to wash, great quality"
5.0,Finally found a mask for masquerade prom theme that would fit over his glasses!!
5.0,"Material is smooth and comfortable, it fits well, hangs well and looks great!  I would recommed this to anyone interested in getting one."
5.0,"This is a bargain for this price! I ordered this in grey and got it in Medium. I am about a size 6/7 and it fit's wonderful! It's so cute being backless, gives that sexy appeal. And the straps aren't constantly falling down your shoulder's as many do. This is a great pick and considering the price you just can't beat it!!!"
5.0,Earrings were exactly described! Thanks!
5.0,Cute as well

5.0,Looks expensive but its not!  Great buy!
5.0,Very comfortable and cute. Very lightweight fabric. I just bought a second pair.
5.0,"When I first received the earrings, which came even earlier than expected, I saw that the silver cones did not match and it was too noticeable to keep them as they are a gift. When I contacted the seller she immediately looked to see if she had any more  like<br />these and she happened to have one that was a match. She sent it out right away and they are perfect. Great experience!"

5.0,great value for your money!
5.0,These are good quality slippers for the price. The inside is very soft and I like that it has a rubber sole so my son can wear them outside if needed. My son wears a size 6 toddler shoe and I ordered the size 5/6 dinosaur slippers for him. He won't wear these long but for $9.99 I can afford to get him a bigger size when he's ready. I'd buy this brand again.
5.0,Just love this unique necklace!
5.0,They are small but perfect for my daughter who is 13!!!

5.0,Perfect as advertised
5.0,I study the size charts before I buy any clothing online so this one does run small. I am 5'5&#34; and about 150lbs I usually wear between medium and large top (bust is 40&#34;) and 9/11 in pants (hips are 39&#34;) I ordered the xxL and it fits perfectly. Believe it or not top and bottoms fit perfectly!! I love this suit and can't wait to wear it. And the price is amazing for what arrived. Swim suits are so expensive lately. I figured if it wasn't great the price was very much worth the try. It delivered pretty quickly even earlier than expected and arrived in store equivalent condition. The only thing lacking would be the hanger!!<br />The bunched material hides my squishy midsection!! I'm 50 yrs old so I was looking for something classy and perfect for an imperfect body type!! I had read that this type of suit fits my body type best. I tried it on and instantly loved the way it fit.  My husband loves it too. I feel like this was an awesome buy!!<br />Definitely take your measurements and go by the size chart provided by the seller. I have not washed the suit yet so I'm hoping it will wash well. If it doesn't I'll update this review. If no update then it's still perfect!!
5.0,Love these colors and very comfortable
5.0,"Beautiful earrings!  The length was just right, and they worked perfectly for the event."
5.0,I liked that it fit my husband who wears a 2XL shirt.
5.0,"They are a little too big for my extra large 2 year old, but he will grow into them."
5.0,Kind of impresses with this for the price. Bought this for my husband because he is gonna cosplay as a mashup of joker. He is crooked teeth and the little metal tabs in the back are adjustable! We haven't done the mold yet. But I'm impressed. I'd get this if you need a grill!
5.0,Delightful. I love this shirt. Polyester is THE WAY.
5.0,more beautiful than a picture
5.0,My daughter loved these. Was on her wish list.

5.0,Fit is perfect. The colors are beautiful and the top is light and comfortable.
5.0,Loved this set. Great for family pics!
5.0,I rarely buy clothes online because I like to try on my clothes to guarantee a good fit. I used the size chart and it turned out to be a pretty good fit. I am usually an XL in US sizes and I ordered the 3XL. I like the material and the design. I wore it all day and never felt uncomfortable. I would recommend this product.
5.0,The item arrived just as described and are perfect for young girls! I will be using them to ask 3 little girls to be flower girls for my wedding.

5.0,"Love this bracelet. It's cute and well made. I have a tiny wrist so it's almost too big for me even at the last clasp, but not a big deal. Don't hesitate to get it."
5.0,Just right size. Pretty
5.0,I'm in love üòä with this product its exactly as pictured...I cnt wait to show it off on my wedding day ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫ thank you
5.0,"Love them, thanks"
5.0,Works great god as Liftmaster. Very simple to program.
5.0,"I was so unsure based on reviews what size to get on this one.  I'm a 38 C, Size 12, sometimes 10 and the large was perfect...even a little roomy! The quality is amazing for the price.  At 5'6&#34; the skirt comes just below my knee and my elbows are covered.  The neckline comes a little below collarbone so more modest women might want a sleeveless shell, which sits very well underneath.  The skirt is very flowy so if you aren't into that it might not be your thing, but this dress works so well for me! Very feminine!"
5.0,Nice glasses. Wasn't sure If polarization was going to be an issue and it wasnt. Best by far that I own.
5.0,"great helmet great quality, very happy with purchase"

5.0,I have ordered the protectors especially for my wedding in July and they are fantastic! i am lokking forward to wear them on bracks
5.0,very good built quality
5.0,I really love this product and take it to the beach and pool with me every time I go. I am glad I followed the sizing guide in the pictures of the product and NOT the one that Amazon provided where you select the size it was completely different.

5.0,Never received.  The 0ackage came open with nothing in it

5.0,"I bought this laptop bag as a gift for my daughter-in-law. I did not want to break the packaging until I handed her this gift, so I inspected it only externally. I liked this bag. It is for a large computer, very roomy, with a satin lining, very stable when standing on the surface. In general, for my taste, this is an elegant bag for a business woman. I will try to update my review when I find out the opinion of my daughter-in-law."
5.0,I wore this dress for our kindergarten family party. My students and their moms loved the dress. Many moms asked where I bought it. I believe it will be a favorite for years to come.

5.0,Very cute bracelet üòÄ

5.0,Fast shipping. Great product!
5.0,"I ordeeed<br />A small inthis but accidentally received a medium. I absolutely love the sports room, it's so cute. I emailed, and immediately was responded to and had a new sports bra sent to me within 3 days free of charge. I was beyond inmpressed with the amazing customer service and the prices are very very reasonable for a great quality item. I highly recommend them! So cute clothing!<br />Shannon<br />5'3, 115 lbs- athletic build"
5.0,Fit great! Has lasted a long time. Easy to clean.
5.0,Comfortable and good quality mask.
5.0,"Love the way this shirt fits! It's a little thick, so it's a bit warm for summer. It washes well, and does not shrink or lose its color! Perfect shirt."
5.0,Love these. Just right for everyday.
5.0,"Beautiful pendant, looks very expensive."
5.0,2 identical pair came in the packaging. Socks are comfortable and come just below the knee on my 10 year old. Would purchase again.

5.0,Cute. Goes great with my jogger jacket
5.0,"I ordered this dress for my daughter in college, here is what she had to say about it:<br />This dress is so cute! It fits perfect and I love that it is not too tight on chest (I was worried about this since some online dresses are tighter on top). The length is perfect and form fitting with ample room to breathe. I have received many compliments on this dress because of how good it looks in the back and how unique the sleeves are. The sleeves cut about halfway up the arm and make for a cute, fancy look for any occasion. Really recommend this dress for anyone thinking about it."
5.0,Love these shoes!! So pretty
5.0,I love the material this purse is made of & it has a lot of pockets.  I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0,It's GREAT
5.0,This pajama is really cute and light for warmer days! Fits well!
5.0,"Super cute, I bought for my niece,  she has not tried yet."
5.0,Love my handy reusable bags.  They hold a lot more than I ever thought possible from groceries to electronics to personal items.  My best friend tried to steal my Elmo bag lol.  I need them to come back in stock so I can purchase these bags for her birthday coming up in August.  I always keep my bags in the car never know when you might need them
5.0,"Not too tigh but tight enough, very breathable :)"
5.0,So adorable great price shipping was fast I love them forever thank you
5.0,"It fastens with a velcro strip, stays up and fits as expected. Only complaint is it is described as a towel dress but the material of actual dress is a water resistant cloth that doesn't dry at all. Would buy again."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! Arrived on time too!
5.0,Very long and very warm. Worth the money.
5.0,"Beautiful necklace.  Because if centre from China, it did take a long time to get here, but it is a very nice statement necklace, especially for the price."
5.0,Tried these out and loved them. This is my second order. I keep them on the nightstand for late night kindle reading.
5.0,"Love these laces, they look nice, they are good quality. I definitely recommend"
5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for. I saw this in a store but saved $41 buying from Amazon! It arrived in 2 days and was packaged nicely in a pretty box. Prefect for gifting. This is a short necklace with extender perfect to wear against the skin inside the collar of a blouse. Very happy!
5.0,Love love love this suit! I bought it for a trip to California and was nervous about the bottoms being a bit to &#34;cheeky&#34; but they were comfortable and fit amazing! The top is adorable and the light padding is helpful for us flat chested chicas!
5.0,Very flattering. Love the material very comfortable! I bought these for leg days and was hoping they were squat proof and the company is 100% honest. The outside package said 75-80% squat proof. That is the honest truth. They will work just fine for leg days but you will feel better wearing lighter underwear. I still love them.
5.0,"Cute piece, lots of compliments"
5.0,"Very soft fabric, I ordered a XL and it fits just right. It's not to big or to small. It's perfect with sandals for a hot summer day or wear with a denim jacket on a cool summer night.  I am going to order another one in a different color."
5.0,"I understand this is for a girl and I am woman. Locker situation isn't the best work, I'm using this as ""fanny pack"" at work.  If you are a girl or petite woman this is perfect.  Not a good crossbody for me because I am bigger.  I love the design and colors... Especially all the pockets."
5.0,great look and quality. would definitely recommend
5.0,Love these!  They say on!  They keep my toes from being rubbed raw in my summer shoes but they aren't super thick to cause stretching of my shoes either.  These are great!
5.0,7th BD present.
5.0,Excellent compression socks.  The best I have ever worn.
5.0,"Really good, it fit perfectly. Now all my shoes are with a clean and cool style."
5.0,As expected. Worked well.
5.0,Great fit perfect for hikes in the warmer weather.
5.0,"I LOVE this sweater! It‚Äôs extremely warm, not at all itchy and the knit isn‚Äôt seethrough like some sweaters can be. It‚Äôs long enough to wear with leggings but looks great with jeans as well. Can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. I went back and bought more in other colors. 10/10 would recommend!"
5.0,"I'm getting used to wearing earrings again after leaving them out for some time. These studs are pretty, but since they don't have flat backs, I don't care to wear them all the time. The hoops, however, are great to wear all the time and give me a break from just studs while I get used to wearing something regularly again. The hoops are made in a way that allows them to sort of feed into itself so they stay put and it works well, even through sleeping in them. They also seem to keep their color through showers and haven't left any skin discoloration. I've worn them a bit and like them so far."
5.0,For the price I Love it . It wears a little easy bit 100%%% worth the money. I‚Äôd buy again .
5.0,Good quality & absolutely love the pockets! I had a coupon for them or I probably wouldn't have spent the money
5.0,My 10-year-old absolutely loves this shirt.
5.0,Love it! Perfect size!
5.0,Love the way these fit and feel! Will definitely be buying these again.
5.0,Purchased as a gift for a teenager - very pleased with the product. I would recommend this item to consumers.
5.0,Awesome!! It‚Äôs a bit wide instead of long but looks good.My daughter ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ÄòS  Very pleased: side note it does smell but most products from China do have a smell for shipping purposes. It washed out
5.0,"I made my purchase based on the reviews. I was looking for an outfit for this upcoming Valentine's Day event. I have prime so it arrived in a timely manner. I am 5'4 and 192 lbs. I got a large and it fits perfect. The inner liner prevents the sequins from scratching or itching my skin. I love the vibrant red color. I normally would have bought a dress, but I wanted to change my look. I love these pants. I also found matching shoes on the Amazon website and is wearing a white top to complete my look."
5.0,Little girl now has new 'favorite' dress
5.0,"Beautiful dress, soft and comfortable material."
5.0,Great service and product!  Looks great with my glasses!
5.0,I loved it! It fit very nicely. The colors and designs were beautiful! Received lots of compliments on this top.
5.0,This ring is elegant and reads of subtle class. It fits beautifully and goes with so many articles of clothing incuding jeans or dressing down. An excellent accessory in any wardrobe.
5.0,"This coat is great! These are lightweight, very protective against rain, and super cute! My boys dragged me outside and made me spray them with water the first day we got them. They love them!"
5.0,GOOD ITEM  BUT NIKE IS PRICEY
5.0,Looks great. Very pleased.
5.0,"Warm, pretty, great texture, figure flattering"
5.0,"Kind of like a muscle tank, but more feminine. Great for working out or going on a hike. Light and breathable. I haven't washed it yet so I can't say how it will hold up or if it will shrink. I hope not! If it holds up, I'll be getting more colors."
5.0,These are awesome.  I didn't realize the peace of mind I'd have by attaching these to some of my most important items.  Got a clear case for my phone and have the dynotag sticker underneath. It's nice to know your stuff could find its way back to you if need be.
5.0,So cute and we'll made
5.0,Excellent quality!  Adults & kids both wore for party.
5.0,My daughter was super excited to receive this as a gift and show off to her friends.
5.0,"Cute and reasonable,add a sparkle to your outfit!"
5.0,If you would like a pair of Moccasins that are made well and have some protection on the sole at a decent price... these are the ticket.
5.0,The earrings are  big but surprisingly light! I couldn‚Äôt even feel them in the ears. He green is very rich and vivid and pops very beautifully. Lovely and festive earrings!
5.0,I like these rings and they are cheap to buy. Good quality
5.0,My boot heals wore out during covid while everything was closed so I had to do some diy. How hard can it be to re heal your boots....? Well not as hard as you might think! A little glue some new rubber soles and a few tacks and you‚Äôre good to go! These things worked perfect! Now that things are opened back up I can get it done professionally and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be perfect but I gotta say for a diy I think I did pretty good!
5.0,Really easy to work to with. Just ordered another pair!
5.0,"My husband really like them,  color,quality everything perfect."
5.0,"These are beautiful garnet earrings, just the right size for me. A deep dark red that goes purple-y in some light."
5.0,"Have not washed yet but so far perfect fit.  Small, 5‚Äô7, 137lbs.  Good Room in arms and chest, tighter fit around waste.  Nice look just like pic on web site."
5.0,Perfect fit true to size looks exactly like the picture very good material doesn't feel cheap makes me feel really sexy can't wait to wear it for my birthday on my trip to Miami
5.0,My gf and I love our necklaces .
5.0,"Ordered this passport holder in vintage brown and it looks and feels amazing. I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband and I'm certain he will like it (even though he prefers darker colors!). I chose this vintage brown color because I read a review on here about how it's always so easy to ""misplace"" your passport or think you lost it because of how dark it is and it blends in with the carpet, your suitcase or clothes.  The vintage brown is light enough not to lose it but still dark enough to look modern and manly. I recommend this passport holder!"
5.0,So adorable. The band is stretchy and adjustable. I was worried about the knots slipping and the bracelet falling apart but I don‚Äôt see that happening easily.
5.0,cool shirt
5.0,This dress was perfect! Fit perfectly. Was as pictured. Well priced. Looks long in picture but only because I was wearing flats. I added the slit.
5.0,Its  a good looking sneaker.  Very comfortable!! I was afraid sneaker would be narrow.  I have wide feet and they fit perfect.
5.0,Love this beautiful special occasion purse. Glad I purchased it!
5.0,The fit is great. I'm 5 10&#34; 160 lbs and went with a medium. They could be slightly loser around the waste but nothing to complain to mama about. I like the back pocket as well for slipping my wallet in to run a quick errand. The fabric feels nice and heavy so great for mild Texas winters. 5/5 would buy again
5.0,Excellent service  and  Beautiful selection
5.0,"This product was great overall, but the straps were a bit too long."
5.0,"Got it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. It‚Äôs so unique and unlike anything we‚Äôve seen. It fits very comfortably on him, and looks very elegant."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! Very clear blue stones. The price is right. Shipping was very fas
5.0,My son loves this. He is only 6 months old but I turn it on the colors when he goes to sleep. It's in the corner of his crib and he falls asleep with it on. I turn it off before I go to sleep. I love how it changes colors.
5.0,This is sooo cute and so comfy but it didn‚Äôt match the Allegra K cheetah print top. It‚Äôs 2 different shades.
5.0,Perfect for my daughter's smaller neck. Other ones were always too big.
5.0,I like these bands they were easy to install and they are good quality.  I would purchase this again. I got the pink and white and the gray and white they both look good.
5.0,Love this bag! I use my bag for work. I have a small laptop and papers that fit into it and still have room. It has 2 drink holders on the side which helps me out a lot.
5.0,Their perfect that's I Like !!!!!
5.0,"I LOVE this dress so much that I instantly ordered 3 more in different colors/patterns. I'm 150lbs, 5'4"", 36C, and the Medium fits absolutely perfectly. It would still fit great even if I lost or gained some wait. Low cut, so I would need to wear a tank under it for work, but otherwise it's gorgeous for any occasion and could be dressed up or down. It does accumulate a lot of static, so wearing a slip is helpful. Static spray or dryer sheets help too."
5.0,"Bought for my fiance' for Father's Day, I love it and am so excited to see his reaction :) the detailed pictured helped me decide on this watch over the Invicta to match mine."
5.0,Super cute! Normally with high waisted skirts I wear a large. I have a small waist (31) but large hips (47in). The material of this skirt is very nice - not see through or flimsy. It has a nice stretch to it in the waist area as well. I normally wear a large but had to order an XL only because the large was not in stock. With my shirt tucked in it fit nicely but it would probably be a little loose alone as a high waist and would sit lower. Definitely recommend!
5.0,"There are a lot of over sewn areas which had to be trimmed.  But for the price you cannot beat it.  I am 5'7"" and  wt. is 150 so it comes to about 2 inches above my knee.  It fits like a swing dress should.  The material is really pretty nice.  Not the same color as in the picture but overall it is a great couple of dresses.  I will buy again"
5.0,So much cuter in person!
5.0,Simply perfect and I love it
5.0,I ordered this bracelet to wear for my wedding coming up. It is gorgeous and I love it very much. Fast delivery!
5.0,"I purchased these boots for my husband to wear at work. He does construction and maintenance at an apartment complex and we have been searching for a pair of boots that are comfortable, yet durable, for him being on his feet for long days. He likes them so much, he decided not to trash them at work (he does everything there and his work boots can get pretty dirty). He opted to wear them out and about, and doing what yardwork we have been able to do so far (landscaping and prepping the garden for the planting that is soon to come, plus working in the garage, so everywhere except for work). I did buy a half size larger than what he normally wears because they did not come in wide, but he normally needs something a little wider due to bunions on both big toes. He said they are very comfortable and loves the look (hence not wanting to wear them at work). I am very happy with my purchase , especially because I am always skeptical about buying shoes online without trying them on first, and because he's so picky with his choice in boots."
5.0,"cotton nice,keeps everything in place nice,rides up a bit in rear not so nice,took for ever to arrive,a penalty for free shipping? all in all very satisfied and will purchase again if they hold up after laundering."

5.0,"A bit oversized for my kiddo who is 5 (ordered smallest size) but it's not problem. My kid LOVES this shirt and says it's very comfortable. He's super into tie-dye and Wild Kratts so this is the perfect shirt for him. He's happy, I'm happy."
5.0,I am really happy with this swimming suit.  First time purchasing a swim suit online and really happy with the fit.  I purchased the large and am currently a size 10 bottom and 36dd on top.
5.0,I really love the Crystal I have a lot of Crystal s but not on a chain.
5.0,Love the shirt will be wearing it for Halloween with my daughter  dressing up as WW! I am excited to say the shirt is really nice so I‚Äôll wear it more than expected!

5.0,Very nice fit with additional accessories.<br />Glasses were delivered on time in perfect condition. I would definitely recomend this glasses to anyone that liked that retro look
5.0,"I own this version of the bucket hat and another style. The Salute to Service version shorter brim and snug fit. My other bucket hat has a longer brim and has some room and sits fine. Overall, if you want a clear line of sight with little adjustment the Salute to Service hat might sit higher for those who have a wide head."
5.0,I LOVE THESE BRACELETS! I have BIG hands and wrists. Every single one of these fit perfectly. The colors are beautiful. I'll probably order another set.
5.0,"love this suit! i can't believe i got it for such a good price. i'm 5'7 and about 160lbs, large fit perfectly. good material. i ordered it in two more colors."
5.0,Add a photo or video
5.0,very well made!
5.0,Love it!! Fabric is very soft and is exactly like picture.
5.0,"Looks more expensive than it is. Beautiful material. I would have preferred longer sleeves, in order to avoid a kimono look; but overall, a keeper. Length fits great on 5‚Äô2‚Äù frame."
5.0,Love this dress! It‚Äôs a bit bigger than expected but definitely not noticeable to others. I received a lot of compliments.
5.0,Item shipped fast. Great quality! My boyfriend loves them! They helped relieve pain from his flat feet and plantar fasciitis.
5.0,I really like this belt. It goes with a lot of different outfits
5.0,Very pretty setting and color. The silver with the blue really stands out. I really like the earrings a  lot.
5.0,I like this graphic tank top. The saying is perfect and it also fits me  perfectly.  I like the fact that it's longer and easily covers the top of my jeans.  The arm holes fit great too. Often times they are large and show a bit of side boob.  This didn't.
5.0,Fits well. Good quality
5.0,I like this product because it was inexpensive and it identifies me as the captain that I am. No longer am I mistaken as a non-captain.
5.0,I have this bag in both colors and I like the black one better. It's roomy and pretty.
5.0,Just one beautiful bow tie.
5.0,"The watch is beautiful, light weight, well made, comfortable and the diamonds sparkle. I enjoy wearing it morning to late evening."

5.0,"Love this dress! It‚Äôs a little big on top, but it‚Äôs not super noticeable. I also had to use a safety pin on the slit because it was a little high for my comfort level. Lovely dress, and pretty comfortable too!"
5.0,"These are great googles, first season using them.  They fit comfy, rarely fog up, and look great.<br />The dark lenses do not work on snow days so make sure to have the lighter lenses to change out.<br />Visibility is not an issue.<br /><br />Very pleased with these."
5.0,Very cute on my granddaughter
5.0,Very quality and comfortable hoodie.
5.0,Nice gift for my mother in law.  She loved it.
5.0,"I ordered this one and a blonde/cream colored one. I‚Äôm very picky about my attire and accessories. I was impressed with the beauty of the 2 scarf rings. They won‚Äôt work with the thicker scarves, but with silk, satin, or other thin material they work wonderfully. I recommend ordering the larger sizes. I definitely recommend these beautiful wooden scarf rings to others."
5.0,"True to size very soft absolutley adorable and I love it, love the bell sleeve and it's exactly what I been looking for!!"

5.0,These are quality clip-ons that fit just right. Very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend.
5.0,Great for the gym. Very comfortable. Only complaint is zipper at the top of my left pockect where the end of the zipper is hidden in the fabric pops out. Guessing the stitches that hold it in came loose. Everything is of a good quality. Probably just a isolated incident.

5.0,Great dress!!
5.0,"I needed these, as I have a large knuckle and thin finger. So easy to add to my ring while on my finger. Now my beautiful diamond stays put. Easy to remove, also. I also use an adjuster on an eternity ring, as to resize it would change the ring style. Highly recommend."
5.0,"This is not the true leather that I was thinking it would be, but looks nice nonetheless."
5.0,"We were looking for a heavier V-neck sweatshirt for hubby.  He loves it so much it's in the wash every week!  I'm buying more today.!! It's sad that it comes from the UK, but when a person can't find or get what they want in the US....."
5.0,I liked this Cape it was a last minute purchase to complete my outfit I got alot of compliments on it
5.0,"I love this dress!! It is so cute and flattering. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 175 pounds, and the large fits perfectly. It is a very slimming cut that is very forgiving on my postpartum belly :) It hits the waist and hips perfectly. The neckline is great too. Fabric is nice quality. I‚Äôll definitely be ordering this in another print!"
5.0,"These aren't &#34;fine jewelry&#34; but they really are quite pretty anyway. They aren't overly blingy but are nice and elegant with a lovely bohemian feel. I bought them to wear to a wedding but I see myself wearing them a lot otherwise as well. For the price, they are really quite nice!"
5.0,"perfect fit. Bought it when I was in my first trimester. Even though it's not a maternity dress, it complements the body shape so well. I'm at my third trimester now, and I still wear it. So comfortable, and the pockets are a great plus!!"
5.0,Love me some Stance socks! Hard to go wrong.
5.0,A little buckly on the sides but fits well. Is very comfortable.

5.0,very nice. Better than the Ferragamo original
5.0,"I bought these for my mom, she tried on her size in a store but they're were too tight, so I bought her these a couple sizes bigger she said it helped her on her 5hr flight."

5.0,Had boughten 2 in different sizes for 2 granddaughters. Was perfect
5.0,"The veil is lovely in person. I was concerned at first that it would be too stiff as it did not relax and lay/flow like I was hoping. I put it over the shower rod, turned the water on hot (pointed away from the fabric), and closed the door. About 20 minutes later, it‚Äôs absolutely perfect!"
5.0,Satisfied with my purchase.
5.0,"Bought this shirt for my Mom, was a little pricey, and was concerned the material wouldn‚Äôt be soft enough for my Mom is is recovering from surgery and radiation. It‚Äôs so hard for her to wear shirts because she‚Äôs burnt badly under her arm pit and all her shirts seems dig into her armpit and hurt her. This is perfect for her to unbutton under her armpit area and also casual enough to finally go out in public. She wouldn‚Äôt go out because she couldn‚Äôt find comfortable clothes."

5.0,I first ordered the nightgown for my granddaughter and her doll and while looking for that I saw this and I knew I had to get this as well. She opened the pj set first and was thrilled. Then I gave her this wrapped up and when she opened it she started jumping up and down screaming. She loved how soft it was and she modeled it around the room. She absolutely loves it and is still thrilled to wear it months later. Big score for this grandmother!!

5.0,"This is a well made wallet and looks good.  I love the color because it is easy to spot in my large black hole of a purse.  It has enough compartments to hold my cards and cash.  While it is not cheap, I think it was worth it and will probably last a long, long time.  Great purchase."

5.0,"Fun shoelaces, just as expected."
5.0,"I love this necklace so much! I got the February Iris version, the one with two chains. The necklace is chunky enough where it doesn't look out of place with higher necked or less fitted tops, so it can add a little femininity to shirts that are oversized or boxy. However, it's still nice enough that you can wear it with a dress or really anything else.<br /><br />The two chains are separate, so you can wear them by themselves if you'd like. The floral pendant chain has a loop right in the middle of the back where you can hook the paperclip-style chain into it. I LOVE this feature, since it keeps both chains perfectly centered all day. It also ensures that the floral pendant chain doesn't fall off if it comes unhooked (which mine generally does a few times a day). I normally wear the paperclip-style chain on its tightest setting so that it's offset from the pendant chain by a little bit (see picture). Occasionally the floral pendant gets flipped around, but the back is hammered gold, so it actually looks nice no matter which way the pendant is facing. Those two things (pendant chain coming unhooked and pendant flipping around sometimes) might bother some people, but for me it's not a problem at all. This is my new favorite necklace since it looks good with just about everything - so happy I got it!"
5.0,"I love it! The chain is thick and the gold is not dull. The chain is not heavy either, it's very appealing."
5.0,Made a perfect gift üåª
5.0,"Beautiful, comfortable and sexy dress for date night! Fits amazing, hugs in all the right places."
5.0,Buffs are consistent in their wear and usefulness.  I love all the ones I have purchased
5.0,Very nice graphics
5.0,"So cute, fit perfect. Tucks in my problem areas. I am 5'4&#34; and these did not run far past my feet as some jeans do. At first I felt like they fit tightly around my stomach and made my fat accentuate, but I feel like next time I put them on, they had perhaps loosened a bit, because now they look gorgeous and are not too tight."
5.0,"The necklace came nicely package to avoid damage during shipping and it is beautiful.  I broke the chain on my diamond pendant a few days ago and order this as a replacement.  I'm glad my other chain broke!  This is dainty, beautiful, and a good price.  Shipping was super fast!"
5.0,Great anniversary gift.<br />My wife and I just celebrated our Tin Anniversary (10 year) and I bought her this.<br />She loves it and has received several compliments on it.
5.0,These are super large and super light!! So happy I bought these. I recommend them to anyone who loves a good hoop earring.
5.0,"This hat more than meets my expectations, a superbly constructed hat constructed for summer, I was a little suspect when ordering but this is one hell of a hat, I predict it will give me years of service & happiness"
5.0,"Ordered these masks for a bachelorette party & they were perfect!  They are made of cloth, so much more comfortable than some hard plastic on your face. And we got compliments everywhere went!"
5.0,It's beautiful gift for my granddaughter
5.0,Very cute! Fits my big head just fine.
5.0,"AWESOME!  HE ALREADY HAS 10 BELTS, SO I WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER ONE SOON."
5.0,Super cute dress! Love it
5.0,"After browsing through Indian Motorcycle jackets that aren't leather I decided on this mesh jacket because I like the appearance and the branding.<br />When it arrived the first thing I noticed was the weight. The material is a little thicker mesh than some of the mesh jackets I have had in the past. With a removable liner it's obviously lighter.<br />The zippers feel durable.<br />The XL fit is comfortable. Not binding or too loose. (I am 6' and weigh 195lbs, chest 43.5"")<br />Cosmetically the colors are vivid, stitching looks durable, and the branding is well done.<br />A surprise was the heavy duty hanger that was included.<br />I normally don't buy branded jackets and don't spend this much on motorcycle jackets. I am impressed with this jacket and feel it's money well-spent for a motorcycle jacket that will get plenty of wear on hot Summer rides."
5.0,"Just a little too small, my mistake. Good product though!"
5.0,"Exactly what I expected, good quality, great price"
5.0,"really cute, look great on me"
5.0,Exactly what my son was looking for.  Made a great Christmas present.
5.0,"I wore a Casio F-91W watch in the 90's and I loved it as it fit perfectly under a dress shirt but also worked so well as a casual watch, and it was indestructible.  It never needed a battery and kept perfect time for many years.  Eventually the band broke and by then, my cell phone told the time and I stopped wearing a watch.  I got back into watches 8 years ago and I now have a small collection.  I had completely forgotten about the F-91W until I saw it online recently.  Wow, Casio has been making the same watch since 1989!  It is new and retro at the same time.  I ordered one as soon as I saw it and I absolutely love my new one.  It is 1990 all over again and the price of nostalgia was a mere $12.  It is smaller and lighter than I remember (but that is probably because modern watches are large and heavy).  It is a pleasure to wear as most of the time I forget I have it on my wrist.  You can pay thousands of times more for a watch but this is all you need if you just want a dependable watch that will accurately tell you the time.  Everyone should have a F-91W in their collection, no matter if you only own one watch or you own a thousand.  It is an iconic watch for less $ than you will spend for lunch."
5.0,which they had more colors
5.0,Sealed like it‚Äôs supposed to!

5.0,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas, and she really likes them. They are cute and a good price."
5.0,Beautiful nicely made scarf.
5.0,Perfect addition for the Speed Cart. Provides additional storage and carrying capacity.
5.0,Perfect product very comfortable

5.0,"I bought this hat for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!  The little star wars symbol on the side is so cute and the Darth car or lettering looks nice. This hat also has a good feel to it, not sure what the material is but I like it better than other hats. Also, it is not tacky looking like some star wars stuff. It's just right! I def recommend buying this hat for the star wars fans in your life!!"
5.0,Very cute watch band! Colors are vibrant. Band fits as expected and is compatible with my Timex watch face.
5.0,I'm approx. 5'5&#34; and 165ish and ordered an 8.  Looked and felt awesome in this number.  Would definitely recommend!
5.0,"True to picture, very lightweight"
5.0,worked well.
5.0,Great shirt.  My husband loved it.  Package arrived on time.  Thank you!
5.0,"I love Patty Boutik clothing.  The quality is quite good, and the fit is very flattering.  I am 5'7&#34;, 140 lbs, and I typically wear an 8 or a medium.  I ordered a large in this dress since their clothing runs a tad small, and it fit perfectly.  I have never had a flat stomach even at my leanest of times, and I find that wrap dresses help me to camouflage this nicely.  If they offered this dress in other patterns that I liked, I'd definitely order another one."
5.0,I love how they fit! Perfect for canceling out the glare!
5.0,"These are great, makes putting on shoes easier.  If I had to say a negative, maybe they could just be a little tighter."
5.0,I love this!!!!  I had put the wrong review here about shoes.  I love this bag. I use it everyday for work.  Michele A
5.0,"Real cute, but too small.  Had to past it on."

These laces are a life saver!!!"
5.0,I am absolutely in love with this dress!  It‚Äôs so comfortable and shows off my figure in all the right places.  Definitely getting it in different colors!
5.0,I have very thin hair and have a hard time keeping headbands on my head without them flying off.  This headband fits perfectly and I don't have any problems keeping it on.  You can wear it as a thick headband or fold it and wear it as a thinner headband.  The material of this headband feels very soft and stretchy.  I love this headband!<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for a honest review.

5.0,Stunning I would buy it again!
5.0,Got several compliments and looks much more expensive. Tag says 100% silk
5.0,right fit
5.0,"It‚Äôs cute, airy, not see through . Definitely an empire waist vs natural waist. I‚Äôm usually a size medium dress or 8/10 because of my bust, so to play it safe, I got a large. It‚Äôs perfect, not baggy at all. I thought it would be longer than it is though. Everyone was noting that it was dragging on the floor, but it‚Äôs hitting just the top of my sandals. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù , 150, 34D, athletic."
5.0,"Arrived very quickly, very cute shirt, graphics are good, runs a little small. I typically wear a 1-2x but I should have ordered a 3x."
5.0,great size for a rugged men's wedding band

5.0,Perfect for running or working out where sweating is involved. Helps prevent chafing and absorbs really well
5.0,It‚Äôs so cute and light material. It has a pouch for a filter. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it.<br />I bought a couple for my sisters.
5.0,Exceptional piece of jewelry. I bought this for my significant other and he loves it. The chain is nice looking and sturdy. I have to say that the gold and silver(titanium steel)together really look sharp on him. The eagle is well made and the writing is clear and not blurred like some biker jewelry. Well worth the price.
5.0,We visited New Zealand and bought some wool/possum blend gloves. They were lightweight but very warm. This hat is the same. My husband loved wearing it while shoveling snow during cold winters in Indiana. I would highly recommend purchasing this hat!
5.0,"Great belt, love it."
5.0,"I bought the burgundy scarf & it came in 2 days on amazon prime. It did have a little chemical smell when I opened it, but I washed it twice in the washing machine & let it air dry. It is so soft, no more smell & looks great wrapped twice!"
5.0,Came just as advertised!
5.0,My daughter loves to ‚Äújump in muddy puddles‚Äù as peppa pig says. She wears these around the house all the time.
5.0,Silky nighty fits perfect
5.0,I was really pleasantly surprised! I thought it would be too short since it was &#34;one size&#34; which is usually either hit or miss but I feel as though this can truly fit multiple sizes. I am 5'8 and it comes to about mid thigh. The material is soft with a slightly grainy feel and it comes with a matching gstring which you'll obviously see through. The lace up top was really nice and stretches with the strap going around the neck leaving the back open. I am in love with this one and although I received it at a discount I am buying another color!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review for which I am not obligated to leave positive feedback.

5.0,Love the quality and adjustable straps.
5.0,"These are the thickest warmest fleece pajamas I've run across. Great! I ordered XL because I'm 6'2"", having shrunk from 6'3.5"" in my old age. Their XL is practically a tall, being almost too long for me in the sleeves and pants. Having a 36"" waist, I can't say how much the waist might expand, maybe to 42"". They seem well put together, with a great shoe lace drawstring and a one button fly."
5.0,"BEAUTIFUL DRESS , GREAT VALUE"
5.0,"This is just what I needed to protect me from the sun's rays when I'm watching an outdoors event.  Haven't tried it in the rain, but I'm sure it will work.  Easy open and close.  Not as easy getting it back in the sleeve, but not a big deal."
5.0,Super cute matching set! I bought this for my niece who is obsessed with unicorns and American Girl dolls. She absolutely loved the idea. The material I‚Äôd good quality and it fits true-to-size

5.0,Very good quality lots of room for credit card. Love it
5.0,Absolutely love this dress. I bought a medium and I'm 5' 130lbs. Fit is slightly load but still looks correct and not as though I'm in a size to large or anything. It's comfortable. Top cotton and bottom a linen feeling fabric. Will buy in more colors.
5.0,"Fits very well, stretchy enough to be comfortable but still has the leather look. I can wear it with almost anything."
5.0,"Estos zapatos me encantan, la combinacion de colores es lo mejor!"
5.0,Purchased these for my wife. Was looking for a nice modern design with a light blue tone. Topaz stones are clear with smooth cuts on them. I would clarify they color as swiss blue. Prongs and clips are sturdy.

5.0,Great quality and price! Fit my 1 month old.
5.0,My daughter loves it. True to size and great soft material.
5.0,"This has turned out to be such a versatile dress; I have dressed it up with pumps for the office, some nice jewelry for dinner out, and worn it casually with sandals. No matter how I've worn it, I have received compliments :)  Oh, and it drapes nicely, packs well, and launders like a dream (gentle cycle / cold wash / hang dry). No doubt about it, this dress is rapidly becoming a favorite of mine (so much so, I just ordered 3 more in different colors). An amazing dress for the price!"
5.0,It was what I wanted
5.0,I wanted a small purse that I couldn't lose things in. This bag does the trick. I only keep the necessities in it and that's about all that will fit!
5.0,"Being a baseball nut, I have collected some pretty impressive jerseys but had thought prices were too high for the cases.  Found these at a price equal or less than lowest price elsewhere (and I trust Amazon) so I finally ordered.  They came faster than promised and were exactly what I wanted."
5.0,Extremely comfortable bra. Bought 4 of them. Wished I‚Äôd bought twice as many. They are fabulous and at a great price!!!

5.0,I'm 5'2'' and weigh about 107 lb. I bought a size m. It fits me perfectly. It has a fun feel once it's on.

5.0,"Very nice, the product looks just like the image. This item would make a nice gift as well. Definitely worth the money"
5.0,Kids were so happy to see dad in this flamingo costume. Good part about it that you don‚Äôt need to put it all away. It‚Äôs stays on your waist like pants and your upper body is not covered in it.<br />Costume is easy to put on and inflates quickly.

5.0,For lounging and sleeping
5.0,"I didn't buy from this seller- got it at a tourist beach shop. But it is a ""solartees"" shirt. So this is just a review of the product itself. But these shirts are great. We got each of our kids one on vacation & had no idea how / if they would actually work. They change colors when you go out in the sun (black & white indoors). I accidentally dried both of the kids shirts after washing and was so bummed I thought I had ruined them for sure- but they are still trucking! They have been through the wash about 5 times and dried 3 times. I have washed on warm and cold and normal dry cycle and they still come into full color out in the sunshine. Love these (prob more than my kids do).<br />Update- my youngest got a hand-me-down and after being in the attic for 2 years it still works! These shirts got washed & dried a bunch of times, then put in the attic for two years and they still look awesome. Great quality product."
5.0,"I take a size 9 1/2 mens shoe, and this fit well.  Too cold to ride here in Wisconsin, I will post again after wearing it on the bike."
5.0,Great seater! Love it. Colors are as on the picture except for the brown which is more kind of a Bordeaux
5.0,My little girl was over joyed when she got this.
5.0,"Absolutely love this, I‚Äôve never liked night gowns because they aren‚Äôt comfortable to sleep in but I‚Äôve slept in this numerous times and it never bothered my and its sooo comfy!"
5.0,"The oil can was perfect for my daughter's play the Wizard of Oz.  With a bunch of middle schoolers using it for weeks of rehearsal and two weekends of plays, I wasn't sure it would hold up. But it has and still looks great.  It's made of sturdy material and the level to squeeze to dispense &#34;oil&#34; never gave out. I would definitely recommend it."
5.0,I got this for my boyfriend who has a thin frame and this is tailored to fit a slim frame.  It accents his broad shoulders and thin waist.
5.0,My daughter got these for Christmas and loves them. They're soft and comfortable.
5.0,An excellent choice as a defensive weapon against those who wish to steal your credit card information. The cases come in many colors. I gave them as Mother's Day presents and the recipients were quite delighted. Enough slots for their cards. They were sent immediately with no problem.
5.0,"Well made, daughter was thrilled with it colors are more on the vibrant side verses pastel in my opinion. Would by again, she received many compliments on it when we were out running errands. :)"
5.0,"I love to dress up in a variety of different looks.  Many of them vary from boho to goth, or steam punk.  This skirt is a unique color in this line of clothing, so I got it.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />This is a skirt made from lyocell and viscose.  Traditionally that used to mean eucalyptus and bamboo, but there is some conflict as to whether these two types of fabric are a process and not content.  In other words, you can have either one be anything including polyester. In this case, this wrinkles VERY easily, so I am apt to think of rayon and perhaps the natural type of lyocell.  It has the flow of rayon and is quite drapey.  If you don't like wrinkles be ready to iron this a lot.<br /><br />COLOR<br />I would call this a blue teal color.<br /><br />STYLE<br />In order to get the style you see in the photos with this skirt listing, you will need an underskirt.  It does not have to be tulle unless you want it to stand WAY out from your body.  A rayon underskirt with a bottom ruffle or two looks great with it.  I especially like it with a cream or off white underskirt.  Under that, I like to wear a regular slip as it keeps the skirt from catching between my legs on windy days or hotter days when the fabric likes to stick.<br /><br />FIT<br />I wear a size 14-16 misses US and this fits a bit snug at the waist but it still works. If you like it baggier, go up a size.<br /><br />POCKETS<br />This does have pockets in it which makes it nice for festivals and events.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great skirt.  It has a lot of possibilities to dress it up or into cosplay directions.  Be prepared to iron.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS, but I wish it ran a bit larger in the waist.  The elastic is a bit on the smaller size than other XL skirts of this type that I have worn."
5.0,Very comfortable to wear in this fall weather and the overall material of the shirt is very soft and breathable.
5.0,"I needed something to help my glasses from slipping off my face. Looked at quite a few items and decided on this. I received today.  I put them on and just amazing.  I have to remove myself now, they do not slip, slide or fall off when bending over. I barely notice or feel them. Very lightweight and easy to put on. I have had them for 5 hours already. Brilliant little helper."
5.0,"Awesome!  Dark lenses,  fit is perfect."
5.0,I love this bag. I got the blue one with the brown handle. It's quite large and tends to get a little heavy by the end of the day. But I love all the pockets. it's has great organization.
5.0,"My MIL loved it! It's very dainty and simple, but beautiful."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for everyday wear around the house and like the variety of basic colors.
5.0,"These socks are super cute, and you can't beat the price for a pack of 12 socks. I love the colors and designs, and the material is soft. They seem to be high quality, and wouldn't be surprised if they lasted for years. The 1-3T are still too big for my 7 month old, but she has plenty enough time to grow into them."
5.0,"Comfortable sox, my legs feel much better."
5.0,Excellent quality. I put them on all my hats
5.0,"Super nice!  They are soft and were true to size.

5.0,Perfect size and great quality!
5.0,These glasses are well made for the price. They brighten your view and fit over prescription eyeglasses. I particularly like the flip-up lenses. An added bonus is that they don't cancel out the heads-up display in my car.
5.0,Hat is washable
5.0,Love this dress!!!!
5.0,This thing is HUGE! But I love it. Received lots of compliments about coverage from the sun. Not good with large crowds in close quarters.
5.0,I am constantly in search of things I can wear to nurse in. I'm tired of not wearing dresses so I figured I would give this a try because why not get an entire outfit for $29? It fits really well! I'm 5'5&#34; 125 lbs size 2 usually and about 34D depending on how full the ladies are at the moment and I got a Small.  It covers well at the chest but can pull aside easily for nursing. The material feels a little cheap (don't expect Lilly quality for this price) but it doesn't look cheap on and is not see through. What new mom doesn't love a flowy long dress for summer?
5.0,"Shirt fits great, very comfortable material. Will buy again in differant colors"
5.0,Fits well and it‚Äôs very handy it has pocket for filter. Just what I need.

5.0,Just as advertised. Arrived in excellent condition. Too bad there's no place for change.
5.0,"Comfortable but not sloppy. You can style up or down, as needed."
5.0,"After gauging my ears up to 1/2 inch, I had metal plugs in. The plugs have to be cleaned consistently. These silicone plugs you don't have to worry as much about keeping them clean, but I still recommend to clean them frequently. They're light, easy to put in, and you can't even tell they are there."
5.0,the cloth is excellent
5.0,Cute fits as expected
5.0,They are exactly what I expected. True John Lennon sunglasses. They have a nice heavy frame. I think they look too funny on me so I'm giving them to my granddaughter.

5.0,Bought this dress for a photo and wasn‚Äôt disappointed I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 130 and it was a bit loose but the belt fixed it  I bought a medium for fear of small being too short and it worked out great
5.0,"I'm a big guy and hate when big shirts fit small.  The 3XL fit perfectly, just as 3XL should"
5.0,I love these skirt cover ups. I bought one of each.

5.0,My chi chis a lil big so it falls a little bit when they jiggle a lot but nothing double sided tape cant fix. It's a really good product and I love it!

5.0,"I was going to a masquerade party and needed something quick, classy and unique. This product was the perfect solution.  I received several compliments and was able to ‚Äúdoctor ‚Äú them up for and added twist.

5.0,"Love my bag, orginal with tags.  It was shipped ground came in 2 day's.  Will buy more in my future purchases. ."
5.0,Nice light weight necklaces
5.0,"In AZ it gets pretty hot so these are the greatest!  This royal blue is very rich. If you think it's too low cut just get a stretch lace bandanna, which I do with certain dresses, It actually adds to how pretty these are and for the price Unbeatable! For me  I'm looking for fast, easy, cool and Pretty!"
5.0,"Great boy short. Gives coverage, but this still has a somewhat sexy look. These are not granny panties!  I am out of the thong stage :-) but do love these panties: provides a utilitarian, comfortable pant while still cut in a youthful manner. They do not show VPL (visible panty line) with leggings or jeans. A bit on the pricey side, but if you wash on cold, delicate cycle and hang to dry, Calida will last a very long time."
5.0,This product came early. And it's the best climbing man ever...I got many compliments and got in love with it!!
5.0,True to size and great quality!

5.0,My daughter (13) ordered this for herself and is very happy with it.

5.0,they keep my feet cool in hot weather making my shoes more comfortable.
5.0,So cute and so soft! This is so much cuter in person! I bought the pink one for myself and the caramel color for my sister and we both love them. I found them to run true to size and was very happy to see that the sleeves were long enough even for me at 5‚Äô10‚Äù and long arms.
5.0,Beautiful fit and color.
5.0,"These are some of my favorite pants, and the best I have found on amazon. They are super soft and very comfortable like a skirt. I bought and use for my Kundalini yoga practice but they are amazing to wear anytime. I get compliments and like I mentioned before, everyone admires the softness!"
5.0,Awesome socks
5.0,Love this belt!  True to size.
5.0,"Great idea, wore these in a marathon"

5.0,"I bought these after breaking my prescription sunglasses. They have been everything I wanted them to be, I am very pleased. I will buy more."
5.0,"I recently had cataract eye surgery was in need of magnifying reading glasses.  These are perfect, the bifocal section is hardly noticeable, they are not a distraction when wearing,  they are comfortable.  I did think they would be &#34;red&#34; framed, but they are more tortoise shell.  They have a lacey print on the side of the bows, make them trendy.  All in All a good choice for what I need them for."
5.0,Ordered this for Christmas.  Exactly as described!  Kid specifically asked for novelty socks and loved the design!
5.0,"These socks were exactly what I wanted! Fit was great, quality was as expected. The only issue to note is that they snag like any pair of tights, but the toe reinforcement is great to prevent snags at the toe."
5.0,I bought these for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves them!
5.0,It was a wonderful birthday gift.
5.0,These earrings are super cute and the quality is good.  I'm 5'10 so I tend to wear big earrings and these are just right - not too big and not too little. I've worn them every day since they arrived lol!
5.0,A great buy. The Isabella is close to perfect. It's just a little small for my taste but everything else was wonderful. I've had a lot of compliments on it and I do recommend it.
5.0,Very nice dress. Has a little room for stretching.
5.0,Fits good and is super cute!

5.0,"I got a size x small. I am 5'3"" and 115 lbs. I love these shirts! The fabric is thin, breathable and soft for summer time. The pastel pink color is very pretty but slightly shear. The others are not shear at all. I bought them in several different colors because I love them so much!"

5.0,SO comfortable. wear them around the office.
5.0,"So much better than the rubber ones that come with the Fitbit! I have been using this band daily for several months now and it is really holding up well. High quality, especially for the price! It is aging well, and I get lots of compliments on the leather. Highly recommend!!"
5.0,I Brought this watch band as a second band to were . It is very sturdy and secure band easy to clean. The only dilemma I have is that I sweat a lot and still it does not slide very well made. I highly recommend this item.
5.0,"SPELLING IS FIXED!<br /><br />I just got this ring, and read all the reviews about the spelling errors, but to my pleasent surprise they are all fixed!!!<br /><br />This ring is flawless.  I thought for ten bucks it would be cheap or weak, but its not!!<br /><br />The ring in the center SPINS!!!<br /><br />The stainless is polished to a mirror finish.<br /><br />This really is a great buy, even if you just put it on a chain and wear it as a necklace, its very high quality."
5.0,Bright lights easy to use soft face mask as expected
5.0,Very cute. Looks well made
5.0,Great quality and it looks like it can take the punishment of holding my jeans...a little joke. But my experience with this seller was great and I believe that I will get more from this seller as soon as I ca buy one more belt as backup. Excellent service!
5.0,These shoes really help with my knee and black pain.
5.0,"I have a few pairs of stud earrings that feature Loki's helm, but these are my favorite. The helm is clearly defined, the earrings are shiny and are more noticeable.  The quality is excellent for the price (~$10 as of this writing). One minor complaint is I hate the backs they come with, so I just used others I had.<br /><br />Highly recommended to Loki fans."
5.0,I will be purchasing another one for my Black Panther Costume in the future so thanks!
5.0,I love this bag! Awesome quality for the price and the color looks just like the picture. Perfect for carrying a bunch of stuff to work with me!

5.0,It is pretty as it looks on picture.
5.0,"These sunglasses appear to be well made and I expect them to last a long time. They were a good value and fit nicely - I have received several compliments on them, which is always nice."
5.0,"Wife liked the pair I bought her, so she wanted a few more pairs. She gets cold easy and she said they keep her warm."
5.0,Fit perfect!! My ponytail can come outside hanging
5.0,"These are the best no show socks that I've owned. Super soft and comfortable, no awkward seems, and they truly stay below my flats without them slipping off!"
5.0,"This is one of my new favorite pair of shades.  I was looking for a cheap pair of shades to replace another cheap pair I use for biking and running.  These actually feel quite premium.  They're comfortable and easily adjustable.  If you have a round face this looks really good.  I won't use these to workout, but for casual wear in the sun.  I think they're that good.  Oh and their customer service is soo good if you have an issue.  I didn't have an issue, but they are pretty generous in what they would do to make it right."
5.0,Cute comfy and easy to install
5.0,"This is an awesome t-shirt for those sweet baby girls with no hair. Everyone seems to call them ""cute little fellas"" without knowing that they are actually little girls. This shirt stands up for them, and tells them ""I'm not a boy!"" Perfect baby present for your friends! Fits most babies newborn to about 3 months of age."
5.0,"I have been looking for this kind of belt for years. Used to get them at golf stores but they don't carry them any more, just the stretchy kind that I don't like. These are  also a good width for most shorts or jeans."
5.0,Beautiful vibrant colors. I can't do it justice in my photo. Very comfy for a beach/ pool cover up! Light weight. Runs small! I usually wear a 2x and this is a 3x ..
5.0,"These pants are EXTREMELY comfy and light and just AWESOME!! Perfect for pjs or like many of us these days, work attire for working from home!!!!! I have purchased several for myself, my mom and my daughter!!"
5.0,"These are so cute that I ordered several more of these for close friends, and for my sister's. They will make cute gifts."
5.0,Bought these for a mental health support center and they loved them and they really lifted their spirits
5.0,The fabric pattern is delicate and feminine and the fit is casual and easy.
5.0,I have Oakley turbine prescription glasses and I wear them all day. The sleeves fit snug and prevent my glasses from digging into my ears.
5.0,"Love this dress. Exceeded my expectations. Fabric is nice and comfortable. Design is fun. Length is great. I am 5'7&#34;,225pounds, 36DD. I bought L and fit me well. It's little bit big on me,especially at the top ,chest area and around arms opening ,but I tried it on without a bra,so hopefully with appropriate bra this issue will be resolved.<br />It's supposed to be flowing And I afraid if I get smaller size it will be short and I hate &#34;shorter maxi&#34;.So will keep L. Great summer dress. Recommended"
5.0,This thing is sooo cute i love the color and it fite so nicely im glad i bought this i was a bit scared at first of what i was going to get but the price is worth it
5.0,"This a really nice watch! Large without being too big.  It's also got a nice &#34;heft&#34; to it.  It looks nice on the arm and has good chrono functions, including fractions of second."
5.0,My order of the men‚Äôs Cuban chain bracelet arrived plated in exquisite yellow gold with an easy to operate springy hook that closes on a small ring. I‚Äôm not muscular and so the closed bracelet slipped easily unto my wrist. Using tools from my tool box I removed five links to downsize the accessory. (DIY risks tarnishing a link so it‚Äôs best to have this done in a jewelry shop). Check it out in the photos here. Nice! (Do follow manufacturer‚Äôs instructions regarding maintenance).
5.0,I had no idea these were men's glasses when I bought them for about the same price at a warehouse store.  They are the best glasses I've ever had!!!  They are SO light weight and the arms are bendable.  I'd get them again in a heartbeat.  Came to Amazon hoping to find them in another color or something similar to change it up a bit.
5.0,"There is not much to say but how nice this jacket is.  I'm slim and 5'7"", I ordered a size small which fit me perfectly.  However, I don't recommend wearing this jacket if its very cold outside as you will need something a lot heavier."
5.0,I wasn't expecting too much buying coverups online. This was a much appreciated suprise. The dress is super cute although I did remove the removable cups and wear a swimsuit top underneath. It is perfect for on the boat to the restaurant for lunch. Super quick drying. It is very comfortable and flattering. I would purchase the same product in different patterns or colors.
5.0,"Typical excellent Lanz quality. Quality weight, good warmth, mid calf length, size true, shipped fast, true color, laundry nice w no shrink"
5.0,I love it... It's durable.. easy to attach.. Easy to take on and off...
5.0,GREAT. That is all I can say about this. My sister and I have Bought Mom several pins over the last few weeks for obvious reasons and this is her favorite.
5.0,Fits just rightI absolutely love these pants sometimes I end up working on the bottoms of them when I go upstairs if I‚Äôm not claim is there is there anything they fit perfect and I‚Äôm 5 ‚Äú4‚Äù! Had them for almost a year now and the color has stayed and they are perfectly well-made and credible love them
5.0,"I love how they perfectly match the Live version Belle dress she wore as the flower girl for a Beauty and the Beast themed wedding. However, I had the hardest time getting a size to fit.  Ordering 3 pairs and returning 2, to finally get ones to just work and still had to put cotton in the toes. She wears a 13 in several different types of shoes being dress shoes, flip flops, house slippers, moccasins and athletic shoes that fit her fine. The Belle shoes that we wound up keeping was the 13/1 and fit more like a 1/2 but the 11/12 was way too small. She is tall and slender, so they weren't too wide, just too long by a true 1 1/4&#34;. Not a problem for dress up play, allowing room to grow but I was afraid she was going to trip down the aisle at the wedding. She loved them with her dress though and the little trooper never complained once. She did wear white lace trimmed dress socks because they're made of a plastic material that I love!!  It's a sleek smooth clear plasticcoating that completely shields over the glitter and is 100% protected from any glitter shedding but it would've gave her blisters for sure without socks. Measure your little ones feet and go by their listed size chart. Follow US size to the left of chart to the inches her feet are on the left of chart, and go with size that fits the inches of her feet, no matter if this is the normal size you buy for her or not."
5.0,It‚Äôs backyard decor.
5.0,I will wear these with my navy raincoat.  The leather is soft and the detail on the gloves make them look like more expensive leather gloves.
5.0,"Well made, soft, & the cotton is great for sleeping in.  I now have 5 of their nightgowns : long sleeved, short sleeved, & sleeveless.  I do order 1 size larger to allow for the cotton to shrink in washer/dryer.  Well worth the money."
5.0,"Great shirt i love it, it fits perfectly and fells great in the warm or hot weather."
5.0,I loved the price and I came in 2 days as promised..I loved the convience if not having to go to the store. It fits really good and it's soft. I love it.

5.0,Looks amazing on my daughter
5.0,"Got as a gift for a friend, no complaints"
5.0,So many compliments. The are mix matched to perfection. Always get compliments. Great stone quality. No issues. Also they are not too heavy at all. I‚Äôm typically concerned with that area with metal earrings.
5.0,Larger than expected but cute
5.0,Absolutely perfect been looking for a water sign pendant for so long that wasnt cheap looking this ones perfect
5.0,"Love love love them. Soft, high waisted, thick enough and pockets!"
5.0,"I ordered 3 of these by accident in SILVER, but used them well for all the birthdays and holidays that came up.  I also got it in gold (just one) had my niece in mind when I purchased them, 25 years old and loves giraffes. The quality is very good, and the chain it comes on is sturdy.  The pendant is petite but won't get lost in clothing.  Nice and shiny, I am sure the recipients will get many complements on their gifts. Love the fact it came in silver and gold!!!!!"
5.0,Love this top!!  Another PB great buy. I wear small but buy medium and it‚Äôs perfect.
5.0,Great basic top. Decent quality and nice fit. I actually bought a second in another color after trying this one on üòÅ
5.0,Good looking cap. Well made.
5.0,"Ordered one and liked the smaller size so much I ordered another! If you're like me, I have these spread around the house and they're much more attractive than the plain ones. Horn was smooth in both of mine."
5.0,"Very good suspenders, I have them for a few months already, use it weekly. Never had any problem."
5.0,great little stands A+++
5.0,It's exactly what I thought it was

5.0,It‚Äôs very pretty and I had to take 2 links out but it was super easy! I will definitely be ordering more can‚Äôt complain with that price! Update loved it so much I ordered the rose gold to match my watch and will order more I‚Äôm sure
5.0,Helps keep all my cords organized.

5.0,Quality leather
5.0,Perfect size. Sparkle so nicely. Lots of colors
5.0,"These are the cutest chunky platforms! Sparkly metallic vinyl straps are eye catching, and they are really comfortable. I just wish they had a heel supporting strap on the back. I tend to be a little clumsy in slipper sandals.<br />Size 9 ordered, usually wear a women‚Äôs US 9-9.5"
5.0,I love Polarn O Pyret products. They are well designed for active kids and these are adjustable to be able to use them for a few years.
5.0,Comfortable and provided lots of air space.  I can keep the mask on so much longer.
5.0,Haven't gotten a chance to wear them but I will say they're nice and was well packaged.
5.0,My husband loves these! Great product.
5.0,"With watches going out of fashion, I was glad to find someone still making watch bands. This one seems well made and fits much better than the tiny one the watch came with."
5.0,It fits just like a regular size medium. I like it a lot.
5.0,"Oh my goodness, this is the most comfortable sports bra I have ever worn.  The fabric is soft and stretchy.  The pads hold the girls where they're supposed to be, however, they are a rad smaller than I need and will likely shift with fast arm exercises.  I'll probably swap them out for larger inserts.  But the bra itself is wonderful.  I'm going to order more colors to layer under tank tops."
5.0,This company has very well made items. They are all waterproof and wind proof. I have bought numerous items at their Chicago Premium Outlet Mall in Aurora. Excellent!
5.0,I love these pants. Perfect fit. Quick shipping!!
5.0,My grandkids love them
5.0,Good quality and warm
5.0,"I had to go down a size from a 38 M to a 37 M. The company is the best in quality and service. Plus, the shoes are so comfortable and pleasant to the eye!<br />I love the shoes."
5.0,Bought for my daughter and she loves it.
5.0,"These are great socks.  They fit nice, are comfortable work well with rain or snow boots, high top tennis shoes, or dress boots in either ankle height or tall. The are truly knee sock.  They come up to the knee as expected.  Bought these in two size and they fit right on both girls and left me not needing to buy any other knee highs for the rest of the winter.  The pricing was very good and the quality is excellent."
5.0,"I finally picked up my package at the post office today! I was so excited for this watch, but keep missing the mailman when he'd come to drop it off. The watch is really sleek and sporty. So far, I prefer to wear it with my fitness apparel. It's a little on the bulkier side, so it's perfect for a sporty look, but I probably wouldn't wear this watch every day since my everyday attire is much more girly. I bought this watch to wear at work though since my work uniform is black. As a server, this watch would be great to wear for shifts. It's waterproof! I love the silicone feel. It's so smooth and isn't rough against my wrist. There's enough holes in the wristband to make the watch easily adjustable as well, so that's convenient. Overall, this watch is a solid purchase."
5.0,Just buy them!! So perfect after wearing a hoop for 5 years now this is definitely the best!
5.0,Great color and style.  Can be worn for work or a night out.
5.0,Love the feel and fit
5.0,"Loved, but REMEMBER THAT FIT AS EXPECTED ONLY APPLIES IF YOU READ THEIR CHART!! I did and it fits great!"
5.0,"My daughter loves her new purse. Very pretty, good construction, nice and roomy but not bulky."
5.0,I was amazed by this dress! Classy and flattering.
5.0,I am really happy with this dress. It is super flattering. I ordered a medium and could have ordered a small for a tighter fit but the medium fits comfortable and the straps adjust.
5.0,My daughter and wife loved them and she (my daughter) wears them every day!
5.0,These are really comfy and super cute. I have no complaints.
5.0,"Bought these for my teen; he loves them and they look great on him. Reasonably priced, arrived quickly with a nice storage sack. Would buy again."
5.0,I've gotten many compliments when I wear this dress. I like to wear it with a long necklace for a casual date or shopping or I still pair it with a cardigan and wedges for work. Fits great.
5.0,perfect fit and style
5.0,Love this band its super comfortable the first few times I wore it it was just a little too tight but the band stretched out to the perfect fit after a few wears
5.0,I love the flare look. It really looks good.
5.0,"looks exactly like the picture, and it‚Äôs literally perfect lol. i think it‚Äôs shorter than most phone charms from the other ones i‚Äôve seen, but it looks great on my phone."
5.0,"It runs a little big my 8 yr girl that wears 14 size, i bougth sz 10. And fitted perfectly even really big, like a whole size bigger but like its a pjs, its great that its Big, also will last more ok her. Ah! Its really warm, super warm for cold cold weather."
5.0,Very cute  Wears well
5.0,Adorable and well made. Bought as a gift for a photographer friend and I just know she will love it.
5.0,"As other reviewers have stated the material is thickish, but  not too thick. It is well made. In short: it does not look cheap."
5.0,Nice quality and Great Price
5.0,Perfect! My third purchase from Back From Bali and won‚Äôt be my last!
5.0,Lovely and easy to use. I looks better in person than the pictures
5.0,"At first I thought I wasn‚Äôt going to like it. I was ready to return. But after getting the time set up and spending a day with it, it‚Äôs not a bad buy. It‚Äôs not expensive and looks and feel really nice.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the right middle button, is a little big for my taste but you get use to it.<br /><br />Seems durable and after a few wears the ‚Äúnew watch stiffness‚Äù starts to wear off.<br /><br />I would buy again."
5.0,"I am a medium (38R) in almost everything and the XL fit me quite well. The cotton is nice and soft, not mesh. I got the navy/orange. It looks super cool. The giraffe is noticeable but not huge."
5.0,You can wear it off the shoulder or on. It looks adorable!
5.0,"Great Watch, great price. ty"
5.0,Good length and fits on sunglasses with wide ends on temples
5.0,They say this is a nightgown but really perfect for all occasions. Love the pockets very flowy and fabric is super soft
5.0,Works as described
5.0,Very nice dress. Needs hammed because it is on the long side. Otherwise it fits very nicely.
5.0,"yes, perfectly"
5.0,"This is my favorite sweater. I wear a size 8 and purchased a medium. I wore this sweater with a vneck cotton top, dressy work pants, and dressy chunky heel oxfords You can also wear this with jeans and boots. Very versatile and classy. I ordered the ivory with red and black trim"
5.0,"There must be some magic in the Eye of Horus, because people seem to react differently around me when wearing this.  Most 'normal' people don't really comment on it, but look at it funny sometimes, some people have even seemed intimidated by it.  Curious types will ask what it is, but really deep people think it's real cool."
5.0,"Sellers are extremely responsive with any issues, which is a major plus when buying anything! The band is a very, very good quality, not plastic feeling at all like some of those other brands. I would buy again, in multiple colors, for sure! I am one happy customer!"
5.0,Great fit and easy to put on. My child loves it.
5.0,Looks like it won‚Äôt break like all other cheap cases.  Get one with a strap for the lid or make one.
5.0,It is my most worn coat.  Light weight and warm.
5.0,"Cool jacket! Money worthy! I bought a Median size ( 40) waist size 32 and fitted just like a Glove, so many compliments !"
5.0,"Cute, soft leotard. Fits as expected."
5.0,"This is the perfect size hoop. Not overly big, but you can still see them. I wear them a lot and they don't unhook. They are real sterling silver.<br /><br />UPDATE: The clasp can loosen up sometimes....silver is SOFT. When they do become loose, I just squeeze the clasp together a bit more. Easily done with a tiny pliers or your teeth. After 2 years, these are STILL my go to hoops. I wear them 5 or 6 days out of every week...that's how good they are. I still think 2 inch hoops are the perfect size."
5.0,"I'm not sure why this jacket is listed as ""running large"" and advising buyers to ""order up."" My son is 6' tall and weighs 200 lbs. He's got broad shoulders and a thick chest. Usually he needs an XL to accommodate his shoulders. I ordered this jacket for him in a Large and it fits great (see pic)! I would actually say that this jacket runs big, not small at all. He really likes the jacket - loves the color, the style and the quality of the fabric. He's excited to have this as the weather cools this fall. We recommend!"
5.0,Perfect fit and really improved my driving on rainy days!
5.0,Very pretty hat.  I added flowers and details to the top for my Taako cosplay.  I love that you can bend the wire and change the look of the hat.
5.0,Great fit......even on me!  Good material. Great quality.
5.0,Gave to my mom who lives in nursing home and she had lots of fun cheering up other residents turning on and off.
5.0,This Handy chart is everything! Perfect addition for you kit when traveling. It‚Äôs compact; but fans open and have more than enough swatch nail tips.
5.0,I like that the delivery service was fast and the cookies are great. Will be ordering more soon.<br /><br />Thanks
5.0,This is a good purchase. Pants are soft and nice. They fit very nice and super comfortable
5.0,"Oh how I love these glasses! I got this as a graduation gift for my young family friend, and I know he'll love these, he's a big Minecraft fan. The right size, not HUGE but not SMALL. I would buy these again."
5.0,"I can‚Äôt believe these are my first pair of blue blocking glasses. I take online and remote classes now and these save my eyes during the hours of staring and reading from my laptop screen. I even like to wear them using my phone and watching TV but I got the darkest lenses they have so I might see if the 40 or 60 level is more appropriate for zoom (the darkest ones have a blue glare from the front and tints white color to a pale, light amber but it‚Äôs not bad if you don‚Äôt need to be on camera.) the frames and lenses don‚Äôt feel too cheap or plasticy. They have a nice weight to them but not heavy at all. I love the zip up protective case they come with and the cleaning cloth! My red frames are quite fun, but I‚Äôm eyeing the tortoise and peach or tortoise and green ones next, and I might add some strength (0.5) to the next ones and see if that relieves more eye strain!"
5.0,I love these earrings- the blue is absolutely gorgeous. I received them several days ago and I am still wearing them! They are the perfect size for me.  I highly recommend these earrings!
5.0,"These are freakin‚Äô incredible.  I‚Äôm a small person with a larger booty.  Most underwear fall victim to my butt, and I end up with Bunchy boy brief thong wedgies!  I have never had a pair of underwear that makes me so happy!!"
5.0,And just to my waist at any size. Excellent piece of equipment.
5.0,I'm 140 I got a large. I'm a C cup and it was perfect. If your hips and but are big though get a xl I'm a size 7 and not any hips so it was a great fit.
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress!  It fit me perfect, I received so many compliments!  It is comfortable and very stylish, I wish I had about 10 of these dresses in different colors!!"
5.0,My wife enjoys these. Very nice costume jewelry.
5.0,Works just right
5.0,I just loved the dress! I received several compliments on it. I will definitely get another one.
5.0,Love this bra! Super comfortable! It fits just right and the back does not pinch. The clasp in the front is easy to open and close but wont come undone. It's a metal clasp so I think it will last a long time as appose to the plastic kind. I love the color of this bra! I received this product at a discount for my review.
5.0,Really happy with this set for my 4 year olds. Perfect fit all around without any sagging or stretching in the back.
5.0,Nice fit and feel.  The sleeves are on the shorter side.  Overall good quality.
5.0,"my new favorite  legging, fit great and get constant compliments on the look."
5.0,"These socks are great quality and fit well! Bright, bold colors look as pictured."
5.0,Love it! Fits perfectly and the color is great!
5.0,Love this bag.  Had a weird smell at first but it faded away quickly.
5.0,"This is a beautiful band. It is heavy duty and goes with the watch housing very well it really classes up the appearance of this watch. Not bad for the  Price paid. It was very easy to install, a little trickery to removing links. You just have to be careful and take your time . I was able to remove two lanes without destroying the link removal tool but I can see where you can easily break the tool. it is kind of flimsy. All in all a good Watch band and I highly recommend it."
5.0,"We have a preemie with mild hypotonia and our PT recommended this shirt to help our little dude develop proprioception.  He‚Äôs starting to walk and his confidence level went up very quickly once he started wearing this shirt.<br />It‚Äôs not made of the greatest quality but I‚Äôm hoping it will last. I will purchase a second one to alternate for sure.<br />Size chart is a little off. I first purchased the XS based on chest measurements but it was SO snug our skinny toddler complained and immediately wanted it off (he‚Äôs 16mo). I exchanged it for the size S, tried it on, he didn‚Äôt complain so I washed it (accidentally put it in the dryer (but at very low heat, luckily!) and it shrank a tiny bit but stretched back out  - my bad - but it survived so yay!!) and he‚Äôs been wearing it since with no issues!!<br />Our OT told us to start with 30min, 2X day.<br />He‚Äôs a pretty calm dude overall but as with lots of toddlers, has his tantrum moments when he‚Äôs getting tired or hungry.  We noticed that, as a bonus, he seemed calmer in high stress situations (bed time approaching/overtired, trip to the pediatrician) so it actually made me think of my dogs‚Äô thundershirts!  I wish I knew about this sooner, because it‚Äôs just a nice thing to have for inevitable stressful moments one will encounter at some point during toddlerhood."
5.0,"Just got this backpack and it's great so far. I wanted to stop lugging around heavy tote bags to maybe save my shoulders and back from some pain. Success!<br /><br />The main compartment is large enough for legal file folders I have to schlep around, and the top opening allows easy access without risking major file folder paper cuts (that's a thing!) I wish there was a key holder/clip but will make due with the pockets. The material feels sturdy and maybe water resistant - haven't had the chance to test it in the rain just yet. My coworkers are jealous of the cute design. Def a good, economical purchase!"
5.0,Best awsome
5.0,"I was looking for a piece of jewelery that contained hematite when I came across this wrap bracelet.  I have only had it for 2 days but am finding it to be durable, comfortable and stylish.  Having a smaller wrist, this bracelet wraps around 5 times.  It is also long enough to be worn doubled around the neck as a choker."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d2988928d234f06a0c891dc9df76e75]] I am usually very hesitant to buy clothes for my wife because I will either get the size wrong, the color wrong, the style wrong or some combination of those three. A scarf is a safe bet, though, so I selected this scarf with the intention of giving it to her as a surprise. It is a nicer scarf than I expected.<br /><br />This is a cashmere-blend scarf that is made of some of the softest material I have ever felt in an article of clothing, even softer than a fleece blanket which should say a lot. It has a texture similar to wool but without the scratchiness and without the distinct smell that comes with wool (I like that smell but it's very unique). The tassels are all about 3‚Äù long and are all along the short edge.<br /><br />Unfolded and stretched out this scarf is a little over 2' wide and is about 7' long.<br /><br />In addition to being so soft, it's well made too. I have found no blemishes in the material and no nits, pills or cuts. The stitching is tight and straight.<br /><br />This is not an expensive scarf but is far and away better than I hoped. It is exceptionally soft and very nicely made. For once I just might make some points with my wife for picking out clothing for her.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no/minimal cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it."
5.0,"I got this raincoat for my 8 year old who wears a 7/8 and got this in an 8. This raincoat is definitely a quality coat! I love the navy with polka dot design, just enough fun for my daughter without being too little girl.<br /><br /> It is a little long, which I love since that means she has room to grow into. The sleeves have thumb holes in it, which I was a little surprised and thought was strange but my daughter is all about it. It is lined in a great material so it stays warm for the cool rainy days. The zipper goes all the way up, which is so nice and something none of our other rain coats do.<br /><br />She LOVES this rain coat so much! And I love that she can grow into it."
5.0,"I love the fit of this! Based on the reviews I ordered a large (5'2, 118 lbs, 35&#34; hip) and it fit perfectly. If you are not sure about wearing a thong swimsuit this is a nice way to ease you into it. It provides good coverage along the hip and lower back/upper butt. I was so pleased that I just ordered two more colors! You can't beat the price either!"
5.0,Loved the way it fitted on my grandson
5.0,Gorgeous slippers but I ordered them a bit too big but overall great quality and my daughter was super excited to receive them.<br />Delivery was faster than mentioned
5.0,"I bought these for my cruise and I love, love, love them.  They are so comfortable and fit perfectly,  So comfortable and so attractive.  I am going to purchase more colors if I can find them."
5.0,"I was not expecting the level of quality that came with this dress. I figured it would look good enough in pictures, but would possibly look shoddy up close. Not the case. Ordered two of them, same size, for my daughters to wear to my son's adoption day. Not only do they fit exceptionally perfect on both of them, the detail is exquisite.<br /><br />The only downside is that they are a little short, which I hadn't anticipated. So, if you're getting this for your little one, you might want to get some bloomers to match. I'm getting some ivory ones to match the ivory headband the girls will be wearing with the burgundy dresses."
5.0,"I love the way these fit and feel. They help hold everything in and smooth it out. The pockets are extremely helpful too! I always come back and buy more of them. I have like five pairs, love the color options too."
5.0,I really like these glasses especially the gold. They were a great price at about $7 but the list price says $35 they are definitely not $35 quality though
5.0,Loved the dress
5.0,Very impressed with the quality of this shirt!  It‚Äôs a present for my nephew and I can‚Äôt wait for him to see it.
5.0,I love wearing this
5.0,These are so cute! They came in way earlier then expected and they fit on any hand and finger! Bought them for my mom and she definitely wants more!!
5.0,My dermatologist recommended wearing compression socks because I am on my feet a lot and have gotten a few spider veins.  I have ordered other Copper Fit products and have been pleased with the quality of their products so I ordered with them.  I have never worn compression socks before and am pleased with how comfortable they are even with the tight fit and my legs and feet feel so much better on the days I am on my feet a lot.
5.0,"I am 5'9&#34; and most pants are way too short. These are an awesome fit.<br />Love, love, love them.  They are sooo comfortable!  I will be ordering more. Thank you. Great product."
5.0,Much smaller than I expected. I teacher kids 5-10 and these will only be good for the 5-7 year old kids. Still good quality and great price.
5.0,This shirt was for my son and the shirt is a nice thick sturdy cotton! Love it and the image looks as depicted.
5.0,I love this necklace! I just wish it was a little shorter so that the inside necklace was more of a choker. But regardless its really pretty.
5.0,"I am crazy about this sweater.  It's my absolute favorite and I wear it constantly. However, there are some important differences between it and the others sold on this listing (of which I own a few), and a few things that are incorrectly listed about this particular sweater.<br /><br />1) The material for this style (color: Taupe, Style: COLPK009) is completely different from the thin, silky-feeling cardigans (listed as &#34;95% RAYON 5% SPANDEX'&#34; and &#34;[COLPR009] 95% POLYESTER 5% SPANDEX&#34;).  This listing does not accurately include the actual material for this magnificent taupe cardigan. However, I can confirm that the label on my taupe sweater says, &#34;65% Rayon,30% Polyester, 7% spandex; Style: COLPK009; RN#148199.&#34; It feels very soft, more like cotton/t-shirt material.  Before you wash it the first time, it's very *slightly* fuzzy, like the thinnest hint of cashmere.<br /><br />2) The product # is wrong.  This listing claims the taupe cardigan is CoFpk009. In reality, the tag says &#34;CoLpk009.&#34;  (Capitalization altered for emphasis.) I don't know if that will matter much, but be aware of the difference.  I suspect there are several minor mistakes in this listing.<br /><br />3) I believe there are at least 5 different style #s and materials here. I own a few of categories A & D listed below. Since I suspect the material composition & product numbers are wrong on some of those here, I suggest you zoom in on the pictures and read the reviews to distinguish between the different types of material on this listing:<br />A) Style COFPK009: My favorite! Listed as &#34;With front pockets&#34; (This includes the COFPK009_hacci Taupe, which I bought, and apparently include Cofpk009_hacci Grey & Cofpk009_hacci Pink). The label on my Taupe cardigan says, &#34;65% Rayon,30% Polyester, 7% spandex. Excellent quality.<br />B) Style COLPR009: Listed as &#34;95% POLYESTER 5% SPANDEX&#34; and &#34;Floral Print&#34;<br />C) Style COLTD009: No description, but appears to be the tie-dyed looking prints.<br />D) Style COLMF009: Listed as &#34;Soft jersey material long length hi-lo style.&#34; I bought this style in black. The material is thin, summer-weight and feels like cotton.<br />E) Style: CSFPK009: Listed as &#34;Sweater cardigan with front pockets&#34;<br /><br />4)  Too small. I wear a size 1X or sometimes 2X (for a larger bosom).  However, I noticed that this listing's high-rayon, silky sweaters all fit VERY tight on my arms, accenting every bit of fat.  (If you don't have pudgy arms, don't worry about this, because the fit is otherwise fine) So I ordered the taupe sweater larger than I had the silky ones.  Success! Not only does the material itself prevent that skin-tight fit, but going up a size just clearly fits better.  So I suggest you order at least one size up, unless you want that tight fit on your arms. If you are ordering the silky-looking, higher-rayon sweaters, you might want to order 2 sizes bigger than your normal fit.<br /><br />Judging from the pictures, it looks to me that there are 3 sweaters on this listing (COFPK, or category A above) which probably have the looser, cotton-feeling, higher-quality material: Cofpk009_hacci Taupe (this one, which looks like sandstone), Cofpk009_hacci Pink, Cofpk009_hacci Grey.  If you look closely at the pictures, I think several others have that jersey-style material, too, but can't be positive.<br /><br />I also own the Colmf009_black. It's not bad, but I like the material and quality stitching on COFPK taupe better.<br /><br />Finally, if you do order any of these, make sure you try them on immediately to be sure you are happy with the size, the material, and the fit.  Since this is distributed domestically by Amazon, buyers in the US shouldn't have any problems with a refund or exchange."
5.0,I really like the quality of this underwear and my son does as well. We used these for the nitty-gritty stages of potty training and they held up well to multiple washes.  They are easy for him to pull up and down.
5.0,"Super comfy to wear! I absolutely love this, I get all sorts of compliments on it :)"
5.0,I love the jewelry
5.0,These shoes were purchased for a 1 year old - just starting to walk. Fit is excellent and ease of putting them on a moving child is great!
5.0,A very fine piece. My wife loved it. Now she's shopping for the perfect chain to go with it.
5.0,"These are great for getting the last bit of whatever out of that jar.  The price was good, the shipping very fast and the item was exactly as described.  I like that these are a little shorter than the last ones I had because I can leave one in the jar and not have to worry about it getting mixed in with another product."
5.0,"My daughter loves these. Wears them all the time around the house, and they look super cute."
5.0,It's Perfect<br />Best Bang for the Buck
5.0,Husband loves this! He uses it at every card night he hosts.
5.0,"I was skeptical cause I kind of have big thighs, and the sock looked like there was NO WAY, but actually quite stretchy and wasn't pinching."
5.0,"I'm very satisfied that this sunglasses are more stylish than I thought. Shades are dark enough to block excessive sunlights from eyes. Looks awesome to put on with my regular t-shirt and jeans, when either driving or traveling."
5.0,I love this purse  it is a little smaller than I expected  but very nice
5.0,"I am very happy with the look and feel of the dress. It fits beautifully, and is so comfortable! I can't wait to wear it to my Christmas party with some silver shoes and jewelry!"
5.0,Perfect replacement for band that broke that our regular jeweler didn't have in stock.
5.0,"Got a lot of compliments with this suit, very pretty, love the way it fits and flatters without showing too much."
5.0,Love it!! Other than it being way long on my short legs lol
5.0,Comfy and cozy big sweater. Great with leggings
5.0,"My dad makes fun of me and says I look like a traffic cop, but cars can see me when I go to walk the dog in the evening, and that's what matters! Very lightweight; took me a minute to figure which way was up on it."
5.0,Great quality and fit! Beautiful piece you can dress up or down! Love it!
5.0,"The only thing is that it has no tag in it, so I can never figure out which side is the front or back."
5.0,Love it. Good quality and quick shipping!
5.0,my Duck son is ging to love. very nice quality
5.0,"Fit perfect, looks beautiful"
5.0,"Love this top, fit me perfectly.  5 ft 7, 145lbs."
5.0,"Love the shoe. Almost perfect fit, a little on the small side. Maybe the fur. I'll wear with then socks. I'll use them for everyday wear and light yard work."
5.0,This was even cuter in person. And very nicely made. Comfortable for a baby even an active one.
5.0,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it.  You are able to make many different Light Saber.  It's easy to take apart and put back together again.  My husband loves its too.
5.0,"I went ahead and orderd these in the 18-24  month size, despite some negative comments.  We wore the 12-18 month size in this style a ton and we wanted the next size larger, since they were outgrown.  These shoes arrived cute as ever and maybe a bit wide or large if you have a child with tiny narrow feet.  My son has a wider foot and instep, so these were perfect, no squished feet or ankles and room to grow, but not so large that we couldn't wear them.  So, I am very happy with these shoes and glad I took a chance and ordered them!"
5.0,These shorts are so very soft!! So very comfortable! I am shocked! They breathe very well during work outs which is very important. I very highly recommend!!
5.0,So soft and really good quality
5.0,Very nice for a reasonable price. Great gift
5.0,"Very soft and fits well. No pinching, very comfortable."
5.0,"Ordered the green deer dress.  2-3 years fits perfectly on a toddler that is currently wearing 2T.  The dress looked big out of the bag, but once I tried it on toddler, I realized it was perfect.  Beautiful!  Comfy!  Tulle is soft and has a softer fabric layer underneath for even more comfort.  Washed it on delicate cycle and hung to dry.  No ironing needed.  Wore it for Santa pictures with glittery gold ballerina type shoes, also from Amazon, and two little glittery gold bows from Claire‚Äôs.  She will wear it again for Christmas."
5.0,Love these! I was nervous ordering these online but I have been wearing them for a while and have no irritation at all. I love how they screw shut. Very reliable vs others I‚Äôve tried in the past. I am very pleased.
5.0,"well made. very soft. the organic leveret pjs are a bit softer than the non-organic. holds up to washing and drying. i wash cold, delicate with shirt turned inside out and dry on low."
5.0,This slippers are very warm and comfortable.  They have durable bottoms and can be worn outside if needed. I love the deep plum color I ordered.
5.0,"My husband first found these at Costco and has bought several pair. Great quality, nice fit."
5.0,Highly recommend!  Love this band so stylish
5.0,A1
5.0,"excellent, great color and fit, very comfortable"
5.0,Can find my bags now
5.0,I bought this skirt for my beach vacation and it is absolutely perfect. I am a size small and this skirt looks perfect with any bikini I had on. I got a lot of compliments! One of the best buys I did on amazon!
5.0,Glasses are light-weight and fit well.  The case is sturdy and the clip is handy to keep the glasses with me wherever I go.
5.0,Good quality cotton and fit very well. Will purchase again.
5.0,"These sunglasses were ordered for the kids who will be in our up coming wedding.  The product was very well made a very well, the quality exceeded our expectations. If we would have known they we going to be that good, we would have ordered them for all our guests.  But it‚Äôs too late for that, we already ordered and will be receiving glasses with our names and the wedding date. Our mistake."
5.0,My son really liked this ring. Right fit.
5.0,"Very good fabric, well done.<br />Medium long size a little tight on me ordering large next time"
5.0,Quick delivery and best price online. I bought this for my dad and he seemed very excited about the quality of the shirt.
5.0,This is a beautiful bag! I love it! It is the perfect size!
5.0,"I absolutely love these! Not only does the design match perfectly as the image, but they are so warm and soft on your feet! They have a nice sole on the bottom so they aren't flimsy and very durable!"
5.0,Nice and comfy.
5.0,Nice top just order size up
5.0,I have many feet problems and I need to have custom orthotics worn all the time. These house sandals allowed me to remove the original soles and put in my custom orthotics for great comfort!
5.0,"Had a little shipping issue initially but the seller was great to work with and I got another pair sent right away! Very very pleased , they are beautiful and look expensive. Great quality, comes with an actual case not just a little pouch and a cleaning towelette , I‚Äôm buying another pair for a gift ."
5.0,This is very sexy the neck back sets the outfit off to 1000%. Awesome buy
5.0,Size up 2 sizes! My daughter is in 7s and I got her an 8. Fits perfect! BUT.. Not really growing room or room for thick warm socks..<br />Keeping since I no longer see these ones available. But I would re-order if they had them in 9s!
5.0,"We bought this to help protect our 14 month old (at the time) daughter on a two week trip to Jamaica and it did an amazing job. First it shipped to us quickly and arrived in perfect new condition as expected. It is adjustable and fit her little head quite well, the adjustable chin strap kept it in place. We were worried she would yank it off but it was never a problem as she like the shade to her eyes and was always to busy play or hanging onto something. It was definitely cute as well and we received many compliments on her in it. We also purchased an excellent long sleeve Tuga swim top and diaper combo on here that was UV rated as well and she never burned her porcelain skin once during long days at the beach and in the ocean playing:) the hat not only covered her face and head but her body enough to wear regular suits also (with sun block of course). It did get kinda dingy from the ocean and sunblock etc after 2 weeks in Jamaica and didn't come clean rinsing it in the shower there but laundered clean once home. It is definitely a must have beach item for a toddler can't recommend it enough. Thank you for reading my review, hope it helps you protect you little lived one as well"
5.0,Love it. So many ways to use it and very practical
5.0,"I just love the retro style from Casio, very durable"
5.0,"The shirt is really comfortable and lightweight.  I don't feel encumbered at all.  The hood is great, especially if it is rainy or you just feel agoraphobic but want to get outside.  I ordered 3 and love them all."
5.0,Not too big for my wrist. Fits good
5.0,This dress fit perfectly and is gorgeous. The pockets are amazing. Already ordered another dress in another color
5.0,Ordering more
5.0,These are so cute and made well. My 8 year old loves it and put it on right away on herself and her doll.
5.0,Perfect for walking the dog on cold days.  Also good as  face shielding for public outings.
5.0,"My favorite pajamas! Wish had more colors would by more. These are soft, silky and light weight."
5.0,It's. A gift for my son. I travel in December. But he chose them through. Amazon. Thanks
5.0,"I have had a pair for about 5 years and I am a hard core walker. These are top notch because:<br />-The sole will outlive any other<br />-Nice bounce<br />-and there are actually Two REAL belt buckles one for the back of the heel, one for the top of the foot. This shoe really hugs your foot and you are ready to walk and even hike. And as you stretch the real leather over time, you can retighten them. How about that? I am sad to say that the trend today is to do away with the real buckles and to give you that lame, short inch of Velcro that needs constant tightening if you are a serious walker. Also the back strap buckle seem to be gone altogether so after stretching, you are doomed with a loose flip flop.<br /> My beloved ""dr martens closed toe sandals 11687"" are getting in need of stitching a bit but its been 5 years. I'll have my old pair fixed until they reissue this marvel.<br />BTW, Dr., if you're listening, your new ugly line has NO closed toe. Please reissue this.I'd love to have it in Navy and another pair in white. Thank you, BL"
5.0,I love the blouse however I was disappointed in the color. It is an ugly green. I wear it with jeans or white pants. Blacks and brown  blouses are better colors.
5.0,"This is one of the prettiest beads ever. It's nice and clear with bold colors. One of my favorites, it goes with everything."
5.0,"This is by far the softest and warmest neck gaiters I own! Got them at Costco for $7.99 (regular price there is $9.99) so it's a rip-off here selling at almost $20. If you don't have Costco though, this is worth the investment!"
5.0,Excellent I love it
5.0,Received the item on time and as described. The sizing chart is very accurate. I loved the fit on the swimsuit !
5.0,Great product! Runs a little small so order 1 size bigger than normal. Very light and comfy. Perfect for doing Blacktop/Sealcoating!
5.0,"This is such a nice toiletry bag for men or women.It has tons of pockets and they have zippers to keep stuff safe and sound and not falling out all over the place. very useful for the go or a bag for the gym. The quality of the materials are fantastic and the workmanship is excellent.The fabric is nylon which is super easy to keep clean. This toiletry bag holds quite a lot of different items,make up,toothpaste,shampoo etc..I love that it matches all of my luggage.This toiletry bag I would recommend to anyone,especially the business traveler"
5.0,"This is way prettier in person. I got a bunch of compliments the day I wore it. If you are questioning, go ahead and buy this because you won't regret it. It matches lots of outfits because of all of the colors."
5.0,Just received the bracelet so nice I love the stones I will buy from seller again and received it faster than estimated great thank you
5.0,These are beautiful!  They were worth the $9.99 I paid for and more.  I bought two to give away as gifts.  Great for a teenage girl!
5.0,Absolutely love these! They stay in place and are so comfortable
5.0,"ok quality, warmer than they look in the fingers, handle 40¬∞ weather admirably."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ac8a19e00e3ab8467f905e6a2118c844]] Really, this thing sounds good. Compared to a variety of open ear solutions -- bone conduction, neck speakers, glasses, this has the best sound. Because you can manipulate the tiny speakers in the cloth you can get it to really nail the placement. In audio, placement is huge.<br /><br />Basically two drivers the size of silver dollars and some kind of control panel.  After a coupon I paid $8, and got a armband for phones as a add-on.<br /><br />Keep expectations in check, but allow yourself to actually enjoy the music. It's a barebones product with cheap plastics basically then in a hole in the hat. But just move the speakers against your ear until the sound gets full. I heard ""young and beautiful"" from Gatsby soundtrack. You could really hear the deep, warm vocals"
5.0,You can't beat this suit for the price. It is really nice quality and looks just as pictured. I am really happy with this purchase. I ordered a 3xl and I wear a 16.
5.0,"These gloves are awesome. I've used them white grating, zesting, using a mandoline slicer, using a microplane... Really they're great for any time you might accidentally get cut in the kitchen. I have also machine washed and dried them, not had any problems there. They seem durable and are a great price. The only downside is that they run small. I have pretty tiny hands and got a medium based on other reviews. They fit great."
5.0,It's a beautiful watch for the price.
5.0,Like this so much I ordered more.
5.0,The product quality was as expected and the comfort and fit was perfect as well.  I only wished the large size matching pajama pants didn't fit so tight as a large.
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter‚Äôs 15th birthday party that was 80s themed. The teenagers loved them and the adults did too! They fit everyone perfectly, and even the little kids could wear them for a little while. I highly recommend these!"
5.0,"We bought this to match Dad's jersey.  The fabric is light enough to breathe but quality enough to take a football game or ten outside.  It is longer/wider in the body, so in the fall, we plan on being able to wear a hoodie under it.  The numbers are not stitched like Dad's, but seem high quality (not the cheap plastic-y vinyl letters)."
5.0,This is my second wallet from Recycled Firefighter and it is fantastic. This is the best quality anyone can find anywhere; second to none! And it looks great too.
5.0,was a gift for my daughter but she loves it fits her perfectly wears it almost everyday could have used some care instructions
5.0,"This necklace is absolutely beautiful. It's very delicate, and feminine. Very nice set for girls of any age."
5.0,Great hat. Work outside 12 hours a day so I need sun protection. This works better than my best hat. Side note...shipping requires hat to be folded several times to fit in bag. I put mine on a table overnight with some heavy items to get the hat flat again.
5.0,"You need a hammer, plyers and thumbnail to make it smaller, it's not very easy, but definitely quality stuff. I thought it would be too bulky, but not at all. It didn't help that it didnt come with instructions on how to make the wrist band smaller.<br />If you're looking on how to make it smaller yourself without having to go someplace, go to YouTube and look at ""how to resize stainless steel watches"""
5.0,Love these..very cute
5.0,This bag is awesome so much space to put all your ammo cleaning stuff fits
5.0,Love the way this looks !!
5.0,I love all the Patty boutik sweaters they're made so that they fit little bit larger women like me but they're stylish and cute so I don't feel frumpy.

5.0,Beautiful .true to size .even u get up one size up look better
5.0,"This is about the 5th time I've tried to buy shirt that delivered on both. On me, it actually goes to within an inch of the knee, and that's sufficient that I can also use it for a nightshirt... and I do. I just wish it was microfiber."
5.0,I have been using them for several months and they work perfectly.
5.0,I purchased these for my 13 almost 14 year old Disney loving niece and she Loves them. I especially love the cute eye mask.
5.0,"I've been eyeing these pants for a few weeks and decided to just go ahead and order them. I'm 5'2 and currently 160lbs. Usually wear a sz 12 in jeans. I bought these in a medium. When I first opened them I thought no way would these fit, but they stretch and fot great! Very flattering. Only complaint is the waist kinda rolls down on the waist a bit when exercising. I'm about to go buy the cheetah print"
5.0,Adorable! Perfect for Christmas pictures.

5.0,My 25 year old LOVES her new keychain! Never too old for HP!
5.0,"Like this belt but thought it would be a bit longer so it was easier to pull through. I am a 46 waist thought my size would be considered, however, once I used it the leather stretched and is just right.  I‚Äôve found this belt to be one of my favorites ever owned bc of the ease in using it. Very good product and I would definitely get another color in the future."

5.0,"I bought 8 of these in different colors, for my wife. She liked the platinum and gunmetal faces the best. She likes novelty watches. She likes novelty watches. She says that the safety pin watches are comfortable and likes their looks. She has been wearing them for two and a half years and not one of them has stopped, or broken apart. She's still very happy."
5.0,This is simple but classy. The quality is superior to other dresses I have purchased. This is the dress to wear for moves on the field.

5.0,One of the most common contributers to &#34;tennis elbow&#34; is improper cool - down and these fill the bill.
5.0,I really like this. It is not see through. Feels a little stiff but I‚Äôll wash it. It doesn‚Äôt really fit my chest area 38D but it stays open anyway and it looks good eveywhere else.
5.0,"Very nice ring for the money. Had it over a month and no stones have fallen out. A little bit thin, but I like the fact that it's light, which is good for a big ring. I especially like the cut out pattern. Extremely reflective stones. Very pleased. I would highly recommend it!"
5.0,"I clean houses and it gets super hot sometimes and these are perfect because of the breathable fabric. Also, sometimes I get wet from washing dishes or scrubbing the bathrooms and this fabric drys fast so no more walking around after with a wet shirt."
5.0,Super soft and comfortable
5.0,I ordered these for my husband. He wanted the yellow frames ( easy to find) and loves the interchangeable lens. Came with a nice case as well. Would order agin if needed.

5.0,Great quality also.
5.0,Second time I ordred this watch.  First one still working after 5 years.  The band tore but replacing the band was a few dollars less than the new watch.
5.0,"They ride up your crack a bit, but they are comfy and what I was looking for!!"
5.0,These are cute and seem sturdy. I got the 10mm which are slightly too big for my tragus (just a little bit obtrusive) and too small to fit my nose (that was an experiment anyway).
5.0,99% of the time Grace karin clothes are perfect. I loved it and wore in Valentines day. I will buy couple more in different color if it comes

5.0,very large size will get 2x instead of 3x next time ...
5.0,"This is a good heavy, strong, durable and beautiful set of Rosary beads. I wanted a masculine look, heavy in weight and durable strong links. That's exactly what I got with these Rosary beads. They come in a small plastic case/box. It's easy to see that these will last many years of praying the Rosary even by someone like me with large strong heavy hands. I would recommend to anyone seeking a good looking heavy duty set of Rosary beads. NOTE: I was not given a discount or free product for this review, I am simply a consumer posting my honest experience and opinion to help other consumers."
5.0,Love these harem pants I really wish they came in more colors than they have. Please look into providing more colors.
5.0,"The bracelet looks exactly has pictured. I've been wearing for over 2 weeks and string is still perfect, no pulls or loose threads.  However, it is very small.  I have a really small wrist so it's perfect of me.  But, it might be too small for an average or larger wrist."
5.0,These are nice. I got exactly what I saw in the photo and read in the description.
5.0,Most comfortable hat I've ever owned!! Not to mention super cool!
5.0,"I bought this hat in beige and blue. The beige one (the one featured here) has a soft, warm lining. The blue one doesn‚Äôt. I like them both and enjoy having different options depending on how cold it is."
5.0,wonderful rings. looks just like the picture
5.0,Great fit and cute and soft!!
5.0,"They are very roomy and have a tie waist so you can customize the fit.  They are very comfortable to wear.  I bought them so I could put them over leggings to keep warm while doing chores, but they are too nice for that!"
5.0,"By far"" these are the most comfortable shirts you'll ever wear........PERIOD!"
5.0,Very nice quality leather and very soft.

5.0,The watch was very beautiful
5.0,NEW FAV!
5.0,This Dual Sided Eye Care Case is the perfect carrying case for glasses and a contact lens case and drops
5.0,"So cute! Very comfortable and looks great.<br />The material is soft and light, and the color as pictured.<br />Fits well and very comfortable, but roomy in half for women with C/D cups<br />Overall a good product and I would recommend"
5.0,I love this dress! Material was thick and very warm! I ordered a small which fit perfect on the arms and chest but the waist was very flowy so I added a belt. There is significant stretch which makes it comfortable to move around in.
5.0,"Very attractive, feels and looks durable. I think I got my money's worth. Thanks."
5.0,Awesome. My girls love them
5.0,I would like it a little bit bigger in the hip area.  Other than that I love it.
5.0,"Lightweight fabric, fits well, v v cute"
5.0,These shoes are so elegant for a little toddler. They are perfect for a special occasion. They fit as expected and look really cute on. They are nice quality as well. They don‚Äôt have any leases which is perfect for kids and they are easy to slip on and off.
5.0,Love the turquoise tone it has and is very comfortable. It has a 2 inch extender for thicker wrists. I recommend highly.
5.0,I purchased this cap after reading a review that was posted by someone with locs like myself. I have no regrets. The product is comfortable and lightweight.
5.0,Love it‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è
5.0,More sturdy that it looked and comfortable to wear.

5.0,I love these!  Summer fun!
5.0,Comfortable and fit perfect!
5.0,Beautiful! Mother-in-law lived it for a Christmas present. Great starter charm for what will be a beautiful bracelet soon !
5.0,Love it is beautiful so soft will definitely order more
5.0,Love it.  Exactly as pictured and fits perfectly.
5.0,"Great selection, pls no on buying more!"
5.0,I bought these slippers for my husband after reading the reviews.  He tried them on and doesn't feel comfortable in them because he's never worn slippers that have an open back and a slip-on plus he much prefers to wear a full slipper with a support in the back of his heel.  This is not to say that this isn't a comfortable slipper for someone who doesn't like this kind of slipper.  So I'm going to give it a 5 star review because it's well made and even included a pair of supports to slide into the shoe for added support.
5.0,"Great eyeglasses, really neat , brand new came with it's case and wipe."
5.0,"I LOVE this totally unique whatever it is!  It's like a long, sweatshirt, dress, coat thingie and I've never seen anything else like it.  It's well made and I love the very long back that ties at the bottom.  The tabs on the front are a really decorative touch.  I'm short and chubby at 5 feet 3 inches and 187 pounds.  I bought the extra large and it fits well, but certainly isn't an oversized look.  I thought about sending it back and getting the next size up, but I think then it would be too wide in the shoulders.  I did have to roll up the sleeves because I have short arms.  I REALLY like this and am going to keep it and wear it with boots and patterned leggings.  BUYER BEWARE WHEN CHOOSING COLORS:  The color I purchased is listed as ""army green"" , but the color in the photo is definitely not army green....it's more like a forest or hunter green...much brighter than army green.  HOWEVER, when you receive the product, you will see that IT'S A TRUE ARMY GREEN. It would be helpful if the photos' were closer to the actual color.  I bought leggings to wear with it and they don't match at all.  I can't speak for the blue, but the green you definitely are not getting what you're looking at.  BUY THIS....you'll love it!"
5.0,"I love the necklace, only thing is the wording is ALOT smaller than it appears online"
5.0,"comfortable, warm.  Elastic not too tight. Love 'em. Would buy again."
5.0,Grandson loves the shirt
5.0,Fits very well and does fog up my glasses. Components went together easily. Im very satisfied!
5.0,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this purse!!! So much room that I can fit my bible, Vera Bradley wallet, and personal journal and a few makeup necessities in it among the pockets that are already filled with stuff!!! Love the design and I've had A LOT of compliments since I bought it. Very durable and I honestly think this is the first purse out of MANY that I have that's lasted this long!!! Thank you so much!!"
5.0,just right for the team
5.0,Very good I like it.
5.0,"I love the look of these glasses, had them for a few weeks now and they seem like good quality build."
5.0,"Great tee short,soft comfortable,got many compliments on it."
5.0,regret the size i picked but colour is amazing
5.0,Super cute.. but had to pin the lace straps as they are super long
5.0,Looks cute on daughter
5.0,Love the fit and look
5.0,"These are great!  Very easy to put on your dogs collar and durable.  I like them because they have 3 light options - fast flash, slow flash and constant.  Those lights that hang with your dogs tags I feel distract them and can be disorientating for them.  These are muted lights, because of the colored housing.  I put it on the collar on the back of their neck so it does not distract them yet I can see them clearly."
5.0,Fluffy and comfortable for is very affordable price!
5.0,"I own a professional DJ & Karaoke company, so I bought and wear this for Packer Party‚Äôs I host. They seem to be pretty good quality, because I wear it every Packer Game for over a year now, and haven‚Äôt had any problems."
5.0,LOVE THESE EARRINGS SO MUCH ! they are all lightweight. Looks just like pics! Would purchase again and again
5.0,Got them for my daughters second holes.
5.0,Love these! I'm wearing them right now in New Orleans! Girl's trip for my friend's bachelorette weekend! Perfect & just long enough for making sure you don't get that chub rub. Bought some for my mother & sister as well.
5.0,Great sunglasses! I wasn't sure about the the strength I would need but after reading through all of the descriptions I went with a 3. Perfect! The lens are dark enough for reading in very bright sunlight and they are easy to walk in with the bifocal (I've had problems walking in bifocals with other glasses). I bought an additional pair for back-up.
5.0,"I got this scarf a week earlier than expected, which is good, considering it came all the way from China.  Mary who I assume works for the company or owns it, has very good taste, as well as I do. I have four of these scarves in different colors and styles.  I hope to get many more to go with my extensive wardrobe. I consider myself a &#34;Dandy&#34; and these scarfs add to my style.  Thank you Mary, and may good fortune continue to follow you in the future<br />From Eric in Colorado, USA"
5.0,"Flattering, no fuss for everyday or vacation. Started with 1 but definitely adding more! Knee length on me means it hits right below the knee so if you want to hide your knees this is perfect. Great for dressing up or down."
5.0,I bought this wallet for a co worker for her B day since she had a Mario one and LOVES Yoshi.  When she opened it she cried!  She adores it!!!!!
5.0,Stunning dress.  Hubby bought this for me because I've always wanted a some green dress.  Perfection!
5.0,Great. It's bigger than I imagined. It really sands out. I have other lapel pins and this one really is a eye catcher.
5.0,Perfect match for dress my daughter wanted to wear for a formal.
5.0,The colors are pretty
5.0,The style and desert camouflage
5.0,"I got this for my special needs grandson. I thought it was regular sweatshirt fabric, but it‚Äôs a thinner polyester fabric. He rubbed it on his face! That means he likes it. And he loves blue. We should all enjoy the simple pleasures in life ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5.0,Shape Sunblock Feels great
5.0,"These are the most comfortable masks I have found so far! They are pretty breathable and fit my face well. The colors are fun, too!"
5.0,I absolutely love this outfit it's a perfect fit. My measurements are height 5 5 164 lb 38 bust 26 waist 32 hips. I ordered a medium in blue. Its a very thick and stretch-like material. However the belt I wrapped around my neck as a bow because I did not like it around my waist. See picture
5.0,Pretty and delicate. Just right for my sister.
5.0,Feels super soft and fits like it was custom made. A perfect dress for the summer and any day. Love it!!!
5.0,I love when clothes fit true to size. If the skirt on this was oversized it would be really unflattering but this was cut in a way to not be too big. The smocked top was tall enough to give a more flattering fit as well. Sometimes when the top is too short the dress will look like a maternity dress. Also gives room for a larger chest but still tight enough for a smaller chest. The only draw back is the print is weird. I got the one that says leopard but it is brown fabric with white little c chaped blobs. My fault for clicking on impulse and not enlarging the print. This print in brown looks a bit dated. If I would have looked closer I would have chosen a different color. This would be so much better with an actual leopard print. I'm keeping anyway.
5.0,Works always for all kinds of shoes
5.0,I get so many compliments on this bag.
5.0,I love them. Great quality! Amazing price. Better than expected
5.0,Nice size color is great!

5.0,Its actually nicer than I was expecting. Purchased for my 15 year old daighter who 5 foot (exactly) tall and the length was perfect for her.
5.0,Love this hat.  Just as advertised.  I have a big skull (would have said big head but that has other connotations :) and the hat fits just fine.  Very comfortable.  The brim comes pre-bent and looks great.  Excellent hat.
5.0,Worked out great for my garage
5.0,Like the ability to use different shoes and invisible
5.0,"Good fit. The stitching inside is too thick. I wear them inside out. The material is supposed to be 80% cotton and 20 polyester but feels the other way round. However, suits me fine and amm satisfied with this product, somewhat expensive, though."
5.0,"A sweet bag!  This bag is the the perfect size for all my needs and it looks amazing.  I'll never fill all the pockets, but it'll be fun to try.  I'm glad I bought it."
5.0,"These are my five-year-old daughter's favorite socks, though I bought them for our hikes.  She wears them every time she finds them washed."
5.0,"Love it, super cute and I got a compliment the first time wearing it"
5.0,"100% metal free, great for going through security."
5.0,These came quick and were just the small every day earrings I was looking for.
5.0,I purchased two machine wallets about 5 months ago. Gun metal for my dad and black anodized for my self. We both carry them every day. I love the simplicity of them and the slimness of it. I don't think I could go back to a normal bill fold.
5.0,Love it and is a very nice present
5.0,"Love this shirt, great fabric, super cute, good buy!"
5.0,bought for a friend and she looks so sexy in this shirt....fits great and arrived very fast

5.0,"I have a Pandora bracelet and was always saddened they only have breast cancer ribbons (as a survivor I support all canacer awareness) and never had Hodgkin's Lymphoma ones, or even a generic ribbon.<br /><br />Bought this around the day that I was diagnosed on, 14 years ago. Its a nice, encouraging charm I look at everyday. A reminder on how to keep living life and be grateful for each day!<br /><br />Thank you from a survivor."
5.0,"When you want to feel like royalty in your pants, get some satin boxers."
5.0,"I absolutely love this necklace. It goes with so many outfits, and is such a fun statement piece. Admittedly, one stone did fall off, but I love it so much anyway."
5.0,Cool steampunk jewelry.  Has weight to it.  Serves its purpose.
5.0,"I didn‚Äôt realize it when I ordered hats from this company. How‚Äôs, it was great and came in 10 days!"
5.0,"Love this product and being able to wear a hair tie without cutting off circulation to my hand. It‚Äôs lasted really well, no scratches or significant wear. Would buy it again."

5.0,It was a gift for a family member- they loved it! I can‚Äôt speak on how it feels on I just know they loved the hat!
5.0,Great quality and arrived quickly-very happy with the purchase.

5.0,"I really love and appreciate this cellphone bag. I bought it in the hope that it would carry my cellphone on me while I took my daily walk, and it has really lived up to my hopes and then some! Lightweight, easy to get in and out of, especially for a walker and comfortable. Fits the bill!"
5.0,Medium fit perfectly love these pants so comfy will be ordering more
5.0,This gown is so beautiful.  My 6 year old and her friends love it.
5.0,Quality and Price
5.0,"Received the wallet today - ahead of schedule. Leather is soft and supple. It weighs less than my previous wallet even with everything in it and it's a slightly smaller size which is great. I feel much better about my ID and credit cards with this wallet. The only thing I would recommend to the company is to make gussets on both sides of the coin section so the coins are easier to get out but that's a very minor thing. Although I haven't any way to check to be sure the wallet actually blocks my info, I feel sure it does after having read all the reviews of people who have tested it. I will probably buy my husband a wallet in the near future."
5.0,Love this sweatshirt!
5.0,"My son is not quite 2 years old and we had bought a different brand of glasses, which he broke. These are very durable and flexible, as I watched him pull the arms of the glasses put away from each other I anticipated him breaking this pair also, but they have held up well! Thanks for a quality product!"
5.0,I like the bag. It‚Äôs compact and have no issues with it. Feels well constructed and durable for every day use. Replaced my purse with it. Would recommend to my friends.
5.0,"Fast shipping, love the quality, size and color, well pleased."
5.0,Nice quality costume.
5.0,"I bought this as an Xmas gift for my MIL.  She loves to travel, hike, go on cruises and I thought this would be a good gift she could stash her car key, ID, money and phone in.  She really like the scarf and the color is a beautiful blue.  Great gift for someone who likes to keep their hands free and may not want to carry a bag."
5.0,Huge gravity falls fan and this is my favorite shirt.
5.0,"Nice light earrings, really pretty"
5.0,"Nice, thick sweater. Looks exactly like the picture. Arrived very quickly. Fit is just a little smaller than I thought, but I love this sweater."
5.0,Love how these fold flat and fit in the back of a Denim pant pocket.
5.0,Fits so well! I got so many compliments!
5.0,These are so comfortable and cute.
5.0,"In black and gold, it looks like its far more famous unrelated cousin. ;) Keeps good time and looks nice.  The band is fine, comfortable, and very pleathery, though I had a little problem with prong getting stuck in one of the holes initially, and the prong is a little wobbly.  However, for the low, low, low price, still exceptional if you like fun knock-offs at beyond bargain bin prices. :).  Good for a knockaround watch and if you break it, you won't cry. :)"
5.0,Bought these for myself. Love them! Haven't snagged or come loose at all.
5.0,Looks good good comfort
5.0,Love everything about this sweater. Colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect.
5.0,Lightweight material is so much cooler but the fabric is very strong. Excellent short for hot summer months!
5.0,Could not have asked for a perfect fit.
5.0,Pros: It's great to go for a walk in the summer heat without getting a rash from chub rub.<br />Cons: The more you wear and wash these the weaker the stretch/elastic gets.
5.0,"My grandchildren were so cute on Christmas, the merchandise arrived quickly and fit very well, good quality."
5.0,Perfect fit and keeps my toes warm and nice  cushioning on the heal. Great for<br />Tradesmen. I‚Äôm an electrician and on my feet up to 11 hours some day. Thumbs up
5.0,Omg I was so scared about this product as for me wasting my money but once it came in the mail today I was truly amazed at how shiny and beautiful it was. I ordered a 3.3mm 22in chain and it is perfect I wish the diamond cut was on both sides of the necklace but it is still very very beautiful and worth every penny.
5.0,"Perfect hoodies. Right size and quality like the good old days. Soft, yet durable."
5.0,"Very pretty, fast delivery, and inexpensive piece of costume jewelry."
5.0,"Great fit, follow instructions to ensure you buy the right size. Great color, great price."

5.0,good looking watch
5.0,"Great helmet, fits perfectly."
5.0,VERY COOL SWATCH WATCH ! LOVE THE SEE THRU DESIGN? THIS WATCH IS A GREAT GIFT. MY GRAND SON WILL LOVE THIS WATCH FROM THE 80s.  EVERYTHING FROM THE 80s is new again. WOW ITS COOL
5.0,Love this fits great feels good
5.0,Love it! Received very quickly!
5.0,"These are perfect for casual wear in cooler weather. They are as warm as heavier wool socks and seem to manage moisture better. BTW, these accidentally went in the dryer a few times with no shrinkage issues."
5.0,"My GF and I were looking for some different and nice looking wedding rings on the web, and we saw a black ring that i kinda liked, so i searched more black wedding rings and found this one.<br /><br />When i ordered it i was a little bit worried about how it would look like in real life, being black and a little oddly shaped.<br /><br />When it got here and i opened it from the nice looking bag it came with i was relived and very happy at what it looked like. I have to say it looks better in real life than on the pictures.<br /><br />If you like how it looks now you wont be disappointed."
5.0,Fast shipping!! Item was perfect.
5.0,"Outstanding I was not able to find jeans like this at any of the usual stores( Nordstrom, Macy's) They fit well are pretty comfortable and don't have a bunch of weird stuff like designs and fancy pockets going on and that is a big plus."
5.0,These leggings fit larger then expected. I would try them again in a size smaller. They are really soft and comfy. And I love the pockets. It seems after a couple washes the pockets lose some form though. Could just be the size though. Great price!
5.0,I honestly did not thing all my hair would fit. It's alot of braids that fit inside. pleasantly surprised actually. Cute design too. It was very snug when I first put it on but stretched just enough after a few minutes. I would recommend
5.0,"A little smaller than expected but it's the perfect size. Stays in pretty good. Real metal, not cheap looking. Good deal."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ed48ca2e5c9bebfc50395da50bb21aaa]] Perfecto, size perfecto, super liviano. Lo √∫nico √∫nico que no amo de el, es la luz. Pero lo comprar√≠a otra vez. M√°s que perfecto para su precio."
5.0,"My daughter wants to wear this every day. Warm, snuggle and SO cute!"
5.0,The shirt fits great!
5.0,"Beautiful, stylish bracelet! Can't believe how cheap it was. Fast shipment too!"
5.0,"Just got the luggage, looks great so far. I love that each one fully fits inside the next larger size. GREAT for when we are storing them. We're going to use them this weekend. I'll come back and change the review if they fall apart but they seem sturdy."
5.0,"These are so beautiful, the picture does not do them justice! My favorite is the multicolored one, because it reminds me of these rainbow disco ball rings I used to wear. They were ball shaped, crystal prisms that had a mirror at the base of them, and when directed at light, it looks like a rainbow inside of a crystal ball. I haven't seen one of those rings in years, so to have the rainbow colored one remind me of them makes me feel sentimental. I lost it temporarily, and nearly threw a tantrum. I found it on the floor a few hours ago, & that made my day. I was sooo close to buying another 8 pack just to get the 1 multi-colored one. I wasn't gonna pay for the individual when you get so much more for just double the price.<br /><br />The matte finish is absolutely fabulous btw."
5.0,After I got this one I went and got a other style of one both are good looking
5.0,"I bought these suspenders to complete my outfit for the annual neon themed party my wife and I go to.  Most attendees wear bright neon pink, blue and yellow 80's style clothes.  Not us...we'll be hard to miss in my light up suspenders and matching bow tie and her in her light up tutu!  As with all of my light up gear, I got these from Neon Nightlife because they have been durable and all items we have got from them have lit up all through the night and then some.  These surprisingly work well as actual suspenders too.  Not the most highly adjustable suspenders (although I admittedly don't have a ton of experience wearing suspenders) but they fit me well and stay clasped in place.  The part that lights up doesn't really stretch but the single elastic strap in back does so they move with you when you bend and stretch.  I received these suspenders at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I can't wait to wear them out to the next party!"
5.0,This sweater is soooo cute I love it
5.0,"They fit well! Working with them, they are so comfortable that I can move freely. The material is thick, love these totally recommended."
5.0,Love these leggings so much - I got a medium - they‚Äôre not squat proof tho so I only wear them for hikes or spin. Really nice design and fit. I am 5‚Äô 9‚Äù 145
5.0,"Cleans beautifully. Kinda has a mild citrus scent. Towel is really soft and gentle, but the stitching is falling off(not really important). The brush is able to effectively clean shoes in a pair of swipes."
5.0,Design is high quality and has lasted through multiple washes.  12 month size is actually a little on the large side but that's perfect because we want to have kiddo wear this onesie as much as possible!
5.0,Looks good. Item was as described. No surprizes. Pleasure doing business with them. Probably would do business with them again.
5.0,This shirt is so soft and fits as expected. I got a medium after reading the reviews because I like my shirts loose but a small would‚Äôve fit as well. It‚Äôs definitely yellow and not mustard like I thought but still very cute. So excited to wear this the day of Halloween!
5.0,Looove this purse sooo much. I had the same purse for ever (too long in most opinions) so i got this and im so happy with it. Thank you xx
5.0,"Nice material, feels very good on skin. Thanks"
5.0,I wore these when I got my radio active iodine therapy and the radiologist got a kick out of them. Made the day less of a drag and more fun for everyone.
5.0,"So excited to get these 100% cotton socks! üòçü§© Love the plastic free packaging too... üíû‚ôªÔ∏è As far as socks, I don't like thick socks and most thinner ones have polyester or nylon which feel gross and make my feet feel sweaty. üòï Can't wait to buy more colors!! Highly recommend this product. üòÉüëç"
5.0,My almost 8 year old loves them
5.0,saw so many kpop idols wearing it I had to get one. I wear it all the time around my house like a loser and I love it
5.0,loved them
5.0,"Bigger than I thought it would be, but that's cool because it stands out more. Love it."
5.0,I jut like the style of the watch Nd. Reminded of what the date is when I look down at the time.
5.0,"Great item! I use it as a small cosmetic bag for lip gloss, scissors, tweezers. The little items that get lost. Light weight and attractive. Fast shipping!"
5.0,"Very nice looking, easy to put on, seems well made.  Have received compliments on it."
5.0,Super cute! Love these they match anything! BUT size down do not size up they are very wide and run big other then that very cute and comfy!
5.0,Comfortable and cozy!
5.0,This is warm and very soft material. Love it.  Fits great.
5.0,Love it ....
5.0,"When I ordered onei was not sure about the quality or performance. But when I received it, I was pleasently surprised. The build quality bis awesome. Please refer to the attached pictures. The vest feels premium quality. There is a USB connector for connecting a power source. I ordered a suitable power bank (picture attached) and it works very well.<br /><br />I tested the heating and it works really well. Most of the time, low heat setting is good enough in not-so-cold weather.<br /><br />The operation is very simple. Long press the power button to switch ON / OFF. Each short press of the power button changes the temperature setting from HIGH (button glows red) to MEDIUM (button glows white) and then to LOW (button glows blue).<br /><br />I own three of these and all have same performance and quality. The manufacturer's quality control process seems to be good."
5.0,i LOVE THIS DRESS
5.0,"This is a great product.  Shines all precious metals and brass/bronze easily.  I can't think of a better product for delicate items such as gold, silver or bronze jewelery."
5.0,"This watch band fits well and was easy to install, just took five minutes."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,These were perfect for our Disney outing!
5.0,These are perfect dupes! They fit well and don't feel cheap. Buy them!
5.0,"I feel spoiled by these.  All other glasses I have purchased were somewhat uncomfortable.  Because of the design of the lenses, (larger than most I have had) I forget I have them on."
5.0,GO FROGS!!!! Very elegant and proud bowtie!!!
5.0,"Bought for my 17 yr. old granddaughter who is large busted.  This dress is very complimentary, and fits well.  The ruffle adds a nice detail on the top.  The colors are bright and look great on her darker skin."
5.0,Cute!!  I'm 5'7&#34; 125lbs and the medium fits perfect. I ordered purple and I receive compliments every time I wear it.
5.0,Just what I needed for work
5.0,It‚Äôs an asset. It holds the hair so no need to broom and sits well. The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like is that the opening gap between the velcro closing is big enough to get some hair in on the neck so that needs an adjustment.
5.0,Very comfortable and stylish. Warm. Don't even think about trying to use your touch screen. It ain't happening.
5.0,"Perfect date night outfit. Went to see Dave Chappell in this... comfortable, flirty, and accentuate your body. The shirt fits really good. I didn't need a bra and ima a 34ddd :)"
5.0,My daughter love it. Its incredible cute.
5.0,"Good price, fast service I will order again"
5.0,I love these leggings. I have bought several pairs in different lengths and patterns. They are lightweight but not see thru. They are very stretchy. They fit over the belly which gives a flattening effect. And they have nice deep pockets! My galaxy s7 edge phone fits perfectly in the pocket.
5.0,Pretty!! Comes in a nice little pouch
5.0,Looked great on my son for homecoming Dance
5.0,Gloves are very nice.
5.0,"Cute, fit well."

5.0,I didn't know how dirty my silver jewelry was! It works great.
5.0,Nicely crafted neck
5.0,"MUY LINDOS, FELICITACIONES POR FABRICAR COSAS TAN CHEVRES, Y UTILES"

5.0,Cute Hat...
5.0,I think these earrings are great.  I purchased them as a gift for my daughter and hope she loves them as much as I do. Received them quickly and can't wait to give them to her this weekend.
5.0,"Sisters and friends were having a girls weekend, I  ordered the bracelets and let them pick what they wanted, they are fun.  There are a few plain bracelets, which look nice mixed with the colorful ones.  The colors are distinctive and rich and joyful, almost like dabs of an enamel.  Very inexpensive and just great with summer clothes."
5.0,this ring was absolutely a steal for dis price. great quality. fell for it as soon as i opened. shipped sooo fast.. im satistifed. gonna wear it jus 4 special occassions tho. not gonna wear it everyday n wear it out..
5.0,These are so cute and arrived on time!
5.0,Made out of heavy duty canvas so should last for years.  Has a great zippered pocket so I  can zip in my keys or phone with no fear if losing them.
5.0,These are cute they seem to help with my eye strain. They came packaged niceMy in a leather like case that came inside a soft baggy case. They came with a cleaning cloth as well as a test strip and blue light for testing.
5.0,Way better quality than I expected for $7. I love it so much!
5.0,This product fit good and was in great shape and fast shipping.
5.0,They are fliipin awesome love the way they fit. Me comfy ad heck
5.0,"super cute, comfy shorts. would def buy this brand again in more colors"

5.0,My niece loved this set!
5.0,I love the shirt.  Runs true to size.  Lots of compliments on the color
5.0,"Very sexy, snug fit, long enough for my long torso, and I love the criss cross arms. One of my favorite sweaters."
5.0,"We had been looking at purchasing a winder box for our automatic watches when my husband broke his wrist and isn't able to wear a watch for eight weeks.  While I was waiting for his surgery to finish, I found this Kingdoo Wooden Watch Winder Box and made the purchase.  The case arrived quickly, and we were thrilled with the quality of this product.  After a couple quick installation steps, the watches were being wound.<br />We have now had this case for a few weeks, and are still very pleased with our purchase.  We are storing five watches, three are automatic watches, and there is still room for more.  Even though the cast will come off his wrist in a few weeks, we are so happy to have this case to keep the watches running."
5.0,My daughter in law loves it! She‚Äôs a big Disney fan.
5.0,"Great bracelet.  It's easy to get on and off, and once it's on, it looks very nice.  I find it to be quite comfortable, as well, but it does seem to be on the smaller side.  I have small wrists, and this bracelet fits me perfectly."
5.0,little small but one size up
5.0,It did not hold up a small adult and we as not sturdy in any way
5.0,This is perfect for a guy- comfortable- soft- and very warm.
5.0,"This is a flashy shirt, well made and people comment all the time when I wear it"
5.0,I bought this for my very pregnant daughter. I also bought one for myself.  The elastic waist is perfect for both of us  highly recommended.
5.0,Love these!! & how they fit!!!
5.0,"I bought my 1st set of these compression socks right after I had my total knee replacement surgery.  They are simply the best, highest quality compression socks that I have experienced."
5.0,Shoes are great
5.0,These socks are not the thin socks.  Very comfortable and just the right thickness!
5.0,These are great shorts for workouts but look nice enough for casual wear too. They fit well and I like the pockets.
5.0,"Seriously love this dress! Fits great and flattering, just waiting until they have a small in color back so i can buy another one!"
5.0,I ordered these for a Disney visit and they were perfect.
5.0,"Bought as a gift for daughter, good fit and she loves the prints."
5.0,"Super soft and warm, beautiful colors, nice and wide- shawl or scarf appropriate- gave this as a gift."
5.0,"I get a lot of compliments, it moves nicely, just the right amount of swing. Color is lovely. It's not pilling or anything so far. I wear it with a straight skirt sometimes for a different look, as it seems a bit dressier than you might think from the picture. Runs a little large."
5.0,"I like that these locking cord loops allow me to use my trekking umbrella hands free. They come ""unassembled"", so I can make a custom installation on my pack strap that looks well-finishes when done.  I've been a fan of Six Moon Designs for many years, using their Gatewood cape/shelter as my combination UL solo shelter and rain gear. Combined with their Serenity net option, it's a weather tight, bug-free system. I'm a fan. (No, they don't pay me!)"
5.0,Beautiful dress.  Very comfortable. Shoes and jewlery adjustment make this dress go from causual to semi formal. Received lots of complements. Love it and you will too.
5.0,"Love it! Leather seems a little flimsy, but that also makes it comfortable. Haven't needed to trim to fit yet, but it comes with a tool to help with that.<br />Came in a great looking box and would make an appropriate gift."
5.0,"My 7-year-old son loves these goggles. They are spacious and comfortable, unlike some other ones  with a more narrow frame."
5.0,I keep my hair protected with this product. I hope you all create more colors soon.
5.0,"LOVE IT SOOOOO MUCH! Looks great! It's a tad long, which is how I like it. But just for general comparison, I don't have to unhook it to put is over my head. And I also have a fairly large head so take that into consideration. And there are no adjustment links."
5.0,Wish it came in more colors.
5.0,"Looking at them in the picture, I thought I would be getting silver with some spherical stones affixed to the silver, but that isn't what these are. The stones are disk shaped wrapped in wire.<br /><br />Nevertheless, even though the earrings were different than I had pictured in my mind, they're still gorgeous, and I'm quite pleased with them."
5.0,"I have already reviewed these earrings. I love them so much that I ordered another pair. The earrings are classic style with the brilliant cut cubic zirconia stone an elegant round that has a 4 prong mounting. The studs are Nickel free and white-gold finish to prevent tarnishing. This is a very dainty, shiny, and excellent quality stud with a secure back to keep the earring stable. These earrings are lightweight and once on, I forget they are on. I definitely recommend these earrings."
5.0,"So soft, washes well, good fit! I bought every color I like them so much"
5.0,It is what you expect it to be. Feels great. Didn't even have to fidget with it or adjust it all day. I'm 6'0 245 lbs so probably average wrist. Worth the money. Will probs buy more.
5.0,Love it can‚Äôt say enough about it
5.0,Vuarnet quality at a budget price.  Amber lenses which make for a seemingly brighter view.
5.0,"I found these same flannels for sale at my local Costco and bought all of the different patterns...I loved the way they fit so much that I took to Amazon to see what other options there were and this was the only one I found that I didn't already own. They were definitely a better price at Costco, but with their quality and excellent fit I found that even the slightly higher price on here was still a steal!"
5.0,Gave as graduation gift.  She loved it especially the clasp.
5.0,"I gave this 4 out of 5 stars, since the accent strap is not tacked down but completely loose. Easy enough to fix at home but still. It is exactly as described however"
5.0,My daughter loved this dress. Great look for a great price
5.0,I ended up buying another set so I can have one in every room.  It does the trick of knowing where your glasses are and keeping them protected.
5.0,"Yes, I look like a Linebacker on the sidelines when I wear it, but it is SO warm and SO comfy, I really don't care.  I loved it so much I gave SIX of them as gifts to my friends and family for Christmas.  Great quality.  Washable.  Great colors.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
5.0,Great made an looks perfect.
5.0,Honestly this sash magnet has saved me from loosing my sash in the rain and dirt. Today my pin broke and I used this to hold my pageant sash together! Thank you
5.0,This belt is lovely. It has a lot of stretch making it versatile for many sizes. I ordered an xl and I‚Äôm a 36‚Äù waistline. It pulls me in nicely without being too snug.
5.0,"great socks, fit well, and have gotten compliments on them (cute). full satisfaction."
5.0,"Grand daughter was pleased. As an 80 year old man, I cannot say I liked it."
5.0,"Looks cool, and is durable."
5.0,Looks a little washed out in color but its really comfortable
5.0,We used this as a prop fir a trade show Top Gun Theme and everyone loved it!
5.0,Shred a little but expected.  So snug and cozy!
5.0,"This is a lovely bracelet! Looks great on slim wrist and delicate hand. It has a clasp, so its sitting great on the wrist and doesn't overhung too much."
5.0,I love my belt. Great quality. Hope to see everyone wearing them. Makes me feel good.
5.0,"Since the price was so nice, I was not expecting such good quality. And they are very cute!"
5.0,smalle
5.0,Cheap made but looks great. Good for one time use and/or last min bargain buy
5.0,Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for for the trend.
5.0,"I got the vest as a gift from my sister, a frequent traveler. I first used it on a long trip overseas, but now I use it every day. No more purse to keep track of and everything I need is organized, easy to get to and safe. It was great on my trip. You'll be amazed at the number of items this vest can carry. Made getting through airport security easier -- just sling it on the belt with your carry-on and you don't have to empty your pockets or send your purse or wallet through. I always felt safe in dicey areas because the vest keeps everything hidden and zipped up snug against your body. Some reviews here note the zippers can be a bit difficult, and that's true. They do not slide open easily, but I see that as a good thing. More secure that way. These vests run on the small side. I suggest ordering one size up. I throw the vest in the washing machine on the cold setting and hang it to dry and that seems to work fine. After six months of daily use, it shows no sign of wear, but I'm thinking of getting a second one as a backup because the vest truly makes life easier for me and I don't want to be without one."
5.0,Such a cute set for little ones. The tail was a little long but is to be expected being it is a mermaid. I gave it as a gift and everyone loved it.
5.0,The gray color is very pretty. The cutout design is attractive. The material is soft and light. Item arrived fast.
5.0,"This bag is beautiful! Really nice quality, easy to hold, comes with an extra strap, very sparkly, and a good size. Perfect for a night out, definitely recommend!"
5.0,Love I can fit everything!! Small pockets for makeup as wel
5.0,It fits right over my glasses . It doesn‚Äôt modify the way you see with your glasses still clear vision.
5.0,"On my feet throughout most of the day, and these help so much. I even continue to wear them after I get home."
5.0,"Well made, and well worth the wait from China, I bought 10 Black and 10 White.  They fit nicely in the mailbox.  These are quite comfortable to wear, some may think that they are a bit tight, but better tight than loose.  I usually wear mine with either a baseball hat or pith helmet when working in the yard.  These are quite excellent, and absorb and dissapate sweat well."
5.0,"I love these. Sexy, pretty, lightweight and fun<br />I especially enjoy the color."
5.0,"Wife loves these, she says comfy and perfect length."
5.0,"I wish it was as long on me as in the picture, but it's mid-calf/ballet length (I'm 5'8&#34;).  Apart from that I like it--very comfy and practical"
5.0,Halloween made easy
5.0,Love these- sturdy
5.0,Dress fit great!
5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from the fabric description and anticipated perhaps a ""stretchy"" cheap feel. Much to my surprise the fabric is nicely woven and I'm actually going to order it in black as well. I normally wear a small and that is what I ordered, fits exactly as it should, not skin tight...just the perfect fit."
5.0,Like the way they are made.
5.0,These tights are very strong (durable) and very comfy. My girls and I are happy with them. They wear them to church under a dress.
5.0,"Great quality fabric, the front has held up in the wash really well. True to size. Might get another one for my daughter!"
5.0,"Great product, great company. Will order again."
5.0,I've tried a number of different versions and types of no-tie shoelaces and I can honestly say that these are by far my favorite. Even though they're not sold through Amazon Prime (which is usually a very important factor for me when choosing between similar products) these are totally worth it. They're easy to put in your shoes and look really clean and nice.
5.0,"Sleeves are a little long, but other wise perfect."
5.0,My feet stay warmer with these
5.0,"I bought this tie for the Halloween season, but like one other reviewer I plan to wear it throughout the year.  This is a polyester tie that is of excellent quality and an outstanding buy for the money.  I am used to paying in the range of $35-45 for a tie and while this is not a silk tie it looks great and does not, in my opinion, look at all like a cheaper tie.  The color and design is attractive and when I wore it for the first time several people commented positively on it.  I wear it primarily with a black suit but it also looks great with an olive colored suit as well."
5.0,"Love it and it came on time ,,its warm and fits perfectly"
5.0,"got this after my kid's last rash guard basically disintegrated after weekly use. Hoping this one will hold up longer but seems good so far, thicker material than the last."
5.0,I love this necklace. It‚Äôs not too big or too small. It‚Äôs a perfect little necklace to wear out on a date or grocery shopping. Love it!!!
5.0,I love this charm.  I bought it for my sister in law who loves dragonflys.  I was very pleased with the quality and it is very lovely.
5.0,"I had bought this for my wife, and she loves it. She has washed it a couple times and there seems to be no wear and tear on it. Great material to!"
5.0,Fits well. Very airy. Better than the dozens of other ones I have purchased. I have an allergy to the sun and so I have purchased many of the arm cooling and protection... This one is the best fitting one I have ever found.
5.0,Good quality and great style. I love it!  And it fits perfectly!
5.0,thick durable poncho for the price
5.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): Great hiking pants!  They are comfortable and fit well (they actually run a little large so if you are between sizes you may want to order down).  The fabric is awesome - sturdy and stretchy.  I am 5'5"" and the length is just right.  The waist line is comfortable.  I love the pockets.  The front hip pockets and the front thigh pockets are all deep enough to hold an iPhone.  And they are zippered!  The material is thin but not see-through at all."
5.0,"Very happy with my purchase! The feel of the purse is just like leather and it's very attractive.  The size is small, but it actually holds a lot.  Having the wrist strap makes it just right for having use of both of your hands, but keeping your necessities close."
5.0,Exactly what I wanted. Shipping was quite slow and my delivery date changed 2 times but definitely worth the wait!
5.0,Very absorbant and easy to fit for my 95 year old mother!
5.0,"Beautiful dress, great price!"
5.0,Cute and comfortable dress for pregnant woman!

5.0,Durable ! Works well so far.
5.0,Omggggggggg I wore this dress for a Tea party bridal shower and everyone loved it! I will say the zipper was pretty tricky but I was able to zip up with no problems. I'm 5'5 150 and purchased a med and it fits like a glove ;-).
5.0,"Looks just like the picture , strong and works well."
5.0,Estos calcetines son s√∫per c√≥modos y de buena calidad. Me gustaron bastante!
5.0,Absolutely love this bracelet . . the magnet clasp was a bonus.
5.0,"So SO SOFT! It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre wearing nothing at all! Best thing ever, in this humid tropical island air, to sleep in~thank you so much!<br />Mahalo nui loa!"
5.0,My wife really likes this one.
5.0,The rope was exactly as it was pictured.  Thank you!
5.0,"Really like this band.  Very thin, very light, high quality, very malleable."
5.0,Got these in two different colors...they fit great...I love them!
5.0,"Absolutely love this tote, it is a little bigger than I expected but I still love it. It is about the size of a large purse, has a zipper on the backside and two large pockets in the front."

5.0,Bellos y c√≥modos
5.0,Strong Momma Women Of God! Fits nice/nice color. Washes well.
5.0,fit pretty tight. Nice quality
5.0,Nice bag but I returned it because I thought the trim was silver not gold.  I don't care for gold.
5.0,super cute and decent quality‚Äîgreat price. For reference: 5‚Äô8 130lb 26‚Äô‚Äô-26.5‚Äô‚Äô waist and M fit like a charm and wasn‚Äôt too short or too snug. Little hard to pull up at first but I blame the booty. Waist fits perfect. I would size up if you‚Äôre basing your size off the chart provided. I would not have been able to squeeze into a small even though the chart says 26‚Äô‚Äô waist.
5.0,"These boots are absolutely GREAT!  So comfortable and so cute!  No break in - they feel like an old pair of tennis shoes when you put them on.  I absolutely LOVE them!  Amazon offered a great price too.  I bought my first pair at Dillards - total with tax was about $150.  Decided I wanted them in another color too, so I shopped online.  Through Amazon, I got a great discount and free shipping!  Total cost of the boots was $75!  Gotta love that!"
5.0,This was exactly what I was looking for. The large size hold my big crystals. The neutral color matches everything too. These are quick to open and swap out crystals too. You get and assortment of sizes with this pack.
5.0,"I didn't know what to expect from these glasses, but they were perfect. Everything is metal, except for the nose piece of course, and they fit how I expect Aviator style glasses to fit. They aren't to dark and may not block light very well at first, but the make your eyes adjust to the bright light fast and you can see without having darkened vision. Would buy again. Bought one for a friend as well and he enjoys them very much, especially since they are very stylish."
5.0,"Great hat‚Ä¶, wrong size‚Ä¶ darn it"
5.0,"good quality, cute"
5.0,"this is just a great slip dress. the top is a bit tight so if you are busty size up but I love the look and it is lined well, hangs beautiful so much to love about this dress."
5.0,"I got this for my husband and he loves it. Not super high quality but not really cheap either. Decent bracelet for a good price. If it breaks no big monetary loss, but regardless, the design is really pretty and hubby says it's very comfy to wear. If he's happy with it, I'm happy with it."
5.0,Happy i bought them.
5.0,Love my belt. The only thing I wish is the company would offer different sizes it is very long on my size 4 waist. I put it through my belt loops to hold it down.
5.0,"I love my new purse, great size, great color, a bargain at the price, great quality, very, very, happy!"
5.0,Buying for a family member don't know yet how much she would like it.
5.0,Love love this charm. Wish the birth stone was a little bigger and the pearl a little smaller.  But looks great on my bracelet
5.0,This wallet is so nice - much nicer than I was expecting! My husband opened it and the first thing he said was that it smells so good - who doesn‚Äôt love a nice leather smell. It‚Äôs got plenty of card slots and I like that it‚Äôs RFID blocking. It looks much more expensive than it is.
5.0,my son love it
5.0,Greatest thing
5.0,it's a good wallet
5.0,This belt feels much more luxurious than $25-$45 department store ones!  Even the packaging is impressive.

5.0,This set was absolutely perfect for my sons birthday party. Everything looked great and we had a lot of complements on it.
5.0,band is too long won't fits losely
5.0,Great snap
5.0,"This is a very pretty 100% polyester scarf. Very thin and slick.  It measures 24‚Äù square.  If you place your mouse over the hearts, you‚Äôll see that they look a little ‚Äúrustic‚Äù.  But the rest of the design is very crisp and clear.  This scarf is Made in China.  The craftsmanship looks fine.  Depending upon how you wear it, you may need a pin or broach to hold it in place.  Overall I really love it."
5.0,Love it. Itis so cute and the dog looks just like my dog.
5.0,"I was afraid they were going to come in a pack of 3 with the same character. But they were all 3 different .  The picture/light is very good color very good quality. My won carries them every, everyday and they are still holding up."
5.0,Hermosos
5.0,"These are a pair of very cute earrings! They are fashionable enough to go with any outfit and small where they aren't as overly obnoxious and won't weigh down your ears. Overall, 10/10"
5.0,"This is the PERFECT üëåüèª summertime nightgown!!!! Supper supper soft, a little see through but I LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è it!!! Highly recommend this!!!"
5.0,"These slipper boots are exactly what I was looking for!  I have a high arch and wear a size C width.  Some similar slipper types were too snug across the top of my foot.  If I ordered up a size, they were sloppy big.  These are a perfect, generous fit, but are not sloppy feeling on my foot as I did order a size up.  With my size up I can wear a pair of socks with these slipper boots if I please.  However, if I choose to snuggle down into the fleece lining, that works just as well.  I have ordered another pair.  Let me say I am one of those people that thinks of others first and then think of myself last.  Hey, with these I am inspired to order another pair right now...thinking of myself, as these are so comfortable.  Might I add, they are cute, too!"
5.0,"Ellazhu is the store that you must have on your list of stores to shop from. The quality of their clothing is terrific. Excellent craftsmanship and gorgeous designs. When I received this dress I had to gasp in awe at how beautiful the colors are and the design is A one. I say, give Ellazhu a try and you won‚Äôt be sorry. I‚Äôll be buying another item very soon before it‚Äôs gone. üëç"
5.0,The finish is gorgeous I love it
5.0,Arrived timely and fit perfectly.
5.0,My granddaughter wears it. She loves it. Thanks.
5.0,"I purchased this necklace for my daughters graduation, she recently completed her MBA. For her original College graduation, I presented her with a set of pearls which represent accomplishment/adulthood. For her MBA, I purchased a set of special Japanese Akoya pearls (I am Japanese). These pearls are luminescent and of very fine quality. She was very excited when she opened them, the packaging being very formal was impressive. Truly a special gift!"
5.0,Three masks with 6 filters. Very cute.
5.0,Comfortable. No blisters. Durable
5.0,"Perfect travel size bag. Holds my passport, phone, and wallet, comb, sunscreen, a pack of tissues, & a nail file. That's all I need, and everybody else can carry their own stuff. I'll never take a big bag on a trip again."
5.0,A little long but looks great with leggings!
5.0,"I love this dress, a belt/ something to cover the shoulders makes it perfect. Will be buying again"
5.0,Very nice T-shirts granddaughter loved them.
5.0,It is just gorgeous!
5.0,"Love, love love  this shoe... if you can get both I suggest you do they are soooo cute on. Fit is true to size where some Betsey's are narrow. I was concerned about the heel being too high, they aren't high at all (very comfortable) new favorite shoes (got both) but what shoe lover doesn't."
5.0,"If you are thinking about getting these get them. I wore with my waist trainer and it had me snatched. Everything is lifted and in place. Squat proof. It‚Äôs not see through, I even had people ask me if my butt was real with how good it lifted and made my butt looked. I love it bought it in every color."
5.0,"Super cool , their great"
5.0,"Good quality and comfortable. Depending on the fit you like, you could size up or down."
